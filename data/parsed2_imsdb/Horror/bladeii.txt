b if window
href b b blade ii by david goyer blade ii by david goyer pull back from a neon red cross ablaze in the cold december night to reveal an inner
city store front clinic
trash and leaves blow over wet snowy pavement
angle on a pale figure standing across the street
he looks feverish and strung out in serious need of a fix
this is jared nomak s
he starts towards the clinic
potential donors sit in a waiting area filling out forms leafing through informational material
a sign in the window reads se habla espanol
others read you are making a difference give life and become a platelet donor
we overhear a bored looking employee behind the information desk quizzing someone over the phone have you recently visited a tropical country
in the past twelve months have you gotten a tattoo non sterile acupuncture or undergone any ear skin or body piercing
we move past the employee to nomak waiting
nomak looks up
we get a better look at his face now he has a thin scar running from his lower lip down his chin
a childhood accident perhaps
a nurse smiles and motions for him to join her
shes carrying a clipboard
were ready for you now
nomak follows the nurse into a dimly lit hallway
we track their progress in a convex safety mirror suspended from the hallway ceiling as they pass all manner of medical supplies centrifuges an apheresis device etc
referring to her clipboard i see from your questionnaire that you dont have any immediate next of kin
not that im in contact with
nobody to call in case of an emergency
no apprehensive does that mean i cant be a donor
we came up with some unusual results on your blood test
nomak follows the nurse to a steel door were two security guards await them
both look bored paying little attention to the monitor which offers a view of the examining room beyond
there is also a small window with safety glass
guard opens the door following nomak and the nurse inside
guard remains behind manning the hallway
the nurse ushers nomak into the room indicating he should sit in a kind of reclining dental chair with arm and headrests
nomak notices a security camera mounted above
anxious how unusual
the nurse sets aside nomaks file looking uncomfortable
your blood has a very rare phenotype one thats quite valuable to people like us
what are you talking about
a kind faced doctor enters nodding to guard
its a good news bad news scenario jared
good news for us bad for you
the doctor and nurse smile baring fangs
we realize now that they are both vampires
the guard too
he grips nomak by the throat forcing him back into the restraint chair
as the vampire guard does so his hand brushes against nomaks jaw
the flesh on nomaks chin briefly separates along the scar almost as if it were a seam
the guard pauses and nomak laughs
definitely not the reaction the vampires were expecting from a potential victim
nomak starts to shake and twitch like hes going into some kind of seizure
the whites of his eyes bleed red
he throws his head back opening his mouth as a pair of razor sharp canines extrude from his gums
these are longer much more lethal looking than the fangs of the vampires and nomak lashes out knocking the guard backwards
the nurse screams
nomak clamps his mouth onto her throat slamming her back against the wall
the vampire doctor rushes to the door scrambling to unbolt it
nomak reaches for him howling with blood drunk laughter as he lifts the doctor up
nomak flings the doctor about like a toy using his body to smash the lights then the security camera above
we hear screams and horrible noises coming from the examining room
guard draws a gun and looks to the security monitor with alarm
the screen goes black
he looks to the small window trying to peer into the now darkened room beyond splash
a wave of blood smears across a window
a hand wipes a patch of blood away revealing nomaks baleful distorted eyes
guard starts to back away when bang
nomak slams against the other side of the steel door
the door begins to bend hand shaped impressions bulging outward as nomak starts to peel the door apart like it was an aluminum can
guard has seen enough
he turns and runs even as the door caves inward off its hinges
forward momentum sends the door sliding across the hallway floor where it trips up the guard
as nomak steps into the hallway
because of the lights above there are alternating pools of light and shadow in the hall
nomak advances towards us his face coming in and out of darkness
vampires with each pool of light his awful smile seems to distort further and further until his mouth seems to be widening all the way back to his ears
i fucking hate vampires
on the floor the vampire guard cries out in fear helplessly raising his hands to defend himself
nomak howls and leaps towards him us blacking out the screen with his hurtling form as we boom
a second story door flies open and five vampire thug wannabes come spilling out
they race down a flight of stairs tripping and tumbling over themselves
in descending order they are rush a pimped out vanilla ice clone wearing karl kani gear followed by jigsaw st
cloud t bag and exits just behind them eschewing the stairs completely and vaulting over the railing
he unholsters his mach pistol as he drops firing it as he lands in a cat like stance on the snowy ground below ba bang
a silver tipped bullet punches through t bags chest
he turns to ash even as his fellow vamps dash through the disintegrating cloud that used to be his body
the embers melt the snow where they land
a super charged foot chase ensues with hunter and prey moving at speeds in excess of anything a human would ever be capable of
were talking thirty five even forty miles an hour
running like a bull condensed vapor streaming from his mouth and nostrils
splashing through puddles of icy water storming through barriers of plywood and razor wire leaping over mountains of garbage bags
as they flatten a length of cyclone fencing like it was crepe paper
they scramble up an obstacle of waste bins leaping into the air pulling out his twin bladed boomerang as he runs
he flings the weapon
it twirls around catching and cutting the vampire completely in half
as the disintegrating halves of st
cloud fall to the side blade storms over the waste bin
the remaining vampires stumble into a narrower alley where a group of bums are warming themselves over a series of oil drum fires
jigsaw slips tripping over one of the burning oil drums catching himself ablaze
he doesnt give a shit
he keeps on running barreling his way into the back entrance of a cramped sweat shop
some kind of noodle factory filled with steam and equipment and yammering foreigners and here comes blade hot on the vampires heels shouldering workers aside and rush and the remaining
vamps spill out onto the street where a number of motorcycles are waiting for them two bmw r motorbikes and a tricked out panhead harley chopper with ape hanger handlebars
rush and segura leap atop their bmws
jigsaw rolls into a puddle of water dousing himself then jumps onto his chopper
as the vamps peel out bursts from the factory
segura revs his bmw trying to run him down
at the last second blade pivots aside like a matador
segura circles around for another try
blade leaps somersaulting through the air then lands on the back of the bike behind segura
blade pulls a retractable garrotte wire from the sleeve of his jacket and wraps it around seguras throat
with a violent twist blade decapitates segura
as the vampires headless body turns to ash before him blade leans forward and takes the controls of the speeding motorcycle
blade speeds after the other vamps
rush and jigsaw gun their bikes for all theyre worth
up ahead a line of construction barricades are blocking the way
the vampires power on through the barricades then abruptly brake before them is under construction
theres a twenty foot gap in the road where a portion is missing pieces of re bar poking out from the ends of the prefabricated sections
rush and jigsaw consider their options but then they hear the roar of blades engine as he comes screaming over the rise in the road
rush powers his chopper forward making the jump burning rubber as he lands on the far side
jigsaw torques his handle and follows rocketing towards the gap
as he snaps his hand up a trio of japanese throwing stars appearing between his fingers like a magicians cards
he flings the stars at jigsaws bike the throwing stars hit jigsaws back tire and the bike goes down vomiting sparks as it slides forward
jigsaw is flung forward like a ragdoll out over the gap in the overpass and whunk
jigsaw is impaled on the protruding re bar
he howls instantly disintegrating as blade makes the jump
rush cuts onto an on ramp powering his way onto the freeway
rush slouches low trying to cut wind resistance and will his bike faster
he hazards a look back
is gaining on him like demon of speed
rush pulls a tec firing back at blade
its no good
blade is nearly upon him unsheathing his sword from his back scabbard blade jabs his sword forward into rushs rear wheel
the bike locks up flips over bursts into flames
the whole screaming wreck slews forward showering sparks goes flying onto the road rolling over and over one of his legs snapping at a bone breaking angle
as he lies there moaning blade circles around sweeping past rushs decimated bike retrieving his sward from the burning wreckage
blade kills the engine on his own bike and dismounts
rush is pathetically trying to drag his broken body to safety
blade approaches placing his boot heel on the back of rushs neck forcing his face against the asphalt
he unholsters his mach pointing it at the vampires bleeding head
blades opening line tell me where he his now and ill consider you a loose end
close on a peeling wall mural smiling s cartoon cow winking at us licking her chops
the logo reads tasty
blades matte black charger rumbles into view and parks in front of the abandoned milk factory
blade steps out heaving an equipment sack onto his shoulder
three laconic vampire toughs are playing poker at a card table dealing out novelty nudie cards
we hear a noise
one of the vampires approaches a reinforced door
he slides open a viewing slot and peers through
the vampire turns back to his poker buddies shrugging nobodys th before the vampire can even finish his sentence blades sword punches straight through the door into his chest
he gasps and turns to ash as the sword disengages back out through the door and crash
the door explodes open sending clouds of burning vampire embers every which way
in walks blade grinning wickedly mach ready as the other two vampires rise pow
a silver hollow point hits the first one in the neck
another hollow point takes out the second
the vampires drop turning to ash
blade holsters his mach striding through vampire ash piles
the place is eerily quiet here in stark contrast to the mayhem of the last few minutes
just the steady low pitched hum of machinery
blade starts forward
up ahead a faint glow is emitting from behind an area thats been sectioned off with canvas tarps
blade sweeps one of the tarps aside are hidden inside
the first two are empty
a man is suspended within the third bobbing weightlessly in a sea of red plasma
his long gray hair floats about his face shrouding his weathered features
were not sure if hes sleeping or dead
old man old man whatve they done to you whistlers ace drifts around into view
blade shakes his head in sadness
he looks about for a way to extract whistler doesnt see any obvious means then crash
blade kicks through the glass
blood and fluids flood out around him as whistlers limp body tumbles partly down but hes still suspended by the wires and medical leads
blade unsheathes his sword severing the wires whistler falls into his arms
blade cradles him then the gunsmiths eyes abruptly snap open flooding with rage
blade staggers back as the howling horror that used to be his mentor wraps his hands around blades throat forcing him to the ground
whistler roars revealing a set of jagged fangs
why didnt you finish me off
i told you whistler slams the back of blades head against the concrete floor again and again punctuating his words with each slam blade knees whistler in the balls
whistler lets go cupping his groin as blade heaves him aside
blade strips off his gauntlets
whistler springs at him again
blade sinks his fist deep in whistlers stomach
as whistler doubles over blade twists whistlers hands behind his back cuffing his wrists together with a pair of titanium manacles
blade pulls a restraint hood from his equipment bag and quickly slips it over whistlers head cinching it tight
whistler doesnt stir
hes down for the count
blade pauses a moment catching his breath as he leans on whistlers still form
come on whistler
he rises heaving whistlers body over his shoulder
lets go home
blades battered charger knifes through the snow dusted urban blight like a shadow
boarded up businesses tent cities doorways bombed with graffiti throwups wherever this godforsaken gomorrah is its definitely a notch down on the misery scale from the city blade used to
up ahead the sprawl levels out giving way to an ice bound harbor wreathed in fog
blade drives on inured to the sqaulor
he made peace with the darkness a long time ago
the charger weaves its way through a maze of scrap metal and rusty shipping containers homing in on a sprawling warehouse thats been cordoned off by cyclone fencing and razor
utlra violent floodlights illuminate the area while security cameras keep a watchful eye
more uv lights flicker on
were in a massive loading elevator platform which hums as it ascends eventually reaching its destination with a booming clang
the doors at the rear glide open
blade guides the charger out
santas workshop by way of soldier of fortune
industrial equipment is strewn everywhere
mills old furnaces gutted vehicles an ad hoc surgical theater
we also notice the big rig which scud had been piloting
because of various leaking overhead pipes the floor is slick with a sheen of water
blade kills his charger looking around as he climbs out
blades voice echoes throughout the cavernous room
lock up your daughters people a handlebar moustached weed sucking stoner
thrift store chic wearing a jimmy walker dyn o mite
the dark knight returns
scud is lowering himself down from the ceiling on a rope and pulley system where hed been suspended in a safety harness doing some kind of electrical wiring job
he reaches the floor and unclips himself
we notice hes wearing a surfers charm around his neck thats been strung with vampire fangs
scud pulls a half smoked roach from behind his ear using a lighter in the shape of a womans torso to fire up
the flame jets from a hole in one of her tits
he takes a spicoli sized hit and offers the roach to blade
little toke of the smokage b
blade slaps it from his hand
knock it off
weve got work to do
blade opens the trunk
scud joins him
blade unfastens the hood slipping it off
immediately whistler sits up lunging at blade
blade gets whistler in a headlock choking him as he drags him out of the trunk
its like trying to wrestle a rabid pit bull
he looks to scud annoyed
you going to stand there crapping your pants or are you going to help me
scud steps forward tentative
together he and blade drag whistler kicking and screaming across the workshop forcing him into a small cell like room
blade throws whistler onto the concrete floor pinning him as scud quickly slips a series of chains around him which have been secured to the wall
the opposite wall is covered by a series of steel shutters
as whistler continues to thrash blade affixes a muzzle to the older mans mouth
you got something in mind blade
ultra rapid detox
they use it on heroin addicts make em go cold turkey in one night
blade pulls out a pneumatic syringe plunging an ampoule of amber colored fluid into the bottle mount
gonna try and od whistler on a retroviral cure
i dont know about this man blade injects whistler with the syringe
whistler howls in pain nearly throwing blade and scud off him
to scud get back
scud scurries away
whistlers struggles have taken an even more violent turn
blade beats him back down
finally blade steps on whistlers neck pinning his head as he draws a shotgun from a holster beneath his armpit
he shoves it in whistlers snarling face
if theres anything of you left in there whistler listen up now
come morning those shutters are going up
either youll be cured or youll fry
blade raises his foot from whistlers neck quickly backing out the door
whistler throws himself at blade nearly tearing the chains from the wall as boom
blade slams the cell door closed
the door is heavy steel
nevertheless whistler kicks against it threatening to tear it off its hinges
blade throws a heavy cross bar over the door
then he steps back joining scud
whistler hammers the door again and again and again
but the crossbar holds
blade glances at scud whos looking winded and shaken by the ordeal
its going to be a long night
scud nods and exits
blade drags a chair across the floor setting it in front of the door
he sits down shotgun resting across his knees holding vigil
and off that grim stoic image we daylight bleaches the image almost whiting it out
a wino sifts through refuse collecting bottles
three mutts are tethered to his side with rope
he reaches for a bottle cuts himself on a piece of glass
as he inspects his wound his dogs growl
the wino looks up a black kid is standing atop a mountain of refuse wiry and intense perched there like a predator
the wino glances at his wrist again the blood then back up at the black kid
unnerved the wino starts to back away then turns bumping right into the black kid who has moved beside him with uncanny speed
note this all happens within a single continuous shot
the boy slams the wino against the trestle wall and snarls baring fangs
and just as hes about to tear the mans throat out a hand reaches in from off screen pulling the boy back
its whistler twenty years younger and spryer with a head full of raven black hair
whistler throws the boy into the light forcing him onto the ground
he shoves a
against the boys face and is just about to pull the trigger when he stops noticing overhead sun reflected in the boys eyes
whistler looks up and sees the sun at high noon then glances back at the boy in understanding
son of a bitch
blade wakes up lifts his head
a shaft of sunlight shines directly down onto him reflecting back at us from his now adult eyes
blade hasnt moved
he sits in the chair in front of the cell door which is now silent
he stands unlocking the cell door
he heaves the cross bar away
the door groans as he opens it
we can just make out whistlers figure huddled in the corner like some kind of caged animal his lanky gray hair obscuring his face
whistler doesnt stir
blade crosses over to the steel shutters
for the briefest moments he hesitates
then he hits the switch readying his shotgun
with a hum the shutters rise throwing a shaft of blinding sunlight over whistler
blade lowers his shotgun
whistler slowly raises his head fixing blade with a bloodshot eye
how do you feel
like a fucking heifer took a dump in my mouth
whistler stands bare chested before a corroded mirror splashing water from a sink over his face rinsing off shaving cream residue
he inspects his features hes cleaned himself up a bit trimmed his beard etc
he pulls on a fresh shirt then turns to face blade who stands behind him
you came back for me
did you think i wouldnt
took you long enough
that was as close to a thank you as this old junkyard dog is ever going to give
whistler has fired up a lucky strike
hes moving through the storage area where much of his old equipment has been shelved pulling tarps off checking things
lets just hope youve kicked the thirst for good
ill be watching you close
you start to back slide you put a bullet in my brain
wouldnt expect anything else
whistler takes a long drag expelling the smoke slowly studying the cigarette in his hand
ill say one thing for doing time as a suckhead
seems to have knocked that cancer of mine back into remission
then whistler stops obviously frustrated
where the hells my lathe
just then we hear the sound of an industrial lathe firing up
curious whistler exits into the workshop proper
scud is working at whistlers old lathe bopping his head along to music which is playing on a nearby tv
the them song to speed racer
now hes wearing a ron jeremy t shirt that says daddy
here he comes here comes speed racer
hes a demon on wheels
hes gaining on you so you better look alive
hes busy revving up the powerful mach five whistler cocks an incredulous eyebrow at blade who has fallen in beside him
scud kills the lathe and approaches
nice to meet you man
heard a lot
im josh frohmeyer
you can call me scud though
thats what most people do
scud offers his hand
whistler doesnt take it
scud shoots an uneasy glance at blade raising an eyebrow in question
is whistler okay or not
whistler moves over to the charger which has its hood up
tell me something skid scud
whatever checking the motor whatd you do to the charger
the pimp mobile
just made a few after market modifications
nitrous oxide injection system forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft higher flowing fuel pump
gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping
whole packagell crank this betty up another three hundred horsepower
cutting him off and youll burn the damn thing out before your next fucking oil change
whistler just looks to blade and shakes his head
whered you dig up this shit bird anyway
look whats your problem
whistler gets in scuds face
scud looks to blade for help but he just watches letting the two of them sort things out
my problem shitbird is that i tried to blow my fucking head off and wound up sucking blood clots for the last year and a half
now youre standing there choking your chicken like were all walking around some fucking candy ass vampire sitcom
scud attempts to show some balls but stammers all the same
hey you think i dont know whats at stake here
we practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass
and for what
grabs scuds shirt our operation
i built this operation you fucking turd stain
just then however an alarm starts beeping
scud checks a display as blade readies his mach
looks like zone three
scud checks a series of thermal signature displays
body temps fifty so ill guess suck head
scud looks to a bank of security monitors the views break into static as a figure rushes past them
he tries a few keyboard commands
i dont understand im not getting anything on the surveillance cams
whistler makes a few adjustments on the nearest monitor
whoevers out there is using magnesium flares
seems like theyve got your security system stopped out pretty well
whistler moves to a rack of weaponry
as he reaches for car scud moves to stop him
whoa whoa easy cowboy im not trusting you with a weapon just yet
whistler smacks scud in the face with the butt of the car and pushes past him
we hear a crash
running on all fours racing upside down across the ceiling at break neck speed
then they drop somersaulting down fifty feet landing in a cat like stance
hit the god lights
scud with his nose now bleeding activates a series of stadium style lights secured to the ceiling
the entire place goes white with uv light the image nearly blowing out
they are wearing metal goggles with iris shut to mere pin prick openings
whistler trains the car on who is now removing something from a satchel
the intruder drops the object and cartwheels away
in the blink of an eye the second intruder has launched himself at whistler hand springing off the floor then kicking him in the mid section
as whistler falls back the second intruder presses forward
unsheathing his sword rushing at the first intruder
the intruder traps blades forearm pivoting planting a boot in blades ribcage
obviously the intruder is a serious martial arts student
the two of them go at it unleashing a flurry of kicks blocks and punches
the intruder gets blade in a back choke
he twists out of it throwing the intruder over his shoulder who neatly cartwheels springing back off the wall at blade again blade ducks beneath one of the intruders kicks
then traps the intruders foot giving it a savage twist
blade backhands the intruder with a blow so strong that it knocks the intruder to his knees
then the intruder reaches for a short sword
in a heartbeat the sword is out and against blades throat
just as blades sword is not against the intruders
its a stalemate
blade and the first intruder freeze
the second intruder steps away from whistler whom he clearly had the drop on and tosses the car to the ground
we didnt come here to fight
we came to deliver a message
blade looks back to the first intruder
then slowly withdraws his sword
the intruder does the same
blade turns off the god lights
the uvs fade and normal lighting returns
scud and whistler pick themselves up off the floor
take off your masks
the intruders remove their masks
the first is asad a cautious sufi muslim possessing a restrained nobility
the second is a woman nyssa
something with emerald eyes and strong darkly exotic features
both are vampire
my name is asad
this is nyssa
we represent the shadow cabinet
the ruling body of vampire nation
theyre offering you a truce
they want to meet with you
wiping blood from his nose bullshit
blade holds up his hand silencing scuds outburst
he nods for nyssa and asad to continue
nyssa slowly crouches and reaches for the object she dropped a cd
she tosses it to blade
still keeping an eye on them blade slips the cd into a reader
we see a slide show of video capture shots taken from a surveillance camera
nomak tearing into the blood bank staff etc
for decades youve been the thing weve feared the most
but theres something else loose on the streets now the final still
a blurry horrific shot of nomaks half turned face and back
we get a sense of distorted inhuman physiognomy
something worse than you
blade whistler and scud stand near the ledge while asad stands a few yards off talking on a phone
nyssa stands even further away watching them with distrust
this whole deals giving me a serious case of the butt willies
look kid they obviously found your base of operations
if it was a trap why flip their dicks by announcing themselves
we play along for now we might wind up learning something about how their world ticks
grinning at scud either that or feeding the worms
asad finishes his call and approaches them
theyre ready to see you now
as if on cue we hear the thrum of helicopters
seconds later two bell jet rangers appear above them illuminating them in their searchlight
we track the helicopters across the night sky
we see whistler and asad in one blade scud and nyssa in another
blade and nyssa sit in the rear of the first helicopter
nyssa is studying blade
they tell bedtime stories about you
blade the big bad boogie man
frankly im disappointed
blade raises an eyebrow that you were willing to come along so easily i mean
without any assurances
blade smiles and opens his coat gesturing to a bandolier of plastic explosives secured to his chest
enough to level a city block
hows that for assurance
the helicopter abruptly banks right dropping down low
the bell jet rangers touch down outside a terraced frank lloyd wright structure overlooking the ocean
as nyssa and asad lead blade whistler and scud towards the facility we see a circular crimson logo encircling a double helix
scud notices a series of red light dots on his arms and chest
he looks up to see dozens of vampire marksmen on the roofs above training their weapons on them
the group rides down
the elevator stops
the doors open
nyssa and asad lead them into a hub out of which multiple corridors project
they take the central corridor
the corridor ends at a pair of steel security doors
nyssa stands before a biometric scanner allowing a beam of light to play over her face
the scanner acknowledges her identity and the doors hiss open revealing a series of security doors beyond these which successively open into oak set into a stainless steel wall
incalculably ancient elaborately carved
brought over from the old world
the house of erebus you encountered before were nothing but feudal lords
the true power of the vampire nation lies here as they move towards the final door whistler shivers
scud watches as his breath escapes from his mouth in a frosty plume
asad takes notice
few warmbloods have seen whats beyond this door
he pushes the doors open into a crescent shaped room filled with antiquities quarry columns from middle kingdom egypt stacks of arcane volumes medieval frontispieces
a borgia esque renaissance portrait staring down at us with a severe gaze
towering over all of these is a massive greek cross carved from stone
music echoes around them boitos faust
standing in the midst of this is overlord eli damaskinos wearing a robe of black silk
father damaskinos holds up his hand
he waits for the music to crescendo then turns his face still hidden in shadow
i hope you dont mind the cold
when one such as myself reaches an advanced age certain precautions are needed in order to preserve the flesh
blade this is overlord eli damaskinos
in vampire dialect subtitled welcome daywalker
i thank you for coming
ive been anxious to meet you for quite some time
damaskinos draws closer now stepping into the light
bright eyed with smile like moonlight gleaming off a knife blade
his skin is impossibly pale almost marble like with traceries of blue blood pulsing underneath
and the late abraham whistler
i trust your time amongst our numbers was agreeable
whistler glares at damaskinos
the two men stare at each other a moment sizing one another up
smiling knowingly it has been said you may have enemies whom you hate but not enemies whom you despise
be proud of your enemy then his success shall be yours too
in that regard i should thank you
eliminating deacon frost
carter stevens an officious looking familiar who has been quietly watching from the wings now steps forward
all that unseemly business with lamagra
you did us a favor
offering his hand to blade carter stevens
as blade and stevens shake blade notices a vampire glyph poking out from beneath the familiars shirt cuff
with a smile barely
im a lawyer
stevens works with the national institute of health
off blades look given that they monitor the nations blood supply a strategic alliance seemed prudent
we also finance a number of humanitarian organizations the national institute of infectious diseases for one the human genome project
blade and the others turn to nyssa who uses a complex mechanical key to activate a holo projector mounted above the table
as she focuses the image a d diorama of vampire viral nucleocapsids swirls into view
the nucelocapsids begin attacking human red blood cells
as you may know vampirism is an arbovirus one thats spread through the saliva of parasitic organisms motioning to the hologram in this case vampires are the vector
the virus replicates within the human bloodstream evolving its host into an entirely new life form
beat unfortunately viruses evolve too as nyssa talks one of the viral nucleocapsids changes mutating from its original elegant design into a harsher more menacing form
the mutated nucleocapsid begins feeding on the original vampire capsids causing a chain reaction of mutation
in seconds the holo image is filled with throbbing microscopic horrors which then mutate into weve dubbed this new virus the reaper strain
and like any good pathogen it appears to have found a carrier a patient zero
a rotating d image of jared nomaks face
eyes red his skin in full blood mode blush
his name is jared nomak
thiavolos as we used to say in greece
he was born a vampire but he is an anomaly
to blade like you
unlike the rest of us however he feeds on not just humans but vampires as well
seems like hes doing me a favor then
youre missing the point
their vampire victims dont die
they become carriers
if the reapers continue unchecked there could be thousands of them before the month is over
do the math
blade turns to damaskinos
vampire dialect subtitled you want me to hunt them for you
vampire dialect subtitled not alone
weve been training a small tactical unit the bloodpack
we want you to lead them
just how long has this little social club of yours been together
then they werent created to go after your patient zero
theyve been training to hunt you
blade whistler and scud enter through the loading elevator
blade turns to whistler
what do you think
sounds like a plan
what do you really think
lighting a cigarette these guys are shitting bricks cause theyre no longer on the top of the food chain
theyre going to fuck us the first chance they get
whistler moves away
blade shrugs off his jacket begins putting away his weapons
scud lingers apprehensive
so youre going to do this
keep your friends close and your enemies closer
isnt that how the saying goes
scud follows blades gaze watching whistler who has collapsed into a chair at the far end of the workshop
the grizzled hunter pulls off his leg brace then massages his bum knee
scud nods in whistlers direction
im worried about him
off blades look look i know hes your friend but just watch him okay
nobody goes cold turkey from the thirst in a night
surrounded by the salvaged parts and massive gears of long discarded machinery half hidden in shadow
a shaft of morning sunlight cuts in through one of the windows slowly moving across the floor towards his position
he shifts in his chair moving slightly away from the light
an ice encased streetlight hums and flickers
the pumps are vacant
a heavy blanket of sooty snow covers the grounds of the station
the fluorescents of the mini mart are the only beacon of light in an otherwise fog bound night
a korean woman s mans the counter
her toddler sits in a circular safety walker nearby
the kind that rolls and is affixed with toys to keep a baby occupied
the woman glances at two surveillance monitors
on the first monitor we see pull up to the pumps outside
a man gets out slides his credit card through the reader starts pumping gas
we see a figure standing at the back by the slurpee machine
the figure turns approaching
he sets a package of gum on the counter looks to the baby
he smiles wriggles his finger
the child coos and smiles back
unnerved by nomak the korean woman quickly rings the transaction gives him his change
he removes a stick of gum from the pack carefully unwraps it slides it into his mouth watching the child all the while
finally he nods to the woman and leaves
the door chimes as he exits
the woman looks to the surveillance monitors again
the car is still there but the man pumping gas is gone
puzzled the woman steps from behind the counter and moves to the glass doors looking out the cars driver side door hangs open
even more disturbing the hose for the gas pump lies untended on the icy ground spilling fuel from its nozzle
the korean woman cautiously exits the mini mart
no one is in sight
she hurries to the abandoned car disengaging the lock on the pump handle then setting it back in its cradle
she looks to the open drivers door
a few droplets of blood have stained the snow just outside it
then she sees standing off in the fog bound shadows
the woman looks back to the mini mart then back again to where the figure was standing
but the figure is gone
growing increasingly anxious the woman hurries back
the woman shuts the door locks it
but shes still just a target standing inside a well lit glass box
she moves to the safety walker scoops up her child
after another moments indecision she slides the accordion style gate down over the doors and windows
then she turns off the lights
feeling somewhat more secure the woman moves back around the counter and sees an unwrapped stick of gum resting on the tray of the baby walker
it wasnt there before
with a rising sense of dread the woman backs away bumping right into he smiles cruelly the scar seam in his chin just beginning to part
the woman gasps turns to run and bumps into three more reapers
gaunt and feral looking
all three with shaved heads
no eyebrows and hairline scar seams running down their chins
as one the reapers descend on her
we hear the childs terrified wail and we a sulfur colored moon shines its baleful light down upon the icy cityscape as nomaks roar echoes through the canyon of buildings
blade is just finishing injecting himself with serum
he sighs falling back into the chair hes sitting in waiting for the shakes to subside
he unwraps a piece of rubbing tubing which hed been using as a tourniquet flexes his hand
the door to his room opens
scud stands there in silhouette
um weve got company
blade emerges into the workshop proper with whistler and scud
stand before us
they represent an assortment of ages and races their one unifying characteristic being a callous almost fanatical disregard for human life
in short these guys are the most stone cold motherfuckers weve ever seen
well if it isnt snow white and the seven suckheads
their leader dieter reinhardt s is a square jawed chiseled austrian
next to reinhardt is snowman a wire albino lighthammer a massive blackfoot indian and priest a bald headed modern primitive with copious piercings and facial tattoos
rounding out the bunch is chupa a blunt featured puerto rican and verlaine a familiar looking curvaceous beauty with bee stung lips that exudes a predatory sexuality
note verlaine looks familiar because she is the twin sister of raquel the bodacious vamp played by traci lords that blade killed in the opening scene of the first film
check it out troops
the vampires laugh
asad quiets them with a look then gestures to them in turn
blade this is reinhardt
thats snowman lighthammer priest chupa and verlaine
reinhardt advances until he and blade are nose to nose
tell me something chief
can you blush
a tense beat
then blade flashes a broad smile
alright you want to play this game
blade pulls out one of his silver stakes
in response the vampires reach for their weapons
but blade merely twirls it around his fingers
then tosses it to reinhardt
youve been training two years to take me out
here i am the big bad vampire hunter
so do it
what the hell are you doing blade
were going to be working as a unit you people will be taking orders from me
spreading his hands wide so lets get it over with
ill give you a free shot reinhardt
reinhardt looks to nyssa uncomfortable
why are you looking at her for
you need permission
im giving it to you
take him cabron
blade grabs reinhardts wrist pulling the stake against his chest fixing the vampire with the deadliest of poker gazes
whats wrong reinhardt
you need a fucking manual
do it reinhardt
reinhardt tenses thrusting the stake forward but blade has already whirled out of the way trapping his hand then violently twisting it backwards
before reinhardt even knows whats happening blade swings him around into a headlock
in his free hand hes got a tiny barbed flechette
the barbs spring open like a ticks gripping mandibles as blade drives the flechette into the base of reinhardts skull
reinhardt howls in pain but blade just tightens his grip choking off reinhardts air
listen up adolph i just popped an explosive charge in the back of your head
rigged to blow if anyone tampers with it
ill be keeping the detonator on me at all times
you so much as look at me crosswise and i swear youll be macking your girlfriends pie with a fucking neck stump
reinhardt lets loose a choked grunt
blade releases him dropping the gasping austrian to the floor
no one says a word
hefting a heavy ordnance case on the table
blade and company sit on one side the bloodpack on the other
opening a case of bullets glaser safety rounds in
and mm caliber
foil capsules at the tip filled with silver nitrate grains
they pack a major kinetic energy dump
and since you suckheads dont like sunlight weve modified the entry lights with uv filters whistler flicks on the entry light
then notices that chupa isnt paying attention
the vampire is looking at snowman who is saying something in sign language
whistler picks up a massive gun with a modified c mag hundred round cylindrical mag
it has a strange electromag assembly barrel with shockwave ports running along it
this puppy here
hyper velocity railgun
spits up silver tipped iron core needles at six thousand butt humping feet per second
like this whistler fires ba bang
a sonic boom rocks the workshop shattering a number of windows and computer monitor screens as a wad of needle rushes just millimeters past chupas face embedding in the wall
the fuck you doing
getting your attention paco
well youve got it warmblood
now what the fuck are you gonna do with it
blade clears his throat and stands
if you girls are finished flirting id like to get started
blade whistler and the bloodpack are silently suiting up for war strapping on body armor securing stakes and knives clicking ammo cartridges into their various weapons
we see them lacing up combat boots checking rifle sights entry lights
blade dons one of his edta pneumatic gauntlets
whistler loads custom rounds into a shotgun
then he reaches to clip on an ammo vest
but his hands are shaking slightly and he cant seem to clip the locking mechanism together
after a beat blade reaches over and does it for whistler
like a son helping his father
a beat passes between them whistler and blade looking at one another
then whistler nods satisfied
as blade crosses towards asad and nyssa he stops by verlaine sizing her up
didnt i kill you already
cold that was my sister
blade smiles coldly
this the part where you beat your chest and vow revenge
something like that
save it for the directors cut
blade moves on stopping before nyssa
where to first
the house of pain
blade whistler and the bloodpack are gathered on a rooftop overlooking a derelict city block
rises before them a gothic revival hotel marred by graffiti scrawls and boarded up windows
theres a large neon hotel sign on the side of the building
from what we can gather the reapers hunt in packs targeting places where vampires congregate
so far theyve attacked bloodbanks safehouses underground clubs like this i dont see any traffic no vampire glyphs whistler lifts up a pair of night vision binoculars and scans the
he scans the graffiti scrawls doesnt see anything
because of your efforts weve had to re think our habits tighten our security
whistler switches to infra red
a previously unseen vampire glyph is now revealed hidden amongst the haphazard graffiti
just beneath the glyph are a pair of loading doors set flush into the concrete sidewalk
lowering binocs to blade lets put this clusterfuck in gear
reinhardt reaches for whistler stopping him
youre not going anywhere greenjeans
you wont be able to pass for us
like i give a shit
before things can escalate blade steps between them
to whistler sotto hes right
theyll smell that youre human
stay here watch our backs
bristling i dont like it
im not giving you a choice old man
whistler considers blades words then reluctantly nods
blade rejoins the vampires
you dont keep that dog of yours curbed blade
we might have to do it for you
blade pulls out the remote for the flechette in reinhardts head holding it up for view
keep pushing asshole
nyssa leads the group into a loading area
the only light is coming from a series of burning trashcans
vampire sentries crouch on the steps watching smelling nyssas group as they move past
adjacent areas are walled off with sheets of vinyl
we hear the pulsing bass heavy beat of music coming from beyond the sheeting beckoning us onward
the music is louder
neon lit corridor long steel counters line both walls displaying various surgical instruments offered as party favors
as blades scans the area we see the deadly instruments reflected in his sunglasses
nyssa looks to him
this is our world youre entering
you may see things feeding
off blades inscrutable face just remember why youre here
cryptic i havent forgotten
they reach a steel loading door emblazoned with warning signs the kind that is split horizontally one half retracting into the ceiling the other into the floor
so what are we looking for exactly
anyone who looks suspicious
on that portentous note nyssa hits a button
the hydraulic doors open on into you gotta be kidding me
a high ceilinged ballroom packed with swaying bodies
retrofitted into a trance dance hall
off to the sides people are being pierced tattooed ritually scarred
silver trays piled high with razor blades are passed through the writhing crowd
everyone looks suspicious
is under way
joel peter witkin channeled by julie taymor
a she vampire hangs from the ceiling her body supported by steel pins which have been hooked through her flesh
three pvc clad spindly figures minister to her
french kiss exchanging razor blades with their tongues
to nyssa what is it with you people and pain
we need it
sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest
off his look tattoos piercings tribal scarring because we regenerate none of its permanent
so we have to take it to the next level
to remind us were alive
the bloodpack fans out through the trancing crowd
drifting through the press of flesh
feral faces flash by us distorted by the stroboscopic lights
a she vampire latches onto him
he shoves her aside keeps scanning faces
it takes every ounce of his restraint not to cut loose
you reading me scud
a nondescript van with primer blotches is parked nearby
loud and clear b
the interior of the van has been outfitted into a mobile op center
scud sits in a cluttered nest of electronic ephermera munching on a bag of white castle hamburgers
hes watching a video feed from a camera mounted on blades gear listening to the bloodpacks chatter coming in from various audio channels
in the background hes also got barry whites love machine playing
everythings copacetic in the mystery van
how you doing whistler
whistler is atop the roof of a nearby building outfitted with a sniper rifle on a tripod
walking on sunshine toke boy
the view pans from the hotel entrance to scuds van
whistler puts down the binoculars lights a cigarette
he takes out a knife and slices open his palm
he stares at the blood his hand slowly trembling
blade works his way through the crowd
the beat is getting heavier now the crowd more energized
he briefly makes eye contact with nyssa but then shes gone again disappearing into the sea of flesh ducking past one of the vinyl sheets into a corridor beyond
chupa asad snowman and priest remain behind searching the crowd
as blade walks he notices a series of grates beneath their feet
we shift our pov and we are below blade looking up at him through the grate
we are in a blood encrusted drainage area just beneath the ballroom that slopes inward towards a large octagonal iron culvert
as we watch a section of the culvert rises a pair of red eyes peering out from the darkness within
blade follows nyssa up a narrow staircase into a corridor lined with gangrenous peeling wallpaper
some of the room doors are shut some open
clearly many are occupied
a s industrial kitchen filled with corroded equipment
reinhardt verlaine and lighthammer work their way inward searching the area
lighthammer carries massive war hammer like his namesake
reinhardt nods to verlaine who opens a walk in shining her entry light over an assortment of rusting meat hooks
blade checks more doorways catching half glimpses of flesh leather and steel
he hears sobbing moans whispers
then a distinctly human whimper catches his attention
nyssa opens a door onto an empty room
a vacant stainless steel examination table gleams in the center waiting
blade pushes open another door
we see a fearful young woman crouching in the corner of a soiled room
a corpulent vampire in a leather apron is hosing down the floor
close the fucking door buddy
blade makes eye contact with the woman
shes clearly human
the corpulent vampire is getting irate when i said close the f thunk
blade throws a sliver stake into the vampires forehead
even as the vampire turns to ash blade motions for the girl to leave and were out the hallway again nyssa turning around
what was that
poker faced nothing
we see the woman duck out the room behind him
reinhardt verlaine and lighthammer
a styrofoam cup rolls across the floor blown by a breeze
reinhardt pauses notices another walk in freezer door ajar moves in that direction
unseen behind them a door behind them slowly swings open
chupa asad snowman and priest
three shadowed figures are lurking near one of the exits skinhead types each with a hairline scar running down their chin
asad silently motions to snowman and the others indicating figures
snowman signs something back
the vampire trio starts towards them
bored to shit scud plucks a joint from behind his ear
as he fires up his woman torso lighter we hear something just outside the van
scud kills the barry white listening
then a faint skittering
um whistler you out there
more urgently whistler
still no response
scud reaches for a handgun and creeps into the front of the van
he looks out the windshield nothing
he looks left then right nothing
unnerved scud returns to the back of the van
he reaches for the handle of the rear door and abruptly jerks the door open aiming the gun out theres nothing outside the van
but then scud hears the skittering again
his eyes shift apprehensively to the floor of the van below him
as they near the end of the hall blade notices a drop down attic door in the ceiling above
he unsheathes his sword and uses the tip to unlatch the trapdoor
the counter weighted door creaks and lowers unfolding a sectioned ladder
we see darkness beyond
as blade cautiously mounts the stairs nyssas attention is drawn to a billowing piece of vinyl
a blurry figure is visible behind it
then it moves away
nyssa ducks past the vinyl
as the music reaches a crescendo asad notices more shadowy figures by another exit
and even more by a third
snowman signs to asad again more urgently this time as the first potential reaper begins to turn and we are back with scud
he ducks his head outside looking beneath the van
relieved scud shuts the rear door laughs to himself
suddenly rip down through the ceiling of the van peeling it up and back like it was tinfoil
a reaper with a bloody bandage covering his eye snarls down at us
the first skinhead figure spins towards us
its a reaper
all three of them are eyes wide with bloodlust as they leap at asad and the others
suddenly the reapers are everywhere blocking the exits ripping into their vampire victims tossing them aside like toys
vampires scream and run some taking to the walls as a means of escape some racing across the ceiling
blade stops half way up the ladder as he hears gunfire
he drops back to the floor then notices that nyssa is gone
he pushes through the vinyl curtain and finds nyssa forced back against the wall wrestling with filtered panicked theyre here
nomak who swings his head around towards blade
blade fires his mach pistol point blank into nomaks face blasting the reaper backwards but nomak is back on his feet in a split second smashing through a window onto
the fire escape beyond
blade rushes to the window looks out nomak is scaling his way straight up the neon hotel sign jumping from one letter to the next with lightning speed
a reaper explodes out from the walk in rather than the door behind them
he leaps atop reinhardt slamming him to the floor
lighthammer swings his hammer missing the reaper taking out a chunk of the wall instead
lighthammer swings and misses again taking a chunk out of the floor
verlaine empties her automatic rifle into the reaper even as the reaper turns on lighthammer catching the war hammer reapers lower jaw disengages and splits open revealing a freakishly enlarged
esophagus lined with serrated sharklike teeth
all of this takes a split second
no time for lighthammer to react as the reaper latches its grossly expanded mouth onto his throat and begins draining him before our eyes
the reaper shudders and the whites of his eyes bleed red as an ecstatic wave washes over him
his pale flesh pulsing with engorged veinwork becomes flushed turning crimson as ohmygodhesfuckingkillingmehes lighthammers face becomes increasingly pallid
his face begins caving inward shrinking as every millimeter of blood is vacuumed out of him
are popping up beneath the reapers briefly translucent skin becoming engorged and dilated
the veins continue to swell racing up his neck then branching out over his face chest and arms like an instant network of varicose veins
verlaine retreats horrified
reinhardt scurries backwards then scrambles to his feet running for his life into chaos
vampire patrons flee
the bloodpack fire unleashing a hailstorm of bullets cutting into vampires and reapers alike as blade steps out onto the icy fire escape
nomak has dislodged the h from the hotel sign
it comes hurtling towards blade who ducks back into the center of the o to avoid being hit
the h continues falling smashing down into the street near the mystery van where scud unloads his handgun into the reaper atop the van
the reaper should turn to ash but it doesnt
scud flees diving into the front of the van ducking behind the wheel
he keys the ignition wham
now the reaper is atop the hood smashing his feet through the windshield
scud screams as he slams the van into the drive and floors the pedal wk krunch
scud crashes the van against the side of a building pinning the reaper between the vans front bumper and the crumbling wall
he keeps his foot on the gas pedal grinding the vans wheels
this gambit should cut the reaper in half or at the very least fatally wound it but it only enrages it further
the reaper stretches forward across the vans crumpled hood and resumes battering away at the cracked windshield uv headlights cmon come on
scud fumbles for the headlights
they wont go on
then he notices a mess of wiring haphazardly duct taped together
he reaches for the wiring fiddling with it fuckmefuckmefuckmefuckme
the reaper nearest priest turns in his direction
we recognize her as the nurse from the bloodbank
she leaps at priest priest fires a glaser round through the she reapers head
the reaper twists in mid leap falls to the floor then picks herself up again
like scuds reaper she seems unaffected by the custom made ammo
having similarly disastrous results
the reapers are shrugging off their firepower
asad leaps snapping a reapers neck with a spinning heel kick but the reaper keeps coming
alarmed reaching for a specialized shotgun instead
the reaper continues forward moving so fast she almost seems a blur as ba boom
priest pumps his shotgun repeatedly
two projectiles fire out chained together by a length of titanium cable
the cable catches the reaper in the mid section cutting it clean in half
the upper half of the reaper falls then rights itself landing on its clawed hands
impossibly the she reaper keeps coming
she skitters towards priest on his hands like the half man from todd brownings freaks
the half reaper launches itself at priest hitting him in the chest knocking him back to the floor
priest panics as he struggles with the thing trying to fend off its claws and fangs as it locks its mouth into his arm
as scud continues to fiddle with the faulty headlight wiring the windshield finally shatters beneath the reapers pounding fists
it latches onto scuds collar and pulls him forward over the wheel even as the seam scar in its chin splits apart and the reapers enlarged maw flowers open
scud is just centimeters away from having his face being bitten off when the wires spark and the headlights come on illuminating the reaper in a wash of uv light
the effect is instantaneous
the reaper howls and lets go then promptly scud cups his ear shouting via the comm system
use your entry lights
they cant stand the uv
asad hears scuds message as he continues fending off a reapers attack
then he manages to get hold of his rifle
he flicks on the uv entry light aiming it at the reapers face
the reapers head catches fire
asad shouts to the others use your entry lights
one by one the members of the bloodpack click on the entry lights mounted atop their guns
its working the uv beams are the only thing that seems to be driving the reapers back
blade kicks open the roof access door
he hurries outside followed by nyssa who hesitates when she sees beginning to rise beyond the cityscape horizon
nomak is already at the opposite side of the building moving fast
into com link whistler
hes heading across the roof
nyssa falls back into the shadows as blade continues onward unsheathing his sword
whistlers sniper rifle and binoculars have been abandoned and were back with blade as he chases nomak across the roof
nomak abruptly stops having reached the end of the roof
the nearest neighboring rooftop is too far away and the drop from this last ledge looks unsurvivable even for someone like nomak
as blade cautiously advances nomak turns around and smiles a wolfish grin unnaturally wide
the reapers face is beginning to smoke beneath the rising suns rays
in response a polarized nictomembrane slides down over nomaks irises like something youd see on a crocodile to protect its eyes from harsh light
is the enemy of my enemy my friend or my enemy
what do you think blade
what am i to you
nomak laughs then lunges scooping up a rusty iron bar that lies nearby
he swings it at blade
blade parries and steps backward taking a blow to the head in the process then another to the side
the two of them exchange a flurry of blows back and forth until their weapons lock and they are face to face
nomaks back is to the rising sun now
his whole body is beginning to lightly smoke
both men are trembling straining against their weapons using every ounce of strength to keep the other at bay
and just when it looks like nomak is gaining the upper hand athelfiki singenia ex amato
blade pivots the flat edge of his sword upwards catching the light of the rising sun reflecting it directly into nomaks eyes
nomak screams and rears back his face catching fire
then he stumbles backwards and falls right off the ledge of the roof
blade hurries to the roofs ledge and looks down but the reaper is nowhere in sight
dumbfounded blade retreats haunted by the conviction that nomak is still alive
blade has returned to the scene of the melee
the reapers have fled leaving nyssa and the others to lick their wounds and survey the carnage
quite a few full body ash outlines marking the passing of various vampires
blade approaches nyssa
she notices his wounds
brushing off her concern ill heal
what about nomak
you didnt tell me they were immune to silver and garlic
i didnt know
does he trust this woman
we lose anybody
lighthammer and just then we hear an unearthly scream
priest being held down by chupa and snowman
hes thrashing about clutching his wounded infected arm
oh god oh god it hurts
it hurts it hurts fuck it hurts
priest lets loose an agonized scream as blade and the others gather around him
hes undergoing a horrific change taking on the gaunt vein engorged features of a proper reaper
he snarls and wails gnashing his teeth like a rabid animal
reinhardt and his team look uneasy
shaken by their teammates downward progression
how long since he was bitten
blade draws closer
already the flesh on priests chin is splitting as a seam begins to form
its already changing him reinhardt paces annoyed by priests wailing
jesus cant you get him to shut the fuck up
gravely his blood cells arent producing oxygen anymore
his own body is suffocating him
these things are like crack addicts
if they dont feed every few hours theyll feed on themselves
as if in response priest starts convulsing
his flesh tightens drawing taut around his increasingly skeletal form
his screams become unbearable twisting into a high pitched ululation thats making the bloodpacks skin crawl
somebody put him out of his misery for fucks sake
you kill him
im not killing him
asad pulls out his handgun and empties the clip into priests body but priest keeps shrieking
unnerved reinhardt unsheathes a machete decapitating priest even as the others protest
the headless body continues thrashing still making noise from its open throat
if anything it seems to be redoubling its efforts
it lurches forward jerking itself free from chupa and snowmans restraining arms
the juddering horror that used to be priest staggers to its feet
reinhardt and his men panic stumbling backwards
the headless monstrosity lunges straight at without batting an eye he draws his mach pistol briefly aiming at the on rushing creatures chest then adjusting his aim to one of
the blacked out windows above and behind it
blade shoots out the window and blazing shaft of sunlight slices down through the darkness spotlighting priest like an ant beneath a magnifying glass
the headless body is incinerated in mid step
it collapses to the floor just inches before blade
one of its blackened claws feebly grabs blades boot then grows still
you could hear the pin drop in the silence that follows every one of the bloodpack thinking some variation of there but for the grace of god go i
asad lays a hand on nyssas shoulder steadying her
blade shifts his foot causing the cinder like hand gripping his boot to crumble to dust
if this is the best you turd stains have to offer im not impressed
blade looks over to see whistler who is just entering
he moves over to him angry
chupa follows equally pissed
i thought you were supposed to be watching our backs
ran into a little reaper trouble myself
approaching hostile oh yeah
like how little
in case you hadnt noticed we lost two men while you were out farting around
poking chupa in the chest you need to ratchet those nads of yours down a few notches paco
chupa flushes with anger and flicks his knife across whistlers shoulder opening a gash
whistler goes ballistic and punches chupa in the face
a brief tussle ensues before blade and the others can separate them
as chupa is pulled away by asad he looks back at whistler
listen hillbilly you are a cunt hair away from cowboy heaven
aint no thing but a chicken wing buttercup
still suspicious where were you whistler
ill show you
whistler blade and the surviving members of the bloodpack are now gathered around the octagonal iron culvert just beneath the ballroom
whistler turns on a flashlight
we hear something moving in the darkness
the group tenses then whistlers flashlight beam reveals cowering by the culvert
one we recognize
the other vampire guard from the bloodbank now transformed
hes shrunken and emaciated pale
and although hes obviously dying he still hisses his fanged mouth snapping ineffectually at them
his arm has been trapped pinned under one of the sectional culvert coverings
it looks like hes been trying to gnaw it off in order to escape
what the hell
i found him like this
i think he was trying to crawl back into that culvert
blade looks to the culvert in question
he pulls back one of the sectioned covers
the opening is about two feet wide just large enough for a man to gain access
blade drops into the sewer line
the area is claustrophobic damp
there are torn pieces of insulation hanging from the ceiling saturated and dripping with blood
blade crouch walks further in
we hear wind
he shines his flashlight
a portion of the brick wall looks like its been clawed open
calling down everything okay
blade retreats back to the drain pipe pulling himself back up
we hold for a beat then drift up to the blood saturated strips of insulation
someone is crouched in the shadows there clinging to the ceiling upside down
its nomak red eyes shining in the darkness
we are in a previously unseen portion of damaskinos vast bedroom
an elegantly tiled pool area has been partitioned off by a series of latticed screens
in the counterpoint to this are a series of muted monitors tuned to the pulse of the world cnn msnbc c span etc
damaskinos sits in a robe finishing a meal his eyes flicking over the monitors tracking current events market fluctuations
we get the sense that the man is a true polymath
that he owes his five thousand plus years of existence to resourcefulness rather than luck
stevens enters waiting to be acknowledged
vampire dialect subtitled yes
vampire dialect subtitled theyve made contact with the reapers
vampire dialect subtitled any casualties
vampire dialect subtitled two so far
unconcerned damaskinos slices into a piece of raw meat
reverting to english an inevitability i suppose
nyssa was not among them i trust
this is a dangerous game youre playing damaskinos
any game worthy of being played is
one must be patient
in this way i have outlived my enemies
all of them
damaskinos steps beyond the screens now into the pool area and although we cant see the water from this angle we can see patterns of ruby light flickering off the
stevens follows uncomfortable
blades too volatile
youre not going to be able to keep manipulating him damaskinos steps into the steaming liquid which we now see is blood
his robe spreads out floating on the surface
you worry too much stevens
i have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted
youve already lost two of your own
how many more are you willing to sacrifice
damaskinos sinks until hes waist deep in the crimson fluid
as many as it takes
pointing do you see that jar over there
stevens looks to a shelf where a gold and crystal coptic jar rests
a human heart floats within
it contains my human heart touching a pale scar on his chest something i relinquished a long time ago
only a fool would appeal to it now
the dying reaper has now been chained inside the cell
it wheezes and moans clearly in agony
blade and nyssa stand watch
blade grips the reaper beneath its jaw turning its face towards us
nodding from the surveillance footage in the bloodbank
he was one of the guards nomak attacked
which means he turned about seventy two hours ago
so why is he dying
he doesnt appear to have any broken bones no entry wounds of any kind whats killing him
blade nicks the reapers carotid artery with a knife
clear serum oozes out no red blood cells at all
no hemoglobin left
their metabolisms are too fast
they burn out
thats why theyre having to feed so often
their systems are self destructing
if thats true what about nomak
hes been alive longer than the others
hes the carrier
shaking his head theres something driving him beyond the thirst
something were missing
as they watch the reaper shakes through its final death throes then grows still the nictomembranes over its eyes slowly sliding down
a pair of gloved hands spreads apart the reapers eyelids
in response the protective nictomembrane slides mechanically down over the pupil
they appear to have a nictating membrane here like youd see on a crocodile or camel
shields the eyes from sunlight
the hands now part the reapers mouth probing the seam in the chin then splitting the mandible apart to reveal the enlarged esophagus
the fingers push back on the gums and the pressure sensitive fangs extend even further in response
a bifurcated mandible
more developed masseter muscles and zygomatic bones around the mouth allowing for a much larger stronger bite blade nyssa and scud are gathered around the autopsy table
the rest of the crew linger further back
epidermal layers are thicker tougher nyssa begins the y incision along the chest
once again clear serum oozes out
she cracks open the thoracic cavity
ho lee shit
we see inside the abdominal cavity
a complex pinkish gray parasitic organism has taken over every organ visible
ive never seen anything like this
the reapers are as different from us as we are from you
probing the organism its almost as if the virus is re wiring their bodies creating new parasitic organs which consume the old ones
like cancer with a purpose
look at the digestive system
its been drastically simplified
and this she pulls back the lungs a calcified structure encasing a fibrous mass rests where the heart would normally be
she taps the calcified structure with a scalpel
the heart is completely encased in bone
she tries to cut into the bony shell and the scalpel snaps
scud whistles impressed
good luck getting a stake through that
blade studies the reaper corpse then looks to the bloodpack
weve got six hours till sunrise
be ready by then
what happens at sunrise
we take up the hunt again
you gotta be fucking joking
youve seen what were up against
daylights the only advantage weve got
theyll be more vulnerable then
pointedly and so will we
look i care about the humans who are dying not you got it
snarling spare me the race card oj
were not going out into the sun
its too risky
you dont have a choice
youre just going to have to protect yourselves as best you can
blade spins and leaves
nyssa watches them disappear into blades room
reinhardt and the other vampires approach her
you buying any of this chocolate elvis bullshit
nyssa just stares him down obviously conflicted
this guy doesnt know what the fuck hes doing
we already lost priest and lighthammer whos gonna be next
fuck his rules
first chance i get im chowing down on that fucking heehaw sidekick of his
snowman signs something to verlaine
what do you think asad
pointedly i dont think
i follow orders
asad looks to nyssa once more perhaps hes even concerned now
shes still staring in the direction blade left
blade sits in the shadows wrapping a piece of rubber tubing around his arm injecting himself with pneumatic syringe of serum
he shivers convulses violently then throws back his head in relief
when he does so he sees whistler standing in the doorway
they eye each other a moment as blade unwraps the tubing from his arm puts away his syringe and serum
whistler lights a cigarette then nods through a window towards nyssa and the others
you ask me you and miss muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste
i wouldnt worry about it
blade moves to walk away but whistler stops him
i am worrying
seems to me youre starting to get confused as to which side of the line youre standing on
pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy
what the hell is that supposed to mean
it means im starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you
youve been acting strange ever since i gave you the cure
reckless quick to anger beat you said it yourself whistler
those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards
whered they get their intel
whistler steps closer his voice dropping to a lethal whisper
im not the one playing stink finger with vampirella out there
blade stares back at whistler calm as a viper
youre out of line old man
the two comrades in arms stare each other down
then finally whistler backs away
quietly well see
whistler turns and strides exits
we hold on blade torn conflicted watching whistler retreat
we see a figure emerge from the shadows chupa
chupa walks the night scanning shadows
like heat vision only tinged with crimson
there are drug dealers and bottom feeding whores trolling for tricks out here beating hearts and branching arteries highlighted on their ghostly silhouettes
chupa moves to the mouth of an alley nodding to a dealer
lookin to get hooked up
what you got
as the dealer glances around to see if anyones watching horse hawaiian ice
whatever you want
chupa sniffs the air glancing at a pulsating vein on the dealers neck and smiles
well im all off the hook on that bitch
chupa steps into the alley with the dealer
so whats it gonna be
chupa is at the dealers throat before he can finish flashing his fangs shoving him backwards
then i like a little adrenaline chaser
grabs a fistful of chupas hair jerking his head back
he yanks chupa off the dealer
what do you think youre doing
trying to feed puto baboso
the dealer takes off as blade swings chupa around
they exchange a couple of blows then blade knees him in the balls twisting him around by his arm dislocating it
blade releases chupa shoving him forward
chupas broken arm dangles awkwardly
furious chupa reaches for his
with his good hand only to hear the click of another gun as its placed against the back of his head
standing behind him looking grim and determined
do it and you die
chupa considers options you heard asad
until this is over these people are our allies
oh i havent forgotten about asad
im just wondering if you have
chupa re holsters his gun then jams his dislocated arm up against the wall and resets it
he backs away
nyssa watches him leave looks to blade
hes right about one thing
we do have to survive
you dont have to hunt to do it
what are we supposed to do then
starve ourselves because we fee on others in order to live
what about that scumbag you just let off the hook
a drug dealer
how do you justify saving people like that
blade doesnt answer just moves away
you know the thirst better than any of us
youre barely managing to tread water yourself
living in a constant state of pain having to shoot up that serum of yours
thats not what i call surviving blade
off blades stony expression we the back of the workshop
scud takes a hit of weed then resumes working on one of the uv entry lights its been taken half apart and tweaked out with cables and a crystal prism
whistler is there too loading magazines
observing scud the hell are you fiddling with there
proud succinct tweaked the phosphor rod modified the collimated beam wanna concentrate the light get something like a uv laser going
shaking his head youre wasting your time already been tried
yeah but you didnt have the scudster working on it did you
back then we did not
unfazed so how long have you known blade anyway
going on twenty years now
blade doesnt talk about the old days much
blade doesnt talk about anything much
nodding to scud what about you though
scud pulls up his t shirt
his abdomen is covered in a network of horrific scars
like something youd see on the survivor of a shark attack
i was backpacking
hooked up with these two chicks who were off to see the burning man festival
we were gonna take e have ourselves a little freeball out in the desert
you know the riff dear penthouse i never thought this would happen to me but scud takes a phillip and adjust some screws on the laser
anyway halfway through our threes company marathon janet and chrissy started taking chunks out of me
woulda died too if blade hadnt shown up and staked those mamacitas a new honeyhole
shrugging things kinda fell in place after that
scud jiggles the necklace of fangs around his neck
took myself a few souvenirs though
scud triggers the modified entry light
the light pulses like a series of flash bulbs going off creating a stroboscopic effect as a wafer thin super concentrated blue beam of light slices through the shadows
scud looks to whistler and smiles
poppas got a brand new bag
beyond the shadowed skyline of monolithic buildings the night is beginning to give way to dawn
scud stands before the others
he looks bleary eyed but pleased with the nights work
the fruit of their efforts are laid on a work table before them a half dozen uv laser guns along with a collection of uv flashbang grenades and a much
bigger explosive device secured into a backpack carrier
blade picks up one of the uv lasers
he sights down the length of it
scud takes a power pack and slaps into the base of blades gun
the powerpacks have a limited charge maybe ten minutes of continuous use at most
nyssa gestures to the flashbang grenades
what are these
uv flashbang grenades with plug in phosphor sticks pointing to a backpack carrier this is for the grand finale
wired together a couple dozen of those puppies
but id be careful where you pop your load
might end up frying yourselves in the process
what about you
youre not coming
after last night
dude im a lover not a fighter
asad looks to blade
what good is all this firepower if we dont know where theyre hiding
we wont need to
theyll come to us
blade looks to nyssa who tosses reinhardt an aerosol cannister
he sprays a little then wrinkles his nose in disgust gagging
this is fucking foul
i infused them from that reapers adrenal glands
all mammals use them to mark their territory
im not spraying some gash hounds nut juice on me
trust me the reapers will key to it
if we use this well draw them out
beneath the ballroom gratings
a high angle shot looking down at the octagonal iron culvert around which blade whistler and the remainder of the bloodpack are gathered
the mechanized sectional portions of the culvert covering are grinding upward flowering open and apart like some blood and rust encrusted gateway to hell
one by one the group of hunters descend into the claustrophobic chamber
verlaine is lugs the uv bomb on her back
blade leads them to the clawed open portion of the brick wall then on through
blade leads the group along a grime encrusted line which slopes gradually downward sloshing through ankle deep run off water collected from the city above them
tendrils of mist drift about cutting their field of vision even further
here and there thin shafts of sunlight cut down through cracks in the street above requiring the vampires to cautiously circumvent them
they reach a four way intersection of tunnels
time for nyssas pheromones
blade opens a statchel
inside are a dozen distinctive aluminum atomizers
he hands them out to the others
whistler triggers a can spraying a thin mist over his face wrinkling his noses in disgust
eau de suckhead
well split into three units
first team that makes contact wins the prize
try to maintain radio silence from here on out
blade points to chupa and whistler indicating the eastern tunnel
they head off
next blade directs nyssa asad snowman and verlaine down the western tunnel
blade nods to reinhardt and starts down the northern branch
its darker here no shafts of sunlight slicing down from above
whistler turns on his uv entry light
chupa reaches out with his hand partially blocking the beam
turn it off
as the shifting patterns of light and shadow play across chupas face we see his pupils contract and dilate unnaturally large in response
we want to attract them not scare them off
yeah but you fangs can see in the dark
what am i supposed to do
chupa tosses whistler a pair of night vision goggles
and try to keep up
chupa heads into the darkness moving with uncanny speed
we intercut between the three teams now back and forth as they progress deeper into the citys bowels
blade and reinhardt trudge along
the tunnel slopes inward forming a v shaped channel where a trickle of water flows
blade notices something bobbing in the water
he nudges it with his foot and knocks it free
its a broken human tibia which twirls around then flows past their legs
a few steps later on reinhardt notices something else
he stoops into waist deep water picking up what he thinks is an isolated human rib but ends up snagging a tangled mass of hair mud and bones
whistler and chupa move side by side
chupa is anxious eyes darting about
occasionally they come upon a transection with smaller conduits leading off to the right and the left
then they reach a stooped narrower tunnel and have to move single file
suddenly a blast of light and thunderous sound explodes above them
they look up startled shit
a subway train rockets by on a track just above them pummeling them with soot and dust
unseen by them briefly illuminated by the flashing subway lights we see three reaper faces pale and haunting hanging upside down
blade and reinhardt reach a dead end where the tunnel has caved in
a berm of human bones slopes upward from the water skulls and ribs vertebrae tibias metatarsi
blade kneels inspecting them
there are gnaw marks on them
must be hundreds of these skeletons here
so i think you people may have underestimated how many reapers youre dealing with
as nyssa snowman verlaine and asad cautiously move forward nyssa gasps startled by half a dozen reapers laying on the tunnel floor before them in a stagnant pool of sewage
back with whistler and chupa whistler is in the lead
as whistler turns around chupa slams whistler in the side of the head swiping his night vision goggles off
as whistler vainly searches for his goggles
what the fuck you doing
aint nobody here but you and me chicken wing
id say this is as good a time as any to settle up
chupa moves stealthily in darkness violently kicking the older man
whistler tries to crawl away then reaches for his pheromone atomizer and locks it in the on position
as chupa continues to lay into whistler we see the atomizer roll away dispensing its contents
blade and reinhardt by the berm of human bones
filtered over comm
weve got six reapers
theyre all dead
nyssa nods to asad and verlaine
they train their uv lasers on the area where the reaper corpses were but the reaper bodies are gone
and so is snowman for that matter
where did they go
screw that where did snowman go
just then we hear a noise from above
nyssa and the others whip their uv lasers in that direction
jesus they were playing possum
a horde of reapers skitter away from the lights
close on the pheromone atomizer the spray petering out
whistler is beat to shit bleeding from his mouth
chupa reaches for his handgun whipping it out just as whistlers hands brush the damaged night vision goggles
he swings them upward
whistler has just enough time to register chupa the handgun pointed directly at him us before noticing something else just beyond chupa
clinging to the ceiling above
they drop down on chupa like a pack of rabid dogs literally tearing him in half
hearing gunfire and screams blade charges back in whistlers direction as explode apart
reapers charge towards them hitting blade in the chest driving him backwards
as blade falls his entry light swings upward illuminating
drops down atop reinhardt knocking his uv gun into the water
we see even more reapers converging in on them from the side tunnels in a cacophony of shadow and noise
verlaine nyssa and asad are firing their uv lasers
the pumping flashes of their guns throw crazy shadows in every direction
adding to the unbridled chaos of strobing light and noise
more and more reapers are swarming towards them moving towards us at an unearthly clip
nyssa and her compatriots retreat running for their lives
leaps landing on verlaines back
it grabs her head and deftly snaps her spine in half with a sickening crunch
whistler panics backing away from the sounds of the reapers slaughtering chupa
he finds his gun flicks on the uv entry light and just like that the attacking reapers have vanished
whistler whirls about sweeping the uv beam around but all he sees is darkness
then a bone chilling whisper cuts through the shadows
nomak right behind him
as whistler whips the uv gun up nomak stops it
the beam is mere millimeters from the reapers face close enough to illuminate his nightmarish features but not close enough to burn
if you survive this tell your master
my end is my beginning
in an eyeblink nomak is gone
whistler spins shining the uv this way and that
alone in the dark
blade fires his uv into a reapers torso
as the reaper incinerates blade spins firing at a second reaper firing his non uv weapon
two reapers are closing in on him
blade throws reinhardt his uv laser and unsheathes his sword
reinhardt sweeps the lethal beam over the two reapers
blade retreats back into the water calm letting the creatures comes to him
as they close in on him he slips the tip of the sword beneath the surface of the water waiting as one the reapers converge on blade
he swings his sword up from the water hacking away at them using their own momentum against them
reinhardt considers his options
he decides to run for it reinhardt
reinhardt races away abandoning blade
blade reaches for one of the uv flashbangs clipped to his harness
he pulls the pin with his teeth and shoves it into an on rushing reapers mouth as reinhardt slips on the wet concrete and bang
searing light fills the tunnel instantly incinerating the reaper
reinhardts unprotected face catches fire
he screams falling back into the water trying to douse the flames
another reaper lands atop him dragging him down as we hear gunfire and screams coming from all directions
a reaper fully on fire from the uv explosion races towards him
as blade decapitates it shouting into radio re group
asad and nyssa also retreat
nyssa pulls a pin on a uv flashbang throws it behind her
uv light fills the tunnels and blade nyssa whistler and asad abruptly find themselves back in the four way juncture knee deep in water
they quickly regroup out of breath riding adrenaline highs
forget him hes chunk style
same with snowman and verlaine
guess that perfume of yours did the trick after all
quietly a little too well id say
the others turn to look in blades direction
are staring out at them from the darkness of the eastern tunnel
then we hear a hissing sound coming from the opposite direction
blade and the others spin around are closing in on them from the west
and the north
and the south
there must be forty of them in all
we got the whole fucking partridge family here
they retreat until they are back to back each one of them covering their respective tunnel opening
lunges at them from the north
asad triggers his uv laser scorching the creature
it howls and slinks backwards
attack from the east and the west
blade and nyssa respond in kind burning their assailants in mid air
but even as they fire their uv beams weaken the flashes of light coming from their barrels pulsing less frequently
unless anybody has any bright ideas id say were about half a battery away from a reaper gang bang
the foursome are managing to keep the reapers at bay but just barely
blade motions to nyssa
give me the rest of the pheromones
nyssa reaches inside her harness handing blade the remaining atomizers
he crushes them in his fist letting the fluid within spill over his face and chest
what are you doing
the reapers become even more agitated hissing loudly pressing in on them closer and closer
blade nods his head back down the western tunnel
verlaines body is back there somewhere with the uv bomb
if you train your guns in that direction youll drive an opening in their ranks
ill run for it
when the reapers come after me you make a break for it the other way
asad studies blade with newfound respect
you wont make it
hefting his uv gun then ill die trying wont i
i dont want to hear your words
lets do this now
the foursome spin firing their uv lasers down the western tunnel
the reapers shriek falling to either side their bodies burning blade charges forward firing his dying uv laser
as he makes it past the line of reapers they start after him driven into a frenzy by the pheromones
the reapers in the northern and eastern tunnels flood after blade too leaving nyssa whistler and asad to contend with the reapers in the southern tunnel
they discharge their weapons shouldering reapers aside making a mad dash for freedom
blade runs splashing and stumbling through the water just a hairs breadth ahead of the howling reaper horde
suddenly the tunnel widens out into a larger chamber
whistler and the others fire back at the small group of reapers which have followed them rather than blade
cut off from nyssa and asad
he spots a maintenance ladder and runs for it dragging himself up the rungs
a reaper leaps up the ladder after him whistler reaches the top of the ladder but his exit is blocked by a manhole cover
whistler swings up his shotgun firing into the cover
the cover is blown upwards sending a shaft of blinding sunlight down on the reaper below him
as the reaper incinerates whistler scurries upwards to safety
blade reaches verlaines half submerged body
he tears the backpack carrier off the dead vampire and hefts it onto his shoulder charging up an elevated concrete embankment as nyssa and asad find themselves cornered
their uv lasers are shot
the reapers are closing in and were back with blade the reapers overrunning him
they pile atop one another in a frenzied effort to get to him
dozens and dozens of them
and still blade struggles upward lifting the uv cluster bomb triumphantly above his head triggering the device
the world goes white
just blinding purifying light leaving us with a retina burn image of blades silhouette surrounded by reapers
in that brief instant the reapers are frozen revealed as wraith like x ray images of bone and muscle
a blast wave of light fills the tunnel chasing its way towards nyssa and asad overtaking the reapers before them
asad throws himself at nyssa knocking her into the knee deep water shielding her body with his own
asad still burns flaring up and disintegrating from the surface on downward like a piece of liquid drenched magnesium bubbles streaming from his writing body
darkness then patterns of subtle shadow and light as our vision slowly returns
blade strikes a flare
in the sputtering aureole the aftermath is slowly revealed
blade crouches unscathed as if he were standing ground zero in the aftermath of hiroshima
scores of reaper ash outlines radiate out from him some of them flash seared into the surrounding brickwork walls like permanent shadows
blade slowly makes his way down the tunnel using the sputtering flare to guide him
as before he sees nothing but reaper ash outlines
but then blade sees bleeding and horribly burned despite asads sacrifice
blade crouches scooping her up into his arms
blade kicks open a pair of doors hurrying nyssa inside
hes carrying her limp form in his arms having wrapped her in a blanket
blade himself looks like hell warmed over covered in blood ash and grime
he rushes her towards the er navigating through a maze of patients and visitors
an er nurse approaches
sir you cant just wham
blade shoulders the er nurse aside barreling into the triage where bewildered doctors and orderlies wait
she needs a hypertransfusion
blade sets nyssa down on an operating table pulling off the blanket
shes badly burned and shes lost an enormous amount of blood
as we watch she groans revealing her fangs
aghast god in heaven
just then a policeman enters gun drawn
alright buddy step away if whap
blade slaps the cops gun away and kicks him in the chest
the cop flies backwards slams into a bank of equipment falls
a nurse screams
in a near blur blade has his mach out and pressed against the doctors forehead
do you want to die
holstering his mach then get your fucking team in gear
blade unsheathes his sword deftly drawing the edge across his wrist opening a vein
he cradles nyssas head pulling her mouth to the wound on his wrist
and as she starts to feed we pull back and the sun dips towards the horizon
the shadows of the urban landscape lengthen and darken in time lapse
blade stands beneath the showerhead turning his face up into the scalding spray rinsing the blood from his chiseled physique
crimson water circles the drain
nyssa now rests on a cot
peaceful the color having somewhat returned to her features
after a moment her eyes flutter open and she takes in her surroundings
she is in blades austere bedroom there are tatami mats a basin for water a well thumbed volume of zen koans
cuts through an icy window pane above angling down near nyssas cot
dust motes swirl about it
nyssa focuses on it
then she raises her arm and reaches towards it
closer closer just barely extending her hand into the light
her fingertips blacken and smoke yet nyssa endures the pain for another moment
finally she withdraws her hand inspecting the damage then notices blade watching her from the doorway
each day is a little life
each day is a little life
every waking and rising a little birth every fresh morning a little youth every going to rest and sleep a little death
she looks back to the sunlight wistful sits herself up
anyone else make it
i dont think so
blade enters kneeling by the edge of the cot inspecting her wounds
studiously avoiding her gaze
it wouldve been easy for you to let me die back there today but you didnt
shrugging i wouldnt read too much into it
she reaches for his face
blade stops her hand
you dont want to go there
because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends
it doesnt have to be like that
we dont have to be enemies
i was useful to damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on
now that its over all bets are off
pointedly if thats true then whyd you save me
blade stands now moving to the ice covered window troubled by the question
damned if he knows the answer
after a beat nyssa rises too keeping to the shadows
why do you hate us so much
i am a hunter
its what i do
its in my blood
well its in mine too
im a pureblood
i wasnt turned
i was born this way
just like you
am i evil because i want to survive
beat what about a wolf
what about any predator
nyssa pursues blade circling around in front of him so he has to face her again
the only difference between you and me is that i made peace with who i was a long time ago
im not ashamed of what i am
beat you havent been hunting us all these years
youve been hunting yourself
blade moves away
she reaches for his shoulder
he whirls on her angry traps her hand
she tires to pull it free but he grips her wrist tightly pulling her closer youre hurting me
pain cuts the deepest isnt that what you said
and closer their faces are just inches apart now reminds you youre alive
and blade kisses her hungrily
nyssa responds in kind
her head drops low her mouth finding the cords of his neck sucking at his flesh then sinking her teeth in deep and wham
blade clamps a hand around her throat slamming her head back
a droplet of blood dribbles from her lips as she lets loose a breathless shudder
shes in the ecstatic throes of the thirst now all reason gone
blade reaches his other hand to her shirt ripping it open as he runs his fingers across her breasts then over her exposed rib cage
he turns her around forcing her against the wall sinking his own fangs into the back of her neck
she groans as we naked on the tatami mats upon which blade sleeps
skin beaded with sweat
breath steaming in the chill air
hes atop her moving inside her with measured thrusts
nyssas limbs are wrapped around him
she claws at the expanse of his back with her fingernails
her mouth is locked on blades throat then his is locked on hers
together they drink leeching blood from one another
nyssa clutching greedily at blade like she never wants to let go
her soul is gone transported to that place we drift to when the euphoria overtake us and were somehow able to transcend the horror of our fleeting lives
finally nyssa gasps climaxing as she retracts her fangs from blade
her head rolls to the side as her pupil focused on nothing short of eternity dilate unnaturally large
blade and nyssa lie in each others arms awash in moonlight blissfully dead to the world until he sits up listening
nyssa stirs beside him
she moves to speak but blade holds up a hand silencing her
together they slowly creep towards a nearby window where is pressed up against the icy glass staring back at them
blade draws back with a start
but in the time it takes to blink nomak is gone
just then we hear a noise
scud appears in a doorway groggy
whats going on
he was here
he wants us to know hes hunting us now
blade is at the computer workstation
he activates the footage of nomak he was viewing earlier
he fast forwards to a specific moment then plays it back at normal speed
nomak said something to me before he disappeared the first time blade points to the screen saying the words as nomak silently mouths them
athelfiki singenia ex amato
at first i thought he mightve been using one of the vampire dialects
but it turns out its greek
do you know what it means
nyssa shakes her head
it means bloodbrother
i dont understand
well maybe i do
blade spins his mach pistol up and ready to fire
whistler sits on the opposite side of the room watching them as he smokes
to scud your securitys for shit kid
where the hell have you been
just out connecting a few dots
whistler rises from his chair
he flicks his cigarette butt into the shadows and fixes blade with a heavy stares
bangin some vampire chick
kind of a faux pas in our line of work wouldnt you say
hope you double bagged it at least
blade is still guarded not yet ready to lower his mach
whats your problem whistler
why dont you ask your girlfriend
blade looks to nyssa but she seems equally perplexed
i did some checking on that carter stevens character
that familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the nih
turns out he used to work for them but he doesnt anymore
then who does he work for
whistler gives nyssa a rueful stare then tosses blade a research folder
on the cover is the same red double helix logo we saw at damaskinos facility
some biotech outfit called caliban industries
theyve been lying to us since day one
this nomak fucker didnt evolve
he was designed
nyssa look to blade imploring
i dont know what hes talking about
you expect us to believe that
to blade who you going to trust blade
me or her
a high tech heavily guarded industrial complex nestled within an expanse of unassuming wooded acreage overlooking the ocean
carter stevens shuts down his computer workstation then moves to the heavy oak door glancing at a medical chart as he opens it
when he looks up you
a fist punches stevens in the face
stands in the entry way
whistler is behind him holding a gun to nyssa
scud is there too
mobing in on stevens start talking bitch
i dont know what you blade spins stevens around shoving his face against a glass case crushing the mans nose spiderwebbing the glass
you created him
blade clamps his fingers around stevens broken nose and twists it with a sickening crunch
stevens screams caving
in agony alright alright
yes we did
gasping blade releases him
stevens sinks to the floor cradling his brutalized face
keep talking stevens
tell me why
sputtering the shadow cabinet
for decades theyve been trying to find a way to rid themselves of their hereditary weaknesses
viral epidemiology immunochemistry
recombinant dna was the next logical step
genuinely horrified no thats not possible
they wouldnt keep something like this from me
your father didnt want you to know
haltingly something went wrong
the reaper strain was too aggressive
then nomak escaped
and were supposed to clean up your mess
defensive look the fact that nomak was artificially created didnt make the threat any less urgent
he was still out there spreading the reaper virus
but blades not concerned about that now
hes got something more pressing on his mind
the genetic material you spliced into nomak beat almost fearful where did you get it
i should think that would be obvious at this point
standing behind them
we took the genetic material from you
damaskinos leads them down a corridor
jared nomak is your genetic brother
and i suppose if you follow that line of reasoning to its logical conclusion then these are your offspring
damaskinos reaches to a nearby control panel pressing a button
a pair of massive doors slide apart revealing we are in a vast multitiered temperature controlled chamber equal parts st century medical facility and hammer house of horror
a network of catwalks look down upon the circular chamber the center of which is dominated by a massive steel cask which is in turn ringed by a safety railing
the operation looks not unlike a small scale water purification plant or perhaps a futuristic distillery
only in this instance the liquid churning within the cask is human blood
each no bigger than a thumbnail line the walls of the chamber preserved in credit card sized cryo cases
there are thousands of them resting atop one another in racks with stretch from the floor on upwards
as damaskinos removes an embryo from the rack we see another embryo behind it
that cryo case now slides forward with a whir taking the place of the one which damaskinos removed
like some kind of perverse vending machine
god knows how deep theyre stacked
if thousands are visible there could be tens of thousands in total
damaskinos holds the translucent cryo case up to the light
the embryo within shudders its tiny heart beating
proudly a new breed begotten from your own flesh
immune to silver even sunlight
stepping towards blade the wolves have lain with the sheep long enough
no more compromises
no more deals
we hear the tread of heavy footsteps approaching
all eyes turn towards a side corridor
enters from the shadows holding scuds rail gun
much of his face has been burnt away leaving him with a ghastly deaths head mask of blackened muscle and exposed bone
put it back in park blade
thought you were dead
seems like theres a lot of that going around these days
as reinhardt aims the rail gun at blade a dozen vampire guards appear on the catwalks above also taking aim
six thousand feet per second isnt that what whistler said
lets see you dodge this one blade does his level best pulling his mach squeezing off a shot even as reinhardt fires
blade is hit in the side spun clear around
his shot goes wild hitting one of the guards in the head turning him to ash as blade himself falls to the floor
blade gasps in shock
the rail gun needles have ripped a brutal hole through the side of his chest plate
he clutches at his flank trying to staunch the blood thats seeping between his fingers
as he sits forward we see more flechettes have embedded in the wall behind him having torn completely through him
whistler steps forward
one of the vampire sentries lashes out striking him in the face with the butt of his rifle
whistler sinks to his knees stunned
the guard disarms him
gritting his teeth against the pain
he reaches inside his combat harness pulling out the remote detonator for the explosive flechette in reinhardts skull
kiss your ass goodbye reinhardt
youre wasting your time blade
the flechettes a dud
scud crosses over to reinhardts side
whistler stares at him in disbelief
it was never supposed to explode
all it was supposed to do was make you feel like you were in control
blades eyes darken with hatred
thought you had me on a short leash didnt you chief
only it turns out youre the one thats been on the leash
reinhardt digs his claws into his scalp and tugs the barbed flechette from his skull
as he does so blades remote detonator beeps to indicate its being tempered with
reinhardt finishes removing it and sighs contentedly
reinhardt tosses the fletchette to scud who grins flipping down his lower lip to reveal a vampire glyph tattooed on it
see im one of damaskinos familiars
blade looks to nyssa who averts her gaze
yeah your little cootchie knew
you little shit
when did they get to you
back when blade had me hunting down your puckered old ass
whats up with your hair anyway
fucking willie nelson look a like
scud punches whistler in the face
man i so wanted to do that
scud shakes his hand which is smarting from the blow
he looks to blade now angry
you never cared about me
i gave you everything
all you cared about was digging up the old fuck
you think they scoped out my security system
chuckling i let them in
dude i practically gave em the fucking keys
ive been feeding damaskinos information the whole time
providing them with samples of your genetic material helping them with the reaper program
theyre close blade
right up against it
any day now theyre all going to be daywalkers
and when that happens well lets just say i dont want to be on the losing team
you may be strong you may be fast but in the end youre just too human b
he pinches blades cheek
then he stands up
so thats down and dirty
got anything to say for yourself
weak but defiant two things
one i was on to you the moment they turned you
and two raising the detonator smiling i switched that dud of yours back with the real one
scud has a split second of terrified wide eyed realization before blade pushes the button and boom
the flechette in scuds hand explodes blowing his body apart spraying those nearest him with blood
son of a bitch
as the others react with varying degrees of surprise and horror reinhardt savagely kicks blade across the face
he hits blade again and again driving him down to the floor
then he bends and tugs the sword from blades back scabbard preparing to cut his throat
nyssa takes a step towards blade but damaskinos stops her
damaskinos gestures to his guards
they haul blade up and drag him from the lab
reinhardt gestures to whistler
what about him then
crossing to whistler handcuffing him me and hobo kelly here have a little unfinished business
damaskinos waves dismissively
reinhardt takes whistler away
blade is dragged into a large autopsy room
the vampire guards lay him on a steel autopsy table
he struggles against them but hes just too weak from loss of blood
eventually they get him secured clamping his wrists and ankles into steel manacles which are affixed to the table
blades sword pommel as the booby trap blades in the handle spring out
pull back to reveal reinhardt holding blades sword
he gives it a few practiced swings then runs his thumb along the blade
how many vampires do you think hes killed with this thing
sitting in the corner his hands cuffed behind his back
we are in a security station filled with surveillance monitors offering various views of the laboratory complex
not nearly enough fritz
keep talking warmblood
reinhardt kicks whistler in the face
when im through with you youll be begging for a dirt nap
whistler spits blood and glares up at reinhardt
been dead before
didnt much cotton to it
tell you what chicken shit
you do your worst
well settle up after
nyssa stands before the banks of vampire embryos clearly troubled
damaskinos regards her
vampire dialect subtitled my child damaskinos moves in close to her running a finger along her throat
she doesnt acknowledge it
in english i would hate to think you were losing your perspective
who do you think god favors in the web
the spider or the fly
nomak said something to blade in greek
athelfiki singenia ex amato
where did he learn that
from his father of course
horrified you experimented on your own son
damaskinos slowly tightens his hand around nyssas throat
i have fathered thousands of children in centuries since i first walked this earth
make no mistake nyssa
those blood ties mean nothing to me when measured against the ascendancy of our race
giving her an extra squeeze if you have any interest in remaining alive you would do well to remember that
damaskinos releases nyssa
she falls gasping for breath
he stares down at her with disdain then exits
damaskinos enters followed by carter stevens
the guards remain posted at the main entrance of the room
damaskinos approaches looking down at blade
blade stares back at him still defiant but fighting a losing battle
hes dying and he knows it
his breathing is shallow
its an effort just to keep his eyes open
with every century humans become more repulsive to me
once you were souls to be taken corrupted
but you have disgraced yourselves to being nothing more than blood and meat
two surgeons snap on surgical gloves
stevens is enjoying seeing blade helpless
were going to harvest you blade
injecting fluid into blade bone marrow organs everything
your tissues too valuable to let go to waste
weakly nomak is still out there
true but thanks to you we know his weakness
we can keep him contained
its just a matter of time before we hunt him down
too bad youre out of it
damaskinos is amused by blades seeming lack of concern
and why is that
thats what nomak wanted all along
to pay back the people who created him
you may be right
fortunately for us he has no idea where this facility is located
blade smiles laughing tiredly
he does now
off their concerned looks hes been watching me since the tunnels
i led him right to you
blade lifts up his hand unfurling his previously closed fist
there is a deep gash in his palms
just like a trail of bread crumbs
damaskinos stares at blades hand then looks to the floor
a line of blood droplets lead back to the doors through which he entered
various hallways the helipad outside caliban industries etc
in rapid succession we see more trails of blood droplets
then just as quickly we are back with damaskinos and company
suddenly the lights above them flicker then go out
as emergency lights kick on bang
all eyes turn towards a steel security door which is shuddering bulging and bending inwards as nomak throws himself against it
damaskinos looks to a bank of security monitors which are flickering back to life now
we see nomaks blurred silhouette from various angles pummeling the door
a portion of the door is clawed open and we see a glimpse of nomaks snarling face
roaring damaskinos eyes widen in terror as he stumbles backwards activating an alarm
he looks to the guards screaming
damaskinos runs for his life rushing out the opposite door quickly followed by stevens as we nyssa hears the alarms and moves into a corridor lit by red strobing emergency
vampire guards are rushing past
reinhardt also hears the alarms
he looks to the surveillance monitors where he sees nomak
behind him we see whistler taking advantage of the distraction
he folds his legs up under him working his cuffed hands over his feet
when reinhardt spins back away from the security monitors whistler is gone
a steel grating in the floor lies half open
the obvious means of exit
as nomak continues tearing down the autopsy door bullets hammer into his back
he turns sees a dozen guards firing at him their gunfire chewing the shit out of the concrete walls around him
nomak staggers but doesnt go down as clear blood sprays from the body hits
whistler shuffles forward through the narrow conduit on his elbows
we hear footsteps
through the metal gratings above we glimpse two figures rushing past damaskinos and stevens round a corner spilling into several guards
he shoves his fellow vampires aside
get out of the way
close on a grate moving up from the floor
whistler emerges rushing to blades side
as he starts frantically releasing blade from his bonds he looks to the ravaged door nomak savages the guards flinging them into the air
a guards body hits the v gap in the door and obscures our view as whistler redoubles his efforts finally freeing blade
he helps him from the autopsy table
blade is sinking starting to fade
whistler slaps his face shaking him
come on blade
talk to me
a frazetta painting come to life
nomak atop dead guards draining the last of his victims blood
he whips his face in our direction and roars charging the door wham
the door gives way and nomak enters
to the right he sees whistler and blade exiting
to the left he sees the security monitors
damaskinos and stevens can be glimpsed in one of these monitors
nomak moves to the left
blade clutches his bleeding side staggering down the corridor towards a door marked eugenics with whistlers help
by all rights blade should be dead
but he continues on moving towards the door with determination
close on a hand twisting a safety lever on the floor
pull back to reveal stevens manually activating a series of hydraulic lock down latches
the doors of the eastern northern and western corridors are sealing lock down latches clamping down for extra security
even as the western door seals we glimpse nomak rushing towards it with inhuman speed
panicked turning towards the open elevator cab where is waiting
but even as stevens starts towards the elevator damaskinos dispassionately presses the close door button
what are you doing
stevens rushes towards the closing elevator doors but its too late
he pounds his fist against them
behind him we hear a terrible rending of metal as the western door gives
stevens looks in that direction in an eyeblink nomak is upon him slamming his hand over stevens face crushing it
as damaskinos slides a security card through a reader and punches in a code a thin spray of blood jets across his pale forearm
he looks to the elevator doors
the spray of blood is coming through the vertical door seal
the metal doors shudder violently and then the cab begins to ascend
damaskinos retreats to the far corner of the elevator breathing a sigh of relief
a pneumatic door slides open
blade and whistler enter
they are on the second level now up amongst the catwalks
below them is the churning cask of purified blood
they have almost reached the end of the catwalk when converge on the lab from two directions at once
some of the vampires spill through the door on the second level with reinhardt while others enter on the ground floor
as reinhardt takes aim at blade with the shotgun the other vampires fire
whistler is hit in the leg
he goes down crying out then grips blades arm shoving him onward gripping the guard rail for support dragging himself along
a shotgun blast hits blade grazing him but otherwise missing him
as reinhardt curses and prepares to fire again blade makes it to the end of the catwalk pitching himself out into open space
time slows to a crawl as blade tumbles downward plummeting into blade sinks from view disappearing beneath the churning slurry of crimson
a beat passes as reinhardt and his men draw closer apprehensive
then an explosion of blood gushes over reinhardt and the others
they fall backwards blinded slipping surfaces from the cask in morbidly glorious slow motion
think of sheen in the end sequence of apocalypse now only instead of a river of mud blade is covered head to toe in crimson
majestic and glistening
a primordial god
he rears back his head letting loose a triumphal roar
reinhardts men hesitate
one look at blades eyes and we can see hes tapped into a well spring of fury even he never knew he had
the man is super charged and ready for war
blade tears into the vampires unleashing a blizzard of martial arts moves
he powers a right hook into the first vampires face then pivots launching a devastating spinning back fist into the face of a second
at the same time he rips the second guards security belt from his waist twirling it around nanchadku style to blind a third guard and capture the wrist of a
some vampires fire their guns but blade is a whirlwind shifting and dodging
bullets go wild hitting circuitry exploding apart cannisters of combustible chemicals
in seconds flames are licking across the laboratory floor
blade drops causing a pair of vampires to fire their guns at one another
then blade knocks two more vampires onto their asses with a foot sweep
then hes up again
slamming the bridge of a fifth vampires nose into his brain with a palm heel strike
a snap kick an overhand elbow strike a knee stamp that shatters the vampires knee cap
an upward block a jab a cross a shin kick aimed at a vamps quadriceps
overhand punches rising punches parallel punches spinning rear elbows deep kicks on and on and on and on in an orgy of super hero violence until wham
blade cuts the last of the vampire soldiers down turning from the creatures disintegrating body to face the vampire mercenary clutches blades sword in his hand but the weapon provides
him with little sense of security given that hes just seen a dozen of his men slaughtered
the automatic sprinkler system is on now spraying water down upon blade and reinhardt alike
reinhardts been cornered
theres nowhere else for him to run
refusing to be cowed reinhardt screams and brings the sword down at blades head when whoosh but blade swings his hands upward slapping them on either side of the blade
trapping the sword on its downward arc
reinhardt strains trying to tear the sword away from blades grip
the vampires eyes widen in fear
and during that split second in which the two men are frozen connected by the weapon which vibrates between them blade says tell me something chief
can you blush
the sword twists free from reinhardts grasp spinning upward into the air
reinhardt stumbles backwards against the blood cask railing as blade catches the sword on its way down swinging it around in one fluid motion slicing reinhardts torso in half along
with a diagonal axis
reinhardt sinks to his knees as the two halves split apart turning to ash before they hit floor
blade stands beneath the spray of the overhead sprinklers rinsing the blood from his body
he turns towards the exit sword in hand
a set of elevator doors open disgorging damaskinos
beyond the lobby windows we can see a waiting helicopter vampire soldiers readying it for take off
damaskinos rushes across the lobby and is almost at the exit when chunk
a series of steel shutters slam down over the doors and windows
damaskinos tries to tug one of the shutters upwards then moves to a keypad nearby
he starts hurriedly tapping in a numeric sequence when we hear i overrode the security codes
damaskinos spins around
nyssa stands behind him
shes got whistlers rail gun in her hands
were locked in
are you insane
hell kill us both
maybe its better that way
as if in response a grinding shudder comes from the elevator doors
damaskinos spins in wide eyed horror then whats it going to be damaskinos
the devil you know enters the lobby from a mezzanine above sword in hand
or the devil you dont
damaskinos turns back to his daughter making a last appeal
vampire dialect subtitled for gods sake nyssa
let us out of here
nomak pounds away
the elevator doors are starting to buckle then they tear apart completely bursts into the lobby roaring
if anything he is even more animalistic now his features having become grossly distorted
in vampire dialect why are you frightened father
the prodigal son has returned
damaskinos scurries backwards but theres nowhere left to run
nomak descends on him lifting the vampire into a rib crushing embrace chomping his elongated canines into damaskinos throat
damaskinos squeals like a child as his life blood is sucked out of him
his body begins to cave inward shrinking and twisting until theres nothing left but shriveled husk
nyssa hefts the rail gun and fires at nomaks back
nomak howls releasing damaskinos body then turns focusing his blood drunk gaze on nomak
alarmed get out of here
but nyssa stands her ground rachetting back the slide on the rail gun readying to unleash another barrage of needles
nomak charges moving at unbelievable speed
she fires again aiming at nomaks chest but then nomak is upon her
he slaps the rail gun from her hands smashing it to pieces
then he wraps his hand around her throat pulling her forward sinking his teeth into her neck
as he leaps from the mezzanine level sword extended like beowulf diving to slay grendel
he plunges the sword deep into nomaks upper torso
then drives it in even further nomak releases nyssa and back hands blade across the face sending him sailing through the air
he lands skids across the floor stumbling backwards into the wall
the sword has sunk so deep that the tip is actually protruding out his back scraping a gash across the wall as nomak slides towards the floor
nomak grunts then reaches for the pomeel with his ruined hand
he grips the pommel and snaps the sword blade in half
then he slams against the wall forcing the half of the broken blade thats still embedded in him out back through the front of his chest
as nomak rises to his feet blade is on him again snap kicking the reaper in the chest
blade somersaults out of the way then springs back again kicking nomak in the face breaking nomaks neck
nomaks head lolls unnaturally sideways for a heartbeat and then nomak swings his head around somehow righting his neck vertebrae with a snap of his head
they trade blows a brutal death match that seems to defy gravity
blade moves in for a round house punch but nomak catches his fist holding it for a split second then bending blades hand at an unnatural angle snapping his wrist
the pain is enormous
nomak starts beating the living shit out of blade pummeling him with his fists gripped by an uncontrollable rage
he smashes blade against a marble column cracking it
then he flings blade against one of the brushed steel walls so hard that blades body actually leaves an indentation
before blade can recover nomak is in front of him launching another kick
blade rolls his head out of the way barely avoiding nomaks boot heel which dents the wall
nomak kicks a second time
blade avoids nomak but third times the charm and nomak lands one squarely in blades gut
blade falls beneath a flurry of blows unable to defend himself any longer
blood stains his eyes obscuring his vision
he strikes out blindly but nomak has forced him to the ground pinning him there
as blade struggles to free himself lowers his head towards blades face
the scar seam in nomaks chin splits open and nomaks lower jaw flares apart distending and widening to reveal the awful glistening hell maw the hollow inner fangs and striated
cartilage which are closing about blades face
blade twists his head violently to the right then glimpses the broken tip of his sword resting a few feet away
he reaches for it in desperation plunging it up into nomaks chest
because the hilt has been broken off blade is forced to grip the cutting edge of the weapon with his bare hands
it slices into his fingers but blade just grips the broken sword tighter ignoring the pain driving it deeper and deeper until suddenly it penetrates the cartilaginous shell around nomaks
heart and in vampire dialect blood brother
nomak smiles covering blades hands with his own
he looks blade in the eye then drives the broken sword home
nomaks body stiffens his eyes grow unseeing an oddly serene look spreading across his tortured face
a patch of blackness begins radiating outward from his chest moving over his body carbonizing him from within
as his blackened flesh begins to crack blue flames flicker out from the fissures
in seconds nomak is gone
blade stands exhausted
then he looks to where nyssa rests
he moves to her side kneeling beside her
she smiles up at him bravely but frightened all the same
blade inspects the wound on her neck
its clearly fatal
how does it look
with genuine sadness not good
blade has only confirmed her existing fears
it wont be long now
i can already feel it burning inside me she grips blades arm her eyes welling with tears
i dont want to become what nomak was beat straining i cant
i want to die while im still vampire
the burden is all to familiar to him
what do you want me to do
i want to see the sun rise
his face a mask of sad resignation
he lifts nyssa into his arms
she closes her eyes resting her head on his chest
the shutters over the doors and windows slowly rise
blade shoulders open the front door moving across the lawn towards a bluff overlooking the ocean
a moment later whistler emerges into the light watching as blade sets nysa down on the grass
her eyes flutter open and she looks into where the faintest glimmer of pre dawn light brightens the cloud swept sky
we can hear the surf crashing on the shore below
together they wait
a glimmer of light emerges over the earths curvature spreading its dazzling radiance out across the skyline
nyssas eyes widen in expectation her breath catching
she looks up at blade stroking his face smiling
each day is a little life
blade nods hes strong for her
despite his best efforts a tear slides down his cheek
they kiss then as the sun rises in full glory flooding the world with its brilliance
blade holds nyssa tightly to his chest refusing to relinquish his grip as her body catches fire
the end is blessedly quick not a slow burn of blazing agony but a nearly seamless transition from life to ash
nyssa collapses apart in blades arms billowing out around him in a cloud of glowing embers
one moment shes there the next shes gone
blade remains where he is kneeling on the bluff the wind carrying the last traces of nyssa aloft into the sky
he shuts his eyes
turns his face to the warmth of the sun surrendering himself to acceptance
isolating blade alone on the windswept bluff
after a moment whistler moves to blades side
he rests a hand on blades shoulder but doesnt say a word
we keep moving up and up until the two of them are just a pair of tiny figures on the rolling coastline
then we images of a weapon being forged all filtered through shimmering convection waves of intense heat
we see a hammer clanging down
the fires of a roaring furnace
sparks showering up from titanium slowly being given shape
and then we pull back to reveal blade works before a forge by moonlight his body dripping with sweat
he slips his hand in a protective glove and grips the red hot weapon dousing it in a quench bucket
as a cloud of steam envelops blade he lifts it up for view
wrought from titanium plated in sliver
as blade inspects the sword we hear his earlier words again i am a hunter
its what i do
its in my blood
satisfied with his work blade smiles a shit hole porno emporium offering the latest in bagged for your pleasure euro raunch
rush the vampire brother wanna be from the opening of the film is up at the register exchanging a twenty for a handful of tokens
hes humming along to that old e rotic song voulez vous couchez avec moi
yelling for your tender touch you can never get enough we follow him down a hall lined with video booths serenaded all the while by the cheesy synth soundtracks and
faked orgasmogroans coming from beyond the doors
cover me with your love rush stops at buddy booth no
hot one on one action

theres a chair set in front of a plexiglas window an intercom with a phone receiver box of kleenex and a slot for the tokens
rush gets himself situated picks up the receiver then eagerly pops some tokens in the slot

with a hum the screen in front of the window rises offering us a view of the booth on the other side of the plexiglas
only instead of a skanked out booth girl rush finds himself staring in open mouthed astonishment at who flashes an evil smile at us
you think i forgot about you
