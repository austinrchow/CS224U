zombie revised we see a little girl dancing around in a grainy super home movie
a little boy wearing a monster mask enters the frame
he struggles to lift a double barrel shotgun
he points it at the girl and pretends to shoot
whispering slowly once i had a cat he was the sweetest little guy
then one day he got sick and died
my heart was broken
my whole body hurt
she continues dancing
the little boy imitates her
after that i saw things differently everything could be summed up with three simple words
fuck the world
the camera swings over to some ugly toothless relations watching the show
we open on a dark lonely stretch of two lane blacktop
off to the side of the road we see a rundown gas station
hey welcome back to
wjrcs halloween monster weekend
im jimmy ray and ill be bringing you the oldies the goldies and sometimes the moldies
the good the bad and the uglies straight from the wjrc vaults
a weathered wooden sign proclaims captain spauldings world of monsters and madmen sits atop the building
a smaller sign below reads fried chicken and gasoline
hey kids still trying to decide on the right costume
well why not head on down to randalls penny save located on kimball rd
just off route in mackin county
choose from a wide array of ghosts and ghouls jeepers and creepers
scary sound effects everything you need for your halloween needs
sheriff huston a tall southern good old boy leans against his dusty cruiser smoking a cigarette pumping gas into his tank
inside is a poormans ripleys believe it or not
bizarre props and treasures of killers and monsters cover the dirty walls
wax figures of jack the ripper stand guard before oil paintings by john wayne gacy
alright lets get back to our monster music marathon with this classic called the teddy bears picnic
perched on a stool behind the counter sits captain spaulding a crusty looking old man in a filthy clown suit and smeared make up
the word love is tattooed across his right knuckles and hate is tattooed across the left
he is reading the newspaper crunching on crackers from a paper bag and halfheartedly listening to a small nerdy man wearing coke bottle glasses named stucky
stucky thumbs through a stack of autographed x photographs
speaking through voicebox in his throat i
i got back a stack today
some nice shots
holds up a picture of june wilkinson see a good topless june wilkinson
unfortunately she personalized it
looking at the photo to stucky love june
shit this aint worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it
i was a fixin on trading it to jackie cobb
the retard over at mollys fruit stand
yeah hes all hot on her after he found some of his dads old nudie books hidden in the basement
he keeps em taped inside his school workbook
spaulding brushes cracker crumbs off his paper and continues reading
that kid is one horny retard
christ aint they all
all them retards wanna do is fuck and eat
i think that if you knew him
i mean if youd understand his urges shit the guys like forty or something
worse than a fucking rabid baboon
yeah i guess you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes
yeah doesnt hurt himself just spins it around next to his eyeball
im sure that aint the only place hes sticking those pencils
naw he dont do anything else with em but he did get caught once with a planet of the apes doll hanging out his asshole
had to take him to the hospital
kid had dr
zaius stuck half way up his butt couldnt get it out
i always loved that mute broad that chuck heston was shacking up with
nova yeah she looked pretty sweet
yeah now theres the perfect woman
can i get some stamps off ya
slapping down his money did you fix the toilet yet
opens a drawer and tears off five stamps
yes i did
so dont you go stuffin any goddamn paper towels down that hole
i just snaked the shit out of that thing
spaulding slides the key attached to a cow skull across the counter
stucky grabs it
spaulding hangs on
ya hear me
you bust that crapper and ill beat your ass
i hear ya
he lets go of the key
from a strangers pov we watch through the window stucky exit for the restroom
sheriff huston finishes pumping his gas gets in his cruiser and drives off
lets go shopping
from this pov we race across the highway towards the front door of the museum
we burst through the door
the moment of impact
the door smashes open
spauldings head jerks up to see a masked gunman karl wearing a leather s m mask
behind him stands a second gunman rich wearing a rubber mary fucking moses
get the fuck out of here
hold it clowney
keep your paws where i can see em
yeah dont move or ill blast a hole the size of a kansas city melon through your ugly ass bozo face
spaulding obeys and raises his hands
go get that other asshole out of the shitter and drag his ass back in here
miserable little cunts with guns
i ought to jump right over this counter and bash your fucking balls in
killer karl steps up and puts his gun against spauldings face
alright tippy hand over the cash box and i might leave your brains inside your skull
spaulding smiles wide his teeth are yellow and rotted
spauldings foot kicks a red switch triggering a silent alarm
thats what you bitches need
a reality check courtesy of my boot in your ass
thatll be a fucking cash box you can cry to mamma about
a silent red light flashes
in the dim glow we see ravelli a large hunched figure sitting on the edge of a bed
the figure is heavily bandaged
ravelli reacts to the flashing light he rises and puts a huge mask over his head
he exits the room
stucky sits on the toilet pasting stamps on large yellow envelopes
killer rich kicks open the stall grabs stucky by the neck and pulls him out
come on fatboy
we move around the outside of the building watching the scene inside unfold
heavy breathing is heard
rich drags stucky into the main room
karl grows increasingly hostile knocks a candy display over raises his gun over his head and fires into the ceiling
screaming thats it
im gonna count to ten and youre gonna hand over the cash or im gonna splatter your grease paint mug across the stateline
fuck your mother
fuck your sister
come on man
just shoot him
recognizing richs voice hey i know you
we were in high school together
wood shop right
he looks nervously at stucky
shut up shut up shut up
fuck your grandmother
yeah i remember mr
alacard the shop teacher useta call you little dick wick
hey wasnt there a song we made up to go with that
temper rising shut up
singing little dick wick play with his prick dont his smell just make you sick
from ravellis pov we watch through the window as everybody inside starts shouting at each other
suddenly rich shoots stucky
stucky falls backwards against the wall screaming in pain
we move quickly towards the entrance
ravelli smashes through the front door knocking karl to the ground
in the light we see that ravelli is wearing an oversized clown head
in his hand is a sledgehammer
rich turns toward the commotion
the captain quickly whips out a gun and fires
rich falls dead
ravelli lunges at karl smashing him over the head with the hammer
ravellis clown head comes loose and falls to the floor
we now see that ravelli is a bald pitbull of a man with badly scarred skin that is painted white and red
karl hits the floor and begins convulsing violently
spaulding steps down from behind the counter puts his foot on karls throat and points his pistol at karls head
and most of all
spaulding shoots karl in the head
the screen explodes red then turns black
god damn it that motherfucker got blood all over my best clown suit
strange paintings of demons monsters and bizarre creatures fade up and move across the screen
we see a billboard painted on the side of an abandoned truck
the sign reads god is dead
we turn to face the road as a car drives by
alright then out of all of charlies chicks who do you think is the hottest
fast food wrappers and road maps clutter the cars dashboard a swinging monkey head dangles from the rear view mirror
behind the wheel the driver bill hudley downs the last sip of coffee before crumpling the paper cup and placing it among the other trash before him
i guess if i had to choose id say
she seemed like a nice girl i mean in a psycho kind of way
beside him rides jerry gilmore slumped down in his seat reading a magazine with a flashlight feet hanging out the window
huh i thought for sure youd say lynette fromme
shes got that snooty vibe i know you dig
no way she aint that hot
shes pretty cute
yeah but she reminds me of this chick that i remember from fourth grade
shit what did we call her
thinks for second oh yeah patty pee pee pants
when ever she got called on by miss chumski this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling
laughing there always one kid with no bodily controls
we had this dude jeff baxter he was a puker

better than pissing

ruth ann moorehouse
oh yeah i forgot about her

i thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution
ill let it slide she was only seventeen
dude talk about baggage that aint no carry on shit thats some heavy duty samsonite shit
yeah i guess

a lone figure in a cheap skull mask and white robe stands hidden behind a billboard off to the side of the road

the car pulls up to one of the gas pumps
bill and jerry get out

a dark haired girl denise willis sleeps curled up under a blanket

denise shakes a lump of jackets and sweaters lying next to her
she removes a sweater from the top of the pile to reveal the face of mary knowles

sarcastic and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin can mona lisa
exhales deeply i gotta pee anyway
grainy super footage shows us an old man standing in front of a small shack
his name is lewis dover
the shack is painted white and covered with simplistic religious writings
i aint no rich man but i see the truth
you do not have to go to hell
you are in hell
this is hell
all american hell
holds up a gun true heaven in my hands
im gonna blow satan back through the door to hell
surrounding the shack are strange sculptures of various half human half animal creations
spaulding swabs up the last remains of blood from the floor he drops the mop into a bucket filled with water and blood
bill pays no attention he is distracted by a strange object in a glass case over the counter
in the case is a shriveled up looking half human and half fish figure
it is the size of a small child
a banner above reads how long have you been running this place
how long is a piece of string
too god damn long thats how long
spaulding slides the mop and bucket behind the counter
shit i dont remember exactly
i took over for my pa just after the duke nabbed the oscar
yeah my pa wasnt right in the head after that
you mean john wayne
hell boy there some other duke you know about
rolls up his sleeve to reveal a john wayne tattoo a great american

jerry overhears bills and spauldings conversation and joins in to help
youd be surprised
would it be ok if we took some pictures and included this place in our book
hey knock yourself silly
you got some really rare stuff here
pointing to aqualina dig your feegee mermaid
the restroom is gray dingy a single exposed light bulb hangs from the ceiling
the peeling walls are plastered with newspaper clippings and faded photos
mary is in the stall sitting on the toilet staring straight ahead at a poster of rhondo hatton a b movie actor that suffered from acromegalia
denise standing at a tiny sink splashes water on her face
she looks at herself in the mirror
water running down her face i swear ive aged five years since this trip started
tell me about it
takes a paper towel and wipes her face god i hate falling asleep in the afternoon
now ill be up all night
stretches ugh my back is killing me
yeah hey how far do you think we are from your dads
mary flushes the toilet and exits the stall
i dont know
couple hours i think
ive got to call him
mary washes her hands
denise ties up her hair
it will be nice to have a few days off to regenerate
this trip is fun but its starting to get brutal
yeah i hit burn out mode back at that old stripper ladys place
watching her dance around with those ratty looking animals was ridiculous
i know that was some crazy shit
i never in a million years would have believed it if i hadnt seen it
a decent meal every once in a while wouldnt hurt either this road food is crap
if i never eat at another waffle house again i can die a happy girl
scattered smothered and covered
well i guess a couple more photos wont kill me
jerry knees over a box of magazines labeled true crime
he flips through an issue tosses it back
bill leans against the wall next to him sipping a hot cup of coffee
the girls return from the bathroom
jerry jumps up with excitement
great youre back
we already paid for the tickets
tickets for what
this isnt everything

aw come on

bill grabs mary by the hand and kisses it

bill and mary kiss
spaulding waits unamused
he rolls his eyes
anytime this year people
alright line your asses up in front of the black door
the tour is about to begin
spaulding disappears through a curtain behind the counter
the kids wait
the black metal door creaks open
they enter the darkened room
a blue light comes on
spaulding is standing on a motorized platform
he begins the tour speaking through a small megaphone
ladies and gentlemen you are about to enter a world of darkness
a world where life and death are meaningless and pain is god
pointing with a cane to your left you see the infamous albert fish
a lifeless wax figure pops forward with a loud metal clang
mary jumps back with fright
sadist masochist child killer and most of all importantly cannibal
born in mr
fish enjoyed burning himself with hot pokers spankings with nail studded paddles and embedding needles in his groin
on the right notice the x ray
showing clearly sewing needles inserted in to his groin
fish was executed in at the age of
spaulding rolls backwards and continues the tour
close up on a dummy face of a grizzly looking old man in hunting attire
to your right
one of our most popular crazies the psycho of plainfield ed gein
behind the figure of gein hangs an inverted corpse of a slain woman
mary recoils in disgust
murderer cannibal and mommas little bitch boy
gein found special pleasure in playing with the dead bodies of women especially their sexual organs
he was quite a handy little dandy fashioning lamp shades jewelry and human skin suits from his victims
gein was discovered when the decapitated body of bernice worden was found gutted like a deer hanging in his barn
a wax figure of a young man in doctors scrubs
he is covered in blood
and now i would like to introduce a local hero s
quentin quale a
the butcher boy a
nurse nellie and most famously a
another wax figure of a bloody corpse jumps up
murderer torturer and most of all master surgeon
quale an intern at willows state mental hospital nicknamed weeping willows for its neverending cries of pain took great pleasure in control
through primitive brain surgery
quale believed he could create a race of superhumans from the mentally ill or so the story goes
his terrifying experiments continued until
jerry stares fascinated
at which time he was discovered and turned over to authorities for observation
quale was abducted from his cell by members of the victims families
vigilante justice prevailed and dr
satan was taken out and hanged
the next day his body was found to be missing
some say he survived rescued by his loyal slaves others say they hung the wrong man
to this day no sign of dr
satan has ever been discovered
but who knows
maybe he lives next door to you
klunk a big metal door opens to the outside world
please exit through the door
the kids exit
the door shuts
denise leans against the glass walls of the phone booth
various flyers are taped to the inside free kittens phone sex ads and a missing poster for a girl named karen murphy
a light rain begins to fall
denise puts some change in the phone and dials a number
the camera moves down a quaint quiet little street
we come to rest at a modest two story house
the house is decorated for halloween
parents and their children roam from house to house trick or treating
we hear the sound of a phone ringing
a grey haired man sits at a small table eating a ham sandwich and drinking a beer
this is donald willis denises father
he stands up and walks to the phone hanging on the wall
brightens up hey denise
what whats wrong did you break down
no nothing like that
yeah were gonna be a little late
we stopped for gas at this place called capt
spauldings outside of ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing so were kind of behind schedule
oh yeah yeah ive driven by that place before
i seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place
yeah well hes still here
i think him and jerry are fast becoming buddies you know jerry
yeah hes gotta see everything
yeah i know
thinks theres some unsolved mystery around every corner
well dont take too long the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix
i know i know i forgot to mention that halloween falls on a school night so theyre trick or treating tonight
i got the joint decked out this year built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid
hopefully i can move things along here and make up the lost time by speeding all the way home
yes dad im kidding
well just promise me youll be careful
alright alright see ya soon
bill jerry and mary wait for denise
im gonna go ask him
aw come on jerry
weve gotten all were gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain
shit it is only sprinkling and its worth the trouble
hold on for two seconds
jerry goes back inside
jerry knocks on the glass as he passes
denise waves as he walks by
ok expect us more around eleven or so
ok yeah i will
love you too bye
she hangs up the phone opens the doors and heads back to the car
i know its hard to understand but i really want to see this tree
ok alright ill draw you a map but i still say it is a waste of time
through the window we see jerry talking to spaulding
spaulding draws a map explaining as he draws
geez he never gets tired does he
i swear to god he never sleeps he goes to bed after me wakes up before me
hes always working on
maybe hes a cyborg
wearily sips his coffee i like sleep
here he comes
jerry comes bouncing out towards the car and jumps in
he is holding a map and a box of chicken
we hit the jackpot
lets roll good buddy
we got ourselves a convoy
ugh whats that smell
holds up a drumstick anybody want some
no one responds
an old farmer and his wife stare directly into the camera
i dont know where that skunk ape sleeps
maybe in the trees and all
all i know is he eats squirrels to survive and he had impure relations with my wife
he performed lurid acts upon me and my person while my husband russell was a fixn to our hound clarence
if i see that thing again
im a gonna kill that skunk ape
off screen what does it look like
it looked just like that chubby fella from mchales navy
hold up the picture
the wife holds up a pencil sketch of a bigfoot like creature and a newspaper photo of ernest borgnine
bills car moves past empty farmlands
a heavier rain is now falling
jerry directs bill from spauldings hand drawn map
keep straight on this road here
how much further
im not exactly sure
it looks close
did we pass an abandoned school bus yet
i dont know
mary and denise sit bundled up in blankets
lets just skip it
it is probably nothing anyway
aw christ jerry
we cant see anything now its too dark
lets forget it
come on we need something like this
it could be the real deal
its too far out of the way to come back to
through the windshield we see a lone figure hitch hiking by the side of the road
it is a girl baby in a worn cowboy hat and long fur coat
she is soaked to the bone
its a hitchhiker
way out here
well dont even think about playing the good samaritan theres way too many psychos wandering loose these days
looking closer its a girl
hey maybe she knows where this is
sarcastically that seems likely
should we stop
we cant leave her out here in the rain
maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area
she looks like a freak
stick her in the front if you want to pick her up so bad
she looks like she stinks
imitating mary she looks like she stinks
makes cat noises cat fight cat fight
hardy har har
the car pulls over and baby jumps in
the car moves off
once inside the car they see that the girl is a bit odd
whoa thanks for stopping
i been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years
really thats a long time
yeah most people just whiz on by like i was invisible or something
or else theyre creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty naughty
this one guy stops and i look in and hes got his thing out waving it around like a drunk monkey
well hitchhiking aint the safest way for a girl to travel
yeah but its fun
sounds like a magical trip through the heartland
where ya headed
aw i was going home to my mammas house
yeah i was out doing this thing
couple more miles up this road
hey you might know

but you cant find it without me
outsider cant find no deadwood
deadwood is that what its called

hey you know what word i hate

i always hate saying the word cheese every time you get your picture taken

i know i hate swiss cheese the holes make me nervous
what about the tree
oh yeah the tree
this is crazy
she dont know nothing
baby turns her attention toward mary
oh i know
ill show you where its at sweetie
arent you just so cute all bundled up like a cinnamon roll of christmas love
go straight up about another mile
til we hit cherrypicker road and turn right
it aint far from there
the camera floats through the hallways of the peabody mental institution
it is halloween
patients wander the stark halls dressed in hospital gowns and cheap plastic masks
some are laughing some are screaming
we move into a private room
where we see doctor satan completely covered except for his eyes hovering over a bound we move off the doctor to a crayon childs drawing of a jack o lantern
tortured screams fill the room
from a strangers pov we see the car struggling down a dirt road
everyone rides in silence music plays on the radio
the song ends and a news reporter comes on
this is wjrc news at the top of the hour
investigators in clairemont county are no closer to identifying the body of a young woman found crucified to the doors of st
marys church yesterday morning
baby lights up a cigarette and takes a drag
excuse me could you not smoke in here
baby puts out the cigarette on the back of her hand
local police and state officials have released this report
i dont know
looks like some kind of animal
bill stops the car
sitting dead center in the middle of the road is a humongous dog
the dog stares straight ahead
long strands of drool hang from its mouth to the ground
why are we stopping
theres a dog in the road
honk at him
honking horn he wont move
go around him
theres not enough room
then run him over hell move
hes one of gods creatures he cant help it if hes dumb
im just crazy about animals
to denise the animals have got nothing to do with it
a gun barrel is raised and we are looking through the sight at the car
the gun fires three shots at the cars rear tire
the stranger whistles and the dog moves to the side of the road
the sound of the heavy rain masks the gunshots
hey he moved
lets get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something
as the car moves past denise stares at the dog sitting calmly to the side of the road
the dog blankly stares back at her
that reminds me of a film i saw once of a guy who got out of his car at lion country safari to take a picture of a lion cub
and got eaten by the lions
oh yeah i heard about that
i always thought it was bullshit
yeah they ripped him to pieces while his family watched from the car
the wife is screaming the kids are crying
some dude in another car filmed the whole thing
id like to see that
the lions were totally covered in this guys blood
i think they ate his face off tore open his rib cage pulled his legs off
it was a wild scene
things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think
without warning the car lunges to one side
what was that
i think we blew a tire
dont even say it

god damn it i knew this witch hunt was fucking bullshit
ok lets relax
ill check it maybe im wrong

bill and jerry stare down at the blown tire sunk in the mud

i think i took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back
jesus christ jerry
well technically i did what ya said

bill stares at jerry in disbelief
baby is leaning on her chin staring at mary and denise
the car radio plays in the background

i was just wondering

a couple of queers
do you believe this fucking girl
turning her attention to mary i was just wondering cause you got a pissy look about you
like a real pussy licking bitch
denise tries to quickly defuse the situation
no pussy licking here but thanks for your concern
bill and jerry slide back into the car
well i got some bad news and some bad news
fake scottish accent tires fucking gone crap on us man

and the spare is safely sitting in jerrys garage
for fucking sake jerry what the fuck are we gonna do
baby starts laughing
what the hell are you laughing about
i just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching tv
muttering to herself fucking psycho
i guess ill try to back it out on the rim
at least to the main road
if you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate
just back up
i think we should go straight
i mean we know for a fact there aint nothing back that way right
i love this song
baby reaches over and turns up the volume
she loudly sings along with the song
ill go straight
over the loud music fine
ill go straight
the car moves forward
after about fifty yards the car hits something hard and gets stuck in a deep mud bog
we are fucked
turn that fucking radio off
bill shuts off the radio
now what are we gonna do
we can walk to my house from here
my brothers got a tow truck he can come get your car
a silence falls over the car
i think im going fucking crazy

baby jumps up and gets out of the car
dont worry ill be right back
dont forget the flashlight its pretty dark out there
bill kisses mary good bye and exits
mary watches baby and bill head off into the woods
baby turns and makes a kissy face at mary
a hand painted tin sign surrounded by flashing lights which reads miss bunnys hollywood revue hangs over the entrance to a small garage
movie star portraits of jean harlow w
fields and clark gable adorn the walls of the garage
an over the hill ex glamour girl miss bunny comes into frame
shes dressed in a sparkling red gown with feathers in her hair
bad marilyn monroe imitation hi im miss bunny and welcome to my hollywood revue
she giggles where the stars shine forever
tin foil is wrapped around everything the walls doors and ceiling
fake cement handprints of movie greats cover the tiny floor
badly sculpted statues of marilyn monroe groucho marx and john wayne stand in the corners
dead center is a small puppet show stage
hi this is the place where the magic happens
a stuffed squirrel dressed in a gray skirt and jacket a tilted hat sits atop its head

a single flashlight beam cuts through the darkness of the dense woods
bill stumbles behind baby she is clearly in her element
how much further

well yeah kind of
jerry is stretched out across the front seat reading a book on freak shows
denise and mary sit in the back curled up under layers of blankets and clothes
fuck its freezing
hey listen to this
i think this is related to our dr
yeah in this book theres a chapter called self made freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show
it mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of borneo and shit like that but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of
having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm less wonder
yeah so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree
it says records show that ellie thompson was born in of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings until such time that she was placed in the
care of the willows state mental facility
now she was put in the nuthouse in at the age of
scanning the book blah blah blah
it doesnt say but she was released sometime in only to reappear as ellie bogdan the arm less wonder
says she criss crossed the united states constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in
these dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved dr
satan working at the looney bin
ill bet he amputated her arms
i dont know i just thought it was interesting
you know what jerry who really cares at this point
to himself i just thought it was weird
bursting in god damn it i must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch
that stupid hillbilly slut
oh dont blow everything out of proportion
you didnt see the look she threw me
shes up to something
yeah jerry she said some pretty fucked shit to us
when you were outside with bill
she said we look like pussy lickers or some shit like that
yeah she said we looked queer
aw get over it shes just some dopey redneck she aint smart enough to be up to nothing
i mean anything
an old gothic farmhouse stands atop a hill at the end of a long sloping dirt road
scarecrows with pumpkin heads hang crucified on crosses lining the drive
everything is severely overgrown
bill and baby enter the gates of the farm they walk up the main drive
baby runs forward and begins jumping around in the huge mud puddles then runs up onto the front porch of the old house
the front of the house is covered with strange junk art
hundreds of dolls faces are nailed to the walls
these are all my dolls
i use to like to chop their heads off
broken bottles and cans are cemented together in weird human figures animal skins stretched over bone armatures form a makeshift roof
glowing down from the upper windows are grinning jack o the doors locked
ill gotta go around
baby runs off around the side of the house
bill stands looking off into the distance at the desolate farm grounds
the rain continues to hammer down
from bills pov we see a silhouette of a lone figure walking in the distance
the shape of a large dog follows behind him
bill jumps startled by the sound of the heavy front door opening
christ you scared the shit out of me
aw you aint seen nothing yet
is your brother ready to go
yeah he already left
well wait inside come on
yeah come on
baby grabs bill by the arm and pulls him into the house
the heavy iron door slams shut
denise and mary sit facing one another playing cards
mary deals from a deck
jerry naps in the front seat
how long has it been
i dont know
about half an hour
a metal klang is faintly heard
what was that
i didnt hear anything
turn off the radio
mary reaches over the front seat and turns off the radio
they sit in silence
i dont hear anything
whispering shhhhhh quiet
i still dont
turn on the headlights
see if anything is out there
mary turns on the headlights
denise lets out a blood curdling scream
jerry bolts up
standing dead center in the road is the giant shape of a man holding a heavy chain with a huge hook on the end
lock the doors
everybody scrambles to lock the doors
holy fuck holy fuck holy fuck
on closer inspection jerry notices the chain is attached to the back of a tow truck
hold on hold on
everybody calm down
its the tow truck guy
i think im gonna have a fucking heart attack
scottish accent ok lassies i think its time you get to gripping reality
enough with the stupid voices
the brute man attaches the chain to the car and begins raising it with his truck
a sign on the side of the truck reads firefly towing
we are watching a scene from the old dark house
gloria stuart raymond massey and melvyn douglas are standing in the rain pounding on a huge wooden door
knock again louder
i should of thought that was loud enough to wake the dead
thats an idea
wouldnt it be dramatic supposing the people inside were dead
all stretched out with the lights quietly burning about them
im sure it would be very amusing
we pull back from the tv to see bills clothes drying by the fireplace
bill now wearing overalls and a flannel shirt is sitting on an old over stuffed sofa
so you live here alone
i mean with just your brother
speaking from the next room no
theres a bunch a us round somewhere
i think mammas sleepin
she sleeps a lot now
do you want marshmallows
um yeah sure i guess
you sure do a lot of guessing
baby sets down the tray making sure to bend over close to bill
she hands him his drink and sits down next to him
baby moves closer to bill he begins to get nervous
pointing to the mounted animal head over the fireplace what kind of animal is that
a dead one
sipping his drink mmmmm this is tasty
scoops out some marshmallow with her finger aint the only thing tasty in this house
licks it off i wonder what time it is
seems kind of late
dont worry sugar
it aint past my bedtime
are you flirting with me
no im was worried that
i was just wondering whats taking so long
got into a crash and killed everbody
thats not something to joke about
rolls her eyes ok sorry
maybe the great pumpkin ate em up
finally the sound of a truck pulling up can be heard
bill jumps up and goes to the window
hey great theyre back
sarcastically whoopie fucking doo
on the b w screen we see dr
wolfenstein a local horror movie host
he looks like a cross between the wolfman and lon chaney in london after midnight
sounds like wolfman jack aaaahooooh the doctor is in
dont move dont scream
stay tuned for more creature craziness from channel s halloween eve movie marathon
im your host
your ghost host with the most baby

bill stands on the front porch watching as the truck roughly jerks the car to a stop
jerry jumps out opens the back door and helps denise
looking at bill hey nice outfit billy bob
thanks for coming to get us
little brother almost scared us to death
quietly to bill as he passes dude your chicks a little high strung
mary is the last one out of the car
she says nothing as she walks to join the others on the porch
her look says it all as she walks by bill and into the house
mary im sorry but he left without me
come on you dont think id leave you stranded out there
everyone stands around at the fireplace trying to dry off
i gotta call my dad and tell him were gonna be late
can i use your phone
baby sits silently watching tv
excuse me may i please use your phone
sarcastically bill why dont you ask her
shes your special friend
a voice from upstairs answers

mother comes into view from the darkness above
she is in her fifties but looks younger
a sleazy white trash queen
she slowly descends the stairs
you really dont have a phone
i had one once back in maybe
i dont know

hey maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone

i mean obviously we will compensate you for your troubles
oh you aint no troubles no no no fuss
claps her hands baby

is doing with these nice folks automobile
baby slowly rises like a defiant child and walks out of the room
in the meanwhile please make yourselves at home
gruesome crime scene photos flash across the screen
singing off screen bodies in your bed some are green some are red
eat the flesh and pick the bones drink the blood when you get home
bodies in the ground some are blue some are brown
gather round the people said where do you go when you are dead
mother jerry denise and mary are all seated on the sofa
bill sits in an easy chair

glances at jerry which is where we were headed when our car broke down
yeah i guess ill just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters
and im gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples
ill bet you are
you are a naughty little thing arent ya

bill and mary snicker at jerrys comments
denise tries to keep a straight face
oh i get it

no just a little too old
oh really well i hope something changes your mind some day
baby returns from the garage

the yard whats that

they grin and bear it
imitates elvis yes thank you
thank you very much
mother touches jerrys shoulder suggestively youre a strange one arent ya honey
i think you and me are get on like
she thinks for a second like something real good
camera moves over to the tv
the end fades up on screen
wolfenstein appears over the credits
there well who knew there was love to be found in the old dark house
coming up next do not move a muscle an artery or a vein as we venture into another creepy classic
are you ready for the wolfman baby
bill jerry mary and denise are now all seated around a large dining room table
a thick mountain of candles sits burning dead center on the table giving off a warm glow
dozens of halloween decorations dangle from strings over the table spiders bats and black cats
there is a hand made paper mache mask sitting on each plate
holding up the witch mask i hope to christ she doesnt expect us to wear these things
whatever it is just do it
the more we play along the faster well get the hell out of here
really now is not the time to make waves
hey im just waiting for cousin itt to show up
mother walks in holding a covered serving tray
you sure you dont need any help in there
no dear im fine
now what kind of host would i be if i put my guests to this kind of work
she sets the tray and goes back in the kitchen
the sound of the front door slamming shut is heard followed by the pounding of heavy footsteps
mothers and babys shouting is heard
ma tinys in
go tell him to get your grandpa
baby is standing in front of her closet staring at her clothes
the walls of her room are covered with b w photos of movie stars
whining ma i cant im busy getting dressed
tiny enters and removes his coat
everyone is speechless
tiny is over seven feet tall and weighs three hundred pounds
he is wearing a black sweater with a big red skull stitched into it
a red knit ski mask covers his face
black gloves cover his hands
tiny sits at the table looks down at his plate and says nothing
mother comes to fetch tiny
she relays a message to him with strange hand gestures
tiny gets up and leaves the room
youll have to forgive tiny he cant hear so much
yeah my poor baby
its his daddys fault
i mean earl was a good man
i mean he never hit me or nothing but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all
oh im sorry its none of my business
he tried to burn the house down said it was possessed by the spirits
tiny was sleeping in the basement where the fire started
i dont think earl ever meant to harm us
but tiny was badly burnt his ears were destroyed and most of his skin
is that why he wears the mask
yeah my baby boy gets shy around new people but hell warm up to ya
especially the ladies
i thought i felt a certain attraction between mary and tiny soon as he walked in
hes a real lady killer
didnt ya think mary
mary just smiles then gives jerry a dirty look
well well see
the night is young and so are you
oh well couple more minutes
mother returns to the kitchen
elbows jerry dont be such a fucking smart ass
yeah its really your fault that were stuck in this shithole in the first place
oh dont worry she didnt get offended by what i said
you two got to lighten up
whatever at this point all i care about is food
im starving and i got a fucking killer headache
hey i asked you if you wanted some chicken
didnt look like chicken to me more like fried pussy cat
shrugs tasted pretty good
in a cramped darkened room we see the huge shape of tiny hovering over a bed containing the hunched fragile old body of grampa
grampa struggles to sit then slowly slides his legs over the edge of the bed
tiny helps him to stand
god damn it i can do it
i can do it myself ya big monkey
i aint dead yet
so dont you and your sister start counting out my money yet
grampa steadies himself against tiny
they slowly walk out of the room
god damn my dogs are barking
as they move into the light of the hallway it is clear that grampa is in his late s
grampa quickly grows tired
tiny picks him up in his arms and carries him down the stairs to the dining room
as they move past the camera comes to rest on a strange object sitting on a shelf
a large glass jar containing a deformed baby
the pickled punk looks to have a small second head growing from its temple
the label on the jar reads stuffy
the sound from the tv fades up in the background
bela lugosis voice can be heard
your hands please
your left hand shows your past
bela is seen as a fortune teller holding a womans hands
this is a scene from the wolfman
and your right hand shows your future
we see a tight shot of the womans palm
a pentagram appears
we pull back from the tv to find donald willis sitting in a old easy chair
the room is modest but comfortable
he reaches over and picks up a small alarm clock notices the time concerned look comes over his face
the phone rings
he quickly answers it
he mutes the tv
i was hoping you were denise shes a little late
pausing yeah yeah im sure the rain just slowed em down
uh huh yeah
no no you can keep it til tuesday
alright talk to ya tomorrow bye
unmutes the sound on the tv
the feast is on
mother tiny grampa jerry bill mary and denise are gathered around the table
ok everyone put on your masks
we cant very well eat with our everyday faces exposed
mother puts on her mask tiny and grampa follow
jerry bill and denise slowly raise up their masks mary hesitates
to mary christ kid put it on
she aint letting any of us touch the grub til youre wearing the damn thing
mary rolls her eyes and complies
ive been meaning to ask you mrs
mmmmm odd name
firefly do you know anything about the legend of dr
here we go
grampa shifts his eyes onto mother
nervously well im not much for local gossip an this and that but ive heard it mentioned in passing over the years but
i mean folks is queer and they say things crazy things you know what i mean
its all talk yakty yak like a bunch of hungry chipmunks
that takes the bulls nuts alright
starts laughing hey i hear some genius up north got a hot line on the easter bunny for ya
a voice from the shadows interrupts
slowly i know all about what you want to know about
a pale figure creeps forward like nosferatu from a dark corner of the room
this is otis
he stands six foot but is deathly slim
his skin is translucent glowing in the dark
long thin white hair covers his head
his eyes are grey
he is an albino
he is holding a glass jar containing a small fetus
on closer inspection we see there are two small bodies joined to one head
the label reads wolf
happy surprise otis
i cant believe you decided to come down and join us
and you brought little wolf
this really is a special night
all my babies together
otis sets the disturbing jar of wolf on the table
he leans forward onto the jar resting his chin
now i dont know where you heard all your little fairy fables about dr
from a captain spaulding down at some museum
laughing that old bitch hog dont know shit
he tells cute little tattle tales to sell his junk but he dont sell no yankee boys no truth
but something happened right
i mean the story is based on a real incident right
mouth full of food what are you jimmy olsen cub reporter for the daily asshole

i aint sure that you really need to know
its better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs
i really want to know
hey the kid wants to know
boy i bet youd stick your head in the fire if i told ya youd see hell
meanwhile you too stupid to realize you got a demon sticking out your ass singing holy miss moly i got a live one
can we please change the subject
the clock on the wall strikes ten
shouting dinners over
pushes his plate back and stands up ladies and germs
grampa hobbles out of the room
whats he so excited about
yeah showtime for what
for the show
its halloween eve and time for our show
oh you mean on tv
no no no its so much more special than that
youll see youll be the first to ever see
i think this is something youll really love
billy jerry mary and denise stand waiting in front of an old barn
tiny unlocks the huge doors of the barn and swings them open
standing inside waiting is mother
she is all dressed up for the occasion
please come in
how many in your party
she counts the heads one two three and four
right this way
mother hands each of them a folded piece of paper which serves as a program book
hand drawn on each is an orange pumpkin
we follow mother inside
thousands of red christmas lights hang down strung through the rotting wood rafters
crates barrels and an odd assortment of chairs face a large quilted curtain
filling these seats are lifeless dummies
please be seated
mother motions toward four empty seats in the front row
whispering this is way too fucked up for words
loud whisper i know the words
fucking psycho fucking bullshit thats the words
just grin and bear it
holding stomach ugh i feel like im gonna puke
jerry bill mary and denise take their seats
mary flips open the program
inside written in crayon are the words halloween extravaganza starring the comedy legend grampa and the world famous baby
to bill check this out
well ya cant complain i never take you anyplace
the sound of a warped crackling record fills the room
a small spotlight hits the quilted curtain covering the stage
mother firefly stands behind the controls
she is smiling proudly
the curtain clumsily parts to reveal a stage set pieced together from amusement park wreckage
a giant painted plywood devil looms over the stage surrounded by dancing skeletons and demon girls
a microphone stands center stage
quietly i cant believe what im seeing
i know this is fucking nuts
this is starting to make me real uncomfortable
just sit back and enjoy the show
the sound of canned applause fills the room
bill begins to applaud jerry and denise join in
mary does not
ladies and gentlemen straight from his smash six week sold out run at tiki ti club
the stardust lounge is proud to present mr
grampa walks out to center stage mic in hand and begins to speak
hey let me tell ya a story
so im hanging out with my buddy hal jackowictz and im like hey hal lets go get some booze and chase the chickens
fucking hal says no no the old battle axe at home will break my balls
i gotta get my ass home
the kids stare in shock at grampa
jerry begins to laugh
so i tell im

i mean jam your face right in the bush
jerry starts to giggle
quietly what are you laughing at
i dont know i think hes funny
this isnt funny its twisted
so hal goes home jumps in starts chomping and licking away at her pussy shes screaming and howling
totally passes out from the experience
dear god let this end
hes feeling pretty good so he goes into the bathroom for a quick shave
pauses suddenly he lets out a horrible scream
the recorded crowd chuckles
sitting there on the toilet is hals wife gloria
and she says quiet down youll wake grandma
the recorded crowd screams with laughter as does jerry
bill denise and mary look at him like hes crazy
thank you youre too kind too kind
stay in your seats coming up next we got something special for you men out there
the curtains close and the stage goes dark
shit im all for being a sport but this is ridiculous
looking at his watch man its already ten thirty
im with denise cant we just walk to someplace this is getting fucking stupid
shit we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero
yeah id say at this point all we can do is just wait it out
theres nothing else
i mean theyre obviously all bonkers but i guess theyre harmless
i fucking hope so
the stage lights come up
the recorded applause and music begin
baby enters the stage
she is dressed in a home made showgirl outfit
she begins to dance clumsily to the music
she appears to be somewhat intoxicated
the vocals come on and baby begins to lipsync to the song
you gotta be kidding me
this chick is wasted
how much is a person supposed to stand
motioning for mary to keep her voice down quiet
sarcastically oh im sorry bothering you
was i disturbing your viewing pleasure
baby makes her way down from stage on to floor level
she gyrates and seductively teases one of the dummy audience members
baby moves over to jerry
stroking her hand down his face
denise tries to look amused
jerry smiles uncomfortably
baby strolls past denise and stops in front of mary
baby pauses and pinches marys cheek and winks
mary is baby moves over to bill
mary watches like a mother hawk
baby sings and dances with all of her attention focused on bill
baby puts her arms around bills neck and sits on his lap
mary bolts forward and shoves baby off of bill
baby crashes onto the floor
take that you fucking slut
mary spits at baby fucking redneck whore
you shouldnt a done that
you gonna do something about it
standing up yeah ill do something
baby takes out a straight razor from behind her back
ill cut your fucking tits off and shove em down your throat
firefly runs down from her position behind the spotlight and intercedes
come on ma
this bitchs got it coming
no i told you
the garage door slides open
rufus has returned
interrupting cars done
i suggest you kids leave now
dont worry im gone
bill jerry denise and mary climb back into their car
dont look back just get in the car
lock the fucking doors
bill begins to pull the car down the long dirt driveway towards the road
the heavy rain makes visibility difficult
straining to see through the darkness almost there
jesus you think she was really gonna cut you
leaning her forehead on the window of course she was gonna cut me shes a fucking nut
closes her eyes and takes a breath i knew she was crazy from the second we picked her up
suddenly baby pounds her fist against marys window
mary jumps back in terror
screaming youre in hell bitch
youre gonna die like a dog
baby disappears into the darkness
get us out of here
bill pulls the car up to the front gate
it is chained shut with a huge padlock
lightning crashes illuminating the crucified scarecrows
flash close up cuts of grinning jack o lantern faces peer down from above
bill opens the car door starts to get out
hysterical what are you doing
i gotta open the gate
drive through it
it wont work
holy fuck hurry up
jerry mary and denise watch through the windshield as bill struggles to unlatch the thick iron gates
suddenly one of the scarecrows jumps down from his cross and smashes bill over the head with a heavy club
bill drops to his knees
jerry throws open his door to get out
hes shoved back into the car by another larger scarecrow outside his door
this scarecrow begins smashing the cars windows with a metal bill lays motionless face down in the mud
his attacker turns his attention on the car
he also begins smashing the cars windows
from a distance we see jerry pulled from the car and beaten
the girls are helplessly trapped inside the destroyed vehicle
the scarecrows continue to pound on the car
as we fade out the sound of a barking dog can be heard
from a long shot we see the farmhouse in the early morning sunrise
all is still
the sound of an engine starting breaks the early morning silence
rufuss tow truck is seen pulling away from behind the house
the beaten remains of bills car are towed behind it
darkness except for the face of an alarm clock
the time is am
tick tick tick
the alarm goes off
a hand reaches over and turns off the alarm
we hear a deep groan
a light turns on
don willis wakes up having fallen asleep in his easy chair
he sits up and wipes the sleep from his eyes
he runs a hand across his head smoothing out his thinning grey hair
he picks up a phone next to his bed dials a number waits
lieutenant broekman please
listens yeah im alright
but i need you to check on something for me
willis stands walks to the window opens the shades morning sun fills the room
shelf by the window is cluttered with framed photographs
b w memories of denise at the beach rudy the dog
high school graduations and donald willis in uniform with the other members of precinct
donald is a former police officer
im a little worried about denise
she called me last night from the road out by ruggsville at some joint called spauldings or something like that said shed be here about eleven
but she never showed up
yeah if you could run a check on up that way and see about any accidents or road closing or anything id really appreciate it
listening yeah yeah i know
im sure nothing happened but you know me i like to worry
hangs up the phone
mary opens her eyes squinting into the light
sunlight peers through filth on the windows fractured by the tattered remains of rotted curtains
peeling yellowed newspaper serves as wallpaper surrounding the window
marys eyes move across the walls to a painting of a big eyed kitten
she stares at it and smiles
a look of horror begins to appear on her face
she begins to scream uncontrollably
off screen shut your fucking mouth
she is hysterical
i said shut your mouth
zoom back to see mary wearing a dunce cap tied to a chair facing a corner in the farmhouses attic
this is otiss art studio
otis standing before a large canvas sets down his paint brush and calmly walks over to mary
he spins her chair around clamps her mouth shut with his hand and leans his nose against hers
slow and sinister listen you malibu barbie middle class piece of shit
im trying to work you got me work
you ever work
marys eyes scream with terror she nods yes
yeah ill bet you did
scooping ice cream to your shitheel friends on summer break
well i aint talking about white socks with mickey mouse on one side and donald duck on the other
shit you aint reading no funny books mamma
otis raises his paint covered hand
this is blood and guts suzy q
our bodies come and go but this blood is forever
pulls a small book from his breast pocket let me read you something listen and learn
otis pulls back his hand ready to backhand her across the face with the book
she nods again
he lowers the book
gesturing dramatically and the angels all pallid and wan uprising unveiling affirm that the play is the tragedy man and its hero the conqueror worm
pauses you get that
art is eternal you get me mamma
mary stares dumbfounded
now im gonna remove my hand
you make a sound and i swear ill slit you open and make you eat your own fucking intestines
you get me
she nods again
he slowly removes his hand from her mouth
mary tries to remain calm but starts to hyperventilate
tears roll down her face
why are you doing this
messy up your day
well fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand
than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit
chuckling well bill
hes a good guy hes been great help to me
a real blessing
i couldnt have asked for a better specimen
i mean you dont know what a dry spell ive had total block
slaps his forehead total block
but bill hes ok
mary looks confused but relieved
softly where is he
lets go see
otis grabs the back of the chair and drags her across the room towards a curtained off area
he pulls her through the curtains
from behind the curtain we hear mary screaming and otis laughing
behind curtain bill
no no no
what have you done
carefully arranged on a models platform is the severed torso of bill sewn to a large homemade fish tail
he is lying on his ride side posing
bills face is frozen in a death scream
the fish boy
repeating to herself this cant be real this cant be real this cant be real
oh its real
as real as i want it to be mamma
grabs his canvas and holds it in her face look see the magic in my brush strokes
painted on the canvas is the gruesome scene of bill as the fish boy
crying fuck you you fucking freak
oh come now
were all creatures of god and freaks in our own way
twitches and shakes but if youll notice
points to a blank spot in the painting right here needs a little something heh
otis slowly puts down the canvas turns and picks up a huge hunting knife
what are you doing
squirming no stop
you my dear worm feeder are about to become immortalized
otis draws back the knife
otis swings the knife forward directly into the camera
ravellis clown head bobs back and forth
ravelli wearing his clown head stands by the road side waving to passing cars
a police car drives past ravelli and comes to a stop
officer george wydell a big slightly paunchy man with a big mustache and mirrored sunglasses steps from his car
following close behind officer steve naish tall athletic
pauses looks around pulls up his belt well lets go see if the nut that runs this place can help us
they walk to the door
the door swings open
wydell enters slowly putting on his best cowboy attitude
naish follows suit
wydell hands on his belt struts up to the counter
no one is around
a rusted bell sits on the counter taped to it is a handwritten note ring for service
wydell rings it once waits no response
rings it again waits no response
looking around the room get a load of all this crap
this is one sick place
wydell begins ringing the bell non stop
spaulding shouts from the backroom
whoevers a jerking off on that bell better be gone when i get out there
cause im gonna rip your nuts off
spaulding enters from behind the curtain angry
he sees the troopers and puts on a phony grin
officers officers what can i do for you today

pulls a paper from his pocket what i need are some answers
unfolds the paper to reveal a picture of denise well ill try but i dont know nothing bout nobody

hands him a note pad enough talk write
we are cruising down the road
a bobbing head skeleton toy glued to the dashboard wiggles with each bump in the road
behind the wheel is rufus jr
riding shotgun is baby dressed in her sunday best
the radio is blasting
screaming over the music were gonna have fun tonight bro
they speed off
the police cruiser maneuvers down the rough dirt road
wydell and naish scan the surrounding woods for any sign of denise and her friends

bills car is down in a ditch run off the side of the road
naish checks the license plate number with his sheet

a small crummy liquor store stands next to a sleazy motel
a filthy looking hooker leads her customer to a waiting room a homeless bum stands screaming obscenities in the parking lot
the store is decorated for halloween
off to one side is a curtained room
a sign reads xxx mm loops sex noises can be heard inside
baby and rufus stand at the counter waiting for the cashier a skinny geek with glasses to total up their purchases
the counter is loaded with bottles
the cashier is packing the bottles into cardboard boxes

baby and rufus exit
rufus loads the boxes into the back of the truck
baby sits on the curb and lights a cigarette
bills car is now sitting in the middle of the road
the back is attached to a police tow truck
an additional police cruiser arrives on the scene
sheriff huston steps out from his cruiser
whatd we here georgie
a vehicle registered to a william s
holy jesus somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing
yeah no mercy here
recover any bodies
inspecting the car shit i wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on em
just in the wrong place at the wrong time
thats the understatement of the year
yep i suppose it is
naish is digging around under the front seat
hey i found something
naish crawls out of the car
whatd ya got there
well christ boy dont stand there like a prize dog dick with his butthole caught up a tree
open up the trunk
toss em over here
naish tosses them over the car to wydell
wydell fishes through the keys finds the trunk key and opens it
winces god damn
you find something georgie
disgusted yep i found something
we move around the car to see the nude body of karen murphy laying in the trunk
her arms and legs are hog tied
she is dead
the word trick is carved into her side
water drips down from the leaking pipes above
scavenging rats scurry across the concrete floor
in a far corner a single light burns a childs humpty dumpty lamp illuminating denise is strapped to an old wooden bed
she has been stripped of her own clothes and is now wearing a blue checked little girls dress
her hair is tied in pigtails
she is cold and shivering
the basement door opens heavy footsteps lumber down the creaking stairs
it is tiny
tiny is wearing an orange t shirt that reads this is my halloween costume
for the first time we see the skin on his arms it is severely deformed from burn scars
he is holding a small tray
on the tray is a box of cereal milk a bowl and a spoon
tiny goes over to denise sets down the tray and proudly displays his t shirt
hoarse and dry please
let me go
tiny sits down on a stool next to the bed he stares down at denise like a confused dog
crying please god please
tiny begins preparing her food carefully pouring the cereal and milk into the bowl
he stirs it with the spoon
tiny gently lifts denises head and feeds her like a baby
denise swallows the food trying not to choke
after a few spoonfuls tiny stands up and walks over to a dark corner of the room
he pulls a string and turns on a swinging ceiling light
in the light we see a rusty cage inside are three rail thin female bodies
tiny throws the remainder of the cereal into the cage
one of the bodies moves to eat the scraps the others do not
they are dead
tiny turns off the overhead light
wydell and naish are pulling into a large truck stop parking lot
you sure this guys supposed to ride with us
seems kind of weird
scanning the parking lot chief said pick him up and take him with us on our house to house
guys an ex cop thinks he can help
sounds like a bad idea to me probally just get in the way
yeah well i guess its tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kids missing
besides aint no such thing as an ex cop
i guess not
that must be him
a rundown gas station sits off to the side of the road
a filthy mechanic works on one of the many junked cars
two fat greasy men sit in the hot sun playing cards
a chevy nova sits parked next to the station
willis leans against the side of the car drinking coffee from a styrofoam cup
a police cruiser pulls up
wydell and naish step from the car
this is naish
wydell extends his hand they shake hands
to wydell any leads
well we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town
closest thing we got to a lead at this point
well all we know is the kids were headed out to a spot the locals call deadwood to play nancy drew with some local legend about this character everybody calls
yeah its horseshit just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with
anyway theres not much else out that way
so i figure maybe theres a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms
what about the body you found
slightly surprised oh yeah you know about that
hmmm thats a strange one
local girl karen murphy been missing for a couple months figured for a runaway
fit the profile
no not really
good kid never been in any trouble
her part in this i cant figure
but i will
wipes his brow christ you know its crazy
gets choked up i lived through so many other peoples nightmares you know
always cool and calm but
but i never thought id be the one needing help ya know
dont worry well find her
lets hit the road sooner we get a move on sooner well find her
willis dumps out the remaining coffee tosses the cup into the trash and opens the back door of the police car
he gets inside
wydell and naish climb in
the car drives off
close up on a bloody bandaged face
as we pull back to see jerry completely bandaged like a mummy strapped to a wall
his arms and legs are spread
knives stick in the wall next to the body
off screen god damn bitch what the fuck are you waiting for
charles nelson reilly dont know shit
we pull back further to see otis pacing wildly back and forth in front of his tv watching match game
grampa sits eating a tv dinner
gesturing at the tv with a knife watch that bitch shes thinking about that klugman bangin brett sommers pick motherfucking richard dawson
otis throws the large hunting knife at the wall next to jerry
hes the fucking slick jack match game man mamma
where do they find these people
christ four kids couldnt just disappear
no they couldnt somebody had to see something
my denise is a smart girl she wouldnt do anything stupid and her boyfriend he always seemed like a good kid
im sure theres a logical explanation
i pray to god there is
turn up this road
where we headed
i seem to remember another farm set way back off the road where the car was found
im not sure if anyone lives there anymore but its worth a look
wydells cruiser turns up the road to the firefly farmhouse
it moves past the scarecrows and comes to a halt
the doors swing open and wydell naish and willis get out
im gonna see if anybodys home
you and mr
willis take a look around the grounds for any sign of anything
to willis come on
naish and willis head off around the back of the house
dirty dishes overflow from the rusty metal sink onto the surrounding counters
a large cat walks across piles of food left to rot on a table
boxes of trash and old newspapers are stacked to the ceiling
music from a crackling radio is heard
mother stands stirring a large pot on the stove
a loud knocking interrupts her cooking
she sets down her spoon and walks to the front door
before opening the door she peeks through the curtains of a small side window
she sees wydell and runs from the kitchen
wydell walks up the front steps
mother runs toward a door at the end of the hall
she swings open the door
mother bursts into the room
come quick theres cops outside
god damn how many
watching tv what
dont worry about it
otis jumps up and goes over to an old dresser and opens a drawer and pulls out an automatic revolver
i dont know
i only saw one
im sure theres more than that
fucking pigs always travel in packs
handing the gun to mother here take this
takes the gun what should i do
go down stairs and play nice
im a gonna go round back and handle things like i always fucking do
naish and willis move through the cluttered back yard of garbage
shit dont these packrat hillbillies throw anything away
you hear that
the soft sound of moaning can be heard
yeah i hear it
wheres it coming from
over here inside the smokehouse
naish and willis stand in front of a brick smokehouse
the thick door is chained shut
knocking on door anybody in there
the moaning gets louder
we gotta break it open
i aint got a warrant
willis picks up a broken axe handle and begins prying open the door
tell it to my daughter
grabbing hold to help shit
together they struggle to open the door
mother slowly opens the front door
the revolver is behind her back tucked in her apron strings
trying to be sexy well hello officer
holding up his badge excuse me im sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon
aw you aint disturbing me but it kind of looks like rain dont ya think
my name is lt
wydell id like to ask you a few questions
well heck ill tell you anything you want to know
i appreciate your cooperation
im looking for a missing girl
holds up picture this girl here denise willis
have you seen her
no i aint seen her sorry
she begins to close the door
wydell stops her
please could i please come in and talk to you for a minute
maybe you could take a better look at the picture
might stir up something
no i dont think so
please just a minute
i guess i can trust you
being a man of the law and all
she opens the door
oh you are very welcome
lord knows how i love a man in uniform
she closes the door
naish and willis bust open the door to the smokehouse
hanging upside down inside is mary
she hangs from ropes strapped to the ceiling
large hunks of meat hang around her in the cramped room
wydell and mother sit opposite eachother at the kitchen table
pictures of denise and her companions are spread on the table
wydell takes notes as mother talks
do any of these kids look familiar in any way
no i cant say that i ever seen em before
points to the photo of bill he looks familiar is he on tv
suddenly naishs voice comes over wydells walkie talkie
excuse me for a second
pulls walkie talkie from his belt to respond
we found one
mother points the gun at wydells head and fires
he falls dead to the floor
naish hears the commotion over his walkie talkie
into walkie talkie wydell
fuck go to the car
call for backup
tell em officer down
willis runs to the car he gets about halfway there before he is hit in the back by a bullet
he stumbles and falls to his knees
he kneels silent stunned
we hold on his face and watch as his life passes before him
a quick montage we see the following images flash by a
a father and daughter together in happier times
a childs birthday party
a baby crying
willis and his deceased wife
otis fires another shot
willis falls forward into the mud dead
naish sees willis fall
before he can react a voice calls out from behind him
hands up bitch
naish raises his hands
turn around real slow
naish turns around
interlock your fingers behind your head
naish hesitates do it
naish kneels down
from a distance we see otis standing over naish execution style
a white puff of smoke comes from otiss gun and a distant popping sound is heard
naish falls over on his side
the scene fades to blood red
the house stands silent in the darkness
lightning crashes a heavy rain falls
burning jack o lanterns beam from every window
smoke rises from the chimney
it is halloween night
wolfenstein is on screen smashing pumpkins with a giant hammer
it is midnight my little boils and ghouls the witching hour
time for all monsters murderers maniacs and madmen to go to work
so lock your doors and bolt your windows sit back and prepare for a fright night classic
lightning crashes the house of frankenstein
the movie begins and we move off the tv to see hundreds of candles are lit illuminating everything with a flickering light
music blares from a cheap stereo
black and orange paper streamers are draped from ceiling to floor
dead center is a large object standing seven feet tall it is completely covered in paper halloween decorations
a long chain connects the object up into the rafters
this is the halloween party from hell
an intoxicated grampa dressed as flash gordon sits in his wheelchair watching the tv drinking moonshine from an unmarked bottle
slurred drunken yelling at the screen get those motherfucker
those high water bitches and rocketship daisies
kill em kill em
tiny stands in a corner tunelessly banging on a large oil drum
he is dressed like a low budget batman in grey long johns and a black bat mask and cape
a drunk rufus wearing a bloody police uniform stands on a table shouting along to the music through a police megaphone
mother and baby both dressed as superheroes dance around the covered object
both are swigging moonshine from jugs
shouting through megaphone show me show me show me show me
mother and baby start tearing away the paper covering from the object in the middle of the room
they rip at the paper spinning and dancing around in a wild pagan ritual
as the shreds of colored paper fall to the floor we see denise jerry and mary tied back to back hanging from the chain each are dressed in a different
denise is a pig jerry is a donkey and mary is a rabbit
they are gagged
mother and baby laugh at their helpless victims splashing moonshine in their faces
drink up its party time
enjoy your last night
looking around wheres otis
oh hes coming he got something real special this year
rufus jumps down begins to spin the bound captives around and around
otis otis otis otis
quiet quiet you know he wont come down with all this hoop dee doo bouncing off the walls
now calm down
i shot an elephant in my pajamas this morning
how he got in my pajamas ill never know
then we tried to remove the tusks but they were embedded in so firmly that we couldnt budge em
gesturing at grampa let him finish
of course in alabama the tuscaloosa but thats entirely irrelephant
the room goes silent
all eyes are focused on the stairs
a robed figure otis appears at the top of the stairs he begins to descend
rufus waits at the bottom of the stairs
as otis reaches the last step rufus hands him the megaphone
denise mary and jerry struggle to watch as they in turn rotate past the scene unfolding
through the megaphone im the one who brings the christmas candy
now tell me pauses and raises his arms whos your daddy
otis walks closer to the rotating captives
im the one who brings the devils brandy
waits whos your daddy
im the one who beats you when youre bad
whos your daddy
whos your daddy
otis stops the spinning of his prisoners and stands directly before denise
he drops his robe underneath he is wearing a suit of skin sewn together from pieces of denises father
denise stares in horror tears stream down her cheeks barely able to comprehend the madness around her
otis moves in close and licks her across the face
im the one who loves you when youre fucking dead
everyone chants whos your daddy
imitating willis now i say my little darlings
rotates the chain to mary maybe prancing around where you dont belong aint such a winner of an idea
slaps mary across the face slowly turns the chain to face jerry
and you the great rusher of fools what were you after
slaps jerry huh speak to me
slaps him again oh thats right dr
everybody got to know about dr
satan jesus christ let the old dog rest for fuck sake hes already got one foot in the grave and the others tap dancing around the edge

so im gonna do you a favor a big big favor

im gonna let you meet the old bastard
thats a horses ass alright i told you
jerrys eyes widen in fear
baby roll that old love machine over here so this boy can meet his hero
baby rolls grampa over to jerry
lifts his skin mask you see its all true the boogieman is real and you found him
jerry stares in shock why so sad
isnt this what you begged for
there he is the living legend himself ta da dr
now dont get shy on me
ask your hero some questions dont blow this last in a lifetime opportunity
zarkoff i will conquer the sea the air the earth
mother moves in close to jerry
look at the way he lights up
grampa just loves meeting his fans
otis grabs jerrys cheeks and makes his face move like a ventriloquist dummy provides jerrys voice
aw gee whiz im so excited
i really think youre the coolest
youre tops on the playground cooler than the fonzie
baby grabs mary and does the same ventriloquist routine
oh oh pick me pick me
i have a question
baby rotates mary around to where gramps is seated
squeezing marys face hard i was wondering mr
satan sir do you like to kiss on the first date or is that considered slutty
what the fuck are you saying
who the hell is talking to me
tiny growing restless begins banging on his metal drum
klang klang klang
rufus joins in clapping his hands
come on my babies are getting restless
dump in the pit dump in the pit dump in the pit
mother baby grampa join in chanting with rufus
cut em down its time they get what they came here for
the rain pounds down
a heavy fog hovers over the dense growth of the field
in the distance silhouetted by moonlight a gruesome caravan slowly moves through the night
otis lantern in hand leads the way
followed by baby and mother together under a large black umbrella
next rufus holds the leash connected to jerry denise and mary
bringing up the rear tiny shotgun focused on the prisoners and grampa
grampa is strapped to tinys back like a child
he waves a flashlight back and forth like a search beam
the group comes to a halt at a huge wooden structure
handing baby the lantern hold this
point it over here
baby directs the light at otis
we see that he is trying to unlock a huge padlock attached to an iron door embedded in the base of the wooden structure
otis unlocks the door and swings it open
he reaches down into the blackness and pulls up an iron hook and wench attached to the hook is a chain
otis parts a section of the overgrown grass next to the pit to reveal a rusty metal crank
he begins to turn the crank
slowly from out of the pit rises a coffin hanging from the end of the chain
otis pulls the coffin over and lays it flat on the ground
he flips open the lid
hey happy boy step your ass up here
rufus cuts loose jerry but holds him steady by the neck
take his gag out its more fun with the screaming
yeah i like the screaming too
its so much more exciting
rufus cuts loose the gag
please dont kill us please dont kill us
imitating jerry please dont kill us please dont kill us
bitch shut your mouth and get your shit in the box
let us go please
let the girls go
imitating jerry let us go please
let the girls go
otis pulls out a gun and points it at jerry
wait i want to say good bye
mother grabs jerry by the collar and gives him a big kiss
bye sweety we could of been great together
please let us go we wont tell anybody
aw honey you know i cant do that
we wont tell anybody
otis cocks the pistol
jerry starts to slowly move towards the coffin
christ aint this fucking a hoot
alright mamma i aint got all fucking night
please please this is insane
you cant do this
rufus pushes jerry into the coffin
it is and i can
denise starts kicking and fighting with rufus
rufus tries to hold her steady when suddenly mary breaks free and starts to run
laughs and raises his pistol wheres she think shes a gonna get to
shes gonna run all the way home
let me get her
turns to mother ma otis is having all the fun
can i get her
thats true otis
not that were having a bad time but
rolls his eyes well go get her
baby jumps with excitement and runs off across the field after mary
mary trips and falls over a small gravestone
she gets up and stumbles back into a wooden cross
she tears the gag from her mouth and gasps for air
there once was a woman who lived with her daughter in a cabbage garden
mary turns toward the voice but sees nothing but wooden crosses
she is in a homemade cemetery
along came a rabbit and ate up all the cabbages
the woman said
mary turns degrees but finds nothing
go into the garden and drive out the rabbit
mary is hit from behind she falls forward
baby jumps on top of her and sits on her back
baby is holding a large hunting knife
said the maiden
mary screams in pain as baby plunges the knife into her
baby stabs mary again and again and again
mary lets out a long gurgling scream then goes silent
come maiden said the rabbit
leans down sit on my tail and go with me to my rabbit hutch
baby covered in blood licks the knife clean
otis shoves denise into the coffin with jerry and locks the lid shut
through a cross shaped opening in the coffin we see them crushed together
rufus lowers the coffin into the pit
once the coffin is inside otis slams the door shut
otis opens a small window in the door and lowers in a lantern and a small tape recorder playing music
the dim light of the lantern shines off the slimy wet filth of the rotted wood walls
the stench of death and decay hangs heavy in the thin air
denise and jerry cold and shivering hang half submerged in thick maggot infested sludge
bits of animal and human skeletons float in the muck broken bones lay in piles along the walls
through the dim light we see the tightly packed forms of jerry and denise
hysterical weve got get out of here we got get out of here
try to open the lid try to kick a hole in the wood
crying i cant
i cant move my arms
i hurt so much
i know but we can make it out of here
we can do it
a loud thump is heard against the side of the coffin
that was good babe just keep doing that
thats not me
im not doing that
someone is out there
shouting help were in here
help help us
suddenly an arm breaks through the side of the coffin
another smashes through the top of the lid
the coffin begins to violently shake
another reaches through grabbing her feet
the coffin is ripped apart and jerry is pulled away from the destruction
he lets out a quick scream before disappearing into the darkness
the spastic light of tv static strobes across the sleeping face of grampa
beside him mother sleeps peacefully
the rain has stopped
tiny opens the doors to the barn
he goes inside
he exits a few moments later dragging a huge wooden stake
he sets the stake down carefully and closes the barn doors
he then picks up the stake and drags it away
behind the farmhouse is a camouflage jungle an intricate system of ropes and netting is strung together to hide the many automobiles beneath
rufus moves through the jungle
he stops and begins to remove the netting from a car it is wydells police cruiser
he climbs inside the car puts on wydells policemans hat and starts the engine
he drives off
rufus is driving like a maniac through the open farmland
he turns on the overhead flashing lights
the police cruiser twists and turns in the barren fields
denise stands knee deep in the sludge
broken bits of the coffins remains are scattered around her
jerry please answer me
a soft moaning sound is heard coming from the other end of the pit
moving slowly forward is that you
denise cautiously makes her way to the bend at the end of the tunnel
as she approaches the moaning sound gets louder
she turns the corner to see two pale figures in filthy hospital gowns hunched over a shadowy object
they turn towards denise revealing the partially devoured dead body of jerry
the two bone white ghouls are dripping with jerrys blood they stare at denise then return to their prey
denise screams in horror and runs turning down another twist in the underground maze
she turns the corner and runs straight into several slow moving ghouls
the ghouls are of the same deathly white complexion hair less with flaked cracking skin
their yellow eyes shine in the darkness
they reach for her but she breaks free and continues to run into the endless stretch of tunnels before her
primitive wooden crosses form a circle around a burnt piece of land approximately twenty feet in diameter
laying flat in the center is the large stake marys body is draped across it
tiny is securing her to the stake with rope
through the windshield we see baby jumping and dancing in the fields with several large dogs
she is firing a gun as she dances
baby sees the car and raises her gun
she aims it at the car driver
she waits as the car gets closer she sees the face of rufus behind the wheel
she lowers the gun and begins to laugh
the car stops and baby climbs into the passengers seat
the car drives off
tiny lifts the stake with mary firmly strapped in place
he implants it into the ground
her body hangs like a doll
tiny opens a gasoline can and begins splashing gas onto the stake
otis face painted like a skull and wearing a priests robe walks solemnly through the tall grass
denise waist high in sludge wanders lost through the endless tunnels of the pit
in the distance she hears high pitched animal sounds
a ghoul rises up from the sludge behind denise
it stands silent
it reaches out a boney hand with long curled fingernails and grabs her hair
denise screams and tries to pull away
the ghoul grabs her with his other hand and pulls her closer clawing at her face
denise fights her way free but loses her footing and falls backwards slipping under the sludge
she quickly resurfaces and starts to run
otis stands in front of the bound mary holding a pumpkin
otis places the pumpkin over marys head
tiny stands behind him holding a lit torch
the police car drives wildly through the fields
baby motions to rufus to steer the car towards the fire
a beaten denise struggles down a long tunnel
she gets to the end to find that it is a dead end
behind her five ghouls move silently towards her blocking her only exit
the ghouls slosh through the muck moving in closer
denise frantically looks for an escape nailed into the wall next to her are planks of wood forming a ladder
the ghouls are only a few yards away
denise climbs up the ladder
they move in clawing at her legs and feet trying to pull her down
denise digs at the wood and mud ceiling above her trying to break free
denise is bleeding severely from the chunks of flesh being torn from her legs
she digs wildly at the ceiling suddenly a board falls free and mud rains down to reveal stars the sky above shines through the hole
denise smashes her fists at the rotted wood planks pulling free another piece
with all her might denise grabs hold and pulls herself up through the opening
denise fights her way through the earth and pulls her body up into the night air
the cool air rushes to her lungs
she crawls free of the hole gasping for air
she is safe
a ghoul has broken through the surface
he grabs denise by the leg and begins to pull her back into the hole
denise screams and begins kicking violently at the ghoul
she breaks and crawls from the ghouls reach
rufus and baby have pulled the police cruiser up by the stake
rufus and baby stand on the hood
otis finishes his sermon he raises his arm
tiny raises the torch
otis drops his arm signaling tiny
tiny throws the torch onto the stake
the stake ignites into a huge fireball
denise pulls herself to her feet and begins to run
the flaming object burns in the distance behind her
denise stumbles toward the road on two badly injured legs
rufus tiny and baby jump up and down in celebration smashing the police car
otis stands transfixed by the flames before him
denise makes her way out onto the road
no cars are in sight
in the distance headlights break through the darkness
denise stands in the middle of the road
the truck comes into view it is a small cube truck
denise stands in the headlights waving her arms for it to stop
the truck comes to a halt
she runs toward the passengers side door and climbs in
behind the wheel of the truck is captain spaulding
denise is shaking from shock
hold on girly whats the problem
becoming hysterical murdering
blood and jerry
starts to cry uncontrollably monsters
i got away
well i dont see what the fuck youre getting at but i got some friends that live just up this road
starts to turn the truck up the road back towards the farmhouse
no thats it
that house is
tries to open the truck door i gotta get out i gotta get out
the metal door leading to the back of the truck slides open
ravelli grabs denise and pulls her back into the back of the truck
the metal door shuts
the truck quietly turns onto the dirt road leading up to the farmhouse
the jack o lanterns still burn in the windows grinning their evil grin
