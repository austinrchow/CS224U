written by cory goodman i pass the vale
i breast the steep
i bear the cross the cross bears me
john charles earle oxford book of mystical verse the moon
so fat and full in the night sky you can reach out and touch it
this is whats known there has always been man
and there have always been vampires
black shapes swoop past the moonscape vicious looking things
much shrieking and wailing
atop a stone ziggurat we see a group of men aztec warriors readying themselves with primitive weapons slings bows spears
tonight they know they will die
since the beginning the two have been locked forever in combat
the vampires were quicker stronger and had the gift of flight
quick glimpses of a bloody brutal battle
fiery arrows launched against an unseen enemy
with a howl we see a man plucked off the ground his body disappearing in the night
the image dissolves as the sky turns bright the moon becoming a familiar ball of yellow gas
but man had the sun
the camera tilts down to find another group of men more sophisticated than the first
makeshift weapons made of metal and steel slung across their backs glinting in the sunlight
they stand before an earthen structure looks like a giant wasp nest
unsheathing their weapons they step grimly inside
we hear a hissing wail and the wielding of steel
and so it went like this over many years
as man and vampire both evolved the wars became bloodier
from afar we see giant stacks of corpses as hydraulic machines stack the black bodies into pyres as big as buildings smoke rising to the sky in twisting columns
stands at the base of one of the mammoth pyres
even from this angle we sens e his quiet dignity
then came the priests the man turns and we see his face is shadowed by a large cross tattoo cutting across his eyes and down the center
specially trained warriors in the art of vampire combat
they single handedly turned the tide for the humans
quick glimpses of a group of priests battling a fury of vampires we still do not get a good look at them
their technique is otherworldy combining the brutality of a maori warrior
with the grace of a samurai
the combat is intense
an explosion of blood and s b m i l over time the vampire threat faded
the once fierce race now fatally diminished
a shadow of what they once
through heavy smoke we see a pile of vampire corpses a ragged collection of fangs and claws
the remaining vampires were put into camps and by decree of the high clergy the priests disbanded
the former warriors to be integrated as members of regular society
we see a wax seal pressed onto an ancient parchment
the document carefully rolled and stored in an ornate chamber
the human race thrived in relative quiet
the vampire menace quickly forgotten for other more modern threats
and the few surviving priests faded into quiet obscurity
the chamber is closed
we see an encrusted key turning in a heavy set lock and we s
our story begins with the rusty scrape of a windmill
dust swirls in nasty tangles
a lone male figure moves across the plain long and lean in overalls
shadows flicker across his sunburned face the windmill looming above him
in his hands is an electronic device he plunges it into the earth
it makes a series of clicking sounds reading the soil
aaron looks up to see the silhouette of a woman standing in the doorway of his cabin
he smiles waving to her
a pioneers wood cabin
aaron sits surrounded a lattice work of vines covering the walls and floors in beautiful patterns
not a trace of soil anywhere in the room everything hydroponically grown
he smiles studying a
stunning ruby red flower separate from the others
his crown jewel
he closes the door and enters shannon pace carries a bowl filled with a steaming green broth placing it on the dinner table moving aside a tiny figurine of jesus
the surrounding furniture cluttered with religious knickknacks
you been spending an awful lot of time behind that door
makes a woman suspicious
its taking a little more time than i thought
nothing special about milkweed
unless you like a thorn in the finger
its not milkweed
not this year
what is it
his eyes skate to her face moving in for the kiss but hes yuck
pershing stew again
already a heartbreaker
this girl is too young too pretty to be out here in the badlands
i cant do it anymore
being all cooped up like this
im going honey
we know this hasnt been easy for you in two years someone elsell study the soil and thisll be their outpost
but for right now this is my job
i dont know what its like to have a best friend
to have any friends
i want to have a crush
i want secrets
i want a life
shannon looks at her husband
she knew this day would come
shes thirteen she should be with children her own age
aaron lets out a breath
next year well figure out a way to get you to a school close by
n year thats still plenty of time for you to have a crush
lucy deflates knowing this is as good as its going to get for awhile
aaron takes her hand
tomorrow im heading in town to file
you come with help your old man out get a change of scenery
now cmon stews getting cold
bow your heads and say grace
the family clasps hands
whatever their differences theres a bond here
dear lord we thank you for what we are about to receive
blessing us with your gifts
speaks with her eyes clenched shut words spoken sincerely nothing perfunctory about it
shes a believer
we thank you for the earth and the sky and for your bounty through christ our lord she
stops opening her eyes staring at the plates and glasses on the table
he cocks his ear heading a low rumble
although hes never heard the sound before
he knows it can only mean one thing
trying to remain calm aaron goes to the window
framed by a blood moon hanging over the horizon a dozen black motorcycles race across the plain engines thundering
the jesus figurine falls off the table shattering to the floor
aaron looks at shannon an expression on his face she hasnt seen before get the boards whats going on
aaron doesnt answer shannon helping him position pre cut planks across every window and door
each with an iron cross strut for support the cycles circle the house kicking up dust in sheets
the roar of the engines fills the house as aaron pulls a powerful looking gun from the drawer
he drops it obviously not familiar with firearms
get by me
shannon and lucy crouch at his feet
the cycles cut their engines headlights centered on the house
a blistering spotlight
the riders step from their machines
we dont get a look at their faces as one by one they leap onto the house and windmill skittering across the walls and roof like spiders
the blades of the windmill slowly come to a stop
outpost r same the power goes out everything going black
we hear the riders crawling over the outside of the house
snarling howling making terrifying sounds
then the worst sound of all
wood being torn apart
aaron shoots like crazy the white light muzzle flashes providing glimpses of shapes moving inside the house
black bodies blown back
everything happening lightening fast
finally the gun clicks empty and were plunged back into darkness
aaron is still standing the house in shambles around him
from outside we hear the cycles revving
aaron runs to the door
rips off the board in time to see the motorcycles racing away a cloud of dust in their wake
aaron runs after but trips on her body lying in the dirt head lurching at an obscene angle
he brushes back her hair ere g unct ure mabks in hem neck
crying he cradles his wife
feverishly looking around for he keeps screaming but its no use as the motorcycles fade in the night he knows theyve taken her
the camera tilts to the moon hanging above the plain
it turns black as we now find ourselves peering into
the lip of an enormous smokestack
one of hundreds
a seemingly endless brick forest reaching to a sky heavy with soot and ash while below miles of factories stretch and stretch
hundreds of workers trail listlessly from a massive brick and stone complex
grey faces betraying another days toll
moves through the crowd people stepping out of his way
they do this not out of respect
we dont get a good look at him
just flashes shaved head
eyes like nail guns
tendons clenching over muscle
as he walks people whisper
he hears all of it
he heads into the streets
citizens hurry by some with
surgical masks over their mouths
theres a pale sickliness to them
the figure suddenly stops
he cocks his bald head somethings caught his attention
we move through trash and shadow finding a gang of factory workers uniformed surrounding a girl
their leader holds her close butcher knife at her throat
mouth at her ear
scream for daddy
he hears a noise looks up and sees a silhouette standing at the head of the alley
looks like daddys already here
points the knife well then
come on daddy
make it better
the figure steps into a pool of white light giving us our first good look at him a lal rge ak cross tattoo shadows most of his a e
across the eyes and down the center
the mark of the priest
well lookie here
we got us a real life war hero boysl heard you guys were real baddasses
the workers all pull out large knives
guess well find out
they move in on priest chemicals burning in their blood mouths leering
priest folds his hands into the prayer position
the workers look at each other
whats he gonna do
bless us to death
voomi theres a whirling snarl of sound the sonic equivalent of a back flip and pries is holding their knives
before they can react he throws the knives into their feet
they howl pinned to the concrete
scared the leader clutches the girl pressing against the brick wall as priest moves towards him
this aint the war no more
you got no right meddlin
you dont belong here you aint one of us
and with that he raises the blade to the girls throat whooshi a sudden rush of air
the leader looks at the girls neck his blades gone
so is his hand
priest holds the severed limb its fingers still clutching the blade
the leader collapses a holy shitl expression frozen on his face
gawks at priest possibly more frightened of him than the workers
he turns to her wanting to comfort her but not knowing how she flinches and runs away disappearing into the street
a beat as priest pries the butcher blade from the hand wiping it off
tucks it in his waistband
he moves on
gone to seed
the once proud house of god now a sad collection of moldering stone and cracked stained glass
push past row after row of empty pews
we stop on the confessional booth a foot sticking out from the door father koeppen body skinny and ravaged
the old man pours himself a drink and downs it
the confessional door opens someone steps inside the other booth
we cant see who it is
bless me father for i have sinned
the voice is like gravel from the bottom of a deep well
koeppen knows it well
i caught the ambulance picking up what was left of the factory boys
figured it was your handywork
the shape leans forward we see it is priest
this time there was a little girl
if this keeps occurring itll be impossible to keep it from the clergy
youll get us both excommunicated
priest gazes into the vestibule his voice almost a whisper
i want to see the other priests
you know you cant
the clergy forbids it
they have their reasons
priest flicks his eyes over koeppen as if he could see through the vestibule but his expression doesnt change
and their reasons for building more and more factories
the sky is turning black
since when is
industriousness a sin
did jesus not teach us to be productive
as your appointed counselor take my advice
relax take up a hobby pick a vice
youre my friend
im a wicked old man whod sell his parish for a pint of whiskey
priest seems to deflate his hard shell cracking
i dont know whats happening to me
im not sure what it is
koeppen slides the vestibule open so they are now face to face
the devil comes in many shapes
do yourself a favor keep your head down
and most of all remember your oath
he hands priest a set of rosary beads
to go against the church is to go against god
this statement has always been the boilerplate of priests existence but tonight it just sounds like empty dogma
he squeezes his eyes shut clutching the rosary as we cut to garbage litters the floor
the sound of water dripping
priest stands waiting for the lift to arrive
a boy and his mother wait too
the boy stares at priest fascinated his mother doing her best to pretend not to notice him
the elevator arrives and they step inside
as it rises a single bulb flickers above
the boy continues to stare at priest bewitched by the tattoo
did it hurt
the lift grinds to a stop
the mother quickly pulls her son out as the door rolls open glaring at priest disappearing down a dark corridor
and only now does priest answer
the lift door clatters shut
sparse containing only whats needed
priest peels off his shirt revealing a constellation of old battle scars punctures
his skin showing the early signs of aging
he goes to the lone decoration in his apartment he takes the picture off the wall studying it
the image bringing him peace
from the streets below the sound of a gunshot
he looks at the rosary beads still in his hand
he turns out the light
unable to sleep priest sits on the edge of his bed
theres a knock at the door
who is it
priest opens the door
a messenger holds up a punch card
i gota priority punch
originated in the wasteland
priest takes the card the man writing up a receipt
priest goes to a wooden box feeding the punch card into it
a rube goldberg like device of pulleys and winches squeaks to life like a sail a screen rises and aaron appears his image a smudge
he looks awful
a man at the end of himself
l lucys gone
they t took her
i tried to stop em
but can you find her
find her before
they killed shannon
the screen goes blank
priest shuts his eyes making the sign of the cross
his hand curls into a fist
at the cities center a municipal of baroque basilicas and churches all safely walled off from the rest of the metropolis
giant shafts of moonlight hit a marbled floor
priest and father koeppen are led by four officers before a tribunal of monsignors all at least in their s
they sit behind a giant table cloaked in the florid robes of their religion
men of scripture creed and doctrine
priest kneels bowing his head
thank you for meeting with me on such short notice monsignors
even the monsignors are uneasyaround priest
their leader orelas leans forward addressing him
father koeppen notified us of the situation
our prayers are with your family
i come before you because i would like my authority to be reinstated
on what grounds
priest is taken aback
shes my blood monsignor
the proper authorities are handling the situation
im sure theyll
do a fine job
the proper authorities
all occurrences of vampire
disobedience and felonies are strictly a federal matter now
you priests did too good a job
the vampire population is classified as endangered
they are the enemy
the war ended a long time ago
not so long that we should forget what they are capable of
you would do well to remember the words of our savior turn the other cheek
embrace your enemies
it is not our place to interfere or yours
priest looks up obviously in great turmoil
i can be of
great service to the investigation
the tribunal shifts uncomfortably intimidated by priest
you forget yourself priest
it has been brought to our attention that you have engaged in a number of transgressions
do you feel yourself to be above god
engaging in any kind of practice is sacrilege you bring shame upon our house
priest turns the full force of his gaze on him
let your light shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven the monsignor pounds the table
you dare quote scripture to met questioning the
of the clergy is forbidden if you engage in another transgression
you will be stripped from the order and excommunicated immediately
do i make myself clear
i said do i make myself clear
youre a soldier
gods soldier act like one
remember your vow to go against the church is to go against god
the officers start to lead priest and koeppen out the chamber
kam please stay behind for a moment a
we have something we need to discuss
off koeppens expression we cut to homeless stand single file wrapped around the corner black flakes of ash drifting down as they await tonights supper
priest sits alone rosary beads clutched in his hands
he looks up to find koeppen the old man staggering as he downs an expensive bottle of whiskey three sheets to the wind
i knew id find you here
he sits pouring himself another drink toasting the poor souls at the surrounding tables
how many nights in this very spot
you with your endless questions on the nature of suffering me with none of the answers
priest doesnt even acknowledge him lost in his thoughts
well now im the one with a question
this ones a riddle
what is greater than god but more evil than the devil
the poor have it the rich need it and if you eat it
priest looks up his eyes cold
why wont they listen to me
koeppen takes another drink
im going to
give you one more riddle and if you listen close you might just hear an answer to your question
clears his throat
how can a man who spent his whole life searching for devils miss the ones staring him in the face
from behind a clicking sound
priest turns to find an officer standing laser guided shotgun pointed at him
the soup kitchen suddenly deathly quiet
the church feels its better to keep you under its care
at least until this trouble with your niece blows over
you know i cant do that
thats what i figured
jackboots clacking they form a circle around priest and koeppen
guns snap into place laser points dotting his body
priest looks at koeppen betrayed
to go against the church is to go against god
priest looks around the room families and homeless huddle at the surrounding tables terrified
theres only one thing left for him to do
i go against god
in an eyeblink priest strips the gun from the nearby officer cracking it against the troopers head his attack graceful and precise a whirlwind of pinpointed blows and shattered bones
when its over eleven troopers lie on the ground writhing
everything goes quiet
he breaks from his father
knee slowly moving towards the window drawn by a flickering shadow
his mouth drops open as punch through the windows in unison showering everybody with glass
bullets whistle through the air everyone screaming as they scramble for cover
the father diving for his son
folds his hands into the prayer position
vooni theres a pop of air and the troopers look around confused their guns have disappeared
a neat pile of shotguns sit every fired bullet collected harmlessly in a clean circle around them
as if picked out of thin air
is somehow back with his father the two safely holding hands staring stupidly at each other
priest is gone
looks at his fancy whiskey bottle inside now floats priests rosary beads
he fishes them from the bottle hand shaking
heaven help us
he takes a swig
the strike of a match a prayer candle is lit glowing in the darkness
priest kneels eyes clenched shut in prayer
a large figurine of jesus on the cross looms over him
the christ is expressive he suffers
oh my god
i am sorry for
having offended you
it was never my intention to do so
his words continue over priest standing in front of a steel door
hasnt been opened for some time
i want so much to firmly resolve with the help of your grace to sin no more and to avoid the near occasions of sin
the door slides open just a crack
a sliver of light landing on a piece of black sculpted metal
but i cant
an engine roars rumbles idling
a throaty gurgle
priest pulls out on a if this thing were a horse itd be the ultimate stallion pulse engine
a panel of black titanium solar cells covers the bike like armor
he races onto the street
sheets of rain fall like lead
pooling in the gutters
all i can do is ask for forgiveness for what is yet to come
the cycle knifes through the city
expertly working his way through congested streets
moving past tent cities stockyards and rusty industrial machinery
we see a massive wall a hundred feet high surrounding the city
priest pulls up to a checkpoint tower
a phalanx of guards with big shotguns at the ready snapping into place
mugs like anvils
i now know the devil lives within me
the sins coming all too easy
still on his bike priests foot touches the ground blocking our view as we cut to the massive door wall sliding open with a klang revealing the wasteland
and all too frequently
priest revs his bike gunning out the doors
unconscious bodies left in his wake
an endless plain of cracked earth
nothing around anywhere
priests cycle streaks across the salt flats
priest rides past a line of ancient statues dominating the landscape each representing one of the seven deadly sins sentinels marking the boundary into the deep wasteland
he floors it the bike punching for the horizon a thick plume of dust funneling behind it
its quiet just the sound of the rusty windmill
the only light provided by the moon reflecting off priests cycle hes just arrived
he crouches examining a fresh tire tread
he stares taking in the landscap e feeling it
then he steps inside the cabin it looks like a war zone
splintered furniture everywhere sprays of dried black blood over the floorboards
he brushes away rubble and finds a dress shannons
putting his face to it he inhales his expression softening
quietly a cowboy hat and a shotgun barrel emerge from a hole in the floor
alright now not another step
climbing out from the hole both barrels pointed is sheriff hicks
you could say the name fits
but youd only be half right
thought youd come back for a souvenir hub
you gotta be the dumbest bloodsucker i ever come across
priest steps into a pool of moonlight illuminating his face
if i was a vampire youd be dead already
the cross tattoo a striking image
hicks stares pushing his hat back on his forehead
ill be dammed
he casually spits some atomic chaw hitting the floorboards with a sizzle
hicks and priest ride in tandem across the plain
hicks bike a standard police vehicle nothing fancy but reliable
they head towards town passing awooden sign at a glance this seems like one of those frontier towns from an old western
townspeople gather around a snake oil salesman the man pitching his wares before a painted van reading dr
tomlins medicine show
trance music wafts from the nearby saloon
do i ask for three dollars
do i ask for two dollars
one piece of tin and protection is yours
pull up in front of the jail
hicks eyes the salesman coolly dismounts and adjusts his hat
ascuse me a minute he heads towards the crowd the salesman continuing his pitch
vampires are a deadly lot
you could be next i i seen a blackblood bite a man like a gingersnap
the only sure way to be safe is a bag of dr
tomlin s wonder holds up a sack if you care about your loved ones then you must have this amazing elixir in your homes tonight whoosh
a knife slices through the air spears the sack and pins it to a nearby wall with a thunk
hicks steps to the front of the crowd
its his knife
you best get in that van and clear on out mister
for what reasons
im a legitimate business man
hicks pulls his six shooter cocks it
i got six right here
sheriff i am shocked you can be
so cavalier with the safety of your ham
a bullet blows out the vans headlight
the windshield cracks like a spiderweb
immediately the salesman quickly packs up his wares scrambling for the van door
as he gets in he catches a look at priest pauses a moment then starts up the vehicle and quickly peels away
hicks pulls the knife from the wall holds the bag up to the crowd
now you all listen up
this bag aint good fornothin but linin that mans pockets with your hard earned money
much shuffling amongst the people they trust in their sheriff but theyre frightened
an older man named crocker steps up
you dont knowthat
youre just a kid
i seen enough two bit hustlers and carry barkers
he aint no better
but what if hes right
hicks tosses the sack to crocker
take a look
crocker does the contents spilling to the ground aint nothin but sand flour and maybe a little garlic
oldest trick in the now i dont blame you for bein afraid
but those vampires headed clear
on out and they aint comin back
and what about the girl
this is not easily said
i filed a report with the cities last night
im sure theyre join all they can
the townspeople mutter amongst themselves
hicks looks over to priest a group of children have already gathered
pointing and whispering at him
a hole in the wall
a few wanted posters and postal warrants tacked up on a board beside asingle jail cell
hicks leads priest inside
ive already had one of the boys send for your brother
we got him put up at paddys place
priest gazes out
a group of townspeople are milling out front staring at him
he pulls down the shade
youre gonna have to excuse the attention
we dont get strangers round here too much specially no priest
course we aint never had no vampire attack in
these parts before
but then youre just here to perform the service right
priest doesnt reply staring at a yellowed wanted poster
never much of a believer myself
i figure i got one bullet to shoot
im gonna shoot it my way
not how some book tells me to
but i do hear things
it true what they may about you folks
you can fold time
at that priest turns looking at hicks
before he can answer the door opens and comes through looking older than the last time we saw him
seeing priest his face cracks smiling for the first time in days
overcome he wraps his arms around his brother embracing
priest hugs him back
a blind gravedigger plays an old
sqqueezebox hands expertly working the bellows
hes done this for every
funeral in halbridge for the last fifty years
the sad music drifts across the wasteland
lies in a freshly dug hole
priest sprinkles dirt across
the casket offering prayers
a group of townspeople encircle the grave
everyone wearing black goggles for protection from the swirling dust
stands apart from the others hat in his hands
his eyes focused on priest
not even watching as aaron plants the ruby red flower at the head of the grave
its glorious color almost obscene in this barren wasteland
a dog rests lazily in front of a rotating fan
paddys a bear of a man the town bachelor
he plops down two bowls of brown stew before a waiting and hungry aaron and priest the gruel smells foul tastes fouler
never served no man of the cloth before
hope you like it spicy father
he stands over both of them eager for a response
priest takes a sip grimaces tries his best to smile but fails hideously
delicious slaps him on the back course it isl it was me mas recipe
as paddy jubilantly walks away priest puts the bowl on the floor and the dog pads over eagerly lapping it up
how come you never came round more
you know you were always welcome
after the war was over we figured youd stay with us
shannon was real fond of you
she was always asking about you
uncomfortable with the conversation priest pulls out a map unrolling it onto the wooden table
he moves his finger across the paper
the pack headed in this direction
theres a reservation up that way so thats where ill start
if anyone finds out youre doing this
o r priest youre my brother
this is enough ill find her
and you bring her back to me
something in priests face darkens
he doesnt answer not able to look his brother in the eye
a shopclerk mops the floor guns of all types lining his walls
everything from old smith and wessons to the latest and most powerful hand cannons
with a jingle the door opens revealing priest
the clerk smiles
all he needs is one look and he knows this guys good for business
good afternoon sir
how may i be of service
i need bullets
how many do you have
the clerk laughs
then realizes hes serious
no offense father
you got a permit right
i have this
he pulls out a sack of coins it hits the counter with a solid thud
the clerk smiles wider
hundreds of bullets all orderly lined on a table top
priest site with his back to us hunched over a candle
were unable to see what hes doing
aaron picks up a bullet twirling it in the light
maybe if i knew how to use these shed still be alive
sometimes things just happen
faults got nothing to do with it
im the one who used to say that
you were the one who always said everything was gods will
priest takes the bullet from him
im not so sure anymore
theres a knock at the door
aaron opens it slightly
its sheriff hicks
you mind if i have a word with your brother
an awkward beat as the two stare at each other
both knowing what the others thinking
let him in
eyeing priest aaron lets the sheriff in shutting the door behind him as he leaves
the vibe in the room is uncomfortable priest not even acknowledging hicks
im sure youre well aware of the vampire protection act
it strictly states it is forbidden for anyone to hunt vampires anymore
priest doesnt say anything he just keeps working
these days things go through proper channels
paperwork drawn up
investigators called in
spits a wad of tobacco course we both know after a week girls taken by vampires either and up dead or worse turned
im sure you also wouldnt be surprised to know my officesbeen contacted
im supposed to arrest you on sight
he pulls a shiny object from his pocket puts it on the table beside priest
on the other hand if i go after lucy therell be a warrant on mybead too
and thatll put us in the same briar patch
priest looks at the object its hicks sheriffs badae
five points glowing brightly in the candlelight
we leave at sun up
a moment as each man studies the other
were the only chance shes got
priest picks a bullet from the table a carefully notched cross now in its tip this is what hes been doing
he snaps it in the air
hicks knife flies across the room pinning the bullet to the wall
a thin trickle of gun powder leaks from its casing spilling to the floor
the kids fast
how you with a gun
better than i am with a knife
priest considers this
ill be there
nothing more needing to be said hicks turns to walk out stops at the door
whats with all the bullets anyway
i thought priests dont use firearms
theyre for you
hicks nods realizing priest was ahead of him the whole time
moonlight streams through an open window
priest places his bible on the nightstand and crouches beside the
bed closing his eyes
our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name
thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
as he continues the camera slowly moves out the window and into the night moving across halbridge
forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil
we see the townspeople lock their doors bolting the shutters tucking their children in safely for the night
for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever
and now the camera stops on a large shadowy figure perched on a nearby roofline
the only thing we can see of it is a duster illuminated by the soft glow of a lit cheroot
the figure watches priest as he finishes his prayer and blows out a candle
silently the figure takes off
flying into the night
the sky is brightening the edge of the world turning white
sunlight hits shannons grave the cross marker casting a shadow the once glorious red flower already withered
aaron watches the sunrise some other time he wouldve been moved by the sight maybe even cried
priest is beside him
you never talked much about the war but i know you saw things
whatd you do
to make yourself unsee em
to make it stop playing in your head
did it help
priest doesnt answer the question hanging overhead a dark cloud
i never used to be much on faith
you but then lucy was born
and as soon as i saw her i knew
i just knew i theres no way something so perfect came from me
she was a gift
looks at priest you find her
whatever it takes
priest nods his brothers eyes burning into him
hearing the sound of an engine both men turn to find hicks pulling up
didnt mean to be late my deputies are a little green about keepin the peace all by their lonesome
needed a pep talk
figure ill ride point
i know my way round the wasteland better than just bout anyone
without so much as a word priest climbs on his cycle and kick starts it the engine revving to life
vroomi off he goes
hicks cant help but laugh
real charmer your brother
thats just his way
dont pay it no mind
you just bring back my baby
then he revs the throttle speeding after priest
watching until their cycles are just distant specs
a series of shots as priest and hicks blast across the barren wasteland
they make a strange pair not exactly butch and a
thundering past strange rock formations bizarre shadows cast across the plains
a group of wandering monks holy men carrying offerings to the desert bow as they race by
see a photo of lucy now stuck to hicks windscreen
astride their bikes priest and hicks look down at a valley
a series of adobes sit clustered in the basin
the nightshade reservation
aint nothin but red outs and rejects
theyre a fallen tribe
we have two hours to get in and out
what happens in two hours
hicks looks up at the sky
the sun tilting towards the horizon
priest and hicks enter engines idling flocks of chickens run riot underneath their tires clucking
this is how most of the reservations are these days
we see faces peering out from wooden slats
gaunt lifeless eyes
familiars are illegal
nobody really enforces it
most come from the fringes
theyre creepy as all hell but harmless
they turn off their bikes and dismout
hicks stepping awkwardly between the chickens
a male familiar stands with a butcher knife over a basin
his gaze is slack more dead than alive
he picks up a chicken and chop off goes its head blood draining into the container
his voice a hissing rasp
good afternoon sheriff
what brings you to nightshade
were looking for a vamp pack
they woulda came through here a couple nights ago
nobody comes through nightshade
thats the way we like it
nice and quiet
then you wont mind if we have a look around
the familiar picks up another chicken
raises the butcher knife
not at all
chopi the head clatters to the ground
priest and hicks move through the reservation looking for clues
priest goes to the nearest structure two eyes peer from a tiny slat
the crypts familiar
were not going to find anything out here
we have to get into the crypts
not supposed to do that without a warrant bami priest kicks the door in
we hear the familiar screech as priest steps inside the light of the suns never been in here
probably should have stayed this way
tiny bones cover the entire floor
excrement smearing the walls
the crypt familiar cowers in the corner shielding his eyes from the light
his bodyfishbelly white and sickly
got got you must got master will be angry
nicks is grimacing from the stench
he looks at priest not happy as he approaches a stone sarcophagus
running his hand over it
wheres the girl
pleease please got no
maybe your master will know
not noi the master cannot be disturbedi priest rests his hand against the
atone slab covering
it must weigh pounds
he moves the slab
just a centimeter but the familiar screeches
wh re is she
please dont hurtmy master
masterll be dead
he shoves the slab more the light rays hanging just outside the edge
and now the familiar begins to laugh a horrible rattling sound
something in his mood has shifted
no i dont think so
hearing a noise hicks turns witnessing a horrible sight moving towards him about ten of them
real night of the living dead stuff
makeshift weapons in their hands
scythes slingblades buzzsaws
before hicks can react attacks butcher blade raised
the blade buries itself in hicks arm
lets loose with a mean roundhouse
plugging him in the chest
in one quick motion he rips the butcher blade from his arm flinging it at the nearest the blade lodges in his skull and he drops like a sack
these guys move surprisingly fast hicks is already surrounded
he hears a whistling noise as knifes through the air heading straight for him
he ducks the blade whistling past sawtoothing into the torso of another familiar
pulls off his cowboy hat
activating a release
with a click
thousands of needle like teat ext e d fro the brim
with deadly accuracy he flings the hat it flashes through the air daisiwheeling around a familiars neck pinpricking his skin and finally whirling back to hicks band likean obedient pup
a beat as the familiar stands mouth agape
then with a wet snap his head rolls off his shoulders thudding in the dirt
hicks falls to the ground his wound starting to get the best of him
he musters up his strength for another hat attack but before he can leaps in front
blocking his way
with a horrible screech the familiars attack launching at priest and hicks
blades in the air
priest charges into the frenzy
his movements clean and calculated bones breaking around him with a wet snap bodies thudding at his feet
when the dust clears priest stands alone
and he is holding their weapons
now we can do this easy he tosses the butcher knife it sticks in the ground a hairline from a familiars head
or we can do this hard priest flings another blade
this one plants in the leg of the familiar
where is she
youre too late priest he points to the horizon the last rays of daylight disappearing
its our time now
we hear a low rumble from inside the crypts
priest looks at hicks a feeling of dark electricity in the air anticipation
they get your gun arm
youre gonna need it
slabs on each sarcophagus sliding open
shapes roiling in the blackness inside
the sound of dark mewling things
things already sensing trouble in their midsts
burst from the crypt doorways screeching as they fly into the air
circling above the reservation like a nest of angry hornets
one of the figures swoops low touching to the ground
giving us our first good look at a vampire wet white skin
insect clicking claws
more creature than human
the vampire cackles sounds like dried paper its voice a series of teeth clicking hisses
as it eyes priest angrily
what are you doing here
havent you already done enough
we dont want a fight
were just looking for the girl
the vampire sneers and as it speaks the following one by one the others drop from the sky flanking him
theyre scraggly a little undernourished
look at us living in ruin forced to feed off the blood of animals
we once scoured this land
we were warriors
we were gods
you were murderers
we were what nature made us
flashes his fangs i recommend you leave immediately
you are not welcome here
one black figure still flies above
like a vulture it circles hicks
were not going anywhere until you tell us where she is
then you arent going anywhere
if there was a tumbleweed in the vicinity this is when it would blow by
a tense beat then
priest pulls out a black book
yea though r walk through the valley of the shadow of death x will fear no evil the vampires laugh
your words mean nothing to us priest
and now we see the books actually hollow on the inside filled with dozens of
little star metal crosses
in one quick motion priest scoops a handful snapping his cut through the air heading straight for the black figure
s t soueal
s as the metals it like hot goals through err tc erina it apart the pieces raining down around hicks crashing to the ground
and then all hell breaks loose
the nightshade vampires hiss
bearing their fangs like cobras and taking to the air with a shriek
frightened beyond shit all belief hicks fires wildly chasing the creatures with his gunfire
his bullets whistling harmlessly through the air
a vampire swoops towards him fangs bared claws ready to rip
leaps at the creature just in time driving it to the ground
in one brutal motion he
straddles it twisting its head at a horrible angle
he turns to hicks
and with that hes gone rolling across the ground like a boulder and leaping at two darting vampires
dazed watches as the vampires body erupts with death spasms arms and legs kicking the air in a violent frenzy until finally all life drains away
under his breath jesus
another vampire careens towards him
coming in low crawling across the ground on all fours
hicks fires off a mess of bullets peppering the creature as it flails backwards screeching
he snaps out the empty shells reloading almost supernaturally fast firing off a shot that splits the vampires throat
he twirls the gun flipping it into his holster
this leaves only perched atop his crypt like a gargoyle raging at priest and hicks from the depths of hell with at horrible shriek
in full fury he leaps and flies away the sounds of his torment echoing throughout the canyon as he vanishes into the night sky
should we go after him
hell the at first light
priest goes to the familiars still lying on the ground
theyre sobbing having lost everything in the world that mattered
he grabs one by the scruff of the neck
no more masters
just you and me
he raises a knife pressing it to the familiars skin
frightened beyond belief the metal beast
shes in the metal beast
look for the smoke suddenly rip across priests back
its the lead vampire back for more
claws digging into flesh
priest wrenches around and the two go at it
a fierce feral battle
the vampires fangs chattering inches from his neck
their bodies lock in a horrible struggle rolling across the familiars
the vampires claws churning into their bodies killing them instantly
throws priest into a crypt smashing him through the wall flying in after him
we hear the sounds of a battle royale from inside
whumpi whumpi whump
the walls buckle outward sounds like the fury of all hell being unleashed
then suddenly andmore disturbingly
s az g
hicks takes a step towards the crypt
but emerges through the hole exhausted the lead vampires head in his hand dangling by its hair
he tosses the head and it rolls to hicks feet fangs flashing up at him
hicks stares at the ghastly visage
a giant pyre lights up the night fed with the bodies of both familiars and vampires priest and hicks silhouetted against the flames
the two are silent grimly going about their task its obvious the skirmish has affected hicks
hows your arm
lucky i guess
the blade didnt go that deep
fingering the bandage dont know what got into those familiars to attack like that
theyre usually harmless
priest finds a knipe clutched in a dead familiars hand tucks it in his waistband
a beat as they listen to the popping of the fire
a tension hanging between them
then you did this on purpose didnt you
you knew we wouldnt
be out before sundown
you wanted this to happen
you dont have the stomach for it head back to haibridge right now
hicks glares at priest
the stomach i got
i was in the rangers two years
even fought in the boondock uprising
i saw some crazy things
i just aint never seen anything like this
killing a vampire isnt like killing a man
they come atyou like an animal
tooth for tooth
claw for claw blood skin bones
they take all of it
if you let em
hicks studies priest in the firelight he looks tired
it comes easy to you
it just comes
easys got nothing to do with it
he pokes at the fire it crackles feeding off the bodies
something about the battles opened him up
his guards down
i take no pleasure in it
i know ive done more than my share whatever they do to me i have it coming
you think they took her because of you
cracks his neck
give me your gun
give me your gun
you gonna shoot me now
priests stare is piercing
a pause then hicks pulls his six shooter handing it to him
priest checks the chambers giving it a quick spin
dont anticipate the trajectory of your target
he stomps his foot into the fire launching a glowing coal of ash into the air
priest quickly raises the gun and fires the ash explodes raining fiery red sparks
youre teaching me to shoot
im teaching you to kill vampires
no more wild shots my ass i in case you didnt notice i was pretty damn good out there
and i sure as hell didnt see you doin much when i had that blade buried in my arm
mustve been too busy focusing
priest hands the gun back to hicks
theres always two points
a and b
know the points and youll know your target
aint nothin but a bunch of bullshit
i see ten crypts
but only eight vampires
we find the missing well find lucy
whats the next nearest town
its clear across the plains
gonna be a rough ride
then you better get a good nights sleep
this bunch was easy their bloodlines watered down by man
whoever took lucy was a whole different breed
he tosses another body on the fire tiny sparks floating into the night as
we hear the banshee call of a steam whistle sharp and shrill as we cut to bearing down like death itself teeth of the behemoths grill leering like a skull
thick clouds of heavy smoke burst from its blast pipe rails squealing as the train races past
there re no windows just an unblinking black juggernaut midnight willed into
a steel and iron frame
as the cars blast past the camera we see each is filled with rows of black coffins
a tall figure walks between them wearing a black top hat and cape
we only see im from behind
pale arms reach from within the coffins fingers touching the hem of the figures cape as he walks past
a a familiar approaches
a man came on board at the last stop
says he has something for you
the figure nods
we follow as he continues to the back of the car sliding open the door fine china on oak tables
the snake oil salesman we saw back in halbridge sits nervously in a plush chair
candles light the car casting the room in a surreal flicker
you told me tq come to you if i had any information
i have some
silently the figure sits down across from him
but before i tell you
and i hate to bring this up there is the small matter regarding compensation
now your groups been real good for business so of course im willing to cut you a deal the figure suddenly
lunges grabbing the salesman by the throat teeth clicking inches from the mans neck
we still i can smell the blood racing through your veins
smells like dinner
the salesman starts to shake
a after you snatched that girl outside haibridge
two nights later a priest s showed up
he was meetin with the local sheriff
a real shitkicker booted me out of town before i could make a single sell
and then the figure laughs
the salesman not sure how to react
w whats so funny
the figure buries his teeth in the mans neck taking a deep deep drink having his fill dropping the body to the floor with a thud
the camera continues to follow as the figure walks to the back of the car sliding open the door a sliver of light lands on lying on the floor her
face streaked with tears
vestiges of the girl we met earlier already lost
i wont tell anyone if you let me out
i wont even go to the police
youre in here for your own protection
if i let you out of this car youll be torn apart a piece at a time
he walks to her face still hidden in shadow
she starts to cry pulling back to the wall
my uncles a priestl one of the best
hooll corns after youl the figure laughs
bending down to her level im absolutely counting on it
and now we get our first look at her captor
a cross tattoo h s adows his face
the mark of the priest
engines screaming priest and hicks blaze across the playa
we watch as the sun crests the horizon and rises quickly across the sky
clouds whip past at incredible speeds time unfolding like a hallucinogenic until were faced with they sit parked on a bluff the emptiness making hicks eyes ache
a more desolate view couldnt be found in all of hell
walkin pete talked about this place said it
used to be really somethin
everythin growin green as a goddamn dollar bill
course we had to go and screw it up by poisonin everythin nothin pretty survives this world
nothin decent anyways
just wish i coulda seen it
priest pulls out a canteen of water takes a sip
hands it k to hicks
hows your arm
hiding it from him sore
cuts still open
as hicks hands the canteen back priest suddenly grabs his arm its completely healed
not even a scar
youre a halfbreed
a beat as hicks looks to the ground when he speaks its in a voice just below his breath
she was raped
nobody knows its recessive in my family
no light sensitivity
im not proud
but its a part of me
aint nothin i can do
looks at priest i woulda told you
just didnt want you treatin me no different
it hangs there
thesilence stretching like a rope then priest revs his cycle a flurry ofdust kicking up as he speeds away
hold on hicks eyes stinging he watches priest
finally he starts his bike following
priest inspects a tire tread in the sand a cluster of clouds gathering in the sky behind him
a pair of cracked black goggles half buried in the dust
the kind used by a motorcycle rider
hicks pulls a torn piece of clothing lucysdress
stashed in a rock crevice he holds it up to priest gunning his engine as we cut to
priest and hicks barreling through the dust
up ahead something materializes in the desert must be a mirage
hicks blinks cant believe his eyes
it looks abandoned
gotta be a desert rat
they park their bikes about twenty feet from the rickety structure hicks stepping off his bike and approaching
let me do the talkin
the sun has a way of cookin these peoples brains so they aint quite right bang
a rifle shot kicks up dust at hicks feet
hold it right there mistert hicks freezes
a beat as
the front of the shack shows only a doorway hidden in shadow
thenan old man emerges rifle in hand
he cocks it making a bead for hicks head
take another step and youll be meetin the lord directly
easy now old timer
im a sheriff
the old man snorts spitting a thick stream of tobacco
it sizzles when it hits the dust
aint no law out here but my own
calm and cool priest shifts in his seat drawing his gaze
seeing priest clearly now for the first time
praise the lord
total attitude adjustment
he lowers the rifle and smiles revealing a gap tooth smile wide enough to drive a herd of cattle through
a dusty phonograph playing a recording of an old time spiritual the record warped from the heat distorting the voice as the camera pans past hundreds of homemade crucifixes haphazardly
nailed across the wall
cleaned the place up a bit
been years since i had any kind of company sides jackrabbits but i knew you was comity dreams dont lie
ignoring hicks the old man pours black tea into a rusty can handing it to priest
most people dont remember what you folk done don t want to remember
but i do
i know what you can do
making the sign of the cross you are gods mighty sword fused into flesh
one of the chosen
touched by his very ha nd so peace could finally come to this cur sed land
sounds like a bunch of religious mumbo jumbo to me
the old man stares fixedly at priest
now you tell the clergy this here is an authentic miracle i want it registered
never seen so many loot souls breaks my heart just to think of it
this aint no place for nothin divine
the mans fevered belief unsettles priest hes unsure how to respond
you saw angels
sure as chit
dont know too many to count
some nights the sky was so thick you couldnt see the stars
his eyes suddenly light up remembering something
i old man contd here
look at this he goes to a shelf its been turned into a makeshift shrine rw ging through a jumbled collection of crucifixes yellowed photographs collected junk
he pulls out a glass jar containing something misshapen floating in murky water the old man proudly showing it to priest and hicks
what is it
its their spoor
theyd be flyin above and this stuff would drop from the sky like manna
thats angel shit
scooped it up myself
offering it to hicks you wanna hold it
hicks backs away shaking his head
priest still doesnt know what to make of the man but he senses something to be gained
he tries changing the subject
d you ever see them during the day
no i reckon
thats when theyd go back home for some shut eye gettin the world ready for the rapture takes a lot of work
the castle he points out the window far away atop a craggy peak sits the remains of a castle beautiful place
wonder of the world
i used to watch em every night takin to the sky in all of gods glory i never would disturb em though
gods children like their privacy
he winks smiling that crazy smile
priest considers the possibility of a lead here but hicks just gazes at the old man like hes nuts as we cut to the boys mounting up their bikes about
to head out
the old man approaches priest
i want you to have somethin before you go he presses a homemade cross into priests hand
its a real beauty flecked with colored stones
a lot of love and care went into this one
remember a man comes into this world with one thing
hes lucky if hes still got it when he leaves
priest pockets the cross revving his cycle and with a final nod he and hicks speed into the wasteland
the old man watches his cracked face squinting as the sun flashes off the metal of the machines
the vampire train shooting down the track blown tumbleweeds catching the scrub brush as it races by
lucy is on her knees scratching her nails against the wood floor
splintery shards come up in tiny clusters
the sound of a padlock opening a chain dropping to the floor
lucy quickly sits making innocent
a servant familiar enters carrying a tray of food his eyes grotesquely roam lucys body
lucy smiles sweetly taking the tray
the familiar turns to leave
whapi lucy slams the tray over his head and he collapses to the floor
she makes a run for it
but the familiar manages to grab her ankle
knocking her down she kicks at him as he holds fast hissing
two more familiars run in and grab her arms wrestling her to the floor
she struggles furiously but its no use she screams as we cut to a sad collection of crumbling stone walls and turrets
all the more surreal for rising up in the absolute nothing of the wasteland
priest and hicks stand surveying the ancient ruin
hicks cant help but laugh
truly a wonder of the world
good thing we listened to the fossil
dont know how wed find lucy without him
vampires sometimes use abandoned structures as a perch
looks at hicks watch for booby traps
and with that he enters the desert shrubs sprout like weeds between the stones once proud turrets rotting to dust everything bleached by the weather
whatever this place was the desert owns it now
why we listen to that crackpot
crazy fuckers so blinded by faith hes batahit
thats called a zealot in my
im startin to think you might be one yourself
you ever think bout that
priest doesnt respond squinting his eyes
at the opposite end of the courtyard is an opening
it leads into a chamber of some kind
walls rising high into a cone as sunlight streams in from an opening in the top
hicks and priest enter stepping carefully over piles of garbage littering the floor
this is bullshit
lucys been gone five days every stupid minute we waste here is a minute more she gets farther away
priest turns and sees a stone staircase uneven steps leading
too dark to tell where though
if anything comes up the steps that isnt me shoot it
before hicks can reply
priest heads down the stairs darkness swallowing him with every step
the air seems thicker here the darkness claustrophobic
it takes a moment for priests eyes to adjust
actually more a cave
miles and miles
twisting jagged and moist
endless corners weaving into a dark and hideous maze
priest heads into it frustrated hicks kicks at the garbage
theres something underneath
he brushes aside the refuse uncovering a
bunch of small white shapes breath catching as he realizes what it is bones
priest moves through the darkness footsteps not even a whisper heading deeper and deeper into the labyrinth as hicks is now at the chamber wall running his hand along it
feels grooves lining its surface
stepping back he sees they form an image of some kind
hard to make it out in the darkness
he leafs through the garbage pulling out a piece of broken
priest turns a jagged corner and looks down the longest most narrow tunnel yet
a light shines at the end
a shadow brushes past the light moving so fast it barely registers
could just be a trick of the eye
priest moves towards it
hicks angles the broken glass under the light reflecting a faint beam onto the wall revealing a huge carving cut into l z
i primitive but very creepy
we linger on the image the terror of the people the viciousness of the creature
just the low how of a breeze moving through the tunnel
priest walks into an animal pen of sorts a hay like substance covering the floor the smell of something bestial
he covers his nose looking around something in the corner catching his eye splayed across the ground like rag dolls
he crouches to take a closer look
barrels into him with superhuman force
acting on instinct priest folds and rolls
kicking the thing off him and pushing off the wall for a blistering recovery
whatever it is its fast
quickly countering for every move he gives neither able to get the upper hand
too dark to make out what it is
priest locks his arms around the shapes arms slab g it against the wall illuminating it under the torch light
o a beat as they stand staring at each other unsure what to say
the cross tattoo covers her face shadowing fierce eyes
every inch a warrior
time seems to stop for these two
their whole dark history their bend passing between them in one glance
how did you find me
priest doesnt reply
she narrows her eyes suspicious
did the clergy send you
why would they
she nods towards the bodies we now see tb re
vampirz ive been busy
off priests reaction we cut to hicks looking up to see the light from the hole in the geilingwinkinc out
the sun is setting
slipping he drops the piece og glass cutting his finger
he wipes the blood on his pants not noticing as a a large shape looms in the archway behind him
the two warriors eye each other the
air heavy between them
if you didnt come for me
why are you here
i should be asking you the same question
the bestial smell stings their nostrils smells good
theres another one around here somewhere
i dont know
but its not like the others
theyre interrupted by the sound of gunfire echoing off the tunnel walls
he starts down the tunnel
the priestess quickly following
hicks is sprawled at the base of the stairs bloodied and bruised
both guns pointed at something is lurking
a hulking shadow sounds like a rabid bull
we catch the tip of a claw scraping at the stone floor
priest approaches from down the tunnel senses on full alert
its too big to fit down here
thats why youre still alive
what the hell is that thing
i im not stupid
vampires dont look like that
they used to
the priestess steps out from behind priest
who the hell are you
she doesnt even bother to respond
just shooting a look as the two warriors bound charging into battle
priest bursts from the stairway leaping up and over as the priestess rolls off to the side
he lands beside her the two turning to face down a fearsome creature much more terrifying than the nightshade variety
bigger more ferocious
the ancient cousin to the more modern vampire
the beast opens its mouth and lets loose with a scream its breath vile
the priestess leaping to the stone wall and climbing up the rock
priest goes the opposite way rolling across the floor keeping low
with a screech goes for the priestess
crawling up the wall hunched like a rat talons ferociously
digging into rock
coordinating an attack wordlessly the priests make their move lets go of the wall plummeting straight towards the vampire the creature flashing its fangs in anticipation
leaps from below darting up the rock taking advantage of the distraction landing on the creatures back and wrapping his arms around its neck
going for the deathlock
with a shriek the creature whips its head with crack force sending priest flying
the priestess still in mid drop catches him and they both hit the ground with their feet
should we lead it into open air
more room to
better to keep it contained
the vampires lathered into an animal frenzy now wailing and scuttling around the circular wall in crazy patterns
suddenly with a stone shattering boom
it bursts through the hole flying out into the night
they race outside
the priests look up to find the vampire clawed around a turret shadowed in the moonlight
great leathery wings unfold from its back as it swoops low coming in for thekill
darts behind a boulder just in time
the creatures talons scraping at the rock before it soars back to the sky he pulls out his bible grabbing and tossing a handful of cutting through the air sparkling
in the moonlight beautiful
but they bounce harmlessly off the creatures wings knifing back to the ground imbedding deep in the stone priest having to nimbly dodge his own weaponry
the creature howls
blazing straight for him
priest looks at the priestess and folds his hands into the prayer position leveling his breath pulse slowing as the screaming beast bares down like a freight train
quickly scoops up two large rocks hurtling them towards the vampire
her eyes lock with priests as she too folds her hand into the prayer position
ry azng goes black silence
the sound of a heartbeat
the juncture between instants
a bright flash we see priest leaping through the air everything around him frozen the creature the rocks the priestess
a bright flash again and now priest is using the frozen rocks as steps launching his body until he is above the i i m
q a bright flash again and now priest is on the behemoth he pulls out the familiars knife twirling it in his hand everything goes blacx and wham we fuse
back into real time as the creature crashes to the ground
its decapitated head rolling to a stop face frozen in a horrible rictus
as the world seems to hold its breath then priest lands in a crouch dropping next to the priestess her hands still locked in the prayer position
she turns to him
suddenly the creatures body erupts into ablistering death spasm
talons clacking like straight razors flailing dangerously close to the two of them
a single bullet
pierces its heart and the body collapses with a thud
once and for all dead
angle on hicks in the archway smoke coming off his gun
he looks at the priests
meet point fuckin b
he smiles twirling his six shooters back into their holsters
hicks examining the fallen creature poking at the carcass with his gun
in some crazy distant way hes related to this thing
he raises his hand comparing it to the beasts talon
shakes his head
priest and the priestess stare out at the wasteland uncomfortable with looking at each other
this was a pureblood
we both know thats impossible they havent existed for a millennium
whats going on here
i dont know
a beat filled with awkward silence when the priestess kti speaks it comes as a relief for both
an unloosening of things long held tight
sector seven was the only place i could find work
nobody else would hire me
no applicable skills
i heard that one too
a week ago a family camping out on the perimeter approached me
told me vampires were terrorizing their village and that the government wouldnt do anything about it
did you go to the clergy
they wouldnt see me
by the time i got to the village it was completely razed
they didnt even bother to feed
ive been on their trail ever since
could be the same group who took your niece
the priestess glances towards hicks
does the lawman know what youll do if you find her
hell try to stop you
he wont be able to
she pauses a moment regarding him
you know some nights i still dream were back on the frontlines
i wake up im sweating
my muscles all clenched like im ready for something but i dont know what
nights like that
i dont go back to sleep
but on other nights
the good nights i dream about other things
priest stares at her not sure what to say
lucky for him the moment gets interrupted by
shouting from below hey
you guys better get a look at thisl the warriors lock eyes knowing somethings been started but
unsure of what
they head down the stone steps
hicks is lifting up one of the creatures wings
theres some sort of black mark on its skin
it must be a birthmark of some kind
that aint no birthmark its a brand
the priestess studies the mark something about it making her skin crawl
maybe because its intheshape of a top hat
theres something else you need to see
carrying a torch the priestess
leads priest and hicks through the maze the deeper they go the more subterranean it feels
bowels of the earth
i found this just before i was attacked huge
our group appearing as tiny shapes set against the awesome scale of the place
hundreds of large holes gouged into the walls stretching as far as torchlight allows
an incredible sight
its a tomb
big enough for an army
guess theyre not as endangered as everyone thought
but whered they go
we hear a loud shriek and a massive swarm of bats sweep through the depths of the chamber black wings fluttering
only one way to find out
our group moving deeper into the dark cavern a moan of wind echoing off the gorge wail behind them massive black stalactites hanging overhead
they move quickly priest ahead of the other two
hicks gazes at the priestess admiring her body
any man would
he works up his courage and approaches her
are priests allowed to you know
we take a vow of celibacy at inception
hicks cant be sure did she just look at priest when she said that
i was uh wondering
how did he do that little stunt back there
all priests can do it
so whats the trick
you just have to remember
time is relative
priest snaps up his hand cutting off their conversation something strange up ahead he slowly moves forward the tunnel sharply dropping feeding into a not like the cave this is
like the inside of a wasp nest curved walls made of dirt and spit priest covering his nose and mouth as hes hit with a massive stench
looms before him we dont see what it is
as the priestess and hicks enter the chamber hicks coughs reeling from the smell the priestess wrapping a cloth around her mouth the camera focusing only on theirexpressions as they
take in the horrible spectacle before them
you said the next nearest town was jericho
then we better go see
what they left of it
push in on hicks knots of rope tightening in his stomach
only now realizing how truly black the path before him will be
the night train thundering across the rails almost obscene in the bright sunlight
an intruder from the darkness we hear a scratching sound something scraping
heavy breathing as we move into
the servant familiar slides the door open carrying food for lucy no tray this time
but shes not there
he screeches dropping the food as he runs to a hole ripped in the wood floor smatterings of blood around the edges
its not very big just enough for a small body to fit through
the familiar sticks his head through the opening and clack past at a furious speed inches from his head
the noise is deafening
the familiar turns lucys perched inside one of the joists lining the underside of the train
kracki she lets loose with a well placed kick snapping his head back so he catches on the track
with ascream hes quickly sucked out the train pulverized on the track
lucys covers her mouth her nails an ugly bloody mass
shes come this far time to go the rest
she manages to carefully crawl from joist to joist moving along the underside of the train her body just centimeters from the passing track
catching herself just in time
her eyelids practically brushing the wood
taking a deep breath she manages to hoist herself through the rest of the way finally making it to the caboose
she pulls herself up onto the back of the car
the train is blazing past the wasteland at an incredible speed
only one thing to do
she makes the sign of the cross closes her eyes and jumps a dustorm
the plains a shifting veil of sand parting to reveal a vista of dunes wind shipping across them
as quickly as it opened the veil closes again shifting to reveal our trio plowing through blast goggles and respirators covering their faces
the priestess riding a cycle identical to priests
in the distance we can make out a cluster of structures as they arrive at jericho
riding into town
the storm making it difficult to see anything as they idle onto main street
its deserted the only sound a saloon door creaking noisily in the wind
ominous signs left in the vampires wake are everywhere we separate
go through each building see what we find
ill start with the sheriff
just because its daylight doesnt mean its safe
hicks nods tightening the twin bandoleers across his chest
everything is eerily quiet just the sound of the wind
hicks crouches just outside the door examining spent shell casings littering the walkway
he pulls out his six shooter pushing the door open with his gun stepping inside the place is a mess
dust blown in from the storm covers everything broken furniture scattered everywhere glass littering the floor
whatever went down here someone put up a hell of a fight
he shakes his head heading towards the holding area as
the priestess walks in flurries of yellow dust swirling in her wake filling the room
if the jail was a disaster zone this place is just plain creepy
red sofas red curtains hell even red wine
everything set up for a great time
just no people
a piano sits nestled in the corner she walks to it and runs her finger across the dust covered keys
it comes up wet and red
the plinking keys playing by themselves activated by pneumatic pegs on a rotating paper roll filling the lonely room with tin pan music
the sound of a record skipping
priest steps through a doorway the door already ripped off its hinges
broken furniture and glass
its obvious a family lived here childrens clothes and wooden toys messily strewn across the floor
he walks to an old phonograph sitting on the windowsill still playing placing the needle back in its cradle
thats when so thing out the window ratchgo hiseve
hicks done searching meets up with the priestess in the middle of the street hes pretty disturbed
wind howling around him
there aint nobody left
too many mouths to feed
but the priestesss already focused on something else gazing at something behind the general store
he turns to see what it is
on the ground kneeling
head down engaging in some kind of prayer
the camera follows as they slowly approach wondering what the hell is going on
as they get closer they see the full before priest are three large wooden crosses a naked body on each crucified
because of the swirling sand its hard to make out their faces but its obvious the poor souls are already dead
immediately the priestess drops beside priest joining him and it is only now that we get a good look at the crucifieds theyre priests
bare feet running on the salt flats
covered in dirt battered and bruised but chugging along
there is absolutely nothing out here only it wears a black coat fluttering in the wind as it touches down the fabric cascading across the earth in long dark folds
the figures face is completely covered by a black cowboy hat
the only thing we can see is a cheroot sticking out from where the mouth would be
a brief moment as the tip of the cigar glows a puff of smoke exhaled
it drops to the ground silver spurs making a slight ching sound as a black boot stamps it out
lucy hears the sound and turns just in time to see y i athick chain shooting out from within the fiaure coat
a huge metal fingered claw at use
the claw slams into lucy thick fingers clamping around her knocking her to
she digs her nails into the earth but its no use as the chain drags her backwards and she quickly disappears into the coat with a scream
the folds enveloping her in a dark embrace
in one graceful sweep the black figure leaps to the sky
we see the cheroot on the ground
the only evidence that anyone or anything was ever out here at all
caught between sheets of swirling dust and
sand the images like hallucinations moments of ritual and grief a
the crucified priests taken down from their crosses their naked bodies like ragdolls
the corpses now wrapped in white cloth carefully placed amongst the makeshift pyre
flames engulfing the bodies a twisty column of smoke rising the sun and clouds painting the sky pink and gold
our trio stands before the pyre gazing into the fire it pops consuming more of the bodies if the priests listen close enough they can hear the end of an
dont make no sense
what were they doin out here
the same thing as us
someones drawing us out
the priests just stare into the fire not having any idea
i imagine youll have to go back to the cities inform the clergy
a sudden silence
were not going back
the priestess looks at him he speaks for her as well but shes still shocked to hear the words out loud
a lifetime of conditioning
well burn for this
looking at the pyre we already are
something in the flames catches the priestesss eye in the charred remains of one of the corpses somethings glowing
she wraps her arm plunging her hand through the bones pulling out the object
quickly she tosses it into abarrel of water
it hisses steam rising as it cools
priest reaches into the barrel his hand emerging with a its a railroad spike
my pop used to work boxcars before they shut down why the hell would anyone wanna swallow that
a beat as priest puts it together
he wanted us to find it
its a clue
wheres the closest track
hicks pulls a large map off the wall blowing off a layer of dust drawing a line across the paper with his finger
the dunkirk line
it starts all the way in the backcountry bought the ore from the deep mines
there were about five stops along the route
he draws several xs along the line
his hand coming to a stop on a particular forboding patch of mountains
looks like jericho was the last town it glances before
heading around the linwood mountains
then it goes to the last stop
he draws one final x at the end of the line
so there it is
the priestess narrows her eyes
they must have been picking up different factions along the way
moving during the day feeding at night
but headin to the cities is suicide
the sun will kill em theres nowhere to hide
priest gazes at the map deeply troubled
they wont have to
and with the shriek of the train whistle we cut to the night train barreling down the track blasting along on its grim trajectory
suddenly overtakes the train
snaking along the rail at an incredible speed leaving the train in its tracks sorry as it blisters across the wasteland through craggy mountains and finally ending up in and
it is only now that we see exactly what priest means
thick cloud of industrial smoke covers the metropolis
there is no sun
a black cowboy hat coolly tilted down exposing
a cheroot clutched between thin lips
a trail of smoke lazily floats upwards
a fine catch yes
the voice is oily a dark shed be dead if not for me
swallowed by the wasteland
we see lucy on the floor at the figures feet his pale hand runs calmly through her hair
from the shadows black hat steps forward looking down at lucy
she struggles but the hand tightens its grip
what do you want for her
and now her captor lifts his hat revealing paper thin skin eyes like black coal
this is rune a bounty hunter
you know what r want
black hats eyes flick upwards glinting in the
go too far rune
he comes for her still
of course he does
let me have him
rune smiles revealing an impressive set of vampire fangs
im sure shell fetch a nice price out in the zone they dont care what condition their meats in
as long as its easy to chew
black hat eyes him
dont get involved in this
i was involved long before you showed up
ive been waiting years for a chance at him
and now that hes here i find x have to ask a prime permission
like a snake a finger of the claw emerges from the folds of his jacket wrapping itself around lucys neck
my how things have changed
ever so slightly the metal finger squeezes lucys throat choking her
i never cared about your war
never got involved
we were exiles rejected by both humans and vampires
all we wanted was a quiet place
but he wiped out my whole tribe
maybe its time to return the favor
the metal finger wraps tightetr lucy gasps the tension becoming unbearable until finally fine
as if on command the finger retreats back into the jacket lucy collapsing to the floor coughing and choking
and shes yours
he laughs sounds like a death rattle dropping the cigar to the floor spurs chiming as he walks out the car door long dark coat fluttering behind him disappearing into
annoyed picks up the still burning cigar squeezing it in his hand
he turns to lucy
and as for you uy dear
youre more trouble than i anticipated
must be your uncles blood in you
a shame hell never see what youll become
i wouldve loved to see his face
and then he is upon her saliva mixing with blood as he drinks
roar our trio plow through the scrubby desert growth chewing up the dirt
the blood of their machines at full boil
the vampire train chugging along on its dark course heading for the cities
i ourcrew hellbent on stopping em
the two locked on a fated path blurring across the landscape as the sun crests across the sky dissolving into twilight
hicks and the two priests ride past tumbleweed drifts the surrounding desertscape golden in the fading light
ahead a forboding series of craggy mountains awaits a winding trail criss crossing through the peaks
they stop their machines idling next to each other taking stock of the huge task beaore them
it aint gonna be easy
as if on cue the last rays of the sun wink out behind the mountain
headlight crossbeams leading the way their cycles navigate the twisty trail cutting across sheer canyon walls teetering on the brink of an abyss rock slides a constant threat
theyve set up camp for the night on the lip of a ridge
hicks and the priestess sit by a fire dunking their feet in a nearby stream the wear and tear of their journey evident on the sheriffs face
priest lies close by asleep
if we push it hard well gain two days on em
should be enough to get us a jump
weneed more than a jump
we need a miracle
thats the funny thing about time he dips his hand in the water and raises it letting the liquid leak from between his fingers
its always runin right through my fingers
you should try harder sheriff
she cups her hand in the water bringing it to her lips for a drink
hicks smiles leaning forward something on his mind
you ever regret it
bein a priest
what about a husband children
ive had a family just not the kind youre familiar with
hicks glances at priest
you mean mr
laffs over there
hes not so bad once you get to know him
a beat hicks expression becoming serious
hes going to kill her isnt he
theres things that can be done
she doesnt have to die
shes his bloodline
and hes a priest
its the only way
hicks tosses the rest of his food into the fire troubled but he knows theres no point in discussing it any further
and how many of you priests are left now
a long moment before she speaks
hicks doesnt know what to say im sorry
she nods though in affirmation of what hickss isnt sure
he watches her as she staresinto the fire
we fade to black its dark
a group of priests our two amongst them move silently through a deep trench moist earthen walls rising around them the air putrid with stink mud clinging to their feet
last in the line is a particularly fearsome priest
unlike the others hes smiling enjoying the action
as a cohesive unit the priests climb up from the trench scaling through the muck
they find themselves at the base of the hive looking around at a chilling sight stretching endlessly rising high above in a cone
thousands our priest motions with his hand to the others giving precise instructions their movements well coordinated
hearing a sound
a faint but incr
a beat as the priestess looks at the others
they know were here
from under the earth a hand shoots up grabbing onto a priests leg pulling him down
suddenly dozens of vampires emerge seemingly birthed from the soil
the warriors fight valiantly
but its too much
most are quickly cut down
battles like a tiger grappling with two vampires their claws at his throat fangs inches from his face
a couple of quick moves and before you realize how the vanires lay dead
he quickly joins the surviving priests as they run through the hive a dizzying maze of muddy tunnels and trenches
a black top hat lying on the ground catching his eye must be the last remanent of a dandy gentleman
he picks it up admiring the souvenir
puts it on his head
the priestess races by shooting him a we dont have time for this look
he stops her grabbing her shoulder
what do you think am i a dapper dan
she glares running ahead to join the group
fearsome just smiles taking off the hat
from within the hive comes a mighty shriek and now fearsome starts to run trying to catch the others as they scramble for daylight
the exit just in sight
at the last second hes pulled back by a clutch of screeching hungry claws
the hat still gripped tightly in his hand as hes dragged away
our two priests reach for him but its too late
he disappears into the darkness as we cut back to priest waking up breath catching in his throat
he looks over to find the priestess working on her cycle unable to sleep
theres a tension in the air the sense of something about to break as he joins her
why would the clergy forbid us from seeing each other
maybe they were scared of what we could do
or what we would do
we both know theres something inside the order thats off
even if we dont know what it is
with or without the clergy
were still priests
and were the only ones who can stop that train
if we survive this we need to expose them for what they are
we won t survive this
she puts down her tools staring fixedly at him
you scared to die
i believed in heaven my whole life
believed everything we were taught and now
when its finally my time
no more faith
they took it away from me
priest gazes at her trying his best to be comforting
wherever it is we go
well go together
exact moment something inside priest shifts just a little bit a door opens never to be shut again
what in greater than god but more evil than the devil
the poor have it the rich need it and if you eat it
its a riddle
the priestess thinks about it
thats the answer
nothing is greater than god
nothing is more evil than the devil
the poor have nothing the rich need nothing
and if you eat nothing
its said that warriors can become close friends only when they see each others hearts priest now knows this to be true
what you said before
about those nights when you were dreaming of me the good nights
the good nights
do you think maybe tonight
could be one of those nights
and then priest does the most amazing thing
he smiles back
things happen fast he finds himself planting his mouth on hers
the years of conditioning all the ritual and tradition falling away in a flash
and it is here together in this place where they feel like they finally truly belong
the last two
a blanket of mist covers everything in a grey haze
morning has come
as our trio forges onward and upward the trail more treacherous with every twisty ridge the overhangs looming ominously as they head deeper into the mountain
the final climb
yawning crevices the wind moaning as it whistles between the canyon walls
carefully they ride across devils bridge a finger of stone just wide enough for the cycles on either side a straight drop to oblivion
the peak of the mountain just ahead
the priestess is in front leading the charge closely followed by hicks
priest brings up the rear he stops just past the bridge looks around
i ee itl hicks points reaching the top of the mountain
a long black line snakes along the rail puffs of heavy smoke lining its path the night train
theyre ahead of it
in his excitement hicks thunders ahead starting the descent down the other side
the priestess turns to shout back to priest
but hes gone
off her reaction we cut to tall rock walls flank priest on
either side the surrounding mist hanging in the air in cloudlike wisps
slowly he walks through the canyon senses fully attuned
i know youre there
a slight sound the mist whipping into a pool as if something just moved through it
priest quickly turns but theres nothing there
tumble down the cliff
again priest abruptly turns but
still nothing there
a beat as he stands in the ether waiting
qurye m onen
ieadjna straight for pi
just in time he dives the claw biting into a rock behind him the chain quickly snapping back disappearing into the fog
voice like the mist itself ive waited a long time for this priest
this isnt the time to settle old scores rune
this is the perfer time
like lightning the claw lashes out appearing from
priest jumps and it chomps into the ground where he was standing
he lands on top of the chain backflipping as it retracts back
gearing up for another attack
contd youve lost a step priest
i never came this close before
im older now
we can almost bear rune smile
and now the chain comes from a different direction wrapping around priest like a snake the metal cutting into his body snapping a ribt yelling priest grabs the chain pulling
with everything hes got
rune flies from the mist dragged by priest crashing at his feet
the chain snaps and priest breaks from the coils grabbing rune by the jacket picking him up
rune flashes his fangs and scissors his legs across priests stomach the razor sharp roweled spurs slicing his flesh tearing the muscle priest screams a hot rush of blood staining
the desert floor
rune leaps away landing ontop a boulder
you cant outrun the past priest
the things you did
it was a war rune
it still is he launches at priest duster fluttering like wings
the two grapple runes fangs brushing priests neck
its a savage battle priests muscles and laser like focus the only thing keeping him alive as rune flies back across the canyon landing against the rock wall like
hunched ready to strike but appears from within the mist already in mid leap she lands beside priest
the two together a formidable presence
but runes a tough customer he readies himself for another attack
ough h mist a single clicking sound
rune looks over sees six shooter pointed right at him
a beat as the two sides stare at each other in standoff
the air between them vibrating with energy
rune considering his options
another time priest
he skitters up the rock face disappearing into the mist
hicks fires a single shot the echo ringing through the canyon
drops from the fog hitting the ground with a thud
and now hicks turns points his revolver at priest
catching both he and the priestess by surprise
tell me you wont kill her
priest doesnt reply
or ill shoot you where you stand
finally showing your true colors
the priestess looks at hicks
whats he talking about
hes a halfbreed
hicks cocks the gun
dont turn this into somethin its not
youve been itching to do this since nightshade
shes your kin goddamit
if shes turned
shes nobodys kin
things can be done
things to lessen the thirst
she can have a normal life she doesnt have to die
priest nods grimly
its our way
and what is that
some special priest code of honor
you dont get it
your way its over
shoot me and it wont matter if you find lucy
you wont stop that train and you wont save her
the priestess steps between them looks at hicks
we need to be together on this
its the only shot we have
hicks thinks about it knows shes right
a tense beat then this aint done
he lowers his gun and walks away
the two warriors stand together the priestess gazing at priest
hedoesnt return it
without a word he heads back to his cycle
she doesnt see as his hand touches his stomach
it comes up red
the trio blast down the rock face descending down the mountain at a furious clip
the priestess looks at the train off in the distance its now much closer passing the mountain
theyve lost their edge
he guns the throttle and his bike blazes forward wheels thundering across the earth the roar of engines filling our head becoming the mad clatter of the train as it
barrels down the tracks
the assault begins
our trio finishes their descent blasting onto the wheels kicking up sheets of sand and grit spattering their faces
the train dead in their sites
you think they see us
as if in response the locomotive belches a thick cloud of black smoke a door sliding open from one of the cars
a beat as everyone holds their breath wondering whats going to emerge six black motorcycles the same ones who kidnapped lucy fly out from within the car
vampires covered in rider leather protected from the sun heads obscured by blast helmets
priest turns to the other two
make sure you get on that train ill catch up
before they can respond he banks his cycle to the left
take the bait going for priest
they gun their cycles engines
whining as they rev forward their leader unleashing a chain swirling it above his head
with a snap he lashes it at priest the chain catching in his wheel the sound of metal grinding as is thrown
his beloved bike flipping across the desert in wild arcs
he hits the earth with a painful skid using the momentum to roll back onto his feet
he checks his stomach the wounds of enina t g xnora staining his shirt bright red
no time for first aid as he turns just in time to see throwing a steel chain to the other pulling the line taut ready to take him out
at the last second ducks grabbing onto
the chain swinging himself around in a graceful arc and kicking his legs into a split
his feet slam the two cyclists off their bikes and into the dirt
he lands back on the ground in a crouch the steel chain tight in his grip ready for battle
and he gets it
circle priest surrounding him the roar of their engines like massive power drills
snaps the chain above his head bullwhip style lashing out
the sound of metal shredding as it tangles in rider s handlebars the bike sweeping into the other crashing in a tangled mess
with a snarl the fallen riders launch at priest
these vampires are different than the nightshade tribe
squat bodies of clenched muscles and fangs
spinning twisting kicking gnashing
bodies locked in deep combat as priest fends off the ferocious attackers
war cries whooping the others two riders continue to circle the gladiators dust kicking from their wheels
rips the blast helmets off his two attackers
with a screech their faces burn bodies instantly slackening in the harsh sun
priest crunches a vampire in the ribs knocking the creature off his bike
in a flash he flings
a helmet into the housing of the last cycle the bike nosedives sending the rider across the desert
eyes brimming with renewed fury priest picks up the cycle vroooomi
gunning the throttle mod
rocketing towards the train
hicks and the priestess are riding right beside the colossus the sound incredible as the cars rattle across the tracks
carefully they pull up to the caboose
shouting to be heard you ready
hicks nods maneuvering to the side of his bike and jumping to the priestesss his cycle crashing into the dirt as he leaps onto the back of the train
im going for the engine
about to speed off stops before he does
hicks nods knowing thisll probably be the last time he sees her
and with that she throttles forward disappearing
alone hicks takes a deep breath looks at who knows what horrors lie behind it
he pops a wad of atomic craw in his mouth and pulls his six shooters
tuxn now priest
bami he kicks the door in sunlight bursts into the darkened chamber but only reaching so far as if the sun itself were scared to enter
hicks rolls in guns at the ready
it takes a moment for his eyes to adjust but when they do he finds a series of old wooden coffins stacked atop one another like cargo
he quickly moves through the car careful not to disturb anything
we follow with him as he exits entering designed so one can move between the cars without exposure to the sun making the train a world of eternal midnight
carefully hicks opens the next compartments door
its pitch black
the only thing we can make out is a large cage whats inside impossible to see in the darkness just a giant hulking c shadow
its steady hefty breathing letting us know whatever it is its asleep
hicks covers his nose from the bestial smell the cage taking up so much room he is forced to press himself against the bars his body just inches from the
makes hicks stop in his tracks silently praying to whoevers listening
a long moment
and then the steady breathing begins again
hicks continues through the cabin finally making it to the door as the priestess engine at full boil makes her way up the train eyes on the engine up ahead
a long line of tiny slats open up rifle barrels quickly emerging snapping into place with a click
the guns fire away bullets blasting all around the priestess missing her by millimeters
she flicks down a toggle switch theres a mighty roar a massive surge of power and whoosh
she rockets forward
the bullets chewing up the dirt behind her
seemingly from out of nowhere motors up to the train car riding the vampire cycle
he grabs onto a gun barrel and swings into an arc lifting himself off the bike and lands on the roof of the train
the cycle quickly ripped apart as it falls under the juggernaut getting crushed sparks flying off the rails
priest collapses against the metal the strain beginning to wear he blinks up at the sky close to passing out
suddenly a figure steps in front of him blotting out the sun
priest squints unable to trust his eyes he must be its black hat
he looks down at priest bowing with a slight flourish
and the third day he shall rise again
priest cant believe it seeing his long dead comrade his face etched with shock all he can do is ask how
black hat smiles baring hi fangs
oh ye of little faith
the understanding hits priest immediately crashing over him like a wave
they turned you
i turned them
he smiles wider as we crosscut to hicks still hunting for lucy making his way to the next car
he slides open the door stepping carefully inside candlelight softly illuminating the space
hes greeted by a sight that makes his blood freeze long black boxes lined in orderly rows flickering light bouncing warmly off their mahogany casings the sound of deep tortured
breathing lets us know the occupants are asleep
under his breath shit
gritting his teeth he walks between the rows quiet as possible
the interiors of the coffins are dark hard to see whats lying inside just that horrible breathing sound
as hicks moves past his body brushes the wood the space so very tight
the train catches the rail and the car shakes knocking him into a coffin
holding his breath
but nothing happens
a quick hail mary the man becoming more of a convert with every step and he continues on
he doesnt notice as behind hi a px rises from one of the coffins priest and black hat eye each other landscape whipping past at a furious rate the train
blasting along the tracks
lost souls abandoned by divinity
no belief no voice to guide them through the wilderness
priest doesnt reply warily eyeing him
lack of faith
thats what i found in my new brethren and so it was i discovered my true calling to teach
by murdering innocents
by drawing a once great race back to their nature
by helping them discover the mastery within themselves
by putting them in touch with a higher power
something in the distance catches priests eye a black spec on the horizon its the cities
his jaw tightens he knows there isnt much time
so this is how you go about it
one by one killing every last remaining priest
it was the only way
the cities are defenseless now
no one left to stop us from entering our eden
but i was kind i gave every last one the choice i never had
now its your turn
almost imperceptibly the two make a shift in their postures the tension between the two warming up
two warriors steeling for a fight
its better to be with your enemies than to be alone priest
humanity had its chance
its time to make way for new blood
priest lowers his head when he raises it his reply comes easy and without hesitation
molecules and electrons bursting from their orbits the roar of the train gently subsiding as if the universe itself wants to leave these two room to battle
and before anyone knows it theyre already mid fight
the slam and collision of bodies giving way to the graceful sweep and echo of priest combat
then as combustibly fast as it started the tableau drops
they stand wind whipping around them in lethal currents black hat having to shout to be heard
they taught us god created man in his image
but they lied
man created god in a image and so like man god is weak
he wipes away a streak of blood from his cheek
who do you fight for priest
the orders collapsed
the church nothing but a line of decrepit ruined old men
how do you think im getting into the cities
priests face drops
i dont believe you
your faith has failed you priest
join me and have the best of both worlds walk in the sun
stalk in the night
why pray to a god when you can be one
with ferocious instinct he launches forward feet digging into the metal
the two bodies collide w th mic impact
rolling across the roof bodies twisting to the edge before flipping onto the next car
the warriors rise locked in a furious coil
as whooshi train car after train car passes beneath them
each leaping at j ust the right moment to land onto the next
but priest is outmatched
as they hit the final car priest flies across the roof catching the edge with his hand just before he goes over his body dangling over the side
exhausted and bloodied
black hat calmly approaches his foot dangerously close to priests hand
the landscape below whipping past at an incredible speed
your problem is you keep looking to god for your power but i know the real truth
youve been praying to an empty sky
and now he swipes his foot across the roof knocking off priests hand as one would swat a bug
priest falls below getting caught under the train and quickly dragged under
but you know that now
the priestess cycle at full throttle racing beside the train engine
up close its a real mechanical monster black metal and heat fused into a superpowered nightmare
the hull completely covered
pump up and down furiously moving so fast they blur turning the giant drive wheels that power the locomotive
angry blasts of steam vent whi te hot from between the wheels just missing the priestess
she reaches into her pack and lugs out a crowbar pulling up to the beast and managing to stick it between the pistons hoping to jam up the works
the machine chews it up like candy
hicks is almost at the door hand reaching for the handle
he hears a rustling sound and turns to look behind him
but theres nothing just the open coffins
turning back hicks catches his breath
a vampire hangs upside down from the ceiling blocking the door
its red eyes snap in anticipation a shiny black proboscis darting from its mouth
hicks spits a wad of atomic craw at the creature
it rieksi dropping to the floor writhing
the sick smell of cooked flesh filling the car
dozens of vampires are now awake
sitting up in their coffins the foul creatures all blood eyeing hicks like the dinner he most surely is
with a wail the vampires quickly scramble from their coffins sharp talons scratching at the wood snapping the planks
desperate he wrenches open the door darting into and manages to slam the door behind him just in time as the hungry beings crash against itl he wedges a knife
in the door handle bashing it with his revolver jamming the door trapped shut
he turns to head to the next car but theres a thick chain and padlock wrapped around the door awild eyed familiar peering out from inside the door window
hicks shoots the padlock but no luck it doesnt break
but not for long
priest is still alive
he hangs in tatters desperately clinging to the undercarriage face and body punched with bruises and blood
jaw set he begins to move through the undercarriage hand over hand every movement sheer agony
hicks stares at the door as it starts to break from its hinges
he trains his gun on it a feeble gesture but its all hes got left
then theres a horrible screech
the wild eyed familiar charges attacking from behind having unlocked the chain and opened the door
he screams sinking a knife in hicks side
hicks spins slamming his attacker in the nose with a palm heel strike knocking the familiar out instantly
hicks pulls the knife out blood flowering across his shirt as the vampires continue to pummel the door behind him
he trips over the chain and staggers into collapsing to the floor he presses his body against the door to close it
absolutely nothing in here
a single candle burns on the floor dimly illuminating the room
weakly he crosses the space and goes to the next door
this ones got a thick padlock too
he site on the floor breathing hard knowing this is as far as he goes
gradually another sound becomes audible
hicks listens nervous
he holds his breath straining to hear
its someone elses breathing
a hunched figure sits
its back to him
hicks levels his gun slowly moving towards the shape the candlelight giving him a glimpse of its face
he can hardly believe it
thats when he sees something
glinting in the darkness just below her lip
howling across the wasteland the train now racing even faster furnace cranking out flame like dantes inferno the priestess furiously keeping pace with the engine desperately looking for a way
there is none
she looks up ahead
smudged like a greasestain looms large across the horizon right in the trains path
she squints up to the sky analyzing the sun making a quick series of calculationsin her head
then she looks at the train
she flicks the nitros toggle one last time
her bike rockets past the train engine speeding into a curtain of dust
hicks crouches beside lucy his gun trained on her
she site listlessly her skin pale eyes lost on the wall in front of her
lucy my name is sheriff hicks
im here to take you home
she seems almost catatonic
he reaches into his pocket pulling out her photograph showing it to her
im here with your uncle
that gets her attention she looks at hicks and she looks scared
the car door outside finally starts to give freely metal breaking open
the sound of squealing vampires
hicks runs to
the car door in one quick motion scooping up the chain and wrapping it around the handle tying it tight just as reaches through the opening long bony fingers swiping
at hicks like switchblades as he falls backwards pain shooting up his body
another arm breaks through the small window clawing at the air the door banging repeatedly against the chain
hicks places himself between lucy and the door not noticing as she eyes the blood soaking through his shirt
stay behind me
ill hold em off as long as i can blami bl
hicks fires bullets peppering the creatures as they howl but they keep at it the thick chain stretched tight ready to snap
manages to scramble through it charges at hicks fangs glistening
bami with a twitch it collapses in a heap a well placed bullet between the eyes
a massive gate not opened for decades slowly grinds open a complex series of chains and winches scraping to life
the cities now open to the approaching vampire train
the scream of the whistle like victory as the locomotive approaches the city limits sending up a giant plume of billowing steam
the sky above already starting to cloud black as hicks continues to fire the vampires seconds from entering the car
he turns to look back at lucy
but shes gone
plank slams him over the head knocking the gun from his hand
woozy he spins around to find lucy standing over him holding the plank above her head
he scoots back just as wham
the plank comes back down again splintering apart across the floor
lucy wait she doesnt jabbing at him with the broken plank he dodges it barely but she keeps coming
lucy dont do this
the girls just too fast
she keeps pushing him backwards until hes dangerously close to the vampires clawing hands
hicks closes his eyes knowing this is it
punches through a boarded up hole in the floor the one through which lucy escaped before wood splintering into tiny shards
hicks takes advantage of the distraction and slugs lucy knocking her unconscious
he dives for his gun scooping it up and leveling it at the hole ready to fire at whatevers coming through
he sticks his head through the opening having been drawn by the sound of gunfire
hicks cant believe it
reaching for lucy give her to me
hicks thinks about it unsure
get through the door any second
give her to mei screeching another vampire makes it through the opening hicks quickly taking him down in one crack shot
he picks lucy up handing her to priest
priest disappears with her hicks climbing down behind just as the chain finally snaps and the door bursts open with screeching vampires
hicks blasts away but theres too many of them they keep coming
he drops into the hole landing in the undercarriage
coming face to face with the speeding track everything shaking like an earthquake
jabs its head through the hole teeth chattering but the creature cant go any further the sunlight already making its skin smoke
on his back hicks worms his way down
as they climb up a ladder attached to the side of the train
they work their way up the side making it to the roof exhausted
priest carrying the still unconscious lucy
we should jump
not until we stop the trains but now hicks isnt even looking at him his attention caught up in the horrible sight waiting ahead of them
t towers above as the train approaches so close the smell of sulphur and carbon clogs their noses
but thats when something catches hicks eye
up ahead on the tracks someone stands
awaiting the train
its the priestess standing defiant as the train barrels towards her
an ant in front of a battleship
she sees hicks and priest on top of the train lucy with them
taking one last look at priest she smiles
and spreads her arms open
horrified realizing what shes going to do
and powerless to stop her
what happens next happens fast priest grabs hicks folding his body around both he and lucy hands coming together in prayer feet leaving the train as e eryth ggas black
the sound of a heartbeat
a zone of transition
a bright flash we see the train collide with the
the massive grill of the engine crumpling around her as if smashing into a building
she doesnt move
a bright flash one by one the train cars slam into each other the cars jumping the rails
mmmm gqes black a bright flash and now priest is falling through the air his body shielding hicks and lucy train care skipping across the earth careening through the air
we fuse back into real time as train cars crash down sheets of dust clouding the sky in a roiling storm of debris and shrapnel until finally
it all comes to a stop
we move through the swirling sand until we find he stands bruised and bloody staring at the sky
a dazed hicks beside him lucy in his arms as she comes to
a horrendous screech fills the air
led by the purebloods hundreds of vampires fly out from within the broken cars taking to the sky in a massive black swarm tangling together in flowing shapes
then in one horrible instant they turn as if guided by an unseen hand flying towards the cities
sensing the blood that awaits
theyre gonna make it
the creatures arctowards the metropolis the city within priest studies the sky and all at once
no theyre not
punches through the teeming mass
a few rays at first but then more and more cracking through the black tide like shattered glass
hicks eyes widen witnessing an amazing eight as the vampires bodies collectively blacken and shrivel the swarm withering
quickly becoming nothing more than husks
floating black kites
hicks and priest stand surrounded by the epic destruction fire and smoke casting everything in a surreal haze
you knew they wouldnt make it
a long time before priest answers
he turns to the engine its grinning teeth grill caved in as if smashed by the very hand of god
lies before it
somehow not a scratch on her
but somethings wrong something inside her broken something elemental
she doesnt have much time
priest kneels beside her taking her hand
trying to be strong for her
do you want me to
priest lowers his head
the following having been spoken by him all too often
you shall wash me and i shall be made whiter than snow
glory be to the father and to the son and to the holy spirit
the words are heavy each harder than the next
as it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be
world without end
a figure escapes through the dust lurching towards the cities its black hat
sees him but chooses to stay with the priestess brushing the hair from her face
i wish we couldve had more time
she reaches up placing her hand on his chest
wherever it is we go we go together right
she smiles weakly
but priest can see shes scared
he gives her one last kiss cradling her body sand circling them as she draws her final breath
the sun setting on the horizon
a nearby pyre consumes the last of the priestess body as priest saddles up on a vampire bike the flames rising behind him
hicks approaches lucy huddled in a blanket shivering
the two men exchange a look the snap and flash of the fire reflecting in their eyes
when youre finished you know where to find me
a tense beat then priest guns the engine
hicks and lucy watching as he blazes towards the cities the sky above the color of hellfire
the sound of a choir
the soaring ethereal tones carrying us through the forest of brick smokestacks finally coming to rest on a giant cross atop a mosaic basillica the colored tiles black with ash
were back in clergy city
the place is packed every pew filled with shadows and light
a cabal of monsignors stand shrouded in white robes awaiting to be anointed by orelas
a private ceremony
a line of children kneel before the altar the monsignor raising the host offering communion
he suddenly stops his expression dropping as slowly makes his way down the aisle bruised and bloodied his very presence a direct affront to this place
a woman gasps somebody faints
orelas dips his hand in water touching a monsignors forehead
ecces agnes dei ecces qui tollit peccata mundi
everyone turns to see the massive chamber doors bursting inwards
the bodies of two guards skidding across the marble floor
a true force of nature now coming like the fourth horseman
grief and betrayal stoking his anger higher a blaze igniting behind his eyes
steps from the shadows
deep wounds line his face the cross tattoo now gouged and distorted with blood he smiles
im afraid youre too late priest
shed their robes revealing fresh bite marks on their necks
orelas new found fangs glint in the candlelight
and why shouldnt we live forever
were gods very voice
stands shell shocked the level of betrayal staggering
into him the two warriors going at it in a brutal battle the vampire raking his claws across priests face drawing blood
sends him sailing through the air black hat crashing into a collection of candle holders an ancient tapestry catching fire flames quickly spreading to the other fabrics the chamber erupting
in an orange blaze
bodies contorting in grotesque shapes as they become
black hat stands triumphant flames rising behind him
with them i can start anew
you cant stop it must be gods will
he flies across the room barreling into priest with everything hes got digging a hand into priests wound
i looked and beheld a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death
priest coughs up blood
black hat smiles wrapping a hand around priests
throat lifting him off the floor squeezing the life from him and all hell followed with him
he raises his head back ready to sink his teeth
priest too exhausted to fight back
this is it
prom a b breaks from the wall with a groan plummeting towards them
black hat stops his eyes snapping upward
at the last second wrenches himself from black hats grip tumbling
across the floor
whapi the cross s lm onto black hat pulverizing hi
chunks of glass and stone rain down around priest the chamber starting to collapse
diving he barely makes it out the rotunda
crashing down behind him
the monsignors lunge but priest manages to jam the doors shut locking them in
they bash against the door shrieking horribly the chamber now an oven
priest presses against the door it splinters all around him the terrible sound rising until finally it stops
he collapses making the sign of the cross
people stream out of the massive doorway stampeding down the stairs the giant structure enveloped in smoke and flame
priest looks up to find father koeppen
the old man staring at him
a lost soul
am i next
priest approaches koeppen closing his eyes ready for the blow he knows is to come
but priest only lifts the mans head studying his neck
and without a single word priest just walks away
when koeppen opens his eyes hes a new man a man absolved
with renewed energy he looks to the crowd around him
and for the first moment in a long time
people dont run
god is here for youl he wants you to stopi stop and ask yourself a question and the people do stop looking to him the panic leaving their eyes
ask yourselves where am i going
at this priest turns the question catching him as well
and its only now he realizes he has no answer
its rusty blades scrape along the metal catching the first rays of the day
aaron pace is already up working on rebuilding his house
he stops gazing off in the distance
two black specs riding it
hicks and lucy
dropping his tools he runs to meet it
time has passed
the moon shines through an open doorway
lucy lies in bed aaron spoon feeding her a warm broth
he smiles lucy reluctant to smile back still uncomfortable with her teeth
but eventually for her father
she manages it
leans against the backwall watching
lucy glances his way
then shyly looks away
i cant thank you enough for what youve done sheriff
just make sure she keeps on the tea
its a special brew lessens the bloodthirst
something my granddad taught me
aaron nods hopefully squeezing his
a full moon
hicks stands on the porch enjoying the breeze as he pops a wad of chaw in his mouth
a movement out in the darkness catches his attention
stands astride a motorcycle shadowed in the moonlight
hicks approaches the wind kicking up whistling through the emptiness
even though he cant see him hicks knows who it is
it doesnt have to be like this
priest just stands staring
hicks hand curls around the revolver
priest looks to the cabin the challenge hanging in the air he steps from the bike advancing towards hicks
hicks pulls his gun leveling it
priest keeps coming the wind blowing harder as he approaches
a feeling of inevitability
hicks stands his ground cocking his gun
d i t make dq this
stares into his eyes and something passes between them something so strong and personal it transcends emotion
but priest is pone
hicks looks around theres no sign of him not even the bike
he races back to the cabin
hicks bursts through the doorway finding
sitting peacefully on the bed together just as he left them
aaron holds up the cup turning it over
we heard you fire your gun
is everything ok
a beat then hicks nods
nothing to worry about just a coyote
aaron smiles happy enough to be with lucy
were all gods creatures
hicks turns ready to leave but something on the table catches his eye he picks it up turning it in his hand the colored stones catching the moonlight
how the hell did it get there
dont forget your cross its beautiful
a flicker of a smile crosses hicks face realizing
i think its for you
alone in the darkness priest sits on his cycle his hand clutching the well worn photo of the pace family
his eyes shift gazing into the distance at the outpost a warm glow emanating from within the cabin
he places the photo in his pocket
the wind making a high lonely sound
priest streaks into the night bathed in moonlight desolation opening around him
he disappears into the emptiness
the vampire train
a car lies half buried in the sand mangled cage within
emerges from inside clamping onto metal something dragging itself out into the moonlight
its a pureblood
with a screech it takes to the night sky massive black wings fluttering arcing towards the twinkling metropolis
