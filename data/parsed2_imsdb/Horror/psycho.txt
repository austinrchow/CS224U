b if window
href b b by joseph stefano based on the novel by robert bloch revised december above midtown section of the city
it is early afternoon a hot mid summer day
the city is sun sunblanched white and its drifted up noises are muted in blanched their own echoes
we fly low heading in a downtown direction passing over traffic clogged streets parking lots white business buildings neatly patterned residential districts
as we approach downtown section the character of the city begins to change
it is darker and shabby with age and industry
we see railroad tracks smokestacks wholesale fruit and vegetable markets old municipal buildings empty lots
vegetable the very geography seems to give us a climate of nefariousness of back doorness dark and shadowy
we fly lower and faster now as if seeking out a specific location
a skinny high old hotel comes into view
on its exposed brick side great painted letters advertise transients low weekly rates radio in every room
we pause long enough to establish the shoddy character of this hotel
its open curtainless windows its silent resigned look so characteristic of such hole and corner hotels
we move forward with purposefulness and toward a certain window
the sash is raised as high as it can go but the shade is pulled down to three or four inches of the inside sill as if the occupants of
the room within wanted privacy but needed air
we are close now so that only the lower half of the window frame is in shot
no sounds come from within the room
suddenly we tip downward go to the narrow space between shade and sill peep into the room
a young woman is stretched out on the mussed bed
she wears a full slip stockings no shoes
she lies in and attitude of physical relaxation but her face seen in the dimness of the room betrays a certain inner tension worrisome conflicts
she is mary crane an tension attractive girl nearing the end of her twenties and her rope
a man stands beside the bed only the lower half of his figure visible
we hold on this tableau for a long moment then start forward
as we pass under the window shade a small room a slow fan buzzing on a shelf above the narrow bed
a card of hotel rules is pasted on the mirror above the bureau
an unopened suitcase and a womans large straw open top handbag are on the bureau
on the table beside the bed there are a container of coco cola and an unwrapped untouched egg salad sandwich
there is no radio
the man standing by the bed wearing only trousers t shirt and sox is sam loomis a good looking sensual shirt man with warm humorous eyes and a compelling smile
he is blotting his neck and face with a thin towel and is staring down at mary a small sweet smile playing about his mouth
mary keeps her face turned away from him
after a moment sam drops the towel sits on the bed leans over and takes mary into his arms kisses her long and warmly holds her with a firm possessiveness
the kiss is disturbed and finally interrupted by the buzzing closeness of an inconsiderate fly
sam smiles pulls away enough to allow mary to relax again against the pillow
he studies her frowns at her unresponsiveness then speaks in a low intimate playful voice
never did eat your lunch did you
mary looks at his smile has to respond pulls him to her kisses him
then and without breaking the kiss she swings her legs over the side of the bed toe searches around finds her shoes slips her feet into searches them
and finally pulls away and sits up
i better get back to the office
these extended lunch hours give my boss excess acid
she rises goes to the bureau takes a pair of small earrings out of her bag begins putting them on not bothering or perhaps not wanting to look at herself
in the mirror
sam watches her concerned but unable to inhibit his cheery humorous good mood
throughout remainder of this scene they occupy themselves with dressing hair combing etc
call your boss and tell him youre taking the rest of the afternoon off
its friday anyway
soft sarcasm what do i do with my free afternoon walk you to the airport
meaningfully we could laze around here a while longer
checking out time is three p
hotels of this sort arent interested in you when you come in but when your times up
a small anguish sam i hate having to be with you in a place like this
ive heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels
they say it
interrupting when youre married you can do a lot of things deliberately
you sure talk like a girl whos been married
im sorry mary
after a moment my old dad used to say when you cant change a situation laugh at it
nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it
ive lost my girlish laughter
observing the only girlish thing you have lost
a meaningful quiet then with difficulty sam
this is the last time
meeting you in secret so we can be
you come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and
i wish you wouldnt even come
what do we do instead write each other lurid love letters
about to argue then turning away i havent time to argue
im a working girl
and im a working man
were a regular working class tragedy
he laughs it is tragic
or it will be
if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax deductible excuse for flying down deductible here
interrupting seriously you cant laugh at it huh
its like laughing through a broken jaw but
he breaks off his cheeriness dissolved goes to the window tries to raise the shade
he pulls at it
it comes down entirely and the hot sun glares into the room revealing it in all its shabbiness and sordidness as if corroborating marys words and attitude
sam kicks at the fallen shade laughs in frustration grabs on to his humor again
and besides when you say i make tax deductible excuses you make me out a criminal
having to smile you couldnt be a criminal if you committed a major crime
i wish i were
not an active criminal but
a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal
goes close to mary touches her next best thing to no conscience at all
pulling away i have to go sam
i can come down next week
not even just to see you to have lunch
we can see each other we can even have dinner
but respectably in my house with my mothers picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three
and after the steak
do we send sister to the movies and turn mamas picture to the wall
after a pause simply all right
she stares at him surprised at his willingness to continue the affair on her terms as girls are so often surprised when they discover men will continue to want them
even after the sexual bait has been pulled in
sam smiles reassuringly places his hands gently on her arms speaks with gentle and simple sincerity
mary whenever its possible tax deductible or not i want to see deductible you
and under any conditions
a smile even respectability
you make respectability sound
brightly im all for it
it requires patience and temperance and a lot of sweating out
otherwise though its only hard work
a pause but if i can see you touch you even as simply as this
i wont mind
he moves away and again the weight of his pain and problems crushes away his good humor
there is a quiet moment
im fed up with sweating for people who arent there
i sweat to pay off my fathers debts
and hes in his grave
i sweat to pay my ex wife alimony and shes living on the other side of the world somewhere
a smile i pay too
they also pay who meet in hotel rooms
a couple of years and the debts will be paid off
and if she ever re marries the alimony stops
i havent even been married once yet
yeah but when you do
smiling then with a terrible urgency sam lets go get married
and live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in fairvale
well have a lot of laughs
when i send my ex wife her money you can lick the stamps
a deep desperation ill lick the stamps
he looks at her long pulls her close kisses her lightly looks out the window and stares at the wide sky
you know what id like
a clear empty sky
and a plane and us in it
and somewhere a private island for sale where we can run around without our
and the wherewithal to buy what id like
he moves away suddenly serious mary you want to cut this off go out and find yourself someone available
im thinking of it
a cheerful shout how can you even think a thing like that
picking up handbag starting for door dont miss your plane
hey we can leave together cant we
at door im late
and you have to put your shoes on
mary goes out quickly closing door behind her
as sam stares down at his shoeless feet shooting down at hotel entrance
mary comes out walks quickly to a parked cab gets in
the cab zooms up the awful street
a small moderately successful office off the main street
a cab pulls up at the curb
we see mary get out of cab pay driver cross pavement to the office door
mary enters office crosses to her desk sits down rubs her temples finally looks over at caroline a girl in the last of her teens
lowery back from lunch
a high bright eager to talk voice laced to with a vague texan accent hes lunching with the man whos buying the harris street property you know that oil lease
so thats why hes late
a pause then as mary does not respond to the pointed thrust you getting a headache
headaches are like resolutions
you forget them soon as they stop hurting
you got aspirins
i have something
not aspirins but cheerfully takes bottle of pills out of desk drawer my mothers doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding
laughs teddy was furious when he found out id taken tranquilizers
she rises starts for marys desk pills in hand
were there any calls
and my mother called to see if teddy called
oh and your sister called to say shes going to tucson to do some buying and shell be gone the whole weekend and
she breaks off distracted by the sound of the door opening
lowery and his oil lease client tom cassidy enter the office
lowery is a pleasant worried faced man big and a trifle pompous
cassidy is very faced loud and has a lunch hour load on
he is a gross man exuding a kind of pitiful vulgarity
hot as fresh milk
you girls should get your boss to air condition you up
he can afford it today
lowery flashes an embarrassed smile at mary tries to lead cassidy toward the private office
mary will you get those copies of the deed ready for mr
cassidy pauses beside marys desk hooks a haunch onto the desktop smiles a wet smile at mary
tomorrows the day
my sweet little girl
laughs as mary looks up at him not you my daughter
a baby and tomorrow she stands up there and gets her sweet self married away from me
pulling out wallet i want you to look at my baby
eighteen years old
and shes never had an unhappy day in any one of those years
flashes photo mary glances cannot bring herself to smile or make some remark continues sorting out the deed copies tries to ignore the mans hot breath closeness
come on tom my office is air conditioned
ignoring lowery you know what i do with unhappiness
i buy it off
puts deed copy into cassidys too close hand im buying this house for my babys wedding present
forty thousand dollars cash
now that aint buying happiness thats buying off unhappiness
that penniless punk shes marryin
laughs probably a good kid
its just that i hate him
looks at deed yup
forty thousand says here
to lowery casharoonie
he takes out of his inside pocket two separate bundles of new bills and throws them onto the desk under marys nose
carolines eyes go wide at the sight of the glorious green bundles of bills and she comes close to the desk
cassidy leans terribly close to mary flicks through the bills laughs wickedly
i never carry more than i can afford to lose
closer to mary count em
shocked worried tom
cash transactions of this size

laughs winks elbows lowery and now its yours
staring at the money i declare
whispering i dont

laughs hastily interrupting suppose we just put this in the safe and then monday morning when youre feeling good
speakin of feeling good wheres that bottle you said you had in your desk
laughs as if having given away lowerys secret oops
to mary patting her arm usually i can keep my mouth shut
he rises reels toward lowerys office pauses turns speaks to mary meaningfully
i can keep any private transaction a secret
stopped by marys cold gaze lowery
im dyin of thirstaroonie
lowery starts after him pauses turns to mary
cassidy has gone into lowers office
quietly i dont even want it in the office over the weekend
put it in the safe deposit box at the bank mary
and well get him to give us a check on monday instead
he starts quickly away when it looks like cassidy is going to come and pull him bodily into the office
when the men are gone and the door is closed caroline picks up a bundle smiles at it
he was flirting with you
i guess he noticed my wedding ring
mary has put one bundle into a large envelope and takes the other from caroline
when the bills are away she puts the filled envelope in her handbag notices the remaining deed copies on her desk picks them up goes to the private office door
knocks starts to open door as come in
mary opens door looks in
cassidy is drinking from a large tumbler winks at her without pausing in his drinking
mary remains on threshold a moment then crosses to the desk talking as she goes
lowery if you dont mind id like to go right on home after the bank
i have a slight
you go right home
me and your boss are going out to get ourselves a little drinkin done
to lowery right
to mary of course
you feeling ill
you need a week end in las vegas
playground of the world
im going to spend this week end in bed
starts out to lowery only playground that beats las vegas
mary goes back out into the outer office closes door
mary goes to her desk takes the handbag checks to make sure the money filled envelope is tucked well down into it
during this arent you going to take the pills
as mary shakes her head theyll knock that headache out
i dont need pills
she goes to the door
a double bed in the foreground
we just see the far side as the camera shoots across
mary enters the scene clad only in her slip
perhaps she is about to get into bed
behind her is an open closet but too dark inside for us to see any contents
as mary turns to the closet the camera lowers to show a close view of the in the envelope on our side of the bed
mary takes a dress from the closet and starts to put it on as the camera retreats to reveal a packed but not yet closed suitcase also on the bed
mary zips up her dress and then brings some final garments from the closet
she comes around to the suitcase and puts them on the top
mary works with haste and in tension as if acting on an impulse which might vanish as quickly as it came
the suitcase filled now she checks around the room then takes her handbag to the bed puts in the money filled envelope and then slams the suitcase shut
then filled she looks at her small bedroom desk goes to it removes a small file envelope from one of the drawers
it is one of those brown envelopes in which one keeps important papers and policies and certificates
she checks its contents briefly puts it on the bed opens another desk drawer takes out her bank book tosses it on the bed
then she packs both the file envelope and the bank book into her handbag takes one quick last look around the room picks up the handbag and the suitcase and
goes out of the room
a two car garage
one car is gone
marys car is parked in the driveway
the camera is low enough so that we can easily read the arizona number plate in the foreground
mary comes out of house starts for the trunk intending to put the suitcase in changes her mind places the suitcase and her handbag on the front seat gets in
starts the car begins to back out of driveway
we are close on marys car shooting in at her troubled guilty face
she seems to be driving with that excess care of one who does not wish to be stopped for a minor traffic irregularity
she stops for a red light at a main intersection
we see lowery and cassidy crossing the street passing right in front of marys car
cassidy glancing into car sees mary lets out a cheery exclamation elbows lowery
lowery turns sees mary smiles pleasantly pulls cassidy on
mary watches the entire exchange with a look of stony horror on her face
now we look closely at lowery
as he reaches the curb a small confusion brightens his face
he remembers that mary intended to spend the weekend in bed
he considers curiously turns looks back at her a slight frown on his face
mary sees the pause and the look
for a moment it even looks as if lowery might be meaning to cross back to the car
marys tension is unbearable
and at that moment we hear the shrill shriek of the traffic cops whistle
mary zooms the car away
mary in car driving safely away from town
her look is less tense now and more purposeful
after a moment she checks the fuel gauge frowns looks along highway for a gas station
approaching and leaving city limits
looks at gas gauge
we see marys car drive in come to a stop
there are no other cars about this being a gas station off the main highway and the attendant is obviously in the shack
mary looks worried about having to make this stop keeps her face turned away from the shack not wishing it to be seen
no one comes and for a moment mary considers driving on as if the emptiness of the station were a warning an omen that she should listen to
but the gas registers almost empty
she has to blow her horn
a young man comes out of the shack starts toward her car
at that moment we hear the ringing of the telephone in the shack
the attendant walks a few steps further toward marys car then decides to go back and answer the phone
the phones insistent ringing unnerves mary
she starts her car zooms off
we see the attendant phone in hand in the doorway of shack
he looks after the departing car with little or no expression
the car grows smaller as it races up the road
the sun is setting
there is something vaguely ominous about the darkening sky into which the car seems to be disappearing
the oncoming headlights hurt marys eyes
she is getting sleepy and her vision is blurring
her eyes close involuntarily snap open again
she stretches than wide as if forcing them to stay open
the oncoming lights seem to glare to a point beyond endurance
she murmurs sam sam
we see marys car dim in the early dawn tilted on the soft shoulder of the road looking somehow sad and pathetic like a childs thrown away toy
and from this angle it would appear that the car is empty
after a moment during which there are no other vehicles passing we see coming from the far distance a highway patrolman in a patrol car
he passes marys car notes its apparent emptiness u turns comes back up behind the car
he gets out and approaches the drivers side window
the patrolman looks down into the car
mary turns with a start sits up is startled and unnerved by the sight of the patrolman and as if by automatic reflex turns the ignition and presses down on
the patrolman holds up his hand
startled hold it there
mary slams down on the brake tries to pull herself together
the patrolman raps again less gently
reluctantly mary rolls down the window
the patrolman studies her for a moment
in quite a hurry
because he seems to be awaiting an explanation i didnt mean to sleep so long
i was afraid id have an accident last night from sleepiness
so i decided to pull over
you slept here all night
a faint edge of defensiveness yes
as i said i couldnt keep my eyes
mere concern there are plenty of motels in this area
you should have
i mean just to be safe
i didnt intend to sleep all night
i just pulled over
have i broken any laws
then im free to go
a pause is anything wrong
of course not
am i acting as if
almost a smile frankly yes
id like to go
is there what
not waiting for an answer ive told you theres nothing wrong
except that im in a hurry and youre taking up my time
interrupting sternly now wait just a moment
turn your motor off please
mary seems about to object thinks better of it turns off the ignition
in the course of my duty i never take up anyones time whether its to give a warning or a ticket or help
believe that mam
a little softer now if you woke up on the wrong side of
the car seat thats one thing
but when you act as if ive just placed you under arrest
no need to apologize
mary starts the car her face turned as if she wishes the matter were all settled and the patrolman had already gone
the patrolman isnt exactly one of those civil servants who demands a thank you but he does feel her manner is a bit too abrupt
he calls wait a minute
jamming down the brake now what
the patrolman gazes at her a moment then may i see your license
mary pulls her handbag up from the floor where shed placed it when she stretched out for sleep
she puts her hand in it rummages for her wallet cannot find it
the patrolman is staring at her
she glances at him nervously pokes in her bag a bit more sighs realizes shell have to remove some of its contents
nervously badly controlling her fear she takes out the money filled envelope and then the important papers envelope filled then a couple of other items places them on the seat
finally finds her wallet opens it hands it to him
he looks at the wallet then at the car
the patrolman walks around to the front of the car checks the license plate and returns
the patrolman peers in checks the car registration on the steering wheel returns marys wallet
she takes it looks at him for a flicker of a moment
he says nothing
she starts ahead fast
the patrolman stares after mary as she drives off then starts back to his automobile
she is quite shaken realizes she caused herself a great deal of trouble and placed herself in unnecessary danger
she is disturbed and angry and frightened at her inability to act normally under the pressure of guilt
as she drives she glances into her rear view mirror
the patrolman is following in his automobile keeping behind her at a matched speed
she glances out at her surroundings
the freeway ahead
she suddenly turns off the highway
she checks her mirror
the patrolman is no longer following has not turned off after her
she breathes a sigh of relief thinks a moment makes a quick decision
the big sign reads california charlie automobile paradise
we see marys car drive onto the lot and stop
mary gets out of the car glances toward the lot office turns her attention to the line of cars notice the california licence plates on all of them
the car dealer calls out from his office with you in a second
mary nods starts walking along the line of cars as if making a selection
her eye is caught by the iron newspaper stand on the corner just outside the lot
she stares at the papers turns away as if what she is fearing would have to be impossible then having to satisfy herself goes to the stand drops a dime
in the iron slot picks up a los angeles newspaper starts back into the car lot as she glances worried at the front page
as she goes we see coming up the street toward the lot the same patrolman
he sees mary slows swerves over to the opposite side of the street stops by the curb
mary engrossed in the newspaper and walking back ease the lot does not see the patrolman
the car dealer is out on the lot now standing and waiting for mary
as she approaches lost in her newspaper he smiles
im in no mood for trouble
glancing up thrown for a moment what
cheerfully theres an old saying first customer of the day is always the most trouble
but like i said im in no mood for it so im just going to treat you so fair and square you wont have one human reason to give me
interrupting can i trade in my car and take another
you can do anything youve a mind to
and bein a woman you will
chin indicating her car that yours
nothing wrong with it im just
sick of the sight of it
laughs well suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile ill have my mechanic give yours the once over and
want some coffee
i was just about
i just want to make a change and start
she stops suddenly almost with a gasp
she has seen the patrolman
he is staring over at her his face dispassionate
mary has to force herself to look away
one thing people never ought to be when theyre buying a used car is in a hurry
starting away toward her car but like i said too nice a day for arguing
ill just shoot this into the garage
he starts into marys car
she looks at him in near panic wanting to skip the whole thing
torn wondering if the presence of the patrolman doesnt negate the value of changing cars wondering how she can get away wondering if shell be followed or if the patrolman
will go away if she does stay here
all these panic fears rush her mind and she can do nothing
the car dealer has driven her car into the garage
she stands in the middle of the lot feeling like a shooting target
she looks toward the garage
marys car is in it
mary decides she cannot back out now without arousing further suspicion is compelled to look again at the patrolman
he still watches
with a self angry sigh of resignment she goes to a close car looks at it
the car dealer is returning
thats the one idve picked for you myself
spin it around the block
now i know you dont know anything about engine condition but you can feel cant you
and its all in the feel believe me you feel that one around the block
it looks fine
how much will it be with my car
you mean you dont want the usual day and a half to think it over
laughs you are in a hurry
somebody chasin you
of course not
heck this is the first time i ever saw the customer high pressure the salesman
laughs sees she is in no mood for it id figure roughly
looks at the car then back at the garage your car plus five hundred
always got time to argue money huh
as the car dealer looks at her in amazement she reaches into her bag feels the money filled envelope pauses
slowly i take it
you can prove that cars yours
i mean out of state and all
got your pink slip and your
i think i have the necessary papers
is there a ladies room
in the building
indicates continues to stare quietly mary starts for the building glancing once in the direction of the patrolman
he still sits his motor throbbing his face quiet
mary goes into the office building
mary enters locks door takes envelope out of her handbag extracts one bundle of bills from the envelope counts off five puts the bundle back into the envelope and the
envelope back into the bag
then she remembers takes out the important papers envelope goes through it finds several papers having to do with her car takes them all out puts back the envelope starts
out of the ladies room
the car dealer has moved the car of her choice out of the line
it stands in the clearing
too cheerfully i think youd better give it a trial spin
dont want any bad word of mouth about california charlie
id really rather not
cant we just settle this and
ill be perfectly honest with you maam
its not that i dont trust you but
interrupting but what
is there anything so terribly wrong about
making a decision and wanting to hurry
do you think ive stolen
i was only about to say ive sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test
handing him the ownership papers and the new bills id like to be ready when he gets back
if youll come along
he starts toward the office building
mary follows closely anxiously
she glances sees he is still at the far curb
the car dealer goes into his office
a second later he starts his automobile checks traffic comes across the street slowly and drives onto the lot
he pauses a moment then drives across the lot passing the office going on to the other exit stops there as marys car is driven back onto the lot
the mechanic stops marys car hops out waves to the patrolman
the patrolman waves back goes on a bit until he is behind marys car stops again looks over at the office
in a moment mary comes out hurries across to her new car gets in starts the motor
the mechanic yells hey
mary pauses turns sees the patrolman then the mechanic
her face goes white
she doesnt know which man called her
then the mechanic waves starts forward with her suitcase
as mechanic reaches car just put it right in here please
the mechanic smiles throws the suitcase in
mary zooms off
as she drives out of lot we see the mechanic the car dealer and the patrolman all looking after her
mary is driving tensely
she checks the rear view mirror is more shocked than pleased when she sees
no sign of the patrolman
she turns her face looks out at the highway
it is heavy with traffic
again she checks the mirror and although
there is still no sign of the patrolman
she cannot relax or feel safe cannot convince herself that nothing will come of the mans watching and suspicions
camera is close on marys face now recording her anxiety her fears
her guilt shines bright in her eyes and she is a person unaccustomed to containing this much guilt in this realistic a situation
suddenly we hear the sound of the used car dealers laugh hear it as clearly as mary hears it in her imagination
the imagined voice we hear is actually the voice of the car dealer heck officer that was the first time i ever saw the customer high pressure the salesman
somebody chasing her
i better have a look at those papers charlie
she look like a wrong one to you
acted like one
mary blinks shakes her head as if trying to shake away these voices of her imagination
she checks the rear view mirror
still no sight of the patrolman
she tries to force herself to relax almost succeeds when she is sprung to tension again by
the sight of a police car
as she drives past we hear the squeaky unintelligible voice coming over the car radio
mary zooms down on the gas whizzes ahead
marys car dashing along
mary looks weary tired with strain and with hard driving
her eyes are heavy with worry and deep thought
we can see that it is much later in the day almost dusk
we hear the sound of an agitated buzz of an intercom system a sound emanating from marys imagination
after the second buzz we hear the voice of caroline
a worried tone caroline
mary still isnt in
but then shes always a bit late on monday mornings
buzz me the minute she comes in
again mary shakes her head forces herself to stop hearing these invented scenes of her imagination
now we cut to the view of the road from marys viewpoint
darkness of evening is coming
in the dim twilight we see the neon sign of roadside restaurants and gas stations beginning to blaze on
back on marys face and after a moment the imagined voices again call her sister
if no ones answering at the house
i called her sister mr
lowery where she works the music makers music store you know
and she doesnt know where mary is any more than we do
you better run out to the house
she may be
unable to answer the phone
her sisters going to do that
shes as worried as we are
a flush of painful guilt and regret rises up in marys face
she closes her eyes for one tight swift moment
we cut again to the highway
the first oncoming headlights slash at the windshield
cutting back to mary we can sense by the tense muscles of her face that she is driving faster
the oncoming headlights blurt at her
suddenly we hear lowerys voice loud now and frightened as if the anxiety in the mans voice was strong enough to break through marys effort to keep her mind silent
and her imagination blank
i havent the faintest idea
as i said i last saw your sister when she left this office on friday
she said she didnt feel well and wanted to leave early and i said she could
and that was the last i saw
a pause a thought wait a minute i did see her an hour or so later driving
a pause then with solemn fear ah i think youd better come over here to my office
a pause a click caroline get mr
cassidy for me
it is completely dark now night
we cut back to her face
after all cassidy i told you
all that cash
im not taking the responsibility
oh for heavens sake a girl works for you for ten years you trust her
all right yes you better come over
fast cut back to marys face
oncoming headlights throw a blinding light across her features
undrunk sharp with rage well i aint about to kiss off forty thousand dollars
ill get it back and if any of its missin ill replace it with her fine soft flesh
ill track her never you doubt it
hold on cassidy
i still cant believe
it must be some kind of a mystery
you checked with the bank no
they never laid eyes on her no
you still trustin
hot creepers she sat there while i dumped it out
hardly even looked at it plannin and
and even flirtin with me
a look of revulsion makes mary close her eyes
big drops of rain begin to appear
she is becoming aware of the rain starting
the rain increasing and backlit by the oncoming headlights
mary starts the windshield wipers
the wipers are having a battle with the now torrential rain
peering through the blurred windshield
slowing down in the flooding highway
peering through the windshield
the oncoming lights are fewer
almost coming to a slow turn
just blackness and rain
an almost undiscernible light in the far distance a neon sign blurred by the rain sheeted windshield
she presses down forces the car to move on through the flooded road
as we move closer we see the neon sign more clearly and can faintly make out the large letters which read motel
mary stops the car lowers the window slightly looks out
we see the sign clearly now bates motel
mary opens the car door and dashes out into the rain and up onto the porch of the motel office
mary pauses on the porch
the lights are on within the office
she tries door finds it open goes into office
camera follows her into office
there is no one present
mary goes to the desk rings a small pushbell
there is no response
mary rubs her forehead in weariness and frustration goes back out onto the porch
she looks off in another direction slightly behind the office and sees
a path from the motel office leads directly up to this house
there is a light on in one of the upstairs rooms
a woman passes the window pauses peers out
we see her in clear silhouette
she quickly goes away from the window
mary having seen the woman expects now that she will get some attention
she stands a few moments waiting
no one comes
impatience and anger rise in mary
she dashes out into the rain to her car gets in opens the side window begins to honk the horn
after a moment a young man open the front door of the house pauses starts down the path
after a few steps he turns and runs back into the house
mary leaves her car starts a dash for the shelter of the porch
as she runs we see that the young man has gone back only to get an umbrella
seeing that mary is on her way to the porch he runs quickly the umbrella unopened in his hand
he gets to the porch a moment after mary has reached it
he stops short looks at her then at the umbrella hanging useless in his hand then back to her
there is something sadly touching in his manner in his look
marys impatience goes and she smiles and this makes him almost smile
he gestures her into the office standing back to indicate that he will go after her
she goes into the office
the young man follows mary in closes the door
he is norman bates somewhere in his late twenties thin and tall soft spoken and hesitant
not really a question you have a vacancy
simply almost cheerfully we have twelve vacancies
twelve cabins twelve vacancies
a pause they moved away the highway
i thought id gotten off the main
i knew you must have
no one stops here anymore unless they do
he is behind the counter now pushing forward the registration book
but its no good dwelling on our losses is it
we go right ahead lighting signs and following the formalities
would you sign please
mary has placed her handbag on the counter
she takes the registration book picks up the pen is suddenly struck with the realization that shed better use an alias
she writes the name marie samuels
your home address
oh just the town will do
glancing at newspaper sticking out of her handbag los angeles
she realizes he didnt ask her to tell him merely to write it down
she smiles writes los angeles beside the false name
norman smiles stops smiling out of embarrassment
its closer in case you want anything
right next to the office
he removes a key for cabin one
we see that there is a remaining key on the board
i want sleep more than anything
except maybe food
theres a big diner about ten miles on up
just outside fairvale
am i that close to fairvale
ill get your bags
he goes to door opens it
the rain has slowed down considerably
he smiles at this fact as if to communicate some pleasure he finds in it
mary follows him to the door goes out on the porch waits and watches as norman runs to her car gets in drives it to the parking space in front
of cabin one
mary walks along the porch waits before the door of cabin one
norman gets out of car with suitcase runs to the door opens it pushes the door open puts his hand in and switches on a light
mary goes into the cabin
norman follows her
norman places suitcase on bed goes to the window opens it
stuffy in here
turns to her well
the mattress is soft and therere hangers in the closet and
stationary with bates motel printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious
he points to the bathroom fairly blushes the bathroom
quickly starting to leave ill be in the office if you want anything
just tap on the wall
thank you mr
he pauses at the door gazes at her
you have something most girls never have
theres no name for it
but its something that that puts a person at ease
not really a question youre not going to go out again and drive up to that diner are you
then will you do me a favor
without waiting for her response will you have supper here
i was just about to myself
nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk but id like it if youd come up to the house and
i dont set a fancy table but
the kitchens awful homey
id like to
all right you get your dresses hanging out and
change those wet shoes and ill come for you soon as its ready
starts out with my trusty umbrella
he laughs a small laugh runs off mary closes the door goes to suitcase opens it starts to take out a dress
her handbag is next to the suitcase
she glances down into it pauses drops the dress reaches into the handbag takes out the money filled envelope stares at it almost with regret filled contemplates hiding it decides
to starts looking for a reasonable hiding place
she looks about at the closet the drawers etc
realizes all such places are obvious
catching sight of the newspaper in her bag she hits on a solution
she opens the newspaper places the envelope within it lock folds the paper again and then places it on the bedside table as if it were there for later reading
she considers this for a moment accepts it goes to her suitcase to start unpacking
suddenly the quiet is shattered by the shrill ugly sound of a womans voice raised in anger
i tell you no
mary walks slowly to the window realizing that the terrible voice is coming from the house behind the cabins
camera follows her to window and once there we see the light is still on in the upstairs bedroom and the voice is coming from that room
the rain has stopped and the moon is out
i wont have you bringing strange young girls in for supper
an ugly sneering note creeps into the voice by candlelight i suppose in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap erotic minds
and then what
after supper music
mother shes just a stranger
hungry and the weathers bad
mimicking cruelly mother shes just a stranger
hard cruel again as if men dont desire strangers as if
oh i refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me
you understand boy
pause go on go tell her shell not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food
or my son
or do i have to tell her cause you dont have the guts
you have the guts boy
blurted cut fury and shame shut up
there is the sound of a door closing in that room up there
mary has stood by the window listening with mounting distress and concern and sympathy
she turns her face away now gazes sadly at the little empty room
in a moment there is the sound of the houses front door slamming shut
mary turns looks out the window
we see norman coming down the path carrying a napkin covered tray
mary looks at him for a moment then turns quickly goes to the door opens it and goes out onto the porch
mary pauses outside the door is about to start forward when norman comes round the building and walks along the porch past the office stopping only when he is close
he stares with painful embarrassment at the knowing look in her eye
ive caused you some trouble
a hollow little laugh an attempt at sardonic humor what is the phrase
she isnt herself today
i think thats it
looking at the tray you shouldnt have bothered
i really dont have that much of an appetite
norman flinches realizing she has heard his mothers reference to marys appetite
people could apologize for other people
dont worry about it
a warm smile but as long as youve made us supper we may as well eat it
she begins to back into her room
norman starts to follow hesitates as he sees the total picture of an attractive young woman and a motel room
bringing down the tray of food in defiance of his mothers orders is about the limit of his defiance for one day
he cannot go into marys room
it might be nicer
warmer in the office
without waiting for approval or disapproval he turns hurries to the office
mary looks after him her face showing amused sympathy then follows
norman looks about tray in hand sees there is no reasonable place to spread out a supper
he turns sees mary standing in the doorway
eating in an office
a rueful smile to officious even for me
i have the parlor behind this
if youd like
norman walks on behind the counter and into the darkened parlor
in the darkened room lit only by the light from the office spilling in we see norman placing the tray on a table
mary comes to the doorway pauses
norman straightens up goes to lamp turns on the light
mary is startled by the room
even in the dimness of one lamp the strange extraordinary nature of the room rushes up at one
it is a room of birds
stuffed birds all over the room on every available surface one even clinging to the old fashioned fringed shade of the lamp
the birds are of many varieties beautiful grand horrible preying
mary stares in awe and a certain fascinated horror
please sit down
on the sofa
as norman goes about spreading out the bread and ham and pouring the milk we follow mary across the room
she studies the birds as she walks briefly examines a bookcase stacked with books on the subject of taxidermy
she notices too the paintings on the wall nudes primarily and many with a vaguely religious overtone
finally mary reaches the sofa sits down looks at the spread
its all for you
im not hungry
please go ahead
mary begins to eat her attitude a bit tense
she takes up a small slice of ham bites off a tiny bite nibbles at it in the manner of one disturbed and preoccupied
norman gazes at her at the tiny bite she has taken smiles and then laughs
you eat like a bird
youd know of course
i hear that expression that one eats like a bird is really a falsie i mean a falsity because birds eat a tremendous lot
a pause then explaining oh i dont know anything about birds
my hobby is stuffing things
and i guess id just rather stuff birds because
well i hate the look of beasts when theyre stuffed foxes and chimps and all
some people even stuff dogs and cats
but i cant
i think only birds look well stuffed because theyre rather
passive to begin with
most of them
he trails off his exuberance failing in the rushing return of his natural hesitancy and discomfort
mary looks at him with some compression smiles
its a strange hobby
curious i mean
i imagine so
its not as expensive as youd think
needles thread sawdust
the chemicals are all that cost anything
he goes quiet looks disturbed a man should have a hobby
its more than a hobby
a hobby is supposed to pass the time not fill it
after a pause softly is your time so empty
forcing brightness again i run the office tend the cabins and grounds do little chores for mother
the ones she allows i might be capable of doing
you go out
who needs friends
laughs then with gallows humor a boys best friend is his mother
stops laughing youve never had an empty moment in your whole life
only my share
where are you going
i dont mean to pry
a wistful smile im looking for a private island
what are you running away from
alert why do you ask that
people never run away from anything
a pause the rain didnt last very long
turning suddenly you know what i think
i think were all in our private traps clamped in them and none of us can ever climb out
we scratch and claw
but only at the air only at each other and for all of it we never budge an inch
sometimes we deliberately step into those traps
i was born in mine
i dont mind it anymore
oh i do
but i say i dont
laughs boyishly staring at him shaking her head softly
if anyone ever spoke to me the way i heard
the way she spoke to you i dont think i could ever laugh again
controlled resentment sometimes when she talks that way to me id like to
curse her out and leave her forever
a rueful smile or at least defy her
a pause a hopeless shrug but i couldnt
she sounded strong
a pause she had to raise me all by herself after my dad died
i was only five
and it must have been a strain
oh she didnt have to go out to work or anything dad left us with a little something
anyway a few years ago
mother met a man
he talked her into building this motel
we could have talked her into anything
it was just too much for her when he died too
and the way he died
oh its nothing to talk about when youre eating
pauses smiles anyway it was too much of a loss for my mother
she had nothing left
critically except you
a son is a poor substitute for a lover
turns away as if in distaste of the word why dont you go away
to a private island like you
no not like me
its too late for me
whod look after her
shed be alone up there the fire would go out
damp and cold like a grave
when you love someone you dont do that to them even if you hate them
oh i dont hate her
what shes become
slowly carefully wouldnt it be better if you put her in
norman turns slowly looking at her with a striking coldness
people always call a madhouse someplace
mimicing coldly put her in someplace
i didnt mean it to sound uncaring
the coldness turning to tight fury what do you mean about caring
have you ever seen one of those places
laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you
and my mother there
has she harmed you
shes as harmless as
one of these stuffed birds
i am sorry
i only felt
it seemed she was harming you
high fury now well
you meant well
people always mean well they cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads and suggest so very delicately that
the fury suddenly dies abruptly and completely and he sinks back into his chair
there is a brief silence
mary watches the troubled man is almost physically pained by his anguish
quietly ive suggested it myself
but i hate to even think such a thing
she needs me
and it isnt
looks up with a childlike pleading in his eyes it isnt as if she were a maniac a raving thing
its just that
sometimes she goes a little mad
we all go a little mad sometimes
after a long thoughtful pause yes and just one time can be enough
rises thank you
cheerfully correcting thank you norman
youre not going to
to your room already
im very tired
and ill have a long drive tomorrow
all the way back to phoenix
i stepped into a private trap back there and i want to go back and
try to pull myself out
looking close at norman before its too late for me too
looking at her why dont you stay a little while just for talking
id like to but
ill see you in the morning
ill bring you breakfast
what time will you
he has forgotten her name crane
he frowns as if bothered by not being able to match the name to the memory of the name in the registration book good night
she goes out of the parlor
we see her from normans viewpoint as she crosses the small office goes out into the night
norman turns and looks at the table and we see his face now
it is bright with that drunken like look of determination and encouragement and like resolve
he starts to clean up the table pauses as he hears the closing of marys door in the cabin next door
he holds still listens
he goes into the office and looks at the book
he goes back into the parlor with a mystified expression
the sound of mary moving about her room come over soft sounds somehow intimate in the night quiet
norman turns his ear from the direction of the sounds seems to be fighting an impulse to listen or more than listen
but slowly he is forced to surrender to the impulse and resisting himself he goes to the wall presses the side of his head against it
the sounds come louder as if we too had our ear pressed against the wall
now norman looks at a picture hanging on the far end of the wall he is leaning against
slowly he starts toward it
he reaches it touches it reluctantly lifts the small frame off the wall
a tiny circle of light hits normans face coming from the hole in the wall behind the picture
this end of the room is very dim and thus we are able to see clearly the light striking normans face
we move close to norman extremely close until his profile fills the screen
the tiny spot of light hits his eye
see the small hole through which the light comes
norman peeps through
through the hole we look into marys cabin see mary undressing
she is in her bra and halfslip
she stoops over a bit places her hands behind her upper back begins to unhook her bra
he watches as mary removes her bra
we see his eye run up and down the unseen figure of mary
mary just slipping into a robe covering her complete nudity
he turns from the hole faces us for a moment continues turning until he can look out the small parlor window
we see as he sees
he turns his face away quickly resentfully
in his face we see anger and anguish
and then resolve
quickly precisely he rehangs the picture over the hole in the wall turns starts out of the parlor
we see him go through the office and out onto the porch not even bothering to close the door behind him
norman walking along the porch in the direction of the big house
once on the path he pauses looks up at the light in the bedroom window then pulls himself up squares his shoulders strides manfully up the path
camera follows behind him
he opens the door of the house enters
we see him pause at the foot of the stairway look up at the bedroom door just at the head of the stair
he holds for a moment and then his resolve and courage evaporates
his shoulders slump sadly mournfully
he by passes the stairs and slowly makes his way to the kitchen
at the far end of the hall
he enters the kitchen drops wearily into a chair
after a moment he stretches out a leg and gently pushes the kitchen door closed
mary is seated at the small desk engrossed in figuring in a small notebook
we see from these figures a calculation which indicates her intention to make a restitution of the money she has used of the forty thousand dollars
we see too her bankbook
the paper reads thus top figure directly beneath it the amount used for the new car total after subtraction
in another spot we see a figure which matches the balance in her bankbook
beneath this is the figure and the amount after subtraction
she studies the figures sighs not wearily but with a certain satisfaction with the pleasure that comes when one knows that at any cost one is going to continue doing
the right thing
after a moment she tears the page out of the notebook and rising begins to rip it into small pieces
she goes into the bathroom drops the pieces into the toilet bowl flushes the toilet
then she drops her robe and steps into the tub and turns the shower on
over the bar on which hangs the shower curtain we can see the bathroom door not entirely closed
for a moment we watch mary as she washes and soaps herself
there is still a small worry in her eyes but generally she looks somewhat relieved
now we see the bathroom door being pushed slowly open
the noise of the shower drowns out any sound
the door is then slowly and carefully closed
and we see the shadow of a woman fall across the shower curtain
marys back is turned to the curtain
the white brightness of the bathroom is almost blinding
suddenly we see the hand reach up grasp the shower curtain rip it aside
as she turns in response to the feel and sound of the shower curtain being torn aside
a look of pure horror erupts in her face
a low terrible groan begins to rise up out of her throat
a hand comes into the shot
the hand holds an enormous bread knife
the flint of the blade shatters the screen to an almost total silver blankness
an impression of a knife slashing as if tearing at the very screen ripping the film
over it the brief gulps of screaming
and then silence
and then the dreadful thump as marys body falls in the tub
the blank whiteness the blur of the shower water the hand pulling the shower curtain back
we catch one flicker of a glimpse of the murderer
a woman her face contorted with madness her head wild with hair as if she were wearing a fright wig
and then we see only the curtain closed across the tub and hear the rush of the shower water
above the shower bar we see the bathroom door open again and after a moment we hear the sound of the front door slamming
lying half in half out of the tub the head tumbled over touching the floor the hair wet one eye wide open as if popped one arm lying limp and
wet along the tile floor
coming down the side of the tub running thick and dark along the porcelain we see many small threads of blood
camera follows away from the body travels slowly across the bathroom past the toilet out into the bedroom
as camera approaches the bed we see the folded newspaper as mary placed it on the bedside table
beside the bed
the camera now moves away over to the window and looks up to the house and as it gets there we hear coming from within the house the sound of
normans fearful shocked voice
oh god what
we cannot entirely distinguish these exclamations
after a moment or two of silence norman emerges from the front door dashes down the path toward the motel
norman is coming at camera running head on
he dashes into an extreme close up and we see the terror and fear ripe in his face
camera pans as norman races past holds as norman runs to the porch and quickly along it and directly to marys room
norman pauses a moment in the doorway glances about the room hears the shower going sees the bathroom door is open
he goes to the bathroom looks in sees the body
slowly almost carefully he raises his hands to his face covers his eyes turns his face away
then he crosses to the window looks out at the house
shot is so angled that we see the bedside table with the newspaper on it
after a moment norman moves from the window sinks onto the edge of the bed
norman sitting on bed the bathroom in b
we can see only the hand of the dead girl lying along the tile floor
norman presses his eyes fights to find a way out of his dilemma
slowly a kind of settling comes upon him the peace that comes with decision
norman rises goes to the window looks out and then with resolution closes the window and draws the curtain across it
then he crosses to the front window facing the porch and draws those curtains closed
then he switches off the bedroom light leaving the room lit only by the spill from the bathroom
he opens the front door goes out
norman comes out of marys cabin closes the door carefully behind him goes along the porch to his office goes in
we stay outside
immediately the vacancy sign goes off and then the motel sign goes off
as camera goes closer to the office the lights within go off and we hear a closet door opening and then the sound of a pail being picked up
norman comes out of office closes door looks cautiously about goes along porch carrying pail with mop in it goes into marys cabin closing the door after him
with the paper in the foreground norman enters
we can see him in the dim spill of light
he pauses by the door then gathers his strength and goes into the bathroom
we hear him set the pail on the tiled floor and then we hear the shower being turned off
and there is total silence
camera moves forward so that we can see into bathroom
camera is angled that we see norman only from the waist up
quickly and deftly he unhooks the shower curtain emerges with it into the bedroom
camera pans down and we see him spread the shower curtain on the bedroom floor just outside the bathroom door
he spreads the curtain so that one end of it comes up against the bathroom threshold and slightly over and onto the tile floor
again he goes into the bathroom and camera tilts up so that we see only the upper half of norman
he works carefully with his arms extended away from his body slowly pulls the dead body out of the tub drags it across the tile floor and onto the spread
out shower curtain in the bedroom
having arranged the body he straightens up examines his hands sees bloodstains on them
he returns to the bathroom goes to the hand basin
we see his hands being washed see the bloodstains being diluted and washed away by the gush of the faucet water
we see norman shake his hands free of the water then turn to the job of cleaning the bathroom
he places the pail in the tub runs water into it dips the mop in swabs the tile floor
with a towel he wipes off the wall over the tub and the edges and sides of the tub and even the shower curtain rod
then he takes a second towel and goes over the cleaned areas carefully drying them
finally he rinses and squeezes out the mop empties the pail cleans out the tub and goes out into the bedroom
norman steps carefully around the unseen body crosses to the desk starts going through marys handbag in search of her car keys
he suddenly notices them lying on the desk where hed thrown them after parking her car
he picks up the keys crosses the room goes out
we see norman pauses at the door check cautiously then hurry across the porch and into marys car
he circle turns the car so that its trunk is backed up to the turns porch directly opposite marys door as close as it can go
then he alights goes to the trunk opens it with the key and leaving the trunk lid raised goes back into the cabin
from a raised angle we see norman bend down and begin to wrap the shower curtain around the body
we see the edges of the curtain as they are raised and laid down again
then he picks up the wrapped body crosses to the door uses his foot to pull the door open and leaving the door open behind him goes quickly across the
porch and gently lays the body in the trunk
he closes the lid then but does not lock it
he comes back into the cabin closes the door completely flicks on the light
again the newspaper is in the foreground
for a moment he pauses closes his eyes against the realization of what he is doing then quickly pushes all thoughts away continues with his work
with the room lighted he now proceeds to gather up all marys articles and toss them into the suitcase
he checks all drawers and the closet gets down and checks under bed and bureau goes into the bathroom checks that room again comes back into the bedroom looks about
carefully spots marys handbag throws even that into the suitcase is finally satisfied that all traces of the girl are gone from the room
then he closes marys suitcase picks it up
with his free hand he picks up the pail in which are the mop and the used towels
he crosses to the door switches off the light with his shoulder pulls open the door starts out
as norman stands in the doorway he is suddenly and blindingly lit by the bright headlights of a passing car
the flash of the lights and the sound of the speeding car are over in a flicker of a moment but it takes a few seconds for norman to regain
his former tense composure
then he goes to the car trunk raises it with his foot throws the suitcase and the pail into it slams it shut
he pauses a moment then realizes he has left the bathroom light on in marys cabin
he returns to cabin
as he enters his eye is caught by the newspaper on the bedside table
he goes to it takes the newspaper and looks once again into the bathroom
his glance goes right over the toilet bowl
he turns out the lights crosses the darkened cabin goes out onto the porch
he reopens the trunk tosses in the newspaper and closes it
he goes around and jumps into the car and starts away
we hold on the trunk follow it for a while then the car pulls away from a close angle on the trunk and as camera holds we see that we
are now in a swamp area
it is quiet except for the irritating noises of night insects
norman stops the car at the very edge of the swamp turns off the lights gets out leaving door open
he looks at the swamp seems doubtful of its ability to swallow up the car realizes he has no choice
he leans into the car releases the emergency brake starts to push
the front of the car begins to roll into the swamp
suddenly there is the low throbbing sound of a motor
norman freezes listens
the sound grows louder and norman realizes it is an airplane flying overhead
the car is rolling quickly now
norman jumps away slams the door shut stands tense
the sound of the plane overhead grows louder
norman looks up
we see no plane
the sound of the motor is beginning to diminish
we see the relief in his face
he looks at the car
more than two thirds of it have already sunk into the swamp
the trunk alone seems to hold poised above the sand and slime as if refusing to go the rest of the way
norman begins to panic he steps dangerously close pushes with his foot
and slowly the car sinks until finally it is gone and we hear only the gentle plop of the swamps final gulp and see only the small after bubble like
a visual burp
norman waits a moment then begins stamping out the tire marks so obvious in the wet ground around the swamp
he stamps and drags his feet over the markings as we standing on the porch of the motel leaning against a post
he is staring out into the night a look of guarded casual innocence on his face as if he were taking one last moment of peaceful night air before retiring
then he glances down and camera follows his gaze
a hose is lying on the ground outside marys cabin its stream of water obliterating the tire marks
after a moment normans hand comes into shot picks up hose places it in a new position
as camera pulls back we see that the water from the hose has erased and rearranged the road markings so that it would be impossible to tell that a car
had been parked here
after a short wait norman goes to the hose faucet turns it off unscrews the hose
as he rolls the hose he walks away from the spot past the office heading for the path that leads to the house
he goes up the path pauses at the steps of the house tosses the curled hose onto the lawn goes up the steps and into the house
camera follows him in pauses as he pauses at the foot of the stairs
norman goes up the stairs
on the landing he stops
the door to his mothers room is closed
lying in a heap outside the door are a blood stained dress and a pair of elderly womans shoes
from an extremely high angle we look down on norman as he bends to pick up the stained dress and shoes
he rolls the shoes into the dress tucks the small neat bundle under his arm and starts down the stairs heading for the basement
it stands silhouetted against the sky
there is a long wait
then slowly a curl of smoke comes out of the chimney
sam is seated at his desk writing a letter
sequence begins with camera in close over sams shoulder and we can read as mush as he has written of the letter
the letterhead reads sam loomis hardware and the letter reads dearest right as always mary im sitting in this tiny back room which isnt big enough for both of us
and suddenly it looks big enough for both of us
so what if were poor and cramped and miserable at least well be happy
if you havent come to your senses and still want to
camera begins pulling away as sam turns the sheet of paper over continues backing away out of the small back room and heads backwards down the corridor we see a
young clerk bob summerfield sams assistant standing behind the counter a look of handsome patience on his face
he is waiting on a meticulous elderly woman customer who is holding and examining a large can of insecticide
as camera passes they tell you what its ingredients are and how its guaranteed to exterminate any insect in the world but they do not tell you whether or not
and i say insect or man death should always be painless
camera by this has reached the front door of the hardware store and we now see a girl standing just inside the door
she is an attractive girl with a rather definite manner a look of purposefulness
she carries a handbag and a small overnight case
she is marys sister lila crane
bob summerfield has noticed lila smiles brightly at her gives her an ill be with you in a moment nod
lila starts to walk toward the counter never taking her eyes off bob
as she approaches she asks quietly sam
you want to see sam
yelling toward back room sam
lady wants to see you
lila looks to the back room
the woman customer goes on worriedly examining the fine print of the insecticide can
sam comes to the door of his room pauses looks at lila a moment starts toward her his expression indicating that he does not know her
lila studies him with a quiet worried expression
may i talk to you
a bit mystified sure
lila glances at the customer and the clerk turns starts toward the front of the store
sam holds a moment then follows
as he reaches her she turns her eyes studying him intently as she says im marys sister
quickly is mary here
sam is mystified and is also aware of the worried hostile expression on lilas face
he studies her for a quiet moment
behind them is a display of various size carving knives
is something wrong
i want to know if my sister is here
i dont know where
in your store somewhere in your town
whats the matter
dont you know
as sam is about to speak the woman customer comes sailing past speaking as she goes and wearing a satisfied smile
all i can do is hope if it isnt painless its quick
she speaks quick with a kind of delicious bite nods happily goes on out of the store
sam is now staring apprehensively at lila
what should i know
to begin with where mary is
i take it you dont either
as lila shakes her head how long
she left work and home
i was in tucson over the weekend
i havent heard from her not even a phone call
and you thought shed come up here to me
if she had what reason would she have for not calling you
a good reason i suppose
slightly exasperated well what do you think we eloped or something
or were living in sin and
loomis youre so busy being defensive that you havent even reacted to the most serious fact of all
mary is missing
i was getting to that
what do you know about it
youre putting me on the defensive
look if you two are in this thing together i dont care its none of my business
but i want to see mary
i want her to tell me shes all right and its none of my business
then ill go back to phoenix and
she stops the anxiety and fear building up in her her eyes beginning to fill with worried tears
sam studies her for a moment then turns and calls bob
run out and get yourself some lunch
its okay sam i brought it with me
run out and eat it
bob gets the message goes out through the back way
sam goes closer to lila speaks with soft seriousness
what thing could we be in together
a pause i hate tears
takes out hankie is mary
well why didnt she come to me
not that kind
almost a smile you men and your egos
seriously never mind my ego
lets talk about mary
their attention is distracted by a man who has strolled quietly into the room
he ignores them walks past them goes behind the counter takes down a sign reading closed for lunch walks back to the door closes door hangs the sign across the
door window locks the door turns to sam and lila folds his arms smiles a particularly unfriendly smile
lets all talk about mary
who are you friend
milt arbogast private investigator
to lila where is she miss crane
i dont know
wouldnt have been able to tail you if you did
whats your interest
there is a moments silence and then unable to tolerate the sudden frightening happenings sam explodes
somebody better tell me whats going on and tell me fast
i can take so much and then
interrupting calmly your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars
sam looks at arbogast in utter shock and in that state asks one of those seemingly ridiculous questions
an almost amused smile mustve needed it
what are you talking about
to lila what is this
she was supposed to bank it on friday for her boss
and no one has seen her since
looking at sam someone has seen her
someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars
to sam she is your girl friend isnt she
sam they dont want to prosecute they just want the money back
it was all in cash
correcting with cassidys word casharoonie
sam if shes here
a real look of anguish comes into lilas face
and arbogast studies it then speaks
you came up here on a hunch miss crane
no phone call
from him or from your sister herself
wearily not even a hunch
with a little checking i could get to believe you
anxiously i dont care if you do or
i want to see mary
before she gets in any deeper
did you check in phoenix
maybe she had an accident
a hold up
she was seen leaving town in her car
seen by her very victims i might add
after a moment i dont believe it
to lila slowly do you
a thoughtful pause yes
the moment they told me
you might have doubted for say five minutes or so sister
lila turns from sam a flush of guilt and regret in her face
arbogast looks at her quiet sympathetically
were always quickest to doubt people who have a record for being honest
i think shes here miss crane
where theres a boyfriend
trails off smiles encouragingly she wont be back there among the nuts and bolts
but shell be in this town
ill find her
he nods takes down the closed for lunch sign sails it to the counter opens door goes out into the street
after a quiet moment i just listened
and believed everything they told me
she stole the money
we dont want to get her in trouble
no dont bring the police in
it was her boss idea not to report it to the police
the man whose money she
he talked so loud and fast and i
i shouldve called the police
he must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it
all that cash
i ought to call the police right now
sam is she hiding here
are you two planning to go away with the money
how could i go away
im in debt up to my
smiles at the incongruity of his reply then goes serious if she did steal that money
its hard to believe she did because its hard to see why she would
unless she had some wild idea that it would help me
she havent even called you
i didnt see her
and i didnt hear from her
i need to
i need to believe something
this is the first time ive ever come up against anything i couldnt
youve led a charmed life
i just think
anything can be explained
but mary doing a thing like this
i dont know how to handle
maybe we can handle it together
he smiles encouragingly a rueful shrug i came flying up here expecting to get some explanation
for all i know she may be trying to get in touch with me at home
id better go home
a thoughtful pause i think shell contact me if she contacts anybody
why dont you stay here
when she shows up
a long study her suspicion of him evaporating you want me to stay here
shell need both of us
considers then where
can i stay
brightly first rate hotel fifty yards up the street
as he reaches for the closed for lunch sign after we check you in well go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich
then well come back here
he hangs the sign on the door ushers lila out closes door behind him
they emerge from the store and walk along to the hotel
as they enter arbogast is in the act of taking over a white ford sedan from a rental car man
they glance at him and he returns a cynical look
outside another hotel we see arbogast alight from the white car and go into new hotel
the white car speeding along the highway
arbogast going into the office we see the sign above him
a high shot showing the freeway and bates house and motel on the side old highway
a pause and then across the bottom of the picture a white car speeds by on the freeway
arbogast goes in
the white car speeding along the freeway again going in the opposite direction to last time
norman a tiny figure is seen going up the steps to his mothers house
arbogasts search is getting down in the scale
this is an entrance to a cheesy boarding house
rooms to rent etc
he looks at his list and then goes in
the white car goes by on the freeway again
arbogast goes in
heavy traffic on the freeway
a beat or two again the white car
it slows up opposite the distant motel
it makes a turn and goes back out of scene
a pause and it reappears on the old road and slowly makes its way toward the bates motel
we now see norman
he has brought out an old rocking chair and has placed it on the office porch and is sitting hunched in it
and he is darning one of his own socks
beyond the porch and norman we see the old house and can barely make out in the twilight dimness the figure of his mother seated at the window
here too there is that quality of quiet peace surrounded by a vague foreboding
now norman looks up at the sound of the approaching car
and continues looking as the car comes to a stop and arbogast gets out
arbogast gives the place a quick once over gazes at norman starts forward
in his steps and manner there is that bored routine logged quality of a man who has seen too many motels and asked question of too many hotel managers over
too short a period of time
norman rises as arbogast comes forward
shoving sock in his pocket i always forget to put the sign on but we do have vacancy
cheerfully twelve in fact
twelve cabins twelve vacancies
pleasantly in the past two days ive been to so many motels my eyes are bleary with neon
this is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large
i dont really forget the sign it just doesnt seem
points this used to be the main highway
starts for office want to register please
i dont want to trouble you just want to ask
todays linen day
i change all the beds once a week whether theyve been used or not
i hate the smell of dampness
opening office door its such a dank smell
norman is holding the door open so arbogast walks in
norman switches on the overhead light starts for the linen closet suddenly pauses turns studies arbogast who has remained standing by the door
you out to buy a motel
you said youd been to so many in two days
what was it you wanted to ask
im looking for a missing person
takes out and opens wallet and extends it as he speaks my names arbogast private investigator
takes back wallet when norman doesnt look at it trying to trace a young girl whos been missing almost a week
a look at normans frightened expression its a private matter
family wants to forgive her
smiles she isnt in trouble
forcing a smile i didnt think the police went searching for people who werent in trouble
im not the police
he waits a moment then opens closet starts counting out sheets and pillow cases keeps his back to arbogast
arbogast takes a photograph out of his pocket talks as he crosses to norman
we have reason to believe she came this way
might have stopped in this area
extends photograph which norman doesnt glance at did she stop here
no one has stopped here in weeks
mind looking at the picture before committing yourself
committing myself to what
you sure talk like a policeman
look at the picture
norman glances briefly turns away lifts sheets and pillow cases off the shelf holds them close almost protectively
at least i dont recall
she might have used an alias
mary cranes the real name but she mightve registered
interrupting i dont even bother with guests registering any more
i mean little by little you drop the formalities
more relaxed because arbogast is listening with a pleasant smile i shouldnt even bother to change the linen
i guess habits die hard
which reminds me
he goes to the wall flips a light switch
the vacancy sign
just in case
we had a couple the other night said if the sign hasnt been on theyd have thought this was an old deserted mining town or something
now theres a couple even remarking about your sign and see how easily you forgot them
you thought no one has stopped here in weeks
now try to remember if this girl
a pause a study maybe she even signed the register
because habits die hard
lets check it huh
norman says nothing
arbogast goes to the desk pulls the registry book around flips back a page or two
norman simply stares at the man
arbogast hums faintly pleasantly as he examines the pages
then yes sir
he takes a slip of paper out of his pocket lays it beside the signature in the registry book all the while nodding and smiling nicely as if this discovery
will make norman as happy as it is making him
dont know where she got marie but samuels figures
her boy friends name is sam
turns to norman the smile gone was she in disguise
or do you want to check the picture again
i didnt lie to you
i just have trouble keeping track of
arbogast has reached him the picture extended
norman looks dutifully at it
it was raining and her hair didnt look like that
damped out i guess
tell me all about her
she arrived kind of late wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early
of which morning
the following morning
no one met her
or arrived with her
she didnt call anyone
you didnt spend the whole night with her did you
how do you know she didnt make a call
she was tired
she said she had a long drive ahead of her in the morning
yes now im remembering very clearly because im picturing
when you make a picture of the moment in your mind you can remember every detail
she was sitting back there no she was standing up with some sandwich still in her hand and she said she had to drive a long way
what do you mean
you said she was sitting back there or standing rather
my private parlor
she had an awful hunger
so i made her some supper
and then she went to bed and left in the morning
i didnt even see her leave
how did she pay you
cash or check
for the cabin
and when she left she never came back
why should she
im sorry i have work to do mr
if you dont mind
i do mind
if it dont jell it aint aspic
smiles this aint jelling
i dont know what you expect me to know about
people come and go
she isnt still here is she
not at all
suppose i wanted to search the cabins all twelve
would i need a warrant
as if pleasantly exasperated look if you wont believe me go ahead
you can help me make beds if you like
laughs shakes his head come on
he starts out
arbogast pauses momentarily confused by the young mans openness
norman walks down the porch hesitates before cabin one walks on a bit toward cabin two stops turns to see if arbogast is following
arbogast has come out onto the porch but is not following
he has walked to the opposite end of the porch and is standing at its edge looking up at the old house
the upstairs window is in darkness
the neon of the vacancy and motel signs splash strange light over the scene
change your mind
arbogast does not reply
norman becomes apprehensive starts to arbogast forcing himself to remain calm and cheerful
i guess ive got one of those faces you cant help believing
to norman but continuing to stare at the house anyone at home
i live there
someone is sitting in that window
arbogast turns gazes seriously at him
confined to her room
its practically living alone
after a pause if this girl mary crane were here youd have no reason to hide her would you
of course not
if she paid you well
or if she had you say
gallantly protecting her
you wouldnt be fooled
youd know she was just using you
im not a fool
and im not capable of being fooled
not even by women
i didnt mean that as a slur on your manhood
disturbed now thats all right
maybe she could have fooled me
a rueful smile she didnt fool my mother
your mother met her
quickly can i talk to your mother
i told you shes confined
just for a moment
she might have picked up a hint youd miss
sick old women are sharp
come on i wont disturb
i have one of those breaking points like any other man believe it or not and im near it
theres just so much pushing i can take and i think
starts away toward his car pauses might save me a lot of leg work if i could just talk to your mother
but id need a warrant for that wont norman does not respond
arbogast gets in his car starts the motor
norman looks up studies the mans face his own face showing apprehension
arbogast backs the car around very slowly his gaze divided between the old house and the lighted window of cabin two
as he turns the car out his headlights light up the porch
norman stands watching him drive away
the car pulls up and arbogast gets out of car leaving motor running
as he starts to walk across the highway camera pulls away and we arbogast gets to the phone booth enters
camera starts forward and we see arbogast remove a small notebook from his pocket check on a number drop a dime in the slot and dial this number
as we reach phone booth into phone miss crane please
listens she leave a number
hangs up dials again waits lila there mr
look this isnt much but it might make you feel a little better
mary was up here
spent last saturday night at bates motel out here on the old highway
listens young fellow runs it said mary spent the night left period
listens i did question him believe me
i think i got all there was to get
just have to try to pick up the scent from here
maybe thats because i dont feel entirely satisfied
hes got a sick old mother confined type and i think she saw mary and talked to her
confined old women love to talk to strangers
listens i was but i think ill go back to the motel first
listens no you stay put lila
i should be back in an hour
listens all right
youll be happy to know what i think
i think our friend sam loomis didnt even know mary was here
smiles see you in an hour
he hangs up gets out of the phone booth
a distant view of the house and motel
there is a light on in the house
there is also a light on in normans office
we see norman emerge from his office and move along the porch toward the distant cabins
he carries sheets on his arm
he goes into the last cabin and switches the light on
into the foreground the hood of the white ford enters the scene and stops
arbogast gets out
he goes over to the motel office
arbogast goes in
arbogast looks around the empty office and calls
he goes over to the door to the parlor and enters
he looks around the bird ridden room
he stops short as he sees goes over to it
he finds it unlocked
with a quick cautious look around he opens it
straightens up and goes out
arbogast comes out and looks off
he sees the door ajar
would go along but he stops with a new thought
he turns around and looks off
comes to a decision
he goes off
dashes up the stone steps to the house
camera holds as arbogast goes up onto the porch
the house is dark within except as we can now see for a faint spill of light in the foyer light which comes from the upstairs hall
arbogast goes to the living room window looks in sees only darkness
then he goes to the door listens for along moment hears nothing
very slowly almost painfully he turns the knob of the door and pushes gently with his arm and shoulder
the door begins to open
he allows it to open just enough for him to slip through and into the foyer
arbogast gradually eases the door closed stands against it waiting
he looks up in the direction of the light sees no one
the door at the head of the stairs is closed
arbogast listens holds his breath hears what could be human sounds coming from upstairs but realizes these could also be the sounds of an old house after sunset
after a careful wait he crosses to the stairs starts up slowly guardedly placing a foot squarely on each step to test it for squeaks or groans before placing his
full weight on it
camera follows remaining on floor level but travelling along the stairway as arbogast makes his way up
we see arbogast coming up the stairs
and now we see too the door of the mothers room opening carefully and slowly
as arbogast reaches the landing the door opens and the mother steps out her hand raises high the blade of an enormous knife flashing
the knife slashes across his cheek and neck
the sudden attack throws him off balance
he stumbles back and staggers down the whole of the staircase
he frantically gropes for the balustrade as he goes backwards down the stairs
the camera follows him all the way
a wicked knife keeps thrusting itself into the foreground
as he collapses at the bottom the black head and shoulders of mrs
bates plunges into the foreground as the camera moves in to contain the raising and descending murder weapon
lila is sitting close by the phone and looks as if she hasnt moved from it in the last hour
sam is pacing occasionally stopping at the window glancing out pacing again
the ash tray close to lila is filled
there is a thick atmosphere of smoke tension and weariness in the small otherwise cozy room
at window quietly sometimes saturday night has a lonely sound
ever notice lila
unable to keep up small talk sam
he said an hour
its been three
are we just going to go on sitting here
suddenly cheerful hell be back
lets sit still and hang on okay
you have an awfully nice habit sam
which one is your pet
whenever i start contemplating the panic button your back straightens up and your eyes get that god looks out for everybody look and
i feel better
i feel better when you feel better
a pause then she rises wheres the old highway
you want to run out there bust in on arbogast and the sick old lady shake her up and maybe spoil everything arbogasts been building for the last three hours
that wouldnt be a wise thing to do
patience doesnt run in our family
sam im going out there
sam stares at her frowns in concern over her very real anxiety goes to the phone dials operator
into phone got the number of the motel out on the old highway
bates i think
why call when we can go
and maybe pass arbogast on the road
into phone thanks
he presses down the receiver releases it dials bates motel
the faint other end ringing tones can be heard repeatedly annoyingly
to lila probably on his way back right now
sam im going
hangs up and picks up his jacket youll never find it
he starts for the door
lila follows after him into the store
he pauses halfway down turns puts his hands on her arms
why cant i go out there with you
looks at her i dont know
he collects himself one of us has to be here in case arbogasts on the way
nervously just wait here
a warm smile contemplate your
he hurries down to the street door and out
camera holds on lila as she stares after sam
as she stands alone in the darkened store all the hardware seems to take on sinister shapes
among some bathroom fittings a nozzle from a shower falls onto the floor
lila turns and picks if from the floor and puts it back in its place
she turns and again looks to the deserted street with a touch of anxiety
she gives a slight unconscious shiver
tall and lonely still against the moonlight the figure of norman silhouetted
he doesnt move merely stands there at the edge of the swamp staring down at the now calm and quiet face of it
all light are out except the light in normans mothers room
and her figure can be seen sitting in the window relaxed in a high back chair her face turned into the room
after a second we hear the sound of a motor and then sams small pick up truck swings into the driveway
sam stops the motor automatically switches off headlights pauses as he observes the silence and darkness of the area
then he hops out of the cab goes quickly to the office knocks on the door
as he waits for a response he looks down the long porch studies the darkened cabins knocks again louder looks in the other direction and sees the house and the
figure at the one lit window
he stares a moment then calls loudly arbogast
the silhouette of norman
he is still
over shot very dimly comes the sound of sams voice calling again for arbogast
norman turns slowly until in silhouette we see his profile his chin lowered furtively as he looks over his shoulder in the direction of the house
there is silence for a moment and then again the sound of sam pounding at the door
the store is in darkness only the glow from the back room spilling in
with camera placed with its back to the street door we can see the distant tiny figure of lila seated and waiting in the back room beyond
there is a sound of a car pulling up
the tiny figure jumps up and runs all the way from the back room down the aisle of hardware and comes into a big head
we see lilas desperate anxious look
from her viewpoint we see sam alighting from his truck and coming toward the door of the store
he and lila exchange quiet glances
he didnt come back here
and only the old lady at home
frowning a sick old lady unable to answer the door
where could he have gone
maybe he got some definite lead
maybe he went right on
without calling me
in a hurry
sam he called me when he had nothing definite nothing but a dissatisfied feeling
dont you think hed have called if he had anything
i think he would have
lila goes quiet
sam starts toward the back room pauses at the doorway turns
lila has remained by the door looking out at the street
she feels his pause turns and for a moment they share at each other across the darkened room
lets go see al chambers
hes the deputy sheriff around here
as he starts forward
a dark quiet tree ceilinged street the small neat houses dim in the moonlight
sams pick up truck comes down the street pulls up before the house of sheriff chambers
camera moves in on sam and lila as they remain for a moment in the trucks cab staring quietly at the sleeping house
our deputy sleeps
all the lights out
must be asleep
a small exasperation does that mean we cant
im just procrastinating
people hate when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night
gives up starts out come on
he gets out of cab goes around to help lila
she is already out
camera follows them up the small path to the front door
sam presses the bell button
both he and lila are almost knocked over by the shocking clanging ear splitting blast of the bell within the house a ring which sounds more like a fire alarm
than a doorbell
he tries to smile fails
lila doesnt even try
the downstairs hall light goes on and a moment later the door is unhesitatingly opened by mrs
chambers a small lively stick of a woman wrapped in a thick flannel robe and a corona of hospitality
i hate bothering you
a cross look up at the bell its tinkerbell
a quick smile at lila al wants to be sure hell hear it if anyone rings it in the middle of the night
to sam well come on in at least
as she opens the door wide fat roses splatter the wallpaper
the stairs are carpeted
the lighting is bright
there is a perfectly fitting wall phone by the parlor arch
chambers goes to the stairway yells up
a tiny wait a smile as sam and lila enter al chambers
sam is about to close the door behind him
chambers motions for him not to scurries across the hall leans outside presses the doorbell
the ring within the house is even more shattering
she closes the door starts to the stairway pauses as the sounds of movement above come over customers
sheriff chambers comes down the stairs in a bathrobe which matches his wifes
he is a tall narrow man with a face originally destined for mount rushmore
he nods at sam looks at him with wide awake eyes and a no nonsense concern
we have a problem
to lila lets go out back and have some coca while the men are talking
no thank you
its my problem too
i dont know where to start
a look at lila except at the beginning
to sheriff this is lila crane from phoenix
shes been here for a few days looking for her sister
theres a private detective helping
and well we got a call tonight from this detective saying hed traced mary
mary is lilas sister
he traced her to that motel out on the old highway
to the sheriff bates motel
to lila he has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it
go on sam
he traced her there and called us to say he was going to question mrs
a pleasant shock norman took a wife
an old woman his mother
to sheriff quickly that was early this evening
and we havent seen or heard from him since
i went out to the motel just got back
no one was in the office and
interrupting anxiously will you help us
i think somethings wrong out there
after a considerate pause now
your sister is missing how long
she left phoenix a week ago yesterday
and no trace until
howd you and this detective come to trace her to fairvale
they thought shed be coming to me
left phoenix under her own steam
a pause she aint missing so much as shes run away
a look at sam then she stole some money
forty thousand dollars
and the police havent been able to
interrupting everyone concerned thought
if they could get her to give back the money
they could avoid involving her with the police
explains the private detective
he traced her to the bates place
whatd he exactly say when he called you
mary had been there one night and had left
with the forty thousand dollars
he didnt mention the money
anxiously what he said on the phone isnt important is it
he was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother and he didnt
thats what i want you to do something about
go out there
find somebody ask some questions
a pause im sorry if i seem over anxious to you
i keep thinking
i have to know what
i think somethings wrong too miss
but not the same thing
i think your private detective is whats wrong
as lila is about to object i think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going
probably from norman bates
and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money
he said he was dissatisfied
and was going back
to sheriff why dont you call norman and let him say just what happened if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off
itll make the girl feel better albert
at this hour
he was out when i was there
if hes back he probably isnt even in bed yet
he wasnt out when you were there
he just wasnt answering the door in the dead of night
like some people do
this fellow lives like a hermit
to sam you must remember that bad business out there
about ten years ago
ive only been here five
right now it feels like ten but
at least call
chambers goes to phone dials operator
into phone florrie the sheriff wants you to connect him with the bates motel
she hands the receiver to the sheriff
he takes it reluctantly listens to the dim sound of ringing on the other end
after a moment into phone norman
listens been just fine thanks
listen we got some worries here
did you have a man stop out there tonight
listens well this one wouldnt be a customer anyway
a private detective name of
into phone arbogast
listens and after he left
listens no its okay norman
hows it been going out there
listens well i think you oughta unload that place and open up closer in to the action a smaller place you know
into phone sorry i got you up boy
go back to sleep
yeah be glad to
hangs up turns to mrs
chambers said to give you his regards
faint irony was that all
this detective was out there and norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away
and he didnt go back
didnt see the mother
the sheriff looks long at lila shakes his head sympathetically
you shouldve called in the police the second you found your sister has skipped
you go starting private investigations using people you dont even know
what difference does that
your detective told you a nakedfaced lie
he told you he wasnt coming right back cause he wanted to question norman bates mother right
a pause then calmly norman bates mother has been dead and buried in greenlawn cemetery for the last ten years
there is a long silence
sam and lila stare at the sheriff
i helped norman pick out the dress she was buried in
it aint only local history sam its the only murder and suicide case in fairvale ledgers
bates poisoned this guy she was
involved with when she found out he was married then took a helping of the same stuff herself
ugly way to die
norman found them dead together
you mean that old woman i saw sittin in the window wasnt norman bates mother
hopefully happily maybe you saw mary
id know the difference between mary and an old woman
now wait a minute sam
you sure you saw an old woman
in the house behind the motel
i pounded and called but she
just ignored me
and you want to tell me you saw norman bates mother
it mustve been
arbogast said so too
and he said the young man wouldnt let him see her because she was ill
the sheriff stares at both of them and when he finally speaks there is an almost inaudible tone or irony in his voice
well if the woman up there is mrs
whos that woman buried out at greenlawn cemetery
norman sits in the dim one lamp light the phone next to him his hand still near it as if he had not been able to move his hand after
he is staring at the shrike like bird which is perched on the lamp shade
decision and resolution are beginning to show in his face
suddenly he rises starts quickly out of the room tries to switch off the lamp as he goes and in so doing succeeds only in knocking the bird off the
he watches it fall does not try to catch it
it hits the floor with a thud and sawdust spills out
he stares sadly at it for a moment then tends down scoops up the sawdust tries to press it into the split seam picks up the bird puts it in
then he puts out the lamp goes out crosses the darkened office and goes outside
norman comes off the porch walks to the path and directly up to the house opens the door and goes in
norman goes up pauses one moment outside his mothers door then opens it and goes in leaving the door open
for a moment we hear only normans low quiet voice his words indistinguishable
then we hear the cold shot of his mothers derisive laughter
i am sorry boy but you do manage to look ludicrous when you give me orders
sharp laughter all gone no
i will not hide in the fruit cellar
a shrill laugh think im fruity huh
hard cold again im staying right here
this is my room and no one will drag me out of it
least of all my big bold son
rising now anxiously theyll come now mother
he came after the girl and now someone will come after him
how long do you think you can go on
mother please just for a few days just so they wont find you
mimicking just for a few days
furious in that dank fruit cellar
you hid me there once boy and you wont do it again
not ever again
now get out
a pause quiet i told you to get out boy
a longer pause norman
what do you think youre going to do
dont you touch me
a pause then cajolingly all right son put me down and ill go
ill go on my own two feet
i can go on my own two feet cant i
during all this the camera has been slowly creeping up the stairs
it does not stop at the top however but continues on the same high angle that we had in scene
she starts to laugh a terrible sound like an obscene melody
ill carry you mother
norman comes out of the room his mother held in his arms her head leaning against his shoulder
he carries her down the stairs along the lower landing to the cellar stairs and then down those stairs to the basement
an overcast morning but a sunny faced crowd
the service is just over there is contentment and peace and just a little i went to church smugness in the faces of the churchgoers as they come out of
the chapel and spread their separate ways away
amongst the crowd waiting and searching the faces are sam and lila
in their expressions there is no peace no contentment
camera moves in close
they are not speaking
lila looks as if she has had no sleep
suddenly sam becomes alert takes lilas arm starts toward the church
camera moves with them stops as they approach sheriff and mrs
the sheriff stares rather sympathetically at lila
chambers smiles nicely
we thought if you didnt mind wed go out to the motel with you
hes already been
went out before service
have you two had breakfast
to sheriff not a question you didnt find anything
here lets clear the path
he moves away and the others follow
camera pans them to the curb
interrupting did he say anything about my sister
just what he told your detective
she used a fake name saw the register myself
saw the whole place as a matter of fact
that boy is alone there
you mustve seen an illusion sam
now i know youre not the seeing illusion type
but no woman was illusion there and i dont believe in ghosts so there it is
i still feel
can see you do
sorry i couldnt make you feel better
you want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person
and the theft is what you want to do
sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law thats the sooner youll stand a chance of your sister bein picked up
how about that
i dont know
come over and do the reporting at the house round dinner time
make it nicer
you too sam
she smiles brightly as if having invited them over to discuss this years charity fandango takes the sheriffs arm starts away
the sheriff nods as he goes
sam and lila are alone now at the curb before the deserted chapel
for a long moment they just stand there their faces as gray and overcast as the sky
maybe i am the seeing illusions type
sam takes her arm starts walking her up the street toward the spot where his pick up truck is parked
camera follows them
want me to drop you at the hotel
or you want to come over to the store
lila does not answer
they reach the truck
lila looks directly at sam as he helps her into the cab
i wont feel satisfied unless i got out there sam
neither will i
he slams the door hurries around truck gets into drivers seat starts motor
as the truck drives off for a moment both are silent sam watching the road as if there were other cars on it lila staring at nothing in particular except
perhaps her own inner fear
i wonder if well ever see mary again
of course we will
sam looks as if hed like to say something humorous something to cheer her
he remains silent
we lived together all our lives
when we woke up one morning and found ourselves orphans mary quit college and got a job so i could go to college
whered you go to college
i got a job too
a pause i wonder if that hurt her my not letting her sacrifice for me
some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you dont let them
almost to himself she was willing to lick the stamps
lila looks quizzically at him is too concerned to pursue it
i wonder so many things about her now
why she never told me about you
funny when you think theres an answer to everything you think you know all the answers
we were going to get married
are going to get married
do you know how i found out about you
i found one of your letters
it was a nice letter sam
this is the old highway
when you were able to marry her shed have presented you all shiny and proper
she always tried to be proper
watch your tenses
she always tries to be proper
sam slows the truck to a stop sighs starts to light up a cigarette
lila looks questioningly and impatiently at him
you going to wait here for me
im going with you
but wed better decide what were going to say and do when we walk in
were going to register
as man and wife
and get shown to a cabin
and then search every inch of that place inside and
you wont believe it
starts motor but this will be the first time ive ever pulled one of those man and wife renting cabin capers
a tiny smile first in hours i believe it
as truck starts to drive on the place is empty and silent and washed dirty by the deep gray of the cloudy sky
we see sams truck turning into the driveway and pulling to a stop
after a moment sam and lila get out of the truck
close on sam and lila as they meet on the porch side of the truck
the motel office and the house beyond can be seen in b
sam and lila merely stare for a moment then turn and gaze up at the house
there is no figure in the window and the shade is drawn
same goes to the office door peers in knocks opens door enters
lila remains on the driveway beside the truck
close angle on norman standing by the window
he has pulled the curtains very slightly apart is staring out and down at the motel his eyes studying the lone figure of lila who is standing by the truck
and looking up at the house
norman studies her and as her eyes look up at this very window he closes the curtains turns away
we see the suspicion and fear in his face the surge of panic and his struggle to contain it
then he goes away
camera remains on window shooting out and down and through the frail curtains we can see sam as he comes out of the motel office and joins lila
unconsciously whispering i wonder where norman bates does his hermiting
someone was at that window
i saw the curtain move
sam takes lilas arm
he starts with her toward the path which leads to the old house
camera pans with them and as they turn around the office corner they see norman coming down the path toward them
they pause and norman pauses
he does not smile nor speak
his usual grin and soft friendliness are gone containment and impassivity lie in their place
cheerfully just coming up to ring for you
coming forward i suppose you want a cabin
wed hoped to make it straight to san francisco but we dont like the look of that sky
looks like a bad day coming
norman walks past sam giving him the sort of quick disapproving glance one gives a man who is obviously lying goes onto the porch and into the office
sam and lila follow norman
norman crosses to the desk goes behind it takes the key to cabin number twelve off the keyboard
sam and lila have entered and are almost to the desk counter by this time
ill take you to
better sign in first hasnt we
sam eyes scan the counter looking for a registration book
it isnt necessary
interrupting with a friendly cheerfulness uh uh
my boss is paying for this trip
ninety percent business
and he wants practically notarized receipts
i better sign in and get a receipt
norman stares at sam as if hed like to yell at him call him liar
instead he reaches under the desk counter brings out the registration book
lila moves closer studies the book as sam signs in
sam signs joe and mrs
the signature and city of marie samuels and after it the notation cabin one can be clearly seen three registrations above sams
when sam has finished he closes book hands it back to norman
norman does not take it starts out from behind counter
ill get your bags
after a stare ill show you the cabin
as he starts for the door sam laughs
norman stops turns looks at him
first time ive seen it happen
to lila check in any place in this country without bags and you have to pay in advance
sam smiles as if at a funny remark takes a bill out of his pocket
norman returns to sam takes the extended bill is about to start out again
norman goes reluctantly behind counter lays down the key to cabin twelve takes a receipt book out of the drawer under counter starts to write
lila steps up to the desk picks up the key quickly starts out
ill start ahead
norman looks up gazes her as she goes out door
lila comes along the porch pauses before cabin one tries the door
she closes it quickly as she hears sam and norman coming out of the motel office continues on down the porch
to norman who is following dont bother yourself
well find it
he goes on down the porch doesnt even glance at cabin one walks quickly and catches up to lila just as she reaches cabin twelve
camera remains with norman who is standing by the office door looking after sam and lila his face alert and no longer impassive
he waits a moment after they have closed their cabin door then crosses to the pickup truck
camera moves with him
he studies the truck then leans in through the drivers window twists the registration card around reads it
it gives the correct name and address of sam loomis
norman comes back out of the window glances once more toward cabin twelve then at the old house
his suspicions are confirmed and now there is the relaxation of relief in his face
he takes on a purposeful air turns strides up the path up onto the porch of the house opens the door goes in
lila is at the cabins rear window looking out straining for a glimpse of the old house which cannot be seen from the window of this cabin
she turns frustrated anxious
sam is standing at the foot of the bed staring at the smooth coverlet his brow creased in a sadness
we should have asked for cabin one
the one mary was in
im glad we didnt
he pulls his eyes from the bed crosses to the desk sits wearily lights a cigarette
lila watches him for a moment feels a real compassion goes to the bed sits on its edge turns again and looks at sams back
we have to go into that cabin and search it sam
no matter what were afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt
a pause do you think if something happened it happened there
a pause then sam if you owned a useless business like this motel
one you probably couldnt even sell
what would you need to get away to start a new business somewhere else
as sam studies her forty thousand dollars
how could we prove
an almost hopeless laugh well if he opens a new motel on the new highway
say a year from now
there must be some proof that exists right now
something that proves he got that money away from mary
what makes you sound so certain
sam he liked me
or felt sorry for me
and he was starting to feel the same about you
i heard it when he called
in his voice a caring
he wouldnt have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us
unless he was stopped
and he was stopped so he must have found out something
sam considers a moment nods agreement rises
well start with cabin one
he goes to the door opens it slightly looks out then back to lila if he sees us
were just taking the air
lila goes to the door
he holds it open and she goes out
sam closes the door joins lila takes her hand
together they walk along the porch in the direction of cabin one
they pause before the door of cabin one
sam motions lila to wait to hold still then goes on to the office opens the door calls in bates
he waits there is no response
he goes in and in a moment comes back out closes the door goes to lila
she has already opened the door of cabin one and has started to enter
the blinds are closed and the room is almost night dark
sam comes in after lila closes the door behind him
for a moment they just gaze at the room as if willing it to tell them some satisfactory story
then in dark silence they begin to search going methodically and thoroughly through all drawers the closet the desk searching under the bed and in dark corners not knowing what
they expect to find and yet expecting to find some thing
lila opens the bathroom door looks in
the windowless room is very dark
she switches on the light goes in
sam moves toward the bathroom is about to follow her in when he notices which room it is and automatically catches himself up backs out
look at how clean it is
the one in our cabin is clean
but this is clean
sam goes in glances around nods
lila goes through the medicine cabinet finds nothing but a glass and two tiny tabs of soap
sam leans against the door jamb looks at the tub the shower pipe above it
he continues to stare more interested suddenly as if bothered by some off key evidence he cant put his finger on
then he looks at the shower curtain rod
and realizes there is no shower curtain
he frowns is about to say something when lila who has been momentarily out of shot interrupts
sam turns camera turns and we see lila is standing above the toilet bowl a tiny piece of wet paper stuck to the tip of her right index finger
what is it
it didnt get washed down
the kind you tear up and get rid of
extending her finger toward sam some figure has been added to or subtracted from
sam lifts the piece of paper off her finger studies it takes out his wallet presses the wet scrap to his drivers license shield puts it back in the wallet
and puts the wallet away
thats proof mary was here
it would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to
reminding bates never denied mary was here
a thought but maybe this proves that bates found out about the money
do we simply ask him where hes hidden it
sam that old woman whoever she is
i think she told arbogast something
and i want her to tell us the same thing
she starts out of the bathroom
sam takes hold of her arm stops her
you cant go up there
camera starts to pan away from them moves slowly over the room very slowly
lets find him
one of us can keep him occupied while the other gets to the woman
you wont be able to hold him still if he doesnt want to be held
and i dont like you going into that house alone lila
camera has panned clear across to the opposite wall now and is moving up closer and closer to the tiny flowered wall paper finally closing in on one small rosebud
i can handle a sick old woman
now we see that the rosebud has been cut out that this is the reverse side of the hole norman peeped through to watch mary
and we see the pupil of normans eye now
ill find bates and keep him occupied
the eye moves away and there is a brief flash of light before the hole is covered on the other side by the wall hung painting
they are about to start out
sam stops her again
wait a minute
if you get anything out of the mother
a thought can you find your way back to town
as lila nods yes if you do get anything dont stop to tell me
lila nods quickly hurries to the door
sam gets to it first opens it a slight crack looks out then opens it wide enough for lila and himself to pass through
angle close on cabin one as lila comes out turns to her left goes along porch toward cabin twelve
sam remains at the door then turns right heading for the path
as he passes the office he is shocked to see norman standing just inside the open door
looking for me
recovering yes matter of fact
the friendly grin the wifes taking a nap and
i can never keep quiet enough for her
so i thought id look you up and
satisfied with your cabin
sam starts into the office
just before going in he glances down the long porch sees lila standing outside the door of cabin twelve waves her a tiny all clear signal
camera angles to include lila and her point of view
she watches sam disappear into the office waits until she hears the door close then looks about for another way to reach the house
she sees the small alley at the end of this l of cabins starts toward it
behind the motel lila hesitates
she looks ahead
the old house standing against the sky
lila moves forward
the camera approaching the house
lila glances toward the back of normans parlor
she moves on
the house coming nearer
lila looks up at the house
she moves forward purposefully
the house and the porch
lila stops at the house and looks up
she glances back
she turns to the house again
the camera mounts the steps to the porch
lila puts out her hand
lilas hand pushes the door open
we see the hallway
lila enters past camera
lila closes the door remains by it for a moment quiet listening
her eyes scan the layout the closed door which leads off the hallway to the dining room on the right and the parlor on the left
down at the end of the hall is the kitchen the door wide open the room beyond dim and silent
she notices the stairs leading down to the basement stares at them then back to the stairs leading to the second floor
she starts forward and seems about to investigate the parlor and dining room
norman is behind the counter standing staring at sam who is sitting relaxedly on a small sofa
norman has the look of one who is protecting himself as if the counter were a protective wall against the threatening world across it
cheerfully as if after a self conscious pause ive been doing all the talking so far havent i
i always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance
yet there you are doing all the listening
a pause you are alone here arent you
as norman does not reply it would drive me crazy
that would be a rather extreme reaction wouldnt it
lightly just an expression
more seriously what i meant was
id do just about anything
to get away
lila is halfway up the stairs
as she climbs she is startled by the creaks and groans of the old wood of the steps
she steps more carefully
camera remains at foot of stair tilting up as lila climbs
she pauses at the head of the stair
the door on her right which opens into the mothers room is closed
to her left is another door half open
directly before her is a third door closed
she holds a long moment trying to picture in her mind which room would look out on the front of the house decides chooses the correct door the one on
she goes to it knocks lightly
we hear lilas second knock then faintly her soft call
there is quiet for a moment then the door begins to open and we see lila
she stands on the threshold looking in at the room instantly disturbed by it almost chilled her expression indicating an impulse to close the door and go away from this
after a moment she enters leaving the door open behind her
camera pulls back and away and we now see the room as lila sees it
it is ornate damask and mahogany thick and warm and ripe an olla podrida of mismated furnishings and bric a brac of the last century
the bed is four poster but uncanoped the dressing table is fancy and flounced with satin there is a great chiffonier a big doored wardrobe a large oval full length
pier glass this against the wall directly opposite the door a satin recamier an upholstered armchair by the window a white marble fireplace its grate cold but piled with ashes
and there is in the room an unmistakably live quality as if even though it is presently unoccupied it has not been long vacated by some musty presence
lila glances at the bed
the damask coverlet is thrown over it but it is not neat there is the imprint of a body on it a body which obviously has slept in a curled
up womb like position
lila stares at it for a moment up then goes to the dressing table
its top is scattered with boxes and jars of cosmetics and creams traces of fresh powder an opened bottle or perfume a comb and a brush with traces of hair
in its bristles
lila moves on catches a glimpse of herself in the pier glass is startled turns away goes to the chiffonier is about to open a drawer sees the high wardrobe
out of the corner of her eyes goes to it hesitantly
she opens one door
fresh clean well pressed dresses hang neatly
lila opens the other door
the sweaters and dresses and robes hang freely none in moth proof storage type bags
there is even a well brushed collar of foxes
along the floor of the wardrobe is a line of clean polished shoes
lila stares then closes the door turns looks once again over the whole room starts out lila comes out of the mothers room closes the door behind her looks down
the stairs then starts across the hall to the room whose door is half open
the room within is dark the shades drawn full
lila pauses on the threshold reaches in feels the wall throws on a switch
sam has risen is standing by the counter now
im not saying you shouldnt be contented here im just doubting that you are
i think if you saw a chance to get out from under
youd unload this place
angrily this place
this isnt a place
its my only world
i grew up in that house back there
i was a happy child
my mother and i
we were more than happy
and now that your mothers dead
norman snaps a sharp fast ugly look at him
my mother is not dead
softly i didnt think so
lila is standing in the doorway staring at the room in sick dismay
the room is grotesque a horrible ludicrous fantasy of childhood held beyond the point of decency
it is a small room
the walls are fancied with romping silhouettes of teddy bears and sailboats and carousels and fat cows jumping over aghast moons
the bed is small far too short for a man of normans height
and yet the rumpled covers indicate that it is in this bed that norman sleeps
next to the bed is an old fashioned toy chest
on its top there are a bird in a cage lamp a plain bound book and an ash tray filled with ashes and cigarette stubs
a grown mans shirt hangs on a childs clothes tree
against one wall there is a narrow high bookcase filled with thick unchildish looking books
on the small white chest of drawers there is an old childs victrola
the record on the turntable is discovered on close inspection to be beethovens eroica symphony
lila studies the room fascinated and repelled
she glances at the bookcase comes into the room goes to the bookcase and pulls out a thick large plain bound book
she opens it
her eyes go wide in shock
and then there is disgust
she slams the book closed drops it
norman behind the counter has moved back against the wall
sam is still on the other side of the counter but is leaning forward his eyes hard on normans face
normans face is no longer expressionless
it has the stark high sheen of a cornered animal
pressing you look frightened
have i been saying something frightening
i dont know what youve been saying
ive been talking about your mother
about your motel
how are you going to do it
buy a new one
in a new town
where you wont have to hide your mother
where will you get the money to do that bates
or do you already have it
a lot of it
leave me alone
forty thousand dollars
leave me alone
he is close to panic now
he turns swiftly dashes back into his private parlor
sam goes quickly around the counter follows
norman hears sam following wants to run to never be reached by this man
he crosses the small room drawn to the rear window as if he might fly through it
sam enters pauses
norman turns back against the window as unable to fly away as are the many still stuffed birds
sam registers a brief flicker of reaction when he sees the birds but continues to gaze at norman hard
i bet your mother knows where the money is
and what you did to get it
and i think shell tell us
something self assured and confident in sams tone gives norman a new more terrified alarm
he turns his head glances out the window at the old house
he looks back at sam and there is terror in his voice
wheres that girl
the girl you came with
where is she
sam does not respond smiles a half smile turns to examine a stuffed owl
norman looks back at the house
a horrible groan oh god
lila shaken and disturbed almost sickened is coming out of normans room
she has left the light on
she pauses in the middle of the landing looks at the closed door opposite the stairs goes to it opens it sees that it is the bathroom pulls the door
to turns starts toward the stairs
sam is lying on the floor face downward unmoving
a candlestick is on the floor close by his head still rocking as if just dropped
over shot comes the sound of normans footsteps and camera turns in time to catch a brief glimpse of him going out into the office almost at a run
lila is on the top step looking down toward camera
she is listening hoping to hear some human sound some sound she might follow pursue
she hears nothing
she starts down the stairs
just below the halfway step she looks at the front door sees out through the door window norman coming
for a moment lila panics then she hurries down the steps cannot go in the direction of the front door remembers the stairway behind her turns and runs in that
the sound of norman bounding up the porch steps can be heard
lila turns and dashes down the stairs which lead to the basement going down far enough to conceal herself crouching there
norman enters the hallway closes the door softly listens
he glances once in the direction of the basement stairs
he seems about to smile when suddenly all expression vanishes from his face and he appears to enter a no place no time state
he crosses to the stairway goes up
lila remains crouched on the basement stairs listening to the sounds of norman
his footsteps on the stairs followed by the fast noises of doors opening of fast moving about an upstairs room
convinced that he is searching the upstairs for her she decides to chance an escape
she starts up the steps is about to turn into the hallway when her eye is caught by a glimmer of light down in the basement
she pauses looks down sees the crack of light coming from behind the not entirely closed door to the fruit cellar
the swift moving sounds of norman continue to come from upstairs
lila is torn knows she should get out of the house while she has the chance is unable to resist the impulse to check that hidden looking room down below
a room in which she desperately believes there must lie some answer to what happened to mary
she turns and goes softly and quickly down the stairs
lila reaches the bottom stops listens hears the stairboards creaking as footsteps fall hard and measured upon them
she turns pulls open the fruit cellar door looks in
the woman is sitting in a comfortable chair the back of the chair and the woman turned to the door
lila calls a harsh frightened whisper
lila goes into the room
lila goes to the chair touches it
the touch disturbs the figure
it starts to turn slowly stiffly a clock wise movement
lila looks at it in horror
it is the body of a woman long dead
the skin is dry and pulled away from the mouth and the teeth are revealed as in the skeletons smile
the eyes are gone from their sockets the bridge of the nose has collapsed the hair is dry and wild the cheeks are sunken the leathery brown skin is powdered
and rouged and flaky
the body is dressed in a high neck clean well pressed dress obviously recently laundered and hand ironed
the movement of this stuffed ill preserved cadaver turning as if in response to lilas call and touch is actually graceful ballet like and the effect is terrible and obscene
lila gazes for one flicker of a deathly moment then begins to scream a high piercing dreadful scream
and lilas scream is joined by another scream a more dreadful horrifying scream which comes from the door behind her
screaming ayeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee am norma bates
his face is contorted
he wears a wild wig a mockery of a womans hair
he is dressed in a high neck dress which is similar to that worn by the corpse of his mother
his hand is raised high poised to strike at lila
there is a long breadknife in it
close on her face
she is dumb struck
her eyes are screaming
as he is about to start forward a mans hand reaches in from the doorway behind grabs normans wrist
sam comes through the door still holding tight to the wrist pulling back the arm and at the same time throwing himself at norman football tackle style
norman and sam struggling
the wild fury in normans face the mad noise of his screams and vile curses
the terrified fight to the death look of sam
the still staring lila
a close of her face she appears to be watching and enjoying the fight
over the shot the sounds of the struggle the screams of norman
there are many people gathered about the steps the curious and the concerned and the morbid
at the curb a couple of newspaper cars two or three police cars and a mobile unit truck from the local television outlet
there is noise and chattering as questions are asked and answers given and the sounds of traffic and of the television equipment being moved into the courthouse for on the
scene reporting and the stern voices of policemen trying to keep people back
the scene has a bright glare about it that quality of sudden light thrown on a fearful darkness
a policeman trying to make way for the television men muttering keep back etc
to the spectators
a television man carrying a piece of equipment goes through door and camera follows him into the courthouse vestibule
here too there is a crowd composed of policemen reporters television men
the television men we have been following stops beside a policeman
indicating the front door he has just come in through you think theyll take him out that way
looking at waiting crowd shrugging probably have to
a rueful smile besides the taxpayers hate it when something gets slipped out the back door on them
over this exchange the buzz of other voices the movement of men
camera moves on down the corridor gets to the door of the office of the chief of police just as a young fellow with a carton box filled with paper
containers of sent out for coffee reaches this door
camera holds as the coffee boy pauses a moment then goes into the room
lila is seated in a chair sam standing close by
a bit apart from them we see sheriff chambers in quiet conference with the chief of police the county sheriff the district the coffee boy stands in the doorway
sam goes to him takes a container of coffee from the box carries it to lila checking the notation on the lid as he goes
quietly its regular
ruefully i could stand something regular
sam smiles encouragingly hands her the coffee
sheriff chambers enters shot gives sam a container of coffee he has brought for him
sam takes it nods a thank you
for a moment no one speaks
lila looks badly shaken sam disheveled but contained
you two can go on home if you like
a sympathetic look at lila making that statement was enough for one night
to lila want to
im all right
ill feel better when all this is explained
if it can be
sam looks a question at sheriff chambers
chambers shrugs doubtfully
if anybody gets any answers itll be the fellow talking to him now
even i couldnt reach norman
and he knows me
to lila you warm enough miss
lila is about to answer when she sees someone come into the room and rises anxiously
sam and sheriff chambers turn follow her gaze
a young man with a serious frowning face has just come into the room
he is dr
simon the psychiatrist
he goes to the desk where the box of coffee containers has been placed takes up a container
did he talk to you
i got the whole story
but not from norman
i got it from
everyone gazes at him mystified
he speaks as he removes lid from coffee container
norman bates no longer exists
he only half existed to begin with
now the other half has taken over
probably for all time
with difficulty did he kill my sister
look if youre trying to lay a lot of psychiatric groundwork for some sort of plea this fellow would like to cop
a psychiatrist doesnt lay the groundwork
he merely tries to explain it
but my sister is
to chambers the private investigator too
if you drag that swamp somewhere in the vicinity of the motel
to the chief of police have you any unsolved missing persons cases on your books
nods astounded then did he confess to
interrupting as i said the mother
pauses goes on afresh to understand it as i understood it hearing it from the mother
that is from the mother half of normans mind you have to go back ten years
to the time when norman murdered his mother and her lover
a pause then as no one interrupts he was already dangerously disturbed had been ever since his father died
his mother was a clinging demanding woman
and for years the two of them lived as if there was no one else in the world
then she met a man and it seemed to norman she threw him over for this man
that pushed him over the thin line
and he killed them both
matricide is probably the most unbearable crime of all
and most unbearable to the son who commit it
so he had to erase the crime at least in his own mind
a pause he stole her corpse
and a weighted coffin was buried
he hid the body in the fruit cellar even treated it to keep it as well as it would keep
and that still wasnt enough
she was there but she was a corpse
so he began to think and speak for her gave her half his life so to speak
at times he could be both personalities carry on conversations
at other times the mother half took over completely
he was never all norman but he was often only mother
and because he was so pathologically jealous of her he assumed she was as jealous of him
therefore if he felt a strong attraction to any other woman the mother side of him would go wild
to lila when norman met your sister he was touched by her
and aroused by her
he wanted her
and this set off his jealous mother and
mother killed the girl
after the murder norman returned as if from a deep sleep
and like a dutiful son covered up all traces of the crime he was convinced his mother had committed
why was he
dressed like that
hes a transvestite
a man who dresses in womans clothing in order to achieve a sexual change
is a transvestite
but in normans case he was simply doing everything possible to keep alive the illusion of his mother being alive
and whenever reality came too close when danger or desire threatened that illusion hed dress up even to a cheap wig he brought and hed walk about the house sit
in her chair speak in her voice
he tried to be his mother
a sad smile and now he is
a pause thats what i meant when i said i got the story from the mother
she thinks norman has been taken away
because of his crimes
she insists she did nothing that norman committed all the murders just to keep her from being discovered
she even smiled a bit coquettishly as she said that
of course she feels badly about it
but also somewhat relieved to be as she put it free of norman at last
a pause when the mind houses two personalities there is always a battle
in normans case the battle is over
and the dominant personality has won
lila begins to weep softly for mary for arbogast for norman for all the destroyed human beings of this world
sam bends beside her puts his arm about her comforts her
to simon and the forty thousand dollars
who got that
these were murders of passion not profit
a police guard puts his head in the door speaks in a near whisper to the chief of police
the guard is carrying a folded blanket over his arm
he feels a little chill
can i bring him this blanket
the chief of police nods
the guard goes away and camera follows him out of the room and out into the hallway
guard moves through the waiting men heading down the corridor
a narrower corridor in the rear of the building
of shot we see a door the top half of which is wire covered glass
a guard in uniform is posted by the door looking reprovingly at the two or three people trying to get a glance into the room
the police guard carrying the blanket comes down this corridor goes to the door
camera moves close
the uniformed guard opens the door allows the man to go in
shot is raked so that we can not see into the room
after a moment the guard comes out and the uniformed guard closes and locks the door and we the walls are white and plain
there is no window
there is no furniture except the straight back chair in which norman sits in the center of the room
the room has a quality of no whereness of calm separation from the world
the police guard has placed the blanket on normans knees
norman as we come upon him is lifting the blanket unfolding it
his face although without makeup and without the surrounding softness of the wig has a certain femininity about it a softness about the mouth and a kind of arch womanliness
about the brows
calmly norman places the blanket about his shoulders as if it were a cashmere shawl
camera remains in a position so that our view of norman is a full one
when the shawl is in position and norman is settled we hear over shot the voice of his mother coming from the calm of his thoughts
when a mother has to speak the words that condemn her own son
but i couldnt allow them to believe that i would commit murder
a pause theyll put him away now
as i should have
he was always
and in the end he intended to tell them i killed those girls
and that man
as if i could do anything except just sit and stare
like one of his stuffed birds
a pause well they know i cant even move a finger
and i wont
ill just sit here and be quiet
just in case they do
a fly buzzes close and then continues buzzing and flying about normans face
theyre probably watching me
well let them
let them see what kind of a person i am
a pause as the fly lights on normans hand im not going to swat that fly
i hope they are watching
and theyll know
and theyll say
why she wouldnt even harm a fly
norman continues to gaze ahead into nothing
as end titles fade in we see the swamp the chain of a tow truck
the chain is attached to marys car
the car is coming out of the swamp
