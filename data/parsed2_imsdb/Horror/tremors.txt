wilson brent maddocks tremors written by s
wilson brent maddock the high desert absolutely silent a vast hard land scape stretching away to distant mountains
the silence is broken by hoof beats
its a simple cabin dwarfed by a big ramshackle barn
edgar deems s a weathered desert rat of a hermit is walking his donkey around in circles
now rattling toward them down an endless dirt road comes an old sun bleached buick
it stops and out leans old fred s wearing a sweat stained fedora
the two friends nod
hows she doing
she wants to lay down
im a little worried
old fred climbs out with a bushel basket of carrots
well i brung her something i know she likes
damn fred you cant give away all those
i got vegetables coming out my ears
usually the varmints eat up half my crop but lately i aint so much as seen a gopher or a jack rabbit nowheres
if that aint the truth
and i count on them for a little bit of stew meat
thank you fred
edgar takes the carrots and feeds one to the donkey
edgar contd here you go justine
look what fred brought you
we playing cards tonight
i think im gonna be sitting up with her
id do the same
well catch you thursday
the men nod and old fred drives off
close up of the donkeys hooves thumping along as edgar leads her to the barn
edgar contd lets get you out of the sun for a spell
edgar contd ill get you some fresh water
but suddenly we hear the donkey restlessly stomping its hooves and braying
edgar turns concerned
now we hear an odd sound
the donkey gets more and more frantic
the barn shudders violently
frightened birds explode from the eaves
dust puffs from every old seam
roof shingles rain down
edgar stares in amazement
edgar contd some kind of earthquake then another sound the donkey starts screeching in wild panic
edgar contd justine hang on
edgar races back to the barn and flings open the doors
dust swirls through the air
but the barn in empty
now edgar is hit by a ghastly stench
he staggers back and covers his nose with a handkerchief
then he sees splattered across the walls blood what in the name of jehovah
he raises his arms above the door frame
when he lowers them hes holding a gauge shotgun
he races outside ready to shoot but theres nothing as far as the eye can see
the sun lights up spectacular sheer cliffs which plunge feet from a ruggedly beautiful high desert plateau
at the top of the cliffs silhouetted against the dawn a lone cow boy seems to gaze in deep contemplation at the sunrise
as we move in we realize hes actually peeing over the cliff
this is valentine mckee
smart and good looking val has nevertheless managed to underachieve brilliantly
he coasts through life following the path of least resistance which has brought him to this dubious rustic existence on the edge of civilization
but lately hes beginning to wonder why he hasnt accomplished more in his years
as a few sleepy cows gaze at him sleepy val shuffles over to his battered old pickup truck
a hand painted sign on the door reads v e all types of jobs
indeed the pick up bed is jumbled with tools and supplies for every conceivable odd job and the noisily snoring form of his partner huddled in a dirty sleeping bag
val raps on the side of the truck
softly good morning mr
bassett this is your wake up call
please move your fat ass
no response from the sleeping bag
val stares at the cows chewing their cud and perks up as he gets an idea
he gently steps onto the trucks running board then suddenly starts jumping up and down as hard as he can rocking the truck violently
val contd the sleeping bag tries to get up and run for it
it tumbles out of the back of the pickup
while val laughs uproar iously earl basset claws his way out of the bag looks around wildly and finds himself staring at three motionless cows
you dumb shit
earl is a good ol boy who has lived his life just like val drifting from job to job
he knows why he hasnt accom plished anything and often tries to impart his hard won wisdom to val but the last thing the younger man wants is advice
the men begin a silent ritual earl gropes through his pockets for a cigarette but only finds a lighter
meanwhile val digs in his pockets coming up with cigarettes but no lighter
typical of these two each guy always has half of what he needs
eventually they sort it out trading the necessary implements
earl reaches for a coffee pot on a battered coleman stove on the tailgate
but its cold
you didnt cook breakfast
did it yesterday
franks and beans
tries to recall no
it was eggs
i did eggs
hell you did
earl raises his fist
this is the challenge and it instantly triggers the partners conflict resolution technique
they solve all disputes using the childrens game of scissors rock paper
earl raises his fist in response
the game is played swiftly and silently one two three
on three val mimes paper open hand
earl mimes scissors two extended fingers
scissors cuts paper
val has lost
he shrugs and starts pumping up the stove fuel tank
val contd well when im your age ill probably forget what i eat too
val and earl are restringing a dilapidated and seemingly endless barbed wire fence
a few bored cows watch them
how many cows does it take to make a stampede
is it like three or more
is there a minimum speed
shakes his head i was in one
a bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree
three hundred head going hell bent for the horizon
wasnt so damn funny i can tell you
earls hand slips and the fence snags him right through his thick glove
earl contd ow
is this a job for intelligent men
if there was one nearby id probably ask him
i keep thinking if we were but half serious about money we should quit being hired hands and
mock serious handymen earl
whatever the hell we are we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment
val gestures to the vastness around them
what and give up all this personal freedom
val guides the truck down a tortuous rocky almost impas sable trail
it takes full concentration as he fights the steering wheel shifts rides the brake and leans out trying to pick a decent route
earl braces his feet on the dash and munches breakfast a raw hot dog right out of the package
goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year
shrugs has a lot of rain
earl pulls a box of hershey bars from under the seat
theres only one bar left
he sets the box down between them
val glances at it and raises his fist the challenge
one two three
val mimes paper earl mimes rock
val takes the bar
pointing ahead youre gonna get us hung up
do not talk to the driver
the truck lurches to a stop its frame caught on a big rock
val glares at earl
the pick up turns from a dirt road onto an old paved road
what do we have next
earl consults a crumpled list pulled from inside his hat
digging that waterhole for nestor
burt and heathers place is closer
lets do their kitchen today
do nestor tomorrow
nestors out of town tomorrow
we dont dig today
we dont get paid today
damn it valentine you never plan ahead
you never take the long view
hell here it is monday and im already working on wednesday
squints dubiously at his schedule it is monday right
but val is peering at the desert up ahead
off the road a ways is a small toyota pick up truck and beside it a lone figure trying to flag them down
who the hells that
thats not whats his name
the grad student
nah its september
must be the new one
the new one
thats supposed to be a girl
earl braces himself knowing what val will do
val swerves the truck wildly off the road barreling across the desert
val contd almost praying you will have long blonde hair big green eyes nice full breasts that stand up and say hello ass that wont quit
and legs legs that go all the way up
earl shakes his head mildly bemused as they slide to a stop in a cloud of dust
val looks out hopefully
the dust clears
he sees her rhonda lebeck
vals eyes do an expert vertical scan short brown hair small brown eyes so so chest legs hidden in baggy dungarees
laden with a portable computer notebooks and some seismograph printouts she stares at him through tilted glasses
her little pick up truck is loaded with geology field equipment
she shakes vals hand firmly
brightly hi im rhonda
im up here for the semester
and you have to be val and earl
ive heard all about you
we deny everything
listen got a question for you
do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that
why would they
well im supposed monitor these seismographs
you know they measure vibrations
yeah vibrations in the ground
yeah well im getting what i refer to scientifically as weird vibes
every sensor ive got is giving me strange readings
i mean the school has had these machines up here three years and theyve never recorded anything like this
well well ask around
let you know if we hear of anything
god i hope theyre not screwed up
i might have to bag the whole semester
anyway sorry to bother you
nice meeting you
hope you get it sorted out
rhonda unhappily turns back to her equipment as val and earl drive off
earl glances over at val with a gleam in his eye
you know if you wanted we could take a look at those seismographs for her
what the hell do we know about seismographs
but it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her
goddamnit valentine you wont go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours a to z
and is dumber than my hind end
like that bobby lynn dexter
val flips down the trucks sunvisor
tapes to it are snap shots of nearly identical blonde bimbos
val points to one
defensively tammy lynn baxter
theyre all the same dead weight
cant make a decision cant walk because of their shoes cant work because of their fingernails
make my skin crawl
well im a victim of circumstance
i thought you called it your pecker
look dont make the mistake i made
twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like miss october and whered it get me
here with you
val rolls his eyes give me a break
the pick up rattles toward a tiny utterly isolated high desert hamlet a few dozen houses and mobile homes fighting for shade in the vast landscape
its most prominent feature is an aging wood frame water tower perhaps feet high near the center of town
a sign pans into view perfection pop
val and earl head past the water tower for pham vans general store perfections main gossip stop and only business
the stores sign in english and vietnamese reads groceries haircuts post office town hall val and earl park next to a camouflage painted large tired blazer
just then they spot melvin the towns surly teen aged pain in the ass coming toward them mindlessly bouncing a basketball off the hoods of parked cars
as he nears their truck melvin touch that truck and die
oh man im really shaking
but he steers clear of their truck
inside the energetic vietnamese owner pham van presides over his all purpose establishment part general store part barber shop part saloon
at the bar are burt gummer and his wife heather two no nonsense survivalists who have settled in perfection to await the coming apocalypse a nice enough couple but theres
a hint of paranoia around the edges
burt is shoving a box of cartridges across to pham
no pham theyre not hollow points
i ordered hollow points and thats what i want
when val and earl enter pham automatically pops the tops on two cold beers and has them in place before the cowboys reach the bar
everyone exchanged nods
hi guys what you been up to
ran into the new college student rona
shes getting some kind of strange readings on her things
damn you know those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there
next thing the feds will be at our door
sorry time to move
down honey down
the way you worry youre gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive world war heather and pham laugh
burt smiles patiently
just then the compressor in phams ice cream freezer comes on
its a loud chug chug chug sound mixed with a high pitched squeal
hey val listen
bearing going out you think
he starts toward the compressor but earl heads him off
catch it later pham
gotta get over to nestors
we plan ahead
that way we dont do anything right now
earl explained it to me
as they turn to go val does a take amazed as he spots a decorative bleached out cattle skull displayed on the counter with a
val contd hey pham van what the hell is this
a beauty isnt it
we bought three of them for the rec room
whispers to pham van we sell em to you for three bucks a piece
deadpan and i appreciate it
playfully you dont get it pham
the idea was we were ripping you off
suddenly a car alarm blares from outside
burts out the door in a flash
the others follow
burt races out and shouts at melvin who back guiltily away from burts camouflage blazer
melvin you little pain in the ass
it wasnt me man
your trucks just screwed up thats all
burt angrily switches off the alarm
val and earl laugh as they climb into their truck
why dont his parents ever take him to vegas with them
you gotta ask that at one end of town earl maneuvers a huge bulldozer with a scoop loader blade through a choking cloud of dust scouring out a shallow pit
to serve as a watering hole
val sights down a row of stakes which mark one end of the pit
the job is done
he signals earl to cut the engine
both men have kerchiefs covering their faces and are totally encrusted with dust
nearby is an old battered truck trailer the massive solid steel kind used for heavy rock hauling
tires flat mired in dried mud and weeds it hasnt been used in years
now it provides welcome shade as the men sit sipping some coffee
nestor cunningham drives up surveying the pit with approval
it came out great boys
should fill up just fine come the next rain
lemme have your bill
earl and val start fishing in their pockets for pen and paper
earl comes up with various pieces of paper val with three or four pens
its a moment before they realize each has the other needed implement
earl writes out the bill during nestor contd ill have to send it to you the first of the month boys
val and earl exchange pained looks
nestor contd now you know im good for it
yeah nestor we know
dont worry about it
catch us when you can
they amble over to their truck
earl takes the drivers side and starts fishing in his pockets for the key
val contd are we too easy going
no were not too easy going
this area is economically depressed
val realizes he has the key and hands it over
so what if we just did it
drive straight down to bixby
but wed have to get really serious
its gonna cost twice as much to rent a place
that car wash pays good and theyre always looking
thats got no future
if were gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that
go ahead and plan it
for a year or two
close on a stencilled sign pham vans u rent cesspool septic tanks
pull out to see val and earl have rented a portable septic pump perhaps trailer mounted
the aged machine reeks of and drips with its ignoble cargo
the intake hose has been repaired so often it looks to be more tape than hose
grimacing val threads the slimy hose down through the open top of violas cesspool
beside them is violas well kept mobile home on a low hill not far from pham vans store
well kept flower gardens surround the place
viola a sweet little old lady watches the men work while straining to hold the leash of her tiny but ferocious dog
the dog yaps continuously lunging at val and earl
stop it you horrid animal
to val and earl im going to give her back to my son
i swear it
hey viola youve got my permission
god almighty my mama sure didnt raise me for this
val gets up and starts the pumps gas engine
well youre the one wont work in the car wash
youre the ones gotta have a plan
damn it val
not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this
earl angrily throws the pump valve and starts the pump mechanism
he and val on stand either side of the intake hose as it gurgles happily
what keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet
i was up for going to bixby
i was getting excited
in the past year i mustve said a hundred times we gotta get out of perfection
we gotta better ourselves
you gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think im the reason were still here
you want to know how close i am to going to bixby right now ill call that little bluff
the gurgling intake hose ruptures showering them with well you know
they react as if theyd been shot gagging staggering screaming obscenities
val and earls beat up mobile home is just down the street from pham vans store
val and earl now in cleaner clothes march out resolutely
val has a portable tv in one hand and a framed coors beer sign in the other
earl unhooks the clothes line and dumps it clothes and all into the back of their truck on top of the rest of their belongings
they stare at each other for a moment
this is it
no going back
they leap into the truck
as they drive off val leans out and yanks their wooden nameplate e
mckee off the mailbox
they havent gone fifty yards when they spot nancy sterngood s working in front of her house
the guys pull their hats low over their faces
earl swerves to the far side of the street
uh oh its nancy
she wants another load of firewood
forget it man
its not worth it
nancy spots them and beckons excitedly
shes got us
now listen the plan is we have done our last job in perfection
thats the plan
they stop beside nancy
while they talk nancys daughter mindy comes bouncing along on her pogo stick listening to her walkman and slowly circling the truck
mindy honey dont pogo in the street
hey guys ive got a job for you
we aint doing odd jobs anymore
were headed for bixby permanent
skeptical oh sure
sees stuff in back of truck my god you really are
yep were relocating to an area with a greater economic base
to mindy over her music hey mindy whats the count
six hundred three six hundred four six hundred five
go for it
i made the big decision
im putting in that satellite dish
i was going to offer you five hundred dollars
val and earl glance at each other five hundred dollars
the truck roars toward the leaving perfection sign
val and earl are elated downright giddy
we did it
we faced temptation and we did not bend
now theres nothing between us and bixby but nothing
they zoom past the sign
val contd last time well see that sign
they laugh then are thrown half out of their seats as earl accidentally hits a big pothole
last time we hit that goddamn pothole
as the truck streaks across the landscape
val and earl merrily continue their good byes to whatever is visible
so long cactus
on its way down from the high desert the lonely road now winds through a twisting narrow canyon
a county highway maintenance truck is parked to one side and two road workers carmine and howard repair a slide damaged section of the road carmine breaking up asphalt with
val and earl pull up hand them each a beer and speed away shouting last time down this damn twisty road
the pick up speeds past a small shack
val and earl automatically roll up their windows
in a moment we see why a monster ferocious dog comes galloping out to chase their truck
earl gives the dog the finger
last chance asshole
old fred latches the gate on his corral filled with sheep
he looks up as val and earls truck speeds past
val and earl honk their horn and wave happily
old fred waves back
the pick up zooms along the road now paralleling a line of tall high tension electrical towers
the guys have calmed down but each is still dreaming of a new life
okay heres the plan
we bust our tails in the car wash six months
well maybe nine
and we dont spend a dime you know
and then we go for it
down payment on a tow truck or a back hoe or something right
start a real business
we can start looking for something today tonight
val points up ahead a man is sitting near the top of a distant electrical tower
jeez look at that guy
shakes his head one job id never take is working around electricity
especially when its two hundred feet off the ground
but as the pass the tower val contd hey hold up
thats edgar deems
youre full of shit
hes only got one damn jacket
thats him im telling you
earl pulls over
they climb out and peer up at the tower
edgar is hard to see through the criss crossing girders
impressed man oh man
he mustve really been drunk this time
what the hell you doing
get on down from there
edgar doesnt move
val and earl shift about uncomfortably
well shit we cant leave him up there
they stare at each other
someones got to climb up
val raises his fist in the challenge
their fingers fly
rock breaks scissors
valentine unhappily climbs the tall tower while earl watches from below
val contd hey edgar dont you move
im coming to get you
you damn fool you owe me on this one
higher and higher val climbs
he tries not to look down
hes approaching edgar from below and behind
as he gets nearer he begins to notice forboding details one of edgars shoes is missing half the trouser led is torn off
edgar is strapped to a girder by his belt his shotgun gripped in his hands
a swarm of flies buzzes away
val contd what the hell
he edges around to where he can see edgars face the eyes are wide open staring
old fred is now hoeing his garden
he glances up as val and earls pick up roars back toward perfection
a big station wagon is parked between a small mobile home and a half finished house being built by jim and megan wallace an out going energetic older couple
lumber cinder blocks and tools are scattered around the yard
jim examines edgars body in the bed of val and earls pick up truck
val earl and megan talk in subdued tones
real sorry to bother you megan but we figured since jims a doctor
no its fine
you did the right thing
when jim is done well call the coroners office in bixby
well take care of it
shakes her head poor edgar
tries to break the mood well i see you got all the wallboard up
that was easy
you two did the hard part
sure sorry youre leaving
jim climbs out of the pick up
was is a heart attack
shaking his head he died of dehydration
but that doesnt make sense
that takes a couple of days doesnt it
three or four even
you mean he sat up there three or four days just sat there till he died of thirst
everyone is mystified
fred is still hoeing
in the nearby pen his sheep start acting restless
he eyes them
we hear a strange muffled sound
unseen behind him at the far end of the garden his scarecrow mysteriously tilts
old fred keeps hoeing
he stops his foot is caught in the dirt
suddenly he is yanked knee deep into the ground
val and earls truck again headed for bixby and going way too fast zooms past the two workers still repairing the road
the workers glance up annoyed
val and earl sobered and deep in thought drive past the shack where the ferocious dog lives
they automatically roll up their windows during reckon he hated perfection more than us
you suppose he wanted to kill himself
if he did why didnt he use his damn shotgun
maybe he just couldnt pull the trigger
oh sure he figured it was easier to die of thirst
come on sombody mustve chased him up there
oh you mean somebody who aint scared of a twelve gauge shotgun
and then what did they do
camp out down below and just wait for him to die
val has no answer
its too weird
well whatever the hell happened its just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place
you got that right
they are passing the shack
earl suddenly realizes earl contd hey where the hells that asshole dog
looking around probably up a pole starving itself to death
okay the plan is pedal to the metal the whole way
we dont stop till we hit the carwash not even to pee
ill go with that plan
close on the pick ups tires skidding to a stop
pull out to see were back at old freds
what are you doing
earl is staring wide eyed
val follows earls gaze and is aghast when he sees the sheep pen its a ghastly bloody mess
scattered on the churned up ground a few dismembered sheep legs and heads are all that remain of the flock
whispers what the hell
val and earl leap out of the truck to investigate
hey old fred
where are you
earl dashes into freds house
val checks around outside
earl comes back out
then they spot something lying in the middle of the garden old freds hat
still looking all around val squats distractedly to pick up the hat
he and earl stumble backward in shock
old fred is still wearing his hat
his mangled face stares up at them eyes and mouth frozen open in a death grimace
what the hell is going on
i mean carmine and howard continue repairing the road carmine still using the noisy jackhammer
val and earl drive up
you guys better get the hell outta here
we got a killer on the loose
carmine stops jackhammering to listen
a real psycho
hes cutting peoples heads off
id high tail for town if i was you
val and earl speed away
but he edges over to the truck and takes out a heavy steel pry bar to keep within easy reach
carmine goes back to work pounding the asphalt with the jackhammer
suddenly the blade strikes something beneath the road something soft
we hear a strange unearthly shriek from underground
a weird orange goo gushes up around the blade
then the jackhammer takes off by itself like a harpoon stuck in a whale
carmine gets tangled in the jack hammers air hose and is dragged along shouting for help
howard chases him down the embankment and into the scrub brush
he hears carmine screaming
what the hell is it
where are you
but now there is only silence
howard crashes through the brush
all he finds is the torn end of the air hose which suddenly sucks down into the ground
hes momentarily staggered by an awful smell but forces himself to keep looking
he lets the pry bar drag on the ground
then something it looks like a mouth or a horrid beak shoots out of the ground and grips the pry bar with uncanny strength
howard drops his weapon and scrambles madly away
he clambers back onto the road
but almost immediately cracks form in the pavement around him
more beak things break through the asphalt between him and his truck
he dashes across the road scrambling up the embankment
he clings precariously to a tree root looking down whered they go
suddenly the dirt around him begins to bubble
several hungry beaks break through and grab him yanking him head first into the embankment
then the embankment gives way crashing down onto the road taking with it a nearby telephone pole and snapping the lines
pham van is talking to miguel a local rancher
they both jump as the doors burst open
val and earl race in trailed by nestor and melvin
val heads for the payphone during his head
you mean just his head
val grabs the phone and digs in his pocket for change
yeah really sick man
sweet old fred
earl comes up with change and hands it to val who dials
something happen to fred
ignoring pham are you serious man
they killed him just to take his sheep he didnt have nothing else to steal
neither did edgar
what happened to edgar
val stares at the phone
i dont believe this
the phone is out
pham your phone is out
i didnt do it
whats going on
val and earl rush out
trailed by the others val and earl march out and leap into their truck val driving now
he searches for the key
weve gotta get the police up here
you guys gotta step on it to bixby
earl hands val the key
consider it stepped on
again the pick up barrels through the canyon
brother we decided to leave this place just one day too late you know
grimly well theres sure as hell nothing to stop us now
everybody we know between here and bixby is already dead
earl points ahead and screams val brings the truck to a squealing stop
ahead the collapsed embankment completely blocks the road
its totally impassable
the cowboys are dumbfounded
is some higher force at work here
are we asking too much of life
but val is in no mood for philosophy
he leaps out and peers into the highway maintenance truck which sits undisturbed emergency lights still flashing
theres nobody in it
he starts looking around
those assholes are supposed to be fixing the goddamn road
where are you guys
people gotta use this road you know
you on a booze break or what
whispers urgently pointing val
val looks where hes pointing howards bloodstained hardhat lies at the edge of the landslide
val gets the point
looking around for the unknown assailant he eases back into the truck
earl already has a pistol in his lap and is digging through the glove compartment
earl contd where are the bullets
dont we have any goddamn bullets
val quickly jockeys the truck to turn it around on the narrow road
but as he backs into the hillside we hear a strange grating clunk from underneath
when he tries to pull forward the truck wont move
the engine stalls
i dont believe this
youre hung up again
i am not
they both lean out
the rear tires are clear
val restarts the truck and tries to pull forward rocking the truck against some unseen pull
smoke wells up from the clutch
youre hung up i tell you
youre gonna burn the clutch
val slams the truck into low range four wheel drive and revs it
the tires dig in fighting for traction and suddenly the truck lurches free
we hear an eerie shriek mingled with gear and engine noise as val angrily roars away
earl contd jesus you can break an axle like that
hey i dont want spend the night out here
the word has spread
everybody in town is gathered at pham vans
they rush out to meet val and earl as they drive up
what the hell you doing back already
youre never going to believe this but the canyon road
we were on it not two hours ago
well its completely
but he stops because theyre all staring wide eyed at the rear of the truck
val and earl jump out and look where everyone else is looking
their jaws drop
reveal hanging from the rear axle of their truck and trailing out behind like a nightmare wedding decoration a sex foot long grotesque fleshy tentacle
the end gripping the axle looks like a vicious razor sharp beak or hook
the trailing end is mutilated oozing orange goo as though the creature was torn in half
whered you get it
didnt know we had it
eels live in water
its some kind of snake
or a big mother slug maybe
some kind of mutation
burt more daring than the others pries the thing off the axle with a shovel
dont touch dont touch
its dead all right
tore the damn thing in half
it mustve grabbed us
thats why the truck stalled out
suddenly indignant yeah
next time i tell you im not hung up
stalled out your truck
have to be one strong son of a bitch
pham van leaps over them
i give you boys five dollars for it
val and earl square their shoulders
this time theyre ready for him
okay ten dollars
damn right fifteen
burt is deep in thought
just one of these couldnt eat up off a whole flock of sheep
theres gotta be more out there a lot more
a cold chill spreads through the group
they stare out at the vast forbidding desert
they suddenly feel alone very alone
close on rhondas hat lying on the ground
we think the worst
then she reaches in picks it up and puts it on
reveal shes in a lonely corner of the valley working with a seismograph
she pounds a marking stake into the dirt
the needle responds to each blow on the stake
we hear rhonda stop pounding
the needle stops
all is silent but the needle starts moving again low camera is moving in rhondas general direction
she starts to pound another stake
camera reacts so it is moving straight toward her
as it passes a burrow a rabbit suddenly scouts out
camera whip pans to watch the rabbit scamper into the distance then turns back to move toward rhonda who still pounding her stake
camera passes rhondas seismograph
the machine tilts slightly as the ground bulges up beneath it
rhonda finishes pounding
she heads for her truck noisily tossing in her tools and slamming the tailgate
camera closes in on her faster and faster
it is right on her heels as she climbs into the cab
a beak thing thrusts out of the ground groping where rhondas boot just was
rhonda drives off unknowingly running right over the thing
we hear a shriek of pain as the tentacle writhes and sucks back under the ground
mindy sterngood poses cautiously with the bizarre hook tentacle
a camera flashes and we reveal pham van taking her photo beside a sign photographs you and the snake monster
viola and miguel wait in line
we now see the store is crowded with concerned townsfolk debating what to do and how to protect themselves
val and earl sit on the sidelines sipping beer gazing in awe at enterprising phan vam slick as snot and im not lying
fifteen lousy bucks
a man who plans ahead
dominating the discussion are burt and heather now armed with scoped magnum hunting rifles
heather stands guard at a window peering out into the night
to group look we organize we arm ourselves
we go out we find those damn snake things we make em extinct
come on burt we dont even know what they are
might be aliens
why go looking for trouble
miguel the troubles come to us
if were not ready
were on our own
sarcastic and you two just love it dont you
come on nancy dont lets get personal
we need to do something
burt steps over to a faded topographic map on the wall and points out details during damn right
you folks gotta analyze the situation
with that road out were completely cut off
got the cliffs to the north mountains east and west
thats why heather and me settled here in the first place geographic isolation
there must be dome way to get help
yes thats what i say
how for chrissake
you gonna walk thirty eight miles to bixby
hey what about pham vans saddle horses
all heads turn toward pham van
youre welcome to them
does anybody know how to ride
all heads turn toward val and earl
in the vast desert night a single floodlight illuminates jim and megans partially finished house
their station wagon is parked out front
a country and western tune drifts to us from its radio
as we move closer we see the floodlight is powered by a small softly purring generator set maybe fifty feet away
jim and megan both exhausted unload a big stack of roofing shingles from their station wagon
jim starts to lift a package of shingles but gives up and sits on the tailgate
lets finish in the morning
we have to go into bixby in the morning
grins devilishly the concrete blocks are in
oh my god
just keep looking at that beautiful sky
thats the sky thats going to be over our roof every night when were done
joking ah but consider this if we dont finish the roof we can looks at that sky all the time
just then the whirring of the generator becomes strangely muffled
the floodlight flickers
now the generator dies
darkness engulfs them
the car radio music drones on incongruously
jim contd damn that thing
sarcastic we could always buy a new generator
jim digs out a powerful flashlight and heads over toward the generator
megan lies back taking a welcome breather
after a moment well whats wrong with it
baffled he sweeps the whole area with the flashlight
megan joins him
you sure this is where it was
am i sure
points with flashlight it was right there
theres the cord
the severed electric cable stops at the edge of a cone shaped depression in the dirt where the generator sat
he hands her the flashlight and kneels
we watch tensely as he probes the loose earth with his hands
jim contd maybe the ground caved in
theres a lot of old mines and stuff around here
megan grabs his shirt trying to pull him back
well dont then
you dont want to fall in
suddenly about ten feet away whoomp
the generator shoots up out of the ground
jim and megan dive for cover as it sails through the air and crashes to earth
they stare transfixed
the generator is dented and bent almost beyond recognition and covered with oozing slime
but megan is all action
she yanks him back
get away from it
god what a stink
we again hear that mysterious rumbling sound
jim stops sweeping the flashlight around them
jim contd hear that
never mind lets go
lets just go into town or something
jim please she hustles him bodily toward the car during you know i bet its geological or something like natural gas or a geyser
they stink like that
remember in yellowstone
suddenly he drops knee deep into ground
megan is thrown off balance and tumbles to one side
the flashlight falls lighting them at an eerie low angle
jim contd somethings got me
we hear sickening crunches from below the earth
he screams in excruciating agony
jim contd oh god
get me out
get me out
he struggles wildly but just sinks further down
megan slides a x over to jim
he grabs it like a drowning man trying to keep himself from being pulled down
but hes pulled with suck power the x snaps
his head is going under
megan desperately tries to dig the smothering earth away but shes losing
now only his arms are above ground
she pulls with all her might but he sinks inexorably down down
shes pulled flat on the ground
the next instant a vicious hook tentacle erupts through the earth missing megans face by inches
she scrambles back frantically
low camera pursues megan toward the car just missing her as she dives in through the open tailgate
she slams it after her
the talons rake across the car scratching the glass
megan tumbles into the front seat
thank god the keys are in the ignition
she starts the engine
but outside the snake things attack the car in a frenzy slashing blindly
a rear tire is totally shredded just as megan floors it
the car lurches forward but the mutilated tire falls apart
the wheel rim digs into the loose earth and the car is stuck
with no other recourse megan locks the door rolls up the windows and cowers in the middle of the car panting sobbing
the radio is still playing a happy cowboy tune
she peeks out
they gave up
nothing happens for a moment then the car starts to shake and shudder
dust wells up around the windows
outside we see a bizarre sight
the earth around the rear of the car is boiling dirt flying in all directions and the car starts to sink into the ground megan wildly honks the horn
the car looks just like a ship going down by the stern hood tilting up gracefully
the back windows shatter dirt pouring in
megan smashes the windshield with a small fire extinguisher and scrambles out on the hood
but theres no hope
the car keeps sinking titling now almost ninety degrees forcing her onto a precarious perch on the grille sinking sinking
out of her mind with terror she keeps softly murmuring the same hopeless phrases stop it
somebody stop it
the headlights are two ironic beacons sending their beams skyward through the roiling dust into the night sky
the sound of the radio becomes muffled
the headlights sink from view and then megans scream floats across the desert
out front of pham vans nervous val and earl saddle up the horses while pham loads their saddle bags with food
every one has gathered to see them off
theres an air of tension
eyeing the horses pham we dont want to be stuck on a couple of canners
they better be fast
a snake thing like that couldnt move too quick
for all you know they could fly earl pulls their old smith and wesson revolver and battered winchester rifle out of the pick up truck
you want the rifle or the smith
definite the rifle
so does earl
he raises his hand
they swiftly do a round of scissors rock paper
he hands val the rifle
just then burt and heather pull up in their blazer climbing out with their hunting rifles
you guys all set
ready as well ever be
heather and i are going to drive around a little see if we can find that college girl and tell her to get her ass back into town
and well swing by the doctors place
they were going to go into bixby but we dont know if they left before the road was out
val and earl mount up
you guys oughta take something that packs more punch than that thirty thirty
take one of our browning autos or even my model seventy
offers her hunting rifle its three seventy five h and h mag
earl takes the awesome looking gun with a smug glance at val
hope we dont need it
heather unhooks a box of cartridges from her belt and hands it to earl
suddenly theres a blood curdling scream
the door to pham vans flies open
out staggers melvin wrapped in pham vans hook tentacle writhing in apparent agony
its got me
its got me
people scatter like sheep
burt and heather have guns trained on him in an instant
then everyone realizes its a sick joke
melvin collapses with laughter
burt is livid
he almost shot melvin
he charges over and yanks the kid to his feet screaming you stupid punk
you came that close that close
one of these days melvin somebodys gonna kick your ass
pham rushes over and grabs his precious tentacle
as people calm down val and earl gaze nervously at the vast desert before them
you fellas watch yourselves
come back with the sheriff
sheriff like hell
come back with the national guard
they ride out to an adlib chorus keep your heads down go careful boys keep a sharp lookout etc
val and earl ride along very tiny in the vast lonely landscape and very on edge
constantly looking all around
you know we cant possibly make bixby by nightfall
val doesnt want to hear it
that means were gonna be out here like in the dark
faint country and western radio music drifts to them
theyre nearing jim and megans house
val knocks on the door to the mobile home
hey doctor anybody here
he opens the door and peers inside
behind him earl steps out of the half finished house and shrugs
wind rustles the plastic sheeting over the windows
strangely they can still hear the muffled radio clearly
spooked oh man i hate this shit
they walk briskly to their horses
earl snatches heathers rifle from its saddle scabbard
val pulls out the winchester
earl tries to reassure himself
we just missed them thats all
then wheres the goddamn conway twitty coming from
they focus on the sound and walk gingerly toward it keeping constant watch in every direction
the ground here is all torn up like the sheep pen and the music is coming from underneath what the hell is going on
val scrapes at the dirt with his boot and finds the headlight of jim and megans station wagon still on glaring up at him
he drops down and wildly sweeps away more dirt revealing more of the cars grille and hood and blood soaked dirt which sticks to his hand
he leaps away frantically rubbing the blood off on his pants
val contd oh man
val and earl are riding at full gallop
they race alongside a concrete lined flood control ditch and veer off to follow a barbed wire fence which crosses the ditch
they ride along the fence during heres the plan
we dont even stop
ride like hell
tonight we keep right on going
well walk the horses
that is the plan
i mean goddamn it
what the hell are those things
how could they bury an entire plymouth station wagon
why would they do it
suddenly the horses stop short
in a frenzy they wheel around rear up refusing to go on
the cowboys fight to control them
i knew it
pham van wouldnt know a decent horse if
but earls already drawing his rifle
they got wind of something they dont like
he draws his rifle
they look wildly in all directions at once but theres nothing only empty desert
val contd but i dont see anything
they keep staring
the horses keep pacing nervously
then earls horse rears wildly and falls
earl goes flying
val wheels around wildly dismounts and runs to earl whos bruised and winded but basically unhurt
they think earls horse just tripped
val contd hey you okay
turning to the horse what about the hor
their eyes bulge
several snake things have engulfed the horses head sucking crushing slurping
vals horse goes berserk and gallops for the horizon
earl contd what in the name
thats how they get you
theyre under the goddamn ground suddenly they realize what that means the thing could come up under them the cowboys scramble frantically away
but nothing pursues them
they pause glancing back nervously
what the hell are they
sons of bitches
val raises his rifle and takes a well aimed shot hitting one of them
orange goo spurts out
we hear a deafening shriek as all the snake things instantly zip back underground
then a huge mound of earth rises up under val and earl
the cowboys tumble down its side val losing his rifle
they roll over and stare dumbfounded at the mound
val contd gasps there must be a million of them
the mound of earth turns toward them
the ground splits open and out rises a huge head
the monster is a horrendous thirty foot long eating machine
its head is eyeless utterly alien covered with tough boney plates which close together to form a cork screw point
the cowboys stumble back toward the fence in speechless terror
the creature slides toward them pushing through the earth like a whale through water
now it opens its mouth but its like a grotesque flower boney plates spreading open like petals revealing a huge slimy fleshy oozing orifice
and inside the mouth a ghastly multi tentacled tongue
these are the snake things not snakes at all but actually the horrid hook tentacles that can shoot out six feet to snag their prey
the monster snorts and snuffs throwing up plumes of dust sounding like a horrendous pig
it sinks into the earth and charges
we see the hump of earth move toward them faster and faster but then it disappears as the creature goes deeper
val and earl leap sideways and run along the fence
the creature goes straight and slams into a fencepost from below
all we see is the fencepost knocked at a crazy angle
the cowboys keep running
the creature regroups and charges after them hitting each fencepost in turn sending weird sinuous shock waves along the barbed wire making almost musical twanging sounds
val looks back
its gaining on us
and as if that werent enough earl points to more trouble ahead
the fence runs straight to the edge of the ditch an eight foot wide gap yawning dead ahead
the creature churns like a locomotive from behind
theyll have to try to jump
they strain desperately for every last fraction of speed
we can do it we can do it
they leap and they dont do it
they smack into the opposite side of the ditch clawing frantically at the lip only to tumble to its sloping bottom
a split second later the charging creature slams like a wrecking ball into the foot thick concrete wall
the wall cracks and bulges out
a hook tentacle flops out through one of the cracks
terrified val and earl scramble away
but the wall holds together
and the strangely all is quiet
the tentacle lays dead still
eventually the cowering cowboys dare to creep back a little closer still panting exhausted jumpy
stupid son of a bitch
knocked itself cold
and now orange slime begins to ooze through the cracks in the concrete
cold my ass
we killed the bastard
he suddenly shakes his fist at the dead beast
val contd you fucker
they allow themselves a small wheeze of nervous laughter only to jump like rabbits as some pebbles rattle loudly down the concrete wall behind them
they whirl to see rhonda up on the opposite side of the ditch staring down at them
shes lugging a bunch of her equipment including a small folding shovel
hi guys howre you doing
look can i ask you something
did you just notice something weird
you know some kind of earth tremor
val and earl look at each other then burst out laughing
rhonda spots the cracked wall
rhonda contd whats that
the shattered concrete has been pulled away to fully reveal the creatures horrendous head
start close on it oozing blood slavering mouth plates hanging open hook tentacles lolling out
widen to see earl and rhonda sweating dusty and tired staring in awe and cringing at the stench
think it smells like that cause its dead
i dont see any eyes
must be totally subterranean
and those tentacles
i think they shoot right outta its mouth hook you and pull you right in
good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else
shudders yeah im lucky it didnt find me overwhelmed this is important you know
this is like well lets say it its probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century
history we can hear a shovel digging up above and now val shouts i got it
heres the other end
just look at what we caught here
earl and rhonda climb up
crane up with them to reveal the whole animal
val digging excitedly with rhondas shovel is just scraping away the last loose dirt from the creatures tail
the whole length of the immense thirty foot beast is partially uncovered in king sized bas relief
hushed this is one big mother
so this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime
she nods stepping down to study the creature
the body is stream lined cigar shaped maybe eight feet in diameter at its thickest
its covered with hundreds of short rear pointing retractable spikes
rhonda gingerly jiggles one
it can be pushed in and out of its socket like a plunger
rhonda contd it must push itself along with these
hundreds of them pushing at once
thats how it can move so fast
i mean this thing was tripping sensors all over the valley
no wonder i couldnt
a chilling thought stops her in mid sentence
she springs down into the drainage ditch to get her backpack pulling out her seismograph printouts
she studies them frantically during hey rhonda you ever heard of any thing like this before
elbows earl sure earl everybody knows about them
we just didnt tell you come on nobodys ever seen one of these
were really in on something here
the guys looks at each other
one thought immediately springs to their minds
pham van dont get his mitts on this for no measly fifteen bucks
you got that right
while they bask in their fame to be rhonda continues to study the print outs coming to a terrifying conclusion
heres the plan well get a
a flatbed i guess with a big winch figure a five ton anyway
naw dont want to winch it
thatd tear it all up
want to lift it
some kind of crane with lifting straps
but rhonda interrupts now really scared
hey hey shut up
the way i figure it
there are five more of these things
val and earl shut right up
earl edges up a fencepost
val sidles up onto a rock during five more
rhonda paws through her unwieldy printouts pointing out jagged ink lines on the graphs comparing different ones
yeah darn it look
ive got seismographs all over the valley
if you compare the different readings there have to be five
heres one at two oclock yesterday but heres another one three miles away at the same time
so thats two
the men leap from their perches and hustle her in the direction she came from
well take your word for it
wheres your truck
the other side of that dome
she indicates what to most of us would be a hill dotted with huge boulders thrusting out of the sandy desert soil like big mushrooms
the trio jogs toward the hill
en route to the truck they pass near one of rhondas seismographs
suddenly earl stumbles as one leg drops knee deep into the ground
val wheels and bodily yanks him up
they back away from the small hole in the ground calming a little as they realize prairie dog burrow
little sons of bitches
rhonda tenses as she hears a sound she knows well the soft scratching of the seismograph needle across its paper cylinder
she whacks val on the shoulder and points speechlessly at it
the needle is going wild
she doesnt have to explain
all three of them dash dash for the remains of an old rail fence lay beside one of the boulders
val earl and rhonda scramble over the wood up onto the rock and stand there tensely
in a moment the creature gently rustles the earth at the base of the rock
the monsters slimy hook tentacles slither out searching the rock base
shuddering the humans move as high as they can well out of reach
the tentacles slip back beneath the earth
everyone breathes a sigh of relief
well at least the bastard cant climb
pardon my french
probably couldnt move too easily on the surface
god the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones
okay now how fars your truck
they can see the roof of her truck maybe a hundred yards away through the boulders
val and earl think about it
i dont know
if this ones any faster than that other one
nods i think we wait right here
its hours later
stiff and uncomfortable they have nothing to do but theorize
theres nothing like them in the fossil record im sure
okay so they predate the fossil record
not buying it herself thatd make them a couple of billion years old
and weve just never seen one till now
id vote for outer space
no way those are local boys
joking atomic testing
or no bio engineering
the government built them a big surprise in the next war
theres a long pause
earl stares at the dirt around the rock
havent seen a sign for hours
maybe its long gone
maybe it is
why dont you take a little stroll and see
fuck you too
pardon my french
well weve got to do something val gets an idea
he grabs a post from the dilapidated fence and cautiously slips down near the boulders edge
its got a good six foot reach
dead silence as he reaches way out with the post and scrapes it on the ground
almost instantly the creature roars up grabbing the post in a flurry of flying dirt and lashing tentacles nearly hooking vals hand
val practically falls over himself scrambling back to safety
son of a bitch
son of a god damned bitch
been waiting there all this time
how the hells it even know were still here
its been listening to us
its got no eyes
it sure as hell cant smell anything underground so i figure
rhonda stares at val impressed
it can sense the slightest seismic vibration
hear every move we make
especially on this rock
its a perfect conductor
they all settle back having no idea what to do next
rhonda gazes out at the desert that surrounds them like an ocean
rhonda contd i always wanted to be stuck on a desert island
but somehow i always imagined you know water
our heroes are silhouetted against a huge spectacular desert night sky
after a very long pause you know i hate to be crude but im gonna have to take care of some business here
emphatic me too
just as emphatic same here
the silhouettes shift val and earl moving down one side of the rock and rhonda down the other
we can no longer see them
we just head zippers zipping down then soft sighs of relief from val and earl
then softly darn it
but ill tell you if you ever wanted proof god is a man this is it
rich orange sunlight creeps silently across the deathly still desert
earl is already awake
val is curled up without his jacket shivering
he wakes with a start
where the hells his jacket
rhonda wakes slowly
shes surprised to find herself wrapped in vals jacket
touched by his chivalry she embarrassedly hands it to baffled val
val glances at earl who looks away
to rhonda no problem
earl gropes through his pockets coming up with only cigarettes
val fishes in his own pockets finding only their lighter
they exchange items and light up during well folks whats the plan
first lets see if stumpys still out there
this time he tosses a piece of wood out onto the sand
with soft rustling a bulge forms in the earth moves over to the wood then subsides
rhonda starts looking around during dont he have a home to go to
grim well thats why edgar never got down off that tower
i might have an idea
ignoring her were gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or its just gonna wait us to death
well i was wondering if we could
well lets just run for it
we outran that one yesterday at least on a sprint
rhonda gives up on them
she goes over and pulls a long cross rail from the fence during run for it
runnings not a plan
running is what you do when the plan fails
youre not even trying to come up with a plan
well its not like weve got a hell of a lot of options
interrupting you guys know how to pole vault
they watch in surprise as she hefts her pole checks the balance eyeballs the distance to the nearest boulder
then she charges between them plants her pole and vaults smoothly over to the next boulder maybe fifteen feet away
the creature surfaces where her pole touched down but too late a hook tentacle vainly sweeps the area the disappears into the ground
val and earl glance at each other impressed rhonda contd we just stay where it cant get us
on these residual boulders
my trucks parked right next to one
earl rushes to grab a couple more fence rails
stay on those residual boulders
val just stands staring across at rhonda his horizons are broadening
earl stuffs a fence rail into his hands
earl contd pointedly tammy lynn baxter she do a lot of pole vaulting
earl takes a deep breath and goes for it vaulting across to rhonda
through the shimmering heat in the distance we see the strange sight of the three figures vaulting from boulder to boulder
val earl and rhonda pole vault their way toward the truck
finally theyre at the nearest boulder but the truck is still ten feet away
think its still following us
lets assume that it is
and once we hit that truck we gotta go fast
i say we all jump together
rhonda and val nod
rhonda grips her car keys in her teeth
through clenched teeth ready
one two three
they all vault in unison landing in the truck bed
rhonda scrambles up slides open the cabs rear window and begins wriggling through headfirst
whispers come on girl it aint gonna give us much time
dust explodes around the rear of the truck
hook tentacles snake up on all sides narrowly missing val
he and earl grab whatevers handy pounding at the tentacles with expensive instruments
rhondas only half way through the cab window still hanging headfirst into the cab
she frantically starts the truck dives down and punches the accelerator with her fist
as the truck roars away one tentacles manages to tear off the the muffler
the engine thunders like a tank
val and earl sit back sighing in relief then react when they see rhonda is driving upside down and blind
rhonda skids her noisy truck to a halt in front of pham vans
we better get everybody together
val leaps out and jumps into his pick up truck
he searches for the key
you go north ill go south
val holds out his hand for the key
earl tosses it to him
val drives off
we follow rhonda and earl as they drive the other way toward violas
ill bet youre sorry the college ever sent you up here
well im scared but im not sorry
you know val went to that college too
for a whole year
couldnt quite sit still for it though
had too much vinegar in his system
but once he settles down forgets this cowboy stuff hell be one in a million
rhonda sees straight through earls clumsy attempt at match making
she cant help but smile
earl grins sheepishly
earl contd all right im about as subtle as a donkeys ass
pardon my french
im just saying the boys got potential thats all
move in on rhonda her and val
nestor viola nancy and miguel nervously crowd around val earl and rhonda
viola holds her yappy dog which perio dically snarls and snaps at people
pham van is on his cb radio trying to contact burt and heather
you serious val
you think were not even safe here in town
ask me that after you meet one
i think we should all get the hell out while the gettings good
why not just take a number ten pick axe and give it one good whack
nestor damn it these things are bigger than an airstream trailer
god ive got to find mindy
nancy rushes out
hey pham wheres burt and heather
hangs up cb cant raise them
i guess theyre still out there somewhere
if youve got a radio why arent you calling somebody in bixby
the police or
cant reach outside the valley
you know because of the mountains
hey rhonda whats the name you call those things huh
whered they come from
i dont know
youre a scientist right
you should have a theory at least
look these things are absolutely unprecedented
yeah but whered they come from
exasperated whered they come from
okay worms probably in the jurassic period
cosmic radiation was much higher then
so they mutated
and they got so big they just sank right into the ground and fell asleep
but now continental drift has brought them to the surface ready to be harvested by the ancient alien meat growers who planted them here
everybody stares at her then they smile realizing shes pulling their legs
youre right dont matter where they come from
we need to be talking about what were gonna do
my goodness valentine once they see the road is out and the phone lines are down someone will be along to look in on us
dont you think
we see the utility truck still parked near the landslide blocking the road
reveal on the far side a telephone maintenance truck is now parked emergency lights flashing and nearby amid phoneworkers climbing and repair gear two more hard hats lying on blood
the crowd is still jabbering away
rhonda speak over them no no no they listen they can sense the slightest vibration through the ground
thats how they see
thats how they hunt so like we dont vibrate right
maybe they wont even come to here huh
maybe they leave us alone
val shakes his head and marches over to the topographic map on the wall
they caught up with edgar here
they grabbed old fred here
they nailed the asshole dog here
and the doctors place is here
the spots he indicates describe a line leading along the valley straight toward town
val contd this valleys just one long smorgasbord and if we dont haul ass outta here were the next course
we hear an a eerie shriek from outside
something shoots in through the window striking earl in the chest
earl flails frantically at it but its only melvins basketball
we glimpse melvin outside doubled over with laughter
earl grabs the ball and hurls it viciously back but melvin easily dodges it
you little ass wipe
you knock that off or youre gonna be shitting that basketball
pardon my french
to val now val lets assume theyre as dangerous as you say
where are we going to go thats safer than right here
rhondas got an idea about that
yes see they move very easily through the pleistocene alluvials
off their blank looks the dirt
the loose soil that makes up the valley floor
but they cant move through solid rock
i think we should travel west to the mountains
you know up the jeep trail
the mountains are solid granite
wed be safe there and we could hike along them
all the way to bixby if we have to
nancy rushes back toward pham vans still looking
were close on melvin as he circles around the back of pham vans bouncing his basketball mischief in his eyes
we can hear the townsfolk inside
no valentine im not leaving my place
well its gonna take us days to get back with help
doggone it viola its just plain crazy to stay
then to melvins astonishment the steady rhythm of his bouncing basketball suddenly stops
the ball just goes flup and doesnt bounce back up to him
he looks down
just swirling dust at his feet
everyone jumps as we once more hear an ear shattering shriek from melvin
earl snarls and heads for the door val right behind them
im gonna kick his ass
im gonna help you
val and earl are well ahead of the other townsfolk as they march around to the side of pham vans
but wheres melvin
nothing out here but the oppressive hot desert silence
then they hear a soft shuddering whimper from above
theres terrified melvin halfway up a telephone pole clinging to it desperately
val and earl freeze in their tracks and glance at each other realizing instantly whats up
without a word they leap desperately in opposite directions
like a breaching whale a creature roars up through the earth right where they were standing great mouth gaping open slimy tentacles lashing in all directions
the townsfolk scatter some heading for their homes including viola and nestor
others scramble over each other as they pile back into pham vans
the telephone pole shudders
melvin falls and scampers for the nearest hiding place a corrugated tin storage shed near pham vans
val earl rhonda miguel and pham van rush in
man you gut a gun
big as a house
what are we gonna do
miguel and pham shut up
then we hear something new the building itself creaking and groaning like a ship
the liquor bottles behind pham vans bar vibrate and clink
the creature is moving beneath the building
the people freeze like mannequins
now we can hear its pig like snorting
pham van and miguel react as the awful smell percolates up through the floorboards
val signals them to keep quiet
finally the creaking stops
rhonda addresses the group in an intense whisper remember
everyone stands stock still and sweats
but then slowly we become aware of a faint yet oddly familiar sound
squeak squeak squeak mindy on her pogo stick
they all scramble to the windows
there she is alone in the vacant street walkman blaring in her ears merrily bouncing along to a rock n roll beat
thoughts of personal safety vanish as the horrified people lean way out the doors and windows and shout with one voice ad lib get off your pogo stick
get in here girl
she cant hear them over her walkman
a tell tale puff of dust spurts up not fifty feet from her
val sees mindy has only seconds left
he vaults straight out the window and charges toward her
right behind him comes earl and rhonda
as she rounds a corner at the opposite end of town
she spots mindy then sees val running
she starts running
shes lazily bouncing in circles squeak squeak squeak
she goes wide eyed as she rotates to see val coming at her like a mad bull arms outstretched
the asphalt under her pogo stick cracks and val tackles her both of them tumbling head over heels
she scrambles up rubbing her skinned elbow and yelling oww
val you hurt me
val claps his hand over her mouth
she goes wide eyed as she sees her pogo stick standing straight up in the cracked asphalt
then it is sucked down like so much spaghetti
nancy rushes into frame hugging mindy
val signals her to be quiet
they sit uneasily
wheres the creature
suddenly the pogo stick erupts out of the earth right in their midst
val runs one way nancy and mindy the other heading up the street toward their house
val scrambles up onto his pick up truck
the creature rams the truck rupturing a tire
as it shakes the truck violently val spots rhonda and earl now standing uncertainly halfway between him and pham vans
go back for chrissake
rhonda and earl hesitate
we gotta get him off there
itll suck that truck down
but earl now hears something behind them
down the street a little wall of cinder blocks framing violas driveway suddenly topples over
rhonda another one
camera charges toward them
earl swerves toward pham vans but rhonda is cut off
she heads toward the next nearest haven the storage shed where melvin is hiding
it sits in a vacant weed choked lot
crashing through the weeds rhonda has almost reached the shed when she is suddenly brought up short and slams face down in a cloud of dust
she cant get up
somethings got her
shes caught in an old rusted barbed wire fence lying almost flat hidden in the weeds
some strands have come loose and are curled up like vicious concertina wire
barely has she taken this in when the ground caves in under her
she rolls wildly to one side as hook tentacles snake up missing her by inches
she keeps rolling crawling scrambling anything to get away from the awful maw but gets her legs hopelessly tangled in the barbed wire
the creature feels around where she was
she calms herself pulling gingerly at the wire working tensely to free herself but the creatures mouth slams shut on the fence
like a spider sensing something caught in its web the monster knows its on to something
its hook tentacles shoot forward to snare three feet of fence then the creature lunges up and out swallowing that three feet in a big gulp and yanking rhonda violently
she screams pants ripped legs slashed and bleeding
shes dragged even closer
the truck shakes and shimmies as vals creature tries to pull it down
val sees that rhondas in trouble
he searches frantically for a weapon and finds one a chain saw
he leaps as far from the truck as he can and hits the ground running yanking furiously on the saws starter cord
rhonda is in a dead panic thrashing helplessly in the barbed wire
the beast takes another gulp of fence wrenching her within inches of a probing hook tentacle
suddenly we hear a nasty roar as vals chain saw swings in slicing the squirm ing tentacle in half spraying gore everywhere
the creature unleashes an unearthly shriek and the other tentacles recoil
the severed one writhes like a beheaded snake
val yanks off rhondas boots
outta your pants
she frantically claws at her belt
but in mere seconds pointing tentacles snake out to regain their grip on the fence
val grabs the saw and starts slashing wildly but this time the hook tentacles snag it and wrench it from his grasp
it slams to the ground motor dying
the monster readies itself for the lunge that will suck rhonda in
val grabs her under the arms and pulls
rhonda wriggles wildly to get out of her wire enmeshed pants
the creature lunges
rhonda pulls free
she and val tumble backward
the creature gets only a mouthful of rhondas jeans
the next instant the second creature explodes up through the ground right next to fallen val and rhonda
they roll sideways come up running and sprint for pham vans along an old wooden sidewalk
earl flings open the front door
val and rhonda race toward the porch
right on their heels the creature ripples the boards like an ocean wave
dont look back
run like screaming fuck
they dive through the open door of pham vans
the rippling boards zoom on past it
earl quickly eases the door shut
earl turns to breathless rhonda
whispers pardon my french
its a tense edgy group
every movement made is in slow motion every word is a whisper
they gaze grimly out the windows at the silent deserted heat shimmering main street
val gingerly dabs iodine onto the cuts on rhondas legs
she doesnt even wince
you paying attention
this oughta hurt like hell
she smiles at him
rhonda contd so is that one of your usual jobs saving peoples lives
embarrassed first time for me
she gazes at him
he looks away
over at the bar pham holds up a new pair of pants for rhonda
oh thank you
grateful for something to do val eases over to get the pants
rhonda looks after him
then she becomes aware of someone staring at her its earl giving her a big cheshire cat grin that says what did i tell you
pham hands the pants to val
then pham and miguel reach simultaneously for a sods bottle and knock it over
it rolls all the way down the bar as a flurry of desperate hands try to stop it
it rolls off the end and crash
sure enough the building shudders
floor boards creak and bend as searching tentacles thump and scrape along under the floor
people close their eyes not even breathing
finally the noise subsides
everyone relaxes a little
so what are we gonna do you know
how long till they go away
shakes his head they got the patience of job
they just sit and goddamn wait til they hear something that sounds like lunch
we need a plan
ive got a plan
you and val take your truck get to the mountains
hike to bixby
get us some help
those scumsuckers are my radials pham
well we can take my truck then
you need major four wheel drive just to get up that jeep trail
they all shut up when they hear violas dog yapping in the distance
up the hill across from pham vans the old trailer looks perfectly peaceful
except violas dog keeps yapping
then we hear panicked viola
quiet you hateful thing
shut it up
shut the little bastard up
chuck him out the door
like a little hors doeuvre
we hear a loud whap
the dogs bark simply changes to piercing yelps
it would be funny except the trailer suddenly bucks upward hit from below as though by a pile driver
again and again the unseen creatures slam into the frail structure
oh god in heaven help me
the trailer is finally knocked right off its foundation
it tips over and tumbles all the way down the hill
as the dust clears all is silent
a huge hole is torn in the trailers floor
violas possessions are scattered everywhere
everyone stares in shock
oh my god
son of a bitchin lowlife putrid scum
gotta do something
gotta get the bastards
hopeless man what the hell can we do to those things
well were sure as hell not going to sit here being quiet for god knows how long
now wait a minute earl
i got enough food here to last us for weeks
those damn things cant wait around forever
pause we can do it
i mean if we have to right
everyone turns away from the windows gingerly sitting down glumly pondering this possibility
there is a long silence
then suddenly roar
the silence is shattered as pham vans big freezer compressor suddenly comes on
shut it off
pham runs to the freezer
its on off switch is buried behind stacks of soft drink cases
he tears at them like a madman toppling them this way and that
earl and val join him
but right behind pham the floor buckles up a monsters snout bursting through and engulfing one of his legs
the creature starts to back down into the jagged hole dragging screaming pham with it
val earl rhonda and miguel grab phams arms but are no match for the monster
it shakes and spins him like some gigantic dog effortlessly throwing them off relentlessly pulling pham down
the hole in the floor is too small for pham to fit through as one leg goes down the other is bent hideously backward
pham screams and screams as jagged wood tears into him bones snap ribs crack
the others grab him again but are utterly helpless
with vicious powerful jerks the creature yanks his man mangled body down
the last thing we see is his foot now folded back past his head and hes gone
val is wild with helpless anger
son of a bitch
son of a bitch
the floor bulges up in another place
a second creature
then a third coming right up under them
earl sprawls onto the bar
rhonda springs onto the shelves in the middle of the store knocking groceries everywhere
val and miguel climb up shelves which cover the rear wall of the store
the whole building shakes and shudders dust powdering down from the ceiling
flailing tentacles are everywhere slashing open food packages clouds of flour fill the air
val spots a hatch in the ceiling
earl leaps from the bar to the rear shelves
val and miguel slide sideways till theyre beneath the hatch then use the shelves as a ladder climbing up to the hatch
val pounds on it frantically
in the middle of the store rhonda leaps from shelf to shelf trying to get closer to where val is
soon she reaches the last one balancing precariously
but a creature tips over the first one
the shelves topple like dominoes crashing toward rhonda
she is half catapulted half jumps right through an open window ripping through the screen
val sees whats happened
with maniacal strength he smashes open the hatch and climbs out onto val rushes to the edge of the roof shouting rhonda
he looks down where rhonda fell
shes not there
he hears a whistle and is relieved to see rhonda is perched as high as she can get on the water tower near pham vans
its maybe twenty five feet tall a simple wood frame holding a big galvanized tank
the wooden legs stand on big concrete anchors buried in the ground
melvin peers terrified out the shed door up at the guys on pham vans roof
whats going on man
what the hell you doing up there
melvin shut the hell up
its too late
a creature strikes
the little shed shudders dust puffing from every old seam
in a split second melvin has climbed to the shed roof
nancy and mindy peer to the window surprised to see the men on pham vans roof
we hear vals shouting to the remaining townsfolk
get up on your roof
on your roof
they can come through the floor
the store shakes and shimmies
we hear the monsters thunderous crashing from below
cant you shout a little quieter
burt and heathers place about a mile from town is no nonsense functional ugly unpainted concrete walls no yard chain link fence
burt and heather drive up in their big blazer and park right beside the house
hot and tired they climb out each carrying a heavy scoped hunting rifle
burt peers toward perfection through binoculars during i cant believe it
no tracks no sign no spoor
yeah whatever they are youd think after they ate all those sheep theyd have to take a dump someplace
reacts to what he sees what the hells going on in town
the town is a very strange sight
its as though an invisible flood were in progress driving people to high ground
we see rhonda perched on the water tower val earl and miguel on the store roof nancy and mindy on their roof melvin on the storage shed nestor on his
val earl and miguel gaze out at the town trying to concoct a plan
suddenly earl perks up
the men speak softly
hey heres the plan nestors cadillac
his tires are nine hundred sixteens
we sprint for it grab the spare put it on our truck with our spare
val stares at him incredulous
how the hell long it take you to change a tire
sighs just about too damn long
bolt patterns probably wrong anyway
we need another plan
suddenly down in the store pham vans cb radio squawks loudly
the building shudders as the creatures again smash through the floor inside looking for the source of the noise
val earl and miguel scramble to the edge of the roof
the cb radio sits on a shelf near an open window
tentacles are feeling along the wall just below it
val appears out side the window upside down
he snatches the radio and is hauled straight up out of frame
miguel and earl haul val by the feet back up onto the roof
val quickly turns down the cb volume
whispers into mic burt now listen
we found out whats been killing people
a peculiar cross between bomb shelter and blue collar den burts wood paneled basement has all the comforts for post apocalypse living
burt talks on his cb
negative copy on that pham check your frequency
im on forty nine
a little louder burt can you hear me now
just barely pham
what are you all doing up on your roofs
what the hells going on
a few feet away heather works at their ammunition reloading bench
she dumps a few hundred empty cartridge cases into a case cleaner and switches it on
it hums loudly as it vibrates
the groping tentacles swiftly suck back below the floor
tilt up to see out the window some distance away a couple of old trash cans topple over as the creature streaks past beneath them making a bee line for
miguel points frantically at the trash cans
oh man theyre going man
i think theyre going for burt
val talks a little louder into the mic
intercut as needed
this is val
get out of your basement
take your radio
you and heather get up on your roof
then well talk okay
what the hell you doing back already
shouts burt get out
get up on your roof or someplace
we found out whats been killing people
theyre under the ground
whats under the ground
were not getting up on the roof
earth shelters the best
known that since i was a kid
we know what they are
theyre big things under the ground
much bigger than we thought
theyre coming after you
theyre coming right now
hearing that warning burt and heather go into a well honed drill
they grab their hunting rifles and take positions at basement windows
burt scans with the binoculars
he sees nothing
he glances at heather
into cb we dont see anything val
now what the hell are you talking about
val is frantic
how do you explain these things
theyre coming under ground
they they can dig like a son of a bitch
big monsters under the ground burt
now get the hell out
burt and heather exchange looks
has val gone nuts
then they hear a low rumble growing louder and louder
tools hanging over the work bench start to shake the decorative cow skulls on the wall rattle the overhead lights sway and then everything stops
dead silence except for the humming of the case cleaner
then the wall moves
the wood paneling bulges slightly
nails pop out
the wall is pushed again the paneling cracks
a cow skull falls
burt and heather level their rifles and a huge creature pushes right through the wall
fully half its bulbous spiked body writhes into the center of the room great multi part jaws drooling open hook tentacles lashing out
the three men can hear the chaos over the cb
the cb goes dead
the men stare numbly
then drifting across the desert a soft popping sound
the men perk up they know what it is distant gunfire
the gunfire is deafening as burt and heather blast away
globby blood spurts from a dozen wounds and the creature pulls back a little
the couple keeps firing until magazines are empty
the creature lunges forward again
pan with burt and heather to reveal a wall of the basement we havent seen until now a wall covered with guns hand guns long guns riot guns flare guns
antique guns military guns elephant guns
heather grabs an hk assault rifle slams in two magazines bottoms taped end to end and opens fire
a hook tentacle snags her boot yanking her right off her feet
burt pumps out eight devastating blasts from a twelve gauge riot gun severing the tentacle
heather is on her feet in an instant
she expertly flops her double magazine over loading the full one taped upside down to it and opens fire again
burt grabs an ar semi auto and joins her
they lay down massive fire virtually disappearing in muzzle flash and smoke
ejected shell cases clatter and clang all around the room
the guns are empty
the creature is still coming
they back down the wall desperately grabbing weapons one after another a lever action a magnum handgun even a flare gun which heather fires right into the creatures mouth
shrieking in pain the horrid thing thing keeps wriggling burt and heather scramble up over a desk to keep something between them and it
burt smashes open a fancy glass case holding a huge four gauge elephant gun
he slams in two gigantic cartridges nearly an inch in diameter
the concussion literally shakes the building
the recoil slams burt back against the wall
the monster bullets tear monster holes in the monster
great gouts of curdles blood spew from it burt hit an artery or something
the beast convulses grotesquely then collapses deflating like a beached whale
burt and heather stagger together and hug each other fervently
they stare dumbfounded at the massive dead horror
burt suddenly shouts vehemently broke into the wrong goddamn rec room didnt you you bastard
val earl and miguel listen to the silence hoping for some sign that their friends are alive
suddenly burt v
filter we killed it you got that
we killed that motherfucker
it takes a moment for this to sink in then the men cheer as quietly as possible
roger that burt
uh be advised however there are four more repeat four more motherfuckers
burt and heather dash out onto the roof laden with weapons ammo boxes and their cb radio
they hit the deck assorted rifles and the elephant gun the ready
val shouts to everyone they got one
they killed one of the sons of bitches
melvin pumps his fist in the air
way to go dudes
nancy and mindy hug each other
perched on his spanish tile roof nestor pours coffee from his thermos and raises his cup in a toast
rhonda lets out a whoop
the men sit temporarily jubilant
well i guess we dont get to make fun of burts lifestyle anymore huh
val grabs the cb mic
burt any chance you can get the rest of them
burt and heather peer from their fortress like roof
burt spots earth bulging up near the foundation of his house
into cb one second val
he grabs the elephant gun and takes two well aimed shots two deafening booms which echo off the distant mountains
but the bullets bury themselves harmlessly in the dirt
the bulge in the dirt moves calmly away and sinks from view
heather shakes her head
youre not getting any penetration even with the elephant gun
into cb val we cant get them
never figured on having to shoot through dirt
best goddamn bullet stop there is
the men are disappointed
thats not what they wanted to hear from burt
then earl perks up and grab the cb mic
into cb okay burt listen
forget shooting them
tell me this can you get to your truck
youve got the only truck in the valley that can make it up that damn jeep trail
so heres the plan you and heather go for help
get to the mountains
but rhonda interrupts pointing urgently from the water tower
theyre up to something
val earl and miguel rush to the edge of the roof and look down where shes pointing a creature is running its tentacles along the buildings foundation
its a strange more studied movement than weve seen before
to rhonda whats it doing
why do you all keep asking me
they all stare nervously down as the tentacles feel their way along the wall moving toward a corner of the building
suddenly miguel spots something down the next wall
hey theres another one coming
another set of tentacles is feeling along the adjacent wall
the two creatures meet at the corner their tentacles touch ing rather like ants antennae
they they submerge tenta cles zipping into the earth
nothing happens for a moment
then the corner of the building suddenly heaves up a couple of feet
clapboard siding splits
a warped window shatters
we dont see the creatures only the effect of their shoving from below
the men nearly lose their balance
then the corner sinks back down
what the hell was that all about
nancy and mindy are still huddled on the roof
they dont make a sound
theyre startled when the house suddenly groans and tilts as creatures give it a tentative shove
nancy and mindy frantically cling to the peak of the smooth roof
the picture windows shatters
we hear beams pop and crack dishes crash off shelves
the front screen door swings open
at last the house slowly settles back down
the men are watching nancys house tensely
they werent making no noise
why they bothering them for
mind racing theyre studying the buildings
trying to figure them out
rhonda chimes in from the water tower
yeah theyre confused
they can feel our vibrations but they cant find us
theyre working together too
yeah like they got a plan
breaker there earl
what do you want us to do
into cb hang on burt
the bastards are up to something
straddling the peak of his steeply sloping roof
nestor grabs on in panic as the creatures lift the place up slowly
the roof warps spanish tiles shatter and rain down on the ground
this causes a flurry of activity
tentacles snake around where the tiles fell
we hear creatures crash through inside snorting and huffing
they attack the house in earnest shaking it violently pushing the front wall out till it falls flat
the roof collapses on that side
nestor cant hang on
he slides all the way down landing across a window on the flattened wall
the next instant hes grabbed and pulled through the window right into the ground
he dolly along the ground heading toward the storage shed where melvin is
all we can see is dirt but we can still hear nestor screaming underground
his screams get more and more faint as dolly ends on close on horrified melvin as he rocks back and forth autistically
oh wow man
no fucking way man
nancy comforts mindy
rhonda turns away
val earl and miguel stare in horror and disbelief
miguel crosses himself
theyre in worse trouble than they thought
they knocked his place down on purpose man
theyre gonna tear this whole town out from under us
burt and heathers truck is parked in foreground
the couple is up on the roof in background
burt prowls along the edge of the roof with the elephant gun
heather mans the c
were in deep shit over here
lets change that plan
a hump of dirt raises near the base of the house
burt jerks the rifle to his shoulder and squeezes off a shot
the hump moves away from the house
knock it off burt
i think i scared it
forget going for help
well all be dead long before you get back
still moving away the hump of dirt passes under the side walk rippling the flagstones gently
into cb were here val
just tell us what you need
theyre tearing down the houses here
we all gotta get outta here together
the hump of dirt passes under burt and heathers truck rocking the vehicle slightly
were with you val
well come get everybody
just hang on tight
the trucks security alarm starts booping
burt and heather stare down helplessly as the noisy truck is furiously attacked by the frenzied creatures
dust flies as metal rips and tires shred
val earl and miguel listen in disbelief to the distant truck alarm
it finally sputters and dies
val were going to have to forget about the truck
into cb yeah heather we got you
theyve hit rock bottom
they sit in helpless desperate silence
over on the storage shed roof melvin is losing it hey you better think of something man
you gotta do something
you and val man
miguel nods in agreement
val and earl stare at him incredulous
since when the hells every goddamn thing up to us
flatly you guys do all the odd jobs
val just stares at her
the store shudders creaks and groans
the creatures are back
one corner of the store lifts up beams splintering
then another corner lifts up
the roof tilts like the deck of a storm tossed ship
from now on the monsters shake and ram the building almost constantly
hanging on tight the men peer over the edge
we dont have a hell of a lot of time here
meanwhile rhonda tries her desperate best to be logical look the situation hasnt changed
we still have to get to solid rock
there must be some way
shouts angry like what theres nothing left thatll make it to the mountains
hey val quiet man
we need a helicopter is what we need or a goddamn tank
wait a minute
could we take the cat
its slower than hell
yeah but it weighs better than thirty tons
no way they could stop it
we cant all fit on that bulldozer
but val is warming to the idea
we could pull something
we could i dont know drag a car behind it
a car huh
like a big armored car
need something bigger tougher
our truck maybe
or hell that old semi trailer
its tires are flat
the cat can pull any thing
all right we just roll on out of here
we got a plan
they squint at the bulldozer way in the distance
earl contd course thats one helluva long walk
they stare grimly momentarily stuck for an idea
then listen they only respond to vibration right
distract them somehow
something to keep them busy
we need a decoy
hey melvin you wanna make a buck
miguel grabs earl and points down at little garden tractor in a jumble of pham vans equipment and tools near the side of the store
hey how about the tractor
start him up
let him go by itself
let those things chase it all over is they like that noise
nodding not bad
to val what do you think
the store takes a heavy hit
the front porch collapses with a terrific crash
i think the grounds getting closer
i think we do it
were gonna save our asses here
how are you going to know theyre all following it
we got two right here
val scrambles to the highest point of the sagging roof and shouts to nancy
val contd nancy we gotta find all four of them
how many you got over there
the house shuddering and shaking
i think one
earl grabs the cb mic
into cb burt heather we got a little sort of a plan going here maybe
can you tell if youve still got any of those things out at your place
into cb yeah still got one poking around
let us know if it starts moving burt
val and earl have lowered miguel down to a window sill right above the garden tractor
he has used his kerchief to tie the steering wheel to keep the front wheels straight
he jams the throttle open and signals thumbs up to val and earl above
val and earl stride purposefully toward the opposite end of the roof
realizing they have the same idea each one tries to edge ahead of the other
im making the run to the cat
like hell you are
im faster than you
im best at driving the cat
only if something happens to me
earl contd look youd better listen
im older and wiser
yeah well youre half right
earl raises a fist the challenge
they do scissors rock paper
one two three
val contd damn
guess i have to do it
shakes his head i won
i pick who does it
val glares at him
earls obviously determined
earl contd ready when you are miguel
earl positions himself nervous as hell ready to leap at the right moment
miguel leans out precariously and pulls the tractors starter cord
on the second try it starts
he slams it into gear and sends it out toward open desert
the store shakes under miguel almost knocking him off the window sill as two humps of dirt pursue the noisy tractor
there they go
theyre chasing it
a spout of dust erupts near the foundation as the creature beneath zooms away toward the new sound
nancy whispers its going
then shouts there goes this one
the cb radio squawks hey this guy just took off like a shot
whatd you people do
earl is poised to leap
val steps up and slaps him on the back
watch your ass shithead
dont worry about me jerkoff
val instantly elbows earl hard in the stomach
as earl doubles over val springs off the edge of the roof
earl contd you goddamn suicidal son of a bitch
we see val running for all hes worth and theres the bulldozer at the edge of town a long way away
low camera pursues the garden tractor as it bounces along
val charges across the vast open area that separates him from the bulldozer
we can hear the tractor droning along in the background
the tractor suddenly takes a bad bounce and flips over
the engine dies
earl rhonda and miguel have seen the tractor take a header
oh my god
vals crunching boots seem incredibly loud in the sudden silence
he hesitates glancing over his shoulder
hes totally out in the open halfway to the bulldozer
should he run back or go forward
he decides to go for the bulldozer
all four creatures are now heading for val
intercut four slightly different low camera angles speeding over the ground racing after him
he strains to the limit breaths coming in painful rasps but the creatures are closing in on him with chilling ease
everyone watches in horror
hell never make it
theyre gonna get him
yells val hears her and stops dead
so do the creatures
maybe twenty feet away their giant snouts poke up out of the ground one two three four
val stands trembling
the creatures softly shuffle back and forth searching blindly for him hook tentacles feeling everywhere
one tentacle sweeps toward vals boot
he manages to lift his foot just in time letting the tentacle pass beneath it
he balances precariously like a flamingo
they cant find him
pause okay okay
we gotta make some noise
a lot of noise
hey he starts jumping noisily up and down
miguel joins in cursing the monsters in spanish
rhonda kicks and shouts
but its obvious they need some thing louder
she spots the aging outlet pipe coming from the water tank
bracing herself she kicks at it with both feet
it finally gives way at a rusted joint
a torrent of water blasts out thundering into the dirt
all the creatures wheel about in the dirt and zoom off toward town
val breathes a big sigh of relief and sprints to the bulldozer
that did it girl
goddamn good thinking
a mass of tentacles and snouts swirl through the big puddle where the water if falling
the creatures breathing throws up spouts of muddy water
rhonda looks down nervously
earl calls reassuringly from pham vans dont worry
no way they can lift that tower
i mean its really heavy
the dirt begins to cave in around the towers footing
the creatures are digging the dirt away
the water tower tilts ever so slightly creaking and groaning
rhonda frantically grabs a handhold
theyre not trying to lift it
val lands in the drivers seat and turns the engine over it doesnt start
the old machine starts
val slams it into reverse and backs up toward the semi trailer
the water tower is starting to tilt seriously
water spills over the top edge of the tank drenching rhonda
val has used heavy chains on the back of the bulldozer to jerry rig a hitch to the semi trailer
now he scrambles back into the drivers seat
he guns the engine wrenching the old semi trailer from years of dried mud and tumbleweeds
ancient tires disintegrate
rusted wheels screech and complain but it moves
val lets out a whoop and heads full tilt for town
hes suddenly shocked as he sees rhondas in big trouble
she scrambles to the high side of the tower platform
the towers going to tip over at any moment
its roof slides off and crashes into the street
on pham vans miguel and earl are tearing apart the swamp cooler throwing pieces of it off the roof trying to distract the creatures but they cant compete with the
noise from the water
in bg the bulldozer rumbles toward the tower at top speed an excruciatingly slow eight miles per hour
the tremendously heavy water tank suddenly tears loose sliding off its platform nearly carrying rhonda with it
she ends up hanging from a cross beam as the water tank splatters like an enormous egg below sending a small tidal wave down the street
the remains of the tower tilt crazily nearly forty five degrees
the bulldozer grinds closer and closer
rhonda tries to climb up but the jostling and shuddering of the tower keeps her dangling precariously
suddenly she falls
and lands in the dirt
the creatures zero in on her
she turns wildly and leaps for the blade of the approaching bulldozer
the blade is only inches off the ground but val swiftly raises it lifting rhonda high into the air just above the grasping tentacles
as rhonda climbs down into the cab val heads the bulldozer over to pham vans and stops
almost as soon as he does creatures attack a frenzy of tentacles grabbing at all sides of the massive earth moving machine slithering into the treads
val and rhonda watch this nervously as earl and miguel quickly clamber from the roof down into the protective steel belly of the semi trailer
val mentally crosses his fingers and sends the bulldozer roaring forward
it effortlessly tears loose from the tentacles grinding one to pulp in its treads
the creature shrieks in pain
the humans cheer
at last theyve got the upper hand
melvin dances merrily and noisily on the metal rooftop
way to go
dumb fucking worms
now haul ass over here man
get me off of here
the flimsy shed seems almost to explode as a furious creature roars up inside
the walls buckle out
the whole structure sags
melvin scrambles to peak of the roof
as the unseen creature thrashes around inside the shed the walls topple outward and the roof drops to the ground like a pancake
melvin has lost all self control and just keeps screaming
val pulls along side jumps down onto the tread and reaches out to melvin
but just as they join hands the creature hits the roof from beneath dragging it several feet
val is yanked off the bulldozer and lands with nelvin on the roof
the creature slams into the roof repeatedly but the corrugated metal is both light and resilient
it bends but the frustrated monster cant get enough bite to tear through it
val and melvin straddle the peak of the roof trying desperately to hang on as it heaves up buckling like a bronco
earl scrambles into the bulldozer drivers seat and heads after them at full throttle the big diesel roaring
melvin and val prepare to jump onto the bulldozer but just before it reaches them the roof suddenly starts to slide like some mad flying carpet carried from beneath by
val hangs on like a rodeo rider struggling to keep fear crazed melvin from tumbling off
the roof zigs and zags spins and twists
melvin and val wont be shaken loose
earl does his best to head it off but its hard to predict which way the roof will scoot next
the rood careens alongside the edge of a dirt walled drainage ditch then suddenly skitters sideways and plunges over the edge
melvin and val tumble to the bottom
as they jump to their feet we got about three seconds
val sees almost right above them an exposed pipe which spans the ditch
he shoves melvin toward it
they leap up and grab the pipe pulling their legs up as high as they can
an instant later the creature blasts through one wall of the ditch roars past beneath them and burrows into the opposite wall
earl brings the bulldozer to a thundering stop next to them
well come on
nancy and mindy huddle together on their roof
the upraised scoop blade of the bulldozer comes into shot with val riding it
he helps them step across into it
burt is using a hacksaw to cut lengths from a heavy vertical pipe to which his tv antenna was anchored
heather works with the sections burt has already cut off
she is filling them with gunpowder from reloading cannisters and hammering the ends shut theyre making bombs
then they hear rumbling
what is it more creatures
theyre surprised by the odd sight of the strange contraption approaching
impressed god damn
val climbs up on the bulldozer roll cage so hes about even with heather and burt
a creature occasionally slams into the underside of the bulldozer of the semi trailer rocking them slightly throwing up clouds of dust
lets go you two
were headed for the mountains
in a minute
he grabs a coil of blackpowder cannon fuse
he cuts off a length and stuffs it in the end of one of the pipe bombs during come on burt we cant hold still long
theyre damn smart and getting smarter by the minute
burt hefts the finished bomb
weve got some new things to teach them
theyll sink this rig just like a boat
just then the bulldozer starts to tilt sideways creatures digging dirt away beneath it
earl guns it forward out of the depression theyre making
theyre doing it now
they try it every time we hold still
burt and heather are impressed
they rush around the rooftop gathering food ammo guns the finished bombs handing them to impatient val who hands them down to people in the semi trailer during jesus christ
were only going nine miles
be there in two hours tops
yeah well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way right
he holds up to rifles to heather the hk assault rifle and another elephant gun
what do you think
max firepower or
id go for penetration
the shooting solids less ammo to carry anyway
everyone on the bulldozer and semi trailer shouts adlib come on
dust flies up
the bulldozer tilts
earl guns it forward again
heather and burt grab a few more things and leap down into the semi trailer
give me a gun
ill take one
i wouldnt give you a gun if it was world war three
earl pilots the strange looking contraption out into the desert
burt and heather watch their fortress home recede
food for five years
a thousand gallons of gas
looks heavenward underground goddamn monsters
heather puts a consoling arm around him
the bulldozer easily lumbers along the really rough road we saw val and earls truck struggle over the other morning
as they come closer we see burt and heather riding shotgun he sitting out in the bulldozers scoop she on the rear of the semi trailer elephant guns at the
val earl and rhonda are in the cab
its late afternoon sun casting dramatic shadows across the beautiful desert
we are wide on the bizarre vehicle resolutely grinding along not far from the cliffs nearing the mountains ahead
as they scan the desert the people are feeling like they may get out of this after all
earl calls back to the people in the semi trailer
any sign ofem
maybe they just gave up you know
yeah the bulldozers too much for them man
as they top a gentle rise burt excitedly points ahead
there we go solid rock
but then heather points up ahead to one side
perhaps two hundred yards from them a huge cloud of dust wells up from behind big boulders
everyone stares uneasily at the billowing cloud
is it them
what else could it be
whatre they doing
maybe theyre taking a dump
were not going over there right
we go straight
what the hell are they doing
theyre up to something
i dont care what theyre doing as long as theyre doing it way over there
earl shoves the throttle all the way
the engine screams
we move in through the cloud of dust
dirt is flying by the ton out of en eight foot diameter hole in the ground
a huge mound of the tunneled out dirt is already piled high
the creatures are digging a tunnel but why
we watch the bulldozer rumbling along
it seems unstop able
the mountains and safety are barely a mile away when the earth caves in
the bulldozer plunges nose first the machine ends up half buried at a steep angle
the semi trailer is right on the edge of the pit
everyone is shaken bruised bloodied
val earl and rhonda look frantically for burt who was riding out front in the scoop
theyre relieved to see him clawing his way out of pit
val hauls him up and all four of them now leap into the semi trailer
as they come to rest val slowly realizes whats happened
they dug a trap
i cant believe this
the idling bulldozer engine coughs and dies
there is a moments crushing silence
then the dreaded digging begins
dust boils up around the semi trailer creatures digging from below
the semi trailer shakes and shudders slowly sinking
the people huddle together in sheer panic
val and earl grab the nearest of burt and heathers guns and fire wildly hope lessly down at the dirt
ricochets whine into the distance
burt grimly digs an overloaded knapsack for one of his pipe bombs
he leaps up between val and earl and lights the fuse looking for a target
he tosses the bomb at some churning earth and dives back into the semi trailer
burt contd keep your heads down
the explosion throws up a big plume of dust and rocks
we hear a new very strange sound of pain from the creatures
the semi trailer instantly stops shaking
the creatures have stopped digging
all is quiet
the people peer up over the edge of the semi trailer looking all around
then there they are
numerous spurts of dust mark their paths as they race madly away fanning out from the semi trailer
did you get one
no theres still four of them
theres like four different dust trails
sure got their attention though
nice going burt
to earl earl what about the cat
earls already staring down at the bulldozer
its down for the count
val looks around
toward the cliffs he sees a big rock outcrop
rhonda points in the opposite direction from where val is looking
here they come
theyre coming back
heather unexpectedly fire two deafening blasts from her elephant gun at the approaching creatures then shakes her head frustrated
theyre still coming
come on everybody
we gotta run for those rocks over there
jesus val its pretty far
theyll get us
there sure as hell get us if we stay here
wait wait listen
burt do you have any more of those things
damn right i do
well what is you throw one that way the way we want to go
points toward rocks then when the explosion happens
if it drives them away again
we all run like goddamn bastards
to earl pardon my french
with a jolt the semi trailer begins shaking and shuddering again sinking smiling
what if it doesnt scare them
what if they dont run
i dont think it does scare them
it hurts them
theyre so sensitive to sound they have to run
it hurts too much
glances all around
shes got my vote
were gonna run
val squats in front of tear streaked mindy
val contd mindy you understand what were going to do
off her nod and dont worry they cant get us once were on those rocks
i dont know man
theyre too fast
you cant outrun them no way
as burt readies another bomb he pauses to hand bug eyed melvin a huge ruger super redhawk magnum handgun
thisll makeem think twice
melvins eyes bug out further
burt lights his bomb
burt contd heads down
he hurls the bomb
again we hear the creatures unearthly shriek of pain
rhondas on her feet before the rocks stop falling
she spots the creatures
there they go
earl lets out a war wild whoop
crane up with them as everyone piles out of the semi trailer like soldiers out of a trench they charge across no mans land
melvin runs like a demon
he tries to shoot at the first thing he sees but the gun just clicks over and over empty
burt you bastard
enraged he doubles his speed trying to overtake burt
mindy cant keep up
nancy tries to pull her along
val and earl swoop in grab mindy under either arm and carry her between them
the ground heaves violently as the retreating monsters angrily wheel about and charge back after the humans
big slabs jutting this way and that a rock iceberg in a sand ocean
the people scramble onto it amid whoops of joy and relief
melvin charges up to burt you asshole
theres no bullets in this gun
got you moving didnt it
burts line gets a laugh from people but then tentacles burst up on all sides of the rock probing feeling
the effect is instantly sobering
burt swiftly grabs out his remaining bombs six of them and holds one ready
but theyre in no immediate danger
could we make it to the mountains
gestures to burts bombs no way
wed need fifty of those things
the hopelessness of the situation suddenly hits val earl and rhonda
after a moment well
were not getting off this rock
not going to pole vault anywhere
thats for sure
whats the matter with you
what are you talking about
theyll just wait out there till were dead
thats what they do
as this sinks in burt loses his cool igniting an argument
well for chrissake we could have made a stand at our place
we had food water
you cant fightem that way
you two jackasses hauled us way the hell out here
well who put you two in charge
those animals would have killed you
everyone stares in surprise at normally quiet nancy
nancy contd softly you havent seen what they can do
calmer theyd have dug your place out from under you in half an hour
theres a long grim silence
everyone sits glumly
finally burt picks up a bomb and contemplates it losing it if it comes to starvation i know what im doing
take one of these
walk right out there with the fuse lit
stuff it down my pants and let em take me down
heather puts a soothing hand on his shoulder
but now earl brightens a little
you know thats not a bad idea
the others react
is earl nuts
no i mean it gives me an idea
going fishing like
in the open desert a rock lands
val and rhonda are throwing them from the rock outcrop
val earl rhonda and burt have moved away from the main group to another section of the rock outcrop where intervening boulders will protect everyone from an explosion
earl has tied a bomb to some nylon rope form one of burts knapsacks
burt places the other bombs safely out of the way behind a ledge
meanwhile val and rhonda keep throwing rocks
soon the ground shifts
right straight out in front of you
burt has his coil of fuse
how much you think
i dont know
theyre pretty quick
burt nods expertly eyeballing a fifteen second length and snipping it off
as he stuffs it into the bomb what the hell is that anyway
what do you use it for
matter of fact my cannon
the bomb is ready its moment of truth
earl digs in his pocket for the lighter but val has it
val nervously leans over to light the fuse but then frowns as he sees how earl is holding the rope
come on youre not going to do your lasso thing
hey just cause youre no good with a rope
val shakes his head and lights the fuse
earl whirls the bomb on the end of its rope like a lasso and lets it fly out as far as he can
then he starts pulling it back in along the ground like a fishing lure
rhonda stares at her watch as they all sink down behind the protective boulder
take the bait
suddenly a snout subtly surfaces and gulps down the bomb
a tense two seconds later kabooom
its a volcano of gory creature parts
they splatter all over
the remaining creatures shriek and race away again
the people cheer wildly
val earl rhonda and burt prepare to try again
this time val has the rope and a new bomb
rhonda stands by him ready with the lighter
earl lobs rocks out into the desert
where the hell are they
hope they didnt wise up
pointing nope there
rhonda shakily lights the fuse
val heaves the bomb out and starts trolling
the creature swallows it
everyone drops down behind the boulder val impulsively grabbing a second bomb
they tense with anticipatory glee but the creature suddenly spits its bomb back out it sails back right over their heads
it strikes the rocks above them skittering down a crevice and landing in burts pile of bombs
val earl and rhonda scatter
burt dives backward over a rock ledge
all the bombs explode throwing rocks every where
the creatures streak away
val earl and rhonda sprawl into the dirt half stunned
when the panic is over val and earl realize where they are fifty yards out in open desert
so is rhonda off at an angle from them
only burt is safe on the rock outcrop
and the creatures are coming back fast
the stranded trio starts back for the outcrop but the creatures burst up ahead of them one blocking rhondas path the other two cutting val and earl off
the creatures roar toward their easy prey
val and earl freeze
the ground bulges as the creatures skid to a halt not ten feet from them
rhonda stands stock still some fifty feet away eyeing her own creature
over on the outcrop with the main group of people heather sizes up the situation
everyone starts hopping up and down yelling screaming and clapping
burt even runs a few feet out from the rocks firing a pistol into the dirt
the crowd keeps up the ruckus
the creatures are distracted by the noise but this time they dont automatically go after it
their big snouts turn uncertainly this way and that
but they just stay where they are
their hook tentacles slide out feeling all around
earl whispers theyre not falling for it
heather takes careful aim with her elephant gun
ill makeem pay attention goddamnit
but before she can fire the creatures mysteriously sink from view
val rhonda and earl remain frozen
what the hell is going on
nothing happens then a huge hump of earth suddenly wells up near rhonda
it sinks back down as fast as it appeared
its like the creature suddenly lifted its whole body almost to the surface then submerged again
another hump rises and falls right near val and earl
theres a pause as the men whisper theyre
theyre trying to make us move
or just knock us over
look use the bomb
its out last one
we cant kill them all
the creatures try another random barrage of humps some coming perilously close
they know theyll eventually topple their prey
one comes so close to val and earl that pebbles roll down its sides into their boots
use the fucking bomb
so we get back on that rock and in three days were dead anyway
slowly terrified i want to live for the three days
more humps rise and fall
val gives in
he signals rhonda gesturing with the bomb
hell set it off driving away the creatures and theyll all run back to the outcrop
val digs for the lighter
doesnt have it
earl digs for it too
but he doesnt have it either
they go dead pale
how can that be
they look across fifty feet of deadly open ground trembling rhonda holds up the lighter
over on the outcrop burt shouts whats wrong
use the bomb for godsake
val signals to rhonda to throw the lighter
but just before she does a hump starts rising directly under her
she fights to keep her balance struggling to keep from taking that single step which will instantly tell the creatures where she is
but theres no hope
the hump jerks higher
her boots slip down the gravelly side
instantly the creature twists toward her its hungry mouth erupting out of the dirt
she screams and dashes for val and earl
they run to meet her
the other creatures surface
the trio is cut off from the rock outcrop
val and earl link up with rhonda and they all run madly while rhonda tries to light vals bomb fuse
but suddenly val yanks the bomb away
he veers off in a new direction
startled earl and rhonda have no choice but to follow
as they desperately try to catch up to val gasping what the hell are you doing
earl looks up ahead
theyre headed right for the massive cliffs
earls eyes bug out
in seconds theyll be right at the brink with nowhere to run
this better be one great plan
as they skid to a stop at the very brink val breaks off the bomb fuse leaving only one inch of it
he whirls to check the progress of the advancing creatures
he holds the bomb out to rhonda
she instantly tries to light it
he grabs her wrist so hard it hurts
light it man
not yet not yet
the charging creatures are almost underfoot
finally val pulls rhondas hand over to light the fuse
instantly he hurls the bomb as far as he can behind the creatures
you threw it behind them
the ground opens under their feet
tentacles snake toward val and earl
a horrid mouth clamps onto rhondas boot
she screams as it starts to pull her down
the bomb explodes
the creatures shriek in pain instantly releasing their prey and racing away from the painful shock wave in the only direction they can right out through the face of the
cliffs the huge shrieking creatures seem to hang in mid air for a moment their grotesque bodies undulating in pain
and then they fall
and fall and fall a thousand feet
the creatures land on massive jagged rocks exploding like immense horrid watermelons
multi colored gore festoons the whole cliff face
tilt up to see three tiny figures standing at the top of the cliff
val peers down at the distant creatures for a long time
then he notices earl and rhonda are staring at him
where the hell did he get an idea like that
after a moment well it just suddenly hit me you know
they turn and head back toward the others
they laugh as they realize how stealthily they are walking
val starts taking big exaggerated stomping steps
rhonda and earl follow suit
the trio goes off arm in arm stomping merrily
val and earl roll two scavenged truck wheels down the street toward their own truck which is up on jacks two wheels missing
mindy races past excitedly
a highway maintenance truck is rolling into town followed by a police car
the townsfolk happily swarm around the maintenance men and police officer who gape at the destroyed town
val and earl eagerly start bolting on one of their new wheels
now soon as we hit bixby we start making phone calls
we could make some real money off this whole thing get in people magazine
people hell national geographic sell the movie rights
were going straight from blue collar to white collar
but no ties
rhonda pulls up in her truck leans out and snaps their picture with a top of the line nikon
burt loaned me his camera
youre really leaving huh
you gonna be staying up here
theres going to be major research up here
first thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug up
an awkward pause
finally she extends her hand to them
val just gives it a quick shake
rhonda contd uh
well maybe ill see you two sometime
to val and thanks for everything you know saving my life and stuff
she gazes at him just a hint of something in her eyes
earl springs to attention
is the boy blind then rhonda snaps out of it
she drives off
earl stares at val who starts putting the second wheel on the truck
christ val maybe shes not your type but you could at least be civil
youre not civil youre glum
we got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me
earl freezes as a bell goes off in his head
earl contd oh my god
she got to you
you do like her
somebody paying you to do this
she just practically asked you for a date
what the hell is wrong
val glares at earl for a moment
earl get real
what does she need with a guy like me
earl is dumbfounded
what was that
all this time shes not good enough for you
now suddenly youre not good enough for her
god my work is never done
you dont decide is youre worthless she does
but you gotta give her a chance
val lowers the jack letting the truck down
earl im not gonna make a fool of myself
you got that covered
earl stands there fuming mind racing
a last ditch idea hits home we see a devilish glint in his eye
fine make the mistakes i did
i think ill just be playing this hand myself
she likes both of us
we both helped her out
you are so full of shit
think about this she aint as narrow minded as you
ill lay odds shes looking for character in a man
for my part id be proud to have her
id goddamn worship her
earl hops into the truck
earl contd im going out there right now help her take those pictures
set up her seismo jiggers
whatever she wants
who the hell knows whatll happen
earl starts to drive off
val springs into the passenger seat
through the trucks rear window we see val raise his hand in the challenge
they do a round of scissors rock paper but its a tie
they go again
