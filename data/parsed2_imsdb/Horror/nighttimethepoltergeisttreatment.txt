the poltergeist treatment written by steven spielberg march steven freeling is a successful husband father and provider
his innate practicality and above average intelligence have made him a successful real estate salesman for a large agency in a nearby community
he is well liked and respected by his boss and co workers and is considered an upstanding member of his community
nora freeling now was married at and pregnant at
she with active help from steven is in the process of raising children ranging in age from to
during this time she has also managed to juggle her family life well enough to earn a degree in teaching and is active in the community as a substitute teacher
nora and steven are close enough in age to their own children that the experiences of a strict upbringing whippings edicts and traditions are still fresh memories
thus has the generational pendulum swung
they govern their domain with chummy lenience and serious but good natured discipline
they treat their children with respect and humanity and are afforded the courtesy of being treated the same
they are a close open and loving family fairly typical of this neighborhood
the children sweeny age angel age lawrence age and carol ann age are children of the s
they watch more tv than they should see all the pg movies at the local six plex and do just enough homework to get by in school
they participate in a healthy amount of sibling teasing and fighting with subjects ranging from which tv show should be aired to who stole whos toys
they are gregarious children who all have best friends nd best friends rd best friends
carol ann is typically precocious for a child with much older brothers and sisters
they family generally spends quiet evenings together with bed time dictated at
elmer the last member of the freeling family is a silver buff cocker spaniel who has been a member of the family almost as long as the oldest child
tagina barrins is a year old medium
she has studied under some of the well known psychics of the times and is a regular contributor to the national enquirer this being the only accepting outlet for her
communications with the other side
she is eccentric in her manner of dress and speech but is sincere in her beliefs and very probably a true psychic
why must all tales of ghosts and hauntings find their settings in gothic cobwebbed mansions miles away from civilization
where does an audience draw the line between what is real and what is fantastic
night time is the story of a frightening occurence not in a haunted house on a hill but in the center of middle class suburbia
the freelings a middle class family live at wanda a four bedroom three and one half bath ranch style house
it is a typical tract house located at the end of one of the several hundred cul de sacs in a shopping mall district called vista
as its name implies the center of activity is a large modern shopping center complex
this large child infested community holds five schools two elementary two junior high and one high school
on the neatly manicured rolling hill fringes of town are a well used man made lake and the communitys rec center
this chicago suburb is one of many similar communities springing up every day
its planners goal to bring families and the conveniences of life closer together
it is a quiet evening
the children have gone to bed allowing nora and steven their cherished hours alone
they go to their bedroom turn the tv on to the tonight show something they do almost every night and prepare for a well deserved evening of rest and relaxation
they are lulled to sleep by the voices on the television set
the rest of the evenings programming the late late movie the broadcast of the local news the sign off consisting of the blue angels performing to strains of the star
spangled banner color bars and test patterns the local sign off
and finally static or white noise
it is through this blizzard of static snow and beyond the slumbered breathing of nora and steven that the first flash of paranormal communication occurs
the television moans something chillingly audible and the static non picture rearranges into something indistinguishable
steven turns over in his sleep but does not awaken
the days that follow bring a stream of odd but not necessarily suspicious occurrences
periodic phantom phone calls break the silence in the middle of the night
on the other end nothing but static noise similar to the static of the blank night television
food disappears from the cupboards and refrigerator and a special lemon meringue pie is marred by nibbling fingers
but with children in the house and the childrens friends the blame is not easily fixed
the furniture slightly at first is rearranged
just enough to annoy a meticulous mother not enough to cause suspicion
elmer the family dog begins wandering to a certain alcove in the house
he then sits there facing the wall occasionally whimpering toward it reaching out his paw and scratching at the air
but well hes getting old and if people can get senile so can dogs
angel their year old daughter while cleaning out the garage finds an old record of th century songs supposedly sung by pioneers as they crossed the country
it becomes her favorite album and is played all the time
she finds it soothing and somehow familiar
the songs become a part of her life humming them as she studies walks to school and does her daily chores
but then things start happening
annoying things inexplicable things nerve fraying things
the television starts to change channels by itself to news station and cartoons specifically
the children bright and inventive are at first blamed for creating some gadget to annoy and frighten your mother
having proven innocence or at least protested enough steven goes next door to see if the neighbors are playing tricks with their remote controls
but the neighbors arent home
and a phone call to a friend assures steven that a friends remote control wouldnt work on his set anyhow
the freelings are bird lovers
they have built a beautiful aviary which has become the home of many different kinds colors and sizes of birds
the aviary is located on a patio that is attached to the house
steven and nora awaken one early morning to find birds flying all over the house
at first angry at the children for not closing the cage steve wakes them and takes them all downstairs for a lecture on closing and locking the bird cage
but upon entering the porch everyone is silenced by something the sight of the aviary torn open a feat accomplished by something beyond human strength
but no noise had awakened them
what is going on
windows and doors open and close seemingly by themselves
in the middle of the night someone has to go downstairs to re bolt a window or re lock a door
furniture is being moved around more obviously now
nora preparing a meal in the kitchen hears someone swimming in the pool
she calls outside for whoever it is to get out and get ready for dinner
her calls are ignored
she goes outside to the sight of something invisible doing what looks like laps in the pool or perhaps we the audience see something doing laps but when nora gets
out there it is gone
this could make her even more nervous thinking that there is something wrong with her or that it is someone playing tricks
one evening as angel is getting ready for bed she takes off her clothes and moves to the bed when she is startled and almost screams
there is a lump in her bed a lump shaped like a body
recovering she starts to scold her sister for scaring her and turns back the covers to discover that there is nothing there
she turns to her sisters bed across the room
she is fast asleep
the usual bluish of the household lights turn different colors and hues both day and night
sometimes not enough to cause any more than squinting or rubbing of the viewing partys eyes
steve and nora prepare to leave for a dinner with their friends
they have called a babysitter because the older children are going to a movie
as steven is shaving the th century music album is turned on full volume
this startles him and causes him to cut himself
he storms out of the bedroom goes to the stereo takes off the album and breaks it
he then yells for angel and reprimands her for turning it on so loud
she hasnt done it
the other children deny it also
steven accuses one of them of lying
record players dont just turn themselves on you know
angel upset with her father for breaking her album and for accusing her unjustly goes to her room upset
she has to prepare for her date
she sits at her vanity looking at herself and being angry with her father
she starts to put on lipstick
looking into the mirror she is putting her lipstick on someone elses face
this brings her image back to the mirror
she is frightened to look into mirrors from this point on
anxious to get out of the house angel hurries her older brother with whom she and several other friends are going to the movies out of the house
the babysitter a year old teenager arrives allowing nora and steven to be on their way
as she puts the children to bed they talk her into telling them a story
she concedes and tells them a ghost story
as she tells her story actual events in the house upstage the fictional story she is telling them adding to and punctuating the higher points
terrified the babysitter negligent of her duties runs screaming from the house into the night
neighbors lights go on obviously disturbed by the screaming
the older children get home to find the little ones sitting together on the steps no babysitter in sight
the parents return to a story of a deserting babysitter who says their house is haunted
the evenings events have everyone on edge especially steven and nora
nora sits at her vanity brushing out her long auburn tresses
as she brushes her hair somewhat mindlessly past her right shoulder an invisible wind lifts her hair out from her brush and her hand
it arches her hair slowly over her head and lays it to rest on her left shoulder
she sits frozen unable to speak the empty brush in her hand her wide eyes locked on her image in the mirror
at that moment she feels something touching her cheek
we see two indentations such as fingers would make as her cheek gently caves in opening her lips and her face is tilted upward by an invisible hand
she then receives a ghost kiss a long forced passionate kiss from which she cannot free herself
as she is released there is a noise from the living dining area
steven bolts from their bathroom sees the wide eyed almost panicked expression on his wifes face
he grabs her hand and together they walk down the hall to check the house
the furniture in the dining room has been totally rearranged
the chairs are on top of the furniture
some of the furniture has been moved from room to room
they wake the children pack lightly pick up the dog and leave to spend the night at the local holiday inn
they will stay there for the evening then move into noras sisters house within a day or so
the next day unable to work because of the events of his home life and not knowing what to do he calls the parapsychological organization within the university of chicago
they all decide that the best idea for the freelings is to spend another night at the hotel while some of their experts spend an evening at their home with
that evening in the hotel room feeling things are getting better nora and steven make love
however something happens
a spirit enters stevens body causing his personality and actions to be altered a bit
he does and says things to her that are obviously not of his doing
things which nora would find baroque to say the least
his manner of love making is altered but rather than nora being turned off she is somehow excited by this change
what in essence is happening is that she is making love to two men at the same time
steven and another spirit
some of the things which he says harp back to an old time long long ago
the next morning at breakfast things are a bit strained
a normal breakfast conversation is changed into a frightening experience when the six year old carol ann is talking about what she is going to do at school when all
of a sudden for no more than three or four words her voice changes slips two octaves and a mans voice continues telling the story in the childs own words but only for a few seconds before the young girls voice returns
the whole family stops eating and stares
it is obvious that the child is not aware of what has just occurred
nora gets up
puts her hand over her mouth stares at steven with a realization of the night before and runs back up to their room
they come to grips with the fact that it might not be the house but themselves that are haunted
the desire for familiar surroundings and the realization that no ones been hurt causes them to go back home
on arriving home they realize that their house has been invaded by an entourage of young long haired parapsychologists
between their visit and the horrifying experience of the babysitter the entire neighborhood realizes that something terrible is happening in their neighborhood
also taking place at this time is a major archeological dig
this is going on not from from the freelings home perhaps instead of a dig it should be just the building of some new homes in a tract nearby
the excavators discover bones
thousands of them
it is discovered that what has been unearthed is an extremely large grave site
the results of a massive massacre of white settlers perhaps years ago
the bones had been shoveled into shallow graves in approximately a acre perimeter
children babies pioneer men and their women
arrow heads scalping knives a horrible way to die
this discovery along with the disclosure of the events at the freeling household cause experts to hypothesize that perhaps through a rift in the barrier between now and then and
through one of the members of the freeling family as a mortal host the spirits have found a gateway into the s and american suburbia
some hypothesize that they are looking for help to the next world the world that they belong in and the world that has been denied them
the freelings are instantly descended upon by professional pseudo professional and crack pot ghost hunters who all want to spend an evening in the house with the ghosts and their
new fangled equipment for recording spirits on film and tape
a psychologist informs the family that perhaps the spirits are attracted to one member of the family and that a battery of tests could be run to determine who it
not wanting to place any kind of blame or ostracization upon any member of the family they refuse the testing
besides what would they do with the guilty party
as the freelings and their house become unwitting celebrities the children are saddled with a barrage of torment from schoolmates
they are avoided
they are the haunted people
one of the people who comes to help the freelings is tagina barrins a psychic and regular contributor to the national enquirer
she is a comic character who though she comes off as a crazy old lady seeking attention is probably the most helpful and authentic psychic of them all
she spends a lot of time just walking around talking to the house
at one point tagina is awakened in the dead of night and in a somnambulistic state drives to the freelings home is admitted by our unseen visitors and walks into
nora and stevens bedroom
they wake with a start finding her talking to the television set static
the freelings neighbors once very friendly have been almost hostile
a petition has been started by the eisenhowers to force them to leave the neighborhood
it is what steven and his family want more than anything
they look for a home in the area in which steven works but are informed by his boss that if they think about bringing their bizarre ghostly rumors and cultist
rituals to his acres of suburban tranquility he will be fired and will never work in real estate again
within a short period of time the freeling neighbors have problems of their own
screams and panic indicate that like a contagious virus the haunting has spread first to the eisenhower home then across the street to other neighbors then down the block
beyond causing frightened residents to harm themselves while fleeing ghostly manifestations ghost fires are set
a ghost fire is a phenomenon which can take place in any room of a house
perhaps in the cold center of the haunting in that home
the fire will devastate everything in a specific area but will not spread to other rooms or other floors
each haunting in each home is signaled by the television
where there is a remote control device the tv will flip on by itself in the early hours of the morning to a station that is broadcasting static noise
the manifestations originate there
other items for possible incorporation would be the manifestations love to materialize not in humanoid form such as ghosts and occasionally we will see ectoplasmic displays perhaps emanating from the
toaster in the house
ectoplasm is a spermatozoa like substance that originates often from the fingers of mediums trying to contact spirits from the other side
but yet these ectoplasm manifestations could come from the family toaster or from the microwave oven or from anything naturally uncommon
occasionally there is a manifestation of a whisp like type of smoke in basic humanoid form that keeps changing shape and travels from one room to the next until if
finds the recipient is has been looking for
when found the smoke will dissipate into the sleeping person
we will see their hair blow from their ear as if a ghostly breath is whispering something privately and chillingly
we might even hear mournful crying of help me help me from perhaps a poltergeist
beyond the toaster and the microwave oven the ectoplasmic manifestations will finally develop first and foremost from the television sets that are on during static hours as if a form
is trying to climb out of the tv set and into your home to haunt you
this could be the climax of the story
another aspect of the dogs being affected by the haunting could be for the family to see it roll over on its back as if it is being tickled on
the tummy and without anything obviously petting it he wags his right leg the common reaction of most dogs when being tickled above the abdomen
one possible ending for night time could be the evacuation of the town by the townspeople
as we slowly pan through the empty town and its deserted homes we see ghost fires being lit
the town burns tv sets imploding the burial ground has not been consecrated and the souls are set to rest in peace
addition to treatment dated july a petition has been started by the eisenhowers to force the freelings to move from the neighborhood
following various threatening telephone calls throughout dinner steven angrily calls the police and asks for someone to come out and investigate the situation
a call from the freeling home or other families on this community suburb protesting unusual occurrences
a policeman arrives approximately pm
he asks steven and his family questions about recent threats etc
and then falls into a serious discussion about the freelings moving from the neighborhood all together
at least consider a temporary move
growing hostility has been evident through periodic vandalism
several windows over the last week with broken windows in their house and automobile along with other assorted mischief
steven loses his temper at one point during their conversation and questions whether the local police department has really made a concerted effort to do anything to protect his family
let alone control this mounting violence
as the conversation heightens almost to hysteria an iron comes hurling through the living room plate glass window followed by the loud chanting of an angry mob outside free us
from the freelings
steven grabs the police man and screams what are you going to do about that
pointing hysterically out the window
flustered the policeman frees himself from stevens grasp and takes control by ordering nora and the children into the living room on the floor out of the way of the
things settle for a bit and the policeman and steven move toward the front door
he reaches over to pull it open gun drawn he jumps back just as a frying pan flies by catching the corner of the door jamb
out of sight but with the door still ajar the policeman yells orders for the crowd to disperse
footsteps and scurrying can now be heard on the roof nora attempting to calm the children
lightheartedly on the surface she heads to the kitchen to get the children some milk and cookies
its obvious the crowd laden with guns frying pans kitchen knives crow bars etc
are paying little attention to the policemans demands
he reaches over to shut the door the chanting continues several octaves higher now
as the door slams he yells to steven to get on the phone for some backup units
as he says this a huge gush of water pours out of the fireplace sending a cloud of ashes and soot into the living room
the children jump up running and screaming
nora in the kitchen sends a glass pitcher crashing to the floor she screams and runs to the living room
steven angry and frightened grabs the phone to call for reinforcements but the phone lines have been cut and the phone is dead
nora and the children begin bolting the doors and windows frantically
the chanting outside continues
the youngest of the freelings carol ann silently sobs in the corner of the couch holding snugly to a white stuffed bunny rabbit
in the midst of the terror she suddenly stands and makes her way toward the window a very content look on her face as she gazes outside at the angry
her bunny drops and dangles from her hand as she slowly looks toward the sky
slowly at first then like locusts real rocks begin descending from the sky pummeling the mob
people begin screaming and running in all directions
slowly various members of the family stop what theyre doing and move toward the living room window
within a few minutes the yard is cleared of people and rocks cover what was a lawn
the family relieved but uncomfortable stare silently at carol ann who softly giggles and caresses her bunny off in a world of her own
its night time story by steven spielberg
amendments august august it further concerns the epidemic spread through the suburban neighborhood of this malevolent haunting
the carrier is the youngest daughter carol ann
wherever she goes it follows
the film aims to trace the mental disintegration of this american nuclear family unit as well as the psychological effects on an entire community that ultimately sets off a vigil
anti action against the freeling family
august nora is feeling very uneasy and tired from little sleep during the night
steven has headed off for work and the children except for carol ann are all off to school
jim and joannie bender live next door and are really the only close neighborhood friends the freelings have
when the housing tract was announced they were the first two families on the list after camping out in line for almost a week
a feat nora now tends to regret
she telephones joannie and asks if shed like to come by for a morning cup of coffee
joannie indicates that its a pretty busy time for her but before she finishes nora cuts in edging on hysteria almost begging
a little alarmed joannie quickly agrees and the freeling doorbell is ringing within minutes
nora straining to be relaxed gives her a big hug and talking a mile a minute heads for the kitchen with joannie in tow
certain things in the house are still disheveled from all the activity during the night
joannie takes notice of this as she follows nora to the kitchen
a concerned look crosses her face as she knows nora is a meticulous house keeper
nora hands joannie a cup of coffee and blurts out almost in tears joannie could steve and the kids stay with you and jim tonight
joannie immediately assumes that nora and steven are separating hence the frantic call
nora immediately straightens that out but still avoids any discussion about ghosts
she reveals that they believe there have been burglars in the area and theyre all feeling a bit uncomfortable staying there knowing they havent been caught
without hesitation from joannie everything is arranged
steven arrives home after picking up the kids and finds nora and carol ann patiently waiting in the living room with bags packed
she then announces she has made arrangements with joannie and jim for the family to spend the night at their house
steven gets slightly irritated feelinng that nora is over reacting but quickly agrees to have dinner but not necessarily spend the night
all the kids are delighted because the bender children are close in age and they look forward to one big party
following dinner lawrence suggests a game of charades
nora and joannie are in agreement but set the bed time hour at pm
after a mass flurry of stacking dishes and clearing the table all the kids head to the living room leaving the adults with coffee in the dining room
the kids choose sides and begin acting out various movie idols etc
were aware of the adults engaged in a loud political discussion and kids screaming clues guesses etc
we then focus our attention to angel freeling as she begins giving her clues
a couple of periodic wisecracks from her brother sweeny and then out of nowhere angel freezes and glares into the fireplace with an absolutely horrified expression on her face
the laughter from the children stops instantly and we visibly see two of the children shudder and slowly turn and look in the direction angel is staring
the fire wavers slightly as if there was a breeze
then from upstairs in the bedroom the th century music album can be heard full blast as angel screams and throws her arms back outstretched and fighting as if being
tired to a stake
her face contorts in agony
she throws her head back and forth violently
all the children in the living room are stunned and just stare mesmerized
angel cries out several times no more fire
no more fire
the violent jerking subsides for a moment as her eyes rise still a horrific look on her face her hair slowly rises as if someone has hold of it and
is going to scalp her
again she screams violently and her head drops limply in front of her
her arms are still outstretched but shes become more resolved to the pain now almost unconscious
we are aware that is has become a freezing temperature inside the room frost has gathered on the windows even though it is the middle of july outside
we then become aware of very faint imprints of faces in the windows
then writing starts to appear on the filmy condensation like finger painting
all the screaming has brought steven and jim into the living room
steven enters with an angry tone what the hell
his voice trails off as he sees sweeny huddled in the middle of the floor rocking angel trying to comfort and calm her
the other children with teeth chattering still stare as if in shock
steven and jims arrival breaks the silence
carol ann jumps up and runs hysterically to her father
steven scoops her into his arms at the same time that one of the bender children becomes aware of the faces in the windows she screams which sets off a
chain of reaction screaming
then as quickly as it happened it ends
the blaring music stops the frost runs off the windows
all the children are obviously shook
joannie and nora run in with a flurry of questions
none of which has an audible answer from the children
nora looks at steven they realize the ghosts have followed them
everyone has gathered with the kids in the kitchen to have warm milk and cookies to calm everyones nerves
angel is back to normal with little sign of her ordeal
all the kids decide theyll sleep in the living room except for the two youngest
nora and joannie are in fair agreement to this as they head up the stairs with the little ones
the other kids get the sleeping bags out and start rearranging the furniture for space
lawrence freeling is really impressed with the benders new advent tv screen
johnny bender runs through the remote control with him and they loudly discuss how great the football games can be seen and they cant wait for the season to start
soon things settle down the kids are set and the grown ups head upstairs
half way up nora says ok everyone quiet its way past bed time lights out no talking and no watching television
after the good nights and the periodic giggling subsides the room gets very quiet except for the usual night time creaks
about minutes go by and we hear lawrence psst
johnny are you awake
theres a moaning sound then yeah
whatd ya want
lawrence what time is it
johnny looks over at the big grandfather clock on the far wall
its in the morning
why are you still awake
lawrence ignores the question and says how do you turn on the tv
and make sure theres no sound
johnny whispering youre nuts go to sleep theres nothing on at this hour
lawrence wanna bet
weve got to get it just as it signs off
johnny you mean to tell me you like to sit and watch the snow or something
lawrence something like that youll see
reluctantly johnny craws out of his sleeping bag and over to the set flips it on just in time to see the jets go by on the sign off
lawrence great perfect timing
johnny dont you think theres been enough weird shit tonight
lawrence oh come on be a sport just watch
the two boys crawl back into their sleeping bags and with their chins resting on folded arms they stare in great anticipation at the advent screen and the mass of
shortly we see both of the boys drift off to sleep trying as hard as they can to fight staying awake with no luck
just as they drift off the images that began to appear in the freeling home begin to slowly take shape at the benders
its am the grandfather clock chimes on deaf ears
august carol anne and her best friend jeanette are playing house upstairs in carol anns bedroom
they have dressed up in various old clothes of noras and some of her jewerly and hats
tea has been served though a minature little tea set which carol ann has obviously used often with all the chips and cracks etc
both girls are talking a mile a minute to their dolls
although this is make believe like any little girls six years old theyre playing very seriously
carol ann wear an old hat of her mothers
on the left side holding up the netting is an antique stick pin which nora found at one of the local antique shops
the hat is obviously too big for carol annand as she bends down to serve her doll some tea the hat tumbles off onto the table
jeanette giggles grabs the hat and puts it on her doll
carol anne at that point becomes very serious rises from the table and moves over to the record player
she then puts on the th century record at exactly this moment jeanette begins gazing at the stick pin in the hat and in slow motion she reaches outand removes
it from the hat
carol ann standing sternly and motionless by the record player in the background
in the foreground jeanette takes the pin as if it were a buck knife and drives it slowly into the chest of her doll
she then removes her hand leaving the pin embedded
at the head of th epin we reveal a carving of an indian fire god something to be established earlier in the story possibly
then instantly carol ann reels around confronts jeanette and begins speaking like an adult or perhaps in an indian language all signs of being six years old are gone except
for her physical appearance
then looking straight at jeanette says she must die
jeanette turns from carol ann pulls this pin from the chest of the doll and with ferocity drives the pin into the chest a second time
carol ann still gazing in a trance looks at jeanette then the doll and the doll burts into flames
jeanette as if snapping out of a dream jumps back startled and runs for the door
the door then bursts into flames
jeanette terribly frightened now begins to scream and cry
the door and the doll blazing away brings nora frantically up the stairs
carol ann up to this point has not moved
at the sound of her mothers voice she returns to he rnormal voice mommy mommy make the fire stop
by now the neighbors have called the fire department
fire trucks roar up to the house and a ladder is quickly thrust up to the nd floor bringing the girls to saftey
as the fireman descends he says under his breath oddest thing only burned a doll and a door didnt spread to any other part of the house
damnest thing i ever saw
august toward the end of the picture we should reveal that carol ann is beginning to get to nora
nora has already felt trapped over the past few years
she married at a very young age
shes bright and enthusiastic and has begun to voice her discontent to steven
its obvious that carol ann was not a planned baby as noted by the ages of the other children
nora is sound asleep its her first night alone in their new house
steven is on a three day business trip
even with the kids and the dog nora has always been a bit nervous without him there
carol ann comes in after nora has finally drifted off to sleep
she stands quietly by the bed then softly at first mommy pause
nora wakes up
groggily what is it honey
carol ann i got somethin to tell you
nora what honey
carol ann i got somethin to say
nora getting a little irritated then say it honey i want to go back to sleep
carol ann can i get up on the bed to say it
she pats the side of the bed now what is it you have to tell me
carol ann climbs up and looking straight into her mothers face but with a distant stare she says its night time its night time
nora is visibly unnerved and then windows above noras bed fly open she screams
sweeny comes running into the room
nora slightly embarrassed but obviously feeling very distant to carol ann
its nothing she says carol ann just startled me thats all
sweeny not quite sure what to make of the situation leads carol ann out of the bedroom
he looks in the door after hes tucked carol ann in at his mother smiles and says you gonna be alright
nora still a little unsettled just fine see you in the morning
just the jitters with your dad gone
the next day nora tries to observe carol ann from a distance
too many unexplained things have been happening and nora is beginning to doubt her own children
while doing relatively routine chores a thought comes to mind
she goes to the phone and calls information for a locksmith
would it be possible to install a lock on a bedroom door today
oh thank you
she hangs up
a look of relief crosses her face
the next page is missing sweeny has fallen asleep in the rocking chair next to the bed
a thoughtful look crosses her noras face as she grabs her robe and heads for the door
a huge back hoe can be seen past the gentleman at the door
weve come to start diggin the pool area maam
nora with a slight look of embarrassment oh im so sorry i completely forgot it was saturday i ll show you around to the back yard
the door closes
as she comes back in the rest of the family has come to life the record player is already full blast up stairs carol ann transfixed herself in front of
saturday morning cartoons
nora exits the kitchen where angel has already started breakfast
hi mom i didnt know they were going to start digging the swimming pool today
nora i totally forgot
i even forgot what day it was
god i wish your father would come home
angel i cant wait for a pool
she can tell that nora isnt really listening her head buried in the refrigerator
angle while turning the bacon mom what happened last night
i heard screaming
sweeny said youd had a nightmare
it must have been terrible
do you remember any of it
as she is saying this with her head still buried in the refrigerator carol ann wanders in bunny in tow and slides unnoticed under noras arm to peer in the
nora goes to close the refrigerator catches a glimpse of carol ann and lets out a blood curdling scream
carol ann obviously frightened drops to the floor and bursts into tears
angel at this point also screams and sends the spatula and bacon grease flying everywhere
nora more embarrassed than anything bends down to comfort carol ann she looks up at angel
a big grin spreads across her face and they burst into hysterics
nora i guess im still a little shook from last night
later that afternoon nerves still a little frazzled nora mentions to sweeny that it might not be a bad idea for him to take the other kids to a movie
sweeny is not overly thrilled about the idea but also senses the urgency in his mothers voice
he agrees and they all head off that evening to see fantasia at the local theater leaving nora and elmer home for a quiet evening
nora is obviously relieved
she settles into a good book and a warm fire and were aware that it has begun to rain
she calls steven and gives him a run down on the events of the day but doesnt mention the series of events with carol ann
they discuss the new pool nora with all this rain i hope we dont end up with too much mud for the cement to set in
when are you due home
i really miss you
you know i hate staying in this house when youre not here
we hear him mumble a response
nora i know the kids are here and elmers right here keeping me company but its not the same
they both say goodbye at the same time a deafening clap of thunder goes off startling nora
its now pouring rain
nora flips on the television for some company and heads to the kitchen for a cup of tea
then elmer begins to act very strange
he sits staring at the wall as hes been known to do on occasion
at this point though it makes nora nervous
she calls his name several times with no reaction
he then suddenly bolts for the backdoor
she follows him and looks out into the pouring rain
she tries the outside light but the bulb is burned out
leaving the door slightly ajar she grabs her tea and heads for the living room
very shortly afterward she doses off
she wakes with a jerking motion
she sits up some sitcom is blaring away with canned laughter we still hear the pouring rain she looks at her watch the kids will come home in an hour
nora rises to stretch and suddenly out of nowhere the th century record album begins blaring away from carol anns and angels room
noticeably disturbed and turning lights on as she goes nora heads upstairs to check
as she slowly enters the bedroom the arm of the stereo ejects over to the side and the stereo shuts itself off
nora nervously cases the room
satisfied that it was nothing overly unusual as the girls have left the stereo on before she heads for her bedroom and gets ready for bed
she stares at herself in the bathroom mirror
slowly she reaches up and touches the dark circles that have begun to appear under her eyes she then pulls slightly at the corners as if remembering what it was
like without the little wrinkles that now appear there
then she opens the cabinet pulls out the jar of cold cream and begins slowly removing the makeup from her eyes and face staring lethargically in the mirror
the tap water goes on and she begins rinsing her face with several handfuls of water
as the splashing continues we see at the far left corner of the mirror a very small trickle of blood begin to spread in very fine lines along the natural
ridges in the glass of the mirror
her face covered with water she swings around with her eyes closed to grab a towel
dries her face and reaches over to turn on the facets in the bathtub
still not noticing the trickling blood on the mirror she reaches underneath the sink for her favorite bubble bath
she then climbs in the tub pours plenty in for lots of bubbles
she then adjusts the force of water from the taps settles back eyes closed and totally relaxed
as the bubbles begin to rise in the tub and for the first time in our frame we see that they are pink in color
nora eyes still closed sees nothing
moments later we hear elmer barking up a storm
this rouses nora
she opens her eyes sees blood now pouring from the faucet instead of water screams and flies out of the bath
as she grabs a towel she sees the mirror hysterical she runs to the bedroom and grabs her bathrobe
by now elmer is not only barking but whining as if hurt
nora goes tearing downstairs out the back door yelling elmer elmer
its raining so hard that nora is soaked within seconds
she hesitates for a moment and almost heads back inside but elmer cries again and she strains to make out his shape in the distance
its pitch black as she edges her way out onto the patio
suddenly the ground gives way and she plunges into the freshly dug pit for the new swimming pool
she attempts to grab the side but the freshly tilled soil is now thick and gooey muck
nora sinks quickly up to her waist in the quick sand like mud
she sees one of the pool lights hanging by a wire and struggling tries to grab it
it has now begun to rain even harder and panic is definitely beginning to set in with nora
desperately she grabs at the light wire catches it and pulls as hard as she can
at that moment a wagon wheel comes tumbling through the mud along with a sea of skeletons and mummies
one after the other she tries to push off them off of her as they bob up and down out of the thick gooey mud falling in all directions
many of the skeletons have severed limbs old bullet holes through the chest and head
nora is beyond the terror that allows you to scream and is consumed with panic
a bolt of lightning strikes very close to the pool area and suddenly all the pool lights just hanging by wires no covers go on illuminating this sea of decay
nora finally gets out a loud scream which dissolves into sobs
we the kids coming out of the theater
carol ann is sound asleep in sweenys arms
lawrence is beside himself about the film
as they make their way back to the house we hear bits and pieces being reenacted by lawrence
they all clamor inside the house whispering and giggling shh
dont wake mom
as a few houselights go on we are faintly aware of streaked mud on the carpet and hand prints on the wall
the children stare stunned and frightened
sweeny directs everyone into the living room
carol ann who remains sound asleep he stretches out on the sofa
he motions to lawrence and angel to stay with carol ann
he then makes his way up the stairs following the trail of mud along the banister hand smudges on the wall mud covering the door knob and light switch into
dresser drawers are thrown open a bathrobe covered in mud is draped on the bed
sweeny then follows the trail into the bathroom
horrified by the bathtub full of blood he jumps back and turns to run out of the bathroom
he just catches a glimpse of the mirror as he smashes right into angel who had wandered up the stairs in search of sweeny they both scream
lawrence yells from down below
sweeny and angel grab each other sweeny shudders and angel begins to cry oh sweeny whats happened to mom
comforting as best he can he leads her down the stairs back to the living room
carol ann still sleeps soundly
sweeny moves over to the picture window and realizes noras car is gone
a bit relieved he turns back to angel
the car is gone
mom should be alright
we gotta call dad
he rushes to the phone and dials
steven answers the phone
sweeny with a slight loss of control in his voice now dad oh god dad youve gotta come home tonight
pause no moms gone
pause i dont know but there mud everywhere and blood he chokes a little bit its awful and we cant go to the neighbors they all think were possessed
long pause while steven talks sweeny ok dad yeah theyre all fine were in the living room carol ann is sleeping pause
sweeny hangs up the phone and looks into lawrence and angels frightened faces hes on his way
everythings going to be ok
dad said about an hour and a half hell try to call the police but im sure they wont come
under his breath they never believe us anyway
nora driving in a transfixed stare headlights lighting her face from ongoing cars
we see that her hair is caked with mud along with her arms and face
she pulls into a motel about miles outside of town checks in and immediately goes to call steven
theres no answer
she dials again still no answer
she looks at her watch its pm
frustrated she grabs her bag and heads across the street to a little local dive cafe called indian palms
she fumbles around with the menu
nothing looks very good the page flips back revealing a historical overview of indian history in the area with a map and pictures from the early s
nora barely pays attention to what shes looking at until she sees a small picture of a ghastly massacre an artists conception of the actual event
she continues reading and realizes that the massacre took place at the exact location of their sub division
she stuffs the menu in her purse and peels out of the parking area back toward town
we cut to the children at the house
all the younger children have dosed off sweeny lies wide awake cocking his head at every sound
finally he gets up and walks into the kitchen
he opens the refrigerator and the light from inside spills onto the floor in front of him
the storm front seems to be moving on and the pounding rain has turned into a howling wind
he reaches in to grab some milk just as the wind gusts through the back door then slams it shut causing sweeny to jump and drop the cartoon of milk
sweeny moves toward the back door tries the light switch nothing happens
he slowly opens the door elmer hey boy
where are you
he then sees pool lights or rather an eerie glow emanating from the freshly dug hole in the back yard
as he steps out onto the patio cautiously moving toward the illuminated pit he gets within a few feet and a skeletal head emerges slowly over the edge
horrified sweeny loses his balance and falls backward into the mud along the edge
he quickly scrambles to his feet sliding across the patio and into the house never looks back
he then slams the door shut and locks it
he runs to the living room
he sees carol ann sitting up her back to him
all we hear is a humming lullaby
he moves around to the front of her
she doesnt look at him only stares out the window singing to her bunny its night time its night time
still panicked he wakes the other two kids cmon we gotta go
he looks at carol ann hesitant at first you too lets go
he reaches out to grab her hand
she looks at him sternly and says no
sweeny stares for just an instant and then reaches over to pick her up
angel steps in and says here carol ann ill hold your bunny
carol ann turns to both of them and in a low rumbling male voice says no then pulls the head off her bunny stuffing flying everywhere
from carol anns pov looking at the shocked faces of sweeny and angel we see a ghost fire burst into flames in the neighbors house and jim and joannie bender
come running out into the street
then headlights come through the living room window playing across the wall and over to carol anns face
sweeny angel and lawrence turn to run toward the door and it too bursts into flame just as we hear stevens voice from outside the door sweeny are you in
sweeny terrified dad weve got to get out of here
shell burn the place down
his voice trails off as we hear a chair come crashing through the picture window
quickly steve helps all the kids outside
he yells for carol ann sweeny grabs his arm no
she should stay
steven looks at sweeny dumbfounded
just then nora drives up and comes running to the four of them
steven starts to go in after carol anne sweeny practically tackles him no dad please
nora rushes over oh god believe him hes right
she buries her head in his chest
we look up and see carol ann get up and walk slowly still humming toward the back door and out into the yard moving toward the pit
steven and nora grab the kids and head for the car
we then realize that ghost fires have started throughout the neighborhood even in those houses that have not yet completed construction
people are running with few belongings to their cars some screams and crying can be heard
we pan past a no trespassing sign and reveal a huge digging site in progress
to end similar to the birds with no real answer in sight
its night time final set of revisions these final revisions to the treatment dated august change the white settlers killed by indians buried under the neighborhood to simply a regular
grave yard that stevens company decided to build on top of
it also amps up the danger to nora in the scene where she is attacked by the ghost in her bedroom before running outside and falling into the newly dug
finally it adds an early scene showing the changing of the tv set channels by unseen forces and also renames lawrence to robbie
august steven freeling comes from a family of real estate brokers
his father was selling houses when they were going for a thousand to five thousand dollars
both of his brothers are still in business with their dad and steven went out on his own
his reputation locally is one of the best
he now heads up a huge firm responsible for the last five or six major land development in the area
the newest being a housing development designed to handle at least people
ground was broken on the area little over two years ago and families started to move in about months ago
steven is in charge of showing the houses clearing escrow arrangements for personal kitchen designs etc
approximately all the houses have been filled it sits in the middle of several other housing development and is separated by rows of poplar trees
a grave yard had stood here for years which accounts for the delay in developing the area
through a lot of underhanded payoff with the planning commission etc
stevens company had gotten the ok to build provided they moved the graves to another location
realizing this would be wildly expensive they had publicized transferring the grave yard when in fact they simply moved the grave stones to another location but covered the existing grave
site with about seven feet of fill and about a foot of dirt quickly got the foundations laid and before anyone really knew what happened installed housing tract
steven was never involved in the negotiations but served as a representative in the community for the company therefore becoming a target for the ghosts retaliation
this sequence will begin with nora combing her hair at the vanity however no one else is home steven is on a business trip and the kids have gone to
the movies to give nora a little peace and quiet
fairly deep in thought nora combs through her hair in long slow strokes
then without warning the brush lifts her hair from one side of her head and lays it down on the other
nora stares in a state of shock
indentations from fingers can then be seen as if a hand is grabbing her face and turning
nora is still in a state of shock unable to move
we then see her lips press in her nose shift off to the side a bit and we realize she is being kissed by a ghost
the indentations leave her face and she sits shocked for a few minutes
then in the mirror she sees a human form take shape from a smoke and gaseous material
nora slowly rises from her chair and begins to move toward the door
staring at the smoke like shape which is now dissipating she reaches up to turn on the bedroom light
just as she switches it on it immediately goes off
quickly she turns it on again and again something switches it off
she gasps a little and turns to run down the hall and the stairs to the living room turning lights on as she goes but they go off as quickly
as she turns them on
she then turns on the television set which immediately goes off
she runs for the phone which is invisibly taken out of her hand and hung up
truly frightened she runs upstairs again half way up the stairs as if someone stepped on the back of her dress she falls
we then see a hand print as if something were gripping her ankle and it begins moving up her leg
nora stares for a moment in horror and then begins to resist trying to pull herself up the stairs reaching desperately for the banister
as she breaks free she runs into the bedroom the door slams shut moments later and the smokey gaseous form begins to appear again
we can only see it with the moonlight streaming through the window
nora sits shivering on the corner of the bed with her hands crossed over her chest holding onto her shoulders
were then aware of the hand indentations again which grab her wrists and slowly but forcefully uncross her arms and drop them to her side
nora under her breath on the verge of tears says no no please dont hurt me
as she says this her night gown is slowly ripped off her shoulders and she is pushed down on the bed
we then see the hand indentations grasp her breast with a strong massaging effect and move down to her underwear which is gradually slipped back on the bed
not able to grab at any human form she takes hold of the sheets for leverage to try and get out of the ghosts grasp
in the struggle she rolls off the bed but were aware that she still cant get up
her arms are suddenly thrown back straight over the top of her head and then her legs are pulled apart forcefully we can see on noras face sheer terror beyond
the ability to cry
then the sheet over the top of them begins to rise up and down rhythmically and several times we see her face being kissed
then the sheet falls away from her as if someone rolled over and took the sheet with them
nora for an instant stares at the sheet then jumps up and runs for the door grabbing her robe on the way out
she gets downstairs grabs her purse and heads for the front door
she takes hold of the handle and finds that she cant turn it
she pulls frantically to no avail
she then runs for the back door quickly switches on the outside light and runs out on the patio
finding it difficult to see she runs into the patio table and knocks a chair over just as the outside light goes off
now truly horrified she starts backing out onto the lawn
a clap of thunder goes off startling her she turns and steps right into the freshly dug pit for the new swimming pool
another clap of thunder a bolt of lightning and a huge downpour starts
the freshly tilled soil turns into a gooey quick sand like mud very quickly
one end of the pool is very steep and as nora tries desperately to climb out the grade is so steep she slides back each time
after the second or third slide the mud is now up around her waist another clap of thunder and suddenly the pool lights come on
nora looks around for a moment and suddenly we see areas in the mud that start to rise up and then shafts of mud as the pouring rain hits these
we realize they are skeletons more and more bobbing to the surface then again a bolt of lightening strikes and short circuits the pool lights causing a strobe effect
in sheer terror eyes shut nora begins screaming clawing frantically trying to make her way to the shallow end of the pool
just as she nears the edge a hand reaches out to help her
with one hand resting on the pools edge and the other in this hand she looks up into the eyes of her ghost a smoke like apparition
for the first time we can make out a human like face
nora screams and goes sliding down back into the sea of skeletons only to come face to face with the corpse of the ghost she just saw
the last image we see is nora huddled in the corner of the pool strobe lights going and a sea of bobbing skeletons rain pouring down and occasional lightening and
another revision page dated august steven sits in the living room one evening after a hard days work watching monday night football with his two boys sweeny and robbie change
name from lawrence in previous treatment
just as the touchdown pass is thrown the television goes to snow
steven jumps up furious and starts screaming at the neighbors
he runs over to jim benders house who is also furious and finds that he thinks that stevens remote control changed the channel on his set
they argue fervently for a few minutes and steven heads back to the house convinced now that he will just move the tv somewhere else in the house as to
avoid the neighbors remote control
during the night the television set clicks on and starts racing through the channels till it comes to snow
this wakes steven with a start
he jumps out of bed throws on a robe and races over to the neighbors house
after pounding on the door jim bender answers
steven immediately flies off the handle accusing him of disrupting the household
jim seems a bit flustered saying he was just about to head over to his house because his set went on voluntarily
steven sees this as just an excuse but concedes
this remote control duel continues for a few days until one evening while the family is watching a late movie the channels begin racing around until they come to snow
steven jumps up and races outside over to their neighbors house
peeking through the window he realizes they are gone
he tries the door several times and walks around to the back of the house
he finds this a bit disquieting and heads back to his house
as he turns his back we are aware that the tv set in the neighbors house clicks on just as we hear a scream from the freeling home
nora seems a little more unnerved as steven enters the house insisting that some form came out of the television set
steven passes this off as her imagination but doesnt let on that the neighbors werent home to cause the channel changing
thus begins the silent invasion of the freeling home through the static snow of their television sets
