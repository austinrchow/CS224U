written by carl dupre kirsty gooding looks out the passenger window as the trees go whizzing past
shes attractive late twenties warmly sophisticated
something makes her smile
she turns to the driver and thinks real hard as she says this
cubic root of nine thousand two hundred and sixty one
trevor is her husband late twenties as well
god gave him brains and beauty
he has used them both prodigiously
why do we have to do this now kirsty
shut up and play darling
five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four
kirsty takes a calculator out of her purse and double checks the math
okay pull over
looking at his watch but
laughing if what ive heard is true this could be the last time for a long long time
besides weve got a whole seven minutes before the next one
trevor waits a moment to see if shes kidding
through clenched teeth
then pulls over to the side of the road
kirsty reaches over quickly unzips his pants immediately goes down on trevor out of frame
he reacts accordingly
a little pleasure utter shock
from below frame honey whats wrong
kirsty rises into frame once again
what isnt wrong
why are you doing this anyway
self conscious im
im doing a very special thing here
and you cant even
sorry honey the present situation isnt exactly fodder for an erection
shouldnt we be getting to the hospital
full on kirsty
for the first time we see her big pregnant belly sticking out
she looks at trevor innocently
i was going to keep breathing you know
you think im an amateur or something
trevor stuffs himself back in his pants puts the car in gear and presses the accelerator
just concentrate on the task at hand please
listen to me
you should be giving me this lecture
youve been cheating on me havent you
yes i had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction
roughly two thirds of married men who cheat start during the eighth month of their wives first pregnancy
i would never cheat on you
not while youre pregnant now you know that
features tightening okay
uh oh here comes another one
share the pain kirsty
she takes trevors hand and squeezes as hard as she can
in a solved rubics cube sitting between them
do we need this vision of the solved rubics cube
the car is approaching a bridge
trevor takes his hand off the wheel to look at his watch
in dire pain oh god
trevor i think my water just broke
trevor grabs the wheel again
oh my god
its coming out
trevor looks at her trying to stay calm
okay kirsty dont panic
just keep breathing
put the seat back and hold on to something
were almost there
kristys hand moves down the along side the seat between the door and she plunges back with the seat
she looks at trevor wide eyed
shes about to give birth in a chevrolet
oh my god trevor
breathing heavily oh my god oh my god
trevor its coming out
this isnt happening
kristy starts to convulse with pain
she begins to tremble and her arms flail about in an attempt to ease her discomfort
she grabs trevors arm for support
honey take it easy
your gonna be alright
kristy becomes more violent kicking her legs up onto the dashboard
she starts grabbing trevors arm a little more violently causing trevors to weave a bit on the road as he recoils
the car lunges to the side of the road and weaves a bit in the gravel
up ahead a bridge approaches
trevor regains control of the car
trevor contd kristy
take it easy
everythings gonna be alright
comon start the breathing with me
one two three and blow
trevor starts the lamanns method alone as kristy appears to have passed out from the pain
she has her head leaned away from him and is limp in the passengers seat
trevor contd krist
kristy doesnt answer
trevors puts his arm on her and shakes her
she doesnt react
trevor contd kristy
honey wake up
trevors attention is now on his unconscious wife rather than the two lane road which stretches across the bridge
trevor contd honey wake up
please wake up
and with that kristys does exactly that
she lunges toward him in a violent spasm and scares the shit out of him and us which causes trevor to now completely lose control of the car
the rest is a blur
trevor loses control of the steering wheel
their car skids from one side of the bridge to the other careening toward the guardrail smash
the car is plummeting toward the river below
trevor and kirsty brace themselves
the car hits the surface
trevor flounders through a disoriented flurry of bubbles
he breaks the surface and gasps for air
getting his bearings he see the car bobbing on the surface the current is separating him from his wife
treading water he looks out at the car and there she is trapped inside
kirsty still belted to her seat
her eyes are wide with desperation breath quickening sinking fast
kristy pounds the window with her hands trying to get out
apparently giving in she presses a hand against the windshield just before the car disappears under the surface
trevor paddles hard to the shore
exhausted he crawls onto the shore underneath the bridge they just jumped
trevor stands trying to process what just happened in the last fifteen seconds
he screams out for his wife and to what has just happened
trevor drops to his knees in distress
trevor contd oh my god kristy
frantically im so sorry kristy
he hears something from above and looks up
a chunk of the bashed up guardrail from the bridge has just snapped off and is sailing right down toward him trevors eyes blink open darting left and right
he is on a bed his head bandaged
an angular nurse enters the room walking up to trevors bed
where is she
the nurse grabs trevors right arm and straps it to the side of the bed
she isnt exactly one of gods gentler creatures
hey what are you she moves to trevors legs strapping them down as well then his other arm
by now several surgeons enter the room features obscured by surgical masks
the nurse fastens a clamp around trevors head attaches it to the bed
trevor is completely discombobulated
the surgeons gather behind trevors bed
close on trevors face as he struggles to see whats happening back there but its useless
he cannot move a muscle
he hears a sickening sawing noise and his eyes bulge in horror
wide as the doctors calmly lift trevors freshly sawed cranium from his head exposing his brain
the chief surgeon a large unshaven man with magnifying lens alreaday in place make his eyes enormous and his face grotesquely distorted
he walks up presented with a tray full of evenly arranged pins
he cranks up the magnification of his lenes which make his eyes appear even larger
though no one speaks his name his name tag reads dr
what are you people doing
the chief surgeon takes one of the pins and gently pushes into a trevors frontal lobe
whats happening to
trevors eyes glaze over and his jaw relaxes
the chief surgeon speaks in an english accent
as you can see i just accessed the speech center temporarily shutting down all verbal ability
as the chief surgeon continues he takes several more pins off the tray
the goal is find the exact point in the brain where moral decisions are made the place where right and wrong is distinguished
in exploring this morality center i will most likely be triggering memories disrupting the unconscious
our patient may experience some distress during the proceedings but they are not due to pain
it is merely our patient recalling his past
chief surgeon slips another pin into trevors exposed brain
chief surgeon contd as he was thrown into the lake where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown
the chief surgeon voice lowers and his eyes turn black
the eye magification no at a hideous level showing jet black eyes
chief surgeon contd where you will be tormented day and night for ever and ever
trevor looks at the frowning nurse who is watching over him
chief surgeon sticks a needle into another spot on trevors brain
trevors pov the nurse is suddenly a pale gargoyle with blackened eyes
trevor opens his mouth to scream and in a burst of white light an angelic woman is now standing before him
she is bathed in a haze of white light
what do say trevor
his bindings are gone
the gargoyle nurse is gone
the surgeons are gone
and his brain is sitting safely within his inviolated skull upon which now sit a few electrodes
the bandage is no longer there
but from his pain wracked expression we know the pain in his head is still very real
he reaches for his head makes sure its all intact
where do i start
hows the old noggin
any change in the intensity
she touches him gently
angelic woman contd can you describe the pains
trevor looks up
the angelic woman smiles back at him
shes in scrubs a stethoscope dangling from her neck
im not sure
how about a jackhammer in the occipital lobe
she picks up a pad and scribbles something on it
trevor notices shes wearing a nameplate
are you a dream too
still hallucinating as well
what just happened to me anyway
it looked like a dream but it felt like reality
its the morphine trevor
youre on so much of it you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open
terevors quickly recalls the accident
fearing the worst
wheres my wife
confused your wife
an older doctor walks in
he gives trevor an icy look then looks at trevors chart
to ambrose still a little hazy
hes still in pain too even after the morphine
i recommend we admit him
at least for another day
leaning in sotto he just asked for his wife
well i cant find any abnormalities
i think were ready for discharge
ambrose looking up at trevor i think its time to ween you off these painkillers too
wouldnt want you to develop a dependency to them
you might do things like come to the hospital for no reason other than to get a fix wouldnt you
ambrose gives trevor a fatherly smile then exits not even looking at allison
allison watches him go then turns back to trevor
then smiles perkily
well looks like youre going home
hope you brought your bus pass
trevor starts nodding out
the bus is practically empty
two black children a boy and a girl sit across from trevor
a creepy old woman sits further back knitting something
a church bell ringing causes trevor to wake again up wincing at the sound
as the church passes the bell becomes louder and louder
trevor hears laughter and looks up at the children
the girl and her brother seem to be play fighting over a toy they hold between them
trevor looks at the toy getting stretched this way and that
do you kids mind keeping it down
the creepy old woman speaks up
aww let them be
theyre only kids
trevor notices what the old woman is knitting is a babys bootie
as the children continue to laugh at him trevor stares at the bootie tears welling up
trevor lives in a dingy place one step up from poverty level
funny thing is this used to be a nicer place
we see remnants of a feminine touch long since past
dirty dishes sit in the sink
a cockroach skitters across the kitchenette
trevor sits at his tv playing an extremely violent videogame
were talking heads getting blown off bodies exploding limbs being severed
as the end ends a demonic voice chuckles from the tv
the screen flashes try again
trevor takes a swig of beer and sits back in the easy chair looking at something atop the tv
a picture of kirsty
trevor looks through an old photo album
pictures of him and kirsty
some pictures of him
a lot of pictures of kirsty
smiles smiles smiles
he stops at one close up of them mugging at a camera theyve pointed on themselves
all we see is their faces the rest is dark and blurry except for one thing
a small shadowy object kirsty is holding
dressed in a button down shirt and tie trevor walks up to the pale utilitarian box like structure
it is a maze of cubicles iced by harsh fluorescence
it is a mill of data research where the tapping of fingers on computer keypads never ends
no thanks to trevor who has already resumed his head in hands position at his desk
he rubs his eyes seemingly blinded by the screen staring back at him
a man trevors age rolls up on his office chair beside trevor banging into the desk
trevors co worker and cubicle mate
trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today
christ my head feels like a split coconut
dude there is a track on the carpet between here and the bathroom
it was made by your ass
youve been dragging it all fucking week
what happened to you yesterday
bret eyes trevor suspiciously
bret contd you never came back after lunch
did you get a piece oass you bastard
give me a break
i checked back into the hospital amongst other things
you havent been to the hospital since uh
getting uncomfortable look never mind
just get some numbers going any numbers at all will due
the hills have eyes remember
bret casually gestures to a surveillance camera overhead that sweeps across the room like a prison spotlight
im just looking out for ya
bret slides back over to his work station
trevor puts his hands on the computer keys and starts to type
a jolt of pain rips through his cranium forcing him to stop
bret stops typing and breathes an exasperated sigh
sixty five point three percent of all headaches are due to low sugar levels in the bloodstream trevor
a light bulb seems to go off over trevors head
inside the narrow room blasted in fluorescent light trevor eyes a vending machine examining its wares
he peruses the sundry sugary snacks looking for just the right fix
its so quiet in here we can almost hear his head pounding in pain
he shuts his eyes
a couple of the fluorescent bulbs over his head wink out and the rest flicker weakly
when trevor opens his eyes again he notices the room has gotten considerably darker
he looks up at the weakening lights and grunts in disgust
the light is just dim enough now so that he cant see whats in the vending machine
he goes right up to the glass and peers into the machine using his hand as a visor
this strain on his eyes intensifies his headache
its still pretty murky inside the glass case
trevor squints and just when he thinks he can read a wrapper on
what is it
a candy bar
a pale hand suddenly presses against the glass from inside the machine
trevor jolts backwards
the hand is gone
but in the reflection of the glass trevor notices someone has been standing behind him
he whirls around and is face to face with our worst nightmare pinhead
its too late
pinhead lashes out at trevor striking his face with a clawed hand the rips his face clean off
the lights are back up as trevor slams against the machine and grabs his face
its still there
where pinhead was standing is the woman who just slapped him
she is attractive and studious
her sensible business attire cant hide a very curvaceous body
this is trevors supervisor gwen
jesus what the hell was that
its like you saw a ghost or something
trevor slowly peers into the vending machine
nobody here but your average every day candy bars
trevor is dumbfounded
angrily come on speak up gooding im trying to run a business here
i cant have people flipping out in the break room when they should be slaving away at their desks
sorry i just kind of
spaced for a second there
well dont let it happen again
or i may have to spank you
gwen grins sinfully at trevor and pushes his shoulders back against the vending machine
before he realizes it shes kissing him real hard
he gently ducks out from under her freeing himself
get back here junior bean counter
this is your supervisor speaking
youre youre all over me
how do you think you got this job cock
cozying up to him mmm
im still tingling all over from our little midnight swim
trevor looks constipated
he has no recollection of this
gwen strokes his face
whats wrong trev
gwen i really like you and it shows
least it did last night at the quarry
in a big way
trevor gently pushes her off him again
please youre going way too fast for me here
youre giving me a speeding ticket
mario andretti himself
gwen my wifes dead
oh i see
i realize it must be hard
but christ how long does it take someone to move on
that was cold
no making another woman compete with someone whos been dead eight months
this goes through trevor like a shot
here we go dolly in zoom out
in close up of trevor we
quick flashes of kirstys hand pounding on the windshield the car sinking into the lake a quick cut of a dark figure with a bright ring and shots of two
naked bodies slamming against each other in climax course through trevors mind
finally over the images of erotica we hear gwens voice as one of the characters
gwen contd yeah trevor thats it
and back in the real world trevor is now locking lips with a very ready gwen
his hand is up her skirt
he stops abruptly and pulls back
im sorry gwen
i dont know whats happening to me
zipping up i think its the painkillers really
gwen rolls her eyes
she re adjusts her self and now getting a little pissy
shes heard this one before
they mess with my head
yesterday gets blacked out and a memory from months ago is played out in vivid technicolor
like the accident just happened you know
gwen softens up
trevor is so earnest so vulnerable
why dont you let me take you out tonight
i promise to make it the most memorable night of your life
she kisses him
he braces himself
she grabs his butt then goes for the door
pick you up round seven
get some fucking work done
trevor relentlessly crunches numbers at his computer
he pauses a moment to stretch and rubs his eyes
a ping from his computer announces he has an interoffice memo file attached
trevor goes to the mailbox on his screen clicks
up comes a jpeg slideshow
each picture is of gwen dressed in a piece of sexy lingerie
the caption underneath reads work harder
looking around his cubicle he then takes another look at the jpeg
trevor stands up in the cubicle and we see him peer the outer office looking for gwen
he sits back down
embarrassed trevor closes the memo at least for now
trevors phone rings
startleing him and us
he picks it up
into phone you got trevor
from phone trevor hi this is detective lange from homicide
its about your wife
push in on to a bewildered trevor
it is a dank crumbling room
a place where sunlight is not welcome
detective lange a handsome graying gentleman whos plagued with a chronic case of post nasal drip sits at his desk
trevor sits across from him
behind trevor is another empty desk
as lange speaks he sniffs wetly every so often
to trevor thanks for coming down mr
has your head healed okay by now
wheres my wife
heres the scoop
lange takes out nasal drops and squeezes some in each nostril as he speaks
lange contd contd we still havent been able to locate your the body in that river
and missing persons turned up some evidence that qualified the disappearance as foul play
for one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge the tires were all intact from what we could tell nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either
like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally
it should all in the report
i told you guys everything
she was giving birth in the fucking car
she grabbed the wheel and i lost control
i did read that yes
flipping through the report what hospital were you going to
i mean the lodovico street bridge isnt exactly on the way to mercy general
trevor looks numb unable to answer
lange poker faced keeps looking through the reoport
lange cont contd listen we really are at a stalemate here until we find the body itself
is there any way you did not tell missing persons everything that happened just before that accident
why wouldnt i tell you everything
impatiently look ive been fully cooperative
quick to add to my recollection
im sorry mr
gooding i meant no disrespect
im just doing my job here ok
i mean between your head injury and the fact that you are on very strong pain medication you might not be remembering a few details about the crash which might
help us here
lange takes a deep hit of the nasal spray
lange contd what youre recalling could be a fabrication youve made up about it
do you follow
close on trevors face as he wrestles with this notion
kirstys eyes are closed
she is motionless
trevor tries to look at her while watching the road at the same time
jesus wake up
this time she doesnt wake up
the car fishtails
trevor loses control and the car skids from one side of the bridge to the other careening toward the guardrail smash
the car is plummeting toward the river below
the car hits the surface
trevor flounders through a disoriented flurry of bubbles
he swims up to the passenger door and tries the handle
it wont give
unable to breathe trevor finally swims up
he breaks the surface and crawls onto the shore
he looks out at the car to where she should be trapped inside
trevors eyes are wide with desperation breath quickening the car is sinking fast
he looks at the car and calls out but there is no kristy insight
the car disappears under the surface
trevor hears something from above and looks up
a chunk of the bashed up guardrail is sailing right down toward him mr
you still in there
trevor blinks and looks around him
lange is sitting just where they were when he saw him last
only now theres a very wary look on his face
yes detective sorry
just trying to recollect you know
from what i remember now maybe my wife was thrown from the car when it hit the water
maybe she wasnt trapped inside
lange checks the report again
he believes trevor
or does he
thats a start
ill tell the people trawling the river maybe it makes a difference maybe not
thanks for your help trevor
if we have any more questions youll get a call from myself or my partner detective givens
lange stands up and backs up awkwardly to a file behind his desk
trevor stares at him suspiciously
you guys know something i dont
all things considered we probably know a lot less than you do
have a good afternoon mr
trevor exits both men maintain eye contact as the door closes between him
the bus pulls up to the curb
trevor climbs out and starts walking down the empty street
as soon as the bus pulls away the only sound heard is trevors footsteps
pov behind trevor we see trevors back from a slight distance
someone is following him
sensing this trevor looks behind him
nothing but an empty sidewalk
trevor hurries his pace almost there at his apartment building
he glances behind him again
nope nobody there
then suddenly a dark figure passes under a streetlight on the opposite side of the street
trevor turns a corner no picking up the pace a little
the dark figure follows it picks up its pace as well
trevors walks an d approaches a small alley way
should he take this home
a enraged pitbull nearly rips his nose off as it barks and lunges to the end of a heavy chain leash
trevor and us about piss our pants
the dog continues barking trevor regains his composure
suddenly the dogs attention moves toward the direction of the dark figure
amazingly it stops barking and actually cowers back into the shadows
spooked trevor rushes up to he hurries up to his apartment building and lets himself in
he looks out on the street
the figure is walking up the building opposite his
its features are shrouded in shadow but it is definitely staring at trevor who slams the apartment door behind him
he peers out at the street from inside the front hall
the figure is gone
trevors looks around the apartment
he opens the fridge it lights up the darkened room
he grabs one of the three items sitting on the wire racks
about to twist off the cap off a cold beer when a light out his window urges him to investigate
he draws the curtain open and gasps
pov out window staring back at him from a dimly lit window in the apartment building across the street is the shadowy man that followed trevor home
the mans face is shrouded in shadows but trevor can see hes holding something bundled up in a blanket
the light in the window winks out rendering it dark again
trevor can almost still see the figure somewhere in the darkness still gazing at him
trevor looks a little sick all of a sudden like he cant breathe
the bell from a distant cathedral begins to peel
trevor opens his mouth to draw in a breath but instead spits out a massive amount of water
trevor falls to the ground arms and legs thrashing heaving up mouthfuls of water
trevor is drowning
in the puddles of water we see bits of debris leaves pebbles etc
finally a hideous eel like creatures head pokes out of trevors gaping mouth it escapes and slithers across the floor up the window sill and out into the night
the ringing bell stops abruptly and he takes in a humongous lungful of sweet oxygen
he then notices he is completely dry
stunned he looks about him
trevor is now laying on the easychair nursing a beer
his videogame is flashing play again
the bing bong
of his doorbell startles him
trevor gets the door to find a striking young gothic woman on the other side
black hair lipstick fingernails
she smiles too brightly for someone with such somber appointments then summarily lifts her shirt to just below her breasts for trevor
here it is what do you think
trevor looks down at her stomach the lower half of which contains tattoos which just break the surface of her jeans
at its center is a navel pierced with a studded black pearl which gothic woman then plays with
trevor looks a little confused
i saw it on the counter looked at the name and the rest is history
its like named after me
getting uncomfortable oh
im sorry ive just been having a weird day
i totally understand
listen i dont know if youre into incense but i bought some its called witching hour
to inhale it is to love it
i mean the stuffll clear your head big time
come on over ill burn some for you
if you cant sleep tonight
she jabs a thumb down the hall behind her
knock on my door im a total insomniac
no thanks ive got a
a date tonight his eyes roaming her he finally finds a tattoo on her shoulder reading tawny
eyebrows raised whew
you bounce right back dont you
what do you mean
didnt your like
whole life get totalled last week
the car accident
any of this ringing a bell
trevor eyes her nervously then its not that kind of date
hey even if it is more power to ya
awkwardly alrighty then
have a good time
tawny ambles off to her apartment
trevor closes the door and leans against it
he slides down the door and covers his face with his hands
another headache coming on
trevor paces in his living room
looks at watch
then the door
still no sign of gwen
trevor rummages through a closet
reaching up to a shelf above him he tugs at a big cardboard box and pulls
the entire box comes crashing down and out spill about fifty vhs tapes all hand labeled kirsty trevor then the date
he puts one in the vcr hits play
its his wedding video
trevor watches the festivity of the wedding on the screen he smiles for the first time
the wedding portion of the tape ends and a not so clean edit takes us into the honeymoon
trevor holds the camera on kristy who is under the covers in a generic hotel room
she looks into camera as trevor adjusts focus and squares up the frame
its been one year
three hundred sixty five days
eight thousand seven hundred sixty hours
five hundred twenty five thousand
kirsty watches trevor roam the room
she very comfortable on camera
how does feel to be mr
kirsty hughes for a whole year
in a word
the best business decision if you ever made ill bet
the merger never even felt work for one second
you know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day
never to put you in my will
because youd be staying with me for me and not because youd get rich if i died for some reason
but you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet there is no wisdom no insight no plan prvb they share a moment
kristy stares at him quietly through the camera
and besides i thought to hell with it
its okay if you only married me for my money
really whys that
i only married you for your body
the camera now looks away from kristy and into trevors suitcase
trevors pulls out a wrapped present
a small tightly wrappped perfectly square gift
what are you doing
the camera now back on kristy
and the present comes up into frame
happy anniversary mrs
come here you
the camera begins to wobble as trevor climbs onto the bed
its lands sideways and we see sheets and covers rustling accompanied by the sound of giggling and kissing
the tape ends
from the couch trevor watches this
any of this ringing a bell
trevor gets up and pops the tape out
he slowly walks toward the door
he opens it to find a pitch dark hallway
whos out there
gwen suddenly comes out of the darkness clamping her mouth onto his and examining his tonsils with her tongue
sorry im late dear
trevor looks like hed be more turned on sitting bare assed on an autopsy table
gwen you scared the living shit out of me
she pushes him toward the chair and sits him in it
you are turning into an old fuddy duddy
gwen puts one foot on his chest
come on dont make me beat you
trevor pulls the shoe off
trevor does the same for the other leg
looking around wheres is it
our little toy
you usually have it up and running by now
do i really want to know what youre talking about
the cable from the camera runs all the way to the tv where we see whats happening as well
gwen is on top
gwen aggressively pulls trevors shirt off then goes for his belt
trevor suddenly grabs her hands
youre kidding me
im sorry gwen
i just cant
gwen climbs off the chair and throws her jacket back on
you have definitely got a screw loose trevor
stuffing her feet in her shoes gwens out the door
trevor sighs relieved the attack is finally over
about to turn the tv off and stow away his camera
he looks at the tv and freezes
the image on the tv shows that gwen is still there undressing trevor
only video trevor is giving in kissing her back pulling her clothes off
trevor looks at the camera
the red record light is flashing
trevor turns back to the tv walking closer and closer to the screen
what the hell
he waves a hand in front of the camera and his hand actually appears on the tv in front of the sex image
trevor and gwen make love in video
video trevor turns to the the camera to trevor and gives a menacing smile
video trevor looks back up at gwen who smiles down at him carnivorously
she licks her lips
theres one thing i should have told you right from the beginning trevor
video trevor doesnt see a knife she manages to slip out of her purse
i like it pretty rough
to trevors shock gwen suddenly drags the knife right across his throat
blood shoots up at gwens grinning face
blood pours out of trevors mouth and down his chest
from the color screen trevor having just seen himself get murdered shouts no
allison stands above him bic razor in her gloved hand
the bottom half of trevors face is covered with shaving cream
sorry i thought you were going to stay under longer
his face is clean shaven a little shaving cream remains around his chin
he now has several electrodes attached to his cranium
theyre connected to an eeg which beeps loudly
the noise bothers trevor
his eyes dart this way and that
he focuses on the bic razor
whats happening to me
what are you doing
you came in for your eeg
you fell asleep and well i took the liberty of
you looked like a wreck trevor
trevor seems to like the attention
i just had the most vivid dream
i was sure i was dying
well you can relax now you are quite alive
and as long as youre awake chin up
trevor puts his chin up and allison continues shaving his neck
trevor studies her face
what do you say trevor
groggily let me see
my head feels like its going through a meat grinder
im not sure if im dreaming or
interupting that poor me attitude doesnt suit you trevor
listen i dont mean to sound like pollyanna but things could be worse
theres one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life
everything is new and exciting like your seeing it for the first time
you might see things a litlle differently from now on
your insight is enlightening
no wisdom no insight no plan
allison gives him a wink disarming trevor
my wife said that exact same sentence to me the day we got married
she even winked too
allison smiles and puts her hand on his
do you use this wife thing to hit on all the interns
allison wipes his face clean with a towel
just like a babys butt
allison gets up grabs a clipboard starts filling out a report
trevor stares at her
why cant remember what happened to my wife
is it something im on thats
thats making me forget
easy there trevor
you need to relax
no i need to remember
look whatever it is take me off it
i can handle pain
i cant handle not knowing
you need to get better first trevor
scribbling in the chart its okay to miss somebody
its okay to still love someone after theyre gone
but youve got to quit blaming yourself okay
allison looks up and notices trevors body has slackened his eyes empty
she drops the clipboard and starts snapping her fingers over his eyes
he is unconscious
a loud steady buzz sounds from one of the machines behind her as blood begins to leak out of trevors ear
allison jumps up and hits call button above trevors bed
she yanks trevors johnnie down wheels a defribulator over to his dying body and grabs the paddles
its okay trevor im coming for you
allison rubs the paddles together presses the paddles against trevors chest and trevor sits bolt upright in his bed
his alarm clock is making that same buzzing noise
trevor is completely disoriented
he sees a note laying next to him on the bed
it says iyoure an animal baby
you know who
i he finally looks at the clock
seven forty five
shit im gonna be late
trevor is on his computer typing madly
on the screen we see he has accessed the local newspaper
he calls up an article reading accident leaves one hospitalized another missing
he looks at a newspaper picture of the bridge which is humming with rescue activity
trevors head is pounding
he goes into his desk drawer and pulls out a bottle of aspirin
trevor empties the last of the bottles six tablets into his hand downs them chases them with whats left of an economy sized bottle of mylanta
trevor cant seem to even look at his computer screen
he hears a ding ding and looks up
he has an instant office message waiting
trevor clicks ok
the instant message reads iits too late
i trevor rapidly types up
iwho is this
i the same message is repeated
iits too late
its too late
its too late
i trevor stands up and looks around mazelike structure of cubicles as far as he can see
all of his co workers are slaving away on their keypads
trevor sits back down and cancels the instant message
he ruminates for a moment
from behind brets fingers tapping on the keyboard seem to get louder more frustrated
they finally stop and bret stretches momentarily
must be nice
getting paid for doing shit
bret goes back to work again fingers hammering away
come on bret
seriously man you oughta work for the government
youve got the sense of urgency for it
trevor himself begins to type slowly reluctantly
look im doing my best considering okay
hey if the boss doesnt notice who cares right
just slack all the live long day if you want
the boss wont notice me doing a bad job because im not
even if the boss thought i was slacking id know right away
yeah hows that
smug i have my connections really
he then looks at trevor eyes bulging
i crap you not
she was all over me yesterday in the break room
and she was a total machine last night too
you were supposed to have a date with gwen last night
serious as a heart attack my friend
i think she literally fucked me brains out
super sarcastic wow thats quite a feat trevor congratulations
must be really tough to get your brains fucked out by a corpse
trevor stops and looks at bret
what are you talking about
this is your sick joke man
gwen was murdered here six months ago
the security guard found her all over her office
her head was in the waste paper basket
her stomach was in the filing cabinet
her ass was on the copy machine
trevor is speechless
they never found the sicko who did it
trevor still cant speak
he goes into his computer mailbox and re opens the file hed received from iyou know who
i he stifles a scream when he sees the jpegs have changed
sure theyre still of gwen
pieces of her swimming in puddles of her own blood
where it once said iwork harderi it now says ipolice file
i to himself jesus christ
trevor looks behind him to make sure bret hasnt seen any of this
hes facing his own computer typing away
man are you ever out of the loop
either that or youve got the worst sense of humor this side of jeffrey dahmer
what is your problem anyway
trevor quickly deletes the entire file
i think i lost my mind
and now im finding pieces of it like pieces of a wrecked car scattered on the side of the road
bud you need to decompress
i told you you came back to work too soon after the accident
trevor says nothing
hey you know what trev
im going to hook you up man
bret wheels across the cubicle on his chair and hands something to trevor
its an oddly designed postcard bearing some sort of voodoo mask
the font is faux oriental the kind they use for chinese take out menus
he looks closer
its an appointment card for an acupuncturist
this woman will take one look at you and know exactly what you need
a chart of all the puncture points on the human body is tacked to the wall
trevor lies on the table
sage a gorgeous ethereal indian woman is at the far end hovering over the soles of his feet sticking pins into the appropriate places
she looks up at him slyly
these headaches youve been getting
do they happen in conjunction with the hallucinations
sage walks over to one of the cabinets gathering more acupuncture needles
trevor cant help but notice her shapely body her feline gait
sage throws a sultry glance over her shoulder at him prompting him to finally answer her question
unsure of himself yes sort of
trevor contd my heads been in constant pain since the
and the pain increases whenever i uh
slip into another i dont know what to call them
sage comes back to him several needles in one hand
she looks into his eyes
i was going to say dimensions
but i guess technically they are dreams
you should always listen to your subconscious
its trying to tell you something about your waking life
sage begins applying the needles fluidly to his upper body now
but i never feel like im sleeping
its sort of waking narcolepsy
ill be somewhere and then snapping his fingers its like i was never wherever i was to begin with i was really somewhere else entirely
sage puts the last needle in
for the first time trevor actually feels a releief of pressure in his head
trevor contd ok whatever that was
do it again
that just set me free of the worlds longest head ache
is this making any sense
now just relax
let the needles do the driving
a phone outside the office rings
sage looks up at the door
patting his cheek dont go anywhere
ill be right back
trevor watches sage exit the office
he lies there a moment bathing in warm sunshine
he is relaxed pain free
behind him an acupuncture anatomy chart on the wall
which begins to change its shape
it morphs or economically changes into pinhead
trevor is oblivious as pinhead approaches doll eyes betraying no feeling whatsoever
then pinhead reaches up to his head and begins pulling out one of those infamous pins
it takes a while to come out
because it is a foot long
once out the needle drips with black ooze
trevor hears a noise and believes its sage whos reentered the room
im thinking this might just be what i needed
pinhead speaks but in sages voice
as he pushes on of the pins into the tip trevors skin in his back
no matter what happens just remember
before trevor can react pinhead suddenly jabs the pin down into trevors back pinning him to the table
it sears his skin
in pinheads recognizable voice
were all here for you trevor
as trevor reels in terror pinhead pulls another foot long needle from his head and thrusts this one into his neck
we see the needle come right out the other side nailing itself into the table
trevor cant believe hes still alive
pinhead pulls one more out aims this one at trevors arm and swings down
quick cuts allison pokes trevors arm with a hypodermic
she places a reassuring hand on his chest
machines behind her are pinging and buzzing like crazy
allison looks a little worried
go back to sleep
allison blurs out of focus
then briefly comes back into focus
only now its a man inside a darkened room
trevors pov buried in the murky shadow all that can be seen are his hands lit by a shaft of sunlight beaming through a blinded window
a ring on the mans left pinky finger glimmers eerily almost too much
we saw this man in an earlier flashback hes holding something
he speaks in an echoed and i know
divorce isnt good enough
abandonment isnt good enough
theres only one way to do it and do it cleanly without leaving a trace of evidence
the darkened man pushes the cube across the desk towards us
open this and your problem will disappear forever
and no one will ever suspect you
a word of caution though
a certain side effect of the box
pleasures that would redefine the parameters of sensation
trevors picks up the cube
once the cube is opened there is no turning back
a loud buzzing noise begins drowning out the darkened mans words as we dissolve to trevor quietly wakes up to the sound of his alarm buzzing again
he stares at the ceiling
trevor pushes through the front doors and a receptionist greets him with a big smile and a business card
afternoon doll face
hey a police detective was just here to see you
looking at the card some guy named givens
she hands the card to him batting her eyelashes
trevor looks at the card as she checks out his package
trevor reads the word homicide
uh thanks this looks a little important
could you let the folks upstairs know ill be late
for you bubbalicious
winking id lay across a bed of nails
trevor walks back out and the receptionist watches him go
another female employee walks by staring at trevor
she looks at the receptionist and they both nod in agreement
you know it girl
that ass is a three hummer baby
mmm mmm mmm
same office only trevor is sitting at the other desk across from a hawklike man who is playing with a yoyo
this is givens
if good cop bad cop is the scheme here hes the latter
i dont understand how this is a homicide case
i mean nobody was murdered here
her bodys been missing for i dont know how long now and
what did you just say
i said shes been missing for no
no you said her bodys been missing
whats the difference
last time anybody saw this woman she was alive
you seem to certain shes dead
tearing up i saw her drowning inside the car detective
i read up on you man
youre a smart guy arent you
i mean with numbers
you could say that
zeros a number right
as in one minus one equals zero yes
where are you going with this
how many zeros was your wife worth
brow furrowing trevor stands up
i need to talk to my attorney
givens pushes his phone toward trevor who takes it and dials furiously
givens remains poker faced
trevor dials a number
into phone yes i need larry ellis office please
he says the lawyers name like its supposed to intimidate givens
he couldnt care less
a beat yeah this is trevor gooding i need to speak with larry
kirsty goodings husband
another beat i see do you know when hell be out that meeting
fine ill uh
call back then
okay you give him the message and hell call me thats great
with that trevor hangs up the phone and exits the office
givens busts out laughing
trevor types bitterly on the computer crunching numbers like a madman
i dont know what pissed you off but its nice to see you getting the job done for a change
trevor plays his videogame with venom
the cries of his kills emanate from the tv building to a crescendo
finally we hear a womans voice come from the tv
trevor flicks the replay button
trevor stares at the self taken picture of him and his wife mugging at the camera
what is it that kirsty is holding
the tv is on
trevor flips through the channels
he stops on the nature channel
a goat is casually munching on some nuts and berries
from tv at the dawning of the agrarian age goats milk would be considered a suitable substitute for a mothers breast milk
and the sacrifice of a goat would appease an angry god and ensure a bountiful harvest
but in time the ritual would become associated with less hallowed purposes
goats blood is said to hold supernatural properties linked to black magic
in conjunction with the pentangle the five pointed star the spilling of goats blood is considered to be either an aphrodisiac that can be used in demonic orgies or a
means by which a high priest may summon satan himself
an illustration of a goat with many eyes appears on the screen
from tv the book of revelations speaks of the anti christ as the beast with many eyes
for centuries illustrators have chosen a goat to represent this beast
his eyes hurting too much to watch any more trevor turns the tv off
out of sheer instinct he suddenly turns to look the apartment across the street is lit
a strange figure is standing in the window
trevor jumps up and rushes over to his window
he looks out at that same shadowy man he saw earlier
the mans face is still obscured and is still holding something in a blanket
squinting trevor is able to make out what it is a sleeping baby
the stranger pulls the babys blanket over the babys angelic face
then the light in that apartment goes out abruptly
trevor stares at the darkened window breathing heavily
is the stranger still in there watching trevor in the dark
trevor cannot tell
a sudden knocking at the door makes him flinch
trevor goes to the door opens it to find tawny
only now shes dressed in a skintight black rubber dress
she smiles accentuating a fresh coat of black lipstick
can i borrow something
tawny grabs the back of his neck pulling him to her as she kisses him deeply
she grabs his collar and pulls him out to the hallway
she turns around leading trevor through the hall like a horse
a very confused horse
whats what are you doing
trevor eyes her gorgeous body and decides not to resist quite so much
trevor leans against the counter sipping at a glass of wine nervously
right next to him tawnys at the stove stirring a pot of something dark and bubbly
she looks up at him smiling seductively
but trevors still a few lengths behind
im uh not sure
feeling kind of weird actually
tawny grabs trevors balls and he jumps away as if jolted by a cattle prod
im kinda feeling nuts myself
ive never said this to a woman before but cant we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other
sometimes you can be such an animal
other times you are the ultimate tease
she holds up a spoonful of what shes been stirring
it looks like stew
keeping a hand below his waist trevor leans toward the spoon tastes licks his lips
lots of capers huh
its also got fennel asparagus olives some more of mother natures aphrodisiacs
back in college me and my roommates used to call it hard on stew
not a very appetizing name
have some more
trevor takes another sip of it
if you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room you knew one of us was in there getting laid
you must have been very proud of yourselves
its getting hot in here
tawny summarily unzips her rubber dress and whips it off
trevor is speechless
tawnys body is covered with bites and bruises
who did that to you
tawny busts out laughing
youre kidding right
trevor shakes his head no
god you are funny tonight
tawny approaches trevor who tenses up
almost like im with somebody else
trevor starts looking very ill
tawny i think im going to be sick
well now theres a compliment
trevor grabs his stomach lurching over
he cant breath
trevor looks up at tawny
but it is no longer her
tawny has changed into something else entirely
the cenobite rips trevors shirt open and we can see movement within his abdomen
like a baby kicking
whatevers in their shoots up expanding trevors chest cavity
the cenobite pins trevor to the wall and hovers in his face as if about to kiss him
before trevor can scream he is choking
the cenobite watches with glee as something begins to move up into trevors throat expanding his neck forcing his jaws open and finally
a black eel pokes its head out of trevors mouth
the cenobite opens its own mouth and the eel starts to crawl inside it
meanwhile trevors about to pass out from asphyxiation when he takes a deep grateful breath through an oxygen mask
the various pieces of monitoring equipment around him are beeping and pinging like slot machines
allison walks around the room pressing buttons that silent each machine one by one then walks up to the bed looking surprisingly calm
sorry about that
there was a blockage in your oxygen hose
wont happen again promise
trevor looks relieved
shell shocked but relieved
im certainly keeping you busy huh
smiling too bad i hate my job
she strokes his forehead
feeling better now
trevor shakes his head
these hallucinations im having
i think theyre more like memories coming back to me in a strange way
well thats not necessarily a bad thing is it
if theyre blocked memories
im starting to realize the reason why i blocked them out
allison i think i really
screwed everything up
dont blame yourself trevor
i miss her
i miss my wife
trevor takes her hand
allison looks briefly around her then
climbs onto the bed with him
if you need to cry go ahead
i wont tell
holding her hand to his face trevor closes his eyes squeezing out a tear
close on trevors face
we start to notice subtle differences about allisons hand
it is very pale the fingernails black
trevor opens his eyes
he is now lying on tawnys bed which is surrounded by unlit candles
sunlight streams through her open window
it is her hand he is holding to his face
the rest of her is sitting under the sheet covered head propped against the headboard
trevor drops her hand and it falls lifelessly to the bed beside him
breathing quickening he reaches up to the black silk sheet covering her head
he yanks it back and covers his mouth in horror
shes been bound to the bed and gagged with a white cloth that is soaked with blood
a deep vertical incision has been made in her neck collarbone to chin and her tongue is pulled through the wound so it sticks out the bottom of her jaw
and thats just for starters
when trevor looks down he gags when he sees her ribcage has been opened like a set of french doors and her insides sitting in her lap
the coup de grace
trevor now sees he is covered with blood
trevor splashes his face with cold water trying to get his composure back
he stares at the water rushing down the drain for a moment
his breathing stabilizes he finally looks up at his reflection in the mirror
to see pinhead staring back at him
trevor jolts backward in shock and does a double take
its him now looking completely unhinged
outside the phone rings
the answering machine picks up with a beep
from answering machine this is lange
we need to talk as soon as possible
its about your little
give me a call
cleaned up now trevor carefully makes his way back to tawnys apartment
he tries the door
this cant be right
he jiggles the door knob violently then finally kicks the door
suddenly tawny answers the door looking utterly pissed off
though still in goth mode shes dressed much more conservatively now
can i help you
i youre trevor goes to embrace her
she shrinks back startled
whoa i have serious space issues dude
what do you want
think we need to talk theres something really strange going on
a look of recognition hey youre the guy from down the hall
come on quit fucking around
listen its about
what we did together last night
utterly shocked a very deep voice comes from somewhere behind her
who the fuck is that
its that guy from down the hall
he thinks we did something with him last night
whos whos in there with you
tawny looks aghast
are you cracking up or something
suddenly an enormous brute of a man wide as he is tall enters the doorway
hes wearing a black tee black jeans and trevor cant help notice black nail polish
on fingers and toes
obviously tawnys significant other
what can we do for you chief
who are you
brute takes a sideward step through the doorway forcing trevor back two steps
you know tawny you better know me pal
i dont want any trouble
i was mistaken
ill see you later
trevor turns and hurries off
brute turns to tawny who shrugs and makes a twirly motion at her temple
the two go back into her apartment
trevor paces in his apartment telephone to his ear
he lets out a heavy breath and looks at his watch
finally city police main switchboard how may i direct your call
you already asked me that ten minutes ago just before you put me on hold
im looking for defective i mean detective lange
oh he and his partner just stepped out to lunch can i
trevor hangs up
trevor sits at the front of the bus agitated
he folds and unfolds detective langes business card in his hands like some frustrated origami artist
the siren from a passing ambulance drills his ears
the irritating sound eventually fades away but the pain in his head is still there
the bonging of a distant cathedrals bell makes him pause
he looks around
toward the rear and sees a familiar old lady knitting a babys bootie
he looks again
the bootie is bright red and dripping
trevor follows the strand of bright red wool down to their source a dying goat laying under the seat
its insides have been ripped out
its veins and tendons are serving as the old ladys yarn
trevors eyes bolt back up to the old woman
she continues humming sweetly her lap speckled with goats blood
trevor pulls the wire and an obnoxious buzzing goes off
trevor hurries up to the bus driver as the bus pulls over
just open the doors ill jump off
not while the bus is moving sir
trevor clutches his head in pain and waits for the bus to stop
the doors open
he jumps off knees nearly buckling from the pain
he looks up as the bus speeds off
in the rear window the little black girl seen earlier pops up
shes holding her little doll
she pushes a clothespin into its head
blood drips from the puncture
at the same time trevor feels an incredible pain sear through his head
he squints at the bus again
the little girl is gone
lange is at his desk eating a sandwich
trevor comes in angrier than a hornet in a beehive
wheres my wife detective lange
what the hell did you do with her
gooding i assure you we are doing everything within our why did you leave me that message
i dont know what youre talking about
trevor slams his hand down on langes desk and gets right in his face
trevor immediately turns around and walks out
larry ellis is a somber but handsome young attorney
at present he at his desk poring through several books on child custody law
he makes notes on a pad beside him as he talks
not looking up basically they know where your wifes body is and theyre not telling you as a tactic to get you to confess
yet neither of them has come out and told you that youre a suspect
is that what youre trying to say
trevor sits on the other side of the humongous office in a chair so big it practically swallows him whole
look larry i know you never thought too much of me
and i know this all sounds a little fucked up
i swear these guys are like playing mindgames with me
i think they got a hold of my e mail address at work too
larry is not buying this for a nanosecond
he trims some brown leaves off a small plant as he speaks
trevor barring the more outrageous aspects of your claim you are not the only widower the police have questioned when foul play is suspected
hey ninety five point three percent of all murders are committed by either a spouse a direct relative or a close friend thats common knowledge
but this wasnt murder it was an accident concentrating on his notes and as far as hiding a body goes
i find it hard to believe even the dirtiest of cops would keep a victims remains hidden simply to get someone to confess
its absolutely preposterous
now im not saying i dont believe you im
theres quite alot of money behind all this
how much do i stand to inherit if kirsty is presumed dead
larry sighs and walks over to his desk
he presses a button on his intercom
rosie can you bring in the gooding papers
from intercom right away mr
ballpark would be fine larry
in the vicinity of eight million four hundred fifty thousand
or is it sixty what happens if im convicted of kirstys murder
well theyd have to prove it in a court of law for one thing
pretend you like me and humor me
seeing you were her sole benefactor and im the executive of the will kirstys entire estate would have to be donated to the city
its a fucking conspiracy
pardon my glibness trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic
the next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type
youre obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse
thanks for your concern larry
and fuck you too
trevor gets up and heads for the door
to trevors back i never thought your late wife was the sharpest knife in the drawer
but marrying you was the dumbest thing she ever did
on his way out trevor nearly runs down larrys assistant who was just coming in with a large file
trevor looks despondently out the window
the cab stops and trevor hands some money to the cabbie up front
you can go
im going to be here a while
trevor gets out of the cab which drives off leaving him on the bridge looking down at the water below
police tape flaps between the trees
other than that there is no sign of an investigation
trevor walks out of the woods on the shore through the police tape and to the waters edge
he begins to walk the shore looking out at the still water
he scans the area where the water meets the land trying to remember
something on the surface few feet away catches his eye
its a rock sticking up
no its something else
trevor walks right up to the water and puts his feet on a couple of large rocks breaking the surface
he bends down and looks at
the corner of a black cube
he quickly reaches down tries to pick it up
it seems to be stuck just below the surface
trevor pulls harder and finally it gives
trevor slowly lifts the black cube out of the water and gasps when he sees trevor gasps and lets go
and just as the cube along with its owner splash under the surface another white hand breaks the surface grabbing trevors wrist
as trevor struggles he looks up to see the dark figure standing above him holding a rock over his head
just as he swings down towards trevors head smash cut to trevor jumps scaring the hell out of allison who has just gotten done taking his pulse
jesus i wish you would stop doing that
trevor looks down at himself
hes on an examination table in his normal clothes not a hospital johnnie
thats a good sign
trevor tries to put his thoughts together
what have you got to say for yourself
voice quivering allison we have got to talk about this medication youve got me on
im all over it
allison shines a penlight in his eye
satisfied allison sits on the bed next to trevor and takes his hand
what were going to do is up the topomax to two per day instead of one see if that takes care of these hallucinatory seizures youve been having
the extra topomax wont interfere with the painkillers either but
youre going to be thrilled to hear this part but we have been told by some patients it affects the memory somewhat
does it affect the memory
allison looks concerned
then her features soften
youre one tough cookie trevor gooding
you keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round
some call it resilience
allison lets a lapse in the conversation last too long
that look of concern returns as she lingers on his face
shes trying to say something
everything okay allison
surprised at her own emotional outflow of course yes
the way you just looked at me
i know my bedside manners horrendous
allison finishes writing a few notes and trevors rolls down his sleves
so im done
thats it for today
neither of them want this visit to be over
trevor contd how bout some lunch
the two share the end of an empty cafeteria table eating off pastel colored trays
think about it
in the entire world wheres the most life threatening place you could possibly be at any given moment
i dont know
its not a geographical location
its inside a moving car
ive got numbers to back me up
over the course of one year more americans die in car accidents than did during the entire span of world war ii
whats the safest place
inside a moving bus
millions of people around the world get on busses every day
when was the last time you heard of anybody anywhere dying on a public transit bus
statistics ive got one for you
whats the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen
that was easy street
second most common
eighty third most common
you just made that up
like youre gonna check
they both chuckle trevors expression gets serious
after a moment of silence
where you two happy together
we startred off to be
she was i guess i was
i just sort of
butchered up the relationship somehow
to himself bad choice of words
i understand i think
its like i was a different guy then i am today
i cant remember that guy
i see these women they think im someone else and im not that guy anymore
im not sure who kristy knew
you were unfaithful it sounds like your confessing
i did more then that
allison reaches accross the table for trevors hand
a quiet moment
how bout some fresh air
trevor and allison sit in a couple of chairs looking out at the other rooftops around them
lucky for us these chairs happened to be here
oh i knew about the chairs already
this is where the emphysema patients come to sneak cigarettes
she points to the ground at myriad butts scattered at their feet
trevor smiles and looks at his hands
dont tell me
kirsty used to smoke
she just would have loved it up here
allison when i was under
did i ever talk
sure plenty of times
was there anything i said that made you stop and wonder you know where did that come from
sure plenty of times
trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming
so practically everything say is going to sound strange
did i ever talk about the accident
did i ever talk about kirsty
but at one point you did repeat something though
you must have been having this recurring dream you just kept saying this one thing over and over what was it
you said jealousy arouses a husbands fury and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge
proverbs does that mean anything to you trevor
it means i have alot more questions
trevor stares off into the distance
times up for today
ive got to get back
allison smiles and pats trevors knee
he melts and puts his hand on hers
she slowly takes it away and fixes her hair
if it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control i had
trevor i never date patients
i wont no you dont understand
thats why ive been fighting to get you better
so you wouldnt be a patient anymore
why didnt you tell me sooner
i would have switched doctors
just get better okay
she caresses his face then looks at her watch
i have to get back to work
and so do you
trevor walks through the maze of cubicles a big smile on his face
hes actually having a good day
brets already looking up at trevor as he enters
dont say a word bret
trevors smile disappears when he sees someones already sitting in his chair
hes on trevors computer surfing the internet
to lange guess ill leave you two alone
concentrating on the computer nice chatting with ya
bret gets up and leaves as trevor approaches lange
sorry im in your seat arent i
no please make yourself at home
trevor sits in brets chair as lange logs off and swivels to face trevor
hows everything mr
cant we dispense with the games for once
i thought you loved games
ill just stay out of this conversation until you come out and tell me why youve disrupted me at work
you and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident werent you
where is she
where is my wife
lange shakes his head and pulls something else out of his pocket
its the cube sealed in a ziploc
trevor cannot conceal a feeling of dread
we found this curious little object not too far from the site of the accident
no prints but forensics scraped a little dark residue that was caked on one of the corners
it was blood trevor
matched some blood we took off your car seat too
can you tell me anything about it
to lange it looks familiar
i think it was in the car
gee you think so
lange puts the cube back in his pocket and stands up
sorry to take up your time like that trevor
dont work too hard
oh before i forget
i talked your neighbor out of pressing charges
the whackjob in the black lipstick who lives down the hall
she wanted you arrested for harassment
i told her to chill out and smoke a joint
id look the other way as long as she did you know
were all here for you trevor
lange gets up and exits
trevor satys seated after a beat he stands up looking over his cubicle and sees det
givens staring back at him from the door
trevors sits back down
trevor suddenly clutches his head as if its been killing him this whole time
he goes to his chair picks up the phone and dials
from phone were sorry the number you have has either been disconnected or no longer in service
if you feel you have reached this recording in error trevor hangs up
we can almost hear his head throbbing in pain
he turns around and theres bret leaning against his desk eating a frozen yogurt
staring at trevor
frogurt guys here
theyre all out chocolate vanilla swirl or id have gotten you one
im sure you would have
bret nods tosses the frozen yogurt container out and sits down
hey if youre not doing anything id like to buy you a beer after work
be just like old times
whats the occasion
todays my last day
this hits trevor like a ton of bricks
the place is practically empty
bret and trevor play darts and work on a pitcher of beer
country western plays on the jukebox
ive got a better offer
more time off
a sort of career shift more in the engineering line of work
how much time off
as much as he feels like
its a much more pleasurable line of work
as much as he likes
were all in this together trev
trevor there are people who are doing exactly what were doing but they dont need to wear a tie punch a clock or have some tight assed supervisor breathing down
its all about the pleasure trevor
so youre just packing it up just like that
almost that fast
i got a few loose ends to tie up first
came into a shitload of money recently
ive always wanted to go to take a trip
were just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there
you and who else
bret throws a dart with extra mph
it misses the board entirely and hits the wall
trevor winces in pain suddenly
he touches his head and looks at his fingers
trevor in the car in the water
thrashing about he bleeding from his head in the flashback as well
he looks in the passenger seat
trevor takes the cube from the man with the ring
he fumbles with the puzzle box in the darkness
it starts to move
trevor driving with kristy shes going down on him while hes driving
okay pull over
looking at his watch but
trevor waits a moment to see if shes kidding
through clenched teeth the car comes to a stop
trevor gets the goods while he watches himself in the rear view mirror
trevor zips up pulls kristy up out of his lap
its a cenobite
trevor screams and opens the door of the car to make a frantic exit
he dive out onto the pavement and looks back
all is quiet
hes alone a quiet road
he stands up and into an eerie world of slow motion
trevor looks up the road and back to find a beautiful vision of allison walking toward him
walking gracefully she approaches trevor
raises her hand to his face
trevor smiles then slowly looks back towards the car
inside the car he sees kristy playing with the puzzle box
trevors calls out to her
and he makes a move toward the car as the box comes to life
this stops trevor in his tracks and he looks toward allison
who is now pinhead
there is no reprieve for you
not even in her
shes only a vision im afraid
tervors looks dumbfounded
pinhead contd the truth hurts doesnt it
trevor raises his head from the bar
the beers are there but bret is gone
trevors stares at himself in the mirror opposite the bar
he looks like shit
he thinks hard about the flashback
out the door he goes
trevors holding the phone up to his ear agitated beyond belief
hed pace if he could
instead he just fumes
into phone yes im trying to reach one of your interns
she works in the emergency room there
what do you mean
i just saw her today
yes im sure she works there ive been in and out of that place five times in the last month
well good day to you too asshole
close up on trevors hand searching through the ds in the white pages
he slams the book shut in frustration
hes on the phone again
no such listing
could you at least tell me if she has an unlisted number
what do you mean there are no dormeres at all there have to be
well look again
a beat more timidly h hello
trevor slams the phone down and touches his head again
he looks at his hand
the blood is gone
but the headache is back
its crippling at this point
hes at his wits end
he reaches into his pocket and finds pages card
maybe as a last resort
the phone rings
it rings again
trevor presses his palm against his eye
trevor picks up the phone
into phone hello
from phone goodbye
you miserable sonofabitch
trevor is out of breath as he walks up to the last resort
the entrance to sages building
the front door is locked
he presses a three digit code on the alarm box
the phone picks up
sage its me trevor
youve got to help me
trevors head hits the pillow on the acupuncture table
the feeling is very distinct
its like somebody stuck a shard of glass through my eye and its embedded halfway into my brain
sage nods patient look on her face
trevor your body has been completely healed
all the nerve endings have repaired themselves
if there is any pain in your head its
in your head
jeez its getting awful crowded in there
you are physically better
its your soul that still hurts
sage grabs a bunch of needles from the table
my teacher told me once theres a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it even after youre dead
so that when you die youre trapped inside your body watching it corrode for all eternity
look whatever your marharagi told you forget
youve got to get this fuckin pain to stop
it was an analogy
your soul is locked up inside you
you need to free it trevor
youve blocked it from the healing process
thats what we need to do now
heal your soul
and to do that i you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or doubt
do you know what i mean by giving in
its about trust
do you trust me implicitly
i dont even know whats real and what isnt how can i trust anyone
you can trust me
your wife is dead and you need to move past that
and the only way to move past something completely is to go straight through it not around it
surrender yourself to your wifes death
let it chew you up and spit you back out on the other side
its the only way you can become whole again
sage looks trevor dead in the eye
are you ready
trevor closes his eyes of sage dimming the lights so that the room is nice and dark
placing needles into trevors body
trevor finally opens his eyes to find
hes completely naked on sages table
and shes making love to his body which is now filled with needles
what the hell is this
whispering surrender yourself
she holds up a small chunk of ice and begins rubbing it on trevors chest
he catches his breath at the cold and begins to shiver
trevor wakes up shivering
he is in the passenger seat head resting against a baby blanket
a hand touches his
its okay it was just a nightmare thats all
trevor looks at kirsty
she is breathtakingly beautiful
now go back to sleep
youre driving the rest of the way to grammas remember
trevor looks in the back and for the first time sees an infant girl sleeping in a car seat behind him
trevor ive decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mothers
this poor kids going to be starting preschool as student x if we dont make up our minds
so ive been thinking what about daisy
looking at the baby its perfect
well that was easy all of a sudden
trevor looks back at kirsty
im glad youre alive
louder piercing trevors ears
trevor winces in pain and blocks his ears from the noise
kirsty looks at him puzzled
he can only read her lips honey whats wrong
trevors eye rivet open again
a paramedic is snapping his fingers in front of them
another paramedic is readying a hypodermic
can you hear me
do you know where you are
were just gonna take some blood here
the other paramedic sticks a needle in trevors arm
you know what day it is
trevor shakes his head
the paramedic holds up two fingers
okay how many fingers am i holding up
can you follow them
paramedic moves his hand left to right
trevor keeps his eyes on it
hey you remember what happened back there
when the car went off the bridge
laughing wow you are out of it
paramedic contd no it was nothing that extreme
you were riding on the bus and just collapsed onto the floor
remember being on a bus now
i dont know
here we are
the ambulance comes to a stop
a couple of orderlies wheel trevor into the exact room hes been coming to this whole time
the orderlies exit and who should enter but dr
and the angular nurse who readied him for the brain surgery at the beginning
hello im dr
have we met
ive been in here before
take no offense trevor
i see many patients a day and have an awful memory
join the club
ambrose holds a penlight up to each of trevors eyes and nods
trevor you just had a seizure brought on by a severe migraine
things could be much worse
in the next few days you need to take plenty of aspirin stay out of the sun and make sure youve had at least eight glasses of water by the
time you go to bed at night
trevor just stares at dr
why dont you relax for the next couple of hours
barring any relapses you should be able to go home after that
ambrose looks a little confused
ambrose looks at the nurse who shrugs then back at trevor
uh we have no intern by that name here mr
listen ill be back in a few hours to check up on you meantime relax try not to move around too much
ambrose pats trevors shoulder congenially and walks out
there there trevor
get some sleep
trevor tenses when the nurse smiles
if you need anything give myself or any of the nurses a call okay
were dont tell me
ewere all here for you trevor right
go ahead say it
you know you want to
the nurse looks taken aback
what the hell are you talking about
trevor suddenly jumps up yanking electrodes and iv tubes from his body
the nurse is back to normal and very disconcerted
gooding lay back down trevor runs out of the woman mowing the woman down in his tracks
trevor rushes down the halls of the hospital nearly knocking down dr
trevor races as fast as his feet can carry him easily losing dr
trevor runs down a corridor through another doorway and into another wing of the hospital entirely
he arrives at the door to allisons office and throws it open
its actually a janitors closet
dressed in janitorial garb trevor bursts open the stairwell door and comes out on the roof
an old man in a johnnie is sitting in one of the chairs not too far away
an oxygen tube trails from his nose to an oxygen tank at his feet
wheezing okay ya caught me
he brings a cigarette to his lips and takes a long drag
least let me finish will ya
got one puff left
i dont work here
music to my ears
the old man lights a fresh cigarette with the one hes just finished
trevor turns to go back and theres allison standing in the doorway
i heard you were looking for me
is everything all right
am i glad to see you
changing his tone no
everythings not right
not at all
allison holds him
the old smoker turns and watches with curiosity
allison i think i did some very very bad things
i mean very bad
trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss
everybody does things they regret
you just couldnt remember doing these things and now you are so its a shock to the system
im telling you
you will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wifes death
maybe i wasnt responsible for the car accident
the old man calls out to trevor wheezily
ignoring him but im starting to think i was
i was going to
trevor turns to the old man
what do you want
wheezing who the hell are you talking to
trevor turns and allison is gone
vanished into thin air
trevor sits at the front of an empty bus rubbing his head
he stares at the spot where the creepy old lady knitting the babys bootie used to sit
he looks under the seat
there is nothing there
the hydraulics hiss as the bus comes to a stop
this is it mister
trevor gets up and hurries off giving the driver a cursory glance
the driver doesnt look at trevor as he speaks
have a good night now
trevor exits the bus
trevor steps out of the bus and faces the roman catholic cathedral
he ascends the steps
trevor sits in the booth across from the tiny screen behind which is a very tired priest who is still in his pajamas
i dont know what im doing here
im not even catholic
i just had to tell somebody
its like ever since my wife died i dont know what ive actually done or what ive imagined
but i do know if one tenth of whats happening to me is reality
ive done some really awful things in my life
things that ive
i guess ive blocked out
what things do you think youve done
so many sins so little time
for starters i was responsible for the death my wife who by the way was carrying my unborn child
that was so i could collect her eight million dollar estate
i think i killed several women i was having mindless sex with behind her back
trevor contd but i did those murders just for the hell of it
i think i made some kind of deal with the devil and now hes come to collect my soul
only hes decided to mess with my head first
how many hail marys do you recommend for that one father
trevor im sure you killed no one
you are very distraught over your wifes death and rightfully so
you did the right thing by confessing to me here tonight
and you should keep praying for the wisdom that will set your soul at ease
that being said you are still in a highly emotional state right now
it might do you some good to get some professional help
confess to them the way you confessed to me
in time youll probably find that the real killer has already been caught
or better yet
that these murders never happened at all
but i saw these women
i saw their mutilated bodies
i saw their ghosts
i just know it happened i can feel it
all youve got is the here and the now trevor
thats all anyone really has
maybe this will make things easier to understand
a man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that hes a butterfly
in time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams hes a man
and at the end of the day does it even matter
all these events youre describing
how can you be sure any of them really happened
but thats what i need
to be sure
to be absolutely sure
its okay son
there is but one truth
one thing you can be absolutely sure of
and that thing is this the priest moves closer to the screen
the priest begins to chuckle ominously
resisting the urge to scream trevor bolts out of the confessional
trevor rushes out of the confessional
the cathedral bell begins to clang
eardrums getting battered by the ringing trevor blocks his ears and rushes toward the exit coming face to face with a gargoyle blocking his path
though he speaks softly his voice is heard easily over the bell
still in the dark i see
who are you
this game is over do you hear me
i hear everything
and soon you will know everything
more than you ever wanted i can guarantee that
but i want you to think for a minute first
think about all youve seen
all the clues youve been given
pinhead opens his cloak revealing the darkness within
to trevors shock his sucked right into this void inside pinhead
trevor is thrust into the interior of his office building
everyones gone for the day
the only light is coming in from streetlights outside
trevor races past the cubicles running out into a hallway
he looks down one end then the other
where he sees an office light is on
he cautiously approaches the office
he looks inside
gwens hacked up body is strewn about the office
her arms are atop the filing cabinet
legs under her desk
ass on the copier
trevor hears someone coming
he looks down the hall to see a flashlight beam turn the corner blinding him
its bearer begins running toward trevor
trevor bolts the other direction heading for the exit
he pushes the door open and slams it behind him only hes not still outside yet
tawny lies on the bed dead tongue sticking out of her neck ribcage violated
trevor hears someone coming toward the bedroom can see the flashlight beam jittering as its bearer approaches
trevor rushes toward the window opens it and leaps out onto the fire escape
trevors about to climb down the fire escape when he is bathed in the flashlights beam from inside
trevor looks down and sees a garbage dumpster full of trash bags below
trevor sails down three stories and lands in the dumpster
he climbs out and runs to the street as fast as he can
he races down the sidewalk trying to get his bearings at the same time
hearing footsteps from behind trevor turns to see the stranger in the window not half a block behind trevor keeping trevors pace
the stranger stops as well
this has never happened before
trevor shouts down the empty street
his voice echoes off the darkened buildings
the stranger stands there
trevor begins walking toward him blood in his eyes
the stranger backs away
trevor bolts into a run and the stranger takes off running the other way
the stranger darts into an alley
trevor runs into the alley seeing no signs of the stranger
the end of the alley is pitch black
trevor hears something at the end of the alley
he grabs a broken bottle out of a garbage can and heads toward the darkness
trevors teeth are bared now
something glistens in the dark just before the razor sharp edge of a switchblade touches his left jugular
out of the shadows comes
what the fuck
tonight was supposed to be the night trevor
i couldnt believe you went through five dart games and didnt even joke about it
what the hell is going on
we were gonna be millionaires you said
nobodyd suspect a thing
i had never even met her
then you went and had that fucking car accident
bret you are making no sense whatsoever
i followed her trevor
i got to know her life
and what a boring one it was
gym nine a
trendy coffee shop noon bookstore one soap operas four oclock news five wait for trevor to come home
and wait and wait and wait
nine oclock get ready for bed
bret contd ten oclock fall asleep in front of the tv
she did that every day i followed her
every single day
while you were out fucking your concubines
every day i felt more and more bad for her man
and hated you more and more
trevor is absolutely speechless
then i find out youre having nooners with my gwen
that was all i could take
i didnt want to kill your wife anymore
i wanted to kill you
even before that little accident i decided to do it on the day wed set aside for her
bret presses the blade against trevors neck a little harder drawing a rivulet of blood
but now that aint gonna happen either
i fell in love with kirsty trevor
the day she died it was like my soul had been ripped from my body
not just because i lost someone i loved
its because the child inside her
bret then puts the knife to his neck
bret drags the knife across his own jugulars slicing them open
blood pours out of his smiling mouth
then something really weird happens
cuts begin to open up all over brets face and his hands
blood pouring to the ground in buckets
bret lifelessly falls into the pool of blood
before he can process whats just happened trevor hears a noise behind him and turns to see
several of those slithering sewer monsters coming toward him surrounding him
and behind them several silhouetted figures walking slowly toward him
we dont need three guesses to figure out who they are
panicking trevor reaches down and grabs the knife out of brets hand and readies himself for the inevitable attack when the blinding light from a police car illuminates the alley
first trevor notices the sewer monsters are gone
then the figures we thought were cenobites are actually lange and several police officers
lange looks disappointed
put the knife down
trevor does so
two cops rush up to trevor and one swings his baton down just over trevors eye crack
trevors nose has been bleeding
his eye is black and blue his lip cut
trevor looks out the window
the streets are deserted foreign
trevor looks at the rear view mirror
the cop staring back at him averts his gaze
trevor thinks he sees something crawl into the cops eye
lange sits next to the cop staring back at trevor
he takes out his antihistamine and sprays some up his nose
the doors burst open and the two cops lange escorts trevor the lobby is entirely deserted
trevor looks around
there are cups of coffee sitting on desks jackets thrown over backs of chairs
signs of a recently bustling workplace that has vacated
the cops hustle trevor up to a counter finger print him sit him in a chair
one of them sits at a computer terminal
despite being indoors both cops keep their sunglasses on
trevor alan gooding
trevor contd dont you guys ever take your sunglasses off
smash cut to the cops hurry trevor down a dank corridor toward a line up room
trevor sneaks a peek inside one of the rooms
inside the doorway two detectives have some hapless soul strapped to some odd looking electrical contraption
i told you i dont know
detective hits a button and a shock races through the hapless souls body
just then the other detective notices trevor looking in and slams the door shut
the trio comes to the line up room
trevor is shoved into the cramped booth like room with four other strange looking men who all stare at him
silence for a moment then a loud buzz is heard and the door on the other side of room opens
trevor follows the other men
the man just ahead of trevor turns to him
were all here for you trevor
trevor walks in with the rest of the gentlemen
hugging the nearest wall they go up a small set of stairs onto a stage
trevor hears langes voice overhead
stop and face the mirror
the five men do as theyre told facing a large two way mirror on the opposite wall
an awkward moment
the door to the room opens again and trevor turns leading the other men back through the anteroom
the cops hustle trevor out into the hallway
the next door down opens and out come two more detectives and
tawnys boyfriend the brute looking fit to be tied
he sees trevor and fills with rage
i hope they fry your ass mutherfucker
he lunges at trevor
it takes the detectives hes with and two more cops to keep him from pummeling trevor
as trevors lead away the brute begins to sob uncontrollably
to trevor got quite a fan club dont you hotshot
trevor sits at a tape recorder
lange sits across from him
for the last time
i honestly dont know how any of them died
lange stands squirting antihistamine in his nose
he nods at trevor and walks out
no sooner has the door closed when it opens again and givens walks in
givens gets right in trevors face
now i want you to tell me what you remember happening in your own words exactly the way you told detective lange
but this time i want you to make one small adjustment
givens whirls around revealing langes face on the back of his head
trevor thinks a moment
he is absolutely numb
he smiles a little insanely
i did it
i killed them all
still handcuffed trevor is escorted toward the detention area by the cops in the sunglasses
hes silently praying hell wake up from this one somehow
no such luck
trevor and the cops round a corner and theres lange running up to them
to the cops quick detour through the morgue boys
lange leads them to a set of elevators
thats right trevor
the timing was impeccable wasnt it
its been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body
just need you to id it for us
where was it
thats the weird part
it just magically turned up in the river less than thirty yards from where the car had landed
like somebody put it there while we werent looking
the elevator doors open and they get in
its a long ride down
trevor looks at the cops in the sunglasses
one of them takes his pair off
his eye sockets are empty
we can see brain
the cop cleans his shades then his mouth smiles at trevor before he puts the sunglasses back on
finally the doors open
lange unlocks trevors handcuffs and the cops push him out the door into a dark corridor
trevor looks back to see lange and the cops staring back at him
just keep walking trevor
you cant miss it
one of the cops waves bye bye to him
and with that the elevator doors shut
trevor turns around and faces the long corridor
he begins his hike towards its end where an ominous set of double doors awaits
he arrives at them and pushes them open
as soon as the doors open fluorescent lights flicker overhead illuminating two walls of metal drawers and between them a large slab of marble upon which rests a human form
covered with a sheet
he makes his way toward the body and stares at it
a low wheezing noise coming from a dark corner just beyond the slab distracts him
trevor looks and freezes when he sees the goat laying on the floor in a pool of blood
its still breathing
one of the goats slatted eyes is staring at trevor as if begging for mercy
a strange ripping noise is heard
the goat mewls in pain then its eye rolls up
the animals body begins to quiver as a tiny wound on its back widens spitting out streams of blood
trevor begins to back away as the wound stretches open giving birth to a rising form
he rises completely from the goat stepping out of the wound
he is red with blood for a second
then his skin and robe absorb the blood like a sponge
pinhead approaches trevor blocking him from the body on the slab
how is our little student doing
has he learned his lesson yet
i dont know who you are or what you want
i just want to know whats under that sheet
use your mind for something other than numbers dear trevor
think about people for a change
people other than yourself
like the women you slept with behind your wifes back
you were always so confident you had covered your tracks
always confident your wife actually believed your fervent denials
part of you must have known she would find out
flash back gwen has trevor on her desk riding him like a hobby horse
rain pounds against her window
kirsty sits inside the car looking up at the window eyes narrowing
jealousy arouses a spouses fury
and no mercy will be shown when that revenge is given
rubbing the baby thats growing inside her kirsty sits in front of the tv watching trevor having yet another romantic rendezvous with tawny
the tv screen dissolves to trevor in bed with yet another woman
that fatal bell begins to toll
with each peel the walls of the morgue shakes
its walls begin to rumble and crack
even a mind as narcissistic as yours must have wondered what unspeakable acts was your wife committing behind your back
low angle up at kirsty trevors lovely wife raising a rock above her
to camera goodbye you miserable sonofabitch
and slamming a rock down on us
back to whats under that sheet
you probably dont remember the night we played
your first year as husband and wife
flash back trevor and a very pregnant kirsty sit on their bed passing the cube back and forth
trevors the one with the magic touch
the cube begins to open in his hands
kirstys eyes light up as she watches
it must have seemed like we were uninvited guests crashing your little celebration
on the walls as shadows begin to flail in pain and panic
off screen screams are heard as blood begins to shower the walls of the bedroom
but someone was expecting us trevor
and everything went according to plan
we were about to come for kirsty
when we were offered a deal
we dont usually consider bargains but this one was too good to pass up
a tribute to the resourcefulness of a parent hellbent on protecting its spawn
the deal we were offered was this three more souls in exchange for the life of the unborn child inside kirsty
the three souls had already been picked out
needless to say we were very impressed
the lights dim
drawers behind pinhead begin to open
we see gwens body tawnys sages bonnies
two of your favorite companions most supple and delicious as you already know
and the man you had at one time conspired to kill kirsty with
until you found out she was with child
smash cut to quick images of gwen tawny and bret being rent to pieces by the cenobites screaming in vain
they were all real screamers too
we had a blast
and there was one more
youve seen many things you wished you hadnt
many nightmares from which you never awoke
they were all clues in our little puzzle
can you guess now trevor
can you guess the fifth soul chosen for us to torment in this little agreement
the lights flicker overhead reddening with each strobe
hundreds of those little sewer monsters come slithering out of the cracks in the walls racing toward trevor
he doesnt care
smiling welcome to the worst nightmare of them all trevor
pinhead grabs the sheet and whips it back
trevors jaw drops in disbelief
its trevors body
it is blue bloated and mutilated
the corpses skull has a massive crack in it
flash back kirsty sits across from lange who slides the cube across the desk towards her
open this and your problem will disappear forever
and no one will ever suspect you
trevor sits in the passenger seat in the same position we saw him in during his last flashback
only now it is clear the reason his head is resting on the baby blanket is to keep his brains from spilling out his split open skull
on kirstys hand holding his
it is now covered with blood
shhh its okay
the car goes off the bridge landing in the water
kirstys head breaks the surface
she watches the car sink into the river
back to trevor stares at his own dead body in utter disbelief
the sewer monsters begin crawling up his legs
the scream echoes over trevors dead self which seems so tranquil in contrast
hold on the corpse
after a beat the bells stop as does the rumbling and the cracking
the lights brighten
yes thats him
reverse angle on kirsty looking down at the corpse wiping her eyes
she looks over to the other side of the body where trevor and pinhead had been standing
where now detective lange and the coroner dr
ambrose had been standing
the two gentlemen look at each other
well i guess thats it then
thank you mrs
gooding i realize that must have been tough
lange escorts kirsty to the door
they exit but not before kirsty gives her late husband a parting glance
ambrose covers trevors body and looks off camera
lets get started folks
reverse on two other doctors who are busying themselves collecting instrument
allison and sage
they walk over to trevors body and get to work
sage sticks a needle in trevors arm
collecting ccs of serum
examining cranial fracture
allison at his side ambrose checks the wound on trevors head pauses to look inside trevors eyes
trevors pov ambrose closing the eyelid again
checking oral cavity for blockage
ambrose opens trevors mouth
and we have a winner
ambrose pulls a long black dead lamprey out of trevors mouth
looks at the slippery creature for a moment
looks like an eel of some kind
guess it was murder after all
yeah all we need is the eels motive
allison holds out a large freezer bag into which ambrose dumps the dead lamprey
i still dont get it
hes been missing for almost eight months
but this body hasnt been dead more than twenty four hours
makes you wonder what he was up to between the time he disappeared and when he died
allison walks right up to the corpses face
what do you say trevor
shivering allison what on earth possesses you to converse with cadavers
looking at trevors corpse its simple dr
what if there is no afterlife
what happens when we die
do we just stay stuck inside your bodies for eternity watching ourselves decompose
im not following this
well if thats the case
wouldnt you want someone to talk to you like a normal human being one last time
you two are creeping me out
and im a coroner
allison fixes a stray lock of hair on trevors forehead
quick cuts allison slipping a tag on trevors toe sliding trevors body into the morgue drawer her hand turning the lock on the drawer
lange sits across from kirsty who signs some paperwork on langes desk
i would have come in sooner but i had an important errand to run last night
out of town
figures youd find his body the minute i decide to go off somewhere
well you made it down here thats the important part
thank you for your patience mrs
she nods teary eyed
she slides the paperwork across his desk and gets up to leave
one last thing
when they found him he was holding something
not to get too graphic but they had to wrench it from his hand
lange reaches under his desk then stands revealing the cube inside a ziploc bag
lange and kirsty exchange a knowing glance
figured you might want it
that was my
last anniversary present to him
a token to remember him by now
she takes the cube
thank you detective
lange takes out his nasal sprayer as she walks out
she closes the door behind her and lange looks up at the closed door
he sticks the sprayer up his nose
kirsty walks toward the exit
on her way she passes a trash can
she discretely tosses the cube into it and rubs her hands together
the birds are chirping
the sun is shining
kirsty gooding walks out the door and takes a breath of fresh air
she skips down the steps of the police station toward the street
she stops in the middle of the sidewalk looking both ways
a shadow comes up behind her
its the stranger trevor had seen out his window
he grabs her shoulder startling kirsty
she turns to see larry ellis shit eating grin on his face
hes holding an eight month old baby
the one he was drawing
looking for someone kirsty
taking the baby you bet i was
kirsty plants a multitude of smothering kisses on the laughing child as a nanny comes up behind larry pushing a stroller
kirsty gently places the baby in it
to nanny okay were on our way
remember her lactose intolerance
ive stocked the fridge with lactaid
see you in a couple of weeks
youve got my cell number right
the nanny pushes the stroller away nodding waving good bye
larry smiles as he watches the baby go
daisy is getting so big
beat i still cant believe he was her father
kirsty smiles to herself
counselor can we not mention him anymore
can we just start spending his money instead
they walk slowly toward the curb
ive always wanted to go to madagascar
you mean the place with bats
theyre called flying lemurs
yeah that sounds like a real blast
they put their arms around each other
kirsty contd ive been thinking about it
this has to have been the best eight months of my life
larry sees a cab and rushes out to hail it
something out the corner of her eye scares kirsty
she turns to see lange standing there
you forgot something
lange holds up the cube she tossed out
kirstys expression falls
kirsty takes the cube
lange turns and kirstys shock theres givens face
on the back of langes head
givens smiles at her then walks away
she slowly walks toward the cab where larry has opened the door for her
after you my dear
kirsty slides into the cab looking at the cube in despair
larry slides in after her
to the cabbie airport please
he grabs kirstys knee
she just stares at the cube
larry contd contd whats up
larry looks down at the cube
it has magically risen from her palms and begun to rearrange itself in that way weve come to know and love so well
the cabbie looking back at the sight slowly slides the window between the driver and passenger compartments shut
as the cab drives off into traffic we see light flicker from within it
the cab passes a cathedral
