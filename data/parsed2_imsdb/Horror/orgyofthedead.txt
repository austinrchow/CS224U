orgy of the dead back by from his novel orgy of the dead copyright astra productions closeup of heavy riveted iron doors with round handles covered by spider webs
two giants wearing leopard skin shorts iron bicep bands and headbands pull the heavy iron doors open revealing the interior of the mausoleum
there is an ornate stone sarcophagus in the center of the room raised up on an altar
the back wall has a mantle with a bust of the virgin mary looking downward at the coffin
there is a round red window in the center of the wall
a ray of red light shines through the window illuminating the misty fog hanging in the air
the giants walk into the mausoleum
they lift the heavy stone lid off of the coffin revealing criswell
he is lying in the coffin on his back with his arms crossed over his chest and eyes closed
he is wearing black suit pants a white shirt a black ribbon like bow tie and a black satin cape
we see criswell narrator of our tale and sole ruler of the dark world now sitting upright slouching somewhat in his coffin glancing offscreen at his cue card
during his monologue each time criswell looks up at the camera a dramatic pause is inserted as he then looks back down at the cue card and searches for his
place in order to continue
i am criswell
for years i have told the almost unbelievable related the unreal and shown it to be more than a fact
now i tell a tale of the threshold people so astounding that some of you may faint

closeup of black raven with thick fog swirling around it another tombstone with a cherub like engraving on the front a plaque like grave stone on the ground with fog
swirling over it a skull and a long bone sitting on the ground by it criswell voice over this is a story of those in the twilight time
once human now monsters in a void between the living and the dead
monsters to be pitied monsters to be despised
criswell continuing a night with the ghouls
the ghouls reborn from the innnermost depths
of the world

consolidated film industries screenplay by from his novel orgy of the dead director of cinematography associate producers produced and directed by a convertible is driving along a desert road
long shots of the automobile driving are filmed in bright sunlight
the desert hills are clearly visible in the background with only a slight darkening to suggest day for night but the cars headlights are on so we clearly understand that
it is pitch black in the dead of night
bob and shirley are seated in the convertible driving through the night on a date
they are searching for an ancient cemetery
medium shots have a pitch black background and dark shadows across the car
shirley is leaning over in her seat toward bob who is driving
we sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery
lets turn back
its on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind
but does it have to be in a cemetery
you wouldnt understand
seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story
but therere so many wonderful things to write about bob
sure there are and ive tried them all
plays love stories westerns dog stories
huh now there was a good one that dog story all about interrupting but horror stories
why all the time horror stories
shirley i wrote for years without selling a single word
bob lets go of the wheel with his right arm and puts it around shirley who leans closer against him
my monsters have done well for me
you think id give that up just so i could write about trees or dogs or daisies
thats it ill write about my creatures who are pushing up the daisies
shirley looks up at bob and smiles
he tilts his head down and they kiss
your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters but it certainly doesnt hurt your art of kissing
my kisses are alive
whos to say my monsters arent alive
long shot of the car driving down the road cut back to medium shot of bob and shirley all of my books are based on fact or legend
thats perhaps why theyre more interesting and sell in the top spots
well fact or not i dont see how were going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight
i cant see a thing
lets turn back
theres an old cemetery on this road
ive been there before
long shot of car driving up a desert road with a sandy mountain in the background
im getting the jitters
lets turn back
bob takes his arm from around shirley and puts it back on the wheel
just as soon as i find a place wide enough to turn around
closeup of car interior dashboard
cut back to medium shot bob and shirley not so fast
we hear sounds of tires squealing on the road
closeup of car wheel racing along the road
cut back to medium shot bob and shirley desperately not so fast
closeup car pedals
bob steps hard on the brake then pumps the brake repeatedly
cut back to medium shot bob and shirley
shirley screams and hides her face with her hands
zoom in on a high dirt bank at the roadside then the screen swirls and spins quickly to suggest a dizzying automobile crash
bob and shirley are lying on their backs unconcsious on the ground
the ground is covered by scattered leaves
misty fog swirls over them
beat shirley wakes up and sits upright groggily
she looks around then looks down at bob
she moves toward him and cradles his head in her lap
cemetery is filled with fog
we see a large stone throne framed by ornate columns with an altar beneath it
there are tombstones in the background and skulls and bones on the ground
camera pans right across a small clearing to the mausoleum
it is said on clear nights beneath the cold light of the moon howl the dog and the wolf and creeping things crawl out of the slime
it is then the ghouls feast in all their radiance
the mausoleum doors creak open on their own and criswell quickly stalks out across the clearing hiding his face behind his long black cape which is held up with his
bent elbow against his face in dracula fashion
criswell vo continuing it is on nights like this most people prefer to steer clear of uh burial grounds it is on nights like this that the creatures are said
to appear and to walk criswell walks up the steps to the altar across the altar and then sits down on the stone seat
he then slowly lowers his cape from his face and regally looks off to the right at his cue card
the day is gone the night is upon us and the moon which controls all of the underworld once again shines
in radiant contentment
beat come forth come forth o princess of darkness
criswell repeatedly beckons slowly toward himself with his right hand staring across the clearing at the mausoleum
the princess of darkness is standing in front of the mausoleum
she walks into the clearing with an entrancing demeanor her arms outstretched straight in front of her
she is wearing a long black low cut dress with long open sleeves
the sleeves are lined with red and hang down a couple feet from her wrists
she walks slowly over toward criswells throne
the princess of darkness stands beside criswells throne crosses her forearms in front of her chest and bows toward him
he nods toward her
she reaches out and places her left hand on criswells right hand
time seems to stand still
not so the ghouls when a night of pleasure is at hand
criswell continues to hold the princess of darknesss hand and she looks at him seductively
if i am not pleased by tonights entertainment i shall banish their souls to everlasting damnation
the princess of darkness again crosses her arms in front of her chest and slowly bows to criswell
cut to shot of the full moon with dramatic cymbals crashing then back
and who is to be first
the princess of darkness claps twice summoning the first of the nights entertainers
these poor souls must dance for criswells approval
if he is pleased they can continue to entertain him for centuries but if not they will be banished to everlasting damnation by the all powerful criswell
long shot of the clearing
huge flames rise from the ground in front of the clearing
the indian girl enters the clearing and begins to dance
she is wearing a red native american style dress and headband
one who loved flames
her lover was killed by flames
she died in flames
the indian girl dance begins
the indian girl dances around for awhile then dances away into the foggy background
bob slowly wakes up and sits up
bob and shirley look around
the princess of darkness points dramatically toward the mausoleum and begins to speak without moving her lips
a marvel of filmmaking art
out of sync with picture one who prowls the lonely streets at night in life is bound to prowl them in eternity
the street walker dance begins
the street walker walks into the clearing wearing a pink dress and purple feather boa and beckons with her finger as if to say come here criswell
at the car accident scene with bob and shirley slow jazz music is audible from the nearby festivities in the cemetery
bob and shirley are still sitting on the ground looking toward the source of the music
ahh the curiousity of youth
on the road to ruin
may it ever be so adventurous
im so frightened
well we certainly cant stay here
it frightens me
silly theres nothing in there to be afraid of
then whats that music
thats what i want to find out
we have to get help
what help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night
somethings making that music
im not sure i care to find out what it is
dont worry ill be right beside you
what help will that do if something in there isnt dead
in a cemetery
i cant imagine anything dead playing that music
well its probably just the caretaker and thats exactly who we want to find
theyll have a telephone
bob helps shirley up from the ground and leads her into the thick bushes
criswell nods repeatedly smiling at the dancer in approval
the street walkers clothes have suddenly disappeared
bob and shirley creep beneath the bushes crouched down low
they reach the edge of the clearing where criswell and the princess of darkness are watching the street walker dance
could it be some kind of college initiation
its an initiation all right but not of a college as you and i know them
nothing alive looks like that
cant we get out of here
im not sure
what do you mean
im not sure myself
its just a feeling ive had since the crash
like i feel a cold chill all over
the street walker dances with a skeleton that is hanging by the door of the mausoleum
the street walker dance ends
i would see for approval the one who in life worshipped gold above all else
the princess of darkness points dramatically toward the mausoleum again to start off the next dance
the giants walk to the doors now wearing red and white horizontal striped miniskirts or ancient egyptian garb
they pull the iron doors open slowly and we see the gold girl dancer lying on her back on the altar inside
pointing toward the mausoleum look
theyll see you
the gold girl dancer rises slowly and seductively from the table then stalkingly dances out into the clearing
she is wearing a metallic gold tunic like dress
we see a shot of bob and shirley watching and suddenly the gold girls dress has disappeared
the gold girl dance continues
throw gold at her
the giants pick up a bucket of gold doubloons and begin slowly sprinkling them over the gold girl as she dances
she sits on the ground and reaches for the falling coins
the giants continue dropping gold coins on the gold girl
she picks up the gold coins rubbing them over her body in ecstasy
excitedly more gold
the giants continue to the delight of criswell
the gold girl tries to scoop all the scattered coins closer to her
impatiently more gold
the giants continue
criswell is thrilled and begins to laugh loudly
to the princess for all eternity she shall have gold
the princess of darkness laughs in acknowledgement then claps her hands twice commanding the giants to finish the ceremony
the giants walk toward the gold girl who is still on the ground playing with the gold coins and rubbing them on her body
the giants pick up the gold girl who resists trying to maintain contact with the gold
she reaches for it as they lift her up
closeup of a bubbling giant cauldron full of a substance that is supposed to look like gold
the giants dip the gold girl feet first into the cauldron submerging her entire body
a few seconds later the giants lift the gold girl out of the cauldron
her body is now entirely gilded and she is stiff
they lift her onto their shoulders carrying her like a board walking in front of criswells throne then back into the mausoleum laying her body on the altar
we see bob and shirley looking dismayed
and both couldnt help but remember a line from one of bobs stories a sudden wind howls
the night things are all about me
every shadow a beckoning invitation
i know i should think of other things of pleasant things but i cant
how can i think of other things of pleasant things when i am in a place surrounded by shadows and objects which can take any shape here in the darkness
any shape my mind can conceive
deep in the woods we see the wolf man and the mummy walking quickly
suddenly bob and shirley are grabbed from behind by the wolf man and the mummy
the wolf man and the mummy drag bob and shirley over to the clearing near criswells throne
the princess of darkness is now seated at criswells right side with him on his throne
bring em in
the princess of darkness stands and walks to the end of the altar below criswells throne then sits on the lower seat at the end of the altar and crosses
the wolf man and the mummy drag bob and shirley over to the center of the clearing to face criswell the sole ruler of the dark world
they are live ones
with audible tape hiss added yes master
live ones where only the dead should be
yes master and we caught them him and me
the mummy motions toward the wolf man
you shall both be rewarded
to princess my dear empress of the night put these intruders to the test
medium shot of princess of darkness
suddenly the princess of darkness is beside the throne again several feet from the seat at the foot of the altar but they are not yet one of us
happily a situation easily remedied
tie them that they may watch
cut back to long shot of the entire throne and throne altar
the princess of darkness is now seated again at the end of the altar
the wolf man and the mummy tie bob and shirley to very tall grave stones
cut to medium close shot of princess of darkness whose chest is heaving excitedly as she grips the handle of the long sacrificial dagger tucked into the belt at her
desperately to criswell fiend
to love the cat is to be the cat
criswell motions toward the princess of darkness who then walks back up onto the altar and then sits down beside criswell again
the cat girl dance begins
jovially a pussycat is born to be whipped
the cat girl dance ends
excitedly it will please me very much to see the slave girl with her tortures
cut to interior of the stone mausoleum
the ancient egyptian slave girl is chained from her wrists to a high hook on the wall
one of the giants pretends to whip her with a cat o nine tails
cut back to criswell
it pleasures me
the slave girl pulls with all her might and the chains suddenly pop off the hook
she then pushes the iron doors open and dances out into the clearing
the slave dance concludes
im so frightened
youve got a right to be
were trapped by a bunch of fiends
dont let them hear you
what can we do
i dont know
i just dont know
but dont give up
were not finished yet
shirley closes her eyes and sighs
easy shirley easy
panic wont do us any good
let me think
weve got to stall for time
im afraid ill faint
whatever you do dont do that
the camera zooms back and we see that the wolf man and the mummy are hiding behind bob and shirley
the wolf man has his hand up to his ear so he can hear what bob and shirley are saying
the wolf man and the mummy then creep over toward criswells throne
the wolf man whispers into the princess of darknesss ear while the mummy and criswell watch
the princess of darkness gets up from the throne and walks over to shirley
the princess of darkness unbuttons shirleys blouse then marks shirleys abdomen with a red blood
cross using her long sharp fingernail
the princess of darkness pulls her long dagger out of her belt and raises it staring into shirleys eyes
suddenly criswell yells the princess of darkness pauses and looks back at criswell
let her continue to learn
the time is not yet right that they should join with us
the princess of darkness reluctantly puts her dagger back in her belt and tucks shirleys blouse back in
the princess of darkness walks back to criswells throne
he pulls a human skull out from behind his seat
and what is this
a symbol master
what kind of symbol
she loved the bull ring and the matador
she danced to their destruction
now she dances to her own destruction
her dance is of skulls
the princess of darkness takes the skull from criswell and throws it dramatically into the clearing
the mexican dance skull dance ensues
she came to us on the day of the dead
el dia de los muertos
a celebration in her country
her dance has pleased me
the princess of darkness snaps her fingers starting the with the loss of her lover this one cast herself into the volcanos fire
a couple times during the dance there are abrupt cuts to stock footage of a rattlesnake in a bright daylight shot in tall dry grass
looks like it was from a documentary she was
as i said a worshipper of snakes and of smoke and flames
oh yes a religion of sorts
it would seem so master
hawaiian dance continues then cut to the mummy and the wolf man
i dont like snakes
i remember the one cleopatra used
cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue and those two sharp fangs
youd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop
hell it killed her
in agreement aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn
hawaiian snake girl continues to dance
we had lots of snakes in my ancient egypt
slimy slinky things
when i was alive they were the things nightmares were made of
the hawaiian dance ends
she pleases me
permit her to live in the world of the snakes
audible cue card flip continuing after finding his place on the next cue card now i will talk
to the wolf man
and the mummy
as you wish master the princess of darkness motions for the wolf man and the mummy to come
he wants us
what do you suppose for
did you do something to get us into trouble again
did you howl off key at the moon again
i cant remember doing anything wrong either
we better go before we make him mad
the wolf man and the mummy walk over to criswells throne
apprehensively we are your servants master
the wolf man bows to criswell
of course you are
the wolf man and the mummy crouch in fear as they face criswell
have we in some way made you angry master
you know better than that
we dont know of anything master
then why do you shake so
its not often an emperor like you calls on creatures like us
well rest easy im not angry with either of you
the mummy sighs in relief and the wolf man nods
then it is some service you desire of us
you are the keepers of the damned
you two know them all
and i am tired of this usual type of entertainment
a decided change
is soon gone
the princess of darkness points up at the full moon
there is little time left for the remainder of the evenings pleasures
the princess of darkness gets up from the seat at the end of the altar and walks around beside criswells throne
yes yes yes i know all that
at the first sight of the morning suns rays we must be gone
i suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon
it would seem so master ahh but i declare there is still time for some thing
there are one or two which should complement the nights entertainment master ahh good
then i will see them
dismiss the rest
yes sir master
bobs hands are wiggling trying to loosen the rope binding his wrists behind his back around the stone column
the ropes are coming loose
i am its our only chance
nothing is worth your life
my guess is if we dont take the chance pretty soon were not going to have much life left anyway
im so frightened
hold on just a little longer shirley
be careful oh please be careful
well never get out of here alive i know it
i just feel it
yes i feel it in my bones
youre talking nonsense
oh no im not
these heathens probably have an open grave for us
they wouldnt dare put us in the same grave or would they
i should hope not
i hate you
yes that sudden
if it werent for you we wouldnt be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this
its all your fault
dejected and i thought you loved me
the princess of darkness is leaning over covering her mouth and whispering into criswells ear looking over her hand back at shirley
i perhaps have other plans for such a pretty one
no matter i will tell you when and if you may have her
the princess of darkness crosses her forearms and bows to criswell
the wolf man informs me that the next one is the woman who murdered her husband on their wedding night
now she dances with his skeleton
the skeleton dance begins
the skeleton dance girl wearing a white dress and long wedding veil comes into the clearing with a skeleton
she dances with the skeleton then dances in the clearing for criswell
the skeleton dance concludes
to shirley have you not enjoyed the evenings festivities
shirley is silent and looks downward
ahh that will soon change when you become one of us
the wolf man leans back and howls
he tilts his head back so far his fake rubber wolfman mask comes up and you can see his skin at the bottom of his neck aaaaaaaaahhggggghhhhhhhhhhhhh
it would seem that the wolf man would have you for his own
i have promised both the wolf man and the mummy a reward
it could be that you are that reward
you need not worry
not just now anyway
leave her alone you fiend
fiend is it
you will not be so fortunate
your existence will cease within moments
no one wishes to see a man dance
looking at shirley and you my dear will entertain for centuries to come
if i could get my hands on you
oh you could do nothing
to shirley i can save you much pain
leave her alone i tell you
to shirley i do not joke in my proposal
she is to be mine
it is so spoken
the princess of darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain
beat yet i am inclined for one as lovely as you to be more lenient
i have but to touch you with my finger and it would mean the end of you all over quickly and painlessly
i repulse you
it seems you have chosen your own fate
live with it
i should say die with it
bob looks down somberly then looks over at shirley
ive got the ropes loose now
ive got my hands free
be careful dont change your expression too much
they must not catch on
what can we do against them
i dont know yet
well just have to watch our chance
when it comes ill know what to do i hope ill know what to do
i still dont know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you
put it on heavy
my old boyfriend tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this
at least hes got brains
ill bet he sleeps with all the lights on
cut to shot of the mummy talking to the wolf man i could make her another cleopatra
ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn
without the snake of course
ahh she will be yours
at your discretion
but first i desire more entertainment
the moon is almost gone
ahh there is yet time
at the first sight of the mornings rays light
getting annoyed i know the laws of the night
i state there is still time for yet another
forcefully i would have time for my own pleasures
angrily your own pleasure comes only after mine when i desire it
i am the sole ruler of the dark world
there is no one to challenge my authority here
my word is the law all powerful
no one is to challenge that authority no one
is that understood
it is my command
i understand master then see that it does not happen again in the penalty of everlasting despair
now are there others
there are others
well then let us proceed
the princess of darkness snaps her fingers three times summoning the zombie dance girl
she lived as a zombie in life so she will remain forever a zombie in death
the zombie dance girl dances
the zombie dance concludes
the moon sinks lower into the hills
we must hurry to the finish
i will decide the conclusion
impatiently you had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session
interrupting then cancel my order
the moon is almost gone
there is yet time
dont you want your own pleasure
oh if there is only time
hahh there is always time
all in good time
there is always time
you shall have your pleasure
decree looking at shirley all others were but infinitessimal bits of fluff compared to her toward the dancer this one would have died for feathers furs and fluff
and so she did
the fluff dance girl dances for approval
the fluff dance ends
criswell looks over at the princess of darkness
your pleasures of course
you may take her now
is there time
you better hope there is
thank you master
now hurry hurry
i will watch
your desires may be my pleasure also
our fitting climax to an evenings enter tainment
the princess of darkness begins ceremoniously dancing with her long sacrificial dagger slowly moving toward shirley gazing back at criswell seductively
she finally gets to shirley and cuts the button off of shirleys shirt which was so tight it was about to burst open anyway
she unsnaps the front of shirleys bra
bob sees his chance and makes his attempt at a move merely stepping forward
he is instantly hammer fisted on the back of the neck by the wolf man and falls down unconscious
the princess of darkness raises her long dagger high above shirleys head
but suddenly the sun rises it is already high overhead and the night creatures lose their power
the princess of darkness clings to shirleys arm as she slowly sinks down to the ground losing all strength
the camera pans around showing shirley and bobs faces then back to the ghouls all of whom have turned to steaming skeletons
only their clothing and bones remain
quick zoom in on criswells throne
criswells steaming skeleton still sits surveying the cemetery wearing his cape
at the clearing in the woods near the car wreck bob and shirley are lying on their backs on the ground just as they were after the crash before they
got up to investigate the strange music that led them to the ghouls
there are two doctors examining bob and shirley
in the foreground we see a reporters shoulder and hands
he is writing down details of the accident in a small paper pad
easy miss everythings gonna be alright
hes right here beside you
hell be alright too
the reporter walks around and crouches beside shirley and doctor and continues writing in his pad
a newspaper photographer crouches in the foreground to get a shot of the accident scene and victims
where are they where did they go
they tried to kill me
whats this you say
who was going to kill you
the ghouls they all turned into skeletons
take it easy miss
what she needs is a good rest
its true i tell you its true
they all turned into skeletons
she she cut me here
shirley points to her abdomen where the princess of darkness had made the x with her fingernail
nurse crouches down and pulls out a length of medical tape then hands it to the doctor
she cuts another piece of tape but the doctors dont realize this and leave her hanging
probably was bruised in the crash
you know you two were very lucky
i love you bob
i really do
theres nothing to forgive
it was all a dream
you love me then
of course i do
the doctors put shirley onto a stretcher while the photographer takes more pictures
they put her into the back of an ambulance
then after the doctor listens to bobs neck with a stethoscope bob just gets up and walks into the back of the ambulance
as it is with all the night people they are destroyed by the first rays of the sun
but upon the first appearance of the deep shadows of the night and when the moon is full they will return to rejoice
in their evil lust and take back with them any mortal who might happen along
criswell is back in his coffin sitting upright
yes they were lucky those two young people
may you be so lucky
but do not trust to luck at the full of the moon when the night is dark
make a wide path around the unholy grounds
of the night people
who can say that we do not exist can you
but now we return to our graves and you pointing at audience may join us soon
criswell reclines back into his coffin crossing his arms and returning to the slumber of the undead
