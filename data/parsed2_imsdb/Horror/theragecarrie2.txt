written by rafael moreu i wish that i could write you a melody so plain that would save you dear lady from going insane bob dylan tombstone blues music up
slow sad ethereal
perhaps even eerie
on a sea of red filling the frame
a crimson ocean without waves or ripples
a thick housepainters brush dips in revealing its paint
the brush is extracted paint dripping like congealing blood
follow the brush to reveal
a white wall where the brush is moved horizontally leaving a thick continuous stripe until the paint thins out
a womans hand plunges the brush back into the paint can then takes up creating the stripe again painting the wall until it reaches pleated drape and doesnt stop
a window and another drape receive the same treatment before the brush is re dipped
a sad eyed basset hound sits on the floor watching a bit perplexed
this is walter and even he knows this is weird
the dog looks over to
standing next to him also watching
this is rachel
dark haired in a plain dress
her large eyes are welling on the verge of tears
the brush is dragged across the wall hits a wooden picture frame moves across a cheap oil painting of a pastoral forest scene and over the other edge of the
another angle takes in the red line five feet high parallel to the floor extending around a modest living room
painting the line is barbara lang in her thirties yet worn haggard she hasnt slept in a while
the precision of her work her concentration her focus as the line runs across a wall and into a corner is more than a little frightening
mommy barbara hears nothing says nothing just wipes a paint drip
this is a very careful line
momma come play with me
in my room
but her mother keeps painting across a door
right now mommy okay
barbara looks at her or rather through her
and continues her task
rachel steps forward tugs on her moms i got a idea we could and gets splat right in the face with the brush a toy ambulance sits on the floor
rachels tiny hand deliberately presses a button on it
the toy responds with a wheep whe ep siren then if you need help dial nine one one
if you need help dial nine one one
rachels hand struggles to reach the buttons to dial
barbaras still painting the wall in the background
its my mom
shes doing some
some wrong things
shes doing wrong things so and you should come
a light rain falls on an ambulance sitting next to a police its dashing red lights cruiser with its doors flung open
splash over the umbrella carrying neighbors in pajamas and robes watching
workers drag a struggling barbara across a lawn her hands in plastic restraining cuffs
a wet rachel stands by a kneeling police officer holding a poncho over her head
rachel are you okay
she keeps staring off watching her mother being stuffed into the ambulance
she starts towards her but the officer holds her back
honey she just has to go somewhere to get some rest so shell feel better
as the ambulance pulls away rachel catches a glimpse of her mother in the rear windows watching her
is your dad around
whens he get home from work
i dont have a dad
the policeman collects himself
then were going to take you someplace nice with a family a really nice family till we get all this sorted out
she breaks free races into
where she runs down the entrance hall
behind her outside as the policeman runs toward the front door it slams by itself right in his face
follow rachel as she rushes through the living room and down a hall
another door slams shut behind her
she spins frightened by the door that closed behind her
to her left
a window crashes shut startling her
then like a wave moving in a circle around her another window bangs down a door slams shut another window
scared rachel backs into where she finds walter huddling and cradles him in her arms
the closet door swings shut sealing her off from the world
in the dark rachel is in a fetal position on the floor dry eyed in shock curled around her puppy
theres the far off sound of pounding on a door
rachel now is curled in bed around walter also now a far more senior dog
shes enmeshed in tangled white small tattoos come into view a delicate angel with broken wings on her ankle
a small egyptian ankh is etched on her shoulder blade
wrapped around her upper arm is an elegant thorn band encircling a heart either protecting or imprisoning it
theres a knock on her bedroom door
c et up
youre gonna be late again
she rolls over blinks awake
shes beautiful with sensual lips framed by raven black hair
a super burns in the usual teenage mess clothes strewn everywhere
a poster of jim morrison reads no one here gets out alive
rachel stands before her dresser mirror in a ratty bathrobe putting on a small nose stud
she dons her daily armor slipping on multiple earrings
applying kohl around her eyes
shrugging on a t shirt with a photo of sharon tate captioned manson sucks
disheveling her long black hair
scooping up walter she kisses him takes him to an open ground floor window
and gently lowers him outside
its not the home rachel lived in with barbara
this one is run down and in the section of town where people have cars in their yards theyve abandoned tinkering with
the lawn is overgrown theres broken glass on the street
the crammed eat in kitchen of the wallace house
emilyn s is ironing a waitress uniform on the counter
a groggy boyd s enters hes a trucker and looks like one
he goes straight for the refrigerator
boyd and his wife emilyn have taken in rachel as a foster kid to augment their income
rachel is alone at a formica table eating cereal
boyd looks at his
graveyard shift again
was the dog in the house last night
hes allowed in the morning
head in refrigerator daytime yes nighttime no
weve been over this ground
i only brought him in this morning
were out of a lot of things
i heard dog noises last night
when i was trying to sleep
walter was not in the house last night
shoots rachel a look you watch that voice in this house
while youre here youll respect her as your mother and treat her as such
lowers her eyes mumbles sorry
she picks through her cold cereal in silence
your moms making progress isnt she on the new medicacions the tricyclics
may i be excused
without waiting for a reply she stands and gathers the bowl
casually a routine and you should take that thing outta your nose
dont you have enough holes in your head
as she turns away rachel makes a face but replies
rachel stands outside clad in a long dark overcoat with a black backpack
walter sits next to her behind a fence
a yellow school bus pulls up
on walter bummed
a gaggle of young kids in faded denims and pastels
rachel moves to the back sits with lisa parker who could be her younger sister also dressed goth black lace and metal
lisa has a heart thorn tattoo around her arm like rachels
she opens her mouth and sounds come out
the sounds are words
lta gives her a cheshire cat grin
whats wrong fcscer dad bein a pain again
why are you so weiz
o i look any different
do you look any
oh my gawd
you did it
youd never believe me if i told you
im bringing him to lunch
all will be revealed in due time
rachel pulls out a worn anne rice paperback from her ba gives it to lisa
i love you too
simultaneously they bite their thumbs then press them together a pantomime of blood sisters
arnie a skinny pimply stoner plops into the seat behind them sticks his head on their seatback smiles full braces
hi there gruesome twosome how bout a threesome
ignoring him to rachel lunch
meet me in the parking lot
a modern windowless school shrouded in mist
its beautiful in an eerie fall of the house of usher way
hung over the concrete entrance is a large bedsheet banner with oversized red lettering the school mascot a scrappy bulldog wearing a crown tilted at a rakish angle is also
drawn on the banner
fade in knots of students like spectral figures
the two major school cliques are
on the front steps
land of burnouts step kids metalheat s skateboard junkiei and other lost souls
a stoner kid kicks his skateboard up and catches it
his buddy follows suit and misses suffering the embarrassment of watching his board shoot down the steps whose metal rail separates freak hall and
a courtyard with concrete tables where the schools royalty hold court
the cleancut patio people are the jocks student government types and others who have no idea what it is to be alone on a saturday night
at the patio is a pack of muscular jocks in football letter jackets reading bulldogs some sport caps marked dawgs theres jesse ryan handsome longish hair a young eddie vedor
if eddie ever played football
next to him is
mark bing good looking with a body like a fist
behind them arrayed around a concrete table are the large doltish brad hearty rich boy chuck and the arrogant eric
chucks looks over a plain looking girl on the patio
aside low hey mark the girl over there how many if i do her
i did her last week i only got five
she was having a bad hairday
a group of patio girls sit at another table
among them is monica a stunning brunette amy a cute redhead and tracy an icy blonde who could spend all day checking her makeup
jesse looks over
tracy graces him with a smile and turns away
mark leans in to jesse
tracy she wants you man
jump her bones
whats the matter with you shes got an ass stamped made in heaven i dont know you ever have a conversation with her
its like talking down a well
she only wants me cause im on the football team
you want her to want you cause of your dazzling personality
look you want someone to talk to you got us
h you screw
rachel and lisa hop off and walk past the patio
chuck watches lisa pass
woof coyote date
thats harsh man keep it down
whats a coyote date
when you wake up in the morning and shes sleeping on your arm and the only way to get up is to wake her
so you gnaw your arm off instead
brad snorts a laugh
a goateed english teacher nods to both camps as he passes
hello montagues hello capulets
a bell goes off and the students start filing into school
lisa waves the tips of her fingers to rachel bye bye
rachel looks over catches a glimpse of jesse across the line of demarcation
for a piece of a second it seems as if hes looking back
she drops her head walks away
the english teacher strolls among the students desk
rachel is in social siberia sitting in the back
okay then how many saw the movie
a show of hands all the girls some of the boys
now how many read the play
a few tentative hands including jesse
i thank you for your honesty but i am saddened
id like to think were here to study william shakespeare not worship at the altar of leo dicaprio
i was going to calk about the language
but since you havent z d the language lets talk about the plot
sighs of relief romeo and juliet a tale of two lovers meant for each other pulled apart by their families society and some might say by fate
why is it that we are so moved by love stories that end with separation
the student s faces are blank
what are some other stories with this theme
how about dr
amy timidly raises her hand
you meair like in dumb and when the girls husband showed up
the teacher surrenders to the inevitable
perhaps at some level we know that lauren hollys husband aim to show up
i dont know that i believe in it
believe in what
jesse looks at her pensive
well then youve got bigger problems than passing this crass
raises his hand love is fifteen seconds of squishing noises
jesse overhears tracy as she nods at rachel whispers to amy
who would love her
do you think that all love stories are tragedies
i mean unless they die at the same time all lovers are eventually separated by death
well then romeo and juliet isnt a tragedy because the only way they could really be together was in death
nods at rachel a foul cynic most cliche
turns to jesse a true romantic how refreshing
kids scoff at jesse but rachel eyes jesse struck by this side of him
the bell rings and arnie leads the exodus
next assignment brave new world the book not the tv movie
a stone faced lisa folds a note places it within her hallway locker jammed to the brim with books a photo of fiona apple and a nine inch nails sticker
are plastered on its door
students pour out the doors some heading to a row of outside lockers
rachel appears searching for lisa
lisa walks as if moving through extremely dense air hugging the wall as students pass without acknowledging her
rachel looks around the students sees a girls head from behind realizes it isnt lisa
lisa ascends several flights still brushing the wall exiting onto the
she walks past a trio of students smoking near the roofs edge
without slowing or blinking an eyelash lisa simply
a girl turns in the direction of lisas disappearance
did you see that
lisas face smashes into the windshield which cracks in a spider web pattern
blood fills the web
the sound of a droplet hitting car vinyl then drops splatter red on our standing in the lot is rachel
she stares in horror at lisa sprawled on the dented hood of a parked car her head a bloody mass nestled in the shattered windshield
and rachel opens her mouth but the scream bottled inside catches in her throat which causes
to ulq open behind her like dominoes banging in a wave away from her startling kids near them
bang as a door marked guidance counselor swings open and
sue snell whips around in her seat late s but with the eyes of someone whos been to hell and back
a young girl is seated before her for counseling
in her doorway is the school principal chaos in the hall behind him
youd better come with me a girl just killed herself in the lot
kidsrush in to see others move away
next to the car with lisas body is rachel
slowly tentatively without knowing what shes doing rachel runs her hand along the cars hood coating her thumb with blood
sue pushes her way through the crowd sees a stunned rachel puts an arm around her shoulder
come with me
lets back off
lets back away
pull back to see the widening circles of shock as the students of bergen high realize whats just occurred
a snow dome with a forest scene
rachel is in a chair her face an ashen mask staring at the dome on the desk
sue offers a glass of water rachel doesnt take it
sue leans on the desks edge
low intimace was she a friend
this is a place where you can calk about it
but if you need to im always here
sue takes rachels hand
rachel looks up at her eyes welling
bur she doesnt cry
let it out
shakes her head i never cry
she was so happy this morning
i dont understand
why would she the intercom box squawks ms
snell would you please come to the principals office
snell please come to the principals office
you stay here as long as you need to
sue moves to the door and exits
leaving rachel alone looking all of five years old
a medium sized office standing room only
the principal addresses sue and his staff as he hands out sheets of paper
the board of education has given us these procedures to follow
i want every teacher to read this aloud in their classrooms in ten minutes
do not digress or become overly emotional or dramatic
his voice under
a door bangs open as rachel runs out and down the steps
then ill ask you to identify any students who may have been lisa parkers close friends and therefore may require additional counseling
he scans the faces of his troops
we want a return to the normal life of the school
what do we not want
everybody got it
nods all around
then lets go with the drill
a teacher reads from the prepared statement to her class
one of our students died today
a forest glimpses of rachel running through the trees
sue at a microphone reading from a sheet of paper we will observe at exactly two p
her voice emanates from an intercom box high on a classroom wall
students bow their heads
a moment of silence
th rachel running branches tearing at her clothes
lisa parker may be gone but she will not be forgotten by her friends
eric surreptitiously passes mark something under a desk a large pocket notebook
a girl picks her nose
a cy yawns
another boy absently fiddles with his crucifix as he reads a comic book
a girl and a boy whisper to each other then stifle a laugh
she will not be forgotten by her fellow students her teachers and her school
rachel sits on rock in a clearing observing her own moment of silence
she looks at her hand
its trembling and still covered with lisas blood
th a sign identifying it as such
a fenced in complex of spooky victorian and queen anne buildings
chel sits removing her nose stud and earrings as the bus approaches the hospital
rachel is washing off her makeup which runs black into the institutional porcelain sink
she changes into a white cotton shirt
the dilapidated room is a statue garden of catatonics and depressives seated on vinyl furniture before a static filled t
patients shuffle past like motorized corpses
barbara lang now in her s sits on a couch with a transformed rachel
barbara is lucid and beaming at her
yes baby i really am feeling so much better
i feel so good on the inside i must be glowing on the outside
you look great mama
lord you come all the way out here we cant keep talking about me
how are you
i wane to hear every little thing im missing
rachel takes a deep breath working extra hard to seem happy and well adjusted today
things are really great
last night i um i had this slumber party with some girlfriends
and this morning mrs
wallace made us all pancakes before school
the wallaces sure are a nice family
her smile falters oh they are
a nice family

holds out her arms come here baby
she gives her daughter a big hug
now you listen to me the doctors say im doing well

that means someday soon you and i are gonna be eating crepes for breakfast lunch and dinner
for the first time rachels smile is genuine
that would be so great
holds her at arms length oh i look at you remembering what you were like at five at ten
decides not to go down a sad path all i need is a little loving care for these grey hairs and well make up for all the time weve lost
ooks at a wall clock
barbara cont d now you get going before youre late for work
rachel stands before glass doors reinforced with chicken wire waiting to be buzzed out
the nurse on the other side is on the phone
rachel turns and sees graffiti reading klnq of hell she cocks her head noting the capitalized letters reveal a hidden message sll
a smiling teenage girl wears a nightgown with a large wet spot where shes soiled herself without warnin she lets
out a arcing e
rachel wheels and pounds on the door
let me out
the door buzzes and she shoves through
a restaurant bar decorated with the bulldog insignia on a football helmet
the rear end of a young woman in tight jeans walking away
backfield in motion
pull back to pub decor with football paraphernalia everywhere bulldog lamps and paw prints painted on the floor
the bars packed with local businessmen
jesse mark and the other bulldogs are in a corner booth
middle aged bearded wailer with half his face bur ss arred approaches

eric leans over to mark urgently whispers and the two of them move to
nervous jumpy when lisa asked me to lunch she was actin like were on the road to marriage or something
i told her to wake up she was just a pump a nut
and she freaked and took a header
and now i freakin

the waiter sets a pitcher of soda and cups on the table
at the bar mr
stark a rotund lawyer in his s takes a pitcher of beer from the bartender
i dont see nuthin
stark strolls to the booth with the pitcher in hand
he sits hiding the pitcher below table level
stark winks takes marks empty cup and fills it with beer below the table
great game last week
all of us on the town council are awful proud
he hands mark the cup under the table and takes jesses cup
the players smile at each other
so the bulldogs bringing home the state championship again this year
were gonna crush carlin friday and make it seven years in arow
thats what i like to hear
offers a toast to jesse its good to be king
a crash of metal as the lock is cut off lisa parkers locker with a pair of boltcutters held by sheriff kelton s a former bulldog himself
the principal and sue stand nearby
opening the locker kelton finds lisas note
as he pulls it out something falls from the note
what is it
looks like a suicide note
bending to retrieve and a stub
rachels at her job an island in the middle of a parking lot
she wears her walkman listening to music
across the street is a type store
arnie che sweet natured stoner mops the floor
he waves to rachel who gives him a half hearted wave back
photos glide out of the developing machine
rachel pulls the pictures out stops dead when she sees theyre shots of lisa with rachel laughing
lisa with rachels dog
rachels finger tenderly slides along lisas face
shes shocked to find a picture of lisa and eric his arm draped around her in the backseat of a car
lisas holding the camera at arms length
jesses car pulls up outside
mark sits beside him
she peels off her headphones
sorry didnt scare you did i
rachel turns slides lisas pictures into an envelope
mark checks her out likes what
he sees nudges jesse
she nods surprised he knows shes alive much less knows her name
the true romantic
mark leans over jesse his voice low now intimate
so rachel there were some pictures lisa took
they have what you might call sentimental value
she just stares at him
mark pulls a twenty from his wallet
twenty bucks cover it
what do you mean
ill go thirty
theyre not your pictures
well its not like shes gonna be picking them up is it
rachel turns away
jesse glares at mark
tries a different tack rachel why dont i come by when you get off and you know take you for a ride
jesse cocks an ear for her reply but she doesnt answer
cmon i dont bite
not unless you want me to
i dont think so
cause im a dyke
he knows shes putting him on and bores holes into her
lets go jess
the car pulls away mark glances in the rearview mirror at rachel framed like a target
low to himself bitch
ill show you funny
on rachel watching them go
seconds later a sheriffs cruiser pulls up
he holds out lisas photo stub
rachel takes it sees the name her eyes widen
a star filled sky hangs above the towns makeout spot a hill overlooking bergen
mark and chuck stand outside a car sipping beers
jesses car a blue g
a is several yards away with foggy windows
jesses on top of tracy
he pulls away from her
she pulls her top down sits up
im sorry its not you
you should save your energy for the game anyway
jesse opens the door stands outside tucking in his shirt
mark and chuck make a crude humping gesture to jesse
he hesitates then nods at them
mark pulls out the scoreboard and enters jesses name with tracys and the number
he shoots he scores
on tracy in the front seat using the rearview to adjust her makeup pleased with what she sees
she glances at jesse as he re enters on the drivers side
what are you thinking about
i asked what not who
doesnt it bother you that a girl offed herself today
she wasnt anybody
i mean i didnt know her
you know i still dont have a date to marks party friday
she leans over and nibbles on jesses ear
he pulls away forces a smile and turns the ignition
smash as a dish drops onto the floor
rachel is at the sink doing dishes
she crouches to retrieve the broken plate
we pan along the chorus line of dishes glasses and silverware on the counter as the metronome of the sink faucets drip drip drip and the micro explosions of the
soap bubbles in the water intensify to deafening levels
tight on a spoon atop the counter which suddenly begins dancing
pots and pans on a hanging rack start rattling
a rumble as more dishes and utensils vibrate and rattle as if by a paranormal force
but as rachel casually straightens up and looks out the window its revealed its only
boyd driving a large semi truck pulling alongside the tiny house
its engine shuts off
and the spoons and dishes stop vibrating
singsong to herself daddys home
she walks to her bedroom and closes the door
boyd goes to shut the open fence and walter the basset hound scurries past him and into the street
come back here mutt
aw good riddance
and he closes the gate
rachel lays in bed staring at the ceiling
boyd knocks on her door
your dog got out
jesses driving alone wiping tracys lipstick from his cheek
s in her overcoat over her longjohns
she looks down the road and blanches as she sees walter trotting towards
the road in front of him a two lane blacktop with cars and trucks streaming by at high speed
and she breaks into a run
walter looks back starts running this is all fun for him
theres the low bleat of a trucks horn and then
the high piercing squeal of a wounded animal
in the road walter laying flat keening in pain
she runs to him and in one continuous motion scoops him into her arms
rachel in the middle of the two lanes
she turns as
she stumbles under the dogs weight tries flagging down a car
it speeds past dangerously close
another set of lights
but the car passes blaring its horn
she spins around
is bearing down on her
she holds her ground
the cars windshield cracks crazes as if it hit with a sharp fierce projectile
the car lays down rubber as it screeches to a halt
jesse is at the wheel
sees through the crazed windshield rachel splattered with dogs blood
he gets out stares at hiswindshield shaken up groping for some explanation
rachel staggers up to him holding a shivering mass of fur
oh my god
rachel sits next to him hugging the dog
its my fault
he should have been in bed with me
everythings gonna be all right
his voice is not entirely convincing
through the spidered windshield the cars headlights pierce the night
a craftsman bungalow which serves as a vets hospital
the only light is over a female vet in her bathrobe tending to walter on a shiny examining table
there are runnels on both sides of the table for the blood
rachel and jesse stand nearby
his names walter
will he be all right
the vets intensely focused on inserting an i
into the dog
you two had best wait outside
best things to let her do her work
jesse gently guides rachel away who keeps looking back at her dog
rachel and jesse on a couch in the darkened room
shes rocking herself caked with blood
he tries to comfort her
your dogs gonna be okay
she nods unconvinced
god i almost roadkilled you
are you sure youre all right
they hear a muffled pmt from the vet in the examining room
jesse tries to take rachels mind off it
that tattoo on your arm its pretty
hurt a lot when you got it
you know like the song says you hurt yourself to see if you can still feel
for making you no problem
glad to help you know
and im sorry about your windshield about your car
how bizarre was that huh
anyway wasnt your fault
you can be sorry for things that arent your fault
the vet enters drying her hands
rachel sits up bracing herself for the bad news
jesse puts an arm around her seat back getting ready to hold her
walters banged up pretty bad lost quite a bit of blood but hes gonna make it
can i see him
come back tomorrow any time after eight
your typical i
jesses car is parked in the lot
rachels at the sink washing the dogs blood from her arms
a woman walks in sees her
house of breakfast nigi t as rachel moves through the restaurant three patrons stare stare stare at the blood stains on her coat
she slides into a booth with jesse
hes eating eggs
you dont look like a mass murderer now
she smiles sips a coffee
a country song comes on the jukebox
wow this music
guess we should just count ourselves lucky it aint hanson
a weak smile lisa hlud them
she was a friend of yours
sometimes id see someone from behind and id know id just know it was lisa
and then shed turn ound and it wasnt
but sometimes you know it was
whenever i see someone who looks like her and she turns around
it wont be
they both go quiet not knowing what to say
looks at his latch wow

n no if it wasnt for you i wouldnt have had this nutritious medl youre very polite for a jock

he drops some money on the table
i dont have any s cool i got it

i can walk yeah right
or i could wait for my limo you could
you could just wait fo that limo
he pulls up in front of rachels house and kills thank you
i guess ill see you in school tomorrow
youll let me know how walters doing
he extends his hand
she takes it
the shock of static electricity
their words are simultaneous
they both laugh
then go quiet
then just stare at each other
then the moment is gone
rachel gets out of the car through the gate back inside her house
jesse watches her go
starts his engine and his car rachel crossing the lot
her heartbeat can be heard
she looks up sees lisa approaching the roofs edge
rachels heart sounds like its bursting from her chest
somebody stop her
slow motion lisa falls through the air towards the car arms outstretched hair trailing like black flames
smash she goes through the windshield but the face is
rachels eyes pop open as her body jerks awake heart pounding
she looks around realizes where she is
under which is heard for a moment i thought someone was actually seeing me
but it was all a lie
sheriff kelton is reading from a photocopy of lisas sue and rachel sit in chairs
eric lied when he said i was special
and i guess i was lying to myself when i believed him
he folds the note
rachel is there anything in there that strikes a chord for you
do you know what lisa was referring to
after a moment yesterday morning she told me shed uh lost her virginity
kelton looks at sue produces the photo of lisa with eric
you recognize this boy
hes on the team
kelton gestures to sue and they step out into
with another heat carlin
banner in the background
what do you think
robbie i had a freshman crying in the hall last week
i couldnt get anything out of her but her friend told me a football player slept with her then dumped her
nothing illegal about breaking a girls heart
thats statutory rape
thats a stretch
then lets make it
i dont know whats going on around here but if thats what it takes to stop it lets stop it before someone elses daughter kills herself
ill look into it
sue sits behind her desk with rachel before her
how are you feeling
can i go no sue opens a file on her desk
i was looking at chic last night
it says here your moms in arkham
hows your mom doing
shes gonna be fine
i spent some time up there
as a patient
rachel looks surprised
does that surprise you
i mean you seem pretty normal
you visit your moat often
is that scary for you
well children of schizophrenics sometimes live with the fear of it happening to them
at your age its perfectly normal to be afraid of turning out like your parents
get real i know im ten times more likely to get it than most people
youve been in a series of foster homes since you were what four
hows your foster family
theyre happy z rig as they get their check every month
what about your real father
never met the gentleman
my mom wont even tell me his name
rachel stares at a ceramic mug of coffee very close o the edge of the desk
rachel in a way youve lost your mother
and now youve lost a friend
losing someone can be a very lonely painful place to be
youre right i
lost my mom i lost my friend the people who cared about me
but you only get paid to care
i really do care
how can i show you that i do
rachel is silent staring at the mug
but rachels shut off pushing down a storm of emotions
you know this room is a place where if you have feelings you can talk about them
you can let them out
sue sees rachels forearm near the coffee mug
and as if by proximity alone it edges off the end of the desk and falls rachel catches it in one smooth motion just before it hits
i mustve knocked it
sue the color draining from her face
see you knock it
the door swings open and the principal walks in lays a computer printout on her desk
sue could you update the absentee lists see who we have to call
she turns and rachel is gone
eric is at his locker wearing his bulldog letter jacket
he closes his locker to find rachel approaching him intimidated but determined
she looks him in the eyes
i know what you did
a chill goes through him
not saying a word he turns walks through the crowd looks back

chuck strips off his helmet jogs to the bench and opens a styrofoam cooler within it are slabs of raw steak on blood soaked ice

the barking rises as the players psyche up chuck who chews off a bite of the raw meat
jesse whispers to mark

mark takes a bow as he jogs away chewing
he spots the sheriffs cruiser pulling p to the practice field
rachel hugs her dog who looks a mess hind legs bandaged a funny cone around his head

she hears her doorbell go off
as rachel opens the door

as she crosses back to her room
theres a knocking on the kitchen back door
she frowns goes to the back door looks through the glass
no one there either
now shes worried
calls through the door boyd
she turns when the door handle on the front door jiggles once
she stops dead
the back door handle starts jiggling
she backs into the living room and spins as something starts tapping on one of the living room windows
like a wave moving around her a window on the other side starts tapping
rachel turns a full circle scared surrounded by tapping and jiggling which grow increasingly loud r
she puts her palms against her temples as if struggling to keep something bottled inside oh god oh god
stop suddenly all goes silent
she jumps as
the phone rings near her
she scoops up the cordless
theres a long pause on the other end

the window smashes down on the intruders hand
theres a muffled yell outside and the hand is extracted
headlights light up marks face as boyd and emilyns beat up station wagon approaches the house
mark whistles loudly
and takes off joined by eric clutching his injured hand
a se night rachel still stunned by what just happened
the cordless in her hand speaks hello
hello maam you still there
rachel slowly moves to tier bedroom doorway
boyd comes in the front door
things are fine
she hangs up as a clueless boyd takes in her freaked out appearance
she retreats into her bedroom looks at the window
the phone rings in her hand

click and the line goes dead
she hangs up
the phone rings again
she doesnt answer
the phone rings on another extension

curled on her bed with walter calls out im not here
jesse at the payphone sipping a royal crown cola

he hangs up
checks his watch
super weid nelina y
a screaming devil fills the frame
the bed of a speeding pick up truck is jammed with kneeling teenage boys wearing childrens halloween masks
theyre screaming bloody murder as they fire raw eggs at
the bergen students gathered at the entrance
the pick up speeds off as students recover straightening up from their ducking positions
mark and his cohorts go running after the truck
at freak hall arnie rises wipes egg yolk from his hair

jesse lets her pass with a chivalrous after you sweep of his hand then falls in next to her
rachels arm is grabbed by
may i speak with you a second
rachel crossing and uncrossing her legs its the last place she wants to be
she idly plays with the forest snow dome
sue doesnt look so comfortable herself
shes holding a stack of index cards
what are those tonights top ten list
these are just an exercise that will let me know how to help you better
youre wasting your time
just answer true or false to these statements
reads the top card theres a man inside the television set who tells me what to do
i dont see the point sometimes my thoughts assume the form of a giant insect
this ddesnt make any sense
answer true or false and this wont take all day
again sometimes my false
she sets down the snow dome
if you want to play the piano well you have to practice
i can see sounds and hear colors
large furry animals crawl on my face every night while i sleep
sue looks up surprised
i have a dog
sue nods watches rachel closely as she takes her time with this one not reading off a card
sometimes i can move things with my thoughts
rachel stares at her a million thoughts racing
the only sound is the clock ticking on sues desk
rachel grabs her backpack and stands
honey sit down
i just want to hel and fuck you
youre not my mother
rachel turns to go
sue jumps up grabs her arm and
on the desk exp des splattering water and white flecks all over the desktop

sue stares at it her worse fears coming true
as racbzl flies out the door
walsh sees jesse get tackled then help up the teammate who tackled him

jesse looks at the styrofoam cooler on the bench
a few of the nearby players begin their barking chant
the barking trails off
the other boys are stunned

show me youre a dog ryan
no can do
your attitude sucks
hit the showers

jesse doffs his helmet jogs to the bench
he douses his head with water sits there looking angry
players goof around snap towels at each other
clanking steel and grunts from the boys at the weight machines
the mist in a shower through which are glimpses of a lean male figure with rippling stomach muscles
mark and brad enter the showers
yo lover boy whatsa matter

brad how many points he gonna get for straightening a dyke
twenty no thirty
they fingertip high five each other
jess you score the skank yet
jesse just glares at him walks away

jesse finishes dressing between the lockers
mark wearing a towel approaches him
jess whats the matter
whats with the stunt you pulled last night
papering mccabes house
i asked you if you what you did at rachels
we were just sendin her a message
jesse slams his locker closed

he made his own decisions hes gotta live with em
and stay away from rachel or deal with me

mark shoves him back
the rest of the players in the background go quiet
low intense dont call her a skank dont call her a slut

im tired of all of it
what are you talking about

and he walks away
he sees jesse left his letter jacket behind hanging on the locker
close on graffiti reading king of hell rachel is looking at it while she waits to be buzzed in
the capped letters read kill
where rachel sits with barbara holding her hand
there are occasional moans and shouts from other patients
mama what was it like
when you started to
when things went bad
what did it feel like what did you see
h honey why do you want to did you see things move by themselves
i have to know
thinks then well first i thought i saw the devil in your eyes
then i started to see peoples faces looking
deformed like theyd had plastic surgery or the bones were moving under their skin
for a while i thought i had this bi snake wrapped around my neck and i couldnttalk or it would try to go down my mouth
barbara looks at her in confusion for a long beat
there is something different about you
baby are you all right
everythings gonna be all right
a buzz and as rachel leaves she smiles at
sitting on the couch
barbara shifts slightly looks at a chrome chair across from her
a large snake is coiled around her neck
she closes her eyes
and the snake is gone
theres the high mechanical wssshh sound of film sliding through a gate on the a microfilm machine as images stream past its screen
black and white abstract poignant fleeting with newspaper text scratches and magnified pieces of dust
is illuminated from below by the view screen
and now she stops on a newspaper front page chamberlain recorder
with a photo of c rik w iite at age seventeen
the headline identifies her as the girl thought responsible for the arson at chamberlain high school which killed people
the text below the photo states that ga nh white is the father of carrie white
grabs her forearm
the library is closing
sue snell walks up the steps of a nondescript municipal building
sue snell at the files
she pulls up an aging photocopy white n black o
rachel ann langs bi certificate
she scans the certificate finds mother barbara elizabeth lang
under her breath sues red volvo sits before the entrance to the hospital
sue looks at her eyes in the rearview mirror takes a deep breathe to summon her courage
you can do this
she gets out of her car holding a box of chocolates
sue strides up to the reinforced door
the sudden buzz o the lock seems to cut through her
she hesitates then pushes in to
and approaches the nurses station
im here to see barbara lang
stay here ill get her
sue looks around
this place holds a lot of bad memories
doctor nelson sos an overworked underpaid psychiatrist approaches with a smiling male patient
hello doctor nelson
suzy snell one of my rare success stories
what brings you back
im visiting the mother of one of my students
i heard about the good work youre doing at the high school
the patient turns and softly starts thudding his forehead against the wall
the doctor casually pulls him away before he can harm himself
excuse me sue
towing the patient come see me after
id like to hear how youre doing
sue sits before barbara whos picking her way though the chocolates
the moans of patients seem to rattle s thank you for the chocolates
thoughtful of you
lang why didnt you ever tell rachel who her father was
why was it important for her not to know
why would she need to
lang i need to know who he was
sorry thats private
lang its important that i know his name
i really dont see how thats any of your business
i promise you ill keep the information in the strictest confidence
barbara just looks at her chewing
im just trying to help rachel
she seems very troubled and im worried about her
very worried i am
you dont have children do you miss
no i dont
barbara regains herself then with tremendous conviction
then you dont kzgx
you will never ever know how terrifying children can be
sue frustrated its like punching water with this wo rachel needs my help
she has a
a disease a genetic disorder i think her father passed on to her
i need to know so i can help her
who was her father mrs
es sue then goes quiet lost in her memories
i did tell rachel how i met him
he said it was love at first sight
i was his waitress
i insisted he try the cherry pie cause id baked it myself
he said with every bite of that pie he could see our future together
by the time he got to the crust he could see what i would look like all old and saggy
and he still loved me
her smile fades then he left me after rachel was born
i never told her because people around here arent too fond of carrie white for what she did
i didnt want her having to grow up with that
his name was ralph
so they are half sisters
a castle a windmill and yards of worn astroturf
one of those places you go for fun if youre young and the citys too far away
montage of rachel and jesse on their date playing laughing
jesse takes a swing muffs a shot tosses his club
a tricky par four hole featuring a dogleg and a slope to the cup
rachel hits the ball
and it rolls a hole in one
she leaps in the air with joy
behind her jesse feigns dropping dead
a sign reads monarch motors below it are a row of used cars for sale hoods open like circus animals begging for peanuts
thats my dads dealership
y all that will be mine
rachel has her hand on the big hurst stickshift between the two bucket seats
he accelerates and rachel expertly shifts the gear
you are good
my foster dad taught me on his semi truck
where we going
the twinkling lights of bergen below
rach and jesse lay on the hood of his car leaning against the windshield
before he sold cars my dad wanted to write this book one hundred senators pick their favorite restaurants
so he wrote to all of them
all of them
dear senator so and so i am writing a book
he got two letters back
one was a form letter which said thank you for your support
and the other
the other was from hubert humphrey
he was the vice president once
he wrote back a three page letter raving about a place called wallys burger hut
my dad was knocked out
so your dad wrote a book color me impressed
he never wrote it
or he was going to and then my sister was born and then i was born
and there was this car dealership and it was security
so your dad wanted to be a writer
howd his kid end up being this sweaty armpit jock
sometimes when they throw me the ball it feels like time just slows down
and i know where to be and how to get there
when i have that feeling i catch it
and you like that
yeah i love it
hes got my life all mapped out
he wants me to take over the business
whats wrong with that
sounds like a nice life
selling used cars is not what i want
and unless i nail that football scholarship thats what ill get
i cant believe im telling you all this
ive never said any of this out loud to anyone before
takes a long look at her must be great not having to be like anyone else
its not so great
sometimes i wish i could just be one of the shiny happy people
does that surprise you
everything about you surprises me
theres the soft pops of rain hitting the car as it begins to drizzle then it comes down hard
rachel and jesse are in front facing each other leaning against the doors as rain streams against the windows
i used to know this guy could suck a strand of spaghetti through his mouth and out his nose
he called it brain flossing
he had a talent
you got football
itll get you outta this place
you can make your own path after that
write your own book
want to come with me
he leans forward
and she pulls away afraid then decides to let him
then she pulls away
she indicates the gear shift
is poking me right in the ribs
je es eyes flicker to the back seat
um i dont know how to say this
but ive never
and id want it to be special
like you ring the doorbell with flowers in your hand
whats your favorite flower
in his car
the streets wet but its stopped raining
rachel gives him a quick kiss goodnight
she pulls away exits closes the door for the rase sleeps fitfully tangled in her sheets
a massive gothic bed sits incongruously in a clearing
are making love
shes on top her hands on his chest
their glistening bodies catch the light of a ring of flames bursting around the bed
suddenly sink into the flesh of jesses chest
she screams as she tries to extract them
but strips of his flesh stick to her like flypaper
rachel twists violently as her torso melds into his
their bodies fuse a grotesque apparition with four legs and two heads
her mouth presses into his as their faces merge
the ring of fire leaps inward consuming the bed
rachel sits lost in thought
she stands up
so youre coming to the game right
i dont really get football
i need you for good luck
ill be there
i have practice today but i can pick you up later seven thirty
sure go practice
go be great
live the life you want
what kind of life do you want
i dont know
i have a hard time picturing it
well if you cant ill do it for you
what do you mean
i will predict your future
can i get a hint
m in it
on the patio are tracy mark and monica watching the
if hes gonna do it you know be seen talking in public with someone else he should show some respect
a slow boil he should show me the respect at least to be seen with someone pretty
someone who counts
amy or you you know ate
instead its its
and i feel
i wish there was something i could do to make him come to his senses
on marks face a slow insidious grin that seems to spread into eternity appears
lets nail the bitch
plan a way to screw her like shes screwing us
tracy a wicked smile as she nods
rachel watches sue at the door speaking to her teacher
sue points to rachel who looks less than thrilled
a dark smudge is spread on the empty parking space where lisa died
no one parks there anymore
sue is escorting rachel to her volvo
where are you taking me
theres something you have to see
a dream like glide past sues volvo parked on the roadside and through the trees
this used to be the school for the whole district
it was closed down in
a burned out hulk shrouded in mist
there was a fire here that year
the night of the prom
seventy three people died
a few of us survived
dark full of exposed wires metal rods and pipes countless empty beer cans
two mattresses are laid out amid the debris
sue stands on a pile of rubble next to rachel
theres a haunted look on sues face
strobing images of carrie white drenched in pigs blood
sounds of horrible screaming
a fire rages behind carrie as she steps off a platform turns and looks at us with the face of an avenging angel
present day as sue flinches
i havent really been here in over twenty years
but it feels like ive been back here every day since
can we go
this place is spooky
gives me the creeps
do you know what happened here
you just said
what caused it
they think a boiler blew up okay
am i gonna be graded on this
come on youve heard of carrie white
kicks a can everybody has
supposedly she set the fire as part
of a revenge suicide thing
elvis was her date and they escaped in a u
i know what happened to that snow dome on my desk
we both saw it
rachel looks at her isnt going to talk about this
i know everything there is to know about carrie white
she did this
it began with what you did with the snow dome
then it got out of control
its a genetic recessive trait
the male is the carrier when he combines with the right female the trait surfaces in their offspring usually in women
like kings disease hemophilia
what are you saying i have
its a trait rachel you inherited
with all respect lady youre seriously bat shit
im walking back to the real world
sues voice is low quiet
your mother told me your father was ralph white
it stops rachel in her tracks
i dont believe you
she never told me why would she tell you
you need help like what
like they helped you
so then its arkham for me
i can help you get it under control
you want to know what im feeling today
happier than ive ever been
so i dont want or need your help
rachel runs off
sue follows trips on the rubble falls
jesse stands at his locker dressing
no response from jesse just wanted to say two things
maybe i overreacted
dont play with me
weve been friends since we could both pee standing up
and i thought wed be best friends forever
never thought some girl could come between that
look i know im scum
im lower than scum im smegma im butt lint
smiles in spite of himself keep going
im not the one you should be apologizing to
ill come up with a way to make it up to b of you
smiles full charm tryin brother im tryin
light streams in through the slatted blinds
the young d
is at his desk
stark erics attorney father sits across from him with eric
sheriff kelton and coach walsh also sit in chairs
youre not really thinking of pressing charges against my son
were doing more than just thinking
i need the boy for the game
robbie weve known each other a long time since you were a bulldog

sue snell told me there were other girls those kinds of girls know what theyre getting in to
erics a good kid he may be guilty of some youthful youthful transgressions

the door opens and the towns mayor walks in grey haired distinguished with an air of authority
sit everybody sit m just listening in
he leans against the desk arms folded
cards on the table
my boy isnt going down alone then
he hasnt done anything other boys on the team havent done
eric can even get proof of it
mark bing jesse ryan chuck potter brad winters

robbie i just dont think i have enough evidence to ruin this boys reputation
thats it robbie
lou thank you for coming in

they all stand and shakes hands
kelton sits seething as he realizes the fix was in before ever entered this room
he he looks across at eric sitting a smug look on his face
mark intercepts jesse as he nears his car
hey man i got it

mark extracts a key ring from his jacket pulls a key off
my folks arent there

jesse looks at him
mark tosses the key jesse catches it
and bring her to my party
ill show you we can be one big happy family
tracy driving with monica as they follow a walking rachel
rachel crosses the street
finally shes going into the mall
an evil smile perfect
we have the homefield advantage
the cosmetics department of an upscale store mirrors on every counter
a saleswoman sprays perfume samples on passing shoppers
she pulls up short as she encounters
rachel wandering by out of place in her street urchin wear
the perfume woman watches rachel pass
stopping at a counter rachel takes in the vast array of makeup the models on the displays
she sees a young couple go by very j
crew very much in love
she turns to her own visage reflected in several mirrors on the counter
under her breath youre normal
at the end of the counter the perfume woman approaches a saleswoman helping monica
karen watch the girl in black make sure she doesnt pocket anything
monica turns around to see
rachel staring at a row of lipsticks
shes startled can i help you
uh just looking
the woman gives her a smile of devastating insincerity crosses her arms and just stands there
rachel gets her drift
monica walks up behind ra oh hi
karen this is a friend of mine from school
the saleswoman nods moves away
thought she was gonna frisk me
she does step class with my mom
you should see the scars from her liposuction
rachel edges way checking out the lipsticks but monica trails her
what are you looking for
is it perhaps something to wear on a date
perhaps with a certain jock hunk we all know
smiles nervous nailed no
you know tracy isnt universally loved
theres a shock
i think shes a melrose place superbitch
rachel cracks a hint of a smile
you have great lips
look this shade would look very kissable on you
monica goes to apply the lipstick on her
rachel pulls away
see tracy tried to steal brad from me
now hold still
and rachel does
so he invite you to the game
well theres a big party after
i hope you can go
i know it would mean a lot to jesse if we all got along
checking in a mirror rachel sees shes right
here these two would also rock on you
the saleswoman reappears
can i ring those up
how much are these
twenty two fifty
rachel sets the lipsticks down
monica smiles at the maybe next time
she pulls rachel away
as they walk the saleswoman keeps looking at rachel with distaste
a conspiratorial smile here i kleptoed it for you
she slips rachel the lipstick
rachel before the mirror applying the lipstick
harvey song plays under slow insistent seductive shes burst dropped off

she pulls on a silver thrift shop slip dress moves a slee ve to cover her tattoo
harvey contd so fruit flower myself inside out im happy and bleeding for you fruit flower myself inside out im tired and bleeding for you
she slips off her nose stud
jesse waiting in his car
he looks up rachel stands under the porch light in her dress
a lanky gangster girl with
one leg planted on a step like a cocked gun
shes bone chillingly beautiful
he gets out opens the car door for her
what happened to that little thing you wear that uh
he gestures to hibnose indicating her stud
took it off
i like it
rachel looks at the car seat
on it are daisies
just you know throwem in the back
a small cabin in the woods
fire light in the window
jesses car is parked in t
e gravel alongside
jesse is stoking a fire in the fireplace
theres a moose head trophy on the wall
rachels sitting on a bed draped with a chenille spread
it was nice of mark to lend us the place
hes really tryin to make peace
s to his party
but we wont go if y u d be uncomfortable
he moves to the bed
looks at her whats wrong
i feel like

she looks up at the moose heads marble eyes reflecting firelight
jesse drapes his jacket over the moose head
sorry bullwinkle lights out
sits on the bed feel better
he leans in to her
she backs away like a skittish doe
im sorry i just feel
i dont know
oh wow i am really losing my mind here
rachel its okay
it doesnt have to be tonight
whenever youre ready
and hey you know what youre the sanest person i know
and thats exactly what she needed to hear
she cups the back of his neck and pulls his lips to hers
they kiss a deep healing kiss
brushes aside one of the straps to her dress which slips off her shoulder
jesse tenderly runs his hand over her heart thorn tattoo
in the bed making love
firelight playing over their skin
what we all wanted our first time to be
they move slowly as if all the pain in the world could be erased i f only they could become one
jesse watches rachel her face open vulnerable
seems peaceful holding on to jesse like a child theyre covered by the chenille spread
their sweat clings to them like the softest of prisons
hes awake studying her
he gently runs his fingertips across her brow
i love you
off them and across the floor
to find a mi on the floor hidden behind a chair
follow the microphone cord to a closed window where it snakes out
theres the gaping lens of a video camera visible in the corner of the window
its red recording light on
dive into the black lens and
and the round black pupil of walters eye
he lays on the bed watchingrachel sneaking in through her window
trying to be mouse quiet
she gets safely inside when her bedroom door opens
boyd stands in the doorway
you were out all night
rachel nods defiantly
he walks over to her and without warning slaps her
no school today
you dont move from this room
he turns on his heel walks out
the dog looks as stricken as she does
of rachel in her bedroom as the day passes
the sun moves across the floor as a ghostly rachel and her dog fade in and out around the room
she lays in bed staring at the ceiling
paces her room like a prisoner
finally its nightfall
rachel slips out her window
and it looks even spookier at night
dimly lit as sue snell sits with rachel needs help
she doesnt believe me and im afraid for her
i want you to tell her who her father was
shell believe it from your lips
lang i really need your help before its too late
i can take you to her
will you help me
barbara slowly nods yes
the entire town has showed for this traditional rivalry and theres bulldog paraphernalia galore
rachel appears in the stands looking a bit lost
down front sit monica and amy
on the field are tracy and her fellow cheerleaders
monica nudges amy and waves to rachel rach over here
grab a seat
looking around rachel sees shes surrounded by patio people
oh please youre
not gonna sit by your lonesome
theres plenty of room if amy here slides her bubble butt
very witty ms
but she moves over
rachel tentatively sits
jesse enters mounds of hair are at his feet
he looks up
mark and most of the bulldogs have shaved their heads and are working on the last players
they turn to him in unison
chuck grins runs his hand over his scalp
we did it for the big game
cmon jess youre up
jesse stares in horror at how identical they all look now
then he starts to
giggle then breaks into laughter turns and walks away
man hell ruin the whole effect
monica and rachel
no no its an extra point when you score the kick after the touchdown
a safety is when you get tackled with the ball in your own end zone
thought that was a bunt
im kidding im kidding
heres what brad told me to say doesnt matter if something good or bad happens just say you
gotta be fuckin kiddin mel no matter what just say that
itll sound like you know whats going on
jesse and the team move through a dark tunnel and onto
with all the pageantry and sheer rush of a hometown crowd
the school band plays like theyre going to bust a gut
hysteria and bloodlust fill the air as the crowd starts a barking chant
on the sideline bench
he scans the crowd behind him sees
a notre dame scout wearing a fighting irish jacket toting a clipboard
jesse then spots rachel in the stands gives her a reassuring grin
she glances at the scout smiles back at jesse
tracy sees them is none too happy
slow motion a whistle sounds as a football is kicked to start the game
the ball spins end over end until
its caught by a bulldog receiver who starts his return then is popped hard and fumbles
an opposing player leaps onto the ball on the muddy quagmire of a field
n the stands
in accidental unison you gotta be fuckin kiddie me
they turn to each other burst into laughter
montage of the punishing game
epic warfare with grunting spitting and cursing as lineman butt heads and
a carlin running back steamrolls through the bulldogs for a touchdown
rachel monica and amy do their you gotta be fuckin kiddin me routine
jesse catches a pass and is immediately slammed hard rachel looks like shes been kicked in the gut
do they have to hit him that hard
amy rachels worried about jesse
dont worry i always looks worse than it really tracy and the other cheerleaders leading a cheer as
jesse glances at the sideline where the notre dame football scout watches him writing notes on his clipboard
the half time scoreboard and the bulldogs trail on the sideline mark smashes his helmet to the ground
mpatient sue sits before an exhausted doctor nelson
i understand you need to take out mrs
lang to do a drug abuse intervention with her daughter
but while shes doing well her condition may be fragile
in good conscience i could only release her in your custody for two hours
sue jumps to her feet to leave
you have a bunch of release forms to sign
ill go get them
on sue sitting knowing she may be running out of time
the bulldogs prove their worth with brutal play as they cream the carlin quarterback for a big loss
the fourth quarter scoreboard the bulldogs trail
the notre dame football scout writing notes as he watches
jesse cutting across the middle of the field
he catches a pass but two defensive backs converge on him and he gets bone jarringly plastered
jesse hits the ground with such force his helmet flies off
for a moment it looks like hes been decapitated
the hometown crowd rises to their feet as
jesse stays down hurt
rachel strains to see him as the team circles around jesse
four photographers rush along the sideline to snap shots their cameras flashing
jesse sits up stands shakes his head to clear it as he jogs to the sideline
the scoreboard clock loudly ticking from to
he looks up to
the night sky a football silently arches up spinning an achingly beautiful spiral in slow motion
the scoreboard clock a booming tick from to
jesse makes a spectacular one handed catch on the run streaking along the sideline
ahead of him a monstrous carlin linebacker closes in on him with murder in his eyes
all the photographers on the sideline have their cam g flashes flare in unison without their snapping them
the blinded linebacker plows into the sideline photographer jesse scores a touchdown
and the crowd goes berserk as the bulldogs throw their helmets in the air
you gotta be
rachel stands there open mouthed relieved but unsure if she had anything to do with what just happened
the bulldogs are still whooping it up as coach walsh approaches jesse
ryan notre dame scouts here wants to talk to you first
jesse nods turns to brad
brad can you tell rachel ill be out soon
have her wait for me
rachel and monica stand in the hoard waiting for the players
tracy passes soggy muddy yet still radiating a cool confidence in her beauty
she gives rachel a sharks smile
brad exits the locker room goes to rachels side
its gonna be a while jess is talkin to the scout he said for you to go ahead to the party
rachel did you hear that jesses talking to the scout isnt that great
cmon ill give you a ride to marks
sue drives up with barbara to rachels tiny run down house
no this couldnt be it
rachel said it was a real nice house surrounded by trees with a pool in the back
i guess she didnt want to worry you
the bedroom door is opened by emilyn
sue and barbara stand behind her
they find walter alone on the bed blinking awake
an upper class home built in the international style of fieldstone and gray stained wood
the house is set back from the road surrounded by trees with a pool in the back
a herd of parked cars and throbbing music indicate marks party is at full tilt
close on a inch tv playing psychedelic music videos and japanese anima
widen to reveal a dancingcrowd in a dimly lit split level living room with exposed wooden beams
theres a large roaring fireplace and a jackson pollock splatter painting hangs opposite
sliding glass doors overlook the backyard patio and swimming pool
chuck cuts through sees someone jostle a table lamp
dont break anything or markll have my head on a plate
monica leads rachel up the walkway to the front door where a beefy boy plays doorman
arnie and two geeky younger boys mill outside the door trying their damndest to look cool
hey monica can ya get us into the party
sure arnie wait here
ill come back for ya
and she waltzes past him
in two or three years
arnie points at a passing rachel
how come she gets to go in
rais s a toast to new friends
they raise their glasses and rachel joins in with a hesitant smile
their glasses clink together for the
jesse crosses the near empty lot hair wet from his shower
he stops dead
under a pool of lamplight his car has had its tires slashed and someone has sprayed in red carlin uies
a across the door
tracy pulls up in
her bmw wearing her cheerleading outfit
oh wow that sucks
further proof carlin guys are gravy sucking pigs

as he gets into her car tracy has one hand on the wheel the other hanging out her window
she drops something as jesse closes the door
reveal a can of red spray paint tracy dropped onto the parking lots tarmac
just a quick stop at my house want to change my outfit
her car pulls off
rachel and monica chat with amy and two other patio girls
amy takes rachel s hand

well yeah actually some
oh its just too cool
im dying to get one but my mom would have a shit fit

she says im not that type of gi rl

theres an awkward pause which monica breaks
throws an arm around rachel thats why you should take all of us in for tattoos
amy and the other girls laugh
rachel softens joining in
she looks around at everyone at the party laughing dancing
the shiny happy people
it feels weird but here she is
she smiles takes a sip of her drink
by the stereo mark cranks up the music as chuck dances over to amy pulls her into the dancing crowd
brad grabs monica
cmon wench lets dance
he pulls monica into the crowd and she gestures for rachel to join them
no id rather wait for jesse
oh cmon rachel
hed want you to have fun
yeah cmon rach
theres a chorus of cmon rachel from the guys and some of the other dancers join in
an embarrassed rachel surrenders sets down her drink and enters the dancing group
all right girl
brad starts dancing before rachel
slow motion close on rachels face dancing beaming
for a few moments everything seems perfect
and she throws her head back and laughs
mark dances into the group
hey chuckzilla why dont you put on the highlights tape
you mean tonights game
mark shares a laugh and a glance with monica and b yeah tonights game
lets go to the videotape he dances out of the group over to the vcr where he pops out a tape and inserts a tape marked bulldogs highlights
rachel turns around sees the large screen tv playing images of the bulldogs playing football
is that tonights game
no its the other game
still dancing she turns back to the group
what other game
the game you were in
the others laugh
she smiles confused
the one you played
yeah yeah what was the score
chuckie pass me the scoreboard i wanna show rachel how she helped jesse win the game
chuck pulls the black notebook next to the cds off a shelf pretends hes a quarterback hiking a ball
twenty four twenty six hut hut hut
he drops back to pass the notebook
go long bradzilla
mark laughs as brad circles around rachel twists between other dancers
chuck tosses the notebook over rachel and brad leaps up to catch it
post pattern mark
ducking around dancers mark raises his hands for the pass
kids start to notice their antics and start laughing
brad passes the book over to mark who catches it mimes spiking it for a touchdown and does a silly victory dance
monica laughs and turns to rachel who laughs even though she still looks a bit befuddled
he throws the notebook through the air where it tumbles end over end for a few slow beats then is caught by her
the tv set keeps playing football highlights but suddenly theres an almost subliminal flash of two intertwined bodies
rachel holds the notebook unsure of what to do with it
the boys are a little out of breath but still grinning and dancing
go head read off the scores
start with eric
yeah start with poor eric
she opens the book looks at the pages with a quizzical expression
she sees the bulldog names across the top of the page with lists of girls beneath each one
every girl has a number next to her with a total at the bottom
whats erics score
rachel stops dancing as she spots lisa parkers name at the bottom of erics column with the number four next to it
whats up rach
you know someone on that list
under her breath lisa
oh yeah lisa forgot about her
how many points was she
but maybe he shoulda lost those when she offed herself
rach look under jessess name how many points you get
two four six eight who do we appreciate
rachel looks down jessess column sees her name with thirty points next to it then above hers sees tracy with ten
no more than that remember we thought rach was a dyke
he got extra points for the conversion
rachel stares at the book stunned trying to make sense of it
look at her face this is priceless
at the front door jesse walks in tracy behind him
he looks around hasnt seen whats going on yet
eric intercepts him turning jesse away from the tv
hey man what did the scout say
the tv set between shots of players grunting tackling and smashing into each other longer and longer segments appear of
from the waist up with thick scan lines that almost make it look surreal
its obvious that the girl is rachel and the boy is jesse
dancing kids notice whats on the tv and start to point and laugh at the set
rachel is completely unaware of whats going on behind her
see we didnt think jess could do i so he offered to get evidence proof that hed scored you
here comes jesses big play
lookie lookie rachel
rachel realizes people are watching something behind her then laughing at her
she turns and sees
the images of her and jesse on the tv
her face goes slack with horror
oh god mark leans in to rachel who hasnt noticed jesse
jess was disappointed with the picture quality but i told him it was better than pam and tommy lees tape
rach was it good for you too
sure looks like it dont it
why dont we ask jesse
he turns and calls out
jesse looks over and his eyes meet rachels but she just stares back horrified
then he sees the tv set behind her what
jesse pushes his way through the crowd trying to get to rachel
tracy throws an arm around him kisses his neck
he told me he was thinking of me when he fucked you
seeing mark laughing jesse realizes whats going on
he tries to shrug off tracy but eric and chuck grab his arms and pull him back into the crowd
mark pushes rachel towards brad
she tries to get away but brad pushes her into monica who shoves her to amy as they join in the chanting
drowning out jesses cries
a nightmarish gallery of dancing jostling torsos twisted faces and laughing mouths smirking and pointing at her
of rachel and jesse making love
the assault of music chanting and images crescendo with
brad grabbing rachels bare arm below her heart thorn tattoo forcing her to face the tv screen
hey is that a zit on your ass
rachel has tears streaming down her face for the first time since she was four years old
she bows her head
glances down at rachels arm
the thorn vine around the heart tattoo looks bigger edging up her arm
he looks away shares a laugh with mark looks back and
on rachels upper arm is growing etched from within the thorn covered vine snaking like a tendril up her arm
he releases her
rachel raises her head eyes glowing with pain and rage her broken heart turned to stone
the delicate thorn vine has grown across her chin cheekbone and forehead swirling around to end on her other cheek
a stunned brad backs away from her
jesse breaks free of erics grip slugs chuck and pushes his way towards rachel
her heart pounds at an alarming rate as she slowly turns and sees jesse coming at her his arms out to take her in his embrace
on the bar dances and rattles then
a whip pan finds
jesse as his back arches in pain and he screams
the knife embedded in his open palm nailing his hand to the wall
mark and the other boys stare in shock
what the fuck
on jesse as he screams again
a corkscrew has pierced his other hand at waist level
the screw spins around burrowing into his flesh
everyone on that side of the room stops dead taking in the bizarre sight
rachel straightens up and
the kitchen door closes
the glass doors to the back yard slide shut
the front door slams
whats going on mark
the floor starts to shake like a small earthquake
all the partygoers go still looking around at each other
the room is frozen even though the music keeps pounding
mark looks at rachel her disheveled hair partially obscures her features but her eyes are glowing
surrounding the room begin to rattle then crack in a spider web pattern
the windows burst inward
follow the deadly hail of shards as they cut through the from above the outer edge of the crowd are mowed down as if by a machine gun and
a whip pan finds a boy impaled by a large jagged shard
are splayed across a wall of kids falling to the ground
the hard edged music keeps playing while
chucks decapitated head rolls across the floor and onto
the beefy boy spins around clutcning at a shard protruding from his neck his carotid artery spewing blood like a lawn sprinkler
on a girl as his blood sprays across her face and
the boy turns arcing blood across
the jackson pollock painting which blends into the multi colored canvas
reeling into the stereo the boy scatters cds everywhere
on rachel clothes spattered red tears streaming down her cheeks
tracy straightens up having been protected by monica who s screaming her face a lacerated pulp with glass shards sticking out of it like a pincushion
surviving partygoers panic as they struggle to their feet and try to flee stampeding over each other
tracy eric and brad shove their way through the crowd
as sue and bar
ba k leap from the volvo
sue hears the screams from within the house takes in the shattered windows
oh not rachel
they race to the door as
brad runs to the front door
an iron fireplace poker lifts up one end then flies like a javelin towards brads back as
barbara and sue approach the door when the end of the bursts from the center of it nearly spearing a surprised barbara in the face as it sticks out about
she jerks back then pushes the door open with an effort
they enter and freeze as the door slams shut behind them revealing a dead brad speared through the throat pinned to the door
oai my god
they see jesse then rachel covered in tattoos
a panicked itmy smashes into barbara then runs toward a window
rachel sees amy and her eyes narrow
music cds fly off a shelf and
spin through the air at high velocity
one of the deadly frisbees buries itself in amys back spinning her around
more cds embed in her stomach chest and throat
mark and eric smash their way through the chaos as marks eyes flash from a collapsing amy to rachel god itls her
shes doing it
sue moves towards rachel
rachel has her gaze locked on
mark who realizes hes a dead man
he moves toward a shattered window through which some people escape
but rachel turns her head slightly and
a telekinetic pulse travels across the row of liquor bottles at the bar exploding them one by one spraying alcohol which douses sue
a flaming log erupts from the fireplace
striking the alcohol drenched bar setting a blazing trail and lighting the curtains on fire creating a wall of flames before the windows
you dont want to and rachel snaps her head around launching another log from the fireplace which strikes sue in the back whose alcohol drenched clothes catch flames
and she a
a screaming sue pitches forward rolls on the floor to put out the flames but caly succeeds in lighting another trail of liquor which creates a barrier to the backyard
in the eye of the storm is barbara shaking her head in denial muttering as her mental state rapidly deteriorates
no this isnt happening
it isnt happening isnt happening
mark pulls eric by the shirt collar and they careen down
where each of the doors ahead of them slam shut as they approach
utter chaos but rachel calmly turns into the hallway following mark as if in a trance
lowers his shoulder crashes through a closing door into
where the walls are decorated with deer heads and hunting trophies
mark and eric are smashing a standing glass case containing pistols and rifles
tracy leans panting against the wall
mark slips a handgun into his belt
screw that get the shotguns
shaking freaked out they gather weapons
d eric see rachel the end of the hall silhouetted from behind
they take off in the other direction tracy bringing up the re barrelling shoulders first into a door the boys burst through and into
exta the back yard night where they almost stumble into the swimming pool
toting their rifles mark eric and tracy turn to find rachel at a gunfighters distance coming towards them
tracy and brad cock their weapons and bring them to their shoulders
tracy slips on her glasses
wait till shes closer
tracy tightens her finger on the trigger
rachels eyes narrow and
tracys glasses shatter into her eyes spewing blood milky fluid
she staggers fires her shotgun into erics groin and he lands sitting next to the pool
a dying eric stares at his shredded lap then falls over
mark looks at his dead friend
recovers and swings his aim back at rachel
but his rifle goes sailing over his head and into the grass twenty feet behind him
he makes eye contact with a grim rachel advancing toward him and hauls ass
rachel glances at a coiled garden hose and it springs to life slithering through the grass and across the concrete at high speed to wrap around marks ankle and trip
he hits the ground hard and rolls over to find the hose twisting around his legs and up his waist like a python
grasps for the rifle but falls short as the hose pins his other arm to his side then curls around his windpipe in a stranglehold
his eyes widen as the life is squeezed from him and he sees rachel standing over him
he gropes for the shotgun again
and finally grabs it
rachel looks at the rifle and it flies from his hold splashing into the pool
but she jolts on two
rachel looks down
mark had pulled the handgun from his belt with his pinned hand and fired
shes holding her belly gutshot staggers and falls into the pool disappearing amid a swirl of blood
mark yanks the hose from his neck as it goes slack
he gasps points the gun into the pool and fires until its silent and hes left pulling the trigger on empty chambers
he gets his breatking under control leans over to look into the water of the deep end
he aar on the sound of a mechanical whirring and turns
a pool cover starts to unfold
at that moment
bursts from the water and grips his neck
mark grabs her forearm as her other arm yanks him into the pool
as rachel drags mark down he kicks and pummels her but she holds on
the pool cover steadily closes over them shutting out the light from above
mark finally frees himself and lunges for the surface but the pool cover blocks his escape
he desperately pushes at it eyes bulging lungs burning as his feet kick to keep him afloat
the pool coyer closing as rachei hauls herself from the water barely making it out
marks hand grabs her leg slides then clutches at the edge of the pool
his fingers slip under as the cover completely shuts
m rxs head bulges the pool cover then his hands punch feebly at it a few times
a weakened rachel lays by the pool
she seems to be snapping out of her trance as she rolls over and sees barbara
rachel shudders and suddenly just looks like a wet scared little girl reaching for her mother
o but its a four year old rachel pristine without tattoos
barbara blinks and her p
is of a ten year old rachel reaching for her
barbara blinks and its now
the year old rachel covered in blood and tattoos
she looks her daughter in the eyes backs away in terror
what are you
youre not my little girl
the devils in you
dont leave me mama
but her mother disappears into the shadows
please i dont have
she rolls onto her back looks up at the starry night
please god let me die
and she tightly shuts her eyes
a vision of hell crimson stained walls and piled bodies
the fire is spreading licking its way across the burning scoreboard notebook and along the floor toward
jesse in pain still pinned to the wall
he raises his head and starts in fear as
o the center of the room facing him
he sees the gunshot wounds in her stomach then follows her gaze to
with a cracked screen but still playing the tape of their intimate moment at the cabin with a sleeping rachel laying he looks back at her
i swear d know they were taping us
d never hurt you
she looks at his pleading eyes
the tv set now has the video footage of
jesse looks at rachel clinging to him asleep peaceful
he gently runs his fingers across her brow
i love you
and oulls her closer
rachel staring at the tv
and the vcr rewinds and replays
on tv the moment of jesse saying i love you to her while she was asleep
rachel falls to her knees tears running down her face
she turns back to jesse amazed
a blazing chunk of ceiling falls near her
gat out now
and the knife and the corkscrew drop away releasing him
he falls to the floor drags himself over
and takes rachel in his arms
he cradles her
she whispers and he bends over to hear
she whispers again
jesse tenderly kisses her lips
and all the tattoos fade from her face and body love
her face is serene
jesse traces his fingers across her brow embraces her the flames start to encircle them just like in rachels nightmare
jesse pulls rachel over the debris ridden floor toward the back windows but stumbles and goes down
her eyes flutter open
get out instead of leaving her jesse hugs rachel closer
the sleeve of his jacket catches flames
and he accepts his fate
rachel shuts her eyes gives one last telekinetic push
and a body is flung out the back window like a rag doll clothes in flames
the body goes fifteen feet and falls onto the pool cover its weight bowing the cover enough for water to rush over it
inta the living room night rachel on her back looking up eyes open a slight smile on her lips
the burning ceiling collapse raining death on her
is now a burning inferno
a funeral pyre
at water level
all is quiet theres only the sounds of the crackling fire and faraway sirens of firetrucks
suddenly jesse hurts up on the from miles away the light given off by the burning house rises over the treeline
a dejected arnie and the two uncool boys who couldnt get into the party leaning against a van staring in amazement
man we are missing one killer party
and the peaceful sound of crickets for the
a church tower with a bell overlooks the student dorm buildings
the darkened campus is tranquil still
moving down a
the room doors feature rock posters and fighting irish stickers and pennants
jesse is slumped over asleep on a desk layered in textbooks and a notebook
an all night study session
his hair is shor
hes wearing a beard
his face is more mature sadder
the beard largely hides some burn scars on one side of his face
over the desk is a mirror and a fighting irish pennant
the only light comes from his desk lamp
he jerks awake with a spasm glances at a digital clock glowing on his desk s a
rubs his eyes jesus
walter rachels dog hops on his lap licks at
the sad eyed dog whimpersand jesse scratches him
in the distance the clock tower bell can be heard chiming midnight one two
as jesse looks down and his eyes widen in surprise somehow hes scrawled on the notebook paper on the desk in front of him king of hell or if you
only look at the capitalized letters it reads around it the same phrase is written over and over again king of hell king of hell king of hell king of hell king of hell king of hell king of hell king of hell jesse lowers the dog how did
trails off as he stares at the page
the clock bell in the background is still chiming give six seven and
t h e f r e n c h doors fly o behind jesse
its the wind
the dog starts barkin shushes the dog ssshhhh
he takes a deep breath flips the page on the notebook resumes his cram session
on the floor the dog looks at the open french doors then scurries under the bed
jesse is writing in the mirror above h a woman s figure anding in the french doors her face hidden up sees the woman reflected spins to watch her stop
forward into the light
its rachel in hak slip dress
she lifts her arms to him
with growing joy rachel
he rises envelops her in his arms and kisses her
he pulls back to take her in
s two of thaw are reflected in another mirror behind the r s door
opens her mouth to speak flies out and jams itself into jesses mouth throwing him back
clutching at the snake as it slithers down his throat and qmis i into the desk and mirror shattering it on the int
dorm room notre dame nigh a a loud scream as jesse jerks awake at his desk
his heart fatim like its about to explode from his mouth
he looks down at the paper in front of him
filled only with his study notes
the dog walter is awake on the bed blinking having been stirred by the scream
he recovers runs his hands through his hair
the digital clock reads a
in the distance the clock bell beginschiming midnight one three
jesse reads but in his ayes hes waiting for the savant chime
the bell chimes four the french doorsninat jesse spins
he turns back to his reading his heart beating wildly again
glances up at the mirror
his heartbeats and the bell chimes get increasingly lq as
he reads glances up at the mirror shivers and it isnt in the cold
move to another angle where his image is multiplied to infinity in the two mirror
fear is written on his face
and we know hell be looking over his shoulder
until the day he dies
