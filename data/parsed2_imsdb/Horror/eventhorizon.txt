screenplay by philip eisner a vast field of stars
the gas giant neptune slowly spins into view
brilliant and blue and cold against the void
stands out against the planet tiny against neptunes scale
to discern the hard angles of a man made craft
no longer dwarfed by the planet the scale of the vessel emerges a vast labyrinth of steel
its shadow swallows all in darkness
shafts of neptunes blue light enter through windows illuminate debris suspended in the zero gravity environment shards of metal and glass
move from the corridor into a cockpit for three
neptunes blue light fills the chamber reflects off immobile particles in the air
thick quartz windows look down at neptune
the cockpit lights are dark but for one blinking red light
an emergency beacon
under floor lights go on
the strobe of the red light reveals a man floating at the helm slowly spinning
he is dead perfectly preserved in the cold vacuum of space
his eyes are empty black pits and his mouth hangs open in a scream dr
weir opens his eyes waking from dream
sweat beads his ascetic etched face
many years a scientist
he turns on the bedside lamp revealing a couples apartment
decorated by a woman but weir is alone unless you count photographs
his nightstand looks like a shrine to a beautiful woman
weir reaches to the stand
the woman appears thin and haggard and wears a small brave smile
weir lies back on the bed
looks at the photo
presses it to his forehead and closes his eyes
trying to be with her just one more time
whisper i miss you
weir stands in front of the bathroom mirror shaving with a straight razor
the mirror reveals the bathtub just behind him
drip drip drip
weir turns to stare at the bathtub
water wells up at the mouth of the tubs faucet grows impossibly large falls
weir turns back to his shaving
weir stands in the kitchenette staring at the microwave as it cooks his breakfast
weir stands before his window chewing his oatmeal mechanically forcing himself to swallow
he reaches out to open the blinds
as the blinds pull aside revealing weir upside down
weirs window is just one of many in a space station a delicate combination of cylindrical habitats and solar panels
the structure hangs above the earth in low orbit
a videophone rings os
this is weir
weir admiral hollis would like to see you as soon as possible
a military office united states aerospace command seal blazoned on the door
views of the earth
admiral hollis sits behind his desk a gruff career officer and a good man
weir enters escorted by hollis adjutant lyle
you wanted to see me admiral
i apologize for the short notice bill but weve had something come up that requires your immediate attention
lyle activates a holographic display of the solar system
a box magnifies the eighth planet neptune revealing a flashing red dot in its orbit
at oh three hundred this morning tdrss picked up an automated navigation beacon broadcasting at two minute intervals in neptune orbit
lyle hands weir a stack of hardcopy data
weir reads the data with growing excitement
these are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared
this this happened
this isnt some kind of hoax
i wouldnt bring you here on a hoax
houston confirms the telemetry and i
excited its the event horizon
shes come back
hollis answers drily
that ship was lost in deep space seven years ago
if the titanic sailed into new york harbor id find it more plausible
beat houston wants aerospace to send out a search and rescue team investigate the source of the transmission
if it really is the event horizon theyll attempt a salvage
beat we need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ships systems for the salvage crew
a written briefing cant possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this
i have to go with them
lyle looks at weir stunned by the request
weir you have no experience with salvage procedures
i designed the ships propulsion system
i am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive
you cant send a search and rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed
that would be like
like sending an auto mechanic to work on the shuttle
i can understand your desire to redeem your reputation dr
weir but it doesnt factor into this
this is not about my reputation
this is not about me at all
beat passionate the event horizon was created for one reason to go faster than light
imagine mankind exploring new solar systems colonizing new worlds
seven years ago we didnt just lose the ship and the crew
we lost the dream
beat quiet and relentless i have to go
its not that simple
off of weirs expression lyle play the recording for dr
navigation control tried to hail the vessel
this was the only response
lyle presses a button on hollis desk
an unholy garble rips from office speakers static and noise and inhuman voices
alone each sound would raise the hair on your neck
together they are unbearable
the sound mercifully cuts off to static
lyle stops the tape
weir sits there stunned
since the initial transmission theres been no further contact
just the beacon every two minutes
could they still be alive
the ship had life support systems for eighteen months
theyre been gone seven years
someone sent that message
admiral you have to put me on that ship
hollis stares at weir judging the man with his eyes
its against my better judgement but ill run this by the man downstairs
youll know my decision by the end of the day
dont thank me bill
im not doing you any favors
the door closes behind him
youre not seriously considering sending him
you dont just dismiss bill weir
the man held oppenheimers chair at princeton
if the event horizon had worked he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since einstein
the official inquiry blamed weirs design for the ships loss
that doesnt mean a damn thing
they were looking for a scapegoat and weir fit the bill
but hes not responsible for what happened to the ship
does he know that
whats on your mind
he doesnt belong on this mission
responsible or not he blames himself
hes too close to it
beat and then theres his wife
its been two years since she died
hes over it
some things you dont get over
i want our best people on this
the lewis and clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt shes docked in bay four
the lewis and clark pulls away from daylight station turns towards the depths of space
it is a tough looking spacecraft all engine
sequence omitted from original script
move in on thick quartz windows near the ships nose the bridge
above avionics navigation flight control
starck female navigator sharp mind sharp tongue checks the navigation data on her screen as smith male pilot wrapped too tight punches in the course
i cant believe this i havent gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit
why not mars cap mars has women
theres nothing out there
if something happens well be on our own
the captains chair drops from above swivels to reveal miller male captain intense
i dont like it either but you know the rules we get the call we go
is the course locked in
locked and cocked
were past the outer marker we can engage the ion drive whenever youre ready
below the bridges war room ships systems and mission stations
justin male engineer young hot shot
everything green on my boards skipper
start the countdown
ion drive will engage in
t minus ten minutes
miller slides down a ladder into the war room
the others follow into
bulky eva extra vehicular activity suits line the walls
music blares from a jambox built into a storage locker
an emergency tech stows safety lines cooper male the resident pain in the ass
he sings along with the music
not breaking stride kill it
cooper reaches up turns off the box
time to play spam in the can
dont start with me cooper
cooper falls in as the crew continues into
evidence of long term habitation
fold down bunks chairs tables currently stowed for docking
a modular galley
peters female emergency technician the crews denmother and dj male doctor a cold perfectionist load co scrubbers into a bin in the floor
weir stands to the side like a fifth wheel
captain miller i just want to say
the clock is running dr
if youll follow the rest of the crew theyll show you to the gravity tanks
weir hesitates then follows the crew into medical
miller hangs back
whats the hold up
just loading the last of the co scrubbers
to miller accusatory good for four months
i put in for a replacement for you but no one
no no its alright
i talked to my ex hell keep denny over christmas and ill get him this summer
beat goddam it skipper
i havent seen him in two months
i am sorry
but now we have to go to work
a high tech operating room
vertical tanks line the walls each large enough to hold a human being gravity couches
the crew stands before the gravity couches almost nude no room for modesty
starck catches cooper looking at her ass as she strips to her undergarments
she flips him off not bothering to turn around
is that an offer
it is not
two service tags hang around his neck
he does not remove them
weir approaches him
captain miller i appreciate this opportunity
doctor weir my crew is not going on your mission because we want to
we were pulled off a well deserved leave to be sent out to the middle of nowhere and no ones even told us why
ive been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach neptune space
until then do what youre told and stay out of my way
weir nods moves to an empty couch bearing his name written on a piece of tape
peters watches him
first time in a grav couch
she checks weirs couch helps him climb in
weir keeps one eye on miller
off of weirs glance dont worry about it
hes hard but hes fair
youre lucky to be shipping out with him
hes one of the few captains in the service with experience in the outer reach
hes been past mars
he served on the goliath
wasnt that ship destroyed
nods they attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for titan
the shuttles oh two tanks ruptured during the rescue flooded both ships with pure oxygen
there was a spark and both ships were incinerated
the skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat
captain miller was able
interrupting he doesnt like to talk about it
dj swathes one of weirs arms with alcohol
you didnt eat anything in the past twelve hours
weir shakes his head
when the ion drive fires well be taking about gees
without a tank the force would liquefy your skeleton
dj injects weir
the scientist winces
ive seen the effect on mice
the overhead lights change to red
dj hands him the breathing mask
put this on
dj checks the fit
youll be fine
youll wake up and well be there
watch your fingers
dj closes the tank
it begins to fill with green gel
weirs eyes grow large with fear and then the anaesthesia hits
his eyes close
his body draws into a fetal position
checking the monitor heart rate decreasing
body temp dropping to
hes in stasis
the ion engine at the aft of the ship begins to glow a deep red
the crew hang inert in the gravity couches
the engine flares white hot
the lewis and clark lances forward
the lewis and clark races silently past
the engine at its aft holds a sustained fusion reaction like the sun
lewis and clark
immobile in the grav tank
he might be sleeping
he might be dead
a distant sound echoes though the ship the unholy garble of human and inhuman voices it is the event horizon calling to him the sound refines into a womans voice
no more than a whisper billy
weir opens his eyes
im so cold
weirs grav tank opens
the seven bodies of the crew suspended inert in the gel
a sound drip
weir slowly walks to the bridge
im so cold
a naked woman sits at the helm her back to us
her skin is very pale
water pools around her chair
weir stands behind her
she does not answer
she does not move
weir reaches out to touch her shoulder then pulls his hand back afraid
he reaches out again
he touches her hair
she doesnt move
weir catches her reflection in the computer monitors
something wrong with her face
he starts to spin her around
im so cold
weir awakes with a jolt in his grav couch
his mask has slipped
his tank has filled with blood
he is drowning
weirs eyes open
he presses against the glass of the tank trying to force it open panicked
the others are already stepping from open tanks
weirs tank opens with a hiss
he tumbles to the floor gasping fluid streaming from his mouth
peters rushes to him
to weir its okay
weir catches his breath
he looks up
the crew surrounds him concerned
im alright now
dj helps him to his feet
youve been in stasis for fifty six days
youre going to experience a little disorientation
weir dont scare us like that
no thank you
cooper still butt naked and proud of it grabs a metal cylinder from the wall and pours a mug for himself
you wanna dry my back
starck gives him a cool once over
maybe when you finish puberty
miller zips up
starck why arent you on the bridge
i just finished drying
then what are you doing here
come on people lets go
to cooper and cooper
put some pants on
the lewis and clark drifts towards neptune
the crew has secured the quarters from flight status
bunks have been folded down each alcove personalized with photographs and pin ups
dj moves around the cabin checking the crews radiation badges
cooper and justin sit on their bunks tossing a handball across the cabin
peters holds a watchman video unit watching a video letter
from denny her four year old son a paraplegic grinning widely in his new wheelchair video play horsey mommy play horsey
in the video peters enters shot scoops her child from the chair
video want to play horsey do you
weir sits huddled in a blanket
miller takes a seat next to him
starck and smith enter
starck sits next to miller
hours to neptune orbit
all boards are green everythings five by five
thats good to know
justin you wanna stow that
justin catches the ball holds onto it
okay listen up
as you all know by now we have an addition to our crew
weir this is starck navigation smith pilot justin ships engineer you can call him baby bear he loves that
this is cooper what the hell do you do on this ship anyway
to weir i am your best friend
i am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker
hes a rescue technician
peters medical technician
and this is mission specialist dr
we all know where were going
weir is going to tell us why
miller and the crew look at weir waiting
weir clears his throat
what i am about to tell you is considered code black by the nsa
the crew look at each other they havent heard that in a mission briefing before
that means top secret cooper
i heard it
the usac intercepted a radio transmission from a decaying orbit around neptune
the source has been identified as the event horizon
then everyone talks at once thats impossible
she was lost with all hands what seven
seven years ago the reactor blew
how can we salvage
let the dead rest man
cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission
everybody shut up
let the man speak
in the quiet that follows what was made public about the event horizon that she was a deep space research vessel that its reactor went critical that the ship blew
none of that is true
beat the event horizon was the culmination of a secret government project to create a spacecraft capable of faster than light flight
the crew stares at weir he has just dropped another bomb on them
you cant do that
the law of relativity prohibits faster than light travel
we cant break the law of relativity but we can go around it
the ship doesnt really move faster than the speed of light it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously jump from one point in the universe to
another light years away
well in laymans terms you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons these in turn fold space time consistent with weyl tensor dynamics until the
space time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity
weir thinks of another way to explain it
he rips a pin up from smiths locker
say this paper represents space time and you want to get from point a here
marks it on the photo with a pen to point b here
marks point b now whats the shortest distance between two points
the crew stares at him
starck decides to play
a straight line
the shortest distance between two points
weir folds the paper lining up point a over point b
then thrusting his pen through both skewering the pin up
thats what the singularity does it folds space so that point a and point b coexist in the same space and time
after the ship passes through this gateway space returns to normal
hands the ruined pin up back to smith its called a gravity drive
how do you know all this
i built it
even cooper is impressed
i can see why they sent you along
so if the ship didnt blow up what happened
it was the ships maiden voyage to test the drive
the event horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters
they received the go ahead to activate the gravity drive
beat and the ship vanished from all our scopes
no radar contact no enhanced optical no radio contact of any kind
they disappeared without a trace
beat until now
where has it been for the last seven years
thats what were here to find out
the lewis and clark flashes silently past heading deeper and deeper into space
the crew assembled
we havent been able to confirm any live contact but tdrss did receive a single transmission from the event horizon
weir punches a button on a console
the transmission blares from the bridges speakers static and noise and underneath all inhuman voices
the crew listen look at one another
the recording ends abruptly
what the hell is that
it doesnt sound like anything human
houston has passed the recording through several filters and isolated what appears to be a human voice
he activates a different file
the resulting wail is more human but no less terrifying a cry of despair
the last message from a drowning man
what is that
it sounds like latin
who the fuck speaks latin
its a dead language
what does it say
nsa encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message
weir plays the hellish incantation for a third time
they havent been able to translate the rest its too distorted
to weir youre convinced the crew could still be alive
after seven years
the event horizon only had life support for eighteen months
it seems impossible but in light of the transmission
i have to think that someone has managed to endure until now
skipper do we get hazard pay for this
you heard the tape smith
were looking for survivors
the lewis and clark closes in on the blue planet
the flight crew assembled
data flashes across the main monitors on the bridge
crossing the horizon
optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees
come around to three three four
echoing heading three three four
continuing make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees
one four degrees
rcs thrusters pivot and fire as the ship enters neptune orbit dropping lower and lower into the dense blue clouds
the ship begins to rock as it encounters atmosphere a growing vibration
graphics flash across the main windows hud
neptunes dark shadow fills the screen
we have a lock on the event horizons navigation beacon
its in the upper ionosphere were in for some chop
bring us in tight
starck get on the horn see if anyones listening
into radio this is u
aerospace command vessel lewis and clark hailing event horizon event horizon do you read
this is the lewis and clark hailing
she continues b
over starck matching speed
range to target ten thousand meters and closing
skipper i got a bad feeling about this
were all on edge smith
were a long way out
thats not it
that ship was built to go faster than light
thats just wrong it goes against everything we know
what are you trying to say
if god had intended man to fly he would have given us wings
something like that yeah
miller grins grimly
i guess were about to find out
keep us slow and steady
weir sticks his head into the bridge
i think you want to see this
weir climbs up the ladder to the flight deck
where is she
dead ahead meters
suddenly the ship shudders violently
weir braces himself in the doorway staring out the forward window into the roiling azure clouds
smith grimaces his knuckles white at the controls
weve got some weather
starck anybody home
if they are theyre screening their calls
range meters and closing
i cant see anything
only turbid clouds of methane ice whirl past the lewis and clarks windows
were getting too close
where is it
checking her console the scope is lit its right in front of us
a red warning light begins to flash in time with a shrill proximity warning
were right on top of it were gonna hit
it should be right there
she looks up trails off
the clouds break revealing
the event horizon right in front of them
a black labyrinthine blasphemy against neptunes arctic blue
cloud banks encircle the ship as if it were the eye of a hurricane
reverse thrusters full
the event horizon looms enormous as the lewis and clark hangs off the port stern dwarfed by the giant ship
the turbulence subsides
the bridge crew stares at the massive craft
the only sound the proximity warning
finally jesus that is one big ugly fat fucker
shes not ugly
miller reaches over smiths shoulder turns off the proximity warning
smith snaps back to business
range meters and holding
turbulence is dropping off
picking up magnetic interference
put it through tacs
smith you up for a flyby
he is not love to
the lewis and clark maneuvers in close to the event horizon dwarfed by the dark ship
smith keeps a tight hand on the controls
the crew stare out the viewport at the abandoned craft
look at the size of that thing
weir explains the view out the cockpit window
crew quarters bridge medical and science labs hydroponics what have you
that central section connects the forward decks to the engineering containment area
can we move in closer
shit doc any closer and were gonna need a rubber
his hands move carefully over the controls
the lewis and clark moves even closer
vanishing into the shadow of the event horizon
the crew stares at the ship rushing past the viewport
a huge spherical structure looms eerily ahead
thats the engineering containment
and theres the main airlock
we can dock there
smith use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster
its not a load bearing structure
the lewis and clark carefully maneuvers in close to the event horizons airlock
a mechanical boom arm extends from the smaller ship to latch onto the event horizon
its clawed hand grabs the antennae cluster
the cluster buckles under the stress
to weir it is now
to miller were locked in
starck give me a read
a scan of the event horizon appears across starcks screen
the reactors still hot
weve got several small radiation sources leaks probably
do they have pressure
the hulls intact
but theres no gravity and the thermal units are off line
im showing deep cold
the crew couldnt survive unless they were in stasis
find em starck
starck frowns at her display
somethings wrong with the bio scan
theres not enough radiation to throw off the scan
im picking up trace life forms but i cant get a lock on the location
could it be the crew
if they were in suspended animation wouldnt that effect the scan
if they were in stasis id get a location but these readings theyre all over the ship
it doesnt make any sense
we do it the hard way
deck by deck room by room
starck deploy the umbilicus
i believe youre up for a walk mr
go get your bonnet on
weir starts to follow justin from the bridge
weir i need you on the bridge
captain i didnt come out here to sit on your bridge i need to be on that ship
once the ship is secured well bring you on board interrupting that is not acceptable overlapping once weve secured the ship thats the way it is
beat i need you to guide us from the comm station
this is where i need you
help us to do our job
the docking collar umbilicus extends to the event horizons airlock
miller peters justin and cooper in eva cooper and justin without headgear
come on skipper i already put my shoes on
muffled youve had plenty eva coop its justins turn
stay on station
if anything happens
ill be all over it
miller nods to peters
muffled opening inner airlock door
the inner airlock door opens ch thunk
miller peters and justin enter the airlock
justin attaches his safety line
miller and peters do not
you still need the rope
i thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins
id rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it
now step aside old man
cooper puts justins helmet on
it seals tight
serious now you just keep your nose clean baby bear
clear the door
cooper backs out allowing the inner airlock door to shut echoing through the ship
miller peters and justin float down the brightly lit umbilicus into the event horizon all in eva suits
justins safety line trails out behind him
the outer airlock door of the event horizon waits for them
weir has taken over justins station
he watches the pov monitors like a kid watching christmas
smith and starck keep tabs over his shoulder
youve reached the outer airlock door
peters attaches a thumper a device using sound waves to measure pressure to the inner airlock door
weve got pressure
clear and open on my mark
peters inserts a zero g drill into the panel beside the door
the door slowly opens
the immense corridor stretches away into darkness in both directions
distantly spaced windows manifest as remote pools of blue light amidst endless black adding to the vast sense of scale
the light from their dual spotlights on the teams helmets reflects off tiny ice crystals of frozen atmosphere
they are ants in a tomb built for giants
jesus its huge
ice crystals everywhere
this place is a deep freeze
radio youre in the central corridor
it connects the personnel areas to engineering
peters and i will search the forward decks
justin take engineering
no hot dogging not on this one alright
not a chance sir
the group separates
justin kicks off from the wall shoots down the corridor at immense speed
miller and peters move in the opposite direction
they use magnetic plates on their boots and gloves to cling to the walls as they slowly make their way down the dark shaft
their journey seems endless
the darkness almost seems a living thing as it surrounds them
miller spots something at a coupling where two sections of the corridor join
weir whats this
miller indicates a box nestled against the coupling
the universal symbol for explosives is on the cover
ahead at the next coupling heres another one
theyre all over the place
radio theyre explosive charges
i can see that whatre they for
in an emergency the charges detonate in series destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship
that way if the gravity drive malfunctions the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat
peters and miller keep moving
that means they didnt abandon ship
so where are they
starck any luck with the bio scan
im running diagnostics now skipper
nothings wrong with the sensor pack im still getting trace life readings all over the ship
miller and peters unconsciously look around
sweat beads their faces
theres no one in the corridor but us
radio not according to the computer
peters is right no ones here
i dont know this place is really dark i cant see a thing
she starts to wave her searchlight around wildly
calming her down easy peters were okay were okay
lets finish the sweep
radio captain miller the foredecks are just ahead
i can see the hatch
starck you still showing those readings
radio thats an affirmative
to peters keep your eyes open
she nods as he reaches for the hatch
the hatch opens allowing peters and miller entrance into the forward decks
these areas were intended for human habitation and seem similar in design to the lewis and clark only larger
gravity couches line both walls eighteen in all
we found the gravity couches
weir peers eagerly at the monitors
hope drains from weirs face
theyre empty dr
miller and peters split up each taking a separate exit from the chamber
weir looks at justins pov screen a grainy image of the first containment seal
justin stands before a thick pressure door
justin checks the door with his thumper his boots are now on
radio youve reached the first containment seal
the engineering decks are on the other side
we still have pressure
the radiation counts steady at millirads an hour
radio background radiation
justin touches a panel beside the door
a long corridor shaped like a tube
it rotates like a turbine causing vertigo
justins breath echoes in his helmet as he moves forward
cooper stares at justins safety line in the airlock
counts off silently passing meters
the corridor ends at a pressure door
weir whats this the door to
radio youre at the bridge ms
you still havent seen any crew
miller moving through a deserted lab
empty operating tables
stainless steel surgical instruments float in zero g
a glove floats up behind him brushes his shoulder
the glove is empty
it spins away
if we saw any crew doctor youd know about it
looking around im in medical
no casualties it looks like this place has never been used
he finds a computer console
peters opens the door
looks around a small antechamber for crew briefings with chairs and a display table
red crystals float in a crimson mist around her
i found something
weir peers at the monitors trying to make out the red haze
yes we can see some kind of mist
what is that
looks like arterial spray
nervous can you see a body
confused theres no one here
radio the blood came from somewhere peters
theres no one here skipper
peters takes a sample container from her belt
carefully tries to capture a suspended crystal
and the container peters brow furrowed with concentration
blood and tissue
someone died here in a violent and terrible way
peters starts to look up but the flash dies away
she never saw the horror behind her
peters turns her attention back to her tiny crystal
she traps the it returns the container to her belt
she moves from the antechamber into
her helmet lights sweep the room
every surface a control panel
im on the bridge
radio what you got peters
peters examines the other consoles most are dark but for a few dim lights
everythings been shut down
conserving power i guess
green light on the hull its intact
the science workstation has power ill see if i can find the crew from here
weir stares at peters monitor
peters turn back and to your left please
on her monitor peters pov shifts as she complies
what is it
radio i see it
peters reaches towards a small video deck
touches the eject button
justins light bounces off an even larger pressure door built like a bank vault
the second seal
ive reached another containment door
this things huge
radio thats the second containment seal
beyond that engineering
im going in
justin opens the seal
it releases slowly inching open
justin squeezes through
peters takes a small probe from her belt inserts it into the video deck
a small laser disc emerges partway from the deck
peters pulls on it
it doesnt move
its really jammed in there
a shadow crosses the window behind her
someone something is in there with her
peters pulls harder
the disc pulls free
peters spins in the zero gravity spinning into
a body floating at the helm the face illuminated by peters helmet lights
his swollen tongue clogs his gaping screaming mouth
his cracked and crystallized skin is crossed by a network of bloated veins
he has no eyes
just like weirs dream
peters monitor shows the corpses face its mouth open in mute agony
peters pushes free of the body
professional i found one
the dead mans face leers from peters monitor
what happened to his eyes
decompression wouldnt do that
weir just stares at the ruined face rapt
weir nods not taking his eyes from the screen
cooper on station
he keys his radio
hey baby bear mama bear got a corpsicle for ya
miller looks up from the workstation concerned
radio baby bear you copy
cooper stares out at justins safety line slowly counting off past meters
justin do you copy
the second seal is open
justins safety line snakes into darkness
follow the safety line into the dark
an alcove opening into a vast chamber
once pristine all the surfaces have been coated in a dark gray slick
globules of fluid hang motionless sticking to justins suit leeching away his light and swallowing him in darkness
radio do you copy
quiet uh yeah coop im still here
do not do that
where the fuck are you
im in the second containment area
its pitch black in here
there must have been a coolant leak
man this shit is everywhere
i cant see a damn thing
a lighted console blocks justins view of the chamber beyond
he drifts over to it wipes the console clear of coolant revealing dim lights the station has power
the reactors still hot
coolant level is on reserve but still in the green
triumph i got it
his expressions changes as he looks past the console and sees
trailing off in awe holy shit
i think i found something
a massive sphere meters in diameter dominates the center of the second containment
intricate machinery surrounds the sphere but the globe itself is featureless smooth a enigmatic monolith
black ice encrusts it giving it the seeming of a living thing
they stare at justins monitor
what the hell is that
thats the core the gravity drive
the heart of the ship
radio justin check the containment for radiation leaks
radio hows the client
justin examines the outer wall of the core looking for any cracks or ruptured seams
radio justin finish your sweep
almost done i just gotta check one thing
justin turns to the core
justins monitor fills with static
justin hold on a sec youre breaking up
static obscure her voice justin reaches towards the core with his pressure sensor
his helmet light flickers
millers helmet light flickers
peters helmet light winks out
justin come in
suddenly the bio scan lights up from green to red as signals race across the display
what is it
i dont know
the life readings just went off the scale
justin places the pressure sensor against the core
the core turns deepest black
a darkness that light cannot penetrate
for a second justins white suit is captured against the hungry void
cooper stares in shock as justins safety line as it reels out at an incredible rate meters meters
surges out of the core bending light like a ripple on a pond pushing coolant and debris before it
the gravity wave surges forward blowing out emergency lights as it comes flotsam and jetsam swirling in its wake
data floods millers workstation flashing across the screen too fast for comprehension
what the hell
a deep roar fills the ship
miller rises to investigate
the door blows apart as the wave hits ripples through the medical bay towards miller
debris swirls around him
the wave sweeps him up
slams him into a bulkhead
the briefest suggestion of a screaming face obscured by static and roll before the screen cuts to static entirely
the rest of the crews pov screens go dead as
the wave hits them threatening to tear the lewis and clark apart
the ship shudders violently
consoles explode with sparks
weir and the others hold on for dear life
miller do you read me peters get them back im trying goddammit an equipment rack ignites
smith grabs an extinguisher fights the blaze
cooper and dj bracing against the bulkhead
cooper hits the intercom
intercom i dont know the screens are dead
cooper peers out the airlock window
passes meters and accelerating
hes in trouble
cooper grabs his helmet
dj helps him lock the helmet into place with a hiss
the inner airlock door opens
as cooper enters the airlock justins safety reel stops the line jerking taut at meters
miller tries to get his bearings in the dark
boarding party sound off
peters do you read me
peters light too remains dark but neptunes blue light fills the bridge
the frozen corpse floats before her
no longer a man
a young boy maybe five years old
his legs are withered useless things
the skin remains a crystallized surface but the eyes look straight at her alive
peters reaches out to touch the body
it falls away from her
no longer her son but the body of the astronaut
it hits the door and shatters
growing desperation peters do you read me
a mans voice in agony crackles over millers radio radio dont leave me
justin sound off
miller trails off as red light flickers across his visor
a burning man stands in medical science a human body wreathed in flame
the eyes are like sunspots
as the burning man moves bones and black flesh poke through the fire
he raises one hand to point at miller in accusation
millers breath stops in his throat
his mouth works but nothing comes out
and the vision is gone
miller is alone breathing hard
cooper enters at full speed shooting through in a controlled fall
hold on baby bear
into the second containment
he catches himself at the console
cooper sees justins safety line cut off abruptly by the darkness of the core
oh my god
the darkness of the core ripples
justin suddenly emerges from the darkness a white figure riding a wave of impenetrable blackness
cooper catches him holds him tight as the wave carries them towards the wall
cooper sees a control rod a long metal spike coming at them
he twists his body so that they miss barely before slamming into the wall
justin do you read me
cooper pulls justin close
justins head lolls to one side
baby bear dont do this
dont do this
weir starck and smith continue to hold on tightly as the vibration builds
here comes another one
the second wave hits
sparks fly as consoles explode
deep in the ship metal screams followed by the shriek of escaping atmosphere
an emergency klaxon rings out pressure warning
starck checks justins station we lost the starboard baffle
the hulls been breached
the bridge pressure door begins to close
and then stop
the safety circuits failed
were losing atmosphere
there are pressure suits in the airlock
starck pushes weir ahead of her smith follows hard as they run the length of the ship for the airlock bay
the vibration subsides
can anybody hear me
radio you okay
im im okay
her voice cracks as she says it
she looks anything but
the reports come one on the other
radio we have a man down
coop where are you
radio the containment second containment
hold on coop
radio captain miller
smith where the hell have you been
we have a situation here
starck and smith already in suits
dj assists weir
smith has already locked his helmet into place
continuing we lost the starboard baffle and the hull cracked
our safety seals didnt close the circuits fried miller moves down the central corridor towards his wounded ship
do we have enough time for a weld
radio we dont have time to fart
were losing pressure at liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked
in three minutes our atmosphere will be gone
we are fucking dead
no ones dying on my watch smith
what about the reserve tanks
radio theyre gone
miller closes his eyes desperately trying to think of a solution
pan across the faces of the astronauts
except for weir the event horizon
the others turn to stare at weir
it still has air and reserve power we can activate gravity and life support
what if the air has gone bad
we cant wear these suits forever
i dont think this is a good idea we dont even know what happened on that ship
it beats dying mister smith
get on board the event horizon
ill meet you at the airlock
you heard me smith
peters are you with me
peters at the life support console
im ahead of you
bringing the thermal units on line
peters flips a series of circuit breakers
reaches for the final switch
hold tight and prep for gees
everything floating in the bridge crashes to the floor
justin and cooper collapse to the deck coolant splashing down all around them
miller meets the crew as they evacuate the lewis and clark
weir leads the way eager smith hangs back
were all here
lets find out how much time we just bought
miller reaches for the catch on his own helmet
we havent tested the air yet
it could be contaminated
we need whatevers left in our suits to repair the clark
like it or not this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers
miller pulls his helmet off with a hiss
he breathes deep
starck does the same coughs
it tastes bad
but you can breathe it
the lewis and clark and the event horizon locked together in neptune orbit
lights shine from the horizon as power is restored
no longer cloaked in darkness it is revealed in all its hideous glory a nightmare etched in steel
weir moves from station to station restoring power to each
starck sits at the communications workstation
miller watches over her shoulder
the antennae arrays completely fried weve got no radio no laser no highgain
no ones going to be coming to help us
how much oh two do we have
oxygen is not the problem
nods its building up with every breath we take
and the co filters on the event horizon are shot
we can take the filters from the clark
i thought of that with the filters from the clark weve got enough breathable air for twenty hours
after that wed better be on our way home
what about the life readings you picked up
the event horizon sensors show the same thing bio readings of indeterminate origin
right before that wave hit the clark there was some kind of surge right off the scale but now its back to its previous levels
whats causing the readings
i dont know but whatever it is its not the crew
so where is the rest of the crew
weve been over every inch of this ship and all weve found is blood
weir just stares at the bloodstained wall
what happened here
miller follows weirs gaze to the wall a rorschach test in blood
pull back from the bridge windows to reveal
the event horizon in all its horrific glory hanging skew in the center of the hurricane like a mote in gods eye
the lewis and clark clings to the giant craft as insignificant as a tick
an even smaller figure clings to the hull of the lewis and clark
its smith eva in full protective gear
his magnetic boots hold him to the lewis and clarks hull
he kneels over a hole in the hull where the metal has buckled and torn
vapor still leaks from the hole into space
captain miller you copy
radio im here smith hows the clark
ive found a six inch fracture in the outer hull
we should be able to repair it and re pressurize its gonna take some time
radio we dont have time smith
in twenty hours we run out of air
smith uses a foam applicator to fill the hole
the gel freezes in place
smith reaches to his belt pulls out a zero g nailgun
presses it to the patch and begins to rivet it into place
justin lies unmoving on a table
his eyes are open staring at a smear of blood on the ceiling
a needle slides into the skin below his eye
he doesnt respond
dj removes the needle
it glistens with blood
he looks up at miller and peters
how is he
his vitals are stable but hes unresponsive to stimuli
he might wake up in fifteen minutes
he might not wake up at all
what happened to him
dj shakes his head
miller eyes the bloodstain above them
dj take samples from these stains compare them to medical records i want to know whose blood this is
gravity has scattered debris and freeze dried blood about the room
the crew justin and smith excepted tries to relax on the chairs of dead men
their faces are wan and haggard
weir relaxes at the table
unlike the others he seems almost at ease
dj remains forever stoic starck animated and nervous
cooper bounces the handball on the floor a reflex action
miller stares at a video monitor watching smith repair the lewis and clark
he turns from the window
okay people theres been a change in the mission
in less than eighteen hours we will run out of breathable air
our primary objective is now survival
that means we focus on repairing the lewis and clark and salvaging whatever will buy us more time
pause our secondary objective is finding out what happened to this ship and its crew
two months from now i fully intend to be standing in front of the good admiral giving my report and id like to have more than my dick in my
grim smiles all around
peters i want you to go through the ships log see if we cant find some answers
i can use the station in medical keep an eye on justin
starck i want you to repeat the bio scan
whats the point
ill just get the same thing
i want to know whats causing those readings
if the crew is dead i want the bodies i want the crew found
i can reconfigure the scan for c amylase proteins
one of my men is down
i want to know what happened to him
i told you
he was inside the core
weir starts shaking his head
it was like
nothing was there
and then justin appeared and the core
cutting him off no he didnt
you werent there
i saw it
saw what mr
what did you really see because what youre describing is not physically possible
cooper throws the ball at him hard
it bounces wildly around the room
miller catches it
cooper sits down
turning on weir dr
weir justin may die
whatever happened to him could happen to all of us
i dont know what happened to justin
im telling you i saw it
what you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion
turning on weir i know what i saw and it wasnt a fucking optical effect
hold on whats this gravitational distortion
its possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the core distorting space time
they could be what hit the lewis and clark
what could cause them
weir doesnt answer whats in the core
how much time do you need
we have seventeen hours and forty two minutes
now what is in the core
here comes another bomb
a black hole
the crew stares at him stunned
miller starck and weir stand before the core
dark ominous structures loom around them glistening with coolant
the pulse of the ship is loud here a deep thrum that steals their breath
weirs voice is a reverent whisper thats how the gravity drive works you see it focuses the black holes immense gravitational power to create the gateway
thats how the event horizon travels faster than light
i cant believe we built this
the finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship
it would take the lewis and clark a thousand years to reach our closest star
the event horizon could be there in a day
if it worked
if it worked yes
they stare at the core the surrounding machinery moving in a slow giants dance
a trick of the eye or does the core stare back at them
i want this room sealed
the second containment is off limits
theres no danger
the black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields its under control
your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart
it may have killed one of my men
beat no one goes near that thing
until its darkness fills the screen
peters sits before the computer workstation running the ships log forwarding through hours of boring footage
rubs her eyes
the lights flicker
peters hears something rustling behind her
justin lies unmoving on the nearest examination table
peters reaches out and picks up a scalpel
peters hears the sound again fingernails on plastic
she moves past justin
past several empty tables covered with clear plastic
to the last table
she stares in shock
she slowly reaches out
lifts the cover
her son denny looks at her and giggles
the scalpel drops to the floor at her feet
denny reaches up to her to be picked up
but the plastic that still covers his withered legs squirms like a bag full of snakes
peters drops the plastic and backs away
dj stands in the doorway holding blood samples
peters turns back but her son is gone
dj reads her expression
the airlock light turns red a warning
the inner airlock door control flashes locked
the outer airlock door opens
he closes the outer airlock door
atmosphere hisses into the chamber
the inner airlock door flashes cooper in eva getting ready to go outside
the inner airlock door opens
takes off his helmet
you been out there a long time
trying to break my record
id rather spend the next twelve hours outside than another five minutes in this can
this ship is bad
it watches you
you heard me
this ship its crazy trying to go fastern light thats like the tower of babel
shit smith youre going biblical on me
you know what happened to the tower of babel dont you
it fell down
youre sucking too much nitrogen in your mix
starck programs the sensor workstation
she glances over at weir sitting at a computer terminal his face rapt as data flashes by
his lips move muttering to himself
weir i think youre in love
claire used to tell me i loved the event horizon more than i loved her
i told her that wasnt true i just knew the event horizon better thats all
claire is your wife
it must be hard being so far away from her
i miss her
two years now
weir keeps his attention focused on the screen
these things happen
reacting to something on the screen wait a minute thats not right
he fingers fly across the keyboard double checking the data
miller leans over weirs shoulder
you have something dr
what about it
the event horizons computer thinks its
the ships internal clock is off by seven years
maybe a power interruption crashed the system
no theres no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind
its as if time just
stopped for seven years
intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time its possible
beat black holes make sense on paper its all math you see but as to what really happened
he shakes his head the event horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality and like lazarus returned from the dead
the intercom interrupts them intercom captain miller dr
i found the final log entry
peters sits at the workstation
miller dj and weir stand behind her watching
a jumpy handheld camera view of gravity couch bay
two crewmen checking electronics modules
the ship is well lit clean no sign of debris
the narrators voice is excited and nervous
we have reached safe distance and are preparing to engage the gravity drive and open the gateway
the speaker is the mission commander
quiet john kilpack
a lone engineer finishes his check of the core
he turns to the camera and gives a self conscious thumbs up
when you get this message god willing we will reach the solar system of proxima centauri
i wonder if they ever made it
the entire original crew assembled playing catch with the stuffed dog i just want to say how proud i am of my crew
id like to name my station heads chris chambers janice rubin dick smith tom fender and stacie collins
and to bill weir and all the scientists that got us here
kilpack addresses the camera
his face is flushed with excitement
uh i had something historic to say and i wrote it down but i
i cant find it
ave atque vale
hail and farewell
a burst of static
followed by an inhuman howl of feedback like screaming hyaenas almost alive
through the swirl of static the suggestion of movement
miller freezes the frame
he squints at the screen
obscured by static the image is blurred beyond comprehension
what the hell is that
i dont know
i can run the image through a series of filters try to clean it up
suddenly the lights fade out
dim emergency lighting snaps on
a power drain we barely have enough power for life support as it is if we cant stop the drain were not gonna make it
weir heads for the door
but weir has vanished into the corridor
the rest of you stay here i dont want anyone else going near that thing
miller follows after weir
the second containment seal opens
weir is about to enter when miller stops him
he checks a geiger counter
it is silent
whats causing the drain
weir crosses to a console
shakes his head the magnetic fields are holding
maybe a short in the fail safe circuit
ill check it out
miller assists weir in removing bolts from an access panel
the panel falls away revealing a cramped duct leading into the ships circuitry
weir climbs into the duct
miller hands him a flashlight and a toolkit
we dont get the power back our airs gonna go bad
check the core for radiation
carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries
weir begins to crawl into the depths of the ship
weirs breath echoes in the cramped shaft
he counts off circuit panels as he goes e three
where are you
miller slogs through the coolant to the core
stares at it
it remains metallic mundane
he pulls out a geiger counter and crosses to the reactor shell
examines a gleaming weld
the geiger counter clicks slowly no leak
a yellow light starts flashing on the engineering board
starcks eyes widen the engineering sections flash yellow
what the hell
as the bio scan goes wild
into intercom skipper the bio scan just went off the scale
justin shakes on the bed in an epileptic fit
dj rushes to him
can you hear me
justins eyes remain unfocused unseeing as he tries to speak
dj leans in close trying to hear him speak
justin arches in agony and the words come in a strangled tortured voice weir stops before module e
hears a faint hissing and there you are
he uses a screwdriver to open up the module
reveals a series of circuit boards
weir plucks the damaged chips and starts running a by pass
his flashlight flickers
he bangs it against the duct wall
it grows dimmer
i uh i seem to have a problem with my light
a single drip of water in the darkness
beat hushed captain miller
another drip then a womans voice like a distant echo billy
weir starts at the sound
he recognizes the voice
she speaks again no longer far away but a close whisper in his ear billy
im so cold
weirs eyes open wide in hope and fear
even the emergency lights go out
we just lost all power in here
millers voice trails off as he looks towards the core
a red glow reflects across his eyes
he takes a few steps away from the reactor
at the burning man standing before the core
the deep roar of its conflagration fills the containment
it slowly turns and raises its arm and points at miller in accusation
dont leave me
miller stares as the burning man turns and vanishes into a bulkhead leaving the wall blackened and burned with his passing
weirs breath echoes in the cramped metal space
a whisper claire
weir bangs his flashlight
im so cold
the flashlight flickers
claires face is inches from weirs
his flashlight flickers again snaps on
she is gone
weir lets his head fall to the floor of the deck breathing in ragged sobs
the crew except for cooper
dj whets a scalpel against the leg of his jumpsuit an unconscious gesture
carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations impaired judgement
goddammit dj it was not a hallucination
i saw a man he was on fire
and then he disappeared
maybe one of the original crew
it was someone else
ignoring the question dr
weir you were right there you must have heard something seen something
i saw nothing
all heads turn to her
about an hour ago
i saw my son
he was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were
she trails off isnt it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge
ive seen bodies before
this is different
she falls silent unwilling to say more
peters is right
its like something reaching into your mind
seeing your thoughts and making them real
smith did you or cooper experience anything unusual
smith leaning against the doorway i didnt see anything and i dont have to see anything
this ship is fucked
thank you for that scientific analysis mister smith
you dont need to be a scientist figure it out
weirs face is stone
you break all the laws of physics you think there wont be a price
you already killed the first crew
dj lays one hand on smiths shoulder to calm him
smith reacts violently turning on dj shoving him back
dj uses smiths momentum to spin the pilot into the wall
he presses his scalpel just below smiths ear
the scalpel falls from his hands
he releases smith
im sorry i
i dont know why i did that
wry carbon dioxide
smith goes for weir
hes fucking lying you know something
miller heads him off grabs him
thats it thats enough for one day smith
i need you back on the clark i need you calm i need you using your head you make a mistake out there none of are getting home you understand
get outside go back to work
ill join you shortly
were a long way from home and were in a bad place
lets not make it worse
if anyone has any constructive suggestions now is the time
i think i can stabilize the fields around the singularity that should prevent another power drain
to conserve our oxygen we should severely restrict our activity
anyone who can should get some sleep
i dont need sleep dj
i need answers
not slowing what is it starck
i ran the bio scan with the dna rna filter
the results were bio readings of indeterminate origin
bio readings of indeterminate origin dont you have anything useful to tell me
ive got a theory
there was a another surge in the bio readings right before you
you saw what you saw
we picked up a similar readings right before the clarke was damaged
what if there were a connection between the two
the gravity waves the hallucination all part of an defensive reaction like an immune system
miller starts walking again
i dont need to hear this
she rushes to follow
miller and starck enter the airlock bay youve got to listen
what are you saying
this ship is alive
i didnt say that i said the bio readings correspond to what happened to you the ship is reacting to us
were hanging on by our fingernails and youre giving me bullshit stories
she grabs him by the arm
its not bullshit its the only conclusion the data supports
starck do you know how crazy that sounds
i know that
miller allows himself to relax
if you knew it was impossible then whyd you waste my time
i thought you wanted an answer
and thats the only one i have
miller pulls an eva suit from the wall starts putting it on
what i want is to survive the next ten hours
checks her watch nine hours and twenty two minutes
im going outside to work on the clark
dont tell anyone what you just told me
weve got enough to worry about
he locks his helmet into place
the ship seems to breathe
the lights flicker
the ship seems to breathe
the lights flicker
the ship seems to breathe
the lights flicker
peters has fallen asleep in her chair
on the threshold of hearing a distant pounding
not a heartbeat
metal on metal
something trying to get out
something trying to get in
peters wakes with a start
justin lies on the floor in a heap completely covered by his sheet
she crosses to him
pulls back the sheet
revealing empty nitrogen tanks
she looks up eyes widening as
the iv bottles fill with blood
blood fills the x ray lightboxes it surges up from gutters in the floor
and the pounding grows louder
almost to medical
the spell breaks and she runs
peters sprints the sound booming after her almost on her heels
peters darts into the bridge antechamber
she slams the pressure door shut behind her cutting off the sound
weir dj starck look up from their work staring at her
you didnt hear it
you must have heard it
peters starts to laugh part hysteria part relief
dj crosses to peters concerned
as he reaches out to touch her
dj clutches her to him backs away from the door
the pounding grows louder
the door vibrates with each blow starck puts her hands over her ears
peters screams at the door
but the pounding intensifies metal groaning under incredible pressure
shouting to be heard what is it
weir slowly walks to the door
what are you doing
it wants me
i have to go
he reaches for the door
starck grabs him
he tries to shake her off but she traps his arm in a wrist lock
he turns on her his face furious
and the pounding stops
they remain frozen for a moment
afraid to breathe
weir shakes the trance
in our current environment dr
weir self control is an asset
in the distance the pounding begins again
moving away from them
the ship systems station beeps
a warning light flashes on the console
what is it
the forward airlock
into radio miller smith cooper any of you in the airlock
radio thats a negative starck
peters starck and dj rush from the bridge leaving weir behind
peters leads starck and dj down the corridor towards the forward airlock bay
they round a corner in time to see a figure moving in the airlock
they race into the bay even as justin steps into the airlock
he is naked
justin turns and stares through them with cold eyes
he reaches out to the airlock control
the pressure door shuts with a hiss
miller smith and cooper cling to the lewis and clarks hull
they carefully remove an access panel revealing scorched wiring
well have to re route through the port conduit to the apu
what about the accumulator
starcks voice breaks in radio miller come in
whats going on in there starck
radio justins in the airlock
starck at the intercom
the others huddle by the door
hes awake hes in the airlock hes not wearing a suit
to cooper stay here
dont stop working
ill get him
miller swings his body around heads across the umbilicus to the event horizon
he moves in great leaps using the magnetic plates in his gloves and boots to keep from drifting off into neptunes thin atmosphere
starck works the airlock control panel without success
hes engaged the override
can you shut it down
she opens the airlock access panel
dj you better get your bag of tricks
dj nods runs off
peters bangs on the airlock door
open the door
peters voice barely penetrates the pressure door muffled open the door
justin turns off the artificial gravity
he begins to float gently
miller moves like a frantic spider across the surface of the event horizon
im on my way starck
radio you better hurry
hes engaged the override we cant open the inner door
miller curses under his breath moves even faster
peters against the window muffled the door justin
open the door
he fixes his gaze upon the outer airlock door
and beyond it space
he speaks in a flat monotone did you hear it
they are stunned to hear his voice
peters answers yes
yes justin we heard it
keep him talking
do you know what it was
muffled it gets inside you
it shows you things
cant describe it
there are no words
weir sits alone listening to the voices on the intercom
intercom what justin what shows you
intercom it wont stop it goes on and on and on
intercom what does
intercom the dark inside me
a low moan escapes weirs lips
he cradles his head in his hands
miller races across the surface of the event horizon the only sounds his laboured breathing and justins tortured voice patched through on his radio radio its inside and it eats
and eats until theres nothing left
radio the dark inside
i dont understand
radio from the other place
the other crew theyre there theyre waiting for me
theyre waiting for you
i wont go back there
peters presses her face against the airlock window trying to calm him justin look at me
look at me
open this door
dj runs up with his medkit
i dont think she can talk him down
we need a sedative
if he opens the outer door hell turn inside out
starcks hands fly as she re wires the circuits
sweat beads her face
almost got it
muffled come on baby bear open this door
justin looks at her with dead eyes
he reaches out to gently touch the glass between them
if you could see the things ive seen you wouldnt try to stop me
youd come with me
justins hand moves to the outer airlock door control
then floats to the outer airlock control
muffled a yellow warning light flashes
a warning klaxon whoops deafening
justin jerks his hands to his ears closes his eyes
stand by for decompression
justin opens his eyes as if waking from a dream
hey mama bear
what are doing
and then he realizes where he is
and what is about to happen
oh my god oh my god
the inner door cant open once the outer door has been triggered it would decompress the entire ship
muffled you gotta open you gotta stop it please
we have to do something oh god
into radio skipper justin just activated the door
its on a thirty second delay
miller moves through the event horizon superstructure recklessly leaping from one beam to another trying to build up speed
patch me through to him
skipper you gotta help me
tell them to open the door
radio they cant do that justin now listen carefully
miller moves faster and faster his breath echoing in his helmet
he can see the exterior airlock just beyond a deep chasm in the ships superstructure
if he misses this jump justin will not be the only man to die today
he doesnt hesitate but leaps soaring across the chasm towards the airlock
radio i dont want to die
youre not going to die
i want you to do exactly as i say and im gonna get you out of there alright
but i cant
i gotta get out of here
i wont let you die
millers words give justin hope
he regains some control
justin breathes hard and follows millers hurried instructions radio tuck yourself into a crouched position shut your eyes as tight as you can
miller lands on the superstructure opposite the exterior airlock
radio exhale everything you got baby bear we cant have any air in those lungs blow it all out
justin goes into a fetal crouch and covers his eyes
oh god he wheezes out all his air
miller squats on the girder ready to push off
he focuses on the meters of space between him and the airlock
the outer doors open
the rush of escaping atmosphere carries justins body out
miller pushes off
catches justins body
sending them both back towards the open airlock
ice forms on justins body
his veins bulge
blood fountains from his noise and mouth forming a red icicle over his face
miller pulls him into the airlock
five seconds have passed since the airlock door opened
miller closes the airlock behind them
air hisses into the chamber
justins body hits the deck as normal gravity exerts itself
miller opens the inner door
peters and dj rush in
dj puts a tube in the justins mouth immediately feeding him oxygen
ive got a pulse hes alive
over and falling
blood bubbles from justins mouth and eyes
he gasps then screams spraying blood from his mouth
he can breathe
lets get him to medical go go
starck helps dj and peters carry justin from the airlock
miller sits there exhausted
reaches up and pulls his helmet off
weir listens to intercom intubate pure oxygen feed get the nitrogen out of his blood
intercom his peritoneum has ruptured
intercom one thing at a time lets keep him breathing
start the drip ccs fibrinogen christ hes bleeding out
one of the tanks has been activated
swaddled in bandages justin floats within suspended in green gel
the others dj starck peters miller weir look exhausted
if we ever make it back
well make it
co levels will reach toxic levels in four hours
peters stands looking at justins ravaged form floating in the tank
we need to know what happened to the crew
before it happens to us
weakly ill get back to the log
but on the bridge i wont go back back in there
justin said something about the dark inside me
what did he mean
it means nothing
is that your expert opinion
the only answer weve had out of you is i dont know
justin just tried to kill himself
the man is clearly insane
how would you explain your own behavior
on the bridge
you said it wanted you
weir glances at justin
but its not justin in the tank
its his wife claire naked wet dead
weir stares at her
i said that
justin floats in the grav couch
weir turns back to the others
i dont remember saying that
covers with a joke maybe im insane too
miller follows weir out of the gravity couch bay
i want to know what caused that noise
i want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock
thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly causing reverberations exploding thats bullshit and you know it
you built this fucking ship and all ive heard from you is bullshit
what do you want me to say
you said this ship creates a gateway
where did this ship go
where did you send it
i dont know
where has it been for the past seven years
i dont know
the other place what is that
beat calm again i dont know
theres a lot of things going on here that i dont understand
truth takes time
thats exactly what we dont have doctor
miller moves through the maze of the ship heading for the bridge
as he reaches a junction he hears
dont leave me
miller wheels like a cat staring wildly down the branching corridors
he is alone
miller leans against the wall sinks to the floor rests his head in his hands
the grotesque ship continues its orbit as the moon triton eclipses the sun
darkness swallows all
dj enters checks justins display
dj turns surprised
miller sits barely visible in the dark
beat ive analyzed justins blood samples
theres no evidence of excessive levels of carbon dioxide
or anything else out of ordinary
a grim laugh from miller
of course not
justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it
just one of those things
beat i swore id never lose another man
i came close today
miller nods pulls his service medal from beneath his jumpsuit
it was on the goliath
there was this bosun corrick a young guy a lot like justin
edmund corrick from decatur georgia
he got caught when the pressure doors sealed one closed on his arm
severed it at the wrist
the pain of that must have been
he passed out and
miller trails off
dj waits patiently
finally i i tried to go back for him to save him but i couldnt get to him in time
have you ever seen fire in zero gravity
its like a liquid it slides over everything
it was like a wave breaking over him a wave of fire
and then he was gone
beat i never told anyone until now
but this ship knew dj
it knows about the goliath it knows about corrick
it knows our secrets
it knows what were afraid of
beat wan smile and now youre going to tell me its carbon dioxide
miller sees something in djs expression
what is it
ive been listening to the transmission
and i think houston made a mistake in the translation
dj plays the recording again
stops it abruptly
they thought it said liberatis me save me but its not me
its tutemet save yourself
its not a distress call
its a warning
it gets worse
miller stares at him
its very hard to make out but listen to this final part
he plays the recording again
do you hear it
it sounds like ex infera ex from infera the ablative case of inferi
beat what are you saying are you saying that this ship is possessed
i dont believe in that sort of thing
beat but if dr
weir is right this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe of reality
who knows where this ship has been
what its seen
beat and what its brought back with it
dj looks at miller
he does not have an answer
the intercom intercom captain miller were ready to repressurize the clark
into intercom on my way
miller stands in his eva suit in the darkened bridge
he twists a manual valve
cooper looks at smith
cross your fingers
a moment later mist flows from the vents into the bridge filling it with atmosphere
miller watches the pressure rise on his suit gauge
radio its holding
radio were still venting trace gasses gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole
you got it coop
miller removes his helmet
back in business
peters sits in front of the screen
the log is still distorted
frustrated she types in a series of instructions
get to her feet
you got any coffee
i dont care
behind peters the process refines accelerates
pieces coming together like a jigsaw
peters turns around
sees the screen
the coffee slips from her hand to the floor
tiny voice starck
starck turns sees the screen
miller starck dj watch the video
peters turns away miserable
unable to watch
still distorted by static and roll but finally lucid four original crew of the event horizon
on the bridge
one man dislocates his shoulder with a wet popping sound as he shoves his arm down his own throat
blood bubbles from his nose
with a shucking sound he pulls his stomach out his mouth
behind him a man and woman fuck covered with blood
she bites through his neck
his head lolls to the other side
she buries her face in the torn flesh as he thrusts into her again and again
presiding over them kilpack
his eyes are bloody holes
his hands reach out in offering
in the palms of his hands his eyes
kilpack opens his mouth and speaks with an inhuman voice
liberatis tutemet ex infera
miller switches off the video
no one says anything
you cant your orders are specific
to rescue the crew and salvage the ship
the crew is dead dr
this ship killed them
and now its killing us
youve lost your mind
maybe youre right
but its still my command and i have leeway to abort when i feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew
and i think there is
beat starck download all the files from the event horizons computers
coop smith finish moving the co scrubbers back onto the clark
dont do this
peters enters carrying heavy co scrubbers
smith stops her
whats going on sweethearts
co scrubbers for the clark
miller pulled the plug on the mission
about goddam time
sequence omitted from original script
weir follows miller down the corridor
what about my ship
we will take the lewis and clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the event horizon until i am satisfied that she has been destroyed
beat fuck this ship
you cant do that
miller turns to walk away
weir grabs miller wheeling him around almost frenzied
you cant kill her i wont let you
i lost her once i will not lose her again
miller shoves weir back into the wall
the two stare at each other
the lights cut to emergency lighting
intercom miller come in
miller finds the intercom starck what the hell is going on
starck peers at the engineering board into intercom we just lost main power again
miller and weir are barely visible in the darkness
starck get those files and vacate
i want off this ship
he releases the intercom
weirs voice is a whisper as he backs into the shadows
you cant leave
she wont let you
just get your gear back onto the lewis and clark doctor or youll find yourself looking for a ride home
weir is swallowed by the darkness
i am home
regular lighting snaps on
miller looks around
weir has vanished
he slams the intercom all hands
weir is missing
i want him found and restrained
starck gathers all the files and disks
shuts down the consoles one by one
smith and peters finish removing co scrubbers from panels in the walls
lets go lets go this place freaks me out
peters follows smith down the first containment towards the main access corridor carrying the last case of scrubbers
she begins to lag behind
a giggle echoes down the first containment
she turns back to the second containment
a small figure dashes through the darkness in the second containment
peters turns but smith is already out of sight
moves back towards second containment
again peters hears the giggle of a child
the scrape of metal on metal
she slowly moves forward
into the darkness of the second containment
peters sees an open access panel
she looks inside
a narrow tube vanishing into darkness
a young childs voice echoes from far away mommy
ducks her head and enters the access duct
miller sits at justins engineering position
flips a series of switches
cooper works on the patch as the ships running lights come on in sequence
the bridge lights flicker illuminate
to his ship thank you
radio captain we got a problem
she was right behind me i turn around shes gone
she could be anywhere
prep the clark for launch
ill find her
peters moves through the duct
reaches a junction
anything could be with her there in the dark
a childs whisper too faint for words
behind her foreground a young child dashes across the corridor
peters turns back
too late to see
again the childs whisper draws her onward
denny come to mommy
faint laughter is her only answer
she follows the sound now climbing into a vertical shaft that takes her higher and higher
hold on denny mommys coming
peters pulls herself up from the vertical shaft onto a catwalk that snakes between huge oily machinery just in time to see
a small child running disappearing into the gloom ahead
she runs forward into a junction
the lights flicker red
her son can barely be seen in the flickering darkness ahead
you can walk
denny you can walk
oh my baby
wanna show you mommy wanna show you something
he reaches his arms out to her
peters steps forward reaching for her son
falling into an open access hatch hidden in the dark
a twenty meter drop
peters hits hard lies before the core an offering of flesh and blood
her legs twist beneath her shattered blood pools around her head
her chest heaves still alive
bloody gasp denny
denny peers down from the top of the shaft and giggles
claps his hands in childlike glee
weir wanders into first containment brooding
to himself i wont
i wont leave
this is my ship
weir enters the second containment
freezes as he sees
peters body lying twisted and broken before the core
he rushes to peters
reaches out to touch her but pulls his hand back
her eyes are black eight ball hemorrhage darkening the irises
she is dead
why did you do that
you didnt have to do that
weir looks up from peters corpse
claire stands before the core
she is naked
her skin is pale and beautiful and cold and wet
her hair hangs in her face covering her milk white eyes
claire stands naked before the bathroom mirror
behind her the tub steams
weir stares at claire in shock
she walks to him
she stops in front of him
her arms hang at her sides
he must reach for her
he does putting his hands on her hips
he slides from his chair to the floor to his knees
he presses his face to her pale belly and cries
sobs wrack his body
and in the bathroom she clutches weirs straight razor
she reaches down
slowly her arms cradle his head
she slides down on him
claire slips into the steaming water
he raises his head to her breasts
his eyes closed
she remains unnaturally still only her hips rocking back and forth
weirs mouth opens gasps as he enters her
and the razor bites her skin
she caresses his face
lifts his face to hers
her mouth is slack
her hair hangs in front of her eyes
claire floats dead in the red water eyes open hair billowing around her head like a halo
weir gazes up at her transfixed
he takes her hand and raises it to his face
she caresses his cheek
and reaches for his eyes
a muffled scream rips through the second containment seal
it begins as a human sound and ends as something else an alien cry of rage
the cry echoes down the main corridor
dj packs up blood samples
he raises his head at the sound of the cry
starck gasps as the cry resounds through the bridge
miller turns in the direction of the cry
he begins to move down the corridor towards the source
cooper examines the weld on the baffle plate
solid as a rock
into his radio hey smith
intercom smith clear that airlock man im coming in
smith carries another load of supplies
movement out of the corner of his eye
he turns in time to see weir disappear around a corner inside the event horizon
hey get your ass back on board
smith keys the radio
skipper come in
miller jogs down the main corridor
an intercom gets his attention intercom skipper
into intercom what is it smith
intercom i just saw weir i think he was messing around on the clark
something sparks and sizzles in the dim light catching millers eye
he looks up
one of the explosive charges has been removed from the its mounting in the corridor
smith get out of there
intercom come again skipper
one of the explosives is missing from the corridor
i think weir may have put it on the clark
smiths eyes open wide
intercom get off the clark now and wait for me at the airlock
no no we just got her back together
intercom get out of there now
but smith has already left the airlock
entering the quarters tearing through storage lockers
where is it where is it
miller races down the corridor towards the airlock towards his ship
a beeping sound catches smiths attention
he follows the sound to a storage compartment
rifles through it
the beeps are coming closer and closer together
smith grabs a duffel
he sees the explosive charge from the event horizon even as the beeps become a steady tone
he closes his eyes and sighs
miller enters the docking bay even as a huge blast knocks him back
safety doors close sealing off the airlock and preventing loss of pressure
the silent explosion tears the lewis and clark into two pieces spiralling away from each other and from the event horizon
metal shards like confetti fill the space between them
cooper clings to the forward section watching the event horizon recede as he tumbles into space
his frenzied breathing is the only sound
miller gets to his feet
stares out the window upon the wreckage of his ship spiralling away
he hits the intercom with his forearm
the clarks gone
smith and cooper are dead
he used one of the explosives from the corridor
the door opens behind dj
the lights go out
face to face with weir
blood crusts weirs cheekbones his mouth
he has no eyes
only clotted empty sockets
dj opens his mouth to scream
weir grabs dj by the throat cutting him off
dj you read me
dj does not answer
the crash of glass and steel resonates over the intercom
too dark to see
glimpses of violent motion in the stainless steel cabinets
the sounds of struggle continue
then something wet
and the struggle stops
dj come in
finally weir emerges from the gloom
he searches among the surgical instruments until his blood caked hands find a needle
miller at the intercom
he tries another channel
peters body lies before the core
the intercom crackles
intercom peters are you there
growing panic starck do you read me
but it is weir who answers
his voice sounds thick choked with dirt
intercom i told you
she wont let you leave
son of a bitch
miller yanks open a storage locker full of zero g tool
lifts a nailgun
chambers a round
cooper watches the event horizon fall farther and farther away
he checks his oxygen gauge
one tank full one tank at half
cooper twists his backpack around giving him access to the oxygen tanks
he seals off his primary hose and disconnects the full tank
his gauge immediately goes to yellow reserve
cooper points the full tank away from the event horizon and the blast of pressurized air pushes him towards the ship leaving the wreckage of the lewis and clark behind
miller races through the corridors to medical
and finds dj suspended above the table neatly dissected
his organs have been laid out carefully before him on the steel table
oh my god
dj raises his head
oh god dj what do i
how do please
miller raises the nailgun with trembling hands
miller approaches the door to the bridge
it is open
miller stands in the doorway
a figure sits at the helm
miller aims the nailgun
the figure doesnt move
miller slowly circles around the helm
bound with wire in a sadomasochistic pose unconscious
get you outta these
miller kneels in front of her puts down the nailgun loosens the cords
she breathes in ragged gasps opens his eyes
she stares over millers shoulder like a deer caught in the headlights
miller looks behind him
miller reaches for the gun
weir hits him sending miller across the bridge into a bulkhead
weir picks up the nailgun examines it
miller slowly gets to his feet
i dont need them anymore
where were going we wont need eyes to see
what are you talking about
do you know what a singularity is miller
does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is
beat it is nothing
absolute and eternal nothing
and if god is everything then i have seen the devil
a dead mans grin its a liberating experience
with his free hand weir reaches for the navigation console
flips a series of switches with gore caked fingers
the display lights up
gravity drive primed
do you wish to engage
what are you doing
weir grins as he flips the final switch
gravity drive engaged
activation in t minus ten minutes
miller lunges for the nailgun
weir raises the nailgun to point at millers face
miller slowly backs away
if you miss me youll blow out the hull
youll die too
what makes you think ill miss
miller sees something out of the corner of his eye
outside braced in the viewport bracket
weir spins and fires at cooper
the nail lodges in the thick quartz glass
a web of cracks spreads out from the bullet the glass shrieking under the pressure
weir takes a step towards the window raises the gun to fire again
miller dives for the door
before weir can fire the window explodes outward
the ship howls as air rushes out ripping weir off his feet
weir catches himself in the broken window trying to pull himself back in
a monitor tears free smashes into him
he is sucked out
miller pulls himself through the door as it begins to shut
he is safe
dont leave me
starck clings to a console barely able to resist the winds that try to suck her into the void
gasping for air please
help help me
miller hesitates looking from starck back into the safety of the ship
the door continues to shut
in seconds he will be safe
and she will be dead
miller yells and rips a compressor from its mount wedges it in the door to keep it open
he keeps one hand on the door reaches the other hand to starck
give me your hand
frost forms on their bodies as the air cools
their veins begin to bulge blood pulses from their noses
he yells with exertion
drags her to the door
through the door
as the compressor tears free sucked into space
and the door snaps shut missing them by a fraction
starck and miller collapse against the door
a moment passes between them
just happy to be breathing
and then the airlock klaxon goes off
the forward airlock
starck and miller race towards the forward airlock bay
they enter see a humanoid shape moving in the strobing light of the airlock
weir cant be alive
whatever was on that bridge wasnt weir
miller looks around for a weapon
pulls a zero g bolt cutter from the wall
wields it like a bat
stay behind me
the inner airlock door releases with a hiss
cooper tumbles through clawing at his helmet
starck rushes to him takes his helmet off
he sucks air in coughs it out
let me breathe let me breathe
youre okay now its over
sees something its not over
its just starting
starck follows millers gaze to a workstationss flashing display gravity drive engaged
weir activated the drive
hes sending us to the other place
weve got to shut it down weve got to
the bridge is gone
there must be a way
what about engineering
can you shut it down
i dont know the process dr
weir was the expert
i dont want to go where the last crew went
id rather be dead
blow it up
we blow the corridor
use the foredecks as a lifeboat separate it from the rest of the ship
we stay put
and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before
you prep the gravity couches
im going to manually arm those explosives
will it work
it worked for weir
prep the tanks
cooper nods heads for the gravity couch bay
starck follows miller to the steel pressure door
ill do it no
ill be right back
miller opens the door
close it behind me
just in case
starck stares at miller as if memorizing his face
dont be long
miller smiles wanly
the door slides shut with a dull thunk
miller runs down the corridor
stops at a bulkhead coupling
kneels down to remove the cover from an explosive charge switch it to manual detonation
miller runs to the next coupling
repeats the process
starck and cooper check the gravity couches
one by one they slide open
im gonna activate the emergency beacon
cooper exits down a ladder
starck turns to the console activates three gravity couches
behind her two begin to fill with blue gel
and one begins to fill with blood
the hint of dark shapes moving within
starck doesnt see it concentrates on the console
sees the bloody tank
sees something moving inside it
she slowly crosses to the tank
peers at it
bone and muscle are exposed where the skin hasnt finished forming
starck screams and backs away
the glass bursts in an explosion of blood
a corridor beneath the gravity couch bay
cooper searches through circuit panels until he finds the emergency beacon breaker
he runs a by pass activating it manually
the lights begins to strobe
a bloodstain spreads over his shoulder
he follows the drip to the ceiling
he slowly moves to peer up the ladder
as starck crashes down bloody but alive
she shoves him away
weir appears at the top of the ladder crawling down headfirst like a spider
starck gets to her feet staggers away
miller kneels removing the cover from the last explosive
flips a switch
a small cover pops open
miller reaches in removes a radio he arms the explosives
watches the red lights on the explosives wink on in the darkness
he reaches for an intercom
this fuckers ready to blow
intercom repeat were armed
miller hes back he was in the tank
slow down starck i cant understand you who was in the tank
a figure seems to coalesce from the shadows behind miller
intercom you have to get back here now hes out there now if he finds you
the figure moves forward into the light
arcane runes etch weirs face his eyes now restored blaze with unholy zeal
miller glances over his shoulder
his jaw drops in surprise as he sees
weir grinning at him
then smashes the intercom with his fist cutting off starcks voice
miller backs away
weir stands between miller and safety
youre dead i saw you die
weir is dead
then who the fuck are you
do you remember the goliath miller
do you remember me
you left me behind
thats not true
i begged you
i begged you to save me and you did nothing
you stood there and watched me burn
the burning man yells and raises his arm in accusation
and fire races out from behind him flowing over the walls the ceiling the floor racing for miller like a rising tide
dead ahead the first containment
miller runs fast
the fire is faster flooding in behind him
miller dashes for the second seal as it begins to close
the fire gains on him surrounding him
miller dives through the second seal
barely makes it
slams into the engineering console
miller looks back at the second seal
its still open by a fraction when the fire hits it
sending a lance of flame stabbing out towards miller
he rolls aside as the fire hits the console
the console the second seal shuts tight cutting the fire off
the paint on the second seal begins to bubble and scorch
and then cools as the fire subsides
miller gets to his feet
almost allows himself to relax
then he sees his shadow before him dancing in the growing red light
the second containment is a holocaust
fire swarms over the walls
burning jelly drips from control spikes
the core itself is a blazing orb the gyroscope that holds it glows red hot
miller stares at the blazing core
dont leave me
the burning man stands right beside him
he smashes miller with a backhand that ignites millers clothes and sends him flying
the detonator falls from millers grasp lost beneath two feet of coolant
miller comes up choking and spluttering
the burning man stalks towards miller
the coolant steams and sizzles at his feet
miller stares at the burning man as he approaches
slowly rises to his feet
youre not edmund corrick
the burning mans flames wane revealing weirs misshapen form
miller throws a wicked right
weir catches millers fist
squeezes until blood wells up between his fingers
then slings miller against a cooling tank with bone cracking force
miller collapses into the slime barely able to raise his head to breathe
weir slowly approaches
what are you
you want me to believe youre the devil well i dont thats bullshit
im not the devil
then what what are you
better if i just show you
weirs hands reach down and he grabs miller by the skull
miller gasps as he sees
faster than the eye can see
more than mind can accept
the original crew writhe naked and bloody in carnivorous frenzy
peters bloody grinning child devouring his mother
miller writhes in weirs grip
his hands flail out to the sides
one hand brushes a long steel cannister sunk in the muck
a co scrubber
djs dissected body except that here dj looks up and smiles
an alien sun red and bloated and dying
an alien terrain a sluggish oily black sea
a hand reaches from the oil
claire floating dead in a bathtub filled with the thick black fluid
justin starck and cooper crucified upside down upon the third seal
his hand closes on the scrubber and he swings it across weirs head
weir reels back stunned
miller gets to his feet
you cant have them
he hits weir again
blood gushes from weirs skull filling the runes on his face
again and again and again
this time weir is ready
he catches the scrubber and tears it from millers grasp
smashes miller to the floor with a single blow
im not the devil
im much much older
i watched the beginning and i will see the end
i am the dark behind the stars
i am the dark inside you all
miller gets to all fours trying to get up
not the devil
weir kicks miller savagely
miller slides through the coolant comes to rest beneath a walkway
he attempts to rise collapses back into the sludge
weir slowly stalks towards him
there is no devil
there is no god
there is only
im not asking you to believe me
youll see for yourself
and so will your crew
youre all coming with me
weirs grotesque face is inches from his
he reaches down and pulls miller from the dripping ooze
they are mine
and so are you
as miller clears the surface he holds something in his fist
miller stares dead on into weirs hellish face
and raises his right hand
hes holding the detonator
a grim smile of triumph you cant have them
go to hell
a small silent explosion blossoms in the aft section of the ship
followed frames later by a sequence of detonations that rip the main access corridor apart and propel the foredecks away from the containment section
the explosion knocks starck and cooper down
they hold on tightly as
waves of distortion ripple over the event horizons containment section
a dark sphere of energy spreads out from the containment as the gateway opens
a black hole
the black hole begins to shrink imploding
as it collapses it sucks neptunes blue clouds with it creating a titanic whirlpool with the black hole at its center
the shrieking winds carry the foredecks back towards the whirlpool towards the black hole
cooper and starck slide across the floor as the deck tips at a terrific angle
the foredecks teeter on the edge of oblivion
the black hole collapses utterly vanishing to a point
an enormous shockwave rips out from the point of implosion
the foredecks ride the wave away from the implosion and out of neptunes atmosphere to safety
the vibrations subside
cooper and starck stagger to their feet
look out the window
neptune recedes the ugly hole of the implosion already being erased by neptunes violent winds
starcks voice is tiny
black planets silhouetted by a dying red giant
the engineering containment of the event horizon drifts in the eddies of gas that swirl and spiral into the bloated star
move towards the ship until its shadow consumes all
starck awakens but the screams continue as the event horizon calls out to her
hands on her body
the cries stop
starck looks around uncomprehending at the faces around her
cooper pushes them aside
she clings to him crying
its over hush now its over
