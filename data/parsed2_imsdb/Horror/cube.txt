b if window
href b b at first we see an eye
closed and slowly it opens up and looks around
later we get a full view of a man lying on the floor in a strange looking room
walls ceiling floor
sides just like a cube
there is a kind of door on each side
each door has a handle
on the walls are weird looking pictures
they doesnt seem to look like anything seen before
the man stands up in the middle of the room
the camera pans around him
then he makes some sounds and opens a door in one of the walls
as he looks in to the open door he sees a new room like the one he is located in but the light in the new room is blue
he turns around and the door closes by itself
then he opens the door in in the floor
under that door theres a new room excatly like the first but in this room the light is red
the door closes
he opens a new door in one of the walls
the light in there is red
he looks back and then crawls into the new room
as he lands on the floor in the new room it makes a loud sound and then the door closes behind him
he takes one step and then there is a loud sound
the man stands still
slowly he begins to bleed and slowly his body begins to fall apart
as the last parts of his body hits the floor we see a sort of trelliswork
first it moves to the floor and afterwards it is being folded up
a man lies on the floor
a door is open beside him
slowly we see a hand trying to find something to hold on to
a man crawls up from the hole
quentin closes the door in the floor
he sits down beside the man lying on the floor and tries to wake him
quentin stands up and opens a door in one of the walls
he looks into a new room
he closes the door again
the man from before is now awake
we hear a sound from one of the other doors in the walls
quentin stands beside the door preparing to attack whatever that comes out from there
as someone looks out quentin grabs her by the neck throws her to the floor and tries to beat her until he realises that it is a lady
the lady screams and sits down in a corner of the room
its alright im not gonna hurt you
what do you want
i thought you were
i dont know
we hear a loud sound and everybody in the room looks around
as the sound stops someone screams for help
quentin opens a door real fast
as the camera switches to a new angle we see a girl in a red room screaming for help
when she sees quentin she walks towards him
quentin crawls into the room
its ok come here
quentin helps leaven into the room where the others are located
holloway helps leaven out but not good enough because leaven falls and drops her glasses
leaven sits up against a wall and quentin comes towards her
its ok calm down evrythings gonna be fine
what was in there
just give me a minute to figure things out
why are you afraid of that room
just give me a minute i said
the door in the ceiling is being opened
we see an old man
how many people are in this thing
we cant go climbing around in here
what do you mean traps
i looked into a room down there and something almost cut my head off
the old man crawls down to the others while quentin talks about the traps
leaven breathes heavily
holy god holy holy god
the old man sits down and begins to untie his shoe
leaven suddenly hugs quentin
holloway sits down beneath worth
are you alright
holloway gets the attention from worth
i hit my head
let me take a look at that
its ok im a doctor it doesnt look bad
the old man stands up
what the hell are you doing
the old man opens a door and now looks into a blue room
hey old man
the old man rennes throws his boot into the room
an incinerator quickly burns the boot
rennes pulls the boot back and then the door closes
rennes drops the boot on the floor
motiondetectors integrated in the walls
tough to spot
oh god oh god oh god
rennes is on his way to open a new door
wait a second
lets all just relax for a minute
does anybody remember how they got here
long nervebreaking silence
i was eating dinner
perogies cheese and potato
i ran out of sour cream and then i went to the fridge and then i
i dont know
i just went to bed and then what about you
i just woke up here
middle of the night
its like chile
they always come in the middle of the night
only the government can build something this ugly
oh it aint government
then what is it
i dont know
please were spooked anough as it is
lets rule out aliens from now on and concentrate on what we know
my moms gonna freak
just wont be there
what do you think rennes
we dont solve the act sitting still
im moving at this straight line till i get to the end
alright i attend to agree
shouldnt we wait here
to see if anybody comes
no one is gonna come
theres a way in here so theres gotta be a way out
we can avoid the traps using the boot
holloway is it
what do you think
for an exit
it cant be that simple
it aint gonna be that simple
take a look around
take a good long look around see it
coz i got a feeling its looking at us
i just wanna wake up
leaven blinks with her eyes several times
quentin sits down beneath her
leaven we can do this
we just have to stay calm and work together as a team
theres gotta be a lot of people looking for us on the outside
im a cop alright
youre a cop
im gonna get you out of here i promise but you gotta be with me on this one
rennes opens a new door waiting for quentin to give signal boot it
rennes throws the boot nothing happens
through several times of boot throwing we see other rooms with other colors on the walls
on the way to a new green room leaven notice some numbers in the passage between two rooms
a loud sound is to hear
that one sounded closer
seems to come at regular intervals
maybe its the ventilationsystem
no kidding im boiling leaven looks at the numbers again
above these numbers are some others
what is it serial numbers
room numbers theyre different in each room
oh great so theres only million
rooms in this thing
thered better not be
we have about three days without food and water before were too weak to move
they have to feed us dont they
oh we have heat stress physical exhaustion i
dehydration headaches dizziness disorientation confusement
the body eventual begins to break down its own tissue
rennes rips a button of holloways shirt
suck on it
keeps the saliva flowing
again the boot lands in a new room
this time its red
the air seems dry in there
molecular chemical sensor
why the hell didnt the boot set it off
the boots not alive
it detects hydrogen sulfide extruded from the skin
how come you know so much about sensors renz
fine youre french
im asking how
rennes opens a new door and throws the boot
with the right age
i dont believe it
this guy is the wren
the bird of attica
through the coop on six major prisons
youre kidding right
you can get us out
yes im harry fucking houdini
the only reason i dragged you so far is cause i need your boots
if youre not smarting up im gone like that
no more talking
no more guessing
dont even think about something which is not right in front of ya
thats the real challenge you gotta save yourselves from yourselves
rennes jumps into the new room
we hear a click
rennes gets acid in the face
he screams and the door closes
in the other room the door begins to open
get him out
rennes head is partly dissolved
he screams quietly because he has blood in his mouth
the others scream too
they lay him in a corner
after a little while they look to him again
hes dead most of his head his been dissolved
so it was electrochemical or whatever right
and he missed it
thats great thats fucking great
quentin turns the corpse of rennes around with a foot
its time to reassess this place
ive been over it again and again why would they throw innocent people in here
are we being punished
ive never done anything to deserve this
forget about all that
you cant see the big picture from in here
so dont try
keep your head down
keep it simple
just look look at whats in front of you
thats what he said
start with us
we got an escapeartist and a cop
theres gotta be a reason for that
youre a doctor holloway
that gives you a function a reason right
no it just makes me go why me and not one of the ten million other doctors out there
what are you
nothing i jst go to school hang out with my friends
there is nothing else
my parents are these people i live with them
i think we have to ask the big questions what does it want
what is it thinking
one down four to go
why dont you tell us what your purpose is worth
ive wondered that myself
im just a guy i work in an officebuilding doing officebulding stuff
i wasnt actually bursting joie de vivre before i got here
life just sucks in general
i cant stand that attitude
because hes right
what s your purpose quentin
three of them
i havent made my piece yet
im getting out of here no matter what
thats where my strength comes from
you people find yours wherever you got it
for christs sake
what do you live for
dont you have a wife or a girlfriend or something
nope i got a pretty nice collection of pornography nice nice
i aint got anyone either but im not giving up
im pissed off
the came into our homes
they stripped us bare
they took my rings
they took my
i wanna know whos responsible
leaven your glasses
you dont need them
only for reading
well they took off her jewelry but they must have put these on you
if nothing is random
why are they here
quentin opens a door in the wall
we see three numbers
on the other side theres the numbers
leaven what do you read in school
what can they mean
leaven takes the glasses and begins to study the numbers
leaven opens a new door
the numbers we see are xxx primenumbers
i cant believe i didnt see it before
it seems like if any of these numbers of prime then the room is trapped
thats not prime
wait x its not prime either
so that room is safe
wait wait wait
how can you make that decision based on one primenumbertrap
the incinerator thing was prime
the molecularchemical thing had the acidroom had
youd remembered all that in your head
i have a facility for it
leaven you beautiful brain
holloway throws the boot
ok out of the way
brains before beauty
leaven jumps into the room
the camera pans around for some time
first we see the numbers then we see leaven thinking
how long have we been in here nine or ten hours
we see a door closing
then we see leaven rubbing her eyes
how do you know
o clock stubble
the last thing i remember was shaving
i guess i missed breakfeast
or whatever now dont worry
ill be home in time for dinner
if we get out il make you dinner
you got a date
quentin opens a door and leaven looks at the numbers inside
i need to smoke
i could smoke a butt of a sidewalk
just real yourself in a bit
were moving along things are looking up
youre right i quitted smoking years ago
i just need to be occupied
talk to me
have a conversation
what kind of doctor are you anyway
uh you know the free kinda
er come on help me
tell me about your rugrats
we have three boys
nine seven and five
oh good god
theres no way id survived that
she didnt either
shes not dead were just separated
im sorry i cant just shoot the breeze
these numbers arent prime
excuse me sorry
you could try and help me out here buddy
no i couldnt the group crawls into the new room
shortly afterwards they are in a green room with everyone looking down in a new room
this one is trapped too
quentin closes the door
we have to backtrack
quentin looks up
everyone looks up on the door
the quentin looks at leaven
read them to me
quentin takes of his shirt
leaven is ready to hold it
what are you
quentin begins to crawls up to the door
as he wants to open the door he says its stuck
as quentin opens the door a guy falls down and almost hits leaven
quentin jumps down and the new guy stands up
this room is green
kazan begins to knock his head into the wall
holloway now looks at kazan
holloway puts a hand on kazans forehead
this room is green
yes it is
i wanna go back to the blue room
is it shock or what
i think hes mentally handicapped
i like the blue room
he almost broke my neck
hey there are you all alone
do you wanna hold my hand honey
butter first then honey kazan
butter first then honey
how did he survive
i wanna go back to the blue room
theres lots of blue rooms
well find another one to you real soon
this is just way too bizarre
will you just worry about your own numbers
leaven looks molested
go on ill look after him
leaven points at the ceiling
since he almost fell on my head
shall we go for a walk
kazan do you wanna go for a walk
as quentin begins to crawl up to the door
kazan gets terrified
he hits himself with the one hand on his head
lets not make him do the climbing thing right away
the screen fades and next time we see something is in a new room where kazan opens a new door
could they have taken us all the way to new mexico
what are you talking about holloway
im talking about where do you hide something this big
it has at least got to fill something
holloway stands walks over to quentin and stands beside him
im sorry to shake your foundations quentin but you have no idea where your tax dollars go
free clinic doctors
only the military industrial complex can afford to build something this size
holloway whats the military industrial complex
have you ever been there
im tellin you its not that complex
and how would you know from where you are
what do you think these establishments is
its just guys like me
their desks are bigger but their jobs arent
they dont conspide they
no this place is
the bad guy in the man with the golden gun
its some rich psycos entertainment
is that what you think
holloway crawls into the passage
ok youre a cop
single bullet theory
as holloway lands in the new room she starts to lose her breath
it seems like shes being choken
get back here
but holloway stays where she is
i just swallowed my button
i hate this
i hate this
your boys having a conniption sitting there
a door is being opened
its like creme without coffee
she needs a break
she can do it
holloway crawls into kazan and makes him touch her hair
and then back to the other room
they dont look prime to me
is that your two bits worth worth
of course its what is worth
well hes right
quentin jumps into the new room
in front of you
a lot of wires or whatever is being shot down from the ceiling and the slowly surrounds quentin rotates and quentin just jumps away before he gets split up into
but it wasnt without pain
quentin gets cut on one of his legs
what is it
quentin gets back into the room
the door closes
i dont know what happened
it wasnt prime
quentin hold still
somebody stop that rackets
leave the boots
worth joins kazan to make him shut up
and shut the fucking door
the door closes
i had a feeling about that fucking guy
he knew about that trap
but these numbers arent prime
then your numbersystem failed but he knew
how could he know
youre the paranoid think about it
his only function so far is to kick us when were down
so he has a bad attitude
so you think that makes him spy
trust me on this its my job to read people like an x ray
the door opens and worth comes in with kazan
worth holds him for his eyes
he doesnt like red rooms
worth makes kazan sit by himself
so what happened
pmfh you saw what happened
i guess the numbers are more complicated than i thought
maybe they mean nothing at all
no it means theyre more involved the works for us up to now have just been bad i just need more time with them
we need to rest anyway
well thats handy like if there was nothing fucking else we could do
the camera fades
next time we see leaven writing some numbers on a piece of metal
are they telling you anything
theyre not tarot cards
do you have any idea on how many variables i have to consider before i can decide from numbers this size
they dont reveal themselves right away
theyre like people
kazan pulls down his pants to pee
erm not here honey over in the corner
everybody looks at him
well hes just peeing
now it totally reeks in here
and you find this all pretty funny dont you
quentin goes really close to worth
whats your fucking problem worth
even holloways holding up better than you
get over there and help her with him
thats your job babysitter
somebody has to taka responsibility around here
and that somebody has to be you
not all of us have a luxury of playing nihilists
not all of us are conceded enough to play hero
its the will to live everybodys got it worth even you especially you hiding behind that cynical front
the will to live
thats the warm coasy feeling deep inside
thanks partner im a new man
arh poor worth nobody loves me
if thats the chip on your shoulders then why did you lug it all this way
why didnt you just lie down and die
quentin opens the door to the trap from before
show us you have some backbone and jump into the sushimachine
be a man
everybodys waiting for worth to answer
finally worth stands up
fuck you quentin
i dont wanna die im just being realistic
do you think they just builded this thing so we could just walk out of it
do you think they would lay clues if there wasnt a way out
you think we matter we dont put us out of your misery so we can get on and get out of here
oh youre not getting out
yes we are
there is no way outta here
long and nervebreaking silence
do you know
answer the question worth
who are you
i am the poison
i designed the outer shell
the shell the sarcophagus
you builded this thing
not this part the exterior
i dont know anything about the numbers or anything else in here
i was contracted to draw plans for a hollow shell
why didnt you tell us
for gods sake worth
you knew what it was
whos beyond it
i dont know
who hired you
i didnt ask
i never even left my office
i talked on the phone to some other guys like me
specialists working on small details
nobody knew what it was
you knew from square one
look at him hes up to his eyeballs in this thing
thats how they stay hidden
you keep everyone separated so the left hand doesnt know what the right hand is doing
the brain never comes out in the open
its all the same machine right
if you do one little job
you build a widget in saskatoon
the next thing you know its two miles under the desert the essential component of a deathmachine
i was right
all along my whole life i knew it
i told you quentin
nobodys ever call me paranoid again
we gotta get out of here and blow the lid of this thing
holloway you dont get it
then tell me please i need to know
its maybe hard for you to understand but theres no conspiracy
nobody is in charge
its a headless blunder operating under the illusion of a masterplan
can you grasp that
big brother is not watching you
what kind of fucking explanation is that
its the best you re gonna get
i looked and the only explanation i can come to is that there is nobody up there
somebody had to say yes to this thing
only we know what it is
we have no idea what it is
we know more than anybody else
i mean somebody might have known sometime before they got fired or voted out or sold it
but if this place ever had a purpose then it got miscommunicated or lost in the shuffle
this is an accident a forgotten propetual public worksproject
do you think anybody wants to ask questions
all they want is a clear conscience and a fat paycheck
i mean i lead on my desk for months
this was a great job
why put people in it
because its here
you have to use it or admit its pointless
but it is pointless
thats my point
what have we come to
its so much worse than i thought
not really just more pathetic
you make me sick worth
i make me sick too
we re both part of the system
i drew a box you walk a beat
its like you said quentin is keep your head down keep it simple just look at whats in fron of you
i mean nobody wants to see the big picture
lifes too complicated
i mean lets face it
the reason were here is its out of control
quentin turns around
is that how were ruining the world
have you been on glue all of your life
i felt guilty for ruining the world since i was like
if you need someone to blame throw a rock
now i feel better
thats why you stayed with us
still looking for someone to bust quentin
quentin turns around again and begins to beat worth
quentin quentin stop it
leaven grabs quentins arm
we need him
have you gone absolutely mad
hes the only one who knows nything about the place
worth falls to the ground
quentin walks away
so theres this outer shell
and its a cube like this
i assume so
are there any doors
theres one door
wherever the doorguy put it
six guesses and its sealed from the outside
what are the dimensions of the outer shell
leaven starts to take steps inside the room until she gets to kazan
the inner cube cannot be flushed by the shell
there is a space
i dont know
it makes sense
well the biggest the cube then can be is
rooms heigh rooms across so
oh god that makes me queasy
leaven opens a new door and puts on her glasses
leaven you are a genius
we see three numbers cartesian co ordinates of course coded cartesian co ordinates
they are uses in geometry to plot points on a three dimensional graph
bonjour these numbers are markers a grid referance like altitude and longitude on a map
the numbers tell us where we are inside the cube
then where are we
ok all i have to do now is add the numbers together
the x co ordinate is y is rooms
so that places us
seven rooms from the edge
alright lets go
just out of curuiosity
i mean dont hit me again or anything
but what are you gonna do when you get there
maybe we can get the door open
what we need to do is figure out how we get around the traps
im dealing with that holloway
im looking for practical solutions here
well you havent found any yet
we cut the risk with the numbers and the boot
worth will go in first
no he wont quentin we take turns
the camera fades
the first we see is someone nervous playing with his hers button
is there room for two in there
quentin crawls in to leaven
whats the matter
these co ordinates
what about them
well they dont make sense
assuming the cube is rooms across there cant be a co ordinate larger than
if that was right then we would be outside the cube
leaven looks up and looks around
no not outside the cube
i guess that means were not having dinner
the camera fades
first we see the group opening the door in the floor
trap trap trap
we see a blue room
just after kazan says trap the last time
a lot of spears come out from the walls until the room is filled with spears
in the end the spears go back again
the spears come again and goes away in the end
whispers its soundactivated
the spears come and goes away
they close the door
how come the sound of the door opening didnt set it off
must be reat to ignore it
so thats it
the edge is surrounded by traps
well i guess we have to backtrack and try somewhere else
who knows how many detours well have to take
i say we cross the bitch
how many boots do we have left holloway
they look at kazans feet
just one boot left
get it off him
we know how it works we just have to be quiet
pretty fucking quiet
im glad youre on sight worth because youre up
kazan makes a sound
and hes not coming
of course he is
youre not leaving him behind
when we get to the edge we can come back for him but he will get somebody killed here
am i right
shame on you
will you look at yourselves
what have you turned into
they may have taken our lives away but were still human beings
thats all weve got left
well come back for him
thats a lie and you know it
hell be quiet
quentin opens the door and puts worth down there
he hangs in the ceiling by himself now with a boot in his mouth
he crawls down the wall
meanwhile we hear something nearby
as its no longer is to hear
worth opens a door nothing happens and crawls in
leaven is up next
next is kazan
as leaven is in worth and holloway stands on the floor
kazan crawls in the ceiling and afterwards he crawls the wrong way
holloway goes to get him
suddenly his pants are stuck in the handle on the floor
holloway tries to unloose it
next up is quentin
now all is in except quentin
he is on his way
in the floor the door is opening
so quentin hurries up and arent safe as the handle stops turning
he waits to be speared
now the spears come again quentin just makes it into the passage
now we are in a red room
quentin grabs kazan and almost beats him
you fucking fuck
hes a trap
let him go right now
law of the jungle holloway
hes a danger in the pack
let him go you nazi
quentin lets go of kazan
what did you call me
you let that innocent boy go
you listen to me woman
every day i mop up after your bleeding heart
the only reason why you exist is because i keep you
i know your type
no kids no man to fuck you
so you go around outraged sticking your nose up in other peoples assholes sniffing their business
you missed your boat holloway
you are all dry up inside there arent you
thats your fucking problem
the others look shocked
how dare you say that to her
you dont know her quentin
none ouf us know eachother here
oh i do
no you dont
no wonder your wife left you
all that bottled up anger
and a thing for young girls
quentin slaps holloway in the face
he looks insulted
god help you quentin
did you smack your kids around too
is anybody besides me interested in whats on the other side of that door
door number six not door number one door number two
open the fucking thing
worth opens the door
now we see something completely black
only with a little light from rooms below and on the other sides
its the edge the shell
my old friend the shell
worth crawls into the passage
now we hear a gigantic echo
hang on to me
quentin crawls in and worth crawls into the room again
cant see shit
nothing to hang on to
quentin crawls back
we have to try something
we gotta see if the doors over there
someone has to swing over there and take a look
we make a rope of our clothes
take it off
ill tie it onto myself
yeah youre gonna go
you weigh like pounds itll snap in two seconds
im the lightest
im going holloway
shes right quentin youre too heavy
im the lightest after leaven
anyways its my turn
as quentin ties the clothes holloway and worth talks together
how long did you know people were put in here
a couple of months
thats not long if you consider your whole life
you opened my eyes worth that s something
and such a helen
holloway begins to crawl outside the room
shes almost crying
thats as far as you go
theres nothing down here
ill try swinging over there
place yourself im gonna try again
ok one more time
hurry youre getting heavy
third time holloway tries to swing over to the shell theres a big crash
the others now drops the grip of the rope
quentin just reaches the end of the rope as holloway is falling
the others graps quentins feet as he is almost out fo the room too
what the hell is going on
get up here now
holloway crawls up
in the end quentin can reach her arm
first quentin smiles holloway smiles too
but then quentin looks someway different
holloway knows what is going to happen
do you got her
whats going on
is she ok
quentin drops holloway and crawls back into the room
leaven sits down i a corner
quentin walks over to her
come on kazan
kazan will you please stop doing that
leaven you gotta be strong sweetheart
dont even talk to me
we gotta get down to the bottom
itll be easier to get on to shell from there
its a long fucking way with only one boot
but we gotta do it before we get too weak
you gotta keep cracking the numbers leaven
i cant think anymore
sure you can
its your gift
its not a gift its just a brain
let her sleep for a while
we havent slept for fucking hours
ok one hour
how the fuck are you gonna know how long an hour is
an hour is as long as i say
the group go to sleep
in the background weird music is to hear
after a little while we see someone taking the boot away from worth
then we see a hand holding leaven for the mouth
then quentin is bending towards leaven and afterwards we see him carry leaven
the next we see is a door closing
what are you doing
we have to make it down to the bottom
therell be quiet there and you can concentrate
do you just wanna leave them
we are the key
i get us down there
you think us out
believe in me
try to see what i see how my mind works
when i look into someones head like a fucking x ray
i looked through the walls
i dreamed him at his desk designing everything
he cant let you solve the puzzle
there is a purpose
we are the purpose
the cube is us
quentin begins to touch leaven
we fit like numbers
a man and a woman
two halves of the equation
i take you down
the perfect key
quentin goes further and tries to touch her breasts
ill slip you on the lock
leaven runs away
quentin stands up
its time to go down
quentin tries to catch her
meanwhile a door is being opened
worth comes jumping hitting quentin to the floor
kazan enters the room too
the door closes
get away from her
leaven theyre fucking spys
him the retard
holloway had outside information about my family
she went too far
you dropped her
just go quentin give us the boot you pig
quentin turns around and suddenly hits worth with the boot
then he walks towards leaven
you dont want the boot
then quentin again hits worth several times
afterwards he opens the door in the floor
you wanna come with us worth
down the hatch
quentin throws worth down the hole in the floor
as worth hits the floor he starts laughing
what the fucks with him
the others crawl down to worth
he lies on the door on the handle
as the camera switches angle we see a corpse with the face down
quentin turns the corpse with his foot
quentin drops the boot
how does he
laughing its the wren the old renster
laughing weve been going in circles that cant be
quentin grabs leaven and opens a door
where are we
i dont know
where are we
you figure it out
you havent done anything
all you do is freak out
leaven starts crying
worth stands up and laughs
quentin sits down
you were right worth
there is no outta here
quentin starts crying
kazan comes and touches his hair
crying get away from me
worth stands up
wasnt rennes killed in that room
worth opens the door to were rennes was killed
all we see is black
its the edge the shell
how come theres nothing out there
you see an edge
we were not at the edge before
wheres the room that killed rennes
quentin throws the boot after worth but the boot does not him its being thrown out of the room
oh that was good
what difference does it make
were dead anyways
listen to what im saying
there was a room there before
we havent been moving in circles the rooms have
that explains the thunder the shaking
weve been shifting the whole time
its the only logical explanation
im such an idiot
what are you on to leaven
give me a minute
the numbers are markers point on a map right
and how do you map a point that keeps moving
a list of all the co ordinates the room passes through
like a map that that tells you where the room starts how many times it moves and where it moves to
the numbers tell you all that
i dont know
ive only been looking at one point on the map which is probably the startingposition
all i saw was how the cube looked like before it started to move
ok so its moving
how do we get out
i know where the exit is
stay away from me
back off quentin
i just wanna know dont you wanna know
you remember that room we passed through before the one with the co ordinate larger than
what about it
that co ordinate placed the room outside the cube
right but only in its original position
what are you talking about
look the room starts off as a bridge then it moves its way through the maze which is where we ran into it but at some point it must return
to its original position
so the bridge is just a bridge
in a short period of time
this thing is like a giant combinationlock when the rooms are in their startingposition ht elock is open
but when they move out of the linement the lock closes
well the size of us
it must take days to complete a full cycle
so when does it open
now we see leaven doing some math again
quentin crawls towards her
we find its original co ordinates by adding the numbers the permutations is found by subtracting the numbers
the room moves to and on the x axis and on y and and on z
and what does that mean
you suck in math
ok i need the roomnumbers around as a referencepoint
did you get that
x is y is and z is
which means this room makes two more moves before returning to its original position
do we have time
then lets go
can you work out the traps in the system
fuck the traps lets get to the bridge
well you threw out our last boot you fucking idiot
technically i can identify the traps
first i thought they were identified by primenumbers but theyre not
theyre identified by a number that are the power of a prime
can you calculate that
the numbers are huge
but you can right
i have to calculate to numbers of factors in each set
maybe if i had a computer
you dont need a computer
yes i do
figure it out
yes i do
im not dying in a fucking ratmaze
no one in the whole world could do it mentally
look at the number
theres no way i can factor that
i cant even start on
what did you say
how many factors kazan
what are you fucking kidding
how many factors does have
i dont have any gumdrops
kazan ill give you a whole box of gumdrops for each answer
gumdrops come in bags
you want em in bags you got em in bags
i dont like the red ones
worth opens a door and tells the numbers to kazan
hes giving us the factors
youre telling me tell a son boy is a genius
by those numbers the room should be safe
theres only one way to find out
quentin takes worth and throws him into the room
kazan my man
quentin tries to make kazan give him the factors
whats the numbers boy
make him do it
kazan we gonna do some numbers ok
we like to do numbers right
can you tell me the factors of
come on lets go
you too worth
move your scuddy ass worth im not through with you yet
leaven open up that door and get einstein working on the numbers
as quentin has his head in the room worth closes the door and tries to choke quentin
come on kazan
you fuckheads youre dead
quentin gets his head out and worth closes the door
next we see the number
worth enters the room and closes the door
check the floor
is he dead
not even close worth
when im finish ill throw you in a fucking trap on the way out of here
on the other side of the door we see quentin opening the door
where is he
i said come here riiight
quentin falls down in the room under the floor
we see worth hanging down there
afterwards leaven and kazan help worth up from there
now we see the number two
the next door they open lead them to the edge again
this time theres much more light out there
leaven puts her head outside the room and quickly takes it back
a room is passing by
when they open the door again theres a room there
i guess that proves out theory
we see two numbers xxx four two three
they enter the new room except kazan the room they just came from moves away
in the background we hear kazan screaming
he hasnt moved far
im gonna find him
what do you think
you dont have a lot of lives left
we see kazan in a red room
then we see worth entering a blue room then we see leaven step on a piece of glass the one from her glasses
then we see worth in the ceiling of the red room with kazan
i didnt move
erm you have to climb up here ok
i dont like that
leaven opens a door and studies the numbers
five bags of gumdrops
come here worth this rooms next move takes it to the bridge
we dont have much time come on
worth and kazan crawls in to leavens room
leaven closes the door
they just make it before the room moves
as we see the group again they lie down
eaoh it better be it
it should be
leaven opens a door theres nothing behind it
she closes it again
give me a minute
so guess what this was the room we started in
i was right we should never have moved in the first place
the room starts to shake its moving
as it stops leaven opens the door
we see a red room
they enter the red room
leaven closes the door
kazan opens a new door
we see daylight
worth sits down
what are you doing
you cant quit now
its not your fault
i have nothing to live for out there
was is out there
boundless human stupidity
in the background we hear a door opening
i can live with that
leaven says some strange sounds she rises
behind her we see quentin with a door handle
quentin has stabbed leaven in the back
he drops her to the floor
hes covered with blood
kazan closes the door to the daily life
worth hits quentin quite hard
but just after quentin does the same to worth
kazan get out to the door
quentin stabs worth with the handle
worth falls to the ground
quentin tries to reach kazan
kazan opens the door
meanwhile the room starts to move
as kazan is outside the room quentin grabs his t shirt
as he is just halfway out he cant move anymore
worth holds quentins leg
quentin gets split up in two parts
afterwards we see the room move
theres blood on the inner cube
in the room again we see worth crawl towards leaven
halfway he stops moving he dies
the last we see of the movie is kazan looking at the inner cube before he turns around and disappears into the bright white light
