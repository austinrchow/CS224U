b if window
href b b an original screenplay by richard outten revised by david s
goyer based upon characters created by stephen king revised a storm is raging outside
we hear the clap and roll of thunder
rats scurry away down the scum covered steps as the glow of a lantern and footsteps herald someones arrival
emerges around the bend
her dress and face are smeared with grime and
is that blood we see too
god only knows whats happened to her
genvieve ducks under a monstrous cobweb as she passes an open window
lightning streaks across the night sky outside
we catch a glimpse of the moon disappearing behind the clouds
genvieve reaches the bottom of the stairs
the tomb itself
water trickles in through cracks in the lichen covered walls pooling on the tomb floor
genvieve moves forward her lantern throwing distorted shadows over everything
in front of her is anton lemarches stone sarcophagus
genvieve kneels in the water one hand resting on the spiked iron railing which surrounds the tomb
she reaches the other hand towards a scum covered plaque brushing the grime away
thunder and lightning reach a crescendo as
a skeletal hand rises out of the water reaching for her
the lantern falls from her grasp sputtering out
the hand reaches for her arm and inadvertently clutches her breast instead
genvieve starts to laugh hysterically
thank you renee
can we throw some light on the set
suddenly it is lighter
genvieve cant stop laughing
the groping monster hand disappears back beneath the water
the lemarche castle tomb is in fact a s movie set
we are inside a soundstage on a raised set so the slugline should really read
a film crew scurries about
everyone is laughing now
the director sits to the right
he and the dp are already huddled over the video assist monitor
we see the previous scene rewinding at high speed
the first a
water in the pools running low fill her up
crewmembers move towards the set
an sfx puppeteer i
the skeletal arm crawls out from under followed by an electrician
i cant see shit down there
im working blind
rises out of the water
her name is actually renee hallow and her beauty is undeniable even in such a disheveled state
this is great i couldve spent four months on a romantic comedy with warren beatty and instead ive got a horny zombie trying to cop a feel
the crew members laugh
shes well liked on the set
wardrobe and make up personnel move in to adjust renees appearance
uhgh theres water everywhere
beat can i get a cigarette
the make up girl pulls a pack of cigarettes from her fanny pack and offers renee one
in a flash a p
appears with a lighter
renee mumbles thanks as she fires up
she squints her eyes trying to see past the set lights
calling out geoff
beat anybody see my boy
right here mom
geoff matthews renees year old son steps into view
renees face lights up when she sees him
how long have you been here
i saw the last shot
that was pretty cool
renee grimaces as the make up girl spritzes her face with a spray bottle
casually how did it go with your father last night
he said hed be over for dinner at eight
awkward i mean
he misses you mom
i miss him too
continuing i just dont want you to get your hopes up okay
were trying to work things out but
her voice trails off
i know mom
affectionate you know everything dont you
renee and geoff are interrupted by a crewmember whos spraying atmosphere about the set with a hand held smoke machine
off set the first a
is trying to get the show on the road
were going to try this another time
guess its showtime
renee kisses geoff on the forehead
he takes the cigarette from her and moves off the set standing near the camera
the director turns back toward renee
we nail this and you wont have to do this ever again
thats what you said the first time
renee turns and heads back toward the stairs
hands her a new lantern
as she reaches the stairs the house lights dim creating the proper atmosphere once again
the puppeteer gets ready
the electrician checks a power box connection
the director nods to the camera operator
castle of terror
the slate comes down
the scene replays itself as before only now were watching the action from multiple viewpoints
we start on the video assist monitor then move up to
he grins as he watches the scene unfold
renee has reached the sarcophagus
the skeleton hand bursts up grabbing renees arm
the scene continues past the original point of interruption
we see an undetected leak
water drips down
the puppeteer shifts position struggling and
knocks over the power box which sparks just as
renee genvieve grabs the iron railing with both hands
electricity surges through renee
her body jerks and writhes like some nightmarish marionette
the electrician drags the puppeteer back
weve crossed over into
shut down the generator
crewmembers scream and scramble back
all the circuits are blowing lights exploding and showering sparks over the whole set
this is not part of the movie
she shakes her smoking hands frozen to the iron railing by the electricity running through her
suddenly renee falls forward against the iron
her face begins to the lights continue to blow casting a strobic effect over the soundstage adding to the chaos
as he witnesses the whole event
he tries to rush forward but someone restrains him
suddenly all the circuits in the stage are blown and the lights go out
renee slumps back into the water smoke trailing up from her still form
an aged golden retriever is on the surgical table
chase matthews d
gently strokes the dogs fur
hes good with the dog
the retrievers owners a mother and her son look on
i think this is probably for the best
hes a very old dog
he has arthritis
he has cataracts in his eyes
chase looks at the mother
hes always hated this part
hes had a good life
to dog havent you boy
doctor matthews your son is on line one
he says its an emergency
chase breaks concentration pulling his eyes away from the mother and son
a blur of activity converges on the movie set
a trio of paramedics
a fire official
a police officer
horrified crewmembers watch on helpless
we stay on geoff momentarily blocked out and then revealed again and again amidst the commotion of paramedics scrambling to save renee
the director has his hand on geoffs shoulder
geoffs eyes dart about taking it all in
things are happening very fast renees hand is lifted
someone checking her pulse
her eyelids parted
a pen light flashing at her fixed pupils
run me down a line of normal saline
needle plunges into the inside of renees elbow
a syringe injects into the i
hands hook up a life pack monitor
renees dress is torn away
electrodes press to bare skin
the monitor screen blinks to life
we have a bradycardic rhythm at
another paramedic dials out on a cellular phone to the consulting physician
approximately thirty five years old
a clear tube is inserted down her throat
the monitor shows erratic heartbeat
shes in v fib
theres a renewed urgency even amidst their rush
defibrillator paddles are pressed to her chest
geoff looks to the monitor as
it goes to flatline
geoff moves forward pulling away from the director
the police officer moves in and intercepts geoff turning the boy away
geoffs eyes fix on the monitor
an unbending flatline
you have to bring her back
chase rushes onto the set pushing past crewmembers
he freezes at the sight of the horrific commotion around renees still form
chases gaze connects with his son
we pull back from geoff chase and the commotion around renee
farther and farther as the darkness around the set begins to close in
urgent were losing her
darkness everywhere and we a form drifts forward materializing out of the fog
its a casket
appearing as if its floating among the clouds
pulling back we see that its moving along a conveyor
and now we can make out the faint form of a plane as the conveyor descends from the cargo compartment
the casket reaches the end of the conveyor
a tag marks its final destination bangor maine
hands reach in and lift the casket
four baggage handlers hoist the casket up onto their shoulders and carry it off
is it true she grew up around here
over in ludlow
never met a movie star before
well youre a little late for an autograph
the baggage handlers laugh as they walk off into the distance
the fog closes around them and we
we drift down from the gray sky to the somber scene below
off in the distance a crowd of mourners are gathered around a grave
i am the resurrection and the life saith the lord
the headstone is adorned with an iron plaque
it reads simply she that believeth in me though she were dead yet shall she live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die
the casket is slowly lowered into the open grave
as it descends we see geoff and his father chase standing at the forefront of the crowd
renees grave is next to those of her parents
among the mourners is marjorie hargrove an attractive local girl in her early twenties
further down the hillside a wall of news reporters are gathered behind a roped off media boundary
there is a blinding flurry of photo flashes as the press records the scene before them
a sheriffs department patrol car cruises up the cemetery drive pulling to a stop near the mob of reporters
out of the car steps gus gilbert
gus is nearly forty with a sheriffs uniform fitted to his solid ageless frame
gruff maybe a little self important gus likes being a big fish in a small pond
drawing near lets keep it back folks
try to show her a little respect
a reporter ducks under the media boundary moving in for a closer shot
he doesnt make it two steps before hes intercepted by gus
gus grabs the reporter and shoves him back
what did i just say
gus means business
one look into his eyes reveals his intense no nonsense approach
the reporter backs off
beneath the gloomy ominous skies the lines on chases face shade him as a decade older than his thirty five years
chase gently places a comforting hand on geoffs shoulder
geoff inches forward pulling free of chases touch
drawn to his mother drawn from his father
the only blemishes on his youthful rosy cheeks are the tears the endless tears
i know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth
geoff looks upon the casket gazing into the abyss of despair
the crowd has dispersed
geoff is standing at the base of renees grave
his eyes fixed
chase is nearby watching not wanting to intrude on geoffs private moment
gus quietly moves in at chases side
did she always have reporters following her around like this
pretty much so
gus glances at geoff
i hear you moved into town
i wanted to get geoff out of l
just start things over you know
now his eyes fall on renees headstone
i remember when renee left
she couldnt wait to get out of ludlow
she used to say that life moved too slow here
chase forces a smile
thats renee alright
i suppose so
the sky above seems heavy with imminent rain and we
lazy oaks embrace a vintage two story victorian home in the rural neighborhood of ludlow maine
a commercial moving van is parked out front
marjorie the girl we saw at renees funeral is coming down the sidewalk
she checks the address on the front of the house then heads up the driveway
moving boxes clutter the downstairs
chase is weaving through the maze doing an inventory on the boxes
a sweaty pair of movers are climbing up the stairs
each is hunched over with a garment box balanced on his back
the side of each carton is boldly labeled renee attic
weve got six more of these
you sure you want them all in the attic
chase is contemplating a compromise when geoff appears from the kitchen doorway
geoff what if we just give the clothes to goodwill
well keep the rest
just the clothes
geoff shakes his head firm and deliberate denial
youre the one who wanted to move
nobody wouldve touched them if you didnt want to move here
chase weakens giving in
all the renee boxes go in the attic
marjorie knocks on the open frame of the front door
geoff recognizes her from his mothers funeral
she flashes him a warm smile
im marjorie hargrove
your new housekeeper
marjorie has a naive friendly quality about her
shes also blessed with eye popping genetics
standing there outside the door looking more than a little nervous
we cant help but like her
needless to say she doesnt look like your typical housekeeper
re chases reaction is something wrong
look different than you sounded on the phone
please come in
she grins at geoff again
shes nervous alright
im real excited about working for you mr
well were glad to have you marjorie
you can call me chase by the way
marjorie passes her curious eyes over one of renees garment containers
ive always admired ms
that scene she did in blue midnight where her lover meets her at the train station
she sighs i mustve watched that movie four times
marjories enthusiasm is endearing
just then one of the movers loses his grip
a garment box bounces down the slope of the stairs
when it reaches the bottom dresses spill over the floor
ill get that
marjorie moves for the spill
the first dress she touches is a beaded peach evening gown
her fingers linger on the fabric
this is gorgeous
she wore this at the emmys didnt she
geoff moves forward acting overly defensive
hey dont touch her stuff
it made her crazy when people touched her stuff
marjorie is taken aback by the oddity of geoffs statement
chase catches her eye shrugging apologetically
a van is parked outside
the rear side panel is masked off with tape and a stencil
chase grabs the corner of the tape and carefully peels it back revealing a crisp new business logo serving aroostook county establishing
shops and businesses situated around a lazy town square
as rural as they come
we pick up chases van as it cruises by
chase pulls the van in front of an unassuming veterinary office
on the door is chases nameplate
and on the weathered wall is an outline of letters where the name and title quentin yolander doctor of veterinary medicine once was
geoff is first out of the van
geoff and chase move inside
the offices look like they were built in the s
a dark corridor stretches down the center of the suite
faded green walls are solid with few exteriors
its creepy in here
heavy grey plastic curtains absorb much of the light which does find its way in
nothing looks like its been updated in the past fifty years
this doesnt look so bad
chase sweeps a curtain aside revealing the interior to geoff
dust swirls in the air
how long ago did this guy retire
its been a few years
geoff takes a look around growing uncomfortable
skeptical a few
geoff moves on down the central corridor which seems to grow darker and more dismal with every step
he moves on into the boarding room
rows of kennels are stacked along the walls smothered with cobwebs
ancient rusted surgical equipment is scattered everywhere
the place is a mess
windows are boarded up and shadows cloak the room
over to the right geoff hears a rustling
a cardboard box on one of the shelves jiggles
something is moving around inside it
geoffs eyes widen
still morbid curiosity propels him forward
the box rustles again
he reaches for it and
a creature leaps out at him howling
geoff screams and jumps back
the box tumbles over and
a cat crawls out
behind the protective mother are four of the cutest kittens weve ever seen mewing away
geoff sighs just as chase rushes into the room
i just got spooked by a bunch of furballs
inside the box is a note
chase reaches for it
it reads and a warm welcome to you
great now ive opened an orphanage too
one of the kittens pads out of the box and looks up at geoff with sleepy eyes
her fur is striped
well ill take one
if its okay
geoff lifts the fragile creature cradling it in his arms
she looks like a tiger
chase spies an old broom resting in the corner
tell you what you do some sweeping up here and shes yours
geoff nods and chase moves back out into the hallway
geoff sets the box back upright and lowers tiger in with the other kittens
he reaches for the broom and goes to work sweeping away the cobwebs
just as soon as he turns his back tiger climbs the side of the box spilling over onto the floor
chase is unpacking a shipment of medical supplies
when he places them in the cabinet he stirs up a layer of dust
tiger scampers by as chase coughs his way out of the cloud of dust
tiger sees the front door ajar
and as she approaches to explore what lies beyond the door swings open
zowie a siberian husky is staring back at her
hes black and white with blue eyes with a mask that is at once menacing and majestic
a pudgy thirteen year old boy drew has a hold of the dogs collar
zowies bark sends tiger scrambling
drew loses his grip as zowie yanks free
a strong paternal command calls after drew from outside
drew you get a handle on that dog now
chase spins around at the commotion as tiger darts across the floor with the barking dog in pursuit
mayhem ensues as zowies big paws slip on the slick tile
geoff rushes in from the boarding area
tiger ducks beneath the back of a surgical gurney
zowies snoot wedges beneath the base inches from tigers tiny striking paw
drew slides in on his knees renewing his hold on zowies collar
he pulls the dog back
geoff rescues tiger from beneath the gurney
drew shrugs sheepishly
he gets kinda hyper
drews stepfather gus gilbert enters
the dreaded domineering voice of authority in drews life
we know him as the sheriff at renees funeral
hell he thought it was lunch
how ya doin chase
a handshake you havent met my boy
aside drew where the hell are your manners
drew steps forward and awkwardly offers his hand to chase
the boys shake
hes a cool lookin dog
zowie lurches forward eager to shower affection on geoff
geoff strokes the dogs soft mane
whats his name
drew puts his palm under zowies chin and turns him for chase to see
there are several scabbed over gashes on his left cheek
damn dog stuck his nose in on my rabbits and they ganged up on him
i swear that dogs an idiot
is he gonna be okay
with one eye on zowie chase sprays some antiseptic on the examination table and wipes it clean
lets have him hop up here
drew prods zowie
zowie jumps up onto the table
chase looks over the facial lacerations then turns on a penlight and examines the dogs eyes
gus passes a lingering look over tiger
he reaches in to pet her making sure it meets with geoffs approval
when i was young i thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys
there are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes
drew perks up at the thought but gus shoots it down
not our home
chase takes the light out of zowies eyes
he looks to gus
thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly
ill give you som antibiotic cream drew hes your dog
are you listening to this
chase turns to drew and continues
his left eye is scratched corneal abrasion
eyedrops will help but its going to take som time
try to keep him away from those rabbits huh
drew nods casting a glance aside at gus
to chase i hear youve got marjorie hargrove working for you now
howd you know that
gus gives chase a knowing grin
its a small town chase
gus laughs and claps chase on the shoulder
hey geoff did you know your mother and i used to be high school sweethearts
geoff is surprised at this
surprised and annoyed
tact isnt a quality that gus possesses in abundance
whole nine yards
to chase course that was a lifetime ago
junior high school kids are converging en masse for classes
chases van pulls up front
chase digs some cash out of his wallet
geoff stares out at the school
hes dreading this
whats a lunch cost these days
you want ten
chase looks at his son
new town new school
i know it must be pretty hard for you
cutting him off ill be fine dad
geoff reaches for the door but chase stops him
hes trying to reach his son
he really is
you have to help me out here a little
chase drops his eyes to the bulge squirming around in geoffs jacket
he cant help but smile
are you sure you dont want me to pick you up
its a long ride
geoff opens the side panel of the van and slips out his mountain thats what my bikes for
before chase can say another word geoff is gone
as chase pulls away we see the handmade sign taped in the back window drew is among a small circle of boys
he recognizes geoff walking his bike from the van
the largest of the boys clyde takes notice of the unfamiliar face
clyde is fifteen going on twenty
you know the type local bully held back a year or two
check it out
thats the new kid
the son of that movie star
mischief gleams in clydes eyes as he watches geoffs every move
the other boys follow suit
clyde always takes the lead
geoff fields their penetrating stares
for a second his eyes connect with clydes then he moves on into the building
among the boys drew is the reluctant participant
gordon is addressing a room of seventh graders
geoff is doodling in his notebook feeling acutely out of place as he tries to avoid the curious glances the rest of his new classmates are giving him
people this is geoff matthews
hell be joining our class for the rest of the school year
gordon points to him geoff drops his face even lower
this is the worst embarrassment a boy could ever suffer
hed like to throttle mrs
a freckle faced boy doug fires off a question
hey whats hollywood like
do you know eddie murphy
why dont we save that for later doug
a girl with braces susan continues the interrogation
what about julia roberts
thatll be enough
susan shuts up
geoff sinks even lower in his seat
the kids turn their eyes back to the front of the room
but one classmates eyes are still on geoff
clyde shifts his stare to the squirming lump in geoffs jacket
he catches a glimpse of tigers bobbing nose popping out
geoff joins the stampede of kids as the bell releases them for the day
almost immediately clyde and his cronies stevie and brad fall in step behind him
drew hangs slightly off to the side not really wanting to be a part of the intimidation
whats the hurry junior
where you off to
clyde quickens his pace pulling ahead of geoff and stopping in front of him
stevie and brad move in on either side
surrounded by peers its apparent how small geoff is for his age
on the wall next to them is a bulletin board display
clyde glances at it
geoff follows his gaze
its one of those corny school affairs with construction paper letters spelling out we remember renee hallow
beneath that are pictures of renee clipped from various magazines
feigning remorse too bad about your mom
papers said it was pretty gross getting fried like that
guess you saw it huh
clyde raises his eyebrows pulling geoffs jacket open
so what are you hiding there
when you bring a friend to school youre supposed to introduce him
geoffs arm tightens protectively around tiger
her names tiger
dont you think thats kind of a pussy name
reaching out can i hold her
i promise ill be real careful
clyde has a convincing way about him
geoff reluctantly hands the kitten over
clyde is so gentle with the creature that one would never question his sincerity
geoff is just beginning to feel at ease when something changes in clydes tone something sinister
you ever seen a kitten run
ive seen her run around the house
clydes eyes narrow
he takes a couple of steps back
geoffs heart starts to sink
no i mean really run
beat like this
clyde backsteps and bolts off down the hallway with tiger
brad and stevie fall in behind him laughing
drew shrugs apologetically
hes torn but he tears off after them nonetheless
geoff runs off in pursuit of them
geoff rushes from the building searching the dispersing crowd
there they are tearing from the bike racks pedaling for the street
clyde sees geoff and mockingly holds the kitten out for display as they ride by
geoff runs for the bike racks
clyde and his cohorts break from the outskirts of town riding out onto the open road
clyde glances back toward the center of town
geoff is so far behind hes barely visible
clyde returns his eyes to the road ahead raising tiger nose to nose with him
having fun yet
clyde and his smirking buddies ride on out of frame
giving the pedals all he can struggling to keep pace with the boys
scattered houses sprinkle the landscape ahead
cochran lake stretches into the distance beyond the housing
clydes clan cuts from the road and blazes a trail across a residential property
the two story house is weathered and boarded up
it looks vaguely familiar
and when we find the mailbox post we know why
the name is faded but theres no question who once lived there
five bold letters geoff whips by in a blur still in pursuit
clyde and his friends have abandoned their bikes
theyve taken position on top of the slope of the hill standing at the foot of geoff pulls his bike to a stop short of the boys
he dismounts and leans it up against a tree
just give me the cat all right
a devilish grin creeps over clyde
he strolls down the path toward geoff
clyde grabs geoffs handlebars and backing up pulls geoff and the bike with him
i would but
there was a little accident
feeding off geoffs alarm she was trying to get away
you know running down my leg
and her head got too close to the spokes
whats left of her is up in the pet sematary
a zip lock bag might help
shrugs but i happen to be out of them at the moment
drew shakes his head disgusted he has to put up with clydes antics
come on clyde just tell him where the cat is
turning on drew i told him where the cat is
now shut up fuck face
clyde punches drew in the arm
drew shrinks back
geoff flashes a hateful stare at clyde
all of the boys but clyde are uncomfortably silent
theres something frightening about clyde
something that extends beyond the standard bully antics
we begin to get the feeling that this kid is genuinely deranged
relishing the moment you heard about the creed murders yet
and the place where the dead come back to life
he motions to the path behind him
continuing its just back there
just down that path
its not funny anymore
so you got a problem
whatre you gonna do fat ass
you gonna sic big bad old gus after me
drew shuts up
clyde turns back to geoff drawing closer
what do you think geoff
maybe you could dig up your mom and take her back there
maybe if you pray real hard shell come back
with this last remark clyde has pushed too far
geoffs face is red with anger
quietly just give me the cat ass hole
clydes grin falters a moment
excuse me maybe im a little hard of hearing
but did you just call me an ass hole
clyde pokes geoff in the shoulder
you mad geoff
cause if you are you should take a shot at me
this time clyde shoves geoff back even harder
come on you pussy
whats the matter with you
clyde moves forward again and geoff suddenly lashes out catching everyone off guard
for an instant drew marvels at geoffs tenacity
he hammers geoff with blows
outsizing him by forty pounds clyde tosses geoff to the ground
geoff struggles but clydes grip proves arresting
clyde throws geoff onto his stomach forcing his face into the dirt
it looks as if hes ready to smother his opponent
drew is the first to rush in
brad and stevie quickly follow
it takes all three of them to peel clyde off geoff
clyde gets to his feet and backs away
theres great pleasure in his crazed eyes as he watches geoff coughing and gasping
fuckin ass hole
satisfied hes handed out enough ill will for the day clyde turns away
drews attentions remain on geoff
as clyde strolls by he grabs drews arm and swings him around
this way fat boy
stevie and brad follow
as the group passes geoffs bike clyde gives it a kick knocking it over
then theyre gone
geoff pulls himself to his feet
brushing off the mess he heads up the path in search of tiger
the woods here have grown long with shadows
the air is still and the sound of birds is conspicuously absent
a wooden archway frames the entrance to the primitive graveyard
scrawled across the weatherstained boards is a childs barely legible attempt at pet sematary
geoff trepidatiously enters the clearing of crude crowded graves
collars leashes bird cages and other accessories adorn the makeshift crosses and headstones
geoff moves along the outer circle of markers each crafted by a childs caring hands
as he searches he cant help but notice the heartfelt epitaphs
on the outer circle he sees a crate board marker memorializing moving inward the markers are older
the ones he can still read convey a sense of the perpetual cycle of life and death
here is a wide flat upright board planted deep in the earth in memory of marta our pet rabit dyed march
the next three rows are illegible the inscriptions are weathered beyond recognition
and then chiseled into sandstone hannah and now
but very much alive
geoff picks up his pace weaving quickly toward the center
there he finds tiger
trapped in a rusted old birdcage its base swallowed by the grave
geoff opens the door and frees tiger stroking the trembling kitten
geoffs eyes are drawn to the far perimeter
to the deadfall
the deadfall looms on the outskirts of the clearing like a pile of skeletal remains
an abstract stairway to things beyond
a wind picks up just then sending leaves skittering in waves across the ground
when geoff turns around he finds drew waiting for him under the archway
drew smiles full of respect for geoff
ive never seen anybody punch clyde before
shrugs he pissed me off
his smile fading sorry about your mom
beat i couldnt handle not having my mom around
just having gus
he grimaces at the thought
my dads not so bad
drew glances around at all the makeshift grave markers
i swear sometimes i wish gus was dead
serious you shouldnt ever say that about your parents not even your dad
gus is my stepdad
geoff nods knowingly
what was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life
its just an old ghost story
lets get out of here
they head off full of childhood
marjorie is at the stove fixing up dinner while chase scans the newspaper at the table
geoff enters through the kitchen door
he moves past them without a word
calling after him hey
how was your first day at school
over his shoulder it sucked
now is that any way to talk to your father
geoff stops for a moment turns
youre not my mother
and exits through the opposite door
chase looks to marjorie and offers a sympathetic shrug
crude cages house dozens of rabbits
situated alongside the garage
a sign above the cages reads pet rabbits
bells positioned along the roof threaten to reveal foul play
gus is rigging a wire along the base of the cage
finishing it off he hangs the plug next to an outside socket
moving onto the next chore he pours pressed alfalfa pellets into feeding slots for the hungry rabbits
setting the feed aside he takes a seat
opening one of the cages he grabs a rabbit and sets it on his lap gently petting its soft fur
one of the cages starts to vibrate
gus gives it a look a pair of rabbits arent interested in eating theyre joined in fast and furious passion
gus gets a chuckle out of the sight
way to go romeo
gus replaces the rabbit in the hutch
and before he goes he sinks the plug into the socket
an electrical charge dances along the base of the cage a deterrent for intruders
drews mother amanda withdraws a roast from the oven
gus is at the sink washing his hands
he turns to see zowie laying at drews feet in the living room
drew is watching a music video on tv
drew i dont remember inviting zowie in for dinner
just until he heals up
gus is waggling his thumb toward the back door
drew slumps in defeat
gus reaches into the cabinet and pours himself a bourbon
drew walks zowie from the house with a dish of dog food
as they pass the rabbit dens zowie alters his path
drew gets a handful of his collar and pulls him back
across the yard is an enclosed dog run
twenty feet long by ten feet wide
drew puts zowie inside with the dog food
drew strokes zowies mane affectionately then backs away closing the wood framed door to the dog run
amandas about to put the roast on the table when gus nuzzles up behind her breathing down her backside
with his drink in hand he sweeps her hair aside and zeros in for a kiss on the back of the neck
gus eases his free hand around between amanda and the counter and presses his palm firmly into her crotch drawing her body tight to him
she stiffens at his intimate hold uncomfortable with his timing
at the back door drew is watching from beyond the screen disgusted by the sight of gus pawing his mother
drew swings the door open as loud as he can to signal his return
gus plants a last kiss on the back of amandas neck and backs off
but before he goes he snatches a chunk of meat from the serving platter
leveling his leering eyes at amanda he stuffs it into his mouth suggestively
god damn youre good
drew rolls his eyes and takes his seat at the table returning his attention to the tv where another music video is on
gus glances at the tv annoyed by the music
he drops into his spot at the head of the table blocking drews view
drew leans to the side for a better look
gus takes notice and leans to the same side to obstruct his view
youre breaking the law here drew
it wont bother me
gus ignores her inching forward with a confidential harsh whisper
your moms spent the last hour cooking
stop being a little jerk and show her some appreciation
drew aims the remote control at gus as if to shut him up and silences the tv
amanda approaches with the roast
the moment its on the table drew starts dishing up a hefty serving
gus spears drews fork with the serving fork
not that much appreciation
i thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass
hey im so sorry im not the stud that you are
knock it off guys
gus throws back a sip of bourbon
to drew quietly you watch that mouth of yours drew buddy
moving through zowies enclosed pen we see no sign of the dog
reaching the door we find that the wood around the bottom hinge has been chewed through
the base of the door is ajar just enough for a dog to have slipped through
in the still of the night gus rabbit pens sit unattended
and then we hear the tinkling of dog tags
snoozing rabbits awaken as zowie lumbers into frame
zowie rises on his hind legs pressing his paws to a cage
blue sparks fly as zowie is jolted with the electrical charge
the electrical zing
the dogs whimpering cry
and the ringing of bells reach gus in rapid succession rousting him from his sleep
he rolls out of bed and grabs his robe
damn it drew
that dog is history
amanda stirs groggily focusing on gus departing figure
drew swings open the door to the hallway as gus marches by stuffing shells into a shotgun
panicked drew takes off after him
zowie swings his head in the direction of the house as gus bursts through the back door
drew is one step behind
gus swings the gun up and fires off a shot
zowie bolts for the shadows of the hillside
drew rushes in and deflects the aim of the rifle
dont shoot him
gus eyes are wild with anger
what did you say
gus throws drew aside brings the rifle back up and fires another random shot after the fleeing dog
all the while his eyes remain on drew as if this were the boys lesson to be learned
he squeezes off one more shot
a pained yelp echoes from the hillside
drew whips his head aside in sickened shock
even gus is sobered by the unexpected hit
all they can hear now are zowies whimpering cries diminishing in the night
drew shoots gus a look of such unbridled hatred that gus is speechless
he backs away from gus and darts off toward the dark hillside
when gus turns back for the house amanda is standing there
jesus gus what have you done
ah come on amanda stop looking at me like that
hes had ample warning about that dog
amanda glares at him an outpouring of pent up strain
gus defiantly marches past amanda entering the house without ever meeting eyes with her
drew pauses long enough to listen for zowie
nothing until a faint cry drifts back at him
zowie limps into frame
blood is flowing from the bullet wound in his left hindquarter trailing from his suspended leg
every step is a strain
comes upon a break in the trees
the hanging moon outlines the knoll stretching beyond
and then the strained breathing the hushed whimper
drew hesitantly approaches the crest of the knoll
zowie is just beyond lying on his side at the end of the bloody trail
his chest rises and falls almost imperceptibly with every effort to survive
drew drops to his knees at zowies side and cradles the dog in his lap shaking his head in denial
zowies weak eyes shift gazing longingly at drew
drew strokes the fur under zowies chin hardly able to see the dog through his glaze of tears
zowies eyes drift off
his chest falls and doesnt rise again
he falls limp in drews arms
drew hugs zowie even tighter and he begins to weep
we see the image of drew with the dog cradled in his arms silhouetted against the moonlit horizon
geoff appears from the garage with his bike and takes off for the road
a whistle catches his ear
drew is at the edge of the woods beckoning for geoff
geoff circles around and doubles back
i was just going by your house
wheres your bike
the closer geoff gets the more he sees of drews despair
then he sees the dried blood staining drews clothes
geoffs heart sinks
an unspoken moment of sympathy passes between the boys
fighting the emotions drew finally speaks
i have to bury him
i dont want to go out there alone
theres such grief in drews words that geoff cant resist
he glances toward his house to make sure he hasnt been seen then blends into the woods
drew carries zowies relaxed form in his arms
geoff is following balancing a pickaxe and shovel
arriving at the graveyard geoff searches the outer perimeter for a vacant stretch of soil
finding one he lets the heavy tools fall to the ground
is this a good spot
im not burying him here
theres a better place
drew heads for the base of the deadfall with zowie in his arms
its back here somewhere through the indian woods
i know we can find it
drew continues up the deadfall disappearing over the crest
geoff gathers up the shovel and pickaxe and follows after him
hey wait up
geoff climbs over the peak of the deadfall
beyond is a dark swamp a bog looking unlike anything one would expect in maine
tendrils of ground fog swirl about vegetation that looks almost prehistoric
gnarled trees rise up from the murky earth blocking the sun from view
geoff hurries down the other side of the deadfall to catch up with drew
somewhere off in the distance we hear an unearthly sound
not a bird
not any animal known to man
spectral shapes flicker at the edge of geoffs vision sinking back into the shadows as geoff tries to focus on them
uneasy drew where are we going
drew doesnt respond
he continues on without another word hell bent on finding this better place
at the boundary of the bog a stairway of huge wide stones rises from the blanket of ground fog
bordered by fir trees
leading up the hillside
the final leg of drew and geoffs journey
this is it
i wasnt sure if it even really existed
the old indian burial ground
geoffs eyes move to the stairway of stones
come on thats just a bullshit story
you said so yourself
what if its not bullshit
if i bury zowie there and it works
beat hell come back alive
drew i know your dog died but
get a grip man youre freaking me out
look if there was even one chance in a million itd work wouldnt you want to try
geoff feels for drew
its pointless to reason
drew starts up the stone steps
geoff has no choice but to follow
even in broad daylight the flat topped mesa has a sense of foreboding isolation
theres an almost palpable sense of wrongness about this place
as if the darkness of a dying black hole was seeping out of the ground and spreading across the earth
drew and geoff approach the circle of rocky soil
they stand at the border looking it over in eerie silence
somewhere off in the distance we hear the unearthly sound again only this time its closer
look lets just get this over with
even drew seems to have awakened from the haze he had fallen into
he gently sets zowies body on the ground
if this doesnt work
dont ever tell anyone i did this okay
you gotta promise
geoff nods and hands over the digging tools
drew swings the pickaxe sinking it into the ground
you want me to help
you have to bury your own
thats the way the indians did it
its like a rule
backing away from the burial ground geoff takes a seat on a rock at the border of the forest
from there he watches
drew alternates the pickaxe and shovel as he clears a hole in the rocky ground
we move in on geoff whos looking on with skeptical intrigue as the rhythmic sound of the tools continues
a cairn is complete a conical pile of rocks over zowies grave
drew is now sitting on the rock next to geoff
together they stare at the cairn as if zowie might climb from beneath at any moment
what if he really does come back
geoff shrugs pondering such a thought
geoff digs into his pocket and produces a pack of gum offering one to drew
with only a quick glance away from the grave drew snatches a piece and he stuffs it into his mouth
geoff does the same
they sit together in silence
nervously chewing their gum
watching the grave
ive never had anyone die before
beat but i guess you get over it
i mean eventually
quietly you never get over it
the sun dips over the horizon giving way to dusk
geoffs eyes shift from the grave to the darkening sky
its getting pretty late
we better go
they rise leaving the burial ground
en route drew pauses for a last look at the grave
so long zowie
geoff follows glancing back at the burial ground
it looks magical in the twilight not quite so sinister now
drew is walking home along the road alone
headlights blind him as a car approaches
it slows and pulls a u turn stopping at drews side
its gus squad car
he pushes open the passenger door
drew takes a step back shaking his head
your mommas worried sick over you
you take off in the middle of the night you dont show up for school
whatre you trying to prove
im not trying to prove anything
beat i was burying my dog
gus turns his eyes away focusing on the dark road ahead
life is full of lessons
no ones above it
now get in the car
after a moment drew approaches the car
without another word gus drives off
its quiet now
and out of the silence comes the jingling of zowies dog tags
zowies long shadow creeps over the cage distorted to monstrous proportion by the flickering light
we move past the cages to the back porch
we see zowies paw scratching at the door
amanda wakens with a start
she rises eyes focusing on the dark bedroom
gus is sound asleep next to her
then from outside we faintly hear zowies scratching
slowly amanda rises from bed pulling on a bathrobe as she heads for the door
amanda appears at the door
she unlatches it stepping outside
amanda looks down and screams
photos of drew with zowie are tacked on the wall above the bed
the one photo of drew amanda and gus has been altered with a cut out head of zowies pasted on gus shoulders
we find drew below
hes fallen asleep with his walkman on
even with his ears covered the pounding at the door jolts him awake
half asleep drew peels off the headphones
drew you unlock this door
unlock it drew
the anger in his mothers voice brings him off the bed
gus pounding continues
drew moves to the door
the inside is secured by a double dead bolt
instead of unlocking them he opens a tiny customized window which gives him a view of the hall
what did i do now
open the door drew
drew unlatches the deadbolts and steps back as gus bursts through the door
where do you come off lying like that
im burying my dog
you think a lie like thats never gonna catch up to you
drew backs into the bed taking a seat
amanda comes through the door and behind her is
this is our first glimpse of the resurrected dog
fur shiny and wet the gaping gunshot wound in his rear
zowies head hangs low his eyes gleaming red
the husky is covered with dirt from head to toe
drews eyes widen in astonishment
zowie staggers across the room towards drew nails clicking on the floorboards
drew shrinks back in uncertain horror as the dog moves closer
zowie absently throws his arms up onto the bed across drews lap
and slowly perfunctory his tongue licks drews cheek
this last action of zowie displaces drews fear
tears well up in the boys eyes
a whisper zowie
say your goodbyes
zowies going outside
youre grounded buddy
thats the new law
drew lifts his hand from stroking zowies fur
his palm is covered with muddy blood
i never knew an open wound could smell so bad
beat honey he should have been looked at this morning
i dont know what you were thinking
its a wonder hes still alive
drew gazes into the dogs vacant eyes
it truly is a wonder
chase enters and stops in the doorway
geoff sits in front of the television with a pile of videotapes next to him
hes scanning through renees old movies with the remote
the sound has been turned down and the effect is a little eerie
we see renee move through a scene
geoff hits the slo mo button and the image winds down
her eyes stare out at us from the alien universe of the past
geoff doesnt respond
hes captivated by renee
chase moves into the room
geoff pauses the tape
renee freezes the image flickering ever so slightly
for an instant we think we see a flash of renee being electrocuted
but its only an instant
finally geoff tears his eyes away from the screen resenting his fathers intrusion
geoffs face softens
do you think
beat you think you and mom wouldve gotten back together
chase draws closer
he takes a seat next to geoff
the pain in his sons eyes is almost more than he can stand
i think so
continuing your mom and i loved each other geoff
dont ever think that we didnt
i still cant believe shes dead
chase moves to reach for his son and suddenly the phone rings shattering the moment
chase hesitates but finally he rises and answers the phone
after a moment he returns
who was that
remember zowie drews dog
he got hurt again
im going over to take a look at him
geoffs eyes widen
he looks like a ghost walked over his grave
im going with you
chase nods and exits to get his coat
geoff looks back at the tv once more
the image paused
renee staring at us from beyond the grave
gus amanda drew and geoff are gathered around chases van
chase lays zowie on his side on an examining table and shines an overhead light onto the wound
geoff is looking in from outside utterly bewildered by the living breathing dog
howd it happen
gus casts a threatening glance in drews direction
glaring at gus some psycho hunter probably got trigger happy
chase is too busy preparing a syringe to notice the nonverbal exchange
im going to give zowie a local anaesthetic so i can clean up the wound
id like to take him home tonight for observation
can you keep him at your place until he gets better
drew tenderly strokes zowies mane as chase administers the injection
zowie stares up at geoff with dull blank eyes
drew reads geoffs bewilderment and joins him outside the van
their words are clear but whispered
maybe he wasnt dead when we buried him
he was dead
you know he was
geoff returns his stare to zowie
you cant tell anyone geoff
geoff looks into drews eyes and nods in understanding
tiger is curled up at the foot of geoffs bed
geoff climbs in careful not to disturb the kitten
as he lays his head back on the pillow
sleep tight darling
ill be with you soon
its a womans voice
a familiar one
now we hear the rhythmic creak of a rocking chair
and with it comes the voice again humming a haunting lullaby
wide eyed geoff turns his head toward the source
a womans nondescript form is seated in the rocking chair across the room
rocking forward her face passes into a swath of moonlight
with the rock of the chair her face recedes back into the shadows
her soothing hum remains
and again her face passes into the swath of light
and again it retreats
geoff raises his hand reaching out for her
renees hand rises from the shadows reaching for him
but suddenly the room begins to stretch
the rocking chair and the bed seem distanced like polar extremes mother and son hopelessly separated by forces beyond their control
lightning flashes in the bedside window
renee is falling farther and farther away
geoff leaps from his bed as the darkness closes in and
bolts up from his pillow
awake now face wet with perspiration
it was a nightmare
except if it was a nightmare why do we still hear
the steady creak of the rocking chair
geoff slowly turns his head once again repeating the actions of his dreams
in the shadows the chair is still rocking
as it comes forward into the moonlight we see zowie curled up asleep on the seat of the chair
tiger is not on the bed anymore
shes up on top of the bookcase now wide awake eyes fixed on the dog
geoff stares at the rocking chair petrified
chase strips off the bandage over zowies rear end
the wound is gooey and open
geoff reads the concern in chases expression
drew is right there at geoffs side looking on
whats the deal
i dont know
hes had three days
his immune system shouldve responded by now
chase puts on his stethoscope and checks under the dogs rib cage for a pulse
he checks a number of places then shakes his head totally confused
i cant seem to find a pulse
it must be so weak its not registering
geoff and drew share conspiratorial glances as chase sets the stethoscope aside and extracts a blood sample
chase labels the capped vial of blood zowie and carefully places it into a packing container
when he closes the lid we see the preaddressed label school of veterinary medicine lab samples enclosed uncomfortable with chases investigation geoff reaches for zowie
well take him back to the kennels dad
the kittens are hissing shrinking to the back of their kennel
zowie stands motionless before their cage gazing in at them
geoff and drew are nearby putting the finishing touches on the bedding inside a larger boarding kennel
you think my dadll figure out why hes not getting better
you think hed believe it if he did
one of the kittens spats fearfully at zowie
geoff turns to stare at zowie
how can he not have a heartbeat
worried maybe it takes a while
drew lifts zowie into the kennel
geoff secures the door something that clearly must be done from the outside
zowie immediately begins to pace back and forth inside the cage
he turns towards us and we
a snarling werewolf rushing at us
chase jumps back frightened out of his wits and we realize
the werewolf is part of a group of costumed kids out trick or treating
the kids laugh at chases reaction and hurry on dragging their candy loot bags behind them
chase sighs and turns to lock the office door
hes closing up for the night
he climbs into his mobile vet van
we hold on the new sign in the back window a halloween treat
beneath that is a pencil sketch of a black arched back kitten
marjorie and geoff are at the kitchen table with the remnants of dinner
geoff is doing last minute touches on his costume
marjorie looks over his costume
hes got a hockey mask pushed back onto the top of his head
so whore you going as wayne gretzky
for effect geoff slips the hockey mask down over his face before answering
im going as jason
whos he play for
he hacks people up
geoff checks his watch
as geoff heads for the door chase is just coming in for the evening
wherere you off to
im going out dad
geoff ducks out the door
chase turns to marjorie
hes probably going up to the pet sematary
kidsve been going out there on halloween night for years
what do they do up there
oh you know
drink beer tell ghost stories
they try and spook each other out talking about zombies and things
she shrugs its no big deal chase
i did it when i was young
drew is at the bathroom mirror
amanda puts the finishing touches of color on drews lips
shes done an alarmingly good job of turning drew into the joker
you make sure youre home by ten
if gus finds out i let you go
sighs ill be home mom
i wont let gus blow up again
amanda looks drew straight in the eyes
drew i know gus isnt your father but you never even knew your real father
he walked out on the both of us and you remember that
beat gus isnt that way
he has it in him to love us both
you just have to give him a chance
drew nods respectfully
amanda gives him a kiss
drawing back she rubs out the lipmarks shes left on his made up cheek
dark clouds paint the foreboding sky
a broken pulse of lightning streaks through the dense haze
abandoning their bikes next to the path drew and geoff approach the archway
the graveyard beyond is deathly silent
they pass beneath the archway entering the clearing
and now a soft chilling voice drifts over the graves
geoff freezes in his tracks awestruck as
swoops down from the darkness above materializing out of nowhere
a fluttering negligee
flowing blonde hair
renees face appears out of the shadows masked with sadness
geoff swallows the lump in his throat
renees form keeps coming
but even as she approaches her visage grows less distinguishable
just a phantom countenance now
a shadow framed by golden hair resting atop a veiled body
shes coming so fast that shes upon geoff in no time
he fumbles back startled out of his wits
the body is upon him now flailing wildly
geoff thrashes and struggles screaming bloody murder
gradually he realizes the body isnt fighting back
geoff eases his struggle lets his scream fall off
now he hears wild mischievous laughter
drew pulls the body away
its just a heavy wad of stuffed clothing a dummy dressed in a negligee capped by a blonde wig
it dangles near the end of a slanted wire
clyde stevie brad and a half dozen other costumed kids appear from the nearby cover of bushes doubled over in laughter
clyde tugs at a piece of twine thats connected to the back of the dummys head and makes spooky sounds
the dummy jumps around on the slanted wire
clyde drops the dummy and saunters forward
look at this junior here practically shit his pants
clyde drops down nose to nose with geoff whos still recovering
maybe youre too chicken to hang out with the rest of the boys
you gonna run home to daddy now
geoff brushes himself off and rises to his feet
he stares into clydes eyes
geoff pushes past clyde and moves on into the graveyard somehow managing to keep his dignity intact
drew follows then the rest of the boys leaving clyde staring after them standing alone with the dummy
gus squad car slows to a stop outside
gus swings open the door and ambles toward the porch
amanda draws back from the window mortified
she nervously crosses to the refrigerator and grabs a beer turning as gus enters
youre home early
just ran out of smokes
gus opens a kitchen drawer and fishes for a pack of cigarettes
he fires one up
wheres the boy
in his room
gus tightens his brow casting a suspicious eye
a sickened look flushes through amanda as gus pulls his eyes away from her and marches upstairs
his feet pound down the hallway
silence for an instant
then the powerful swing of drews door
followed by gus hastened return down the hallway
and as he hustles down the stairs
god damn it amanda
you want me to be a father to the boy and as soon as i lay down the law you let him break it
gus stops before amanda
where is he
one step away from terror amanda shakes her head
gus loses his patience
he rips the can of beer from her grip and sends it flying across the room
amanda sighs in quiet defeat
the pet sematary
gus turns away and heads out the door
wheels spin as gus squad car streaks off into the night
the cherry top glows to life bombarding the countryside
by now nearly two dozen costumed kids have gathered at the pet sematary
in the midst of the graves a small story telling campfire burns
a number of the boys sip beer trying to pretend that the bitter after taste doesnt bother them
clyde sits up front
at fourteen hes the elder statesmen of the group
with a beer in one hand and a cigarette in the other clyde is just finishing up a spooky yarn
yeah that old louis was one sick fuck
digging up little gage like so maggots pouring out of that kids eyes
he drags on his cigarette and puffs out a smoke ring
sees he still has an audience
ellie was the only creed that lived
then one night a few months later ellie freaks out and she hacks up her grandparents with an axe
beat police found her licking their brains off the blade
they locked her up in a psycho ward and all she said were two words pet sematary
clyde stares at the wide eyed kids
he grins takes a swig of beer and moves in for the kicker
heres the best part
two nights ago she escapes
word is she was heading for maine
man i hope she doesnt show up out here
feigning concern shit we wouldnt even notice her not if shes wearing a costume
she could be one of us
clyde casts a suspicious eye on the group
the kids uneasily look at each other making sure they know whos behind each and every costume
suddenly clyde drops his jaw in exaggerated horror
oh my goddd
clyde lifts a trembling finger pointing beyond the group of spellbound listeners
the kids are afraid to turn around assuming clydes rigged up some unspeakable terror
and for an instant a look of real horror washes over clydes face
is coming up the path beneath the archway rising out of the swirling mist
a frightening silhouette backlit by the moon
but then clyde realizes who it is
its drews dad
its fuckin gus
drew and the others quickly turn around realizing its not part of the punch line scare
the kids quickly scramble for hiding places in the bordering brush dropping their beer cans as fast as they can
as drew leaps to his feet he upsets the fire knocking one of the logs
a flaming ember rolls to the base of one of the brittle old crosses
drew and geoff run for it
gus moves quickly up the meandering path sending the blinding beam of his flashlight over the graves
you boys better not be drinking
through the thick woods drew is flanked by geoff and clyde
oh man hes gonna kick my ass
drew starts to take off
clyde trips him on his first stride
drew hits the dirt
thanks for fucking up our halloween dumbshit
clyde recedes into the woods as gus approaches the campfire
he scans the area with his flashlight illuminating the various beer cans
drew you get your ass out here
front and center
geoff pulls drew to his feet
gus passes the flashlight over the woods
kids duck away retreating from their hiding places
the flashlight sweeps toward drew
drew freezes spotlighted by gus beam
a burst of lightning floods drews horrified face
get out here joker
geoff remains frozen in the woods nearby out of gus light
behind gus the wooden cross is completely on fire now
you out here making a fool of me
drew shakes his head in instant denial
im warning you buddy
you dont play by the rules im gonna shadow your ass for eternity
drew makes a break from his spot in the woods
he weaves through the markers arcing around the outer perimeter to avoid gus
but gus is quicker
he zigzags through the crosses and headstones to intercept drew
gus gets a handful of drews collar and yanks him in
you little shit
gus draws his free arm back and smacks drew across the face
drew goes down
is looking on from the woods horrified
cowers on the ground trying to scramble away
geoff bolts out into the firelight staring defiantly at gus in silent accusation
gus is beyond furious
lightning flashes again
you get out of here geoff matthews
this is between me and my boy
geoff doesnt move
gus starts to advance forward
but the growl emanating from the woods gives him pause
a rustling is heard in the bushes and zowie emerges into the building firelight flashing his fangs at gus
his eyes glow red
gus freezes studying zowie
zowie inches forward poised for the attack
call off your dog drew
drew shifts his eyes from zowie to gus too terrified to heed such a command
zowie brushes past drew and geoff moving in on gus
gus eyes shift to burning cross at his side
with a swift boot he kicks over the cross and presses it into his grip
swinging the cross like a primitive weapon gus connects with the side of zowies head
zowie spins a full circle from the impact
but he lands on all fours
taking the next step toward gus
theres something clearly not of this world in zowies vicious stare
terrified drew call him off
all drew can manage is a faint appeal
zowie goes for gus launching into the air
and sinking his glistening fangs into gus neck
an eruption of blood showers the closest headstone
gus comes helplessly tumbling down with the weight of the dog
his screams are suddenly cut short as zowie rips out his throat
his arms flail weakly at his sides then grow still
drew and geoff stare at the scene wide eyed with shock
zowie looks up from gus neck with dripping red fangs
for a moment his eyes settle on drew
then zowie bolts off disappearing into the night
drews eyes shift to geoff whose face is flushed with sickened fear
a whisper is he dead
in dazed shock drew moves in for a closer look at the body
gus eyes are wide open
blood is still pumping in rhythm from his jugular with each weakening beat of his heart
its a gruesome image against the roaring fire
drew kneels at gus side
he wants to touch him
to shake him awake but with every attempt he draws his hand back
is he breathing
can you hear him breathing
drew leans forward turning his ear toward gus gaping mouth
and as he inches closer
his hand jerks up and closes around drews neck
gus stares up at him with his crazed menace
his fingers claw at gus hand desperate to pry it loose
but then gus hand relaxes as his last dying ounce of strength fades away
drew shrinks back crouching over the lifeless body as the blazing firelight dances over it
he turns his tear filled gaze to geoff
oh man geoff
we killed him
we killed him
beat whatre we gonna do
geoff draws closer and looks down into the dead mans face
we could bring him back
drews eyes widen at the suggestion
and now gazing down on gus body and on the boys we pull up we move ever higher until we are looking down upon the entire pet sematary
at the sound of a shovel cutting into rocky soil we
three quick shots a shovel sinking into the earth
gus falling head down into the grave landing with a heavy thud
soil covering gus lifeless face
amanda is pacing back and forth on the porch checking her watch every few steps
she sighs with relief as
drew appears from the darkness of the woods
drew dismounts his bike and carries it up the front porch steps strangely silent
his clothes and face are caked with dirt
jesus drew do you know what time it is
did gus ever find you
drew moves on past her into the house
calling after him drew
drew what happened
trying not to lose it nothing happened mom
we just ditched gus thats all
drew pauses and stares out into the unknown darkness of the night
chase is in the study perusing some files
he looks into the hallway as geoff arrives home then glances at the clock
hes both angry and relieved
right now though the angers winning out
were you drinking
geoff absently shakes his head
he slumps back against the wall drained from the nights horrors
drews mom called hours ago the rest of the kids were back by ten
where the hell were you boys
geoff shrugs trying to mask his uneasiness
well thats great geoff
beat look ive been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks but im not going to stand for crap like this
i dont care if its halloween
its a school night and if you do this again
cutting him off im really tired dad
can i just go to sleep
chase stops and looks at his son
geoffs exhaustion is self evident
sighing go on
well talk about this in the morning
geoff nods and heads for the stairs
the clock is creeping up on am
thunder rumbles outside in the distance and rain starts to spatter the window panes
geoffs eyelids fall beneath unbearable weight and he nods off to sleep
tiger is sprawled out on the blanket against his chest
slowly we move back towards the window
in a flash of lightning appears outside
washed in the haunting white glow
streaked with mud
caked with blood
staring in at geoff
geoff is jolted awake by the delayed clap of thunder and whips his gaze to the window
before he can focus
the pulse of lightning fades away
and with it gus face
only darkness remains beyond the window pane
geoff returns his gaze to the bedroom unaware of gus appearance
he sinks back to his pillow already hurtling towards sleep once more
moving in on the house we single out a rain obscured window on the ground floor the window to drews bedroom
drew is sound asleep curled up under the sheets
he clutches his pillow like a life preserver
drews eyes flutter open
he turns towards the window
now he hears some activity outside
and then gus hushed voice
i lost my keys
drew goes saucer eyed
he swallows the swelling lump in his throat and rises from his bed
drew steadies his quivering fingers just enough to sink the key into the deadbolt on the back door
drawing the creaking door open he gazes out back
scared shitless gus
nothing moves outside
the longer drew watches the more eerie each shadow becomes
spooked drew steps back inside quickly closing the door
he locks it back up again
when he turns around hes face to face with gus
drew stiffens backing into the wall
h howd you get in
gus offers a nightmarish grin and raises his hand dangling his keys
drews eyes follow a flow of blood from gus neck to the floor
gus looks down at his dirty bloody footprints
hes tracked blood all over the linoleum
im makin a mess of your mothers kitchen floor
beat i need a shower
gus turns without another word and heads for the stairs
drews mouth drops in utter astonishment as he watches gus clumsily climbing the stairs
after a moment he returns his attention to the bloody kitchen floor
tearing off a wad of paper towels he wets them and begins to mop up gus tracks
gazing vacantly at his reflection gus covers his ravaged throat with a gauze strip wrapping it around the circumference of his neck again and again and again
behind him the shower is running filling up the bathroom with steam
finishing the dressing off with a sloppy tape job gus reaches for the pajamas hanging nearby
he lazily buttons the buttons failing to notice their alignment is off
he never did bother to shower
hes still covered with mud
gus enters from the steamy bathroom
the shower is still running
amanda stirs sleepy eyes focusing on him
im sorry about tonight
you coming to bed
gus lifts the covers and climbs in
with him comes the chill of death
gus presses up behind her
his hand moves beneath the sheets finding its way over the curve of her waist caressing
god youre ice cold
turning and you smell
lord what did you get yourself into
its then that amanda sees the bandage around gus neck
blood is seeping through the gauze
my god gus what happened
amanda reaches out to touch him but gus stops her hand short of the bandage
instead he leans forward and clutches one of her breasts
amanda tries to twist away
whats wrong with you
but gus doesnt stop
he throws himself on top of amanda roughly forcing her back onto the bed
amandas hands beat at gus face and back to no apparent effect
with one arm forced against amandas throat he rips open her nightgown with the other
we pull away from amandas struggles back to the bathroom
the shower running on and on cloaking the bedroom in steam
geoff is riding along the highway his backpack full of school books
drew is waiting on the shoulder ahead
when geoff approaches drew hops on his bike getting up to speed
geoff keeps glancing at drew waiting for him to say something
drew maintains his enigmatic expression
geoffs eyes widen in disbelief
gus comes down to breakfast and he doesnt say a word
he even kind of smiles like he forgot he hates me
and then you know what he does
he serves me an extra helping of pancakes
beat i asked him if i was still grounded
i asked him if you could spend the night and he nods
its like were a family
a real family
the words have their own meaning for geoff who stares to the road ahead in deep thought
what do you mean
its like hes not gus anymore
you know like zowie
they share a chuckle that ends in silent uneasiness
chase enters with a stack of files tucked under his arm
as he organizes them in the large filing cabinet with the others he listens to his messages on the answering machine
the current caller sounds a little annoyed
doctor matthews this is elliot rudman at the university
ive looked over the blood specimen you sent us on canine zowie
chase abandons the filing and immediately returns the call
while it rings
knock knock doc
a mother and two toddlers are standing in the doorway to chases office trying not to intrude on his call
quiet whisper we saw your sign
are there any kitties left
chase studies them
they look like decent people
take your pick
theyre in the boarding area
you can go on back
chase turns away as his phone call is answered
elliot its chase
elliot rudman has the phone tucked under his chin in the midst of an autopsy
the whirr of the saw drowns out his words as he shaves the dome off a dogs skull
i didnt get that
the pathologist turns off the saw
his words become audible
i said next time it might help if you took the blood sample while the animal was still alive
the comment hits chase out of left field
i dont know what you expected to find matthews
theres nothing wrong with the antigens nothing to indicate an unusual death
wait there must be some mix up
the dog is alive
not this dog
there wasnt enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea
chase is baffled speechless
you took over for doctor yolander
because the last person that sent me blood from a dead animal was yolander
the kennels have been cleaned up but the room retains its eerie dimly lit quality
the drip of a faucet reverberates from the far corner
the mother enters with a toddler clinging to each hand
their smiles fade at the unsettling surroundings
slowly they move down the row of kennels
where are the kitties
into the phone look this is ridiculous
suddenly blood curdling screams pierce the air
chase drops the phone and rushes out of the office
the toddlers are screaming at the top of their lungs
mom is burying their heads in her dress
chase bursts in as the mother hastily retreats for the exit
her horrified eyes flash by chase
in an instant she and the toddlers are gone
chase remains alone moving down the long row of kennels with mounting trepidation
zowies cage is empty
chase shifts his troubled gaze to the
drip drip drip
as a puddle of blood forms on the floor
chase raises his eyes
nothing but bloody ribbons of torn flesh are left of the kittens dangling from the grid gate
chase looks away as a new level of fear runs through him
its too gruesome even for a man of chases background
fighting the gag reflex he searches the room for the missing dog
and then he spots the broken glass window vent along the floor
and the pile of blood spattered shards laying on the tile
clyde stevie and brad are loitering near the front bike racks
clydes smoking away
as geoff and drew come out of the school the trio moves to intercept them
just then chases van pulls at the curb interrupting whatever trouble was about to happen
clyde looks from the van to geoff and falls back
saved by the bell
chase hurriedly rolls down the passenger window as geoff and drew approach
can i sleep over at drews tonight
chase is preoccupied with other concerns
beat listen drew i got the tests back on zowie
hes not well
dont ask me how but he got out this afternoon
geoff and drew exchange concerned looks
if he finds his way home call me no matter what the hour okay
and dont try to approach him
whatever hes got might be infectious
the boys nod their heads
chase masks his anxiety with a weary smile
with a wave he speeds up leaving the boys
a map of maine is unfolded on the passenger seat
chase is on the car phone
can i have the address for quentin yolander
chase jots an address down on the map
he turns the van up a mountain road winding through the towering pines
a remote rustic dwelling nestled into the desolate backwoods
quentin yolander rocks back in his thick hide chair
his world is closed off from daylight by the extensive blinds
hes holding a small poodle in his lap
its big brown eyes are staring back at him
youd be so much more interesting with blue eyes
and now one of the poodles eyes pops out
yolanders finger comes through from beneath the eye socket
on closer examination we realize that the dog is not alive at all
yolander has his hand inside the hollowed out carcass
he carefully looks over a container of glass eyes on his desk and selects the right shade of blue
a shot of whiskey rests nearby
yolander reaches up into the poodles belly and fits the blue eyes securely into place
theres a knock at the door
yolander ignores it
maybe hes deaf
yolander turns towards the door annoyed at the intrusion
and behind that annoyance theres a touch of madness
pulling back we see the rest of the room
stuffed animals are crowded from floor to ceiling
a product of yolanders obsession with taxidermy
im immortalizing a poodle
state your business
yolander presses some stuffing into the poodles gut and begins to sew up the stomach
this is chase matthews
ive moved into your offices in ludlow
yolanders attention remains on the needle as he meticulously stitches the belly
continuing i sent a blood sample out for analysis
they tell me i sent them the blood of a dead animal
at this yolander breaks his concentration
the needle pricks his hand
blood oozes from the puncture dripping onto the dogs stomach
yolander rises from his seat and swings open the door
chase stands in the doorway startled
it doesnt take a genius to figure out that the good doctor is drunk
glaring why are you bothering me about this
cant you leave it be
chase glances to the right and steps back
is perched nearby frozen in mid pounce
it takes a second for chase to register that the bobcat has been stuffed
now chase sees the rest of the room
a whole zoo of stuffed animals looking like a rural version of the bates motel
momentarily thrown the pathologist
he said that you had reported a similar incident
with a cat
the creed cat thats right
bastards name was church
grins let me guess
your dogs tissue isnt healing pupils arent dilating
maybe you cant find a heartbeat
i thought it might be some sort of blood condition
immune deficiency or
quentin yolander laughs
theres no blood condition
the dog isnt sick its dead
drawing closer and so was creeds cat
and so was his wife the night she was killed for the second time
as yolander moves forward chase backs up
he bumps into a whole shelf of stuffed creatures
to his right a raven sits frozen on its perch
chase regards yolander as being completely insane
menacing you want some advice friend
you get in your car you pick up your family
and you get the hell out of that town
chase continues to back out of the door
on his way out he bumps into the stuffed ravens perch
only this raven isnt stuffed
it spreads its wings and chase just about jumps out of his skin tripping out of the doorway
gus reaches into the cage and grabs a rabbit by the ears
he casually snaps the neck
laying the limp carcass on a stump cutting board he quickly skins it
hanging above the cages there is now a line of furry pelts
half a dozen
drew and geoff are on the porch looking on
i guess were having rabbit for dinner
gus hangs the freshly skinned fur to dry and violently snatches another hare from the cage
the dinner from hell
geoff splats a helping of mashed potatoes onto his plate all the while keeping a wary eye on gus
gus is serving himself a chunk of rabbit
it hits the edge of the plate teetering on the rim
he passes the dish on
gus meets geoffs gaze
for a moment theres a deadened vacant look in gus eyes
then slowly a limp smile creeps over him sending a chill up geoffs spine
geoff averts gus stare
gus helps himself to potatoes and passes the plate on
he lets go of it short of reaching drew
only drews quick hands save it from hitting the table
amanda comes to the table with a dish of lima beans
she casts gus a cold hateful stare and sets the limas down
shes still angry over last night
gus dishes a sloppy scoop and passes it toward drew
like before he lets it drop too early
this time drew doesnt save it
the lima beans shower the floor
god damnit gus
this isnt funny
amanda fetches a dishtowel and kneels to clean up the mess
geoff and drew exchange quick glances
as geoff reaches for the salt
gus intercepts his wrist
gus drops his jaw revealing a gooey mass of food
but the frozen smile and the look in his eyes convey dementia rather than playfulness
geoff and drew cant believe their eyes
they laugh uncomfortably
theres no other response
gus laughs too
awkward terrible laughter
spitting out food over his shirt and plate as he does so
the boys stop laughing but gus just keeps on going
amanda stares at gus and carries the mess out of the room
through his laughter gus bandage has slipped down exposing part of his ragged wound
the wound glistens oozing clotted blood and drew hesitantly reaches for gus neck readjusting the bandage
grossed out geoff averts his eyes and sets his fork aside
geoff and drew enter
drew swiftly secures the deadbolts on his door
what was that all about
you think hes trying to scare us
i dont know but im not taking any chances
drew opens the chest at the foot of his bed and produces a shotgun
a box full of shells spill as he withdraws the gun
cracking open the chamber drew loads two shells into the chamber
a moonlit horizon
the kind of silence that pulls at the darkest recesses of imagination
and now a lone figure appears on the horizon
its zowie moving at a deliberate pace
zowie takes pause
the tinkling of his collar tags resumes as he drops over the horizon line cutting down the hill
chase sits in the den looking exhausted and disheveled
in front of him the t
renees face stares out at us
chase hits the remote and rises moving to the back door
he checks the deadbolt then secures the chain link as a backup
from somewhere outside we hear a dog howl
chases eyes drop to the doggy door a holdover from the previous owner
chase bends down and latches the door
now he pauses at his desk
then pulls something out of the bottom drawer
its a gun
chase moves to the front of the house securing that door
satisfied he turns off the light and heads upstairs
moving into darkness shadow and form begin to take shape
we hear a low growl and see a flash of red eyes
already in the house
coming through the door from the downstairs chase stops cold
renee is on the bed
clothed in a negligee
lying across a blanket of rose petals
her eyes meet his with powerful longing
i miss you so much
dry mouthed renee
fearful that this is all a dream
renee reaches out her hand
this is not a dream
chase absently sets his gun on the bedside table as renee draws his body to hers
not a dream
renee rolls chase over forcefully climbing on top
chase sinks down into the center of the bed as renee straddles him
slowly renee slips off the top of her negligee
a whisper i can come back chase
and sinks down on top of him kissing him hungrily
her nipples graze his chest then her breasts flatten as she grinds her hips against his
almost instantly the weight of her grows unbearable
chase fights to pull his mouth from hers to breathe
there is no pleasure in his words just unmitigated horror as renees body comes down on him harder
pop open frenzied as he comes out of his dream
chase is alone on the bed but hes still feeling the weight pressing down on him
is laying on his chest staring back at him rearing his teeth in a growl
zowie lunges forward jaws flashing and chase twists sideways
gnashing teeth connect with chases shoulder then with the pillows where chases head used to be
a blizzard of down feathers chase scrambles out of bed flailing for the gun on the bedside table
the gun spins out of reach and across the floor
chase dives for the gun and reaches it just as zowie leaps to the floor
in a panic chase fires wild
zowie abruptly turns and smashes through the bedroom window sending glass flying
zowie slides down the room and leaps to the ground below disappearing into the night
chase looks on in terror
finally he pulls his eyes away from the shattered window
and catches a glimpse of something in the dresser mirror
something that sends a chill up his spine
the flurry of down feathers is floating to the mattress
but intermingling with the feathers are a handful of rose petals slowly settling to the bed
chase is bare chested at the mirror applying a dressing to the dog bite on his shoulder
marjorie appears in the doorway with a basket of laundry
she stops short at the sight of chase standing there in his boxers
chase catches her reflection in the mirror and is startled
i didnt mean to
i was going to empty the hamper
chase turns shaking off the scare
marjories eyes cant help but fix on the dog bites scattered over chases chest and arms
what happened to you
i had a little run in with zowie
you sure did
marjorie sets the laundry aside
here let me do that
marjorie looks over the antiseptics chase has laid out on the sink
saturating a wad of gauze with hydrogen peroxide she gently cleanses the gashes on his arms
theres nothing overtly sexual in her actions but the gentleness of her touch doesnt go unnoticed by chase
i hope he doesnt have rabies
i dont know what he has but im hoping to god its not infectious
chase stops and looks at marjories reflection in the mirror
what do you know about the creed murders
marjorie stiffens for a moment
obviously the creeds are a sore spot for the people in this town
did you ever play that game where you pass a story down a row of people and see how screwed up it gets by the time its done
people say louis creeds son came back from the dead and it drove him crazy
she rolls her eyes he killed his wife and himself and thats the end of story
anything else belongs in the national enquirer
marjorie tapes the bandage over chases shoulder too tight
chases groan snaps her back to the reality at hand
now tell me what that has to do with zowie
chase closes his eyes shutting out the pain
i wish i knew
chase approaches the counter looking to the elderly librarian for assistance
what are you looking for hon
do you have anything on the creed murders
i cant find the microfilm from that period
the librarians smile vanishes
she lowers her voice focusing her attention on some paperwork
we dont keep anything on file from that far back
but youve got files from the previous years
we have nothing on the creed murders sir
can i get you something else
chase looks around and realizes that a dozen hostile eyes are on him
townspeople withholding a dark secret
chase slowly backs away eager to escape the field of hostile stares
geoff and drew have parked their bikes beneath the bridge
they sit on the bank of the creek below watching the water run past
geoff is lost in thought
do you think everyone that came back would be like gus
i dont know
thinking maybe it depends on what you were like before you
he tosses a stone into the creek then looks up at the sun and sighs
i gotta go back and do my chores
drew shakes his head
gusd kill me if i showed up late
the boys reluctantly rise and move to their bikes walking them up the steep grade to the highway
see you at school monday
he looks at drew
the boy is genuinely frightened
but theres nothing either of them can do
theyre trapped in their roles as kids
both boys mount their bikes
you ever think about running away
all the time
drew smiles at this
he waves to geoff and pedals off
calling back see ya
geoff waves and heads off in the opposite direction
as he moves down the road
up ahead we hear the approaching whine of a motorcycle
rips by on an old junkyard fixer up motorcycle and hes heading in geoffs direction
seeing him drew brakes and pulls his bike into a u turn pumping furiously to catch up with geoff
now geoff hears the whine of clydes motorcycle
he glances back
clydes spotted him revving the engine
geoff pedals like mad but its no use
clyde is closing in on him grinning sadistically
clyde sweeps in next to him calling out over the engine
well look whos here
clyde veers right forcing geoff towards the shoulder of the road
the ground ahead drops toward a ravine
geoff has nowhere to go but down the slope
clyde is right there beside him
laughing clyde reaches over and grabs ahold of geoffs handlebar
he jerks it sideways
geoffs front wheel turns perpendicular
the bike pitches forward throwing geoff into the dirt ahead
clyde broadies his bike to a stop
with the engine idling he hops off
before geoff can get to his feet clyde has picked up geoffs bike and planted it upside down in the dirt
guess your dads not here to save you now is he
clyde gets a handful of geoffs collar and drags him over toward the bike
with his free hand clyde cranks the pedal
the back wheel spins
faster and faster
you ever seen a tire take off a nose
through the blur of the spokes we see geoff eyes widening fearfully
neither have i
clyde forces geoffs face toward the spinning tread
might even kill ya
wheel might chew right into your brains
you could visit your mom
geoff tries to get a hold on the frame of the bike for leverage but his arms dont reach beyond the spinning wheel
clyde is full of deranged glee fueled by geoffs fear
but now a hand grabs the wool scarf streaming from the back of clydes neck and yanks him off of geoff
clyde reels finding
gus standing there behind him
he looks bad
his bandages are unwound and his ruined neck is still seeping
his face is unearthly pale
hes deteriorated considerably since yesterday
startled jesus christ gus
gus levels a threatening gaze at geoff
but geoff remains frozen
gus fixes him with a stare that could turn flesh to stone
geoff snaps out of it and flips his bike over
he gets a running start making a beeline for the highway without ever looking back
drew stops short of the ravine watching from afar as gus steps toward clyde
clyde throws up his hands
hes frightened but he tries to muster up a cocky front
come on gus i was just fucking with him
nervous laughter whatre you gonna do
give me a ticket
i mean shit gus
clyde grows increasingly wary of gus evil stare
gus steps closer
you cant lay a finger on me
gus lashes out backhanding clyde across the face
clyde falls to the ground flat on his back with his nose gushing blood
gus turns around and lifts the idling motorcycle
with one hand under the back of the seat and the other working the accelerator handlebar gus advances toward clyde
gus kicks the bike into gear and revs the accelerator
the rear wheel spins
on the pavement it would be moving forty miles an hour
clyde cant believe his eyes
what are you doing
im just fucking with you
gus plants his foot against clydes chest pinning him and lowers the spinning rear wheel toward clydes neck
the wheel whines like a circular saw
gus lowers the wheel
then jerks it away flashing a sadistic smile
just when clyde thinks gus is backing off the wheel comes down again
wailing stop it man
gus gets into the rhythm as he lowers and retracts the spinning wheel at the terrified bully
but this time as the wheel comes down
clydes wool scarf defying gravity gets swept up swallowed into the gears
and along with the scarf here comes clydes screaming face
we can only imagine the gruesome instant that follows
blood sprays up over gus arms and chest
and then we hear the sound of crunching bones jamming the motorcycles gears
dead pan whoops
he bares his teeth in a deaths head grin
drew has witnessed the killing
gus tosses the bloody motorcycle aside slowly raising his eyes up to where drew stands
his eyes meet drews
drew hastily jerks his bike around and takes off
gus starts after him on foot
drew rushes through the front door slamming it behind him and throwing the deadbolt
drew climbs onto his bed and grabs his shotgun from the gun rack
his fingers shake as he flips off the safety
just then we hear the crackle of a police p
and gus amplified voice coming from the yard outside
mocking this is the police come out of the house with your hands up
gus finishes his words with a burst of feedback and then amplified drews eyes go wide with terror
he creeps out into the hall clutching the gun
drew tries to look out the window
then we hear a low guttural growl
drew slowly turns
zowie is standing down the hall leveling a dead stare
zowie takes the first step forward
horrified no zowie
pleading drew slowly retreats down the hallway
along the way he backs right into
gus grinning from ear to ear
drew recoils against the wall swinging up his shotgun
but gus just keeps on grinning
he takes a step forward
drew pulls the trigger
the chambers are empty
forget something drew buddy
gus raises his hand
hes holding the shotgun shells
he lets them fall to the floor
suddenly gus wrenches the gun from drews hands
he swings it and
drew screams and ducks beneath the blow as the shotgun butt smashes a hole in the wall above his head
gus flings the shotgun aside and lunges for drew
drew races down the hallway to the back door
he turns the latch
the deadbolt has been locked from the inside
drews eyes whip to the keyholder on the wall
all the keyhooks are empty
here comes the jingling of keys in gus pockets as he comes down the hall
drew dashes away from the back door
gus eyes shift from drews fleeing form to a box of tools in the service closet
drew jimmies the knob
again the deadbolt is locked from the inside
tears are streaming down drews face now
drew spins around
gus is advancing with a hammer tight in his grip
crazed you have the right to remain silent
gus smashes the hammer into the wall to punctuate his words
plaster goes flying
continuing while i bash your fucking head in
drews eyes dart frantically looking for a way out
the closest route of escape is up the stairs
down the hallway zowie starts running forward
drews caught between a rock and a hard place
you have the right to a lawyer but you wont need one
he runs for it
gus charges to intercept him
drew gets to the stairs first
cause youll be dead
gus brings the hammer down with the claw end leading
it sinks into the stair below drews feet
zowie leaps past gus tearing up the stairs as gus wrenches the hammer free
drew makes it to the top of the stairs with zowie right on his heels
drew dives into amanda and gus bedroom as
zowie springs from the floor
drew slams the door shut smacking zowie
zowie collapses to the floor dazed
drew throws the latch on the door
almost immediately gus is outside pounding at the door with the claw end of the hammer
wood splinters fly as the hammer claw sinks through
drew screams and goes for one of the dormer windows
its stuck he cant get it open
from the hallway gus violently smashes the door again and again
the door is splintering apart
we see glimpses of gus through the ragged holes
do you understand these rights drew buddy
drew grabs a chair and heaves it through the window
the bedroom door explodes inward and gus claws his way into the room
wasting no time drew climbs through the broken window
drew slides down the slant of the roof
he hits the lattice and takes it to the ground with him
untangling himself he gets to his feet
and here comes amanda arriving home
drew runs for her car waving his hands throwing himself into her path so shell go no further
she slams on the brakes
drew pulls open the passenger door and dives inside
gus killed clyde mom
hes trying to kill me
just then the back door flies open
gus steps out
daddys not done yet
amanda spots the hammer hanging from his grip
gus cracks a sick smile and flings the hammer at the car
the hammer bounces off the windshield causing it to spiderweb
thats all the convincing amanda needs
she puts the car into reverse and stomps on the gas
speeding down the highway
drew and amanda are mortified
suddenly we hear the wail of gus patrol car coming up from behind
amanda looks to the rear view mirror
approaching from the road ahead is a potato truck
amanda hips her head back in front of them
the potato truck is blaring its horn
gus car swerves out onto the shoulder speeding up to match her pace
gus cranks the wheel jumping back onto the road forcing amandas car into the path of the oncoming truck
the driver stands on the brakes
thousands of potatoes explode from the rear of the truck obscuring our view
gus vehicle speeds past
we hold on the mess of twisted steel
clearly there are no survivors
geoff enters first
wearing a dark suit
looking pale and empty inside
chase follows dressed in black
its obvious theyve been to a funeral
without a word geoff heads up the stairs
chase watches on feeling utterly helpless
chase exits from his bedroom pulling a sweater over a more casual change of clothes
he cocks his head at the sounds of geoff moving about in the attic above
the door atop the attic stairway is barely ajar
chase wrinkles his brow concerned
turning away he heads downstairs
marjorie is preparing dinner
across the room the kitchen tv is playing
on television is the evening news
a photo of drew and amanda appears above the newscaster
friends and neighbors came to pay respects for drew and amanda gilbert who died in a head on collision saturday
chase enters the kitchen eyes moving to the tv
those poor people
i saw gus this morning
he looked terrible
chase pulls his eyes away from the broadcast as marjorie sets dinner on the table
chase yells upstairs
geoff dinners ready
after no reply geoff
im not hungry
chase gives marjorie an apologetic look and rises from the table
meanwhile the news broadcast continues
a photo of clyde appears on the screen
in other news the disappearance of a ludlow youth remains a mystery
clyde parker was last seen on saturday afternoon
his motorcycle was found off highway
chase pushes open the door
a spring coil pulls the creaking door closed behind him
one look at the attic and chase turns pale
a huge window at the far end of the room allows the moonlight to reach all corners of the spacious old attic
all of renees belongings have been unpacked
the entire attic has been converted into a museum like room down to the last meticulous detail
a room in preparation for renees return
gauzy curtains billow out from some unseen draft
pictures of renee rest everywhere
geoff is seated before the brightly lit three way theatrical mirror casually setting out renees make up
what are you doing
theres an obsessive dementia in geoffs gaze
im getting things ready for mom
obviously the strain of drews funeral has proven too much for geoff
he moves closer
gently mom is dead geoff
you know that
a creepy smile flickers across geoffs face
she doesnt have to be
chase freezes as a chill runs up his spine
what are you talking about
i can bring her back
the same way drew and me brought zowie back
at this chase is positively spooked
geoff this is crazy
zowie didnt die
we buried him
intense theres a place out in the woods
if you bury something there it comes back alive
chase stares at his son
this is insane
it must be
just then the phone rings downstairs
geoff continues to stare at his father
we tried it on zowie first
and then we did it again when zowie killed gus
drew didnt want gus to be dead so we brought him back too
its too much for chase
his mouth is hanging agape
outside the attic door doctor matthews youve got a call
its the caretaker at the funeral home
something about your wifes grave
chase nods in private acknowledgement
he stares at geoff as he backs away
just relax okay
im going to take this call and ill be right back
geoff doesnt respond
chase pulls open the door and leaves
chase is on the phone
the callers words bring grave concern to chase
christ ill be right there
chase hangs up stunned
he turns to marjorie whos watching him with a concerned gaze
hurried marjorie i need you to stay late
geoff is really upset and i have to take care of this
dont let him leave the house alright
chase is out the door before she has a chance to respond
geoff is laying on his mothers bed weeping
tiger sits at the foot of the bed
suddenly she wakens and hisses
from out of the darkness
enters frame gently touching geoffs side
and with its arrival so comes her eerie lullaby
a whisper i need you geoff
slowly raises his head bewildered
renees hand withdraws into the darkness
he reaches out for her but shes gone
the lullaby remains beckoning from down the attic stairs
the attic door slowly swings open of its own accord
geoff rises from the bed and follows
geoff looks into the living room as he passes
marjorie has fallen asleep on the sofa with the tv on
the lullaby drifts from beyond the deadfall
the fog rolls inward towards the distant burial ground
as geoff moves towards the deadfall the fog converges around him
the lure of renees lullaby pulls geoff deeper into the woods
we hear the unearthly animal howl once more
chases van pulls to a stop behind a maintenance vehicle
chase is greeted by the limping caretaker who quickly leads him off across the rolling hillside
sorry to disturb you doctor matthews but i thought youd want to come have a look for yourself
its the damndest thing
chase stops cold gazing at the ground before him in disbelief
the grave is a gaping cavity
the casket has been unearthed
renees body is missing
uncomprehending gus did this
nodding he stuck around after the funeral
told me he had an order to exhume your wife
i didnt think much of it until i saw him drag the body out of the coffin
shakes his head he put your wife in his truck and drove off right through amanda and drews headstones
the caretaker points across the hillside
tire tracks cut through the manicured grass cutting a path of destruction right through the field of headstones and on through the fence
i swear nothing this weird has happened since louis creed dug up his boy
beat you want me to notify the authorities
chase doesnt answer he just storms past the caretaker
the van is speeding down the dark open highway
chase is on the car phone frantic waiting as it rings
theres finally an answer
doctor yolander this is chase matthews we spoke the other day
yolander cuts him off
bitter you didnt leave town did you
yolander sits in the darkness a bottle of whiskey and a tumbler at his side
his creatures are all around him eyes glowing with reflected moonlight
his voice is slurred
the voice of someone whos already damned
you sorry bastard
i have nothing more to say to you matthews
desperate look just tell me one thing
did i treat an animal that had been brought back to life
what do you think
chase grips the carphone tightly his knuckles white
believe what you saw matthews
the dog was dead
mounting horror how is that possible
you have to help me doctor yolander
i dont know what im dealing with here
theyve dug up my wife
cutting him off im retired from my practice matthews
its your practice now and its your problem
beat god help you
dont hang up
but yolander does
and now we hear the dial tone
chase flings the carphone down looking up as
an approaching potato truck zooms by
a blaring horn
chase barely swerves out of the way
recovering from the scare chase reaches over and opens the glove compartment
he pulls out his gun and sets it on the seat next to him
geoff climbs the stone steps reaching the flattop meas
he stops short looking over the clearing
is standing in the center of the burial ground
hes humming mimicking renees feminine tone
now he stops and slowly turns regarding geoff with dead eyes
hes holding a pickaxe and shovel at his side
gus looks to the ground at his side
geoff follows his gaze
as if it had been uprooted from her resting place at pleasantville and set down right in the middle of the micmac ground
and now the vision of renees grave fades away
in its place is a bundle of white renees shrouded body
gus raises the pickaxe offering it to geoff
you bury your own geoff
geoff slowly nods and approaches seduced beyond reason
marjorie stirs on the couch blinking her eyes open at the sound of a thud upstairs
otherwise the house is dark and silent
marjorie starts up the long dark flight of stairs to the attic
the thin night shirt shes wearing does little to protect her from the sudden cold
she clutches herself shivering
you okay up there
marjorie cautiously pushes open the door
her concern for geoff is forgotten as she beholds the renee hallow memorabilia
she moves about renees unpacked belongings in bewildered reverence
the gauzy curtains billow about marjorie like ghosts
and then she glimpses something beyond the curtains
stands in the shadows wearing the beaded peach dress that marjorie had admired earlier
for a moment we think its renee but as marjorie draws closer we see that the dress has been fitted onto a dressmakers model
marjorie lays a hand on the fabric feeling the contours of the design
chases headlights sweep across the front of the dark house
pulling to a stop chase opens the vans door
leaps out of the darkness sinking his teeth into chases shoulder
chase is thrown back over the car seat grappling with the nightmare dog as it tears into him again and again
chase screams reaching back for the gun
he grabs hold of it and swings it around
zowie is blown backwards clear out of the car spraying chase with blood
zowie lands outside on his feet looking stunned
his chest is a ruined mess
zowie whimpers and drags himself weakly towards the front porch
chase stumbles out of the van clutching the gun
hes bleeding profusely
an old saw is laying in a pile of sawdust next to a square hole thats been cut in the base of the front door
chase gives it a look as he tries the door
chase enters bringing with him an illuminating swath from his headlights
chases headlights stream through the windows distorting the interior
the house looks like its been through a tornado
a trail of bloody paw prints leads into the kitchen
the stench is repulsive
grimacing chase has to keep himself from gagging
as chase moves forward he catches sight of
standing in a swath of light
at gus feet is zowie tongue lolling out of his mouth
dead for the second time
scattered around the dog are various tools
propped against the wall is the cut out square of wood
its fitted with hinges at the top
gus what are you doing
gus glances down at the dead dog
dead pan i was building a doggy door
god damn it gus you dug up my wife
what the fuck is going on around here
gus brings a cordless electric drill up from his side pointing it at chase in a threatening manner
grins a little drilling
a little killing
as gus moves forward chase gets a good look at him for the first time
he doesnt look even remotely alive
chase levels his gun with a trembling hand
gus stabs the air with the drill feeding on chases horror
chase pulls the trigger
a bullet pounds gus chest
a spray of flesh explodes from his back
unphased gus regains his balance
god i hate when that happens
before chase can squeeze off the next round gus rips the gun from his grip
you got a permit for that
opening the chamber gus empties the remaining bullets and tosses the gun aside
didnt think so
gus fires up the drill
the bit spinzzzzzz
he dives at chase knocking him back against the counter
the drill bit sinks into chase screams as gus withdraws it
now he presses it into chases shoulder
chase is on the verge of blacking out now
the pain is unbearable
gus withdraws the drill once again aiming now for chases eye
maniacal no brain no pain chase
think about it
the whirling drill bit is millimeters away from chases eye
he clutches gus arm trying to force the drill aside
at the last second adrenaline kicks in and chase diverts the drill
it sinks into the counter top nearby
gus roars lashing out but chase manages to duck away
chase catches sight of his gun on the floor
he scrambles for it scooping it up
bullets are rolling across the floor every which way
chase slaps his palm down on one and desperately fumbles with the chamber
gus hands clamp down around chases neck
he swings chase around and slams him against the wall lifting him off his feet
chase gasps as the life is literally crushed out of him
he brings the gun up beneath gus chin and jams it into his ruined throat
gus just keeps on throttling him
insane just remember chase
i had renee first
and now im gonna have her last
the top of gus head blows off
his body is thrown back by the incredible force tumbling him to the kitchen floor with a chase sucks in precious air then his head snaps up
chase stumbles from the house
its a wonder hes even conscious
he swings open the van door and throws himself inside sinking the key into the ignition
marjorie is now seated before renees theatrical make up mirror entranced
shes wearing the beaded peach dress
with the help of renees vast array of cosmetics marjorie has turned herself into a stunning beauty
the lipstick isnt quite right
turning to the countertop magnifying mirror she carefully touches up her ruby red lips
her face fills nearly the entire mirror
except for one rim which reflects the dark shadowy attic behind her
a huge eye joins her reflection in the distorting mirror
marjorie nearly jumps out of her skin
she spins around
dont sneak up on me like that
but no one is there
the make up mirror catches another glimpse
renees red lips magnified tenfold
the lips begin to move
a whisper did you really think you could be like me
renees fist swings in smashing a panel of the mirror
marjorie raises her hands to protect herself against the flying glass
and as her hands come down she finds
renee standing before her
her ghostly form silhouetted by moonlight
curtains billowing around her
we never fully see her
marjories face goes white with fear
such a young face
but youve got potential
renee grabs a fistful of marjories hair viciously yanking her head back
well do the eyes first
you always start with the eyes
renee lashes out slashing a mirror shard across the skin beneath marjories right eye
geoff awakens at the commotion upstairs
he rocks forward rising from his bed
geoff pauses at the base of the attic stairway looking up at the open door
all he hears are the faint sounds of movement
you know youre not supposed to be in the attic
geoff starts up the stairs
geoff trepidatiously enters
he weaves through the maze of gauzy curtains
and then he sees her
renee is standing in the midst of the attic
shes perfectly made up
just as she was on the day she died
she smiles warmly
i came back for you geoff
were going to be together again
renee raises her outstretched arms to receive him
through the haze of his tears geoff doesnt see the sinister vacant gleam in her eyes
reaching the house chase skids to a stop across the lawn
chase cautiously enters with the gun in his grasp
the spring coil swings the creaking door shut behind him
from chases vantage point he cant see them yet
he makes his way around the stripped dressmakers model past an upright dressing mirror
and then he sees
slumped against renees bed like a ragdoll
we can only see half of her face
it looks untouched
chase reaches for her
marjories head rolls sideways exposing the other half of her face
the skin has been stripped from her skull and peeled back
chase turns his head away
and thats when he sees them
holding each other tightly
geoff has his head buried in renees breast
renee looks up from her son meeting chases gaze
her voice is both seductive and terrifying
the word horror doesnt do the moment justice
oh my god
we can try again chase
we can make it work this time
chase sinks back against the wall
hes lost a lot of blood and his strength is leaving him
shaking his head no
dont you love me anymore chase
youre not renee
get over here now
but geoff just holds his mother tighter
a hint of annoyance flickers through renees eyes
she strokes geoffs hair
looking at chase geoff honey why dont you go downstairs
your father and i need a moment alone
do it for me
geoff looks up at his mother mesmerized
she releases him from the embrace
he brushes past chase without a glance and heads for the attic door
geoff pauses at the door looking back
renees words have a hauntingly familiar ring
i love you
turning away he opens the door and
is standing there an axe perched on his shoulder
his face is torn to shit bones and brain matter exposed
hes covered from head to toe in dirt and clotted blood
he looks worse than any of the undead weve seen
a total walking nightmare
grinning hey junior
clyde swings the axe sinking it into the wall just in front of geoffs face
geoff tumbles back onto the floor snapping out of his trance
clyde brings the axe down
and geoff rolls to the side barely avoiding decapitation
chase stumbles forward to rescue his son
as he does so clyde brings the axe back up smashing chase in the head with the blunt end
chase goes down
looks like daddy got a boo boo
clyde turns his gaze back on geoff
now where were we
geoff shuffles backwards across the floor as clyde moves into the room
renee passes behind clyde
she slams the attic door shut and snaps off the knob with a jerk of the wrist locking them all inside
scared out of his wits geoff makes it to his feet
clyde swings again and misses
geoff grabs hold of the axe handle struggling and the two boys go down
moves to the vanity
she sweeps a hand across it sending everything crashing to the ground
crystal perfume bottles shatter spilling their contents over the floor
renee reaches for a lighter and flicks it on
she touches the flame to the perfume soaked floor
flames roar into existence racing across the floorboards igniting the curtains
we see the flames reflected in renees soulless eyes
as they wrestle with one another across the floor
bloody spittle drips from clydes face
he flashes a feral snarl
clyde lunges forward and tears into geoffs shoulder with his teeth
his hands grope blindly for a weapon and close on a mirror shard
he jabs it up and into clydes eye
somehow geoff manages to roll out from under clyde
he rises to his feet
clyde lets loose a demonic roar
he charges slashing the axe wildly knocking aside curtains and dressing models alike
nothings going to stop him
flames are consuming the attic licking the rafters igniting the canopy drapings
smoke is rolling across the floor
geoff reaches a far wall
hes trapped in a corner
theres nowhere else to go
behind geoff is a circuit box
insulated cables run from the box down through the attic floor
and here comes clyde
here it comes buddy
here it clyde swings
the axe hits the circuit box behind him severing the insulated cables
as clyde rips the axe out of the wall for another try geoff reaches for one of the sparking cables
clyde raises the axe above his head
eat it ass hole
and geoff shoves the live cable into clydes mouth
sparks shoot out of clydes eyes and ears
he jerks back and forth writhing in a horrific replay of renees electrocution
then clydes face blows apart in a gout of ruined flesh and blue flame
the circuit is blown and the smoking body falls
geoff drops the cable
the blazing inferno is closing in
he runs to chase
chase is barely conscious
geoff drops to his knees and pulls his father to his feet
dont leave me again geoff
is standing in the midst of the flames reaching out
the make up and morticians wax she wears fall victim to the heat and her face begins to melt away
dont leave me alone
geoff turns away horrified
with chase on his shoulder he reaches the door
geoff sets chase against the wall
he spots the axe still clutched in clydes hand
geoff drags the axe free from the dead boys grasp and goes to work on the door
ignoring renees cries geoff swings the axe again and again chopping the door apart
he coughs through the smoke
the flames are almost upon them
finally the wood splinters apart
geoff reaches through and grasps the outside handle pulling the door open
then he turns and lifts chase up once more
at the door geoff pauses for one final tearful look back
then his face hardens and he turns away pulling chase to safety
alone in the fiery storm screaming
flames devour her flowing white dress
her face doesnt even look remotely human anymore
and as the inferno slowly closes in we
we pull out from a sign on the door that says closed
chase is just now locking up the door
hes bandaged up looking a little worse for the wear but happy to be alive
he turns grinning
stands near the van holding tiger in his arms
chase joins geoff at the van and together they climb inside
chase starts the engine pulling away from the office
as it moves off down the street passing the familiar landmarks of sleepy ludlow
we follow the van as it sweeps out of town
ludlow looks picture perfect from our birds eye vantage point
charming and quiet
so wherere we going
anywhere but here
we continue rising up into the brilliant blue sky losing the van amidst the rolling maine countryside and we rushing over the woods just above the tree tops
its an ocean of swaying green beneath us
a forest as ancient and mysterious as anything on the earth
the endless trees fall out from under us
we find ourselves above the flattop mesa of the micmac burial ground swooping downward
the ground surges towards us
we see renees open grave
the quality of light is different now
we hear the wail of the lonesome wind and perhaps the whisper of something altogether alien
and on the unsettling note we
