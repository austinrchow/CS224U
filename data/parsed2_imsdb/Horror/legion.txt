final draft come ye children listen to me
i will teach you the fear of the lord
no signs of life
a blood red sun is sinking behind the distant mountains
the unbearable heat will soon become an unbearable cold
a young womans voice
when i was a little girl my mother would remind me each night before bed to be sure to open my heart to god for he was kind merciful and
things changed after my father left a few years later leaving her to raise me and my brothers alone in a little place out on the edge of the mojave
she never talked about a kind and merciful god again
instead she spoke of a prophecy
of a time when all the world would be covered in darkness and the fate of mankind would be decided
one night i finally got up the courage to ask my mother why god had changed why was he mad at his children
i dont know she said tucking the covers around me i guess he just got tired of all the bullshit
and with these words the last trace of sunlight is snuffed out leaving us in a darkness filled with the sounds of sirens glass shattering sporadic gunfire
a city falling into chaos
title los angeles december rd a
reflected in a greasy puddle of water
might just be the smog thats making it that ominous color
then we notice something moving in the reflection
a dark shape growing coming down at us fast
land hard in the water
and were in
a dark figure in a tattered trench coat tumbles onto the pavement hands out to slow the impact
a beat then slowly he climbs to his feet recovering from what seems to have been quite a fall
he has chiseled features shaved head deep set eyes
looks like hes been through one hell of a fight
his name we will come to know is michael
he quickly checks out his surroundings nothing but brick walls above him
whered this guy jump from
a rumble of thunder
then rain starts to hammer down
seems to motivate him
michael pulls his overcoat tight around his body and dashes toward the mouth of the alley
he reaches the street just in time to see a fleet of police cars tearing around the corner sirens wailing heading this way
he reels back into the alley way ducks down behind a trash dumpster as the blue and red lights of the police cars whip past
michael waits for the lights to disappear then he pulls a massive ornate knife from his jacket
considers it grimly
runs his finger along its edge
blood beads up
michael begins to peel off his overcoat revealing his bare chest underneath
and skin literally covered with dark tatoos
hard to see what they are in this light
as his coat falls to the ground we drift over to the brick wall behind him where we see michaels shadow crouch over and then
the rain pounds harder as if punishment from the heavens
the glint of the knife coming down fast
and then silence
michael face tight with pain trench coat back on steps out of the alley stares with determination at a dark storefront across the street
a costco for survivalists
quiet except for the sound of rain then
michael drops down through one of the skylights in a shower of glass
michael bursts in
tosses a first aid kit into the sink
his trench coat falls to the floor and here in the fluorescent light we get a better look at him
his thin but stunningly well muscled body is tattooed shoulder to ankle with intricate writing
the mans flesh is a living book
but the writing is in no language we recognize
he turns his back to the mirror revealing two horrifically open wounds running down between both shoulder blades
he threads a needle not with thread but with fishing wire and begins to stitch the wounds closed
blood pools on the cement floor around his feet
trench coat and a shirt back on michael races along the endless racks of guns searching for just the right weapons his every movement precise as if hes trained his
whole life for this
weapon after ferocious weapon gets tossed into rifle bags
whatever this guys preparing for its big
rifle bags filled michael heads for the exit
the place is locked up tight
metal gate over the front doors bars over the windows
how the hells he going to get out of here
two cops world weary cruise through downtown
thats burton behind the wheel estevez riding shotgun
the police radio is abuzz with activity
burton stares out at the citys rain soaked denizens with a deep hatred the shadows looming in doorways the streetwalkers
nights like this i wish i could take a match to this city just so i could watch all these motherfuckers burn
a good ol boy barbecue huh
burton doesnt even smile
hes dead fucking serious
a fresh start
thats what this place needs
he holds his finger up like a pistol
aims it at the people they pass picking them off one by one
now burton laughs a dark mean laugh
estevez eyes his partner wary
you know burton im so happy we get to share beautiful moments like this
they really brighten my da kaboom
through the windshield we see a storefront explode just ahead raining fiery debris onto the squad car
burton slams on the breaks and the cops look up just in time to see
michael bulging rifle bags in each hand stepping brazenly out of the gaping hole hes blown in the front of the store
estevez and burton are already out of the squad car crouching behind the open doors guns trained on michael
drop the bags
hands on your head
in the distance the pop pop of gunfire
the police radio crackles with urgent chatter
many voices talking at once
the cops shift about nervously trying to stay focused
sensing their unease its starting
there isnt much time
the cops shoot a quick anxious glance at each other what the hell
then they turn back to michael
shut the fuck up and drop the bags now
michael lets the gun bags hit the ground
hands on your head
on your head
michael slowly places his palms on his skull
turn the fuck around
michael slowly turns around
estevez rushes in to restrain michael grabbing his wrist fingers tightening
michael closes his eyes a terrible decision made
and thats when he moves a fucking blur
in an instant michaels broken the cops arm spinning him helplessly around turning him into a human shield
now its michael whos in charge gun to estevezs head facing off with burton
burton struggles to find a shot cant
let em go
take the shot burton
i said let em fuckin g g g g suddenly burton starts to shake the words stuck in his throat like a skipping record
the street lamps begin to flicker and strobe adding to the confusion
burton squeezes his eyes shut in pain his whole body quaking heels clicking the pavement as if some massive pressure were building inside him
and with the horrific sound of cracking bones burtons mouth his eyes snap open focused the force inside him now fully in control
burton looks at michael with calm recognition his voice guttural
a man possessed
what are you doing michael
these werent your orders
estevez looks at his partner with confusion
what did you say
michael however seems to know exactly who hes talking to
im following my own orders now
then you will die along with the child
burton you fuckin know this guy
burton shoots his partner in the head
estevez drops leaving michael without cover
burton re aims but michaels faster already firing back
bullets rip up the concrete
the squad car window shatters burtons chest exploding
and down he goes leaving michael the only one left standing
smoke rising from his gun
with soldier like efficiency michael picks up the rifle bags and begins to load them into the trunk of the squad car
he gets in the car and floors it roaring away as the flickering street lamps finally go out in rapid succession a wave chasing him plunging the entire city into
covered with sweat
jeep switches on a lamp illuminating this incredibly cramped bedroom
not much larger than the bed itself
hes got shaggy hair a sensitive face clearly not big on sunlight
a couple of ancient silverstream trailers are bathed in the eerie blue light of nights final moments
it looks like the trailers havent moved from this patch of barren ground in decades
a single strand of colored christmas lights dot the trailers roof lines marking the season
one of the trailer doors creaks open and jeep steps wearily out into the cool western morning
nothing but desert for miles in all directions save for a two lane highway and a weather beaten truck stop diner that jeep and his father will open for business
in a few hours
jeep gazes up to the diners slanted roof where a large sign glows like a beacon in the darkness a beat as jeep contemplates the sign
you okay jeep
jeep turns to see charlie a very pregnant girl of about twenty standing in the trailer doorway rubbing the sleep from her eyes
even with the trailer trash veneer shes strikingly beautiful
sorry to wake you charlie
stepping out of the trailer hands on her wasnt you
hes been kickin up a storm all night
must know somethin i dont
she approaches jeep
sees the strain in his eyes
another bad dream
he struggles for a moment nods
its just stress jeep thats all
you do too much worryin
about this place
about your dad
a glimmer of a smile crosses jeeps face
youre the only thing i like worrying about
see what i mean
youre worried about a girl eight months pregnant and it isnt even your baby
now thats enough to give anybody nightmares
jeep turns away dejected
go ahead make fun of me
everybody else does
turns him back around cmon i was only kiddin
you know how much i appreciate everything you and bob are doing for me but a month from now this babyll have a new family and ill have to start
thinkin about what the hell im doin with my life
this is not news jeep wants to hear
so youre still going through with it
jeep im not ready to be a mama
christ i can barely take care of myself as it is
i could help you
we could do it together you know
i want to
charlie smiles sadly at him touched by his sweetness but this just isnt where shes at
you gotta stop carryin the weight of the world on your shoulders
jeep nods tries to hide the fact that hes dying inside
rubbing her arms now can we go back in
im freezing my ass off out here
ill be right there
charlie kisses him on the cheek and heads back to the trailer
he watches her longing in his eyes
with the clank of the door shes gone
and over jeeps troubled look the perennial holiday cheer of frank capras its a wonderful life mixes up
i dont know whether i like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings
jimmy stewart as george bailey has just met clarence his guardian angel in training
the signal rolls and snows in and out
we hear a whack which causes the image to momentarily improve and then slowly roll back the other way
oh ive got to earn them and youll help me wont you
bob hansen late s owner and proprietor of this fine roadside establishment attempts to fix the old tv hanging in the corner above the counter by banging the shit out
the restaurant itself has the kind of grungy diner charm youd hope to find in a place last renovated in
an old plastic christmas tree strung with flickering lights and tinsel occupies a lonely corner
next to that a faded diorama of the nativity scene
the kind you might order off the shopping network
bob considers the tv with a frown
he deftly rolls an engraved silver zippo back and forth over the nicotine stained fingers of his right hand
must be a nervous habit
you can tell just by looking at the man that hes a beer drinker
behind the counter a black man named percy walker s is cooking up a storm on the grill with spectacular one handed dexterity
you do get pretty good at this sort of thing when your other hand has long been replaced by a metal hook
the dog tags around his neck tell the story
his white cooks hat has been temporarily replaced by a red santa hat
lord as my witness bob one of these days that things gonna hit you back
whaddya talkin about percy
we got a special relationship here
yeah they got names for that kind a relationship
the jukebox on the other side of the diner starts up with the merle haggard tune im a lonesome fugitive
a stunning looking sixteen year old girl with dyed black hair and a piercing or three is leaning seductively over the jukebox swaying gently to the music
the headband doubling as her mini skirt reveals her knock out figure in a way that really doesnt leave much up to the imagination
shes a billboard of rebellion
it is disgusting
watching the scintillating action from a booth across the diner is a conservatively dressed suburban couple
sandra and howard anderson
fish out of water
really how can she go out in public wearing that
i dont know
why dont we just ask her
youll embarrass me
shouting across the audrey honey
your mother was wondering if you got dressed this morning with the specific intention of showing your ass off to the entire world
the girl who we now know as audrey anderson turns to howard with a caustic smile
yeah thats cuz i woke up hoping to get double teamed by a couple of meth head truckers in the bathroom of some desert shithole
good thing we stopped here
and with that she turns back to the jukebox
percy watches the exchange discreetly from behind the counter
howard turns back to his wife
i feel satisfied with that answer
i really do
sandra buries her face in her hands
im being punished for something i know it
across the diner audrey goes back to swaying dreamily to the music which is suddenly overtaken by bass bumpin hip hop
the noontime sun bakes the strip of highway slicing through this barren country
a black cadillac escalade blazes a path
heavy beats thunder from within
the stereo in this rig could shake mountains
kyle williams late s handsome as hell thug style
a straight up bad boy
he passes a weathered road sign kyles expression says this is not good news
he grabs his cell phone off the passenger seat
he spots the truck stop diner just up the road ahead
the escalade pulls off the highway and rolls to a stop at the lonely row of old gas pumps
kyle gets out and surveys the scenery with dismay
now in the daytime we see this is truly a place time forgot
attached to the diner is a mechanics bay
grease stains and rusty car parts litter the ground
behind the place is the silverstream trailer we saw jeep step out of earlier
the only thing here that looks fairly new is the uhaul truck parked in front of the garage with its hood up
kyle grabs a crumpled hand drawn map from the front seat and flattens it out on the roof of the car
he spins it around
which way is north
darren your fuckin directions suck man
he checks his cell phone again
no chance of a signal way out here
so he shuffles around to the side of the diner in search of a pay phone
the good news is that he finds one
the bad news is that its been broken for ten years
leaning next to the broken phone however is charlie wearing a shabby faded waitress uniform stretched tight around her very pregnant belly
adding to her perfect mother to be look is that cigarette dangling from her lips
the plastic name tag pinned to her chest says charlie
she eyes him mildly intrigued takes a drag
you know that shit right there aint good for the baby
she lets out a long slow exhale
guess i should think bout quittin then
now hold on girl let me bum one before you do
you can buy a whole pack inside
tell ya what
you let me have one of yours and ill give you two from the new pack youre gonna sell me
she considers him for a moment then pulls out a cigarette
lights it off the end of hers then hands it to him
kyle takes a drag pulls out his crumpled map
am i in the right place
peers at the map only if nowheres right cause thats where you are
there another phone around here
you know one that works
bobll probably let you use the diner phone if you ask him real nice
and pay im somethin
i can handle that
you got pancakes here
yeah we got a buttermilk stack for three seventy five
we also got french toast for four dollars if youre into that
i personally like the pancakes though
you okay charlie
they both turn to see jeep behind the diner wearing mechanics coveralls and holding a dusty old crib
charlie quickly hides her cigarette behind her back
yeah im okay
this guys just lost
jeep nods uncertain eyes kyle another moment then he shuffles along out of sight
charlie brings the cigarette back up to her lips
an awkward beat
three seventy five huh
the door jingles
charlie and kyle enter
audreys eyes light up when she sees kyle
he notices her as well
how couldnt he
shes directing every ounce of sex appeal she has in his direction
her parents on the other hand shoot a look of utter fear in kyles direction as if he personified their worst suburban nightmare
charlie heads to the register
digs out a fresh pack of smokes from underneath the counter
i hope salem lights are okay cause thats all we got left
if i can smoke em ill take em
where ya been charlie
bob steps off the chair
this aint a resort you know
i got orders stacking up here
in truth there arent any orders stacking up but it certainly makes bob feel better to say it
sees the two cigarettes kyles handing her you best not be smokin again
not in your condition
gestures to the diner bob do you see where am i right now
can my condition really get any worse
sides you aint one to talk
i quit two years ago
yeah so why you still carryin that fancy lighter round for
it was a gift from my ex wife alright
i dont wanna forget how much i hate her guts
bob turns to kyle
doesnt like what he sees
can i use your phone
my cell doesnt get a signal out here and the pay phone outside is busted
bob is about to respond when
howard approaches oblivious to the conversation hes interrupting
any news about when our truck might be fixed
you said your boy would have us on the road two hours ago
the rate were going well be lucky to make it to scottsdale by christmas
bobs expression darkens at this news
where the hell is jeep
a cloth wipes away the dirt revealing the partial image of an angel carved into the surface
jeep is carefully cleaning the old wooden crib on a workbench
theres an unsettling intensity in his eyes as if fear itself were driving him
jeep freezes knows hes in trouble he reluctantly turns to see his father standing next to the andersons broken down uhual
the fact that this trucks hoods up mean anything to you
jeep stares at the ground
couldnt be anymore uncomfortable
approaches peering past him to the crib
bob contd whaddya workin on thats so goddamn important youre not doin your job
jeep tries feebly to block his path fails
bob looks down at the crib with dismay
found it under a bunch of stuff in the storage shed
i know you never like to throw anything away
bob considers him softens
jeep i like charlie
and i think its real good of you to lend her a helping hand but she is not your responsibility
heard this before pushes past him oh whatever leave me alone
dont walk away from me while im talkin to you
jeep walks out toward the gas pumps but bobs right alongside him not giving up
how long you gonna follow her around like a puppy dog
cleanin up the messes she makes while she steps out with every guy around here other than you
turns to his father dont say that about her
shes not like that
bob gives jeep a hard stare
yeah she is
you really think shes gonna stick around here after that babys born and off her hands
jeeps shakes his head burns
look i know it doesnt make any sense to you but its just something i have to do
bob sighs feels for his boy
points up at the paradise falls sign see that up there
your mother thought i was crazy for wanting to buy this place middle of nowhere
but i just knew this was what i was supposed to do
told your mom just wait
told her when they finally ran the freeway through here like they were plannin on this place would be like grand central station
but i was wrong
the freeway never came and now the only people who ever stop here are the ones who are lost
and your mom
well she got tired of waitin
you cant blame yourself for what she did yeah i can
and im sayin youre about to make the same damn mistake i made believing in something thats never gonna happen
its time for you to move on from this place jeep
i dont wanna see you wake up one morning old and pissed off realizing youre lost just like everybody else who stops here
jeep looks up at his father his words hanging heavily
a tough pill to swallow
now get to work on that truck
i wanna have these people on the road by nightfall
bob walks back into the diner
jeep is about to turn back to the garage when he notices something off in the distance
ominous dark clouds line the horizon to the south like a living wall
he shifts his gaze up the highway to the north
dark clouds are pushing their way over the distant mountains
a storm is coming
bob reenters the diner to find kyle sitting at the counter digging into a plate of banana pancakes
kyle is about to address him again when something else steals bobs attention
holding up a silencing yeah wait a minute
the tv has gone on the fritz again
only now the image is mostly snow
bob climbs back onto the chair
faces the tv
whats wrong with you today
the image flickers but doesnt improve
i told you to get the satellite tv
but you dont wanna listen
what the hell do i need that crap for
history channel man
i got all the history i can take
thats for sure
whats your problem now
where do i start
you know this was the top of the line model when i bought it
yeah in the fifties
you shouldnt be watchin anyways
rubs his hands together okay baby this is gonna do it
bob gives the tv one final wallop whack
and the picture snaps into focus
only it isnt the picture he was expecting
the stark graphic of the emergency broadcasting system and its accompanying hollow tone fill the diner
everybody in the place stops and turns to the tv
clear as day
nice work bob
what the hells that
its just one of those test things
thatd be true except for the words at the bottom of the screen which read bob switches the channels
all the same
dont look like a test
bob steps off the chair and backs slowly away from the tv as if a little distance will bring some clarity
he bumps into kyle
yo am i the invisible motherfuckin man here
do you have a phone or not
kyle peels a five dollar bill off a serious wad of cash
that gets bobs attention
bob snaps the money out of his hand
in the back past the kitchen
make it fast
kyle hustles passed percy
charlie is standing by the andersons table clearing dishes
everybodys eyes are locked on the tv
if theres a real emergency arent they supposed to give us some information about what to do
im sure its a mistake
hey percy give that old radio of yours a shot
maybe they got some news about the tv
percy grabs an old battery powered radio off a kitchen shelf
switches it on
he spins the dial until he reaches a clear signal
the same hollow tone of emergency broadcasting
station after station the same thing
the diner is overwhelmed by a chilling chorus of hollow tones
everyone goes very still
let me talk to him
kyle sits at a messy desk in this dark wood paneled back office phone to his ear
on phone cuz a father should be able to talk to his son thats why
now put im on the phone
a beat then a smile is that my little man
yeah well im working hard so that i can be with you
you bein good
strange static can be wait
youre breakin up
hangs up in frustration shit
kyle stews a beat then picks up the phone to redial
no dial tone
what the hell
he keeps trying
maybe there was an earthquake
everyone is looking at howard
they keep sayin were overdue for a big one
lot a folks could be hurt
not if it was centered in the desert
could be nothing to worry about
so then whys the tv out
maybe it just hit the relay stations
arent those usually in remote areas
yeah cause of the radiation they give off
there aint no radiation comin from those things
plus that dont explain the radio being out too
some of those stations broadcast over hundreds of miles
any quake that big and we would a felt it
i didnt feel nothing
maybe its a terrorist attack or something
covers her mouth oh god
everyone considers that grimly then well for cryin out loud
theres no use in speculating
ill just call my brother up in needles
he must a heard something
i dont think so
kyle has reappeared in the diner
whaddya talkin about
just tried to make a call
youre shittin me
kyle shakes his head sits down at the counter
oh this is just great
nothing to get excited about
probably just working on the lines
bob contd sides im sure jeepll have your truck fixed up quick as can be and then youll be on your way
jeep is buried under the uhauls hood working at something with a socket wrench
its not going well
he pulls himself up
grease covers his face and hands
the sound of a car approaching catches his attention
he watches as a beat up eighties cutlass supreme pulls off the highway and rolls to a stop at the pumps
its a mystery how anyone could see through the layer of dust on that windshield
after a moment the car door pops open and the legs of an elderly woman swing down to the ground followed by the metal frame and wheels of a walker
the little old lady gets out of the car steadies herself on the walker and then slowly makes her way toward the diner with the rickety frailness of an old
jeep watches her disappear inside
he then looks toward the horizon again
the wall of dark clouds are growing ever closer
a jingle as the old lady enters
she surveys the scene as if feasting on paradise
maybe her eyes arent so good
have a seat wherever you want maam
specials are on the board
thank you dear
the old lady settles at a table across from the andersons
she smiles at them pleasantly
charlie is about to hand her a menu when oh i already know what i want
okay whatll it be
ill have the steak please
and howd you like that cooked
rare if you would
and water no ice
coming right up
charlie is it
what an unusual name for a girl
so they say
ill be right back with your water
the old lady turns to the andersons
hello im gladys
nice to meet you gladys
im sandra and this is my husband howard
what a nice young couple you are
what brings you out to these parts
were moving out to scottsdale
but our truck broke down and so were stuck here while its being fixed
oh what a nuisance
a fly begins to buzz around gladyss head
she doesnt seem to notice it
say gladys it seems the lines are down around here
the phone and tv you know
sandra contd and i just was wondering if you might have heard something on your way up
you know about whats going on
gladys smiles strangely
oh dont worry yourself about that sweetheart
itll all be over soon
sandra nods at the old woman unsure of what to make of that response
the fly that was circling her head now lands on gladyss face
it crawls across her cheek without her reacting in the least
howard and sandra exchange looks
the door jingles and jeep walks in
he heads straight for a quiet huddle with bob
all the while though he keeps one eye fixed on the old lady sitting at the table near the andersons
something about her
the carburetors shot
dont know why
looks brand new
glances over at the ah shit
theyre gonna be pissed
i could try to rebuild it but itd take a while and i dont think we have all the parts
if we call right now we might be able to get a new one down here tomorrow morning
thats not gonna happen
goddamn phones out
across the diner charlie places a bloody red steak in front of gladys
thank you dear
how far along are you
charlie rests a hand on her belly
just about there
the father must be very proud
i wouldnt know
you mean hes
out of sight
out of mind
oh i see
so youre not married i take it
a fly lands on gladyss steak
charlie tries to wave it away
but another one lands in its place
gladys starts to dig in to the steak with a real ferociousness you wouldnt expect from an old lady
more flies begin to land on her body
on her food
charlie is still trying to wave them away
thats too bad
no i prefer it that way
i dont a need a man tellin me what to do
but what about the baby
ive got it under control
yeah but its gonna burn
the andersons turn to look as well
kyle glances over from the counter
what did you just say
all smiles i said your fucking babys gonna burn
charlie shakes her head at the woman not giving in
go to hell lady
she slaps the check down on the table and walks back toward the kitchen passing jeep and bob
total fucking jesus freak
gladys begins to laugh innocently as she continues to devour her meat
red juice drips down her chin
the flies are swarming now
how did so many get in here
sandra and howard are mortified at this sudden turn of events
all those babies
theyre gonna burn
theres no reason to gladyss head suddenly whips toward her
shut up you stupid fucking cunt
all you do is complain
sandra covers her mouth in shock
everybody in the diner is now focused on the old lady
howard gets up from the booth
howard its okay
dont listen to her
but howards already standing over gladys
who the hell do you think you are lady
now id like you to apologize to my
everybody freaks as howard crumbles to the floor
gladys rockets to her feet knocking her table over
blood covers her face and chest
youre all going to fucking die
percy is the first to react
from behind the counter he whips a heavy metal frying pan at gladys that knocks her head sideways
bones break and burst from her neck
impossibly gladys is still standing
she lets out an inhuman scream and scrambles across the diner knocking tables and chairs over in her wake
bob pulls a shotgun from behind the counter
but gladys not only moves she scurries right up the fucking bob cant believe his eyes
but he gets over it real fast as the crab lady rushes toward him across the ceiling bob pumps the shotgun trying to take her down but he cant track
her fast enough
instead he blows enormous holes in the ceiling a rain of plaster
gladys drops down right in front of bob
struggles to cock the fuck
gladys smiles sweetly before slapping him clear across the the shotgun clatters to the floor at jeeps feet
he snatches it up and aims it at gladys who turns calmly to face him
shoot her jeep
jeeps about to fire when the old ladys eyes go all white
a sickly sweet smile youll never save her
jeep freezes stunned by her words overwhelming fear paralyzing him where he stands
gladys rockets straight at him
but jeeps too afraid to move
he clamps his eyes shut bracing himself for the end
a rain of bullets rip into gladys taking her down like an animal
jeep slowly opens his eyes
his guns still cocked
gladys lies dead in a smoldering bloody heap at his feet
he turns to see kyle with smoke rising from the barrel of his silver plated western arms
if everyone wasnt so shocked theyd probably be wondering why this guy is packing such serious heat
somebody help me
sandra is on the floor with her husband
blood pours freely from his neck
kyle stares at the dying man a moment of hesitation then he rushes to help
press your hands over the hole
sandra looks fearfully up at kyle at the gun still in his hand
dont look at me like that lady
im tryin to fuckin help you
now put your goddamn hands over the hole before your husband bleeds to death
obeying she cups her hands over the hole in his neck desperately trying to stop the flow of blood leaking out between her fingers
percy scrambles over with a first aid kit and together he and kyle get to work on howards neck
a few feet away charlie helps bob bruised and bleeding to his feet
the fuck was that
what the fuck was that
across the diner audrey is pushed back into a booth her knees pulled tightly to her chest shivering
her adult facade giving way to that of a frightened child a drop of red hits audreys cheek causing her to look up and see gladyss trail of blood dripping
from the ceiling
an ungodly horror
kyle percy sandra and audrey frantically carry howard his neck bandaged to the back of the escalade
howard lies in the back seat
sandra by his head clasping his hands in hers
audrey by his feet
percy rides shotgun
kyle struggles to get the key in the ignition
the engine roars to life
the escalade fishtails onto the highway
kyle grips the wheel
picking up speed
how far to the hospital
seventy maybe eighty miles
kyle shoots him a look
pedal to the floor time
audrey leans forward from the back seat
whats that on the road
up ahead the dark clouds jeep saw earlier have finally closed in descending onto the highway like a wall
theyre fuckin clouds
what the fuck do they look like
clouds dont buzz
suddenly hundreds of tiny bugs begin to hit the windshield and thats when they realize it
those arent clouds
the escalade enters the swarm
the car is pummeled by insects the windshield instantly covered in black and red bug guts
the sound of flies splattering and buzzing is deafening
everyone screams as hell surrounds them
bob is hunched over the steaming sink pounding a can of light beer
jeep is leaning against the wall looking like hes about to puke or faint
i dont understand how she was still standin after percy hit er with that goddamn fryin pan
broke her fuckin neck
i saw it
i swear i did
and did you see that kids gun
the hells he doin with a gun like that
bob looks over at jeep sees him trembling
its okay jeep
but for jeep its not okay
hes hurting real bad inside
i couldnt pull the trigger
i saw what i needed to do but i was afraid
breaks down she couldve killed you
jeep contd or charlie
she wouldve killed me if it wasnt for
he cant get the words out
bob rests a hand on his boys shoulder
theres nothin to be ashamed of jeep
not everybody can play the hero
before jeep can respond they hear the sound of the front bob and jeep appear from the back as kyle percy audrey and sandra carry howard into the diner all
of them stumbling gasping for air
charlie moves in to help
percy races for the back
catching percy by the where you going
to get my bible
the hell you need that for
well somebodys gotta start prayin
bobs about to respond when he hears the buzzing
bob charlie and jeep slowly approach the windows to see the everything in the diner is suddenly cast in dark red as the days remaining sunlight filters through the swarm
no one breathes
revealing a bloody mess of muscles and tendons chewed down to the bone
percy and charlie are tending to howard
sandra is holding her husbands hand trying to comfort him while audrey watches from a distance with grim fascination
raises a bottle of okay hold em steady
nods peakish to oh god please dont throw up
howard writhes as percy pours alcohol on the wound
sandra cant help but stare at percys hook
meanwhile across the diner bob and jeep peel back the tablecloth to examine gladys bullet riddled corpse
kyle stands over them with bobs shotgun trained on the body just in case
gladys is a real horror show
bones jut out at obtuse angles from her neck a result of the blow to her head from percys frying pan
shes cold as a freakin ice cube
if i hadnt just seen her walk in here id say the old bags been dead for hours
bob rolls gladys over revealing her face her enlarged mouth filled with dozens of razor sharp baby teeth
well i dont care how long shes been dead the bitch aint stayin in here with us
bob kyle and jeep quickly drag gladyss body wrapped in the plastic table cloth a short ways from the diner
they warily eye the curtain of flies no more than a hundred yards out
i dont get it
why dont they come closer
how the fuck am i supposed to know man
you askin me to explain the behavior of a motherfuckin pestilence
a clank and jeep notices the old ladys car keys have dropped to the ground
holding up the keys you guys
its windows are completely caked with dust
the men wipe away a layer of brown from the glass allowing them to peer inside the car
you see anything
no twilight zone shit if thats what you mean
jeep slips the key into the drivers side door
old lady could have some kind of rabid poodle locked up in there
jeep slowly swings the door open and thats when the smell hits them
what the fuck is that
bob covers his nose
kyle opens the passenger door looks in
but nothing unusual
how bout the trunk
they go around to the back of the car
jeep slips the key in
the trunk pops open revealing a pile of dead cats
bob quickly slams the trunk closed
the guys are reeling with disgust
kyles trying to blow the stench from his nose
bitchs got motherfuckin dead cats in her hoopty
what the fuck is wrong with white people
least now we know where that smell was coming from
yeah it was a real motherfuckin necessity we figured that out man
sees something up the hey
they turn to see headlights growing larger in the dim haze
a police cruiser careens off the highway and skids to a wild stop in front of the diner
its engine rattles as the dust clears around it
no movement can be seen behind its bug splattered windows
okay now were talkin
wait a minute
check it out
whats an la cop doing way out here
bob and jeep look over at kyle
im from nevada man
they consider the police car a moment more
see the shattered passenger window the blood stains
give me the shotgun
kyle hands the shotgun over to bob
charlies face lights up when she sees the police car
oh thank god the police
the door of the police car opens as charlie races from the diner
the three men see her moving toward the car
jeeps face goes slack
the men begin to run toward her
while out of the police car steps
charlie freezes a few feet from the car when she sees those piercing eyes already familiar to us
michael looks at her as if she was exactly who he expected to see
in moments bob kyle and jeep form a protective shield in front of charlie
bob raises the shotgun
take one step closer and ill drop you right here
a long beat as michael considers bob
that how you greet all your customers
mister after what weve been through here today youre lucky we didnt shoot you first and greet you later
now let me see your teeth
michael stares at him blankly
your teeth goddamn it
lemme see em
michael offers up a dangerous smile revealing a not so well kept but definitely normal set of teeth
bob and the others ease slightly
no shark teeth pop
bob lowers the gun
suppose you tell us your name then
sorry about all that michael
this old lady just went crazy inside my place here
she had these teeth
never seen anything like em
practically bit a man in half
michael remains silent
doesnt seemed shocked in the least by what hes heard
so what are you doin out here
gotta say you dont exactly look like a police officer
even one from l
then again you have to be right
i mean who the helld be crazy enough to steal a cop car
bob chuckles for a moment
when michael doesnt respond in kind bob falls silent
he slowly raises the shotgun again
michael sizes up this raggedy group
his gaze drifts over to the loosely wrapped body in front of the diner
the plastic table cloth flaps wildly in the wind
turning back to bob you dont know do you
we dont know anything
nothings working here
the tv the radio the phone
michael just shakes his head
im running out of time
michael steps toward charlie with a sense of purpose but bob blocks his path brandishing the shotgun
back off fella
now i dont care if this is the second coming of jesus fucking christ i say its time for you to either get talkin or get the hell outta here
in a blur of movement michael rips the shotgun from bobs hands
it all happens so fast that bob is stunned to find himself holding air
hes even more stunned to now have the barrel of the gun pressed to the bridge of his nose
michaels expression is totally calm
cmon dad tell em youre sorry
tell em you were only kidding
but bob cant even speak hes so scared
he squeezes his eyes closed
let em go
michaels eyes flit momentarily in charlies direction
the diner door opens and percy steps cautiously out with hand and hook held up to show no threat
hes followed by sandra and audrey
michael sees them but offers no indication that he cares
now son im sure you dont wanna go spillin blood for no good reason in front of all these decent people do ya
our friend bob here aint worth the trouble itd cause ya
so whaddya say bout just lettin im go and then you can be on your way
nice n easy
but michael doesnt seem to register this plea
its not looking good
no one breathes
thats when kyle notices something out in the direction of the road
michael turns sees the lights
michael whips the gun away from bobs head and thrusts it back into his hands
bobs looks down at the gun speechless
youre going to need this
michael walks swiftly around to the trunk of the cruiser
pops it revealing a staggering arsenal of weaponry
percy stares out at the lights eyes wide
lord have mercy
waving back audrey and you ladies best get back inside
what is it
who is this man
whys he driving a police car
shut up mom
audrey pulls her mother back into the diner
michael hands an mp sub machine gun to kyle
another one goes to percy
finally he places a third one in jeeps hands who stares down at it anxiously
i dont think thats such a good idea
dad i can handle it
to michael hes just a kid i said i can handle it
michaels eyes narrow studying jeep
he can handle it
he doesnt have a choice
michael pulls out twin mp s for himself
glock s are tucked everywhere they can go
michael tosses clip belts to the men
boxes of shotgun shells
if you want to live youll do exactly as i say
he slams the trunk closed and approaches charlie
he cocks a glock and hands it to her
when you fire you keep your thumb off the slide
dont do anything brave
theres no safety
he gives her a hard look
she nods nervously
trusting him but not sure why
michael marches into the diner
kyle glances quickly at the others then he bolts after michael
now its only jeep and his father left
we gotta go
and bob rushes into the diner
a moment as jeep looks out toward the road
he contemplates the sub machine gun in his hands
and races after his father
locking the diner door
kyle and michael push a booth in front of the door sealing off the entrance
tables are turned on their sides to form makeshift shields
window blinds are snap closed
jeep races in locks the back door
then he pushes a desk in front of it
the place is transformed
locked up tight
the roar of engines outside grows ever louder closer
sandra huddles on the floor with howard his head in her lap
shes running her hands gently through his hair trying to keep calm
he opens his eyes
pale weak from blood loss
sandra closes her eyes
struggling to believe it
suddenly the electricity goes out dipping the room into
we hear cries of alarm
jeep get the flashlights
everybody just stay still
now that were locked in here what the fuck are we supposed to do
a flicker of light
and then flashlight beams cut through the darkness
coming to rest on michaels pale face
michael looks up at the ceiling
a hatch opens and out comes michael followed by bob percy and kyle
they quickly take their places behind the paradise sign
pitch black surrounds them
the rumble of engines is gone leaving only the rush of the wind coming up off the desert
where the hell did they go
bob turns to michael sharply
you got us up here
now you mind explaining what the fuck were fighting
michael is about to answer when listen
over the wind another sound becomes audible
the delicate chime of a calliope
you hear what im hearing
the hell is that
the calliope music grows louder the melody more distinct
now we recognize the song santa claus is coming to town
but instead of filling them with cheer it fills them with dread
it sounds almost like
two headlights appear in the darkness
and sure enough an ice cream truck rolls slowly toward the diner
the eerie calliope music emanates from a speaker on its roof
its too dark to see whos behind the wheel
youve got to be fuckin kidding me
theres a safety switch on the side of your gun
push it all the way down
the men quickly do as theyre told
now when this starts you hold on tight you hear me
if you dont youre going to blow your hand off
kyle bob shoot quick anxious looks at percy
the fuck yall lookin at me for
jeep faces the boarded up front door awkwardly holding the mp trying to assume a tough guy posture
if only he could stop shaking it might be believable
charlie and audrey peer between the slats covering the windows
the ice cream trucks headlights fan across the diner
audrey and charlie back away from the windows
charlie stops next to jeep
senses him shaking
rests a hand on his arm
and that seems to help
howard smiles weakly at the familiar sound of the calliope
oh honey listen
its the ice cream man
the ice cream truck pulls to a stop with its headlights facing the diner
everyone aims their guns at the truck
from the ice cream truck
a dark bloody shoe steps to the ground
moving up the long grey pant leg spotted with blood stains to reveal a skeletally thin man in tattered coveralls
say hello to the ice cream man
he looks like hes been through hell literally
as he steps into the beams of the headlights we can see him even more clearly
his clothes dont seem to fit him
and hes unnaturally thin as if hes been stretched like taffy
if he got down on all fours you might mistake him for some kind of spider
he surveys the diner the garage the roof assessing the situation
on the roof the men wait for something to happen
ah he dont look that bad
the ice cream mans gaze snaps up to the roof
thats when the ice cream mans jaw unhinges stretching after row of a razor sharp teeth form with the sickening sound of cracking of bones
from his new mouth the ice cream man lets out an earth shattering howl
everyone except michael is practically hyperventilating with fear
and the ice cream man bolts for the diner with startling speed
his movements arent at all like those of a normal man but rather like some kind of human insect
bullets rip into the creatures body knocking him flat on his back
arms and legs in a twisted twitching mess
michael keeps his aim
the calliope music continues to play
is that it
not even close
a rumbling of engines
a freeway full of vehicles of every variety punch through the wall of dust racing toward the diner
they are the now
the men let loose with ferocious firepower
vehicles swerve and collide
dark shapes bolt from the burning vehicles scattering
in the flash of battle we catch glimpses of them business football team
all deformed by some demonic force
many mere balls of flame drifting through the darkness
dont let them get close to the windows
the dark shapes converge on the diner from all directions
they move so strangely fast it seems that their feet dont actually touch the ground
from the roof its a full on turkey shoot as the men follow michaels instructions and cut down everything in sight
their faces lighting up with each flash
shell casings spray from their weapons like water drops from a sprinkler
bodies burst and crumble to the dirt
the creatures dont seem to be afraid of dying
their strategy appears to be in their sheer numbers
with each wave the dark figures get ever closer to the diner
on bob firing madly
hes out of ammo
percy tosses him a box of shells
but bob fumbles the catch and the box slides halfway down the sloped roof
with the gun still in one hand bob reaches frantically down for the ammo
below the roofline
her hair must have been in curlers before most of it burned away
her nightdress hangs in tatters off her body
her jaw clicks rapidly as she clatters up at bob like a giant insect
bob tries to pull back but he has no traction and he starts to slip down toward her
shes coming fast
percy sees his friend in trouble
bob swings the shotgun like a club crack
knocking the bitch clear off the roof
but the move has made his slide even faster
he drops the shotgun trying to hold on but he cant stop
she doesnt even have a chance to react as bob does something akin to a swimmers push right off her body
the creature goes flying back off the roof and the opposing force halts bobs slide
extending his hook grab my hand
bob reaches up and clasps percys hook praying that it stays on
but this chick aint finished yet
up she comes once more
her razor sharp fingernails claw up the metal roof
percy tosses bob a glock
fortunately this time bob deftly catches it with his free hand just as the deranged woman pounces on him
jamming the gun in her fuck off
the back of her head explodes
her body goes limp
bob struggles to push the corpse off of him
pull me up
percy extends his hook hand helping bob ascend to safety
hiding in the shadows
listening to sounds of war just outside
sandra squeezes her hands over her ears
a few feet away audrey clutches a butchers knife
jeeps eyes darting from one window to another
trying to keep it together
charlie is crouched down behind the counter holding the handgun close to her pregnant belly
distant explosions rattle the plates on the shelves
charlie peers out from behind the counter to look at the front windows
momentary flashes of intense light outline the closed blinds
another flash lights up charlies face
percy is swivelling left and right firing like mad
come on motherfuckers
closer and closer the creatures come
most are eviscerated by the fire from the rooftop
on charlie staring at the window
charlies eyes go wide as smash
a dark shape crashes through the window
glass sand and dust swirl in
audrey and sandra scream
charlie springs up from her hiding place gun ready
jeep spins around pointing his gun searching frantically for the intruder
its so dark
where is it
audrey shakes her head tears streaming down her cheeks
she looks over at her mother
sandras eyes are closed
its too much
open your eyes
suddenly howards body is torn away from sandra
somethings got hold of his legs
that gets sandras eyes open
springing after her howard
howard screams deliriously as hes dragged rapidly through the diner toward the broken front window
he flails about desperately trying to grab a hold of something
sandra scrambles after her husband
reaching for him
the creature reaches the window
sandra dives for howards outstretched hands
she has him
the creatures progress is abruptly halted at the shattered window
it turns back toward sandra a shaft of light falling across its face reveals a teenage girl of about audreys age
her skin is a deathly blue
her pupils a ghastly white
deep human fingernail scratches have torn open the bloated flesh on her arms neck and face
the self inflicted wounds of a drug addict
her voice is not quite human
see what you made me do mother
sandra screams holds on
charlie and audrey rush to sandras side grabbing howards arms
jeep is right behind them ready to fire at the creature but with the women in the way he cant get a clear shot
so he discards the gun and grabs howards arms
howard screams as his body is torturously stretched
a human tug of war
howards body lurches further out the window
howards torso is almost entirely out the window
charlie daringly reaches for howards belt desperate to gain leverage
charlie screams as shes yanked painfully toward the window losing her grip on howards belt
through the broken window she sees the face of a raggedy looking man
he smiles at her like a father coming home to his baby girl
there you are
and he starts to pull her arm even harder
other creatures suddenly notice her as well focusing their attack as if she alone was their target
jeep immediately lets go of howard and dives for charlie grabbing her free arm just before shes pulled through
without the help audrey and sandra cant hold on any longer
howard is ripped from of his familys hands and out the window
the tide is turning
the men seem to have gotten their game on and the dark shapes are starting to pull back
we got em
kyle turns happily to michael
kyle looks around the roof with alarm
only a few more inches separate charlie and certain death through the window
jeeps losing her
charlie and jeep fall back into the diner the claw like hands still grasping charlies arm no longer attached to their owners
michael leaps over her a butchers knife in one hand a machine gun in the other
he lights up everything in his path
the window blinds become a wall of fire
creatures screech and flee into the night having successfully taken their first victim
charlie flings the severed appendages off her and she and jeep scoot away from the window
hysterical sandra tries to push past michael
shes going after howard
he intercepts her before she can make it out
let me go
sandra slaps at him frantically as he carries her away from the window and thrusts her down into a back booth
sandra breaks down
as charlie climbs slowly to her feet a sudden pain
she clutches her belly
jeep catches her arm to steady her
she glances back at michael
hes watching her
i told you not to do anything brave
charlie doesnt know how to respond
shes about to say something when kyle rushes into the room
a smile on his face
we got em runnin
then kyle notices the broken window takes in the room his excitement falling
no one responds
sandra and audrey are huddled together
bob and percy follow kyle in still shaking from the adrenaline
someone needs to be on the roof
bob grabs kyles arm
approaches michael you better start talking
all eyes on michael
these people want answers
the first time god lost faith in man he sent a flood
the second time
he sent what you see outside
everyone takes that in for a moment then you sayin this is the apocalypse
im saying this is an extermination
those things out there are vessels
the weakest willed are the easiest to turn
possessed by what
that silences the room
pulls out his bible son i dont know what bible you been readin but in my version the angels are the good guys
michael looks squarely at percy
thats where your book is wrong
how come you know so much about them
i know because until last night i was on their side
you mean youre
michael considers jeep then not anymore
right and yesterday i was the fuckin easter bunny
you know fuck this
i dont even believe in god
thats fine because he doesnt believe in you either
bob stares at michael uncertain how to respond to that
have you looked outside recently
those arent exactly our regular customers out there
how do we know he didnt bring them here himself
he brings them here and then he saves us from them
youre a genius bob
bob falls silent confounded
audrey hesitantly approaches michael
so youre here to protect us
looks at charlie her
charlie reacts in shock as all eyes are suddenly on her
because your child is the only hope humanity has of surviving
in response to that charlie does the only thing someone can do when told such a thing
but michael isnt joking and charlies laughter becomes genuine fear
jeep stares at charlie as if suddenly his entire life is starting to make sense
youre sayin shes the mother of the messiah
wait a minute isnt mary supposed to be a vi go fuck yourself bob
makes you wonder about mary
approaches michael panic setting in look this is not possible
im just a waitress
i cant give birth to the savior of mankind
and finally i dont even own a car
none of that matters anymore
either your child lives or mankind dies
so what were supposed to just hold those things off until mary over there squeezes one out
that cant be
im only eight months pregnant
oh were fucked
we are so fucked
how are we supposed to survive here for a month
we wont have to
at this charlie goes white the realization hitting her
its coming soon isnt it
charlie sways on her feet
jeep rests a hand on her shoulder steadying her
with a clank michael re arms his weapon turns to the group with finality
if you want to live youll do what i say
this first attack was a test of our strength
the next one will be a test of our weakness
something much worse is on its way
everyone exchanges terrified looks
finally kyle steps forward
okay whats your plan
well keep watch on the roof in shifts of two
jeep go get some tools
we need to close up this window before somebody else goes out
jeep looks anxiously at charlie silent scared and then he follows after michael leaving charlie to stare at the shattered window the blinds flipping wildly in the wind
percy and kyle keep watch rifles at their sides
theyre wrapped up from head to toe in blankets to protect them from the cold and the flies
percy scans the horizon
momentary spectral flashes dot the darkness
theyre out there
sons of bitches
i can feel em
damn its cold
percy makes the unconscious motion of rubbing his hands together to keep them warm
sees the dog tags
you were in the army
navy two tours
but the second one didnt work out so well so i didnt get to go back for a third
suppose that makes me lucky in a way
served with bob you know
thats how i ended up in this place
what was it like
being in a war
he takes out his
nervously switches it from hand to hand
so whats with that gun
the one you killed grandma with
dont reckon its for huntin buck
i uh keep it for protection
protection from what
percy looks at him skeptically
yeah people who might try to give me a hard time you know
just regular people or uh
yeah well no not regular regular people
irregular people then
im talkin people whose job it is to give other people a hard time
kinda person who doesnt get enough fiber in their diet you know what im sayin
so its a work thing is it
this business of yours
you like it
kyles eyes narrow
who the fuck are you to be sweatin me man
i got my reasons for doin what i do
percy just stares at him penetrating
finally when i was a kid my father would sit by my bed every night before id go to sleep and hed say to me percy if you dont wake
up tomorrow if it turns out that today was your last day on earth would you be proud of what youve done in this life
cuz if you aint then you better start gettin square
kyle looks at percy fear in his eyes then he turns back to the darkness
and the evil that surrounds them
rolls between dirty fingers
bob plays with his trusty zippo with one hand and grills up some steaks with the other
he pauses in his cooking every few moments to take a slug from a can of beer
cant get it down fast enough
sandra sits at the counter across from him staring at a prescription bottle tipped in front of her pills spread around
bob glances over sees the devastation in her eyes
he pulls another can of beer from underneath the counter pops it and places it in front of her
on the house
she looks up at him
takes a sip
couldnt eat if my life depended on it
well i figure just cuz the worlds coming to an end it doesnt mean a mans gotta starve
all i can say is thank heavens they left the gas on
sandra takes another sip of beer
never much cared for beer
howards the beer drinker in the family
the moment the words leave her mouth the grief hits her again
she gathers up some pills from the counter tosses them back and downs her beer like theres no tomorrow
this is a battle shes losing
meanwhile in a booth across the diner audrey is fiddling with percys old radio
back and forth on the dial
listening for anything
nothing but static
up at the front of the diner jeep silently helps michael nail broken table planks across the shattered window
he eyes the strange tatoos running down michaels arms the two jagged wounds visible above his shirt line
what did you do
you know before you came here
michael considers the question a beat then i was a soldier a general in his army
well what changed
what made you leave
i was given an order i didnt believe in
off jeeps look he lost faith
michael drives the last nail into place securing the window
so what happens to you
after this is over
michael pauses a beat as if unsure how much to say then sometimes we have to face the thing we fear the most in order to be free of it
michael picks up his gun
its almost time for the next shift
michael heads for the roof leaving jeep to stare after him deep in thought
the faintest glint of sunlight through the dark red dusty haze
a new day has forced itself into existence
title december th am michael is searching the horizon in front of the diner for movement
his expression focused determined
on the other side of the roof bob keeps watch struggling to stay awake
the beer taking over
his eyes droop closed
sandra awakens with a start
but howards not there
and everyone else in the diner is still asleep
the drugs have started to wear off
and her fear is returning
sandra splashes water on her face
stares at herself in the mirror
a living wreck
sandra steps out of the bathroom
a whisper sandra
a beat then sandra
sandra spins around
is that you
it sure sounded like howard
this time its clear where the voice is coming from
sandra turns to face the back door
a desk blocks it
sandra ever so slowly approaches the door
from behind the door help me
sandra is stricken
what the hell is she going to do
thats when sandra notices the transom window above the door
she climbs onto the desk and stretches up until she can see out
ten feet away from the door
nailed but wait
it gets worse
his skin is covered with horrible black boils
and even worse than that
howards boils are breathing
sandra goes slack with horror
help me please
howards torn open shirt reveals the breathing pustules covering his body
he writhes in slow excruciating agony
sandra scrambles down off the desk and frantically pushes it away from the door
shes reaching for the dead bolt when audrey and kyle appear in the doorway
kyle races to restrain sandra
let me go
she struggles against him throwing a wild elbow that tags kyle in the face
down he goes
sandra is about to open the door when audrey pounces on her
the shouting from the back office awakens the rest of the sleepers
percy springs up
charlie is shaking jeep
the roar of wind ripping off the plain is all that can be heard
on bob as his head drops down with drunken fatigue
howard nailed to the upside down cross below
sandra and audrey are locked in battle
sandra slaps audrey hard
audrey stumbles over kyle and hits the floor
percy appears in the doorway
now is her last chance
sandra whips open the back door and thats when the world hits slow motion
howard is there
a few feet away
sandra races toward him
just behind her comes percy
and thats when the speed accelerates to normal and the boils covering howards body explode spraying streams of dark fluid toward sandra just at the moment percy spins around her
shielding her from the spray which hits him in the back
but hes not stopping
percy pushes sandra back into the diner the door slamming closed behind them
percy releases sandra letting her stumble hysterically into the room
kyle and jeep grab her forcing her to the ground
but shes not fighting anymore
charlie turns to look at percy who is still standing with his back to the door breathing heavily
he takes a step forward then falls to ground
the entire back side of his body is gone
covering a body
percys body lies covered on the table
bob stares ruefully at his dead friend
a broken man
tears stream down his face
he rolls the zippo between his fingers
jeep watches his father from the doorway
we should get back out there
just gimme another minute with him okay
jeep nods quietly leaves his father at the side of his dead friend
michael and bob are tying sandra to a chair
not like it looks like shes capable of going anywhere but you never know
across the diner charlie eyes michael cautiously
michael never goes for more than a few moments without looking up at her
its not lecherous
more like a protective father making sure his child hasnt strayed too far
in a booth audrey watches red eyed as michael restrains her mother
then she returns her attention to percys radio
trying to find something anything in the static
she brings her ear up close
is that a voice
she adjusts the antenna trying to bring the signal into focus
its a voice
you guys i think i got something here
everyone drops what theyre doing and quickly gathers around the radio
battling has been fierce
the numbers of casualties are unknown but all indications are that they must be unimaginably large
if youre just joining us were getting some of the first bits of good news if you can call it that since this apocalypse began just twenty four ago
a human militia has formed on the outskirts of las vegas and has begun to engage the enemy
also down in the four corners area weve been receiving unconfirmed reports of another resistance force gathering in red rock national in the northern mojave desert area
that cant be more than an hour up the highway from here
does that mean we can leave
were not going anywhere
what the hell are you talkin about
this is our chance
we cant risk being on the move when the child comes
its too dangerous
bob looks over at charlie defeated
she shakes her head anger building
she sweeps some plates off the counter and races for the bathroom
and as we fight this new enemy may god give us the strength to survive and show mercy for those of us who are already lost
charlie stands at the sink cigarette to her lips water running stealing a private moment
she takes a deep drag feels the smoke filling her lungs defiant
then she catches a look at herself in the mirror runs her hand along the curvature of her belly
tears well up in her eyes fear and anger overtaking her
she stamps out the cigarette in a fit of frustration
drifting past sleeping figures to find charlie wide awake sitting at a booth lost in thought
guess its your turn not to sleep
charlie looks up to see jeep sit down across from her
jeep sees the strain on her face
you mean besides the fact that i just found out that im the mother of the messiah
jeep smiles nods
crazy thing is
i didnt want this baby
i even went down to the clinic you know that
off jeeps reaction i remember sitting there in the waiting room absolutely sure i was doin the right thing
and thats when the feeling started
like i was falling into the deepest darkest hole imaginable
i couldnt breathe i couldnt speak
i kept thinking this must be what death is like
and when finally they called my name i ran
for a while after that i tried pretending that it was just cold feet that i could go back if i wanted to that i could decide to end it
like id planned
then id start to have that feeling again and i knew i didnt have a choice
somehow this had already been decided
and it made me hate this thing thats been growing inside me
a long beat as jeep considers her then you shouldnt say things like that charlie
it isnt right
youll get through this
i know you will
she turns to him the bitterness overtaking her how come you have so much faith in me jeep
god knows ive never given you or anybody else a reason to
or is it that you just cant find any other hard luck case to follow around
jeeps face hardens
he gets up
you know youre not the only whos suffered okay
let me know when you stop feeling sorry for yourself
and with that jeep walks away leaving charlie to stare after him disturbed and surprised by his response
sand and wind
the invisible sun is sinking
kyle and audrey are bundled together on the roof keeping watch
kyle is showing her how to hold the mp
then you just flip this audrey flips the safety
yeah i got it
all the way down
she points the gun out into the haze like shes been holding one all her life
off kyles surprised look dated this guy last summer
had a thing for guns
parents hated him
i bet they did
after a moment audrey switches the safety back on
hands the gun over to kyle
audrey stares into the red nothingness surrounding them
her expression growing distant
she seems to have aged years overnight
my parents hate everything i do
thats why we were moving
they thought a more wholesome environment would help me change my ways
so fucked up
only reason they care at all is cuz they dont want to be embarrassed in front of their friends at the country club
kyle considers her thoughtfully
the only time my old man ever paid attention to me was when i was doing somethin bad
so you know what i did
i got really good at being bad
she smiles at this confession
can obviously relate
he wipes a tear from her cheek
she leans in
his hands trace over her body
she claws at him
her passion growing out of control
shes practically devouring him
kyle can barely keep up
its like something else beyond sensual need has taken over
she moves down his chest
kyle leans his head back
just then the spot lights that illuminate the roof sign come to life
the young couple stops to look up at the brilliant red word paradise illuminated above them
down below the gas pumps light up
the stations fluorescents flicker on
all at once the entire diner comes back to life
the jukebox whirs on filling the room with merle haggards im a lonesome fugitive
bobs tv glows with bright rolling static
the electric fan spins on above the grill
jeep and michael move to look through the slats at the window
charlie is giving sandra some water through a straw
bob wanders in squinting at the sudden presence of light
we back in business
i dont think so
the truck stop is lit up like a christmas tree
if you didnt know better you might mistake the place for business as usual
kyle and audrey stand on the roof taking in the dramatic change
is it over
i dont know
headlights appear on the highway
raising his gun you better get downstairs
no i can handle it
kyle stares at audreys beautiful determined face
then he pulls out his silver
handing her the gun just in case
the headlights become a family minivan careening wildly off the highway to stop at the pumps
they aim their weapons at the vehicle
a well dressed man in his mid thirties jumps out of the car
he looks around nervously scared
then seeing that the coast is clear he offers a calming wave to his wife and young boy who wait anxiously for him inside the car
he races around to the gas pump
lowering his gun wait a minute
kyle are they
a distant screech from behind
kyle and audrey spin to look out over the back side of the diner
an army of dark shapes are swarming in fast
kyle looks urgently back at the family
the father lifts the pump
flips the lever
its a trap
they saw them coming and turned on the lights
its a fucking trap
kyle and audrey wave their arms frantically at the family
get back in your car
its a trap
but down below the man can only hear the sound of raging wind as he pumps the gas
kyle fires his gun in the air
at the sound of gunfire the man looks quickly up to the roof
his family heard it too and they start to scream to him
the man can only see silhouettes in this light but hes not waiting around to see if its friend or foe
audrey watches in horror as the dark shapes reach the diner
theyre not gonna make it
the father dashes to the drivers side
he throws open the door
but hes too late
he looks over his shoulder just in time to see a blur of movement rushing at him
his blood paints the car windows
kyle raises his mp to fire upon the dark shapes that surround the vehicle like swarming insects
the wife and boy scream hysterically as they are torn from the vehicle by skeletal hands
pushing his barrel down wait
youll hit them too
so kyle makes a desperately courageous play
he leaps onto the roofs sloped overhang sliding fast he drops to the ground in front of the diner
kyle charges the dark mob
creatures peel away from the woman and boy to confront kyle head on
he lets loose with a rain of bullets eviscerating everything that comes at him
the group gathered at the window sees kyle racing out toward the pumps
jesus christ what the hell is that boy doin
we have to get im back in here
bob springs into action
pushes the booth away from the front door
the sound of a gun cocking
bob looks over to see michael pointing a gun at his head
you open that door and we could all be dead
the possessed move in from all sides but kyle is remarkably agile dropping one after another in a stunning display
he closes in on the family blasting back the creatures huddled around them
he finds the young boy curled up with his hands protectively covering his face
kyle swoops down and gathers the boy into his arms
i got you
kyle moves on to the mother
but something odd is happening
the creatures have stopped coming at him
in fact theyre just standing there watching him
close on him as he senses something terribly wrong
kyle looks over at the boy in his arms
ghostly white eyes stare back at him
kyle drops to his knees
up on the roof audrey watches helplessly as kyle falls
bob kicks over a table in disgust
damn it all to hell
out the window they see audrey drop down from the roof and run towards kyle
the young boy stands over kyle silently watching the life drain from his body
the boy looks up to see audrey approaching fast
tears suddenly appear in his eyes
he opens his arms pleadingly to her
i didnt mean to
audrey raises the and
she keeps pulling the trigger
the boys tears stop instantly
he looks at her with an eerie calm for someone so young
youre gonna die now
the boy moves toward audrey stepping over kyles body
audrey backs away
she looks toward the entrance to the diner
blocked by advancing creatures
she notices the open door to the minivan
and so she bolts
audrey dives into the car as the throng of creatures rapidly closes in
she hammers the auto door lock
she moves to the center of the car as gruesome faces press against the windows
a nightmare come to life
charlie rushes to michaels side
do you have no heart
shes just a kid
but hes immovable
you cant let her die
grabbing a gun from the i swear if you dont do something i will
charlie cocks the gun moves toward the door
charlie looks back at him defiant
no one breathes
then raising his guns open the door
bob springs into action clearing the door and flipping the dead bolt
the door is opened and michael charges passed charlie and out into hell
with stunning calm michael marches straight for the pumps
in the minivan audrey screams as the windows begin to crack
shes running out of time
michael grabs a gas pump flips the lever and points it at the minivan
whats he up to
the creatures covering the car turn to look at michael as if theyve just now noticed him
and thats when he starts spraying gas at them
but wait theres more to this trick
up comes michaels glock in his other hand and blam
the spray of gas explodes into a spray of fire
the minivan is engulfed in flames
creatures tear away from the car like fiery comets through the night
the windows explode showering audrey with tiny shards of glass
michael drops the gas pump
he reaches through a fire rimmed broken car window and unlocks the door
audrey looks up to see michaels expressionless face circled come with me
meanwhile fire is spreading quickly under the car
michael pulls audrey from the flaming vehicle
and together they run toward the open diner door
everyones eyes go wide at the insanity theyre witnessing
audrey is the first one in
michael is almost there
but the fire is faster engulfing michael
pulling charlie away from the door get back
bursting out of the flames michael marches confidently into the diner
jeep slams the door closed just as the wall of everyone hits the deck as the fire shoots through the slats covering the windows like spindly fingers reaching for prey
michaels clothes are a smoky smoldering mess
jeep and bob rush to pat him down
audreys coughing from the smoke
ill get some water
charlie dashes behind the counter to the sink
she fills up a pitcher of water
she turns away from the sink with the filled pitcher
the young boy with the lifeless white eyes stands before her wielding an enormous butchers knife
the pitcher shatters loudly on the floor
the boy swings the knife at her slicing open the waitress outfit covering her pregnant belly
charlie tumbles back to the ground behind the counter
she frantically pushes herself away from the approaching boy
but she doesnt have far to go before shell run out of room to maneuver
cmon dont be scared
i just wanna play with your baby
shes backed against the end of the counter
the boy raises the knife to strike
charlie grabs a baking pan off a shelf
swings it out in front of her body like a shield as the knife is driven down
the knife hits the pan hard and stops
but the boys hands dont
they slip off the handle and run right down the blade
the knife clatters to the ground
the boy instinctively raises his hands to strike again but theres no knife
charlie watches in horror as the boy calmly realizes that his thumbs are missing
blood sprays from the stumps
charlie pulls her legs in close then rockets them out at the boys chest
hes catapulted away from her
michael leaps over the counter landing in front of charlie guns ready for action
but the boy is gone
are you hurt
charlie shakes her head no
where is he
thats when the electricity goes out once again plunging the hes still in here
flashlight beams fan out across the diner
lighting under chairs
where the fuck is he
a scampering sound
everybody spins to track the location of the sound
as soon as they move in one direction the scampering is heard in another
jeeps light catches something on the ground
a trail of hes bleeding
jeep raises his light up the wall where the trail of blood what the fuck
bob flails around trying to pull the boys small but deadly strong arms away from his neck
jeep cant get a clear shot
bobs gasping for air
michael grabs the boy and fiercely rips him off of bobs back
he swings the boy around like a living shot put
jeep and bob whip up their guns as michael throws the wicked creature into the air
sandras vacant face flickers in the light as the sound of gunfire and inhuman screaming fill the diner
and then in moments
all is quiet
behind the counter audrey helps charlie to her feet
doubles over clutching her stomach
michael lowers his flashlight
clear fluid runs down charlies legs
a flickering light emanates from within the diner
title december th am the sound of charlies scream carries us to charlie drenched in sweat is writhing on the ground with michael holding down her arms and audrey kneeling
between her legs
pots of steaming water surround them
what am i supposed to do
just cause im a girl doesnt mean i automatically know how to do this
just do as i say
yeah but how do you know how to do this
bob and jeep keep watch
the spectral lights in the distance seem to be growing larger closer
charlies screaming rises up from below
what a way to bring a child into the world
looks over at jeep she ever tell you his name
shes never said
i just assumed it was joe danvers
you know how shes always had a thing for bad boys
bob hears the spite in jeeps voice
jeep sooner or later shell realize youre the best thing thats ever happened to her
i thought you said i should move on
cant a father be wrong sometimes
jeep considers bob with a smile then comes the sound
a deep long body rumbling tone rising up off the plain as if emanating from the largest horn ever constructed
what was that
the spectral lights dot the landscape now with untold numbers
michael reacts to the sound
an urgency comes over him
audrey arrives with more steaming water
what is that
we have to hurry
whaddya mean hurry
this isnt something you can exactly hurry is it
charlie i need you to push
i need you to push as hard as you can
michael whos coming
charlie pushes tears streaming down her face delirious with pain
its a gruesome bloody affair
its getting close
were almost there
jeep and bob watch helplessly as the army of creatures has closed within a hundred yards of the diner
their ranks stretch back seemingly without end into the darkness
were not gonna make it outta here are we
bob looks at his son
the agony stretched across his face
im sorry jeep
this shouldnt be happening to you
jeep rests a comforting hand on his fathers shoulder
bob pulls his son close and hugs him with all his might tears filling his eyes
amidst the dirt and darkness charlie lets out a final agonizing scream
and then comes a babys cries
audrey eyes wide holds up the child
oh my god
we did it
charlie you did it
audrey places the child in charlies arms
she stares at the baby holding it at a distance unsure of whether to embrace it or be terrified by it
a commitment shes not yet ready to make even at this late hour
the babys okay
charlie looks to audrey tears streaming down her face
audrey looks to michael unsure
give her a minute
audrey nods takes the baby back from charlie tries to soothe him by pacing around the diner
another drone of the horn rattles the walls
audrey reacts crosses to the counter turns on the radio trying to drown out the sound of the approaching menace
out of the static the haunting sounds of bing crosby singing silent night fills the room
the quiet before the storm
michael helps charlie quickly clean herself up
she stares at him a burning spite in her eyes
so are we safe now
is it over
killing the child would have ended the war before it had begun
now at least he will have a chance to grow up a chance to lead the world out of darkness
those words provide her little comfort
and what happens until then
youll need to teach him how
charlie shakes her head this is all too much
what makes you think i can do that
what makes you think i want to do that
if hes so important why dont you take him
each of us has a burden
this one is yours and yours alone
maybe someday youll understand what that means
off charlies look we move across the diner where audrey approaches her mother kneels down in front of her
despite how much her mother pisses her off it breaks her heart to see her in such a demoralized state
can you hear me
holds up the baby we did it
the babys alive
audrey contd mama
if sandra hears her daughter it doesnt show in her face
tears well up in audreys eyes as she moves away from her mother
but we hold here and
drift down behind the chair to reveal sandras hands are loosening the bonds
blood trickles from where the ropes cut through her skin
drifting through the dark shapes as the babys cries reverberate up and down the ranks
they begin to look about frantically agitated by the sound
some even begin to back away from the diner
off in the distance the diner is but a dim flickering light above the plain
it could almost be mistaken for a stable in a desert town a long time ago
three stars burn bright and low in the black sky
all around us the dark creatures are cowering from sound of the crying infant whose wails seem to grow even louder the further away from the diner we get
in the darkness below we see the lights of the legions of creatures dot the landscape and at the center of it all the truck stop
the sound of wings beating against the wind
jeep and bob enter the diner to see michael helping charlie to her feet while audrey continues to pace the bundle of bloody blankets cradled in her arms
theyre moving away
the possessed cant come near the child so he sent someone that can
someone like me
hes come to do what i wouldnt
on jeep as the realization hits him
michael looks at jeep
you were the one who was supposed to kill the baby
that was the order you didnt obey
michael nods grimly
charlie looks urgently at michael
whats he talking about
the baby cries louder
michael what the hells he talking about
there was never meant to be a second coming
but weve just changed that
the child lives
the future is unwritten
theres still hope
charlie shaken by this revelation reaches out to audrey
audrey moves to hand over the baby to charlie
sandra backs away from them moving toward the front door
hers is the face of madness
stay away from me
dont come any closer
dont do it lady
you heard what he said
they just want the baby
maybe if we just give it to them then theyll let us go
michael cocks his gun
points it at sandra
charlie squares off with sandra panic in her eyes
give him to me
you never wanted him in the first place
charlie stares at her in horror the truth of those words rattling her to the very core
sandra is almost to the front door
its just one baby
a brilliant spectral light pours into the diner
sandra is blinded
she raises a hand to block the light
and thats when michael fires
sandra staggers back blood dripping from the hole in her forehead and
charlie screams and the world moves into slow motion
and everything suddenly goes very quiet
michael fires again
blowing sandras body back through the doorway
jeep watches the baby sail slowly through the air
the time for jeep to act is now
jeep dives for the baby
catching the bundle of rags mere inches from the ground
and then he looks up to see
the dark silhouette of a man approaching from out of the spectral light
a man with wings
jeeps eyes grow wide as the fierce angel steps into the diner
but this looks like no angel weve seen before
this is a creature built for war
rough hewn battle scarred
his body armor making him appear disturbingly insect like
his wings are not feathery or gentle
rather they are hard mechanical an organic machine
the angels wings retract with clockwork like precision
and now that we see the his face clearly we notice his striking resemblance to michael
we might even mistake them for brothers
his name is gabriel
gabriel raises a massive ferocious strangely mechanical looking mace in his powerful hands
and the world returns to normal speed as gabriel brings the mace arcing down at jeep
the weapon just misses him hitting the floor in a spray of sparks literally cracking the ground
gabriel brings the mace up again
jeep wont be so lucky twice
bob charges at the creature sub machine gun blazing
gabriel reacts by instantly unfolding his wings and launching himself into the air
the bullets clawing up the wall behind him
but bobs heroic move has given jeep time to get up and run with the baby for the back of the diner
he thrusts the child into charlies hands
and without even thinking she pulls the child protectively to her chest
gabriel drops down in front of bob whipping his wings around like a deadly razor sharp fan
bob stops firing a look of surprise stretches over his face
his gun falling from his hands
blood begins to pour out of the slice across his belly
with a sweep of his hand gabriel sends bob flying across the diner where he crashes down behind the counter near the stove
michael grabs jeeps hand before the boy can rush back into the fray
you must protect the child now
what about you
my path ends here
you are the true protector
you always have been
jeep shakes his head panic setting in
but i dont know what to do
find the prophets
learn to read the instructions
michael lets go of jeeps hand and turns away to face gabriel leaving jeep to contemplate those final words
and thats when jeep opens his hand to find the keys to michaels police cruiser
jeep looks up from the keys to see charlie audrey and the baby
the responsibility crashing in on him
then he closes his hand around the keys determination building
charlie looks past jeep to see michael returning to the fray
we cant leave him
we have no choice
we have to get to red rock
he pulls charlie past the counter toward the back office
jeep stops when he sees his fathers broken body lying on the ground by the stove in a pool of his own blood
bobs half open eyes focus on his son
in his outstretched hand is that goddamn zippo lighter
and next to that a broken gas pipe leading to the stove
jeep is terrified
jeep tries to help him up
leave me jeep
my place is here remember
bob smiles weakly at his son and says simply run
and so jeep fighting back tears does what his father says
audrey and jeep push the desk away from the door
charlie opens it
sand swirls in around her
and jeep leads the trio out the door
michael and gabriel square off in the diner not like enemies but like brothers on opposite sides of a terrible family conflict
i knew hed send you gabriel
you were always so eager to please him
the rebellious son
noticing michaels scars pity about your wings
they would have helped you now
to not feel their burden
is a dream
you think you can defy him and not pay the price
the child lives
what happens to me doesnt matter now
yours is a fools sacrifice
you can help them sneak out the back door but they wont escape
and neither will you brother
michael slowly approaches gabriel
im not running anymore
gabriel hesitates doubt clouding his face
this was not what he was expecting
join with me
you dont need do this
theres another way
a beat then gabriels expression hardens
there is no other way
he pulls back from michael raising the mace sching
long deadly sharp spikes bursts from all its sides
as if it wasnt bad ass enough
and the fight begins
its mace against machine gun and strangely enough it seems under gabriels deft control the mace is the vastly superior weapon
with the aid of his wings gabriel moves with staggering speed defying gravity to avoid the rain of bullets
the place is getting absolutely shot to hell
michael leaps from table top to table top as gabriel brings the mace brutally down splintering everything it touches
michael leaps onto the last unbroken table top spins to fire
gabriel pushes into the air jabbing a spike straight into the barrel of michaels mp
the gun explodes in michaels hands sending him rocketing backwards where he lands on the counter
gabriel swoops in fast
michael kicks him in the chest sending him fluttering back
michael thrusts himself to his feet
gabriel recovers jabs again
michael grabs a hold of bobs ceiling mounted tv for support and lifts his body just above the deadly spike
michael kicks gabriel in the head momentarily stunning him
michael dives at gabriel landing an awesome flurry of punches
gabriel is rattled back by the assault
he clumsily lifts his mace and thrusts with it
michael narrowly evades the razor point which drives into a wall
michael smashes down on gabriels wrist cracking the bones
a swift kick to the chest and gabriel is thrust crashing back losing his grip on the weapon
michael takes a running leap onto gabriels back
gabriel launches wildly into the air trying to throw michael off
they hit the ceiling but michael hangs on
choking the life out of gabriel
audrey and jeep help charlie quickly move around the side of the diner where the cruiser is parked
they are buffeted by winds and sand
jeep puts charlie and the baby into the front passenger seat while audrey hustles in back
jeep rounds to the drivers side
jeep frantically tries to get the right key into the ignition
jeep turns the key but the engine struggles to fire up
come on jeep
jeep gives it some gas but the engines not catching
a dark shape pounces onto the hood of the car
the light catches it revealing the disfigured face and beard of a shopping mall santa claus his oversized belly gruesomely distended
jeep pumps the gas and the engine bursts to life
the creatures about to punch a fist through the glass throwing the car in hang on
jeep floors it causing the cruiser to rocket backwards toward the highway
jeep pulls the wheel hard and the cruiser whips around a full onto the road
jeep throws it in drive just as the possessed santa rises from the pavement
pedal to the metal
the creature doesnt have a chance as the cruiser plows into him
bones crunch as a flash of red and white is sent sailing over the car and tumbling down onto the road behind them in a cloud of dust
jeep clenches the wheel pedal to the floor
okay we need to figure out our weapon situation
hopefully michael didnt take everything out of the car
jeep places his glock on the dash
he sees that hes got a police issue shotgun in the front seat rack
charlie searches under her seat
pulls out a
is this what i think it is
now just put it down
charlie places it onto the seat
audrey fishes around in the backseat
holding up each item okay all i got is a flare gun thing
looks like we got a box of flares to go with it
a a flare gun
and a grenade
hands charlie the glock load this
audrey can you figure out how to load that flare gun without killing us all
i can try
try real hard okay
audrey anxiously sets about loading the flare gun
gabriel flies into a wall in an attempt to crush michael
he fails that but succeeds in leaving a massive dent
gabriel runs flies for the opposite wall
this one doesnt hold and the two enemies crash through it into the bathroom
unbelievably michael is still holding on
gabriel is up
he thrusts himself back into the bathroom mirror
it shatters painfully behind michael
gabriel rages out of the bathroom and into the diner
michael continues to ride him like a wild bull
gabriel slams michael into a wall once more
its a brutal struggle
gabriel spots his mace sticking out of the wall within arms reach
he grabs it holding it futilely in front of him
from this angle hed never be able to hit michael with it
gabriels strength is giving way
michael is winning
gabriel lets out a tremendous roar and plunges one of the maces long spikes into his own stomach
michaels eyes go wide with surprise his grip loosens
gabriel has run them both through
gabriel rips the mace from his body and stumbles forward
blood pours from a huge hole in michaels chest
right through his heart
gabriel looks down at the hole in his own belly
not nearly as bad as michaels
apparently theres not a lot of blood left in this guy
michael falls to his knees
gabriel looms over michael
michael looks up at him blood leaking from his mouth
you always wanted to live like one of them
now youll know how it feels to die like one of them
gabriel raises the mighty mace above his head
michael closes his eyes
the mace comes swinging down
the cruiser hits the fly storm
nothing is visible beyond the windows
buzzing surrounds them
jeep turns on the windshield wipers
hits the brights
on the speedometer as their speed slows to a crawl
i cant fuckin see
charlies desperately trying to soothe her screaming baby
on the air vents as flies start crawling in
gabriel is looking down upon michaels broken body
something is happening to his skin
the dark writing that covers his body is beginning un write itself and disappear
charlie is struggling to close the air vents to stop the inflow of buzzing insects
its not working
she looks to jeep in desperation but something more frightening catches her attention
the intricate writing is beginning to appear on jeeps arm snaking its way up from his wrists like vines
jeep your arm
jeep sees it eyes go wide
what is it
a beat as jeep remembers michaels parting words
gabriel watches as the last of the writing fades from michaels body when he hears a faint clicking sound from somewhere in the diner
gabriel moves gracefully through the destroyed diner toward the source of the clicking
he steps behind the counter and finds bob lying in a massive pool of blood
it takes the creature a moment to realize that the clicking sound is coming from bobs silver zippo
bob is focusing every last ounce of life in his body to lighting that lighter
bob looks at gabriel
and with one last brush of his thumb bobs trusty zippo gabriels eyes go wide as the tiny flame dances in front of the stoves broken gas line
gabriel spins and runs like hell as the gas explodes
the massive explosion rocks the slow moving vehicle
in the rearview mirror jeep sees the cloud of fire mushrooming up in the sky behind them
its eerily magnificent
the swarm its fading
jeep looks back to the road as sure enough the fly swarm suddenly dissipates all around them revealing a clear view of the highway ahead
jeep knows at what price this good fortune has come
the cruiser punches through the burning paradise sign smashing it into fiery pieces
the cruiser charges on down the endless highway burning bits of sign swirling in its wake
from the back seat audrey watches the fire recede into the distance
i cant believe it
is it really over
up front jeep stares out at the dark road ahead
its just starting
burning wreckage everywhere
drifting through it until we settle on the spike scepter stuck firmly in the ground
flames ring the handle
the cruiser blazes down the highway
charlie cradles the baby apprehensive
the baby looks up at her smiles
she cant help but smile back at him
jeep eyes her
better not hold him too long
might get attached
charlie looks over feels his lingering anger
look im sorry for what i said to you earlier bout you following me around
i didnt mean it
nothin to be sorry about
i did follow you around
at least now i know there was a good reason
charlies reacts a bit stung
jeep tries to hide his pleasure that the tables have turned at least a little
charlie is about to respond when audrey leans in from the back seat
she points ahead to a beaten up road sign that says now entering red rock national park next rest stop okay all we gotta do is the roof buckles above
the windows blow out
jeep charlie and audrey slip frantically down in their seats as the roof presses down at them
the windows burst
jeep grabs the glock and fires wildly up at the roof
gabriel takes a direct hit in the thigh causing him to slide off the roof and onto the trunk where he grabs a hold of the rear window frame for
with tremendous strength gabriel pulls his upper body through the broken back window toward audrey
jeep swings the gun around
gabriel takes one in the shoulder but it doesnt slow him down
audrey the flare gun
audrey desperately tries to load a flare while avoiding gabriels grasp
jeep cant get off another shot without the risk of hitting audrey
gabriel is almost entirely in the car now
audrey swings the flare gun toward gabriel but he knocks her hand aside just as she pulls the trigger and the flare goes off inside the car
the car swerves madly
the flare ricochets through the cabin lighting it up like the fourth of july
gabriel lunges for charlie just as the flare bounces off the windshield ping
and nails him right in the face setting and that gives jeep the chance to swing around and fire
gabriel is blown back partially through the rear window
he holds onto the car with an iron grip
starts to pull himself back in
nothing slows this guy down
jeep pulls the trigger again and
audrey frantically reloads the flare gun
brings it up to fire but hes too fast
gabriel knocks her into the side of the car with a sweep of his hand
shes out cold
now hes clawing his way unobstructed toward charlie again
jeep knows theres only one thing to do
get down on the floor
charlie pushes herself and the baby down on the floor in front of the passenger seat
jeep punches it
the speedometer leaps ahead
gabriels now completely in the car
gabriel lunges over the passenger seat grasping for charlie his ferocious hand only inches from her and the baby when
get off her you fucking asshole
audrey leaps onto gabriel pulling him away from charlie just in time
he flails wildly about but this young girl rides him like one helluva a cowboy
do it jeep
do it now
the intertwined bodies of gabriel and audrey hit the road with a sickening crunch and roll into a ball of fire
the cruiser spins out of control swerving off the road and careening into a large rock formation
this ride is over
jeeps side of the car is crushed
blood is running down his forehead
charlie crawls up from the floor
he tries to focus on her
she kicks open her door and begins pulling him out
and what about
nothing could have survived that
she saved us jeep
audrey saved us
now cmon we gotta go
charlie the baby bundled in her hands leads jeep away from the demolished cruiser
jeep and charlie battered and bruised struggle to make the long climb up the ridge
charlie looks up
stars completely fill the pre dawn sky
how can this happen
how can this happen in a world so beautiful
jeep follows her gaze to the sky
jeep shifts his eyes to the top of the ridge just ahead
cmon were almost there
they are only a few steps from the edge of the ridge when charlie screams
jeep pushes her and the baby out of the way just as gabriel comes down hard in front of them kicking up a cloud of dust
gabriels mechanical wings haltingly retract
the crash has done some serious damage
much of his skin has burned away
chunks of his armor and flesh are missing as well including a large part of his head revealing that under his human visage is a nightmarish creature
gabriel charges at jeep fast
jeep whips up his glock blam
gabriel takes the bullet then slaps the gun out of jeeps hand
jeep throws a wild punch connects with gabriels chin rocking him back
more annoyed than surprised gabriel knocks jeep savagely to the ground
jeep struggles quickly to his feet comes right back at gabriel swinging
but gabriel simply knocks him to the dirt again
jeep slowly gets up once more bleeding hurt
raises his fists
this kid will simply not give up
jeep moves in again swinging hard but gabriel blocks it shoots out a hand and grabs jeep by throat lifting him clear off the ground
you should have worried more about saving yourself
jeeps feet dangle
his eyes bulge out
he claws at gabriels iron fast grip but theres no hope
charlie watches in horror
dont kill him
but gabriel is doing just that
jeep is rapidly losing consciousness
the battle is lost
go to sleep
jeeps eyes flutter
hes almost gone
ill give you the baby
this gets gabriels attention
charlie climbs to her feet holding the bloody bundle out to him
i dont want this responsibility
tears run down her face
shes dead fucking serious
gabriel lets go of jeep
he falls to the ground gasping desperately for air
gabriel takes the bundle from charlie turning away from her
and as the childs cries are extinguished an eternal darkness at last descended upon the world
he peels the cloth back revealing
he spins around to face charlie
shes holding the pin
the creature is gone at last
the sound of a baby cooing
charlie picks the child up out of the brush
she helps jeep to his feet and together they slowly make their way to the top of the ridge
jeep and charlie stand overlooking the desert valley below
on their faces reacting to what they see
charlie takes jeeps hand in hers
we made it
yep we sure did
and now we see it too vast
no signs of life
no resistance force
taking it in
im sure theyre just over the next ridge
he glances at charlie
worry in her eyes
what if were on our own now
dont be afraid
well be okay
at those words charlie looks deep into jeeps eyes
sees a confidence in them shes never seen before
and she leans in and kisses him
when they part jeep stares back at her with surprise
then the surprise melts into a smile
and they descend the ridge
out of sight leaving us with a view once again of a blood red sun rises behind the distant mountains
the unbearable cold will soon become an unbearable heat
and were back where we started
a young womans voice
someday when my son is older i will tell him about the time of his birth when all the world was covered in a great darkness
jeep is at the wheel
he looks aged scarred from the experience
his exposed arms are completely covered with the intricate writing
the boy he once was is gone at last and the warrior protector has replaced him
and how just at the moment when everything seemed lost
charlie sits across from him the baby cradled in her arms
its strange but you might actually mistake them for a happy family
of course youll have to ignore the arsenal of weaponry in the back seat
a mighty warrior fell in order to save me
jeep glances over at charlie and the baby
he smiles at the image of maternal bliss
and a boy faced his fear and rose up to save us all
the sun shines through the car windows filling our eyes with its fiery light
