written by travis milloy a darkness like no other a silence that is unsettling
sharp pinholes of light show a sea of distant stars across the void of outer space
our own motion is only realized as an enormous object slowly moves towards us taking shape
a space ship of unimaginable size a tubular freighter easily ten times larger then any aircraft carrier
at first glance it appears lifeless and adrift but slowly the small glow of cockpit windows come into view as we move closer
moonlight cuts across the hull displaying the name eden
where were you
when eden was lost
like every other kid on my block i was in the middle of a dream envious of those who were chosen to be part of mankinds greatest quest
dreaming of the unknown and trying to imagine what only the lucky few would encounter
we push in towards the cockpit windows and
inside the flight deck its ghostly vacant rows of empty flight chairs and numerous guidance computers gently blinking
with half filled coffee cups and jackets hung over the seat backs
it appears the control deck has been suddenly evacuated
muffled screams are heard somewhere deeper inside the ship
as the entire world watched in wonder there were only a few skeptical of the journeys success
only a few
who would be right
the further we move into the ship
signs of violence appear smears of dark blood sharply standing out on the bright white paneling and several broken computer screens
the muffled screams grow louder and clearer
an argument between men panicked rage over lapping
camera slowly moves past a corner to see the middle of a violent confrontation
one officer is locked inside a sleep chamber banging on the glass and pleading with panic
another officer is on the floor mortally wounded his body still twitching with his head bashed in
the insane officer a young corporal is moving from terminal to terminal typing in commands with a casual and emotionless nature
blood streams have run down his face from both ears and nose as he continues to type commands into the flight computer
heightening the trapped officers muffled
the insane officer hits the final command key and warning buzzers ignite with flashing lights
he closes his eyes taking a breath of relief
the trapped officer begins pounding on the glass with a crazed panic as the insane officer calmly goes to his own sleep pod and climbs inside sealing the hatch
control panels flash and hydraulics ignite
like a row of tumbling dominos each of the sleep chamber pods shift positions with a shush of hydraulics and then
they are launched with a roar of micro jets
were suddenly back into the unsettling silence as
like a bee hive thats exploded thousands of coffin sized sleep pods are ejected from the ship in unison
they are sent tumbling into open space in every direction as the ship slowly continues its unaffected course
the trapped officer is seen screaming in silence inside his own pod
we slowly float towards an astroid field
as we grow closer its the sea of sleep pods slowly floating through space
where was i
when i heard wed lost eden
just like every other kid on my block
i was dreaming
of being one who would be chosen to follow
as we move closer to the asteroid field of sleep pods its obvious that time has passed a single skeleton inside each of the pods hands in a clawing position
towards the glass
we push in towards one pod moving towards the skull still locked in a screaming position wide mouthed and
a rumble passes
inside a coffin size chamber a dim glow of light seeps through a small glass porthole
a man is asleep a mask attached to his face tubes of liquid feeding into his arms
corporal bower military physique chiseled features
his chest lightly expanding blood pulsating through his veins
lights flicker past and his body comes to life muscles flinching breath quickening
he squirms with discomfort ripping away the mask
he gasps trying to scream
his scream is muffled under three inches of glass
the hatch door is hit with a thud and white gases erupt from the edges
the door bursts open and bower scampers out struggling to rip away the feeding tubes
he hits the floor naked and gasping
his pores ignite dripping sweat
he tries to get to his feet but his legs wobble underneath him collapsing
he yells at the floor
burns are red
blue his voice echoes into the dark alone in a cavernous room as he pauses struggling for orientation
he gets to his feet muscles twitching
his short cropped hair is
a constant low rumble is present joined by the occasional moan and creak of a large ship
a shudder travels through the room with a random flicker of lights to reveal
a massive steel compartment tangled with technology
its cold and institutional
high tech computer terminals slope out of the floor
the flicker passes taking us into black
we hear him fumbling through the room switches are thrown with no result and compartments are pulled opened and
a glow stick comes to life
he squints at his darkened surroundings with confusion
a drip of liquid catches his eye and he staggers back to his sleep pod
he grabs the dangling tubes that were ripped from his arm and he sucks on the tube pulling as much liquid into his mouth as possible
after a few heavy gulps he suddenly heaves towards the floor
he painfully forces himself to drink gasping
he looks up to notice two sleep chambers next to his own
he leans closer with the glow stick to see the first one the name plate reading nd lt
the third pods name plate reads lt
deep inside there is the figure of a man asleep under a mask
he turns back to his own pod seeing the name plate that reads corporal bower
even this name doesnt seem familiar
the loss of memory heightens his fear even more as a shiver travels through his body while he staggers towards a nearby computer terminal
he taps the keys on a computer terminal
he frowns leaning closer
as he taps the keyboard powder blooms out from under his fingers
he wipes the surface of the panel to see a thick layer of dust
under the smear is
elysium flight systems operation terminal d
he pulls focus to see
his fingers are trembling uncontrollably an odd vibration of nerves
he slowly makes a fist with concern
bower walks along a row of storage lockers reading each name plate
he stops at the locker labelled corp
he pauses mumbling the name once again with no recognition
he opens the locker to see an assortment of personalized belongings uniform and gear none of it seeming familiar
he uses a towel to wipe off the layer of sweat and oily substance coating his body pausing to see an identification tattoo on his forearm that reads flt a
he pulls on a black flight suit emblems and military markings of rank on the chest
he pulls on shoes and a tool belt with a high powered pen lamp
on the inside of the locker is a emergency manual card with block figures displaying breathing and stretching exercises labelled hyper sleep disorientation recovery procedures
reading to himself in the event of mild memory loss
resulting from extended he freezes on
a photo tucked inside the door
evalon a beautiful young woman smiling towards camera
he stares at the photo his frown deepening with confusion
he checks the back for a name but nothing
he tucks the photo into a pocket and exits
bower waves his hand over a sensor
he steps in front of a heavy set of steel doors flipping several switches and
bower breaks open a storage bin pulling out beverage packets and a cup taking a seat at the control desk
with evalons photograph leaned against the console he becomes lost in a gaze as he gulps down nutrient pills and stirs an instant coffee as we
there is a conflict in his eyes memories trying to return
an image flashes past evalon smiling as bower kneels next to her gripping her hands
bowers gaze remains hollow frown deepening as he sips the cup and
winces with disgust
he pans the pen lamp across the ceiling and toward the sounds
paytons sleep chamber
thump thump thump muffled and desperate
bower jumps back as someone kicks their way out from inside the hatch bursting open
payton a man in his forties but the rugged physique of a man half his age lean and agile
his military style hair cut is also pure white
gasping for breath he hits the floor as bower tries to help him
payton jerks with shock
payton chokes and gasps then glances up giving bower a once over with a frown and a sobering tone
who are you
youre waking from corporal
this is disorientation from corporal
thats right im wanna get that fucking light out of my eyes pal
payton rubs his face with a frown
were aboard the elysium
from what ive elysium
where are we
theres no power in the com and i cant even wheres the
rest of the crew
its our shift
our rotation i believe so
arent they suppose to be here
to wake us
i dont know where anyone is
payton takes breaths trying to regain his senses glancing around at their darkened surroundings
hit the lights will ya
were having some power problems who woke you up
umm not sure
it had to have been the flight computer
theres no one here
off his look except us
cold in here
bower grabs him a towel and water container turning back to see payton doesnt waste any time stretching his limbs
theres no power coming off the main grid
cant fire any of the
searching for word dynos
cant even open the doors
payton glances to the other empty sleep chamber with a frown
off his look our nd lieutenant
i dont know where he is
it was empty when i woke up
none of the systems are on line
mainframe is down so i dont know how or why it engaged independently bower
until i have two coffees youre just gonna have to repeat all this shit so lets just idle here for a bit
i just just glad to see you awake
a little concerned
i didnt know what to do if payton gets to his feet stumbling
bower catches him under the arm as they stagger into the wall
im on it
bower helps him to the locker room as lights flicker past
payton staggers along the row of storage lockers as bower helps guide him with the flashlight beam
payton pauses with a frown as he glances across the name plates none of them seeming familiar
bower gestures toward the locker the name plate reads lt
this is you sir
how do you know that
the name on your sleep pod sir
payton opens the door to see his belongings inside a photo of wife marianne inside the door
he stares at it with utter confusion
bower takes this in looking to the memory recovery card inside the locker
it says that the memory loss is only suppose to be a momentary loss thats very reassuring
i guess when you gamma the brain into extended rem sometimes it can take a while to get it back
payton pulls on his flight uniform and squeezes his feet into his shoes
bower notices the identification tattoo on his forearm partially obscured from view flt
obscured by grime hair and angle
unlike his own paytons tattoo is faded with age
ive been awake for at least an hour and i still cant remember my
listen the last time i crawled out of a hyper bunk it took me
quite a while to get it all back
bower holds his frown as payton squeezes his finger into a wedding ring
your last flight sir
the kuiper belt odyssey
dont worry itll come back eventually
payton kisses the photo of his wife
ive gone through this before
i just cant remember why i would agree to do it again
payton goes to close his locker and bower motions with a serious tone
i know this is going to sound strange but do you even know where were going
i can remember the training but
not the mission
know the procedures not the
i figured youd tell me
didnt even know the ships name until i saw it on the console
for all i know this was another damn training exercise trust me its not
if this is a simulation
payton notices both of their reflections off the mirrored panel inside the locker
revealing their white hair
someone is taking the joke a little far
he shuts the locker and they exit the flashlights beam panning away taking us into darkness
bower and payton are standing at the control console the screens flickering with distortion
bower hands him a coffee and payton takes a sip
with a wince of disgust
none of the activators are working
we can ride two hundred thousand tons of space freighter across the galaxy without a dent in the hood but cant get one good cup of coffee
payton flips a few switches with no result of power
without the mainframe we cant connect
i dont know how well ever be able to payton is in his element at the control desk flipping open an emergency auxiliary power panel
he snaps open a handle and he forcefully gives it several rotations with a moan of whirling magnetos
the hand crank allows a dim glow of electricity to the light panels
oh i didnt even think of that
payton gives him a look with a grin and flips a switch
payton on the con
this is lt
payton of flight team
how do you know that
bower pulls up his sleeve exposing his tattoo id
payton nods good thinking
payton of flight team five
does anyone copy
anyone awake up there
team four suppose to be here for the shift rotation
where could they be
maybe they couldnt get to us
bower eyes the third empty sleep chamber
where could he have gone
payton gazes off blankly
a rumble of flickering lights pass and the computer screens slowly fade going black
the power systems must be free floating off blown circuits or something
the over ride grid wont even lock in
whatta ya think
i think we need to find a deck of cards and call the union
distant thumps are heard overhead and they freeze
watching the ceiling with uncertainty
is up there
systems keep re booting after each surge
that could be anything
thumps fade as the ship eerily moans and creaks
i say we get out of here
id rather be up and out then stuck in the trunk
the room is blocked by the two heavy steel doors on either end security doors ten feet wide
payton leads the way towards one end gesturing towards the doors
were not far from the bridge but without the circuits locked in
i dont know how we could ever get this thing open
as they approach their flashlight beams pan across the door to see jagged chips and scratches all along the edges
tools are scattered on the floor the control panel ripped open
somebody was trying to get out
i think it was built to protect us
gesturing to the third pod well he got out
a rumble approaches
another shudder that flickers the lights
they watch the ceiling as bower counts in his head as it fades
cycle is broken
its not circuitry
reactor timing is off set in the core
seems sporadic but its not
each revolution decreasing before starting over from the beginning
its trying to reconnect but it wont until its reset
how the hell do you know that
i cant remember my own but i know everything there is to know about that damn reactor
the training stuck
and i know that
another shudder approaches
thats twelve revolutions before recycling
and this one will only last as they watch the ceiling their flashlight beams stop on a small ventilation shaft thats been ripped open
they exchange a look and
their lights spill inside an endless steel shaft only a foot and a half in diameter leading into darkness
now if we only had a monkey and a rope
payton climbs down as bower rotates his jaw with eagerness
our nd lieutenant must have gone this way
dont you think
its the only way out
i think were better off
waiting here for what
if the mainframe is off line
were not going to be able to get to the bridge or even be able to open that door from the other side but we can at least find out
whats do you remember just how big this ship is kid
we dont know where that will come out if at all but we can at least try to i cant do that
listen i have to take a handful of doxitol just to get in the hyper bunk
i can take a lot thats not one of em
i can take it
real boy scout is that it
you get lost in there and youre a footnote in the you can guide me
over two way
payton eyes him over with reluctance
you know theres something wrong
how long can we wait in here before we have to try something
gesturing to nd lt pod how long did he wait
silent stare as a shudder passes flickering the lights
what if no one else is awake and theres no one at the wheel
they dig through compartments collecting tools
bower puts on a boom mic clips the radio on his belt and tests the transmitter
payton goes through a drawer of office supplies handing him an envelope opener
just in case
off his look theres mail you need to open quickly
bower tucks it into a zipper pocket and his photograph falls out
payton watches as he tucks it back in and zips up
i think so
must be newlyweds
how can you forget something like that
what do you remember
still a little fuzzy but youre the cocky little shit who wanted the window seat
and youre the cranky old bastard who made me take the aisle
give it some more time pal
bower squeezes inside pushing himself forward several feet as payton peeks inside behind him
with one last look bower holds the pen lamp in his teeth and begins to crawl pushing himself forward on his stomach only several inches at a time in a
grunt slide breath
grunt slide breath
paytons flashlight slowly fades from sight
slowly the sound approaches
grunt slide breath
grunt slide breath
bowers pen lamp slowly emerges and he pauses to catch his breath
with anxiety shown across his sweat coated face he squints down the endless shaft
paytons voice crackles over the radio
how we doing
christ not a single vent opening or nothing
how about on your end
payton is seated at the control desk the light panel fading
he hand cranks the auxiliary handle and then continues tapping the keys as they flicker with distortion
power surges keep coming across in longer increments just like you said
im gonna keep trying to get inside and run a dyno
or at least try to get a pizza delivered
bower frowns as he squints down the shaft
bower quickly pushes himself forward reaching an intersection in the shaft
got an intersection here
what are the choices
the light pans to endless shafts in each direction
he snaps a glow stick to life letting it drop down the vertical shaft
silently into nothing
a whole lot of the same
if youre gonna take a turn lets keep track
that way you can get back if theres no way out
dont say that
bower lowers his head breathing heavily
if you havent seen anything yet
maybe you should head back now
bower sets his jaw and suddenly spots a spider gently dropping down from a string of web
it lands and quickly scurries away
under his breath ill be damned
bower collects himself a tightened jaw of determination
im taking a left
make a note
left it is
bower turns the corner to follow the spiders path the glow of the lamp slowly fading
a wall of monitors flicker only offering a quick glance of surveillance cameras on the ship images too quick and distorted to recognize but resembling empty corridors and vast cargo
payton looks to the name plate that reads elysium and a small emblem above it a global shape with a spiral design
as he stares at the emblem it seems memories are returning a frown hardening on his face
distant thumps snap him from his trance and he pans his flashlight towards the wall
he nervously pans his light slowly up the wall and across the ceiling
a shiver of uneasiness goes through him as he sits trapped within the room alone
he tries to divert his fears turning to the control screen giving the hand crank a whirl
grunt slide breath
grunt struggle breath
bower pauses digging for his lamp
hes soaked with sweat eyes nearing desperation
pipes are cutting through the shaft on both sides making his crawl space even smaller and much more difficult
nothing but static
do you copy
filled with static im here
bower rubs the sweat from his eyes anxiety increasing with his heavy breathing
i dunno if i can i cant tell if im going in circles or theres nothing to cant breath easy pal
listen to me bower squirms pushing outward against the walls of the shaft with an increasing panic
i just want
to stand up for gods sakes
cant breath calm down
listen you gave it a shot
lets get you back here
are you kidding i cant turn around
i cant even do you know how far ive gone
take it easy bower bangs the wall of the shaft with desperation
i just want out of this fucking thing
payton is helpless listening as bower is heard on the radio starting to freak out
just listen to me
put it out of your head
stop moving and breath
listen to i cant
put your mind somewhere else like where
this may not be the best time to tell you but i got the door open
bower freezes in shock
are you fucking kidding me
im kidding you
bower lowers his head with exhaustion and a chuckle
there ya go
now just breath
well get you through this
well figure this out together
i do remember something
on the way out
there i was at the rose bowl game
naked and everyone was drunk but me
spent two years looking for clothes
long fucking rose bowl game
bower chuckles his breathing growing more steady
dream like that sounds like youve got some
you said two years
you think weve been asleep for two years
i do remember that being our duty rotation and
if were team five that means weve been out for
bower pulls the photo from his sleeve pocket shining the flashlight onto evalons image
under his breath that cant be right
what cant be
why would i leave her
i cant even remember saying good bye
why would i
payton ponders the thought while gazing at the ships emblem
well you arent here on default
this was a select pick
this flight was
were not just doing speed laps on the belt
this was something
payton gently rubs his hand across the emblem carved in the steel brushing away the layer of dust as his finger tips tremble
he pauses with a frown as a shudder approaches
the shudder is felt inside the shaft evalons photo trembling under the flashlight beam
my mother seeing me on the news
this flight was
like no other
we werent just pilots
bower looks up shining the light down the shaft as the shudder fades
he pauses to see small bolts protruding from the wall small pieces of ripped fabric and smears of blood
we were someones been through here
he pushes himself closer squeezing between pipes for a closer look
bower notices the droplets of sweat dripping off his chin are rolling forward across the shaft floor with a frown
wait a second whats wrong
im at an angle
bower panics as he begins to slide forward into a downward sloping shaft clawing at the walls
the flashlight falls rolling and sliding into the darkened abyss
he frantically tries to grip a pipe but his hand slips picking up speed
he slides head first into a vertical drop the shaft tightening like a funnel crushing his lungs and slam
he crashes into a steel grate where his flashlight lays
its a nightmarish head stand his neck twisted with all his weight on top of himself squirming with no where to squirm
the flashlight falls through the grate and he watches in horror as the light drops fading from sight taking him into darkness
payton quickly leans toward the console gripping the radio
all he can hear is the muffled panicked struggle
the rumble of a power surge approaches
bower squirms twisting and heaving inside the steel vise deathtrap
gasp gasp gasp
the rumble approaches
a shudder that sends a domino effect of metallic clanks towards him from below
small shafts of light break through as small vents open in the side walls
his fingers dig the envelope opener from his pocket as the rumble fades clanking the vents shut just as
he stabs the envelope opener into an open vent
he begins to bang his elbow against the vent over and over
he breaks the vent and kicks until hes able to push his legs through into darkness scrambling
payton is on the edge of his chair pressing the speaker to his ear
through the static comes a howl of victory
im payton breathes a heavy sigh of relief
jesus dont scare me like that
where are you
bower snaps a glow stick to life to see himself inside a small box shaped bin kneeling on top of dozens of boots
im im inside a boot locker
im inside a god damn he shoves outward and the door snaps open
he falls out flips through the air and slams to the floor an impact on the radio sends
a pop of static erupts over the speaker
bower painfully gets to his feet to see rows of storage compartments looking up to the storage bin he fell out of
make that an overhead compartment
you with me payton
i got out
he checks the transmitter crackling with static
payton adjusts the frequency with concern
do you hear me
nothing but static
bower digs into a storage bin finds another flashlight and goes to a single paneled hatch
he flips the switch and nothing
his eyes quickly search for a solution
a panel is busted open and bower jabs a pipe into the gap forcing the door open
the hydraulic pistons ignite and the hatch slides open with an echoing
he cautiously steps out into
his beam of light stabs into the darkness of the massive corridor
this is our first sense of the enormity of the ship endless steel ribbed passageways that stretch in both directions as far as the light will illuminate
he cautiously ventures down the corridor as lights flicker past getting a quick glimpse of just how incredibly far the corridors run
he steps up to an intersection of corridors adjusting the frequency on his radio
can you hear me
he sighs looking down each of the corridors all appearing identical and endless
which way is which
i he examines the piping that runs along the ceiling checking the direction of the valves and guesses picking a direction
he walks to the edge of the next corridor and pauses with a frown
glancing down the side corridor fifty yards away something is off
within the symmetrical framing of steel there is a rounded shape that is out of place
be cautiously steps closer as the object takes the shape of
a man standing at the edge of a doorway head slightly cocked peeking out
bower freezes caught in a silent stand off the mans motionless stare is unsettling
a low rumble approaches as lights flicker past to reveal
the mans face hauntingly contorted swollen features
the man is dead hanging from a cable around his neck naked and gutted like an animal his feet hanging an inch off the floor
his face is brutally beaten
jesus bower back pedals with fear and confusion as distant thumps make him quickly click off his light and he backs away fading into the dark
his whisper fades
are you there
payton is pacing back and forth while switching his radio transmitter through the channels one at a time
the familiar sound slowly returns overhead
the sounds are heard muffled and now closer then before
with the flashlight leading the way he explores into a corner of the room tangled with pipes
something is just beyond the wall trying to get in
payton back pedals searching for any form of a weapon
he snaps the handle off a storage bin wielding it like a baseball bat as he slowly back pedals to the control desk
he continues his search across the radio channels keeping his eyes toward the corner as
his fingers on the switch seem to be trembling with more intensity
can you hear me
answer me god dammit
bower forces open a single paneled hatch door and cautiously enters into an institutional style mess hall
hundreds of lunch tables and chairs
random sparks of light erupt from neon lights overhead
as he moves across the massive room the neatly lined rows gradually become more dishevelled chairs knocked over and unknown liquid dripping from the tables
garbage litters the floor a dim glow of light emerging from the galley
he crawls along the edge of the counter and peeks inside the galley horribly ran sacked
in the midst of the wreckage a darkened figure is seen scavenging through the cupboards angrily tossing empty containers aside
the figure pauses sensing a presence and glances back as
he contemplates pulling out the envelope opener and slowly peeks back out and
hes hit in the face blood spraying slamming onto his back
the pen lamp and envelope opener spin across the floor
bower tries to get up and hes grabbed by the hair a blade pressed against his neck
a womans voice growls into his ear in german
he tries to look up and
instant swelling over his eye from a hit
she kicks the envelope opener away
wait a second dont you move mother fucker
she quickly pats him down stealing tools
all he can see is her bare feet blackened from oil
he frowns to see her toe nails painted with bright pink polish
nadia a torn jump suit snarled hair hiding her face skin smeared with oil
a beautiful woman underneath an apocalyptic smear of grunge
her hair is pure white high lighted with smears of oil
wait im part of the crew
a hit silences him and the forceful frisk continues
she pauses to see evalons photograph throwing it aside
he grabs the photo and she shoves the blade deeper into his neck
just listen im not take them off
ill gut your ass alright alright
take it easy
he begins to remove his shoes and the radio on his belt suddenly crackles with activity
bower lunges and they go into a violent spin crashing over a table
dishes clatter gasps and grunts
only glimpses of the fight through the flicker of light
bowers hit sent flying and he looks up to see her silhouette approaching edged weapon in her hand
listen to me
she attacks and he frantically throws dishes and chairs to fend her off
she throws the blade the blunt end deflecting off his forearm
you crazy fucking bitch he wields the only weapon he can find
and her attack abruptly halts slowly back pedalling with fright
bower is confused realizing her eyes are looking past him
a bluish glow seeps in from the doorway approaching from the corridor
he looks back to see nadia is running for the kitchen
he ducks below the tables as a figure slowly enters the room carrying a long steel spear like device with a splinter of blinding blue fire on the tip fueled
with a chemical sprayer like a welders torch
his obstructed view reveals the figure as a tribal warrior scantily clad elongated muscular frames pale skin coated in hydraulic fluid
bald head with clumps of tangled hair
it moves smoothly and silently jabbing the tip of the flaming device into each corner and crevasse as if flushing out anything hidden
under his breath what the hell is the figure quickly spins his direction and snaps a lever on the spear device killing the blue flame and taking us instantly into
bower holds his breath with fright back pedalling on his knees as his eyes try to adjust to the dark
he takes an uneasy breath to realize
there is more then one
slowly moving out of the shadows four more hunters slowly emerge like a unified pack on the prowl
they carry an assortment of crudely made weapons spears and blades of sharpened metal
the apparent leader of the pack is heflin the largest and strongest of the group and he directs the pack with an assortment of odd vocal sounds deep hisses from
the throat and gargled cackles
on command the one hunter flips a lever and the blue flame crackles back to life with a burst of flammable liquid
the hunt continues the pack weaving through the debris following nadias path
as the bluish glow fades bower is left bewildered and terrified
suddenly his radio sounds
is that you
bower bower frantically flips it off as one of the hunters suddenly turns back
weasel a small framed hunter searches the area like a hunting dog sniffing the spot
on closer examination weasel is coated with war paint and decorative scars marking his skin
the only clear view is off an overturned bowl that shows weasels face oddly contorted in the rounded reflection
weasel is headed directly for bower until
a hiss from heflin calls him back
weasel takes one last look before turning back the torch fades from view taking us into black
bowers breath heightened gasps of fear as he begins to crawl away
sounds of the ship surround us along with the occasional flicker of light
a whispered conversation between bower and the radio slowly comes into ear shot as we find him hidden beneath a console
muffled with static with that marking shes got to be part of the passenger manifest
possibly a glitch in the lfs support system a breakdown in the main grid must have woken passengers instead of the flight crew
but why would she try to kill me
she was going to slit my throat
and why would they look like that
look like what
you should have seen these guys
a very fucked up looking gang
why the hell would they be payton they were hunting
bower gives himself a shiver as he fearfully checks over his shoulder eyes shifting with fear
they sure as shit werent a welcoming party from the promenade deck
these guys were
looking to do some damage
take it easy weve got to try to contact the bridge
youre assuming there is someone on the bridge
were not the only ones awake
team four wouldnt go back to sleep without waking us for rotation
maybe theyre on the main deck
payton goes to the doors coated with desperate scrapes and dents
if theyre in there
why havent they thrown the security hammer into lock down
seal and freeze it until the emergency units wake
maybe they cant
with the systems kicking on and off maybe theyre flying blind with no control of the lfs
payton eyes the scattered tools across the floor and the ripped open ventilation shaft
either way we cant assume help will be coming
on board or off
out here there is no rescue
there is no turning around
this thing wasnt even built
he pauses off the involuntary memory relapse looking to the i computer screens taking in the thought
what are you talking about
payton glances across the control console nodding with more memories returning
this is no regular transport
were not out collecting data off the belt or hauling cargo
we are the cargo
it was a single launch trajectory for
thats as far as his memory allows his words trailing off
bower completes his thought in a daze
planetary processing and population
were a settlers vessel
this was a one way ticket
bowers gaze goes distant as
another place another time bower leans closer on a bed watching evalon sleep
there is a a deep love in his eyes
under his breath how could i have
why would i have done that
i loved her
bower snaps out of his trance
where is your wife
we didnt leave them behind
no one did
theyre on this flight
remember the recruitment
the fucking breeding tests the wives the husbands the shes on this god damn flight
payton is remembering eyes widening with the realization not completely at ease with the thought
somewhere on board
with a new energy of determination bower crawls out of his hiding place panning the light to reveal the compartment an officers living quarters
the room is designed in a circular shape angling up the wall at a ninety degree angle
he quickly begins to search for tools and weapons
ive got to find her
before those fucking animals do
ive got to bower ransacks the compartments tossing aside items
try to think of where they would be
a sleeping compartment for non service hold it hold it
think about this for a whats there to think about
there was thousands of passengers that werent part of the development team
families that no listen to me
you know how big this ship is and theres no way of knowing exactly where if you go on some wild goose chase to try to find her
and then we would be no closer to getting out of this situation with even less time to regain control of the ship
bower stews wanting to retort his mind is racing
our job is to obtain control of this ship
once weve taken control of the systems finding them would be easy
are you hearing me
we save the ship
we can save them all
how do we i r payton where are you
panning the light i dunno
officers quarters somewhere above d level i think i dont i can guide you
find out where you are
over the door
his flashlight finds one of the hatch doors and he climbs up the slanted wall to read the marker
climbing up the angled furnishings he searches for any available weapon
he notices a mantel that displays several antique astrological and navigation devices
he spots an antique pistol
he breaks the glass grabbing the gun but it crumbles under his grip falling to pieces
he sighs but pauses to see
because the furniture is angled his light spots a hiding spot underneath the desk
he pulls out a silver flask bone dry
he reaches further pulling out an unusually shaped weapon much like a sawed off shotgun with rounded edges
he snaps open the hand crank i lever and gives a forceful whirl
a slow moan of magnetos causes the weapons lights to dimly come to life
he climbs upward to an open hatch in the ceiling as we
in the foreground there is a small fish tank completely dry with a tiny fish skeleton laying on the bottom
payton spins the hand crank allowing the computer screen to glow brighter
he quickly works the keyboard pulling up a diagram of the ship
ill lay out a path for you and see if we can by pass the main security doors
guide me to where
back toward the flight decks
back to me
im not coming back to you
what good would that do
i cant open that door from the other side what chance have you got out there on your own
well figure out a way to breach the command bridge a power surge sends a shudder and flickering lights past
the same shudder of flickering lights passes bower as he looks down the endless stretch of corridors pondering
if you can get me to the reactor bay
reset the reactors cycle
you know how to do that
if i can
we can take control of the ship
open the doors lights get on the bridge
you got a better suggestion
paytons fingers slide across the blueprints jotting down hatch numbers and markers leading to the reactor bay
sounds are heard in the walls
thump thump thump
payton is too focused on the job at hand to acknowledge them
the flashlight emerges from the dark as bower reaches an intersection checking the marker and gasping for breath
marker d x
i dont want you to go too far down that lane
just catch your i dont need a rest
i dont know vet
hold on bower backs to the wall nervously scanning the corridor struggling for breath
in the background a shadow moves at the end of the corridor
feeling uneasy bower slowly backs into a nearby compartment
bower looks across the wreckage of what was once an infirmary slash marks and battle scars from bladed weapons
through the wreckage he spots
what appears to be a window
the haze of outer space and an odd colored moon are visible
under his breath eden
payton suddenly leans forward in his chair memory sparked
what did you say
payton nods memories returning as he mumbles the name
of all things to remember why would you pick that
bower climbs through the debris towards the apparent window but its pretty far up a slanted wall and he begins to climb
im just thinking maybe theres something we havent considered
because of ods syndrome
the one officer who was suffering from pandorum
maybe there was something similar with one of the earlier no no no
youre talking about eden was lost because of a mechanical failure simple as that
a systems malfunction
bower pauses his climb looking up towards the apparent window inside what appears to be a bluish moon dotted with craters
he eagerly continues his climb growing closer
that was the report
but dont you remember the story of the one flight officer
the real story
they say he went lunar launched the entire ship five thousand people killed with the flip of a switch
all from a bad case of cabin fever
spook story along with a million others
eden was mechanical failure not human error
that was remedied way before we ever and why did they switch the rotation shifts from three years to two
and they eliminated the manual over ride they did that for obvious reasons not because of eden
within reach of the window only to realize it was an illusion
a glass compartment door left slightly ajar was reflecting a circular light panel smeared with oil to give the illusion of craters
his shoulders drop in defeat
well at least we didnt wake up
floating away in a coffin
under his breath who says we didnt
bower climbs down peering out into the corridor
something happened to the other team
maybe there was
bower looks to his own hand cradling the weapon
his fingers gently trembling
he makes a fist and shakes his hand firmly grabbing the weapon
left at the third marker
two more levels down and were there
bower heads down the corridor making a turn as
a shadowed figure steps into view slowly following his path into darkness
payton is lost in thought as he watches the computer screens slowly fade with power
he grabs the hand crank lever but pauses to hear the sounds are returning muffled and distant
he turns his light towards the ceiling and wall which almost seems to silence the sounds
the crackle of the radio snaps him from his thoughts
this cant be right whats wrong
bower is crouched in the corridor panning his light down the corridor with shifting eyes of confusion
have i done a circle or am i doubling back
why do you say that
ive seen this before
this we follow his flashlight to reveal
a body tangled in a wire snare
it appears to be the same dead body he witnessed before but as he steps closer its different
this body has ripped clothing and isnt gutted
shepard a thin framed man in a torn crew uniform tangled in a wire snare wrapped tightly under his arm and around his neck
a different one
theres booby traps rigged to the shepards eyes pop open wide with a terrified expression completely silent until bower sees him
bower jumps with fright and shepard wildly squirms screaming bloody murder
his screams echo down the corridor desperately fighting back like an animal caught in a trap
jesus im not gonna shut up
bower hits him in the gut knocking the air from his lungs
shepard crumbles wheezing for air going silent
im not gonna hurt ya
just shut the hell up
im gonna get you out of this thing
but you have to be quiet understand
shepards gaze is hollow and disturbed deeply traumatized
bower pulls on the wire thats rigged to the hydraulics of a nearby doorway shepard moans
bower you sure thats a good idea
the wire snare snaps free and shepard goes to the floor gasping
bower kneels over him to help but shepard erupts with a shriek like a hyper sensitive rape victim
bower hesitates the flashlight reveals shepards identification tattoo through the ripped uniform and blood soaked bandages
it reads flt hes
the unit thats suppose to follow us
as bower tries to wipe away blood shepard erupts again trying to scamper away from his touch
im not gonna hurt you
rd begins to moan mumbling and weeping as he rubs circulation back into his limbs with nervous laughter
you with me
youre gonna be alright
squinting past the glare of the flashlight shepard notices bowers clean uniform and the radio boom on his chin
he begins to weep tears of joy and agony
shepard thomas l
i think im the only one sir
i knew it
i knew youd be coming
wheres the rest of your squad
my lieutenant and i were the wheres the shuttle
what are you talking about
shepards expression drops
arent you the
the no no
im from this crew
im from team five
shepards face goes pale eyes going hollow
his demeanor slowly begins to shift
just woke up
maybe eight hours ago
i had to crawl all the way from the upper deck shepard seems bitterly impatient as he quickly begins gathering his tools off the floor
his eyes watch the end of the corridor now hes in a hurry
you dont have a fucking clue to whats happened
is that it
thats what were trying to figure out
tell me what happened
chuckle of disgust you know as much as i do
i dont know anything
youll fit right in
i shepard feels along the pipes until he finds one leaking oil
he vigorously begins to rub the oil onto his body
what are you doing
get the scent off
shepard rubs oil across his neck and then goes to check the corner wrapping a strap around his fist to secure a screwdriver into his hand
i cant help you
wait a second they go off scent and sound as far as i can tell and theyre a lot fucking stronger and faster they youd think
when they come
dont look back no matter what
they who the hell are they
i cant wait for you
bower is bewildered as shepard poised like a sprinter preparing to run
bower you tell this asshole the chain of command and a direct order to god dammit wait
youre still an officer of this ship and at present time your co is ordering you to ordering
for your information theres a new co on board
so fuck you and your bower shoves him against the wall with force
their struggle i freezes as distant thuds are heard down the corridor
they both look to see
the glow of blue torcfes growing
shepard begins to tremble backing away
bower sets his jaw stepping out into the corridor and slowly cranks the power lever
with a whine of magnetos raising the weapon
thats not going to help you
shepard runs as bower hesitates holding the gun towards the glow that grows brighter hisses and cackles approaching
fear over comes bower
get the hell out of there
bower turns and runs trying to follow shepard as shadowed hunters move past the end of the corridor
bower has a difficult time trying to keep up as shepard weaves through a compartment filled with filtration units and a maze of piping
bower spots a clear path but bumps into glass
he realizes the compartment is separated by thick glass dividers
he changes directions and sees shepard crawling through a vent
he tries to follow as
a blue torch moves past the doorway bare feet running across steel
a collection of hiss and cackles grow louder
bower crawls under piping to hide
he notices the activation lights on his weapon fading
and he quietly tries to give the energy lever a few turns
but the whine seems too loud
he spots shepard twenty feet away hidden behind a console
i they exchange a look and shepard angrily waves him away
dont follow me
i cant help you shank
a wire noose snaps tight around shepards neck
much like a pole and wire rig used to wrangle alligators the wire is released from the rig and shepard bursts into a wild frenzy trying to run while on
a thirty foot long leash
the wire loops and tangles around the piping as
hunters move in from every direction blades whirling
shepards scream intensifies as the hunters huddle over him
bower viciously cranks the energy lever on the weapon and climbs out of his hiding place as
screams intensify within the brutal attack as the hunters begin to feed
seepards neck is twisted far enough to snap
i bower raises the gun towards the back of the lead hunter only fifteen feet away
he pulls the trigger and rusted metal screeches
he panics grabbing the gun with both hands checking for a safety switch and
the weapon discharges a tremendous blast of energy off to the side
the weapon is designed to destroy biological and organic material but for safety precautions its unable to penetrate man made materials like lead glass or steel
its unable to puncture the ships hull
the energy blast is an electrical discharge that cracks like lightening and echoes like thunder
the blast hits the side of the wall with a deafening ripple of aftershocks shattering anything fragile and knocking over anything not fastened down within a thirty foot radius
this little thing packs a punch
the hunters turn towards bower the lead hunter turning to reveal itself as
heflin a muscular frame larger then the rest skin glistening with a layer of hydraulic fluid along with tribal i scars and distorted war paint
his eyes hidden under shadow
he slowly lifts his shoulders while lowering his head much like the fluid motions of a reptilian predator
bower frantically cranks the energy lever and raises it toward heflin completely unaffected by the threat
he squeezes the trigger and
the gunshot is thunderous hitting the unseen glass divider between them
the safety glass absorbs the blast sending a shudder through the hull
heflin barely flinches stepping closer with a hiss
off his command the hunters take chase swarming in every direction searching for a route around the glass divider
bower runs for his life
payton jumps to his feet eyes darting across the flickering monitors gripping the radio
answer me god dammit
all that is heard is gargled static and panicked breathing
bower is running like a madman ricochetting off doorways and tripping over pipes in the darkness
they got him
they fucking ripped him apart
theyre dont look back
bower finds an open corridor and sprints as
blades scrape across metal blue
torches roar hisses echo
bower gasps heavily hyper ventilating as he catches glimpses of hunters on his trail and running parallel in adjacent corridors closing in with unnatural agility and speed
theyre i he runs through a doorway and a thin metal strip hits him in the legs
wires snap and hydraulics moan
hitting the booby trap at full speed causes the wire to rip out of the door frame and
bower tumbles as the wire loops around his leg and he falls off the edge of a loading shaft into an open elevator shaft that drops into darkness
the wire tightens and hes swung by the foot back into an open corridor two floors below like a demented base jumper
he slams into the ceiling and spins wildly over the open shaft as his transmitter falls all the way to the bottom exploding on impact
the radio static instantly changes to a hiss
payton looks to the meters
bower grabs the wall to stop from spinning and frantically pulls on the wire around his leg as it rips through his skin
footsteps are heard approaching overhead
on the floor below him are his weapon and flashlight
he stretches for the gun
too far from his reach
the flashlight is on illuminating the area
he pushes off the wall and reaches for it
fingers touching but unable to grab it
the glow of torches grows in the loading shaft and bower pushes off reaching for the flashlight
unable to retrieve it instead he pushes it
into the open loading shaft
it drops all the way to the bottom as
hunters step up to the edge of the shaft looking down to see the flashlight fall from sight
bower swings back grabs the wall and freezes
the hunters hear the flashlight hit the bottom of the shaft and then slowly double back
bowers face fills with blood as he hangs upside down trying to catch his breath
his grip is weakening as he looks up to see
a shadowed figure crouched with a spear in hand leering at him from the shadows approaching
with no time to defend himself and no where to go
the cable is violently tugged from above jerking bower upward pulling him away from the wall
he spins wildly trying to grab back onto the wall as
the cable yanks bower upwards with enough force to hit the ceiling and swing toward the open shaft
his fingers claw at the wall as hes literally being reeled in like a fish
he sees the figure charging with a bladed spear
hes knows hes done for and
the wire is slashed bower breaks free hitting the floor as the cable is jerked up and out of sight
the silhouettes of the hunters on the ledge several levels above inspect the loose cable and after a hiss they turn back fading into the shadows
bower lays on his back squirming in the tangled wire as the figure hovers over him spinning a bladed weapon in his hand
dont please listen the figure slashes bowers sleeve rips away the fabric and looks at his identification tattoo
bower quits squirming as the figure leans closer into the light with a curious frown
tanaka a japanese man in ripped and modified clothing
unlike the awkward gauntness of the hunters he has a full framed hard edged physique and soft brown eyes
japanese no subtitles what
japanese no subtitles i dont understand
i i dont speak tanaka jabs a finger into the emblems on bowers uniform
japanese no subtitles im sorry
i dont do you
japanese no subtitles they share a nod and an awkward silence bower still eyeing the razor sharp weapon in his hand and not wanting to move
tanaka is dead pan
bower flinches as tanaka picks up the energy gun and then
flips it over handing it back to him
bower cautiously accepts as he climbs to his feet
japanese no subtitles im sorry
japanese no subtitles i dont know what you tanaka jabs the emblem on his uniform and presents his own identification tattoo that reads agr
matter of factly japanese no subtitles
listen im not tanaka jabs the emblem on bowers chest taps his tattoo
japanese no subtitles yes
im with the flight crew
but i dont know whats happened
i another jab
realizing louder doesnt mean clearer bower sighs at his own idiocy
tanaka nods but with obviously no clue what was just said
they stare at one another in silence
tanaka hands him a flashlight
bower does his best charades gesturing to himself and pointing to the ship
listen im going to find out what went wrong
with the ship
yes im going to the reactor to try to ree actoh
it doesnt really matter you should stay put
or go back to your compartment sector wait for the security systems to engage
were gonna take care of this problem
bower slowly backs away and tanaka follows
bower stops i eyeing his numerous bladed weapons
listen you should stay
for the systems to alright
tanaka frowns as bower backs away gesturing
bower reaches the next intersection and looks back
tanaka is gone
he continues down the corridor as lights flicker past
payton is coated with sweat viciously pounding on the locked doors with a heavy pipe
its obviously having no effect and he collapses with exhaustion and frustration
lowers his head and slowly
the sounds return
like a dripping faucet of annoyance payton bitterly turns his flashlight quickly towards the corner
wielding the heavy pipe he cautiously approaches
his flashlight pans up the wall to the ventilation shaft
that cant be
you the sounds remain muffled deeper within the wall possibly from inside the ventilation shaft
payton contemplates eyes panicked
he climbs up the wall and wedges the panel cover over the shaft opening jamming it closed with a screwdriver
he backs away gripping the weapon ready for anything
he tries to control his breathing as he sits
a blood droplet hits the floor by his feet and payton wipes blood off his nose with confusion and a nervous frown
a pin point of light appears at the end of a circular tunnel
slowly the light grows as bower approaches and cautiously steps through a doorway and into
a rec room with several rows of pool tables video games and a ran sacked bar
the floor is heavily littered with broken glass and bower wipes his finger across a wet surface on the bar tasting it with an eye brow raised
he climbs over the bar checks numerous cabinets only to find more broken glass and emptied containers
about to give up he pops open the last cabinet and
a figure lunges out a direct hit under his jaw sends him backwards over a table
the figure jumps on top of him jabbing a blade toward his neck
he grabs the wrist just as the tip begins to dig into his throat
a quick struggle ensues and just as bower is about to be sliced open
the attacker is hit and sent flying
tanaka has come to his rescue twirling a pipe across his palms
the attacker rolls to her feet to reveal
she snatches a pool ball off the table and throws it directly into tanakas chest
she rolls across the floor grabbing her knife and
bower blinds her with his flashlight raising the gun with a quick whirl of the energy lever laser sights flaring brightly
bower ducks as a broken bottle whizzes past his face smashing against the wall
he raises the gun and
a deliberate warning shot goes past nadia and hits the bar shattering every piece of glass thats near by and nadia and tanaka are both blown off their feet
knock it off
both of ya
tanaka and nadia slowly recover both quickly try to find their weapons on the floor
nobody needs to get hurt here
both of you just
and stop throwing that shit
her eyes dart with uneasiness as she finds her knife
lets all just
go easy here
i understand its been every man for himself around here lately but if were going to get out of this a little god damn solidarity wouldnt hurt
we can work together here
we all want the same thing
nadia remains poised ready to fight knife raised
sighing with defeat bower gestures hands raised as he motions for tanaka and they slowly back towards the door
motioning to tanaka thanks
tanaka motions toward the emblem on his uniform and gestures to himself
i get it
we can work together on this right
as long as we understand each other
they head out of the room as
nadia watches from the shadows with a curious frown
bower and tanaka head down the corridor both of them checking their backs as they come to a sealed doorway
tanaka is still wincing rubbing his chest with pain
japanese no subtitles yeah
well no sympathy here
she left me with a few sore spots too pal
they both go to work attempting to wedge the door open with pipes
bower looks back to see
they back pedal with weapons in hand and nadia is unaffected watching them with a frown
we dont want any who the hell are you
part of the flight crew
a corporal im i didnt think there was any flight crew left
whats happened to us
thats what im trying to figure out
malfunction of some sort gee you think
where are you going
im heading for the reactor bay
you just wake up
just joining the program already in progress yeah
she eyes him over and tanaka keeps the pipe raised
youll never make it
and why is that
youre going the wrong direction
she grimaces and turns heading back up the corridor
bower and tanaka exchange a look
bower chases after her
wait a second hey
keep it down hold on
who are you
wait cant join the team without a name
why would i want to join
because i need you to show me the way
to the reactor
dont like going that fax down
no one ever comes back
she continues up the corridor and bower grabs her arm
she yanks away from his touch squaring off weapon in hand
please theres not much time left before we lose everything onboard
you understand what im trying to do you know where this ship is headed
im working on it
can you fly it
can you fly it
if you have to
nadia eyes him over sizing him up
ill get you as close to it as i can
but i wont wait for you
bower nods with a frown and she heads up the corridor
bower and tanaxa watch on
japanese no subtitles
my thoughts exactly
lights flicker past as
nadia leads them down a long corridor that widens into an atrium of shafts going into the darkness in every direction
the further their lights pan across the shafts
a strange assortment of odd colored algae and moss is revealed growing up the walls of the shafts
tanaka keeps a watchful eye as bower frowns at the surroundings
you know where youre going
how long have you been awake
theres no way to tell time in here
maybe three months
his voice echoes across the cavernous atrium and she glares quiet
you wanna get us killed
how could you have you telling me people have been running around on board for several months
i wasnt the first one up
their flashlight beams continue across the enormous room like two small searchlights
she leads them down into a side shaft their lights fade from view
nadia stops at the foot of a large steel door gesturing for them to crouch in the shadows watching the corridor
where are we going
what are we doing i shush
waiting for what
at the far end of the corridor a faint bluish glow grows stronger
shadows are moving growing closer
nadia gestures for them to stay put
tanaka wants to leave but bower grabs his shoulder
they both grip weapons glancing to nadia as the hunters seem to be headed their way
the hiss and cackles of the hunters grow closer and it seems theyre shortly going to be cornered and done for until
a shudder is felt a flicker of lights approaching
she goes to a control panel holds down a switch and presses her palm f across a scanner
as the power surge passes the control panel activates scanning her hand and the steel door activates with a moan of hydraulics
bower notices her id tattoo bio t
the shudder passes killing the power and the door stops
open only a half foot
she squeezes through and bower and tanaka quickly follow
they help her push it shut sealing the lock with a clank
nadia secures the lock on the door and jams a pipe in the handles her own added insurance
who are they
what the hell are those things
shaking her head never quite felt like sticking around to find out
is always the best option
theyre not they cant be from this ship
they dont seem
do you think something got on board or maybe i something
he turns to follow her and pauses to see
the bio vault
a large lab storage compartment that has been lived in for a long time
a bed has been created from assorted chair cushions and there is a collection of scavenged items
nadia adds to the items dumping the belongings of her bag onto the floor
bower is in awe as he approaches an entire wall of glass test tubes a maze of micro biological containers glimmering with condensation
ecological development embryonic charter
livestock and wildlife re population
the rows of glass tubes are labelled ranging from mountain goats to octopi everything a new world would need
nadia checks a few gauges on the wall of tubes and makes adjustments on the monitoring system
he senses her meticulous care for the material
youve been living in here
it seems to be the only living thing left on this ship worth protecting
regardless of the situation we still have a mission
weve only lost about thirty percent of the specimens mostly reptilian class
never was big into snakes anyway
bower doesnt share the attempt at humor wandering towards a darkened digital screen on the wall displaying a charted graph of the new planet tanis
under his breath tanis
off his look you couldnt remember
no i i didnt remember just how far away it is
this was a hundred and twenty three year flight
nadia begins to gather a few items shoving them into a bag
tanakka leans closer to the glass display with fascination tapping the tubes to see movement inside
how could i have forgotten that
it comes only in pieces
even after a few months
i know everything about this vault and its systems
but i still cant remember where i grew up
or my brothers name
and the training comes back first
for good reason i guess
bower eyes the darkened computer terminals portions of the consoles coated in algae
how could we have become like this
in only eight years
nadia ponders the thought rotating her jaw
she digs into her supplies and tosses him a small block of orange material
what is this
i save em for the weekends
bower sniffs it with a sneer and tries to break off a piece
hard as a rock
do you know how long it would take to turn dehydrated meatloaf into that
i dont know but it takes more then a couple years to turn coal into fucking diamonds
you think weve over slept
this ship was built to outlast our childrens children
and any engineer could tell ya the warranty is running out
i think weve been asleep longer then you may think
bower tosses the orange brick
to tanaka and he sniffs it with a grin breaking off a piece
nadia finishes gathering tools and she slings the bag over her shoulder ready to go
do you have a radio
shaking her head who the hell is there to call
im not the only flight crew officer awake
were not in this alone
payton is asleep seated on the floor back to the wall
he is awoken by
he instantly grips the pipe and turns on the flashlight
the sounds are closer then ever before as something is heard crawling towards the panel in the ventilation shaft
a vent panel lightly rattles the metal begins to bend
you want in
come and get it you fu the screwdriver snaps and the panel hits the floor
payton raises the pipe preparing to fight and
a desperate gasp is heard from inside the shaft
payton pauses angling the light inside to see
gallo a young flight officer boyish innocence short cropped hair heavily coated in sweat desperation in his eyes
his hair is dark brown the only person without pure white hair
who the hell
gallo is tightly wedged inside the shaft squirming to crawl out trembling with fear and exhaustion
help me im part of the flight crew
im please help me
payton oddly hesitates
before lowering the weapon
he digs into the shaft grabbing gallos hand pulling him out
gallo collapses onto the floor crumbling into a fetal position naked
his hands are locked in claw like grips trembling uncontrollably
his gasps are rapid and unsteady
youre all right
payton runs to grab a towel and water
as he turns back he notices gallos hip and legs are sprayed with dried blood
payton kneels over him and gallo spasms from his touch
im here to help you
payton lifts the bottle to his lips but the water runs down his face gallo is frozen in shock
try to drink a little
gallo is unresponsive wide eyes locked in a trance
whats your name
can you hear me
payton frowns mumbling the name with a hint of recognition
where did you come from gallo
saying the words seems to send him into a terrified trance
where are we
can you tell me
the more payton inquires the more gallo begins to unravel emotionally
his eyes widen with terror breath quickening
gallo is hyper ventilating eyes wide with terror
a droplet of blood slowly builds in his nostril refusing to drip
a low whine is heard in his throat as
lights flicker past
a hatch is broken open and bowers flashlight beam peers into a ventilation shaft
twenty feet inside the shaft the walls are collapsed blocking passage
nadia sighs with dread
we cant get through this way
id prefer to stay on foot
its the safest way to travel
and theres only one other way to get through that i know of
and what is that
light breaks through as our gang wedges open a door all sneering in unison when hit by an odor
where are we
hyper sleep chamber personnel
keep your light down
she leads the way along the wall and into a compartment of unimaginable size fifty foot high steel walls that channel through the room
the walls are lined with hundreds of sleep chambers stacked ten high on either side
they round a corner into the main atrium to see dishevelled equipment and smashed control consoles scarred from battle
old blood stains are worn deeply into the floor
as they venture deeper inside they see numerous sleep chambers open hatches and empty
the further they move along the wall more and more empty pods too many to count
theyre all where the hell is everyone
as the dozens and dozens of nameplates move past his flashlight bower pauses
wait a second
my wife keep moving
my wife could be in here
bowers focus completely shifts turning towards the pods reading name plates
what does she do
whats her specialty
shes not part of the crew but spouses were brought with
i remember there were then shes not in here
this is development settlers
nadia quickly continues as bower tries to keep up
do you know where the family members are
they look to see tanaka has fallen behind crouched and peering off towards the dark
hes poised like a dog on the prowl thats caught a bad scent
they crouch and crawl to the adjacent corner
i dont see what hes looking at do you
we have to keep moving
we dont want to stay out in the open for too long
especially in here
distant thumps are heard somewhere in the room and they tighten up with their weapons eyes scanning
tanaka refuses to look away poised like a hunter
we cant stay herel nadia heads across the main floor and bower tries to wave him on but tanaka is locked onto something refusing to waver
lets get out of here
comon the thumps grow louder and tanaka heads into the shadows
bower hesitates turning to follow nadia through a barricade of dishevelled equipment leaving tanaka behind
bower emerges from the barricades into a processing center for loading passengers darkened and in shambles
nadia is scanning the corridors ahead choosing her path as bower rushes to catch her
we cant just leave him
we have to wait then you wait
and find your own way
we cant split up the team its all i told you im not going to wait
im not gonna get myself killed for the guy saved my life twice already
im not gonna leave him what do you think hes doing in there
how the hell should i know hes hunting
bagging the next notch on his belt
you wait for him
i nadia quickly heads deeper into the room and down a darkened and narrowing tunnel
bower hesitates with frustration
having to choose he turns and chases after nadia
i they crawl through a maze of machinery and nadias pace is difficult for bower to keep up
im coming theres a crunch under his foot
he lowers his light picking up a small white object
he brings it closer to the light to realize its
a human finger bone
nadia turns toward him to see
behind bower is a massive stack of human skeletons and carcasses
theyve just crawled into a pit of human remains
they both back away with horror only to see a mountain of carcasses on both sides
the only route is upward and they begin to crawl up the slope on their bellies over dead remains
wait where are we going
nadia suddenly grabs him a quick jerk to silence him
a shadow passes with a cackling hiss
they freeze laying on top of the remains the bones crinkling underneath them
the hiss grows stronger
and they look up to see a silhouetted hunter crouched over like a gargoyle on a rafter leering in their direction
they try to remain motionless but the slope of the remains i crinkles underneath them and the hill of remains begins to slide
the hiss grows stronger
they hold their position until
a shudder approaches with flickering lights
the power surge is enough to ignite a small landslide underneath them
nadia grabs his arm as bones snap and they slide helplessly to the bottom within a landslide of bones and flesh
the finally slide to a stop at the bottom of the slope and bower quickly raises his weapon towards the rafters to see
the hunter is gone
did it go
he pans the light and
the hunter lunges at them from five feet away
bower is struck with enough force to send him flying crashing into a pile of bones
nadia spins around with a bladed pipe in her hands
but the hunter is already gone
she spins back and
shes hit from behind and sent with break neck force into the floor
the hunter pounces onto her back and a claw like hand grabs her hair
teeth opening towards her neck and
bower charges into the hunter tackling it and they spin into a brutal and distorted fight seen under the flickering light
even though the hunter is a smaller one of the pack smaller then bower its speed and strength is in human
it grabs bower by the head with a growl and
tanaka lunges out of the shadows delivering a blow with his bladed pipe into the hunters face
its a hit that would normally kill anything nearly taking its head off
the hunter stumbles staggers and
it hits tanaka sending him airborne nearly knocking him out
under the flickering light bower nadia and tanaka all attack the lone hunter taking all three of them to bring it to the floor
they viciously pound it with pipes and blades until it finally stops flinching beneath them
its pale white skin seeps a thick black colored blood
the three of them back away gasping and coated in its blood
christ jesus its face is smashed beyond recognition but its facial features are horrifically distorted no sign of eyes under the shredded tissue
what the hell is it
the hunter flinches and our gang back pedals with fright
nadia continues back pedalling looking towards the rafters to see
heflin silhouetted leering towards them
bower quickly finds his weapon on the floor and heflin slowly begins to tap his spear against the wall echoing a continual clank through the hull
what is he
bower nadia and tanaka quickly realize the effect as shadows begin to move
the room is filling with hunters alerted by the tapping of metal
a low gargled hiss is heard from heflins throat
nadia is already gone
bower and tanaka chase after her as the walls come to life hunters swarming onto their path like a pack of wild dogs
before diving through the barricade bower looks back to see heflin and his pack have paused
to eat the fallen hunter
its a panicked and mad dash through the dark as they crawl through the barricade and run back into the main corridor of sleep chambers
hunters can be heard closing on their trail
they round a corner and nadia jumps inside an empty sleep chamber frantically trying to pull the hatch closed
tanaka follows suite jumping inside another chamber and bower scrambles in search of an open door as footsteps are heard quickly approaching
in a frenzied panic bower dives into the chamber with nadia tugging the hatch closed
bower and nadia are cheek to cheek in the cramped space both gasping for breath and dripping sweat with terror
through the porthole
silhouetted hunters move past with weapons in hand search and destroy style
one hunter steps up only a few feet from their porthole and they freeze holding their breath
slowly the hunters continue past the shadows slowly fading from sight
what the hell happened to them
what the hell are those things
they listen for a long moment
hearing nothing as bower looks at his hand finger tips trembling
the hatch door inches open and bower peeks out
he and nadia crawl out quietly to see tanaka waiting for them
japanese no subtitles
i second that
lets get the fuck out of here
which way did we come from
you want to go back
no i mean
lets just go
we should go back
find a different path
i dont think we can get through to the reactor bay from you said there was no other path
im ready to explore other options which way did they go
you really want to discuss it here
a rumble is heard approaching and they all crouch in unison
its a power surge that sends flickering lights across the massive corridor and a blinking light is activated on a nearby sleep chamber
the hatch door is kicked from the inside white gas erupting from the seam
our gang quickly crawls toward the shadows crouching behind equipment to watch as
another kick bursts open the hatch and a big passenger crawls out slamming onto the floor with a shiver of agony gasping for breath muscles twitching
the big passenger tries to get to his feet gasping and heaving mumbling in russian
bower tries to stand but nadia pulls him back
what are you doing
theyll hear him theyll weve got to footsteps thunder across the floor and
the big passenger is struck by a single blow from heflin
the hunters have returned in full force and they come out of the shadows from every direction bladed weapons spinning
bower pulls away from nadias grip and prepares to intervene but tanaka suddenly grabs him holding him back with force
with the big passenger wounded and moaning on the floor the hunters gather in a circle in ceremonial fashion praying thanks for the feast the ship has presented
they watch helplessly as the big passenger is then brutally attacked and eaten alive
weasel leads other hunters under the flickering light in a demented and twisted celebratory dance a frenzy of pure evil
this attack is heard more then it is seen under flickering lights obscured view and most of the camera angles on bower and the groups reactions
frozen in horror bower is tugged by tanaka following nadia to the corner where shes lifted a grate in the floor
they climb into a shaft under the floor and into the dark as
the screams and hisses echo through the hull
payton is seated at the control desk scrolling across radio frequencies talking softly into the boom mic
do you copy
you out there
he sighs and glances toward gallo passed out on a nearby bunk
he hesitates holding the pipe as a weapon tucking it away and cautiously approached gallo for a closer inspection
he feels his neck for a pulse
he notices the dried blood under his nose then gently pulls aside the blanket to see gallos identification tattoo reading flt
frowning to himself team four
he glances up to see gallo is now awake staring at him
what are you doing
gallo narrows his eyes pulling the blanket tighter
to make sure youre
you who the hell are you
youre team four
youre suppose to be
gallo deepens his frown glancing around with disorientation
you came from the bridge
gallo shifts his eyes back on him a bad topic
where are we
i cant get guidance off this system and i have no idea where
i dont know
well what did you see
how did listen im not a navigator
stars all look alike
i dont know
how the hell would i know
sensing gallo is about to break down again payton tries a calmer approach
i just want to make sure
gallos hands are trembling uncontrollably
youre okay gallo tucks his shaking hands under the blanket defensively
payton lowers his stare hesitating glancing across the dried blood still splattered across his legs
is this your blood
some of it is
whose blood is it
galloholds his stare jaw muscles tightening
they didnt give me any choice
there was something wrong with them
i something was wrong with who
off his stare he understands the implication
off his look of the worst sort
they were i couldnt even i had to defend myself
both of them
you dont believe me
i believe you
payton goes to a nearby compartment popping open a first aid case inside is a pistol gripped syringe
he turns back and gallo squares off clenched fists
what are you doing
what is that
its just a sedative
help you relax gallo lifts his fists with a threatening posture
then you take it
payton backs off setting the syringe aside
take it easy
were on the same team here
payton turns back to the control console and continues his search across the radio frequencies
he discreetly pulls the pipe weapon closer to his seat
gallo holds a hollow stare on the back of his head
if you would have seen them
you would have done the same thing
lights flicker past
a flicker of light passes to reveal
bower crouched inside a three foot high narrow passageway a crawl space beneath a steel grated floor
he follows the tunnel into a large silo lined with octagonal filters
tanaka and nadia are both looking for a way out jabbing pipes into the grate overhead unable to budge it
didnt we come through here already
we gotta find a way out
why did we come iii
i was trying to get us out of there alive i thought you knew where you were going
i was trying to save our asses couldve mentioned that after the first mile
if i would have known wed be doing laps down here she angrily turns towards him pipe in her hand
i didnt need to help you at all
you and the hong kong express would still be playing ding dong ditch on level eight if it werent for me
their heightening confrontation is halted by
and whispered japanese
they pause to hear
classical music echoing from below
what the hell is that
they climb down the shaft jumping from filter to filter
at one level they follow the sound into a shaft opening and towards the soft warm glow of yellow light
they reach an open hatch peering inside to see
inside an empty storage tank a comfortable living space has been created numerous chairs surround a make shift dinner table made from storage crates with hand made candles and various
the tank appears empty
what is this
bower and tanaka begin to climb through and nadia hesitates with uncertainty
they crawl through the hatch
they climb into the empty tank lined with valves and filtration screens
the music is playing from crackling speakers hidden in the darkened circular catwalk overhead
tanaka goes straight for the food and as soon as nadia steps through the hatch
a wire snaps
levers clank and a mouse trap has triggered
slamming the hatch closed
they instantly turn back to the door yanking and tugging in a panic
bower pans his light towards the catwalk only to see a figure leland scampering through the shadows
another lever is turned and
a stream of vapor shoots out of several vents along the wall
the colorless gas hits them and they instantly gag choking for air
with the slanted walls of the tank there seems to be no escape but tanaka runs up the wall diving and grabbing onto a pipe climbing upward toward the catwalk
the shadowed figure leland quickly hobbles to the railing
no no no
back in der big boy
leland uses a spear to jab tanakas hand
he loses his grip and tumbles back to the bottom of the tank
bower pulls nadir out of the way of the hatch
bower whirls the magneto lever on the weapon and he raises the barrel towards the hatch nearly point blank
the energy blast from the weapon hits the hatch like a lightening bolt sending a tremendous jolt through the entire tank
a spark ignites the chemical gas and theres a burst of flammable gas that rolls upward into the catwalks
leland is knocked off his feet and he gasps with shock
what the hell was that
leland is exposed from his hiding place waving the smoke from his face bewildered
hes an older man whos lost all vanity over survival
a thin framed spidery little man with assorted clothing and a clutter of tools on his belt
what did you do
bower whirls the lever on the weapon and points it at him
shut off the gas
where did you get that
bower angles the barrel towards a vent blowing out the chemical gas and leland jumps with fright
leland scampers across the catwalk and quickly lifts levers and twists nozzles shutting off the flow of chemical gas
his frown transforms to a grin raising an eye brow as he stares into the barrel of bowers weapon
fancy looking piece
looking to trade
clickity clickity clank
leland cranks an energy lever that ignites a string of auxiliary lights around the tank widening their view of the unusual living space
several crates and an assortment of mechanical junk and supplies
make yerselves at home
just throw the coats on the bed and dont pet the rat its not mine
just watching it for a friend
leland is excited to have guests as he runs along the catwalks lighting candles and sealing valves
they watch him with leery suspicion weapons still in hand
got a roomier flat in the bow for the off season but from here ya just cant beat the commute
he grins expecting a laugh but doesnt get one
leland eyes bower over admiring the uniform
you really a flyer or did ya grab that off the rack
i didnt think there was any crew left
have you seen any
well only the captain
informally mind you
umm up on b deck
some on c
a few pieces on the promenade and i think his nuts are in the foose ball game in the rec room
he smiles revealing several missing teeth
no one laughs
grab a bunk
three singles or will a queen do
leland laughs to himself digging through supplies
bower scans the walls seeing no way up to the catwalks
why dont you come on down so we can meet properly
oh no no
no can do
im real touchy to the dust bug and who knows where yawl have been
theres something funky going around
but dont let that spoil the party
leland lowers down a bin filled with assorted food items using a wire to drop it to them
tanaka sniffs it with suspicion
bower peeks through one of the valves turning to nadia
where do you think we are
i dont know
gotta be somewhere below b deck
why where you gotta be
the reactor bay
know where it is
now why would you want to go down there
you just woke up didnt cha
a small propane flame is lit
leland hovers over a make shift stove heating a can of water
he pours in some powder and stirs it up with the meticulous nature of a chef preparing fine cuisine
its tough to properly season with a motor oil base
but if you use your imagination kinda tastes like
herb and garlic dog shit
below the catwalks tanaka has found a spot to rest nadir is using water to clean a wound and bower is peering through a slit in a vent
how long have you been awake
whats today tuesday
that would be about mmm
he counts in his head and across his fingers carefully calculating then a grin
he turns back to his make shift stove chuckling to himself
i quit counting after the band broke up ooooh twenty
thirty years ago
bower and nadir exchange a look of uncertainty
the classical music begins to skip and without even looking leland kicks a piece of equipment correcting the music
then again an hour in this place feels more like
one fifteen one twenty
know whatta i mean
ha hp w
not naming names but im writing a very strongly worded letter to the airline
leland chuckles nodding to tanaka
but i just treat each day like its christmas
festive and violent
lets eat shall we
who needs a bib
leland sets several bowls of soup into the bin and lowers it to them with the cable
t anaka is the only one interested sniffing the soup with a glare
bower takes a seat showing exhaustion and defeat
those things out there
could it have been something
that crawled out of your lab
something that no
then something got on board
some kind of life form
something that or something that was already on board with us in the hyper bunks
what does that mean
it could have been the accelerator
its the only theory i can come up with
the synthetic enzyme in our feeding tubes
the accelerator that would help our bodies adjust and adapt to the environmental conditions on tanis
from what ive seen
these things have adapted
to the ship instead
but why would youre saying well become like them
why would they be affected like that and were not i dont know
like i said its the only theory i can think of unless
gallos gaze is hollow and translucent as he stares through the glass porthole in the empty sleep chamber his mind is deeply pondering
gallo is looking at the empty sleep chambers while payton remains at the control console determined not to give up on contacting bower
do you know the symptoms of pandorum
orbital dysfunctional syndrome
ever witnessed the symptoms of first hand
ive seen it before
but nothing that its not something you can easily detect
starts with a shiver
a slow boil
and without being able to get off the ship
theres no shutting off the heat
itll boil over no matter what you do
gallo is slowly pacing the room and payton watches him with uneasiness out of the corner of his eye
you dont believe me
i didnt say that how could they both have had it
the odds are insurmountable
i wasnt about to question any of your
but we all know pandorum is greatly affected by any substantial psychological it has an emotional trigger effect
off his look thats what they say
gallo slowly rubs his temples with hesitation
how do you think you would react
if you knew the truth
leland flips on dim flood lights illuminating the upper walls of the tank where
like ancient cave drawings a i story has been crudely sketched out along the wall of the tank
leland lurks through the shadows telling the tale with a campfire spook story flare of dramatics
oh how the world cheered to the thunder of its mightiest creation
the heaven for heroes to venture further and farther then any of mans machine dared before it
bower and nadia watch intently as tanaka lazily sips the soup
the first image is off the ships launch and leland hobbles across to the crudely sketched image of three figures flight officers
three of our bravest
atop the watch tower as we slept
a slumber deeper then any have dared
with only three little indians left to mind the store
gallo slowly unravels his own tale as payton watches on with suspicion and caution
we were only into our second term
all flight systems nominal
id picked up on symptoms with my co and nd lieutenant
nothing i thought would
become a problem
until we got the transmission
gallos eyes are welling up his lip begins to shiver
the final transmission
the last message
leland continues across his wall drawings the three pilots pictured receiving a radio call
until the last cry from home
all of gods creation
ending with mere words of encouragement
mother earths last call
leave a message momma
leland presses a switch on a jerry rigged piece of equipment a disc player
speakers crackling with static
a voice plays heavily distorted
hoove arr awl dadz efft ah uz
bood uck boogz guezz
ab hoobz deeb
bower and nadia are now completely engrossed in the story both getting to their feet and walking closer to hear
tanaka is asleep
leland is thrilled by their attention doing a dance as he plays the recording
over and over
hoove err all wadz efft ah uz
good wuck boogz guezz
abb hoobz deeb
what is that
leland cranks a power lever speeding up the play back with eagerness whispering along
the recording slowly grows less distorted the more he cranks the lever
yoove are all watt efft of uz
good uck gog besh
ab gogz deez
you are all whadz left of uz
and gogs sbeeb
and gogz speeb
slowly lelands whisper and the recording come into unison eerily echoing through the tank
you are all thats left of us
good luck god bless
and gods speed
leland and the recorder echo throughout the tank as
gallo matches the echo with
you are thats left of us
good luck god bless
and gods speed
gallo puffs across his hand with twisted amusement
we ran a full sweep off the grid and they were
one day there the next
in one day
it had to be nuclear or
whatever it was they knew it was coming
wished us well
were all thats left
payton sits back in shock shaking his head in disbelief
oh my god
you can see why i was hesitant
to tell even you
my fellow crew members didnt take the news too well
i wanted to wake the primary crew
but my nd lt was already over the edge
ods came through with flying colors
no logic no reasoning left
no future no past no hope
a dangerous mix when youre stuck inside a tin can like this
the blow was more then he could handle
my lieutenant wasnt far behind
leland moves past a wall drawing of earth destroyed moving to the image of the three pilots
three little indians with the burden to bare
no more law and nothing left to care
three poor souls destiny undone
chop chop chop
now theres only one
the sketches reveal violence between the three pilots two of them killed one remaining alive
gallos hands are beginning to tremble as he struggles through the story
they were my commanding officers
men who had guided me through ft
i looked up to these men
it wasnt them anymore
i had no choice
i with his body beginning to tremble payton tries to console him touching his arm
leland continues across the wall drawings showing the one remaining pilot all alone aboard the massive ship
one little indian left
all alone with his doom
refused to go to bed stayed up to play in his room
oh and what naughty little games he would play with the slumbering prey
slayer master both god and the devil some would say
the boy would grow to manhood a self proclaimed king ruler of his vessel home to his own sin
the sketches show the lone pilot torturing and devouring passengers from their sleep chambers as he grows old
and then one day the king cast out all those who had behaved exiled into the barren cargo holds to fend for themselves
scavenging against the others within their own domain
the sketches show tortured victims forced out into the corridors of the ship the king returns to his sleep chamber
king lonely no longer wanted to play
he yearned to see the morning sun on a tanis day
he returned to his bed of slumber waiting for the day
but the survivors lived on as the king slept a whole new world of evil grew as we wept
the seed driven beyond you want me to back up
play that transmission again
i want save yer questions til the end please
well have a review
leland continues his performance as nadia leans toward bower with concern
could that be real
you think that could i dunno
it cant be it just
bower is quickly growing drowsy slurring his words as he takes a seat with exhaustion and disbelief
nadir rests her chin on her knee
eyes growing heavy as leland continues telling the tale softly like a childs bedtime story
leland takes a peace of chalk like material drawing a new sketch
and now the newest chapter comes to us
three weary travelers guided by the light
the new brave flyer woken by the dying machine
he sketches bower and his journey towards the reactor
a gallant knight who will wake the fiery beast light the rockets torch that will sail our mighty ship to port
a new king to deliver us to paradise
hail to the new king
leland looks to see
everyone is asleep
he adjusts a nozzle that
is pumping a colorless gas out of the vents at the bottom of the tank
with a slow forming grin he blows out a nearby candle taking us into
paytons eyes scan across the dim flickering computer screen a radar scan across a chart of planets
with no earth shown on the screen
payton is silently in shock as
gallo watches him closely from across the console
how could they
how could they have let this happen
payton slides his hands off the keyboard his finger tips i nearly twitching an uncontrolled tremble
he tries to hide his hands sliding them under the console as
gallo watches him blankly before wandering away to let him sit alone with the horrific realization
payton shakes his head refusing to accept it
a low shudder approaches more powerful then felt before rattling the pipes as it passes with a flicker of lights as
evalon is smiling towards bower as he kneels in front of her gripping her hands
as he speaks her smile fades slowly pulling her hands away and
the powerful shudder is felt amplified in the tank
nadia shakes awake to see
leland is kneeling over her eyes wide with hunger deliciously sniffing her body
they both jump with fright and yell in unison
nadia jumps to her feet choking and gasping jabbing her weapon toward leland a small breathing tube clenched in his teeth
bower and tana
ka are woken by their exchange dazed
what are you doing
what the he was he was gonna fucking eat me
mouthful of tube whaw
i waddnt he gassed us
he was gonna all of us
leland is appalled spitting out the breathing tube
they see hes holding a fork and knife that he quickly tucks behind his back
dia jabs the weapon and he shrieks
the shudder shakes the tank with more force then ever before as they watch the ceiling
its followed by two quick surges higher pitch
nadia looks to bower
what is that
into the final cycle
what does that mean
it means we have less time then i thought
the last phase
it means were
bower is oddly defeated taking a seat hanging his head
what do you mean done
what do we do
what difference does it make
what are you talking about
you said you could reset the reactor that we could that theres a chance to for what
everything is gone
theres no earth to go back to we werent meant to go back
we were meant to go on
and now its more important then ever
were the last of and what is left of us
whats left worth saving
this flights over
nadia is angered by his defeat shoving leland aside and squaring off in front of bower
what about your duty
theres still a chance shes shes dead
you dont know that for sure
nadia grabs him with rage glaring him in the eye
off her look bower holds his stare slowly seduced by her will
they look is broken by
lelands stereo system crackles with static power slowly returning after the power surge music playing
bower snaps out of his daze turning to leland
you got a radio
who the hell are you gonna call
you promise to bring it back
the radio speakers on the control console suddenly crackle with static and payton leaps forward in his chair snapping out of his daze
gallo looks up with a frown
do you copy
can you hear me
he grabs the receiver
where are you
our group is now crowded on the catwalk above the tank huddled around an assortment of patched together electronic equipment
bower is speaking into a receiver bound together with wire while leland cranks the power lever
storage tanks just below b level
mid ship sector twelve
payton vigorously cranks the power lever and slides his finger across the screen of the ships blueprint
how the hell did you get all the way to y the other side of payton listen to me
the i reactor is in its final stage
its last rotation
its worse then we thought
payton looks to gallo who is silently watching with a hollow glare from the corner
the ship is dying and i think thats why it finally woke us up
the entire system is heading into permanent shutdown and there will be no return
this entire ship will float off into eternity with no way of stopping it
we need to reset it
are you hearing me
payton and gallo share a silent stare
i hear you
how do we get you in there
i need you to give me a path
payton and gallos silent stare hangs in the air for a moment the tension between them unclear
payton turns to the console quickly typing into the keyboard
a flashlight beams cut into a shaft
it appears as if the gang is crawling backwards toward us until our perspective realizes theyre crawling down a long ladder
they reach the bottom level where a distant rumble has grown louder
they follow the sound through a field of debris to a clear path leading to an open hatchway
bower checks the marker over the door and leads them down the corridor preparing to step through and tanaka grabs him pulling him back
tanaka motions toward the hatchway shaking his head
he i gestures for them to follow and leads them over debris and through a hole hidden in the paneling
japanese no subtitles what did he say
but do what he says
they follow tanaka crawling through the hole and into
as they head across a loading dock the room gradually grows more disturbed and dishevelled
battle scars and centuries of wear and tear grow more and more evident as they cross
the blue glow of light can be seen through the passageway and a low rumble grows louder as they approach
they crouch behind a large industrial condensers to catch their breath
i bower glances up to the surface of the condenser with a frown and he touches it with his fingers to find an odd colored algae
he looks up to see its grown all the way to
be freezes to see a small shadowed figure in the rafters above them a smaller gargoyle type silhouette possibly some type of guard outside the entrance to the reactor bay
they exchange silent gestures and tanaka heads one direction as bower heads the other
to corner it
the figure begins to move across the rafter as tanaka flushes it out
the figure is forced to climb down hopping to the floor bower waits with his gun raised
out of the shadows steps
a ten year old child hunter
bower flinches with shock
the child is a younger version of the hunters awkward physique pale skin coated with hydraulic fluid oblong shaped head eyes hidden in shadow
nadir lowers her weapon
the child suddenly crouches in a fighting stance with a i gargled hiss from its throat the light catching its eyes to reveal white retinas deeply hidden under a thin
membrane of i skin
everyone is too stunned to react except for tanaka who instantly raises his weapon preparing to kill it
are you crazy
its just a child
thats no child
what the hell is it
tanaka lunges but nadia blocks his attack
the child hunter erupts with a horrific screech hissing at them before turning and leaping back up and over the rafters disappearing into the shadows
they are speechless
not as cute when theyre little are they
tanaka runs after it
it takes a moment for the rest to react chasing after
they run down the corridor and into the neighboring compartment stacked with broken and discarded equipment
the child runs up a wall of tubing and ducks through a small hole punctured in the vents
tanaka sighs with defeat
what do you mean they
how could they thats impossible
it appears the child has alerted his group as the bluish glow of flame can be seen growing stronger in the corridor the sounds of cackles and hisses approaching
little bastard rang the bell
they all quickly turn back running down a side corridor and into
they crouch and hide inside a smaller compartment as
the bluish glow passes outside the doorway
the child appears to be leading the group silhouettes passing more hunters then theyve ever seen together before
they silently share the horror of the possible numbers theyre up against
this isnt going to work
too many of them
have to turn back
theres no where to turn back to
we cant give up told you this wouldnt fly
you didnt tell us anything
you never said that
you said youd love to come oh
then i forgot
this wont work
this is where they live
reactor is the keepers temple
they watch and wait as the shadows move past the doorway with the glow of bluish torches and vocal cackles
payton is pulling wires out from under the console and going to the sealed doors where hes pulled apart the control panel preparing for a hot wire
gallo watches him while slowly pacing the room
what are you doing
i think the direct channels are fried
im gonna run a patch so we can get this door open as soon as were back on line
whats so important on the other side of the door
as soon as were up well be able to take control of guidance
but only from on the bridge
gallo continues pacing throwing glances toward the empty sleep chambers
this ship is not dying
payton refuses to look to gallo continuing his work
its already dead
you really believe that kid will be able to save this ship
he can do it
twelve hours ago he didnt know his own name
now you think hes ready to re configure a nuclear reactor
payton refuses to give him eye contact continuing to work on the computer as g allo paces back and forth in front of the sleep chambers fingers rapidly twitching at
hes the only shot we have
gotta have a little faith
after what you know now you can actually say that with a straight face
a little faith
a droplet of blood hits the floor at gallos feet
the glow of the hunters slowly begins to fade from sight as bower notices what hes hiding behind is an empty sleep chamber coated with dried blood and signs of
he looks to the labelled name plates with a frown and wanders deeper into the room
nadia follows him with a frown as leland and tanaka remain poised with weapons near the doorway
bowers walk slows as he moves past rows of sleep chambers nearly all of them have been opened and signs of violent deaths left dried and splattered across the floor
what are you doing
what is it
family members of flight personnel
she notices bower is holding evalons photo and glances to the row of empty chambers slowly realizing his grief
you think shes
shes not here
how do you know for sure
she could be shes not on this flight
she wouldnt come with me
she wouldnt marry me
sigh of disgust thats why i came
there was nothing left for me there
she stayed on earth
with everyone else
and i left because of her
his gaze begins to gloss over taking it all in
she saved your life
bower frowns on the thought slowly nodding in agreement
his eyes look to the label of the chamber he was led to the label reads m
he mumbles to himself memory returning
i remember her
i remember her
i remember his eyes pull focus coming out of his daze memories returning with confusion
are you alright
bower grips his weapon with a flexing jaw of determination heading back to where tanaka and leland are waiting as we
pp ytons name plate and the dried remains of her apparent death lay in the foreground
droplets of blood hit the floor at gallos feet as he paces back and forth near the sleep chambers
hes right about one thing
once that thing shuts down were as good as dead
nothing on this ship will ever turn on again
not the air not the lights the heat
not even the pods escape launch systems
payton refuses to look up from the computer
what are you saying
once its done
but we still have a way out of this
before its too late
what are you suggesting corporal
we can still launch ourselves in the pods
before the ignition systems are completely dead sir
into deep space when we dont even know where we are
we wouldnt last more then a few days inside those things
thats suicide a few days is better then what we have left here
ill take my chances
how long do you think that reactor has been sitting
that thing could melt down when he tries to fire the core
this ship could be ripped in half
stand down corporal
were not going to abandon anything and were not going to leave them behind we cant stay on this ship
you know that as well as i do i said stand down corporal
thats an order
gallo steps up behind payton his face revealed with a thin stream of blood oozing from under his nose dripping off his chin eyes hollow and pale
payton refuses to look at him continuing to type
the hunting party has faded from sight in the opposite direction leaving the hatch open to the reactor bay
this is our chance
bower leads the way out of the hiding place heading quickly towards the open hatch where an eerie glow and rumble is felt
they crawl through the hatch and enter into
they crawl out onto the top of a massive cylinder shaped shaft numerous catwalks lining the walls with nothing but an abyss of darkness below them
an odor hits all of them in unison
this is it
weve got to get down there before they come back
bower looks for a path downward along the tangled metal of catwalks coated in algae
lelands fear has instantly surfaced unable to move
i house of the keepers
a descent to hell itself
go in here
bower ignores his pleas heading down a ladder into the darkness tanaka and nadia follow pushing past him
you cant shut up
leland stays behind watching as they begin a perilous descent down the walls of the reactor bay wall
clinging onto the pipes and railings of the catwalks the odd colored algae grows more and more dense
a dim glow slowly coming into view from below
with a gap in the catwalk bower leaps across nearly losing his grip
he looks down to see an odd pattern of white shapes near the bottom
squinting into the darkness hes unable to make out what hes looking at and he manages to crawl down further reaching a gangplank that crosses to the towering reactor
he motions for nadia and tanaka to stay put and begins crawling across
towards a darkened control panel
leland is nervously watching from above leaning further over the railing and
a pen lamp slips free from his belt
the pen lamp clanks off one of the catwalks and tumbles past bower
dropping to the bottom
hitting the floor and illuminating the strange white objects covering the floor as
dozens of hunters all sleeping
their pale white bodies are intertwined and over lapped resembling an orgy of the living dead
the fall of the pen lamp causes one hunter to instantly spring to its feet lifting its nose towards the air like a guard dog checking the scent
bower remains frozen gripping the gangplank that hangs twenty feet above the field of sleeping hunters
i slowly the hunter returns to sleep slithering its way back into the folds of flesh and bower continues his crawl across
reaching the control panel
upon seeing the sleeping hunters leland fearfully backs away exiting the room
nadia and tanaka grip the ladders watching bower holding their breath in fright
bower grabs a vine but it breaks away and he dangles over the side losing his grip
nadia jumps across the gap and climbs down extending her weapon for him to grab
together they cling to the side of the reactor and bower taps the control panel switches and
his eyes widen with horror quickly searching for a solution
he slowly pumps a primer switch and
the light panel flickers gently under centuries of dust and vegetation
a light gently blinks on the control console and payton spots it with a frown running back from the door
thats the reactors activator panel
were going to make it out of this
gallos shadow moves behind him his voice taking on a slight raspier and older tone
how can i trust someone who isnt even honest with himself
payton refuses to acknowledge him continuing to monitor the control panel
he discreetly slides his hand closer to the pipe weapon as he senses gallos presence behind him
you have to listen to me
you dont haveato gallo steps closer behind him his shadowed outline showing an imposing posture his voice is forced and unsteady
dont do that
blood drops hit the floor heavily
payton slides his hand further across the console reaching for the pipe weapon eyes on the screen
dont talk to me like some child that needs reassurance
think i dont know the risks
think i dont know this ship
take it easy gallos presence is felt behind him his voice seeming to grow raspier and uneven with breath anger simmering
i know this ship and what shes capable of better then anyone
i know her
and i know what she can and cant do
she cant do
why are we even arguing
you know it im giving you an order
you wanna stay here to die thats your choice not mine
to stand down
payton shoves himself out of his chair reaching for the pipe weapon to find nothing
he spins to see gallo holding the pipe and the pistol gripped syringe glaring down at him
the heavy streams of blood are oozing from his nose and ears insanity shown in his hollow gaze
whos being irrational here lieutenant
whos being delusional
payton raises his hands calmly submitting
think about what youre doing
im getting off this ship
my flights over
another panel on the console begins to gently blink as
bower and nadia cling to the side of the reactor quietly flipping switches and entering codes as
the sea of hunters sleep below them
bower unfolds the auxiliary power lever each movement creating a creak of rusted metal
he grips the handle and slowly begins to turn the magneto crank
the creaks of rusted metal and the low whine of magnetos grows louder
hunters begin to stir in their sleep as nadia watches them with fright
gallo is jabbing the pistol gripped syringe towards payton motioning him closer to the sleep pods
he motions and payton kneels at the panel
entering the code
this wont work
gallo jabs the syringe gun towards the back of paytons head while putting one foot inside the pod
just think about what youre doing payton continues entering the launch code as gallo steps inside with his other foot
it wasnt the crew that was sick was it
finish the code
what did you really do to them
gallo slides into the pod and
payton hits a key and lights blink
gallo looks away for a second and payton suddenly grabs the hatch lever
slamming it closed
he cranks the latch locking gallo inside
payton wedges a pipe through the handle as gallo violently kicks the hatch
for your own good youre not well corporal
you just need the proper treatment this isnt your fault your mind
has turned against itself
gallo explodes with rage
pounding on the hatch with a jack hammer of fists bones shattering in his own hands
payton ignores his screams going back to the console and typing i into the keyboard
bower cranks the hand lever faster and faster the moan of magnetos growing louder and louder
he gives one last spin and hits the primer switch
a split second of nothing and then the panels brightly come to life
the digital panel reads rotation sequence code initiate to proceed bower takes a sigh of relief and glances to see nadia is frozen with fright
he follows their eye line to see the entire floor of hunters are awake heads turned towards them
heflin steps closer in their direction with a hiss
bower gasps and the entire pack of hunters moves toward them and
suddenly tanaka bangs his bladed weapon against the railing with a heavy clank
the hunters instantly turn toward his direction and tanaka throws his weapon hitting one of the hunters directly in the head
tanaka jumps to the neighboring catwalk and breaks through a hatch coated with vines and vegetation
heflin screeches a command and the hunters ignite in a chain reaction grabbing their weapons and taking chase like a swarm of attack dogs
they climb the wall with inhuman speed and rush out the hatch following tanaka
bower turns back to the panel flipping more switches and continuing the process as the reactor begins to hum as
tanaka is running at full sprint bounding over dishevelled equipment and weaving through debris as the pack of enraged hunters emerge from every direction to follow his path
one hunter gains quickly at a sprinters pace and tanaka runs directly for the open hatchway
the hatchway they detoured earlier
he dives through as the sprinting hunter is almost upon him
a booby trap is sprung hydraulic pistons snap a razor wire that clotheslines the hunter nearly ripping him in half as tanaka hits the floor rolls to his feet and
heflin and the hunters slash the tangled snare with their weapons trying to break through
bower types quickly flipping numerous switches and
a shudder is felt the tower begins to tremble with a low bass moan like an engine trying to turn over
nadia looks back to see there are still hunters in the reactor bay ones who didnt join the chase slowly coming out of the shadows crawling up the walls
im going as fast as i can he hits the final key as nadia grabs his shoulder
he turns to see
weasel and numerous hunters have them surrounded waiting to pounce
with nowhere to go they are done for as weasel cackles a command the hunters moving in just as
high pressure steam erupts from the reactors pressure relief valves
the hunters back pedal in fear as the ventilation system ignites
fresh oxygen hits the blue torches
bursting into brilliant orange fireballs
the hunters scatter in a panic as the bright flames are blinding and a tremendous shudder travels through the ship like an earthquake
the shudder hits the control desk rattling the monitors and warning lights and buzzers ignite as the ship feels full power after centuries of laying dormant
i gallo slows his pounding blood coating his fists
i my god
he did it
he did it
the screens flicker brightly all of the systems engaging
gallo is shocked pressing his face against the glass peering across the computer terminals that are igniting
let me out
payton ignores him typing rapidly into the keyboard
ill help you
please i can help
payton runs over to the security door and hits a switch on the sensor
the door doesnt react
what are you doing
you cant youre trying to get on the bridge
payton runs back to the console typing into the terminal
you dont want to go in there corporal
payton throws him a glare continuing to type in commands as the room erupts with activity
what are you going to tell them
how are you going to explain that
theyll know what you did
other hunters have retreated away from the reactor cowering in fear with the exception of weasel enraged by the temples disturbance
he hisses as he lunges for bower
trying to duck they slam into the reactor wall and crash to the catwalk below
weasel has incredibly quick reflexes as he springs back to his feet just as bower charges into him slamming into a wall of burning algae
the fire quickly spreads across weasels skin igniting the oil thats been rubbed across his body
with weasel screeching wildly and engulfed in flame bower viciously continues pummeling him throwing a rage of blows until the body stops twitching
the flames begin to catch on bowers arms and nadia pulls him back
they look to see most of the hunters fleeing the room but others have grabbed weapons
bower grabs her arm pulling her towards the hatch
as bower and nadia run the ship comes to life all around them every light flashing and every mechanism engaging at full power
a startling contrast of blinding white walls and glowing floors as they run down the corridor
steam erupts from pipes and lights blindly flicker as hunters scatter and run off in separate directions
slowly tanaka emerges from a hiding place dropping down from the rafters overhead
with a grin he turns to head back the other direction to see
heflin waiting for him
they stare one another down both raising their bladed weapons as lights shatter and implode around them from their own intensity
heflin lunges with a hiss and blades clash
payton rapidly pounds his fingers into the keyboard and
causing one of the security doors to engage
but its the wrong door revealing a corridor leading endlessly into the back of the ship
where do you think youre going
payton continues to work the control panels looking to the sealed door on the other end of the room
think about what youre doing sir gallo pushes his knees against the hatch the pipe beginning to bend the seal cracking open
you dont want to see whats in there the control panel on a sleep chamber is flashing as a passenger kicks his hatch open from the inside
the haggard and bewildered passenger crawls out to find himself in the middle of chaos
before he can get a breath hes attacked by what was once a dark and haunting chamber of metal is now a disco tech from hell as lights flash across
the corridor in what appears to be a massive riot passengers and hunters fighting
bower and nadia run across the top of the sleep chamber wall thirty feet above the havoc thats ensuing below
a light bulbs burst as
metal blades spark as they connect between heflin and tanaka
the sword play is crude but powerful and brutal
heflin cant match his skills and pile drives him ripping into him with his own bare hands and a horrific screech
tanaka tries to grab a hold of him but heflin digs in with his teeth biting into his stomach
tanaka screams hitting heflins head with everything hes got but he wont let go
tanaka lifts heflins feet and roars as he charges himself directly into the wall neck bones snapping
heflin goes limp dropping to the floor dead as tanaka gasps
looking down to see the damage has been done blood flowing heavily
he takes a breath turns to exit freezing to see
the child hunter standing alone sensing the death of heflin with almost an expression of sorrow
tanaka lowers his weapon and
the child stabs tanaka in the chest with a small bladed weapon
tanaka gasps with shock collapsing to his knees eyes wide before going to the floor
the child begins to feed
bower and nadia climb to a cat walk only to see hunters are following their trail
they run to a ladder and spot leland already climbing above them
half way up leland looks back to see them coming with hunters close behind
he gives them a look before closing the hatch and latching it
you snake bastard open it
with the yells muffled under the hatch leland runs towards an open door at the far end of the long corridor
inside the door at the far end
payton is at the control console quickly typing into the keyboard
he hears the e hatch crack open and he spins to see gallo out of the pod with a twisted grin holding the pistol gripped syringe
we both know who needs this shot
payton counters with the bladed weapon
whos the one suffering
sir payton lunges with the weapon rage in his eyes as
gallo jabs with the pistol syringe they lock hands grabbing one anothers wrists
slamming into the wall
upon impact with the wall gallo suddenly appears slightly older his voice lowering in level
payton slams him against the wall making him older
payton slams him again a flash that reveals gallo has aged almost matching payton their voices sounding the same
has turned against itself ill fucking carve you up
within the struggle hands grab at weapons a wrist is twisted
lining up both of their identification tattoos to be identical
the syringe is stabbed into skin
the trigger fires liquid injecting the chemical into someones arm as their voices converge over lapping at first and becoming one voice
its for the best
leland runs up the corridor through the doors and into the room gasping for breath pausing to see
payton is alone
hes just injected the syringe into his own wrist
hes the only person in the room
heavy blood streams are running from his nose and ears
y e will now refer to payton by his real name gallo
leland and gallo exchange a look
gallo seeming to snap out of his trance
leland approaches wheezing for air
we made it
we im with your boy
i was the one helping with gallo suddenly slashes his throat
leland reels back in shock throttling his own neck in horror blood gushing
gallo casually turns back to the console continuing to type as leland tries to cry out his voice gargled with blood as he staggers collapsing to the floor
gallo hits a key and lights ignite the last door finally engaging
gallo sigh with relief as the doors slide open revealing a corridor of stairs leading to the bridge
a warm and gentle smile widens on his face
captain on the bridge
he heads toward the bridge while flipping another switch that ignites the opposite doors just as
bower and nadia angrily burst through the hatch in the floor jamming it behind them and run up the corridor
they see the doors sliding shut
go for it
with hunters hot on their trail
they run full sprint towards the sliding doors
hunters lunge out of side corridors with screeching hisses as bower and nadia dive through the sliding doors
one hunter is crushed by the doors
split nearly in half with a heavy thud of steel and a moan of hydraulics
the hunter spasms wildly kicking and clawing as bower and nadia back pedal into the room
hunters gather at the gap stabbing weapons between the doors trying to crawl through with screeches and hisses of rage
bower and nadia back further away turning to see the room
the original room that bower woke up in now looks quite different with all the systems engaged blinding light coming from the monitors and computer terminals
they move through the room passing the empty sleep chambers and the control console seeing the entire pathway of dripped blood across the floor
hes not my lieutenant
she frowns off his look and turns to see
leland on the floor in a pool of blood throat slashed dead
bower pulls the gun and heads into the open doorway leading towards the bridge as nadia follows behind
a tunneled stairwell widens out into the main flight bridge
a stunning sight a split level glass control deck rows of blinking control panels and flight chairs
it appears undisturbed a thin layer of silt floats out from under their footsteps
bower leads the way panning the weapon throughout the room with no sign of gallo
on the far wall cockpit windows coated with a black fungus that obscures the view but hints to the illusion of outer space a haze of cosmic dust without stars
where are we
bower goes to the nearest control console tapping the keyboard
the computer instantly responds data scrolling across the screen
itll tell us how long weve i been out
and how far weve gone
bower types in a command and the computer begins to scroll through the flight computers time code
starting with the launch date and time the numbers begin to roll faster and faster
nadia walks towards the windows and suddenly jumps back with fright to realize one of the flight control chairs has a figure sitting in it
gallo motionless and gazing toward the windows
off her gasp bower grabs his gun and approaches as the computer time code continues to roll even faster with no sign of slowing
months becoming years
bower approaches from behind gallo
his identification tatto now clearly visible
he cranks the lever on the gun with a whine of magnetos and the laser sights flare brightly onto gallos back
seems my little memory lapse has finally worn off
bower slowly approaches moving closer to his profile the stream of blood from gallos ear shown running down his neck
who the hell are you
gallo keeps his gaze towards the windows emotionless
youre team four
why would you
pretend to be someone else
what would you be wanting to hide
who the hell are you
i was younger then you when i first came on board
funny i cant even remember what it was like
before this flight began
its all i know
you were the one
who first received the final transmission
who refused to go back to sleep
you stayed awake
for all those years
what were you doing
what crimes were you hiding from when you took paytons bunk
the time code display rolls faster years rolling into decades
blip blip blip
how the hell would you know all that
is it true
what have you done to us
where are we now
gallo lazily nods towards the windows
take a peek
you tell me
bower hesitates looking toward the darkened windows
he stays with the weapon on gallo as nadia wanders toward the front control console towards the glass
with the lights fading on the weapon bower gives the lever a quick whirl motioning the barrel closer
you gonna do bower
theres no one left to hand out merit badges
no one left at all
and that makes it okay
to play god
you think god survived
with the rest
theres no one left to judge you bower
nadia approaches the glass squinting towards the heavily smudged glass
she frowns trying to wipe away the layer of sludge
judgement will come for you
you think you could cover it
your victims survived
thats your creation out there
bower jabs the gun into his back with force
and you thought youd be able to hide it
who would ever suspect that
who would ever remember
nadia rubs the glass with her hand squinting into the darkness
the time code display rolls faster decades into centuries
blip blip blip
no world left
you the law now
you gonna be the one that brings order to whats left
wanna take a shot at it
i did my best with what i was given
wanna be king for a day
give it a whirl corporal
id like to see how you fare
with the laser sights fading on the weapon bower quickly cranks the power lever keeping the gun raised a slow grin spreads across gallos face as he finally looks to
him revealing the thick streams of blood that have dripped from his nose coating his chin and neck
try to imagine it
yourself for five minutes without morality
ill bet youd surprise even yourself kid shut up
whats out there
nadia shakes her head rubbing away the sludge from the glass squinting harder
whats left to stop you
i offer you the kingdom and you theres still quite a few sleeping beauties down there
a thousand flavors
you up for a little window shopping
licking his lips i wanna see it
ill bet youd be a bower suddenly shoves him out of the chair slamming him to the floor jabbing the barrel into the back of his neck
there will be law
in whatever world we create
and youll pay for what youve done
gallo chuckles with his face pressed to the floor
a real boy scout is that it kiddo
nadia suddenly gasps
flinching away from the cockpit windows having just seen whats outside
her expression is ghostly as she back pedals
what is it
gallo looks up with a blood soaked grin
what do you see
you ready for the new world corporal
bower keeps the gun on him as he goes to the windows
nadia has a ghostly expression unable to speak
bower leans toward the glass squinting into the darkness and
an object moves past the outside of the glass
he leans closer squinting to see
a school of alien fish dart past
the shin is underwater
bower staggers in shock back pedalling as gallo continues to chuckle
weve already crashed
the time code display rolls centuries past more then a thousand years accounted for as it finally slows to a stop
all this time
bower staggers against the console in shock
the weapon lowering to his side
i guess this thing does land itself
just doesnt float too well
bower lunges towards him and gallo is ready for this one quickly countering his move and slamming bower into the console
he unleashes a vicious blow into bowers throat
bower collapses choking for air and gallo kicks the gun away
he kneels over bower slowly pulling out a blade
and you thought you could be king
he slides the blade under bowers neck and
theres a whirl of magnetos
he looks up to see nadia cranking the lever on the energy gun
she tries to turn the gun towards him and
gallo lunges toward her just as shes able to fire
st of energy goes into the console with a crack of thunder knocking everyone off their feet
shattered glass and metal hit the cockpit window like a spray of shrapnel
sending a thin crack across the surface of the glass
she struggles to crank the lever again as gallo charges hitting the gun away
he slams her over the console
the crack on the window begins to spiderweb across
gallo grabs her hair to expose her neck and angles the blade upward forcing her to take a gasp as
water explodes through the windows hitting the room like a hundred fire hoses
gallo is hit directly and thrown across the room as nadia and bower are engulfed by the blast of black water sent tumbling
the tremendous roar of rushing water rolls them down the stairwell and into the sleep chamber compartment in a raging torrent a tidal wave slams into the wall
bower grabs onto nadia and they claw themselves along the wall as computer terminals spark and lights go black
he pulls her to a sleep chamber and he jumps inside the open hatch pulling her with
are you crazy he pulls her inside and turns to the control panel
he hits the keypad to read detachment initiated bower struggles to close the hatch as water rushes in slamming it shut on top of them
gallo struggles to keep his head above water as the fast moving current slams him into the edge of the doorway
his i fingers claw at the manual lever for the door tugging and tugging with no effect as the water rises above his head
bower and nadia are squeezed together inside the pod as water quickly rises above the porthole
not like this
i cant like this
under the roar of the rushing water hydraulics ignite
micro jets fire and whoosh
the pod launches shooting down a tunnel until theyre hit with a tremendous jolt
they are sent spinning into a wild tumble as bubbles and gas erupt across the outer surface
bower and nadia slam into one another as the chamber turns end over end
its roll seems to slow for a brief moment and bower squints toward the porthole to see
they are pulling away from the side of the ship
the exterior hull of the massive space ship slides past at a high rate of speed with a swirl of ocean water and bubbles
the pod slams into something as sparks fly and seals are ruptured as water sprays in with a blinding blast
the chamber is sent into another violent roll as nadia and bower tumble head over feet as if caught within a washing machine
the chamber finally steadies as water washes across the control panel one last burst of sparks knocks out the lights taking them into black
only their gasps are heard as they squirm towards the upper corner
only a foot of air remaining
he grabs the mask connected to tubes in the side and pulls the straps over her head
i what are you doing
put it on
i cant not like this
im not going to wake up and drowned he pulls it over her face as the water rises with only several inches of air inside the chamber
bower gasps desperately into the corner
nadia gasps the air through the mask making her eye lids droop slowly going unconscious
bower gasps one last breath and the water rises over his head
bower watches her body go limp and squirms for air as
a warm glow of white light grows brighter through the porthole
as sunlight dances through the porthole he kicks at the hatch and
bower kicks open the hatch gasping for breath
a gentle breeze ripples across the water with a sunlight flickering across the surface of an ocean
he pulls nadia out of the chamber ripping the mask off her face
her eye lids slowly begin to flicker back to consciousness
she chokes on the air and struggles to orientate herself looking up to see him gazing down at her coated with bright sunlight
where are we
its all right
its safe to wake up this time
with eyes of disbelief they turn to see
they sit on the edge of the sleep chamber as it lightly bobs within the ocean waves
theyre just off shore from a stretch of mountainous tropical islands with waves crashing against the beaches
the unusual shape of the islands and their geography are nothing like weve ever seen on earth
several moons dot the sky and the sun is rising with a brilliant glow on the horizon
a low churning is heard a motor that is pumping as the water lowers allowing us to see across the dishevelled command platform the walls dripping with water
the water is being drained through the grates in the floor as unseen bilge pumps are heard loudly whirling
the pump motors whine down and shut off as
a hand flips off the switch for the ventilation ducts
standing at the console having changed clothes and recovered from the ordeal
he examines the empty tank where bowers sleep chamber once sat
he eyes the other sleep chambers deeply contemplating
he goes back to the control console scanning across the numerous surveillance monitors that reveal
passengers and hunters engaged in a variety of activities all across the ship
some are seen fighting some searching for food some searching for a way out some alone weeping
a kingdom for the taking
he pulls out a coffee packet and slowly begins mixing himself a cup deeply contemplating as he looks across the screens
he glances over to see
young gallo the younger version of himself who is seated nearby watching with a grin
the blood is gone from his face appearing clean cut clean uniform
well if youre gonna be captain
what are we gonna do now
off his look
doors open to another sleep chamber compartment completely undisturbed
four undisturbed sleep chambers are lined against the wall
gallo enters now wearing the captains uniform he straightens his collar and kneels next to one of the pods typing into the panel
a grin appears as he removes the wedding ring paytons ring hed forgotten hes still wearing
what is a king
without his queen
he hits the control panel switch and
a female crew member a beautiful young woman deep in hyper slumber suddenly twitches
her eyes opening wide with a gasp as she stares into camera
