written by steve feke and fred walton a quiet upper middle class neighborhood
the camera is at the curb looking down the street
there are no sidewalks
trees arch overhead
cicadas drone on the soundtrack
the opening titles briefly fade in and out framed by the trees on either side of the street
footsteps are heard approaching
as the picture title fades out of the dark emerges a girl years old carrying schoolbooks
this is jill
camera pans with her ninety degrees as she comes to the front of a house and stops
lights are on in the bottom half of the house and the curtains across the windows are open
a single light burns in the upper right side of the house presumable in a bedroom but the curtains in the room are drawn
a scene title appears on the lower half of the screen pm tuesday march the title fades and jill heads up the walk to the front door of the house
the light in the upper floor of the house is turned off
a middle aged doctor is standing at the foot of the stairs
his wife is descending the stairs putting on her earrings
she is in an obvious hurry
wheres the girl
i only called her ten minutes ago passing into living room i made our reservation for
were going to be late
the doorbell rings
here she is now
he crosses to the front door and opens it
the girl smiles at him uncomfortably from outside
everyone gets it wrong the first time
come on in
entering thank you
the wife comes back into the front hall
ive written the number of the restaurant on the notepad by the phone
to doctor zip me up will you please
to jill if we arent home in two hours it means weve decided to go on to a movie and wont be back until after midnight

helping wife on with her coat ive told my service to pick up any calls coming in to my office phone
the children are asleep upstairs first door on your left at the top of the landing
theyre both just getting over a cold so try not to wake them

jill shakes her head
we have to go now
they cross to the front door and begin to exit
make yourself at home
the refrigerators loaded
pulling doctor through the door goodbye
the doctor pokes his head back through the door
we even have some low fat yogurt
will you please come on
the doctor pulls the door shut behind him
jill turns toward the living room
she walks into the living room and sets her books down on a table with the telephone on it
we hear the car doors close the engine start up then the car backing out the driveway and heading down the street
it is dark
we hear the phone in the living room being lifted off its receiver a dial tone then a number is dialed
pause then ringing
camera slowly dollies from the dining room across the front hall and into the living room where we see jill talking over the phone to a girlfriend nancy

and thank you
jill makes a face at the phone and hangs up
she tries to go back to her homework but she cannot
jill is working now diligently
the phone rings
she picks it up
there is a brief pause then the line goes dead and a dial tone cuts in
jill hangs up and goes back to work
the phone rings again
jill picks it up
a voice speaks on the other end of the phone
have you checked the children
the line goes dead
jill hangs up and goes right back to work
jill sits at the table as before doing her homework smoking a cigarette
the phone rings
jill picks it up
have you checked the children
the line goes dead
jill hangs up and looks off into space thinking
we hear a faint rattling noise from somewhere in the house
jill hears it too
she stubs out her cigarette gets up from the table and walks out of the living room
jill enters the hallway and pauses
then she starts walking slowly down the hall to the kitchen door
again the rattling noise o
only louder this time
jill stops dead listens then continues forward even more cautiously
as jill enters
she cannot find the lightswitch so she stands in the darkness listening
again the rattle very close now
jill turns her head sharply then walks to the refrigerator and opens it
it is only the automatic icemaker creating the rattle
jill takes a piece of cake from the refrigerator and leaves the kitchen
jill is sitting at the table polishing off the cake
then the phone rings
jill stands up quickly and picks up the phone
have you checked the children
i dont think this is very funny
billy doesnt answer
who is this
the line goes dead
jill stands frozen beside the table with the phone in her hand as the dial tone gets louder and louder
jill is standing at the wet bar in the corner pouring herself a drink
she samples the alcohol doesnt cough and starts to pour a little more into the glass
the phone rings
jill turns then slowly walks to the table kneels down and quietly picks up the phone and brings it to her ear
she waits and listens a full three seconds
no sound comes to her
she quickly hangs up the phone before the silence can be broken by the voice she knows is waiting on the other end
then she shuffles through her books and papers on the table top until she finds the notepad the doctors wife has left for her with the name and phone number
of the restaurant
jill picks up the phone and dials
after several rings
hello id like to speak to dr
this is his babysitter
hold on a minute
jill waits for several seconds until the maitre d comes back on the line
mandrakis left the restaurant about forty minutes ago
after a beat okay
she hangs up thinks for a moment then picks up the phone again and dials o
can you get me the police
is this an emergency
beat no not really
the number is
would you like me to connect you
seventh precinct sergeant sacker
hello ive been getting phone calls every fifteen minutes or so
i think its a man
hes trying to scare me
an anonymous caller
has he threatened you
has he been using obscene language
he just keeps calling me
sometimes he doesnt say anything
theres really nothing we can do about it down here
is the phone listed in your name
no im just the babysitter
its probably just some weirdo
the citys full of them
believe it or not we get reports like this every night
its nothing to worry about
have you tried whistling
if you can find a good loud whistle somewhere in the house blow it into the phone hard next time he calls
probably break his eardrum
he wont bother you after that
youre probably right
its nothing to worry about
or you could just take your phone off the hook
no the people im babysitting for might try to reach me
well as i say theres nothing we can really do to help you down here
jill hangs up
after thinking for a moment she tries a couple of ways of whistling as loud as she can but frustrated and feeling foolish she soon gives up
jill is sitting in an armchair facing the tv set
the tv is on but she is bored
she runs through several channels then gets up and turns the tv off
she looks around and moves aimlessly back to the table but o
a dog is barking and she is drawn to the window
a car passes outside its lights reflecting off the window and jills face
then the phone rings
jill moves quickly from the window to the table and answers the phone
why havent you checked the children
stunned jill hangs up the phone
she turns and goes slowly back to the window
she pulls the shutters closed in front of the window
then she walks out of the living room
jill goes to the front door turns the bolt and draws the chain across the door
then she starts to go upstairs
the phone rings
she stops halfway up the stairs
she turns and comes back down the stairs to answer the phone but then thinks better of it
she sits on the bottom step and lets the phone ring and ring
finally it stops
jill gets up and heads into the living room
jill goes to the table picks up the phone and dials
seventh precinct sergeant sacker
i called you before
about the man who keeps calling me
he called me again
did you try whistling
no hes out there somewhere
in the neighborhood
hes been watching me
through the windows
did you see him
i know hes there
is the house locked up
and the windows
then youre safe
if he wanted to break in he wouldnt be calling you
please cant you help me
im all alone
tell you what
if this guy calls you again he will call again
i know he will
okay calm down now
i can alert the phone company so that if he calls again we can try to trace the call
whats your number there
and the address
oh yeah i know where that is
if the guy calls again try to keep him on the line for at least a minute so we can trace the call
but he never stays on that long
sometimes he hangs up after just a couple of seconds
its the only way we can help you
beat by the way whats your name
jill the important thing is to relax
youre safe where you are
weve got patrolmen cruising the area all night long
just stay calm
will you do that for me
in the meantime well be watching your line
call again if theres any problem
jill hangs up the phone and looks forlornly off into space
jill is sitting on the sofa a drink in one hand a cigarette in the other
she is waiting
she sets her glass down stubs out the cigarette leans back and sighs
she is very tense
then the phone rings
she rises from the sofa and slowly crosses to the table
she sits down and picks up the phone
during this conversation it becomes apparent that the voice has a slight english accent
who are you
i wont be here much longer
the doctor and his wife are coming home soon
can you see me
turning toward the window im sorry i turned the lights down
it didnt work anyway
i can turn them back up if you like dont
beat youve really scared me
is that what you wanted
beat is that what you wanted
what do you want
all over me
jill is terrified
you dont know me
you dont know who i am or where i live
ill get dr
mandrakis to drive me home
him or the police
youve called the police
jill searches for some way of answering him
i want to talk to you
the line goes dead
jill hangs up
she starts to shake
the phone rings and jill snatches it up
leave me alone
jill this is sergeant sacker
listen to me
beat weve traced the call
its coming from within the house
a squad cars on its way over there now
just get out of that house
jill hangs up
she stands frozen in shock
several seconds go by
she doesnt move
then the phone rings
she turns and tiptoes toward the front door
halfway there the phone stops ringing
she pauses for a second then continues
jill reaches the front door
carefully quietly she turns the bolt
she hears a creak
she turns and looks up the staircase
at the top a door is opening
someone is coming out
a mumbling sound is heard on the sound track
jill whirls around back to the door and yanks at it
it opens but only an inch
the chain is still across it
she frantically works to get the chain free
after agonizing seconds the chain falls clear and the door swings open
standing there on the other side of the door is a police detective john clifford
we have cut ahead in time some twenty or thirty minutes
behind him on the street several patrol cars and an ambulance are pulled up at the curb their domelights silently flashing
are the parents here yet
yeah they arrived about ten minutes ago
beat what a homecoming
they wanted to talk to someone
i asked them to wait until you got here
come on in
clifford sighs and steps into the front hall
the door is closed by the uniformed cop with whom clifford has been speaking
the cop is a man in his thirties
his name is charles garber
garber and clifford stand in the front hall and talk as policemen and ambulance attendants move around them
in the living room beyond can be seen several other policemen dr
mandrakis and his wife
we were only a block away when the call went out
when we got here the guy was still waiting upstairs in the childrens bedroom
he was covered with blood
not his own
the children had been dead for several hours
hed been using an old phone in their bedroom that the parents had never had disconnected
who is he
we found a merchant seamans card on him
entered the country less than a week ago
how about the babysitter
shes going to be all right
as garber delivers his final line we see ambulance attendants dressed in white taking a sheet covered stretcher out the front door
an upper class neighborhood
the camera is facing down the street
a car approaches the intersection at the end of the block turns and comes slowly up the street
because it is not a new car or an expensive car and because it is moving at a rate which suggests that its sole male occupant is looking for house
numbers we can assume that the driver is a visitor to this neighborhood
the camera pans with the car ninety degrees as it turns into the semi circular driveway of a mansion and rolls up to the front door
a title appears across the bottom of the screen pm thursday april as the title fades the driver shuts off the car engine and opens the door to get out
the doorbell rings
a houseboy comes into the front hall goes to the door and opens it for the visitor
it is john clifford the detective from six years ago
he has aged noticeably over the years
his hair is grayer his stance not so aggressive but his eyes still smoulder with the accumulated frustration of having spent years in an uncertain sometimes unsatisfying and frequently unsafe
no words are exchanged as the houseboy leads clifford across the entrance hall and up an imposing flight of stairs
still keen in his observation of things clifford quickly takes in this new atmosphere
the house is richly decorated but with an underlying theme of melancholy
there are no bright or cheerful furnishings and the houseboy advances with guarded tread his face steady and reverent
the houseboy stops before a door at the top of the staircase and raps lightly on it with his knuckles
without waiting for an answer he opens the door and steps aside for clifford to enter
clifford pauses briefly then walks into what appears to be an upstairs study
a man is sitting behind a desk which faces the door
presumably he is the master of the house
although his face is hidden in shadows we can see from his hands that he is engaged in writing something down
clifford quietly approaches the desk and takes a seat in front of it
then vaguely in keeping with the spirit of the house he waits to be spoken to rather than interrupt the pervasive stillness
after a moment the master of the house lays down his pen and leans back in his chair
so youre in business for yourself now
quietly yes sir for the past three and a half years
beat and youd heard about curt duncans escape
do you think the police will
i know they havent assigned anyone to it specifically
its an old case
a tinge of bitterness an old case
beat can you find him
maybe not tomorrow maybe not this week but ill find him
he could be anywhere by now
i dont think so
because hes a foreigner
hell come back to the city
after six years in confinement its the only place thats familiar to him
a man murders two children in cold blood
a jury declares him insane
how could such a person not be
clifford lowers his eyes doesnt answer
he is sent to a state mental institution where the security is
less than perfect
and he escapes
it isnt fair
the master of the house leans way forward over his desk and his face comes out of the shadows and into the light
it is dr
he seems much older
his complexion is pallid
his eyes stare out from beneath his brow like a wounded animal hiding in a dark cave
a thing like that should never be allowed to happen again
i couldnt agree with you more
they look at each other for a long moment of acknowledgment
then mandrakis stands up with a sigh
go ahead then
my accountant will contact you
clifford stands and they shake hands
beat how is mrs
unable to have any more children
please give her my best
clifford turns to go
as clifford finds his own way down the stairs and out the front door
a woman watches clifford leave from the back of the staircase
it is mrs
as with her husband the change in her is remarkable
she is now a brooding barren woman
the front door closes
clifford is gone
mandrakis walks around the front of the stairs and begins slowly ascending them
the houseboy silently steps into the entrance hall from a side door and watches her
a male patient wearing green institutional pajamas and slippers shuffles slowly up the hall
his movement is catatonic unfocused
canned musak faintly underscores the scene
curt duncan isnt going to run right out and kill more children
im not worried about that
standing in the doorway of an office facing into the hall watching the patient
we had him for six years
under continuous therapy some of it rather forceful
moving past camera
he is really out of it
it is a depressing vaguely unnerving sight
tranquilizers depressants lithium
he turns and goes back into the office
we see now the man whos been talking the director of the state hospital dr
he is sitting comfortably behind his desk his jacket off his tie loosened his feet up on the desk
he is very matter of fact
eventually anyone will respond to the treatment here
clifford sits down in front of the desk picks up a folder and leafs through it
you gave him electric shock
yeah we zapped him a few times
its fairly standard
it says here thirty eight
thirty eight times
monk shrugs then yawns expansively
he neednt justify himself to the layman
what will happen to him now without the drugs he was on
monks secretary enters the office and hands him a folder
without interrupting the delivery of his lines monk takes the folder opens it initials something on the inside closes the folder and hands it back to the secretary who turns
and leaves the office without uttering a word
therell be some deterioration
thats inevitable but we cant say how much
clifford looks at the doctor as if questioning his casual assessment of some deterioration
during the time that you had him here did you discover any particular habits of his peculiarities quirks anything that might help me find him
shrugging again its all in the folder
any letters from people back in england
that too is in the folder
clifford directs a bleak look back down at the open folder then looks up again his eyes narrowing
lets get something straight here doctor
ive been years in the business of tracking people down and putting them away
i spent almost a year on curt duncan alone with the trial the testimonies the background investigations
i didnt come here today to look in your goddamn folders
in fact i wouldnt have come here at all if youd done your job right
clifford this is a hospital not a penitentiary
everything that pertains to one of our patients is meticulously recorded in that patients folder
whether you can make sense of it or not
they glare at each other for several seconds
monk is the first one to look away
curt duncan is a classic paranoid schizophrenic
they see themselves as victims and they always blame other people for the way they are
when duncan killed the mandrakis kids it wasnt an act of hostility against the children but against their parents
he was getting back at his own parents for traumas he suffered in early childhood
the criminal side of curt duncan is one of terrible symbolic vengeance
looking up assuming he isnt found right away
what will happen to him
monk rises and walks to a window
i think youll find him
somebody will find him
he cant function out there
hell make a mistake
turning to face clifford this is where he belongs
after six years in here hes suddenly gone out to confront the world again
i think hes in for a bit of a shock
monk looks back out the window
not a terribly good section of town
we are looking at the nondescript exterior of a bar across the street
this is not a slum bar but its close
there are a few tables and chairs and a pool table in the back
the atmosphere is quiet almost depressed and the handful of regulars here are exercising their privacy without having to be alone
they include hank the bartender also the owner who absently polishes things with his cloth tracy an unemployed woman in her mid forties who sits at the bar with a
drink and a cigarette and silently rummages through her current feelings none of them new or particularly hopeful a couple probably retired sitting at the same table they come to every afternoon at this time him for his beer her for a glass of sweet white wine and bill at the pool table a young man lithe and powerful minding his own business and playing his game of pool with a steady aggressive concentration
rackin em up today bill
over his shoulder doin all right
the old man smiles stupidly around the room
he racked em up a little in his day too
his smile fades as he looks at his wife
he takes a sip of beer and lapses into memories
then the door opens to the outside and the yellow orange light of late afternoon floods into the bar
the regulars turn to glimpse whos coming in
they see the figure of a man silhouetted in the doorway
he stands there for a long moment not coming in
finally even bill interrupts his game to turn and look
cmon in and shut the door
the intruder enters indecisively
the door swings shut behind him plunging the room back into darkness
this man is a little weird and the regulars continue to stare at him until he makes his way to a table near the wall and sits down
then everyone returns to his own thoughts
after a moment whatll it be
pause no answer hey
whatll it be
a bit startled a bit defensive toward the directness of this question
it is curt duncan
he looks understandably harried
he hasnt slept or shaved in at least a couple of days and is wearing regular clothing
he clears his throat to answer
what kind of clothes was he wearing
when he escaped
clifford is looking through the folder again
ordinary street clothes
not all of our patients have to wear the green gucci gowns
did he have any money with him
but not more than say fifty dollars
some of the patients are given little jobs around the ward for which they are paid
its part of the rehabilitation
looking down clifford pauses over a page in the folder
a page of legibly organized facts and statistics about curt duncan
one of the entries reads guy du marraux
reading whats guy du mar pronouncing it correctly guy du marraux syndrom
its a psycho motor dysfunction
duncan had it
only from time to time which is unusual
what is it
it attacks the nervous system
people suffering from it are irresistibly compelled to utter obscenities sometimes one sometimes a whole string of them
they cant control it
somewhat taken aback are you being serious
here ill give you an example
he opens a file cabinet drawer finds a reel of quarter inch magnetic tape and starts to thread it through a recorder on his desk
duncan never had the twitch that sometimes goes with it
and with duncan as i said the disease would only manifest itself in periods of extreme anxiety
when he was really flipping out in other words
there is a pause as monk fiddles with the tape recorder and clifford looks back down at the folder
duncan was catholic
beat so am i
mildly surprised that makes three of us
is that right
so we all share the same guilt
monk keeps fiddling
this is curt duncan shortly after he was admitted here in
monk turns on the tape recorder as clifford sits forward in his chair to listen
at first nothing can be heard
then there is a click as if the machine was turned on in the middle of a conversation to put the situation right
the hypodermic needles are only used to give you medication that will calm you down
they make you feel good relaxed
no answer were not putting anything in your food either
the food is just food
extremely agitated no
i dont eat the food
it doesnt taste right
to clifford thats duncan
clifford nods and keeps listening curt why are you fidgeting
cant you get comfortable
no im not comfortable
wait a hey
to someone else hold him down there
never mind the chair
there are scuffling noises underneath which can be heard heavy breathing and then getting louder and more furious duncan falling into the throes of guy du marraux
periodically interjecting pull him down
just lay him out
lay him right out
pull out his knees
finally monk is heard no more and duncan continues with the frightening verbal torrent of guy du marraux
sitting at his table inside the bar
he takes a long noisy drink from what looks like a bourbon on the rocks
it tastes good being the first real drink hes had in over six years
but duncan cannot relax enough to enjoy it fully
his eyes are ever restlessly suspiciously moving about
as bill walks up and stands next to tracy
hank moves off to get bill another beer
tracy looks up at bill and smiles
as regulars at the same bar they are loose and comfortable with each other
sotto voce a little action for your game
sotto voce what him
they both turn and look across the room at duncan
as bill and tracy look straight at him over their shoulders and then turn back
as they both smile at her joke
i wouldnt bet against you
whats the matter
you dont like me playing with myself
tracy grimaces as hank comes back with bills beer
bill picks up the bottle nods his thanks to hank and heads back to the pool table
as his eyes follow bill to the pool table then come back to tracy at the bar
looking at the back of tracy
she reaches into her purse
she takes her pack of cigarettes from the purse
she pulls out a cigarette taps it lightly on the bar puts it to her lips
we hear the sound of a match being struck
duncan is standing beside her holding a lit match
he shoves it forward at her
it goes out
duncan fumbles for another match as tracy regards him with undisguised repulsion
duncan gets the second match lit and holds it out for her
she accepts the favor and lights her cigarette
tracy nods and turns away
duncan is still holding the burning match for her to blow out
as it doesnt look like shes going to he lets it drop still lit to the floor
he gives a look as if to say jesus what a fuckin weirdo
duncan is still smiling at her
what you been up to
looking at him my own business
beat thanks for the light
the englishman sits down beside her but doesnt look at her
tracy looks away too determined to ignore him not to let him get into her space
after a long moment he turns back to her
next rounds on me
tracy keeps her eyes straight ahead acknowledging nothing
duncan takes some money from his pocket and lays it on the bar staring at her
tracy turns to him annoyed listen mister ive got my own money
so if you dont mind
she looks away again
after what i been through i dont mind anything
see thats the whole point
where do they fit in
you know what i mean
tracy abruptly picks up her purse and moves down the bar away from him one seat then another seat
they are watching this little spectacle with growing curiosity
still looking at her
by pointing at what she has he orders two more drinks from the bartender
when they arrive he takes a big swallow from one picks up the other stands moves down the bar and sits beside tracy again
setting her drink before her do you live around here
get offa me
even bill now looks up from the pool table
his expression darkens
tracy has clammed up her elbows on the bar head between her elbows arms covering her ears hands clasped behind her neck
duncan looks at her nervously and starts to talk again rapidly listen i didnt mean nothin
i dont live around here
i think the lady wants to be left alone
duncan looks up
bill enters the frame and stands in front of tracy confronting duncan
looking up at bill his eyes red his gaze unsteady
the air is charged with tension
i think an apology is in order
duncan doesnt know how to handle this
he looks at bill half shrugs half smiles
that the best you can do
duncan looks away
a long moment passes
i think youd better just move along pal
duncan doesnt move says nothing
he swallows hard
hell be okay now bill
he just no
i want him out of here
the bartender steps back deciding to mind his own business
tracy gets up from her seat and cautiously moves even further down the bar
to duncan go on beat it
they glare at each other
the longer duncan sits there without moving without saying anything the angrier bill gets
as the tension builds
duncan looks away
im not going to say it again mister
duncan reaches for his drink but bill reacts quicker
with a swipe of his hand he knocks the glass off the bar and it shatters on the floor behind the bar
duncan sits there stunned not looking up
after a long moment duncan coughs
then he turns and looks at bill
he purses his lips
it looks like a nervous facial movement
then suddenly duncan spits at bill hitting him square in the face
before anyone can register whats happened bill lunges at duncan knocking him clean off the barstool and onto the floor
the fight is fast vicious and one sided from the very start
pinned to the floor on his back duncan flails his arms ineffectually like a panicked insect as bill holds him in place with a left handed grip on the collar
while his powerful right arm pumping up and down like a piston pounds into duncans face time and time again
duncans screams diminish into pathetic sickening groans and the others in the bar are compelled to avert their eyes from this brutal spectacle
hank has picked up a phone from beneath the bar and is dialing a number
he turns away from the fight to talk
then as suddenly as bill first sprang at duncan he leaps to his feet and turns to the bar
he reaches over and grabs the phone from hank slamming it down into the cradle
whore you calling
bill takes the cloth from the bar and vigorously wipes his face off
he snaps his fingers and points to a row of bottles on a shelf behind the bar
hank quickly hands him a bottle
bill pours himself a shot and downs it fast
he is still charged with adrenaline and he takes two more shots in rapid succession spilling the alcohol on the bar and on himself
as bill picks up the cloth to wipe himself off again tracy stands up and quickly walks out of the bar slamming the door behind her
calling after her youre welcome baby
then he throws down the cloth picks up the bottle turns and standing over duncans inert form empties half the bottle onto him
he sets the bottle back on the bar
he grabs duncan and half dragging hurries him out the back door and throws him into the alley where duncan falls in a heap
bill storms back up to the bar and pours himself another drink
to hank okay
hank just looks at him doesnt answer
at the wifes silent insistence the elderly couple stand up to go
good riddance to bad rubbish eh bill
bill doesnt answer and the couple quietly leave
apologetic a fight breaks out theres gonna be damages
insurance company doesnt pay without a police report
you see any damages
hank lowers his gaze to the floor
bill finishes his drink
he is still very hopped up
he pulls a few dollars from his wallet and drops them on the counter
see ya round
he turns and strides out of the bar
camera holds for a beat on hank alone now in his empty establishment
the phone starts to ring presumably the police calling back
after several rings hank picks up the phone and listens
into phone no its over now
all the lights are out inside the house but we should just be able to see that we are in the hall looking at the front door
footsteps approach on the walk outside
a key slips into the lock
inside the house we can hear faint whispering
someone is moving about in the darkness
then the door swings open and the shadowy figure of a man crosses the threshold
he stops just inside
calling out donna
under his breath what the hell
suddenly the lights come on and a chorus of voices cry out a broad smile breaks across the mans face
we may recognize him as the cop from six years ago charles garber
today he is a lieutenant on the force and dresses casually for work usually in slacks turtleneck and jacket
genuinely surprised what is all this
happy birthday charlie
garber looks sheepishly at his hand holding the pistol hed drawn just before the lights came up
look at him
dont shoot us charlie
chagrined how was i supposed to know
everybody starts to laugh including garber as he returns the pistol to his shoulder holster
she comes out of the kitchen carrying a birthday cake with lit candles and makes her way through the crowd of guests singing happy birthday
everyone joins in as donna moves forward and stands beside her husband
clifford is one of the guests
he has his arm around a young blond who is sort of pretty despite her tacky plastic appearance
when the song is over garber blows out the candles and hugs and kisses his wife
the party is still in full swing
garber is following clifford up the stairs
they are both fairly loaded by now
garber in particular has reached that stage of inebriation where standing still is pretty hard to do
will you tell me what this is about cliff
yeah in a minute
i dont think i can take any more of these surprises
as clifford and garber enter
garber turns on a light as clifford closes the door shutting out the sounds of the party below
okay now whats the big deal
i want you to remember this in the morning
if you want me to remember something in the morning then tell it to me in the morning
garber half comically turns to go
clifford stops him
charlie come on
a baby between a year and two years old is lying in a crib
it opens its eyes and starts looking around
all right all right
what is it
youre getting married
i got a job today tracking someone
garber still moving restlessly pats his friend on the shoulder
thats great cliff im sure youll find your man
its curt duncan
garber stops suddenly stunned
in an instant he has become stone sober
kicking and wiggling about
you didnt know he got out
the baby opens its mouth and starts to cry
garber glances over his shoulder at the baby then turns back to clifford
i need your cooperation on this one
it is late
the block is virtually deserted
across the street is the exterior of a bar the same bar duncan was in earlier
some people are coming out of the bar
it must be near closing time
the people turn left and walk away down the sidewalk
their voices diminish
a car passes
then the door to the bar opens again and a woman comes out onto the sidewalk
it is tracy
she turns to the right and starts to walk away
he is standing in shadows across the street watching her
a series of shots of tracy walking home
the camera remains consistently behind her or off to one side sometimes dollying with her behind a row of parked cars sometimes picking up her passing reflection in a darkened
the impression this gives is unmistakable
curt duncan is following her
we do not see him we do not hear him yet we know he is there
often we can sense that the very angle from which we see tracy is his pov
but tracy is aware of nothing
we know this when the camera begins to move in front of her once more becoming an impersonal observer of her walk homeward to safety
tension mounts as we start to expect that duncan will jump out at her from every alley and recessed doorway she passes
but he doesnt
finally tracy walks up to the camera at the end of a block and turns a corner but the camera holds on the dark street she has just come up
we hear a cough which confirms that duncan is lurking somewhere in the shadows
tracy walks up the steps and enters the apartment
tracy steps into the elevator
the doors close
camera holds on the elevator and watches the lights above it travel from one to six
we hear the door to the apartment building open and close
tracy steps out of the elevator and walks down the hall to her door
she fumbles through her purse for keys then bends over the lock to let herself in
behind her down the hall duncan appears
he watches her starts to move silently forward
tracy gets the door open then turns and sees him
oh its you
beat what do you want
moving forward came to apologize
look im the one who should be sorry
i didnt want that to happen
she sees his face shudders oh god
look at you
are you all right
duncan half shrugs half smiles
tracy edges into her door way
duncan stands opposite her
im new in town
dont know anybody
uncomfortable wherere you from
coughs new york
ever been there
sure ive been there
they look at each other
duncan coughs again
kind of a mean place to be
everyone cold unfriendly
inside tracys apartment the telephone rings
tracy turns vaguely indecisively and goes to answer it
over her shoulder excuse me
she disappears into the apartment
she picks up the ringing phone
as she sits with the telephone
nervous no i just got in
i dont know if i can
listen i cant talk now
can i call you back
she hangs up the phone stands and turns back toward the door
duncan is standing right behind her
im not from new york actually
but im very very far from home
he sits down
look you cant come in here
duncan looks at her for a moment then looks about the apartment
mumbling i thought we might get some coffee
can i buy you
i dont think so
youd better go
i got no place to go
anxious you cant just just a little coffee
i said maybe
i dont know
beat listen im sorry about this afternoon
i really am
that was my boyfriend on the phone
hes coming over
so please leave
duncan doesnt move
he smiles at her
i like you
her voice rising look do you want me to call the cops
standing its okay
he backs to the doorway and pauses
ill see you later
i still want to buy you that drink
he steps into the hall
tracy closes the front door and bolts it
she turns leans against it and sighs
outside the door duncans footsteps move down the hall pause then come back to the door
a moment passes
then there is a faint knocking on the door
tracy doesnt move
the knocking comes again a little louder this time
tracy stands and waits scarcely breathing
after another long moment the footsteps finally move away
a car pulls into the parking lot behind the station
clifford and garber get out and walk into the building
clifford and garber walk down a hallway
uniformed policemen walk to and fro around them
jesus i dont recognize anybody
three years is a long time in a place like this
three and a half
garber stops at the watch commanders desk and picks up some paperwork
the wc looks up briefly and sees clifford
the wc looks down again
three and a half years mean nothing to him
taken aback hi
he cant remember the mans name
garber smiles at him and they continue walking
how long will you be here
depends on how lucky i get
beat ill only be coming around once maybe twice a week
you want to use your old desk
someplace to sit down
surprised is it vacant
clifford and garber appear in the doorway
clifford enters walks up to his old desk opens some of the drawers they are empty sits down in his old chair smiles at garber
we see clifford opening a file cabinet and taking out a folder stuffed with notices and reports c
clifford standing beside a xerox machine running off a copy of something d
clifford standing in a hallway talking to a patrolman
clifford has a legal pad with him and is jotting something down on it as the patrolman speaks e
clifford at his desk making notes on the legal pad f
garber is at his desk on the phone clifford appears in the doorway carrying his legal pad
he waves goodbye to garber who nods in response
clifford questions the desk clerk
he shows the clerk a photo of duncan taken some years ago in the mental institution
the clerk shakes his head and starts to hand the picture back when clifford motions for him to keep it
as clifford leaves the clerk turns the picture over
revealing cliffords name and phone numbers and a twenty dollar bill paperclipped to the back of the picture as clifford pulls his car up to the curb then consults his
legal pad the top three addresses are crossed out
clifford underlines the fourth clifford looks up from the pad to a bar he has pulled up in front of the bar duncan was in
it bears the address clifford has just underlined
clifford gets out of his car and walks up to the bar
a closed sign is displayed in the window
clifford knocks on the door
after a moment hank opens the door
there are only a few customers sitting around waiting for their wash
a bum is stretched out on his back across one of the tables like a corpse awaiting autopsy
this is cheater
a maintenance man in grey work clothes enters from the back
he opens a broom closet takes out a bucket and mop and rolls them toward the front of the laundromat
he stops at cheaters table and shakes him hard
okay man move it out
cheater sits up and starts to pull himself together
an old woman sitting against the wall points down one of the aisles of washing machines and says to the maintenance man theres another one down there
the maintenance man goes to the end of the aisle and looks down into the nook created by the absence of one of the washing machines
he nudges at whatevers inside the nook with his foot
nudging again come on bright eyes
wake jesus christ
what happened to you
as curt duncan raises his head into the light and looks up at the maintenance man
overnight his face has swollen considerably and a bright yellow and purple discoloring around his bruises has emerged
you get hit by a truck or what
he bends over and helps pull duncan to his feet
as the maintenance man guides duncan to the door
im sorry man but you cant stay in here
go out to the park lay in the sunshine
youll feel better
duncan goes out the door
the maintenance man turns and sees cheater stretched out again on the table
god bless it
he pulls cheater off the table and pushes him to the door
as cheater is pushed out onto the sidewalk
angry all right
he straightens his rags indignantly then looks at duncan and grins
whaddya say pardner
im dry as a bone
you got any money
duncan looks at cheater distrustfully and shakes his head
you neither huh
with a laugh my name is morgan but it aint j
guess i better go to work
take er easy now pardner
cheater shuffles off in one direction
duncan turns and goes in the other
a knock at the front door
after a moment tracy comes into the front hallway and crossing to the door stubs her toe on the open closet door
she swears under her breath and angrily slams the closet door shut
then grabbing her injured toe she hops to the front door
who is it
my names john clifford
im a private investigator
a private detective
what do you want with me
id just like to talk ask a few questions
ive got nothing to say about anything or anybody
listen lady i can be back in thirty minutes with a search warrant and a handful of cops and i can probably have you arrested whether or not the charges
now do you want to let me in and talk
have you got a badge
ill show you a badge when you open the goddamn door
tracy unbolts the door and opens it
clifford walks right in and closes the door behind him
i dont carry a badge
im issued a license a piece of paper and i left it at home
youre tracy fuller
can we sit down
tracy leads him into the living room
clifford gives her a picture
do you recognize this man
clifford lets out a sigh of frustration realizing that this woman will continue to be difficult
hes escaped from the insane asylum
in he murdered two children
broke into a house and found them asleep in bed
it was a little boy five an a half and a little three year old girl
after the coroners investigation their bodies were taken to the mortuary where the undertaker took one look at them and said he couldnt have their bodies reconstructed for the funeral
without six days of steady work
then he asked what had been the murder weapon because looking at the mess in front of him he couldnt imagine what had been used
the coroner told him there had been no murder weapon
the killer had used only his hands
beat the undertaker went to work and had them done in four
the picture falls out of tracys hands
she is stunned to the point of nausea
whats the matter
barely able to say it hes been here
duncan is standing on the sidewalk huddled close to a wall
he is looking up at tracys apartment building across the street
traveling up the wall of the building to the open window of tracys apartment on the sixth floor
slow zoom in do you think hell try to see you again
i dont know
he said he had no place else to go
lets play it safe
lets assume that he will
reacting to this possibility
will you work with me
she nods hesitantly
duncan turns up an alley across the street from tracys apartment building and disappears
sound over knocking on a door
clifford is standing at the door
the closed sign still hangs in the window
the door opens and hank sticks his head out
what are your hours tonight
bars closed on mondays
i want you to be open if thats possible
closing the door no way
mondays my night off
come back tomorr
clifford violently pushes the door open
the bartender backs off surprised
through clenched teeth this is tomorrow
now what are your hours
garber is sitting behind his desk as clifford walks in
looking up any luck
ive come to say goodbye and thank you
you found him
i think so
from here on i go it alone
whats the point of chancing it cliff
well let you take the credit
clifford sits down
im going to kill him charlie
garber leans forward in his chair and stares at clifford
a long moment passes
a button on the lieutenants phone lights up and the intercom buzzes
garber doesnt even look down at it
the button flashes on and off on and off
finally it stops
the closer i get to this guy the more i
it gets to me
i dont know
i think youd better go on home cliff
youve fallen in
not this time
this is the case that makes up for a whole career
if you cant understand it now you will in a few years
garber considers another tack and follows it
what part does money play in all this
play straight with me
clifford is stunned by the question but he tries to be casual
shrugging for what im being paid its not out of line
whos hired you for this
clifford glares at his friend and doesnt answer
cynically so youre a hitman now
passionately he murdered two kids in cold blood
you were there too
garber doesnt have to be reminded of his own feelings
he doesnt pursue the argument
you could get busted
i understand that
what are you going to use
garber nods slowly considering it a good choice of weapons at least
youre stretching our friendship cliff
if you blow this at all youll never hear from me again
garber looks away for a moment
when he looks back he just shrugs his shoulders washes his hands
take your time
do it right
do you need any help preparing for this thing
standing up im ready
im just trying to think where he could be in the meantime
a few customers sit quietly minding their own business
a waitress leans near the cash register at one end of the counter
a transistor radio plays country music blues
the waitress looks up as somebody enters
what happened to you
it is duncan
he moves to the counter and sits
you get mugged
snubbed the waitress comes back and sets the cup in front of him
she looks down at the change on the counter
there isnt enough
coffees twenty seven
duncan looks up at her resentfully
pulling away the cup coffees twenty seven cents
ya got it or dont ya
duncan glares at her
he doesnt have it
okay buster one cup
on the house
she pushes the cup back to him
some of the coffee spills onto the counter
drink it and be on your way
duncan slowly reaches for the cup raises it to his lips
duncan stops sets the cup down pushes it away from him and slowly rises from his seat
no thank you
duncan and the waitress stand face to face shooting darts at each other
then a man sitting two seats away reaches over and places a quarter on the counter between them
the waitress looks at the man irritatedly then picks up the money and moves away
duncan slowly sits down again
he pulls the cup back to himself then turns and looks at the man for a long moment unable to express his gratitude
a series of shots of bums homeless persons hanging out in alleys in the doorways of old buildings sitting on the sidewalk in front of liquor stores
then we see duncan alone but looking no different from the others
he is panhandling passersby without much success
we see him fall into a fit of coughing that incapacitates him for several seconds
hes obviously getting sicker
we lose sight of duncan as our montage continues
we see clifford talking to a bum then another
he is passing the time combing the streets in the neighborhood of the bar
a handful of bums are sitting together on the grass passing a bottle in a brown paper bag
duncan is not among them but cheater is there sitting at the end of the line
camera pans from one bum to the next as the bottle is passed
by the time it gets to cheater it is empty
cheater looks as if hes about to cry like a baby when a hand enters the frame from the other side the hand holding out to cheater a full bottle
cheater takes the bottle and looks up gratefully
to see john clifford standing beside him
i cant say much for your protocol but your timings dead on
heres to you pardner
cheater takes a long drink then passes the bottle back down the line
to all the bums im looking for an old buddy of mine english fella
names crazy curt
any of you guys seen him
i owe him some money
show me an honest man
gesturing stands about so
face kind of banged up
was in an accident
i was just with that guy not moren an hour ago
crazy curt huh
cheater scratches his head and glances anxiously down the line
hell i cant remember
probbly see him again though
tell you what
you leave the money with me ill see he gets it
as a favor to you
clifford shakes his head
i have to talk to him
you dont trust me
ill have you know i used to be a college professor
we can work together
clifford stands to go
the bottle comes back to cheater three quarters down
keep the bottle
ill be back
long life to the grape
for when summer is flown the age of our nectar shall gladden our own
thats shelley you know
clifford is gone
cheater takes a long drink and almost forgets that clifford was ever there
clifford is suiting up for his nights work
he is dressed casually blue jeans shirt open at the neck sports jacket adidas running shoes
he looks at himself in the mirror is satisfied
then he picks up from the dresser two awl like instruments with short handles and long glistening tapered needlepoints his weapons
he slides them into a leather sheath inside his jacket and turns to go
it is lit up inside
the bar is open for business
across the street in a dark space between two buildings duncan is waiting watching the front door of the bar to see who comes out
the place is empty but for hank who half watches the television over the bar and tracy who sits alone in a corner
several moments pass as both of them sit and wait
then the front door starts to swing open
someone is coming in
tracy and hank both glance nervously toward the door
a mans head peeks in
he is somewhere in his forties a regular customer
hey hank whatre you doing open tonight
relaxing trying to make a buck
the customer walks up to the bar sits down and talks quietly with hank
tracy looks nervously at her wristwatch
she stubs out her cigarette takes one last gulp of her drink and stands up to go
she walks to the bar opens her purse and reaches inside
keep it honey
they exchange a meaningful look
then she heads for the door
under his breath that how you make a buck
tracy looks up and down the street hoping to see clifford somewhere afraid of glimpsing duncan instead
then she starts walking quickly homeward
following tracy to her apartment
we pick up clifford now and we cut back and forth between the two of them her walking quickly never looking back and him sneaking along several hundred feet behind
her looking everywhere for duncan whom we never see
she walks up the steps and enters
tracy steps off the elevator and goes to her door
she fumbles through her purse for the key
then she hears footsteps on the stairs
coming forward half whispering no luck
you see him
tracy shakes her head
he still could be out there though
softly oh god
she is starting to come apart and she suddenly leans on clifford for support
are you all right
tracy stands there for several seconds to regain control of herself
then she steps away and turns back to the door
im going to hang around outside for awhile
ill be back on and off again all night
tracy gets the door unlocked
she pushes it open
tracy steps in
clifford stays in the doorway
they are still whispering
are you sure youre okay
bolt your door
dont let anybody in no matter what
ill be seeing you
starts to move off comes back listen
tracy closes the door and throws the bolt
then she walks into the apartment and out of frame
camera stays in the hallway
we can hear tracy moving about o
then as if on its own the door to the hall closet slowly swings open
until we can see duncan standing inside the closet
tracy is putting some coffee on
then she removes her coat and walks out of the kitchen
tracy goes up to the closet with her coat
the door is closed
she opens it
she hangs up her coat and closes the door again
then she turns and starts walking out of the hallway to the living room
as she is rounding the corner into the living room she walks right into duncan
she barely has time to gasp before he clamps his hand over her mouth and pushes her against the wall
urgent whisper i just have to talk to you
pathetically i want you to be my friend
as she isnt struggling he starts to loosen up on her
he takes his hand away from her mouth lets go of her and slowly cautiously steps back
tracy looks at him for a breathless moment her eyes wild with fear
then she screams
duncan jumps back stunned frightened and confused
tracy doesnt move
she just keeps screaming hysterically
tracys screams carry out into the night as clifford races across the street and into the apartment building
duncan runs to a window throws it open and climbs out onto the fire escape
as clifford bounds up the stairs flight after flight and duncan tears down the fire escape
the screaming has stopped when clifford reaches tracys door
he grabs the doorknob and heaves himself against the door
its bolted shut
clifford pulls one of the needles from his jacket and hammers it into the lock
the bolt springs and clifford runs into the apartment
as clifford bursts in
tracy gestures toward the window
clifford runs to it and sticks his head out
duncan is gone
clifford runs to a window on another wall and looks out onto the street
no sign of the englishman
clifford runs out of the apartment yanking his needle from the lock as he passes the door and charges back down the stairs
tracy moves to the door and closes it
she is breathing heavily
we hear the angry sizzle of coffee spilling onto the hot stove as tracy goes to get it
clifford comes out looks around and moves rapidly up the street
duncan is hurrying along dodging in and out of people trying to move quickly but not draw attention to himself
clifford is travelling along the sidewalk crossing the street looking everywhere
duncan is running up the alley
he comes to a stop beside some piled up trash cans
he leans against the brick wall of the building huffing and puffing
he is frightened but he feels safe for now
he slowly slides down the wall to the ground
duncan is curled up in the corner of a bare cell with padded walls
he is in a strait jacket
his head is shaved
we cant tell what he is thinking except that hes obviously deeply frightened and cannot understand whats happening to him
this is the childrens bedroom in dr
mandrakis house of six years ago
it is dark
two small beds occupy one corner of the room
we can see two small lumps on the beds but no more
duncan sits in the foreground with a telephone on his lap
he is dialing a number
the phone rings three times before it is answered or rather picked up because there is no voice on the other end
after several seconds the phone is hung up
duncan hangs up and thinks for a moment
he picks up the phone and dials again
this time he gets a busy signal
he hangs up stands and goes to the door
he opens it slowly peers out
jills voice can be heard faintly talking to the operator asking for the police
duncan closes the door and comes back into the room mumbling
he goes to the window looks out
then he goes to the childrens beds
as he raises the covers and stares down into the camera
a freighter broad and low arduously cuts through the water
early morning mist hangs over the deck which is empty but for a lone figure standing on the prow
it is curt duncan
he is looking out over the front of the ship
another seaman comes up behind him and claps him on the shoulder
so this will be your first time
laughs an old salt like you
duncan moves away wanting to be left alone
still laughing slightly punchy youll love it here
its where they make the bombs
its where they make the planes that carry the bombs the planes we saw over singapore and manila
he walks away laughing
there she is
the coast of southern california emerges through the mist
a foghorn blows somewhere in the distance
as he peers ahead with inscrutable interest
a little boy is lying in bed apparently asleep
this is curt duncan as a child
some voices approach in the hallway outside the bedroom
they are gruff with heavy english accents but subdued a man and a woman well into middle age
the boys eyes open as he listens whats the matter
save it for later
lets go out and get some food
what about the lad
you cant leave him
hell never know were gone
from outside a key enters the lock of the bedroom door and turns
the bolt slips and the door is securely shut
the boy sits up in bed apprehensive
in tight shots of the floor we see a rat come out from under the bed then another
they make chit chit noises as they begin to explore
one of them maybe goes up on its hind legs and nibbles on the bedpost
then we see two more rats appear
we go for a tight shot of the boy on top of the bed
the chit chit noises grow steadily louder as the boys apprehension turns to fear then to terror
the boy starts to whimper
suddenly we cut back to a wide shot of the room
the floor is crawling with rats hundreds of them
the chit chit rises to practically a roar as the boy alone on top of the bed begins to wail
the room seems to darken and the boy becomes just a little white speck in it
the focus is turned
the picture becomes a black and white blur
at first all that can be seen is a white blur against a black screen
the previous sound of a boy crying increases
then the blur grows larger coming more into focus as the entire screen image moves toward normal definition
finally we know we are back in the alleyway that it is night and that the white blur is actually a little boy lost sobbing uncontrollably
awakening to the scene coming back to reality
he is confused
the boy continues sobbing moving about in little circles
duncan amazed at what he sees slowly crawls out from the wall on his hands and knees crawls toward the weeping child staring at it with a strange look on
suddenly the boy stops crying and looks at duncan quizzically hesitantly
they are less than a foot apart almost face to face
together they form a kind of frozen tableau
something close to sympathy crosses the killers expression and the boy likewise achieves a faint sense of recognition
then just as suddenly the boy starts wailing again and he runs off down the alleyway
duncan watches him disappear
then he slowly pulls himself to his feet
clifford is coming up the sidewalk
as clifford crosses the entrance to an alleyway the boy comes running out and almost collides with him
clifford grabs the boy and looks down at him
then he passes the wailing child off on a nearby pedestrian and runs up into the alley
duncan is hurrying along the sidewalk
something makes him look up
he is looking at a neon jesus saves sign above the doorway to an inner city mission
as he stares at the sign
hey crazy curt
duncan turns to see cheater elatedly hobbling up to him
hail fellow well met and all that jazz
its our lucky day
taking duncan by the arm a friend of yours got money for you
we got to get back to the park and meet him
duncan pulls his arm free
hell be comin for you crazy curt
sgot some money
reaching for duncans arm well get us a little joy juice
duncan pulls free again and heads toward the mission
you really are crazy
duncan enters the mission and cheater stands out on the sidewalk for a moment bitterly frustrated
blow winds and crack your cheeks
blow you cataracts and hurricanoes spout till you have drenchd our steeples and drownd the cocks
several pedestrians stop and gape at this sudden outburst
clifford comes out of a derelict hotel looks up and down the street and hurries off not giving up the chase
a man is leading duncan to the bathroom
duncan enters slowly and goes to one of the wash basins where there is an old razor blade and a can of shaving cream
duncan picks up the razor for a moment and looks at it
he is lost in thought
then he sets it down and turns on the tap water
he glances at himself in the mirror and is suddenly transfixed by his own image
he looks deeply into the mirror for several seconds
then he starts to cry and having begun a flood of emotions comes pouring out of him
he drops to his knees
the man comes running back into the bathroom
he holds duncan and helps pull him back to his feet
cheater is trudging along the sidewalk hands in pockets head lowered
he looks up and sees something that brings him back to life
clifford is standing on the corner up ahead looking around
cheater calls out and starts to run toward clifford
clifford turns sees cheater
the sleeping dorm
it is a large empty room
thirty or so outcasts are stretched out on the bare floor in the darkness
their combined snoring wheezing creates a steady ghastly din
the door at the far end of the hall opens
a figure steps in and quietly closes the door behind him
he stands for a moment taking in the scene letting his eyes adjust to the darkness
then he slowly creeps forward to the prone body of the nearest sleeper
it is clifford
he moves stealthily from one body to the next
in one hand he carries a small flashlight
he turns the bodies over just long enough to shine the light in their faces and identify who they are or rather who they are not
then he moves on
in his other hand he holds a small gleaming jimmy needle
hes sleeping but his eyes suddenly open sensing danger
he turns over and sees the dark figure of clifford slowly advancing toward him
clifford keeps coming closer and closer to where duncan lies
he is but six or seven bodies away when duncan jumps up suddenly and bolts for the door
clifford looks up sees the fleeing figure and charges after it
racing through a maze of narrow hallways duncan cant stop to think where hes going
clifford is barreling after him some forty yards behind
duncan rounds a corner and ten yards up ahead the hallway deadends in a set of double doors
duncan has no choice but to hurl himself against the doors
they yield and he goes through them
four seconds later clifford comes to the same doors and pushes through to the other side
as clifford comes through the doors which are a side entrance into the chancel of this large gothic style church
behind him now is the altar
before him stretches the nave of the edifice with its rows of pews its dimly glowing stained glass windows and way in the back its choir loft
at regular intervals tiny shafts of light pierce the darkness from on high
there is no sign of duncan but clifford knows he must be in here hiding somewhere
he slowly walks forward to the front of the chancel
its over now
come on out
duncan doesnt come out
clifford holds very still
he hears nothing
he speaks again and his voice echoes through the large empty church
my names john clifford
im a private detective
ive been hired by alexander mandrakis to take you back
im not going to hurt you
hiding beneath a pew
he hears the name mandrakis and it registers like a thunderbolt
he silently mouths the name mandrakis
then he hears cliffords footsteps approaching
slowly moving up the center aisle looking from side to side into the pews
gently coaxing im not going to hurt you
im not going to hurt you
therell be no more pain
youre safe now
clifford moves closer and closer to duncans row until finally duncan can bear it no longer
he jumps up from beneath the pew and runs
clifford chases him through the pews and up the aisles to the front of the church
he is clutching a needle in both hands ready to strike
duncan flees through a narrow door off to the side of the church
duncan faces a spiraling stone staircase
he has no choice but to climb them higher and higher the sound of cliffords angry footsteps always coming up behind him
finally duncan can climb no higher
he is at the top of the bell tower
a lanceted opening in the stone wall ahead of him looks out over the narrow shaft of the tower
above him are the huge iron bells
a rope hangs down from the bells dangling all the way down the shaft forty or fifty feet to the floor of the church
clifford is bounding up the last flight of steps to get him
duncan has little choice
he is trapped
just before clifford reaches him duncan leaps out into the shaft and catches the bell rope
the bell starts to clang as duncan hanging in mid air swings back and forth within the narrow shaft
clifford leans way out through the lancet window and takes a swipe at duncan but the madman is just beyond his reach and hurriedly climbing down the rope
clifford reaches out and tries to grab at the rope
at last he gets it and he shakes it violently to get duncan to lose his grip and be dashed against the stone floor below
but duncan holds firm climbing ever downward
the bell continues to clang sending its alarm out into the night
then clifford braces himself and slowly laboriously begins to haul up on the rope
clifford gains momentum until duncan is being pulled up faster than he is climbing down
still twenty feet off the ground duncan lets go of the rope and plummets to the hard stone floor
then people come rushing into the church awakened by the commotion of the bells
duncan rolls into the shadows and drags himself out a side door while clifford plans his own escape from the bell tower
clifford runs up the alleyway looks around and finally realizes hes lost his prey
duncan is hidden deep in the shadows of a nook between two buildings catching his breath
camera moves in on him and we see him looking the craziest hes ever been
he shakes uncontrollably and begins to mumble softly at first then getting louder
hes falling back into the grips of guy du marraux
all is still and quiet as soft warm sunlight pours into the dirty streets and alleyways
in the background the bell tower of the church rises above the skyline
we see a shot of the park all the bums are asleep
then a shot of the mission its front door open the sidewalk empty
then the bar where the same peaceful mood prevails
then the alleyway where we last saw curt duncan
now he is gone
then the exterior of tracys apartment building
cliffords car is parked out front
i used to see my two kids every weekend
they lived in a nice house with their father outside the city
tracy and clifford are sitting at a small table in the kitchen looking haggard drinking coffee
its been years
theyre grown up
they look at each other
clifford is a sympathetic listener
i look at where i am now
i know i couldve done better but
its too late for that
quietly i know
well youve got to keep looking i suppose
taking his cue clifford slowly rises
i dont think hell come back here
tracy looks up at him questioningly wishing she could feel as sure about it as he does
extending his hand thanks
for all your help
tracy takes his hand
they shake warmly
i know it wasnt easy
turning to go maybe someday ill be able to
i wish you wouldnt leave me altogether
clifford turns back to her
with a laugh im not a young woman anymore
ive given up all my dreams of the future
now i just want to make it to the end
you know what i mean
clifford smiles at her gently
he knows exactly what she means
ill be around
clifford takes a few steps turns back looks at her
you like ice cream
clifford nods his head slightly as if registering this in his memory
they smile at each other for a second then clifford leaves and tracy sits alone in her kitchen listening to him go hearing the door close behind him
close up on a section of a newspaper lying in the gutter
a pair of feet enters the frame and stands beside the newspaper
we hear a familiar cough
then a trembling hand reaches down and picks up the newspaper
something in the newspaper has caught his eye
then the feet shuffle out of frame
a modest middle income neighborhood where young married couples buy their first home and start their family
camera is facing down the quiet street
in the foreground on the street two small children a little boy and a little girl are playing
they are adorable kids
camera pans ninety degrees with the children as they run out of the street and up the sidewalk to their house
a title appears across the bottom of the screen pm friday april title fades as the children push open the front door and enter the house
they noisily and excitedly make their way to the kitchen
the children are four and two and a half years old stevie and june respectively
as the kids enter their mother is working at the stove her back to camera
together hi mommy
the mother turns around
it is jill johnson
smiling well look what the wind blew in
camera moves in on her as she comes forward bends down kisses stevie and picks up june
jill looks older more mature but still very pretty
she is mrs
john lockhart now and has left her memories of the past behind her

a wall phone in the kitchen starts to ring
stevie goes to answer it

well well look for it real hard later

as jill hangs up the phone stevie pipes up o

cliffords car is parked in the driveway and we see him getting out
he goes to the front door the porch light is on and perhaps one other lamp somewhere inside the otherwise dark house
he rings the bell waits rings again
finally the door is opened by the houseboy
mandrakis are out of town
for how long

will you be here
clifford takes a business card from his pocket and gives it to the houseboy
call if you need me
the houseboy reads the card as clifford walks back to his car
then the houseboy closes the front door
clifford pauses beside his car for a moment looking back at the rich dark home
the children are in bed
jill is sitting next to stevie
only a nightlight is on
i pray the lord my soul to keep
if i die before i wake i pray the lord my soul to take
god bless mommy and daddy and

jill stands up and goes over to junes bed
what is it
jill bends closer to her daughter
the doorbell rings
i love you

kissing her goodnight
jill stands up and leaves
as jill comes down the stairs
carol the sitter is at the foot of the stairs with john
carol has an armful of schoolbooks
i saw your picture in the paper the other day
wasnt it a dreadful picture
i thought it was nice
jill crosses to a hall table picks up a phone book flips through it then writes on a notepad beside the phone
over this action

to carol give them about twenty minutes and then take a peek but if stevie sees you youll have to tell him a story

honey in ten seconds i eat the staircase
she puts down the pad and crosses to a closet where she takes out a lightweight coat
handing the coat to john here
not taking the coat im not wearing that thing
jill shoves the coat into his stomach
smiling he takes the coat and dutifully helps her on with it
have a good time
pulling her out the door bye carol
john and jill walk to the station wagon in the driveway as carol shuts the front door in the background
just before jill gets into the car she takes a look back at the house there is a moments hesitance and then she gets in the car
carol picks up the phone and carries it into the living room with her
as she does it we see lying on the phone table the newspaper clipping with jills picture and headline jill lockhart chairs community unicef drive
she puts the phone down then her books then herself
she dials a number
her boyfriend answers
can you come over
i really have a lot of work to do
an italian restaurant
quiet music soft lights red and white checkered tablecloths candles a smokey and seductive atmosphere
dolly with a latin waiter carrying a huge tray of food over head
he passes right by the table where jill and john are sitting
john watches him take the food to someone else
reaching for a breadstick ive eaten enough breadsticks to turn into a pretzel
john tell me about the surprise
i got the sack today
i was fired
you dont believe me
no i dont believe you
well wally did call me into his office today
and he did tell me i didnt have my old job anymore
getting excited john what did you get

beside herself john i dont believe it
district sales manager
the waiter arrives with their food
well its about time
the waiter looks up offended
to waiter not you
back to john its about time they recognized you for what you are
enjoy your dinner folks
they ignore him
he moves away
john digs right in
mouth full ill be the youngest district manager in the companys history
god am i hungry
not eating yet does this mean a raise

john flags down a passing waiter and signals that their wine glasses need filling
john leans forward and whispers in her ear
and a car
and a car
john im so proud of you
john pauses looks at her
whats the matter
you dont like your food
the maitre d has come up to the table
john stops suddenly
they are both very chagrined
theres a telephone call for you
john starts to get up
jill grabs his arm
eat your dinner
its probably carol
ill talk to her
jill stands up and follows the maitre d through the other tables to the telephone
she picks up the receiver
camera moves in on her
have you checked the children
jill screams and falls to the floor
around him other diners fall instantly silent and wonder what is going on
waiters stop dead in their tracks
john leaps up from his seat and dashes through the tables like a madman
suddenly the restaurant comes alive with excitement and alarm
as john runs up and drops to his knees beside her
she is shaking and sobbing uncontrollably
jill whats happening
it was him
somebody call the police
other people have crowded around and are making urgent noises now about calling the police an ambulance etc
john tries to cut through the confusion and anxiety
wait a minute
just hold on
sweetheart what was him
what are you talking about
hes home again
hes got our children
he was on the phone
john grabs the telephone and quickly dials a number
the crowd tries to quiet down as much to hear for themselves as to let john talk
the phone rings and rings
hello carol its mr
whats going on over there
nothings going on
is everything all right
yes theres nothing are you sure
carol listen to me very carefully
if theres a man in the house if theres any reason why you cant talk to me right now just answer yes to me over the phone
if theres any danger of any kind just say yes
they wait for her answer
jill is listening into the receiver now too
i dont understand whats happening
what man in the house
jill is confused
john breathes a guarded sigh of relief
jill takes the phone
carol its mrs
answer me truthfully
when was the last time you looked in on the children
about forty five minutes ago
they were fast asleep
jill gives her husband a look
john takes the phone again
carol im sorry about all the hysterics
were leaving the restaurant now
well explain everything when we get home
before we hang up could you do just one more thing for me please
would you go upstairs and and check on the children for me
jill is violently shaking her head
john silences her with a gesture
puts the phone down
then there is silence on the other end
the crowd of people around jill and john begin to shuffle and murmur
john tries to keep them quiet while listening into the phone
then two policemen come forward through the crowd
one of them kneels down to john and jill who are still on the floor
what seems to be the problem here sir
whispering officer im john lockhart
just a second please and ill explain everything
whispering to policeman im jill johnson the babysitter seven years ago with the child killer
this means nothing to policeman
the guy got into the house and killed the two children upstairs
policeman kneels down now
whispering oh yeah i remember something about that
a greek doctor
thats the one
to policeman it was in the seventh precinct
as the two policemen and john mumble between themselves jill takes the telephone
she presses the receiver tighter to her ear
john quiets down the policeman
jill can now hear what she couldnt a second ago
growing hysterical carol
zoom into the telephone until we can also hear what jill is reacting to
it grows louder and louder
a dial tone
john and jill pull up in the station wagon followed by a squad car no sirens or lights
they all get out and rush for the front door
john pulls out his key to open the door
and discovers that its unlocked
cautiously they step inside
they look into the living room
carol isnt there
the policemen tentatively draw their guns
jill bolts up the stairway
policeman runs up after her
as jill runs down to the childrens bedroom followed by policeman
she opens the door and rushes inside
the children are in bed asleep
policeman stands in the doorway as jill goes up to june and bends over her
opening her eyes mommy
jill kisses her gently on the forehead
june closes her eyes and immediately falls back to sleep
jill walks over to stevies bed and looks down at him
he turns slightly in his sleep
satisfied that her children are safe jill pulls up the covers on stevie and then walks slowly out of the bedroom
jill quietly pulls the door shut and policeman walks back up the hallway
jill leans against the wall and buries her face in her hands
she is drained
she starts to cry
nothing was wrong
when i got back to the phone the line was dead
i figured we got cut off somehow
whats been going on
jill is sitting on a corner of the bed looking at the floor
john sits on the other corner facing away from her slowly unbuttoning his shirt
after a long silence
what are you thinking about
if i ever get my hands on the guy that made that call
john it wasnt a prank
i know that voice
he disguised it though didnt he
same as before
i know that voice
how can we just sit here
john turns and moves over beside her
look we promised never to talk about this
reaction shot of jill
she is shocked
what are we supposed to do
take the kids and lock ourselves up somewhere
lets get a good nights sleep and in the morning we can rethink this whole thing
nothing has to be rethought
and im not about to fall asleep
try to relax honey
were both here
the house is locked up
the copsll be just outside all night long
were safe now
thats what they told me before
john stands up and goes to his dresser
if itll make you feel any better
he takes a revolver from the dresser drawer and emphatically checks the action
then he walks to his side of the bed and sets the pistol on his bedside table
ill keep it right here beside me all night
you know im a light sleeper and a damn good shot
are you satisfied
jill tries to smile
john im sorry to be putting you through all this
hey youre not putting me through anything that you dont have to go through yourself
im with you all the way
john leans forward and kisses her
thats my girl
he gets up and walks out of the room talking
now try to relax
well get some sleep
youll be surprised how differently things will look in the morning
not so loud
youre going to wake the children
john comes back into the bedroom with a glass of water and a couple of pills in his hand
those kidsd sleep through an earthquake
theyre good kids
handing her the pills and water here take a couple of these
theyre just what the doctor ordered
as she takes the pills and swallows them one at a time
you know i read somewhere about this psychological thing called hysterical delusion or hysterical recall or something
it had to do with how an event from your past can sneak up on you sometimes and fool you when its only just a memory
i dont know
well talk about it in the morning
maybe theres someone we can see about that
the lounge area in the back of the station
at one table three officers are playing bridge
garber with his back to camera rounds out their game
at a nearby table closer to camera policeman is working on a crossword puzzle
policeman sitting next to him is reading a paperback novel
whats a word for an outsider of sorts
starts with an i
policeman thinks briefly then goes back to his novel
policeman enters the room carrying a printout of some sort
a report just came in on that guy curt duncan
at the bridge table perking up his ears looking around
broke outta the nuthouse two months ago
garber is keeping only half an eye on the card game
he pulls a card from his hand and throws it down
you going to put that in our report
diamonds was led
garber hastily picks up his card and throws down another
course im going to put it in the report
maybe this gal tonight really did get a call from him
your lead charlie
garber throws down another card
what the hell are you doing
thats a trump
a card laid is a card played
yeah youre right
wed better leave that on ruzniks desk in the morning

jesus kay reist
garber throws down his cards
he stands up and approaches policeman
hey tucker lemme see that a minute
policeman hands the sheet of paper to garber
garber quickly scans the information
you guys have a stake on the house
bernstein and waller are checkin it every twenty minutes or so
handing back the sheet thanks
garber exits to his office
policeman walks over to where policeman is still sitting working the crossword
hey whats an eight letter word for an outsider of sorts
starts with an i
garber sits thinking for a moment
he is trying to come to a decision
he reaches for the phone and dials
it rings and then is picked up
i think i got something for you
a shot of the downstairs hall
all is dark and still very still
jill is tossing in her sleep
john is fast asleep next to her on his side facing away from her
then jill wakes up
she is heavily sedated groggy
she hardly knows where she is at first
she pulls herself up to a sitting position on the side of the bed
she tries to gather her wits
then she gets up and walks slowly out of the room
through the upstairs hallway down the staircase and toward the kitchen
the darkness around her is ominous threatening
she stops at the dining room window and looks out
on the street a patrol car slowly passes and disappears down the block
jill enters turns on the light opens a cupboard and takes out a glass
she goes to the refrigerator and opens it
suddenly the lights go out
jill closes the refrigerator door and goes and turns on another light
apparently only a lightbulb has blown
jill unscrews the burned out bulb from its socket and throws it in the trash
she leaves the kitchen
jill walks to a hall closet and opens it
a light comes on inside as she does so
a puzzled half startled expression comes onto her face
inside the closet half the hangers with coats etc
are on the floor
sound over a telephone being dialed
clifford has just finished dialing the phone
he waits nothing happens
then a strange siren like noise comes out of the telephone
clifford listens then hangs up
he picks up the
he has lying on the desk and idly starts flipping the cartridge chamber with one of his jimmy needles
after a moment he lays the gun down and picks up the phone again this time calling the operator
can you dial a local number for me
what is the number please
the operator dials
there is a pause
then the same strange noise cuts in
operator what does that mean
im sorry sir that line seems to be disconnected
why dont i get a recording
i dont know sir
maybe the number was just recently disconnected
maybe theres a temporary malfunction in the wiring
why dont you try it again in the morning
jill is walking down the hall to the childrens bedroom
she opens the door
as jill quietly enters
the children are asleep
jill goes to june and tucks her in
then she walks over to stevies bed
he is sleeping but with a sugar daddy in his hand
jill looks down at him again puzzled
she leans over takes the sugar daddy and gently wakes him
stirring but not fully awake yes
stevie listen to me
where did you get this candy
where did you get this
very groggy the man gave it to me
drifting off i dont know
wings on a horse
he closes his eyes and is asleep
jill stands up turns and starts to walk out of the room
halfway across the floor jill stops
she stands rigid as a thought penetrates her own drowsiness
she turns very slowly and moves to the closet in the childrens bedroom
she stands before it a moment
then she reaches her hand forward for the knob on the closet door
she very slowly pulls the door open
she looks inside
there is nothing
jill quietly closes the closet door and leaves the room
john is still asleep facing the wall
jill gets into bed sitting up
she is wide awake now
she sits for a moment in the darkness thinking
then she reaches for the princess phone on the bedside table
she doesnt get a dial tone
she quietly pushes the phones disconnect button up and down several times
still no dial tone
jill hangs up and thinks for another moment apprehension creeping over her face
then in the darkness of the bedroom she begins to hear the muttering of a mans voice low and deep
it is duncan in the throes of guy du marraux
as the voice gets steadily louder and more menacing her attention focuses on the door to the bedroom closet which is a couple of inches ajar
urgently whispering john
she reaches for the bedside lamp and turns it on never taking her eyes away from the closet door
as soon as the light comes on the voice stops
her eyes still riveted to the door jill grabs her husbands shoulder and shakes him her voice cracking with fear
the body beside her stirs rolls over looks at her hideously
it is duncan
jill shrieks and makes a move to leap out of the bed
duncan the hideous and terrifying sound of his madness grumbling out of his throat manages to grab the back of her nightgown
as jill struggles to get off the bed the gown rips slightly while she fights to get away
duncan rolls to her side of the bed and manages to grab jills ankle while letting go of the gown
it causes jill to lose her balance and tumble onto the floor just short of the doorway leading out of the room
duncan is on her in a flash clutching at her and moving his hands for her throat
jill screams again
it is the desperate sound of a woman facing certain death
suddenly two quick shots ring out overwhelming all other sound
duncan falls back with a groan and a thud
out of the darkness of the hallway steps clifford pistol in hand
he crosses to duncan
he is dead
then clifford walks around the room to the far side of the bed and looks down
on the narrow strip of floor between the bed and the wall lies john
clifford nudges the body with his foot
john stirs as if he has been knocked unconscious but it will be some time yet before he comes to
clifford starts to walk out of the room stepping over duncans body edging past jill who is propped up in the doorway sobbing hysterically
your husbands okay
then he is gone
as jill sits there unable to rein in her emotions june and stevie toddle up to her groggily from the hallway
jill clutches her children to her heaving breast and buries her face between them
looking through the open front doorway into the quiet night beyond
