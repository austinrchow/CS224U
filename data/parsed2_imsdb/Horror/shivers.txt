screenplay by david cronenberg starliner towers is seen in ls through the windshield of a moving car
the car approaches the complex and stops near the main doors of the west tower
out of the car climb kresimir and benda sviben a gawky newly wed young couple
kresimir elaborately opens the door for benda his new wife and they walk with hands intertwined up the steps of the west tower
as the svibens approach the main doors the doorman leaps up from his chair beside the intercom switchboard and opens the door for them
the doorman like most security guards does not look capable of handling a serious crisis
he is about fifty of average height but slightly built wears thick glasses and seems almost embarrassed by the revolver on his hip
can i help you
are looking for the rental agent here
we have an appointment
ok ill just give him a little buzz and hell come out and show you the way in
the doorman presses a button on the intercom board
as he turns back to the svibens he catches his holster on the board
freeing holster darned thing
do you ever use that
no never even had it out of the holster
a rival company has em so we gotta have em
just an advertising gimmick
emil hobbes a huge florid bearded man is strangling annabelle horsefield
despite the difference in their sizes annabelle is tall and slender about seventeen hobbes is not having an easy time of it
hobbes is wearing overlarge blue jeans and a red plaid shirt annabelle is in a private girls school outfit white blouse dark blue tie blue knee socks pleated gray skirt
annabelle fights back fiercely hobbes has tears in his eyes
the struggle takes them all over her apartment which although sparsely furnished presents enough objects in their way to cause a lot of crashing around
at one point annabelle breaks loose and hobbes has to chase her
annabelle slips and hobbes manages to pin her to the ground where he has the advantage of leverage
he strangles her quickly and with tremendous crazy energy
blood oozes from her mouth
hobbes places his hand over her mouth as though trying to prevent her from speaking or to prevent something from leaving her body
he reaches over to his leather doctors bag which has spilled some of its contents on to the floor finds a surgical clamp and clamps annabelles lips together
he then picks up her body carries it over to the dining room table and sweeps the few cups and bottles on it off on to the floor
he then places her body with great tenderness on the table and begins to undress it
the doorman leaves the svibens to open the door for the spergazzis an elderly italian couple who both use aluminum four pronged canes to help them walk
the svibens watch the old couple as they enter and then glance at each other significantly well be together when were as old as they are
spergazzi tips his hat to the doorman who opens the inner door for him
as the spergazzis make their way shakily toward the elevators mr
merrick the rental agent appears from around a corner
he is slick mustachioed and wears a wide paisley tie
he extends his hand for a handshake even though he is still fifty feet from the inner doors
the doorman keeps the door open for him
hell take you on in
ingratiatingly welcome to starliner towers
and you are
kresimir and benda sviben
oh yes of course
come right this way
sorry to keep you waiting
now are we talking about one or two bedrooms
i assume were not talking about bachelors eh
now i have several floor plans all laid out for you and all you have to do is take your choice and well trot right on up there and take
a look at em
the three disappear around a corner
the doorman pulls a harlequin nurse romance out of his jacket and sits down to continue reading it
hobbes ties a green surgical mask over his mouth and nose snaps on rubber gloves
he turns to annabelles corpse on the dining room table legs hanging over the edge now naked the private girls school clothes in a heap on the floor
hobbes takes a scalpel from the top of the radiator where he has laid out his surgical instruments
he feels annabelles stomach until he has found what he wants then cuts her open with one smooth confident stroke of the scalpel
he then quickly douses the inside of her abdomen with some clear fluid in a squeeze bottle lights a wooden match and drops it into her abdominal cavity
the corpse bursts into flame
hobbes steps back to watch
tears spring into his eyes
he picks up another scalpel and perfunctorily sticks it into his neck
blood spurts into his mask and soaks through to the other side
hobbes sinks to his knees before the blazing corpse and struggles to draw the scalpel through the tendons of his neck
merrick and the svibens sit across from each other at a long table strewn with floor plans and maps
the river which surrounds the complex can be seen through the glass walls of the office
merrick taps one plan with his finger and slides it over to benda
now you take a look at that one brenda and tell me if it doesnt suit you down to the ground
that one has the big view the panoramic view
in his bathroom nicholas tudor is cleaning his teeth with microscopic attention to detail using an elaborate compressed water device called a water pick
tudor is thirty nine not happy with his work as an insurance appraiser and has recently adopted a general air of terse sullen desperation as his primary mood
his wife janine calls to him from the kitchen where she is just putting the finishing touches on breakfast
breakfast is just about ready nick
tudor pointedly doesnt answer but continues with the water pick until he is completely satisfied
he carefully packs the machine away then leaves the bathroom
in the dining room janine is putting breakfast on the table
tudor sits down without a word and begins to eat
janine returns to the kitchen and comes back with a cup of coffee in each hand
she puts one cup in front of tudor sits down starts to drink the other one
after a pause she speaks
can i call you at the office
what do you want to call me at the office for
i dont know
i just thought i might want to call you
i dont know
i wont be at the office except to sign in
he eats heartily not looking directly at janine ive got a lot of claims to check out
all over the place
garages and more garages
noticing janines silence he finally looks up ill come home right after work
janine continues to toy with the food in her plate
she shrugs once as if to say big deal so what
tudor ignores her and finishes breakfast
tudor leaves his apartment closing the door behind him we see the number clearly
he walks down the hallway on automatic pilot obviously preoccupied turning the corner leading to the elevators without perceiving what he is seeing
at the elevators he hesitates for a moment then presses the up button
when the door opens he steps in
in the elevator are merrick the rental agent and the svibens
were going up
well ill go along for the ride
after a pause to the svibens indicating the elevator wood grain paneling strong silent fireproof fast cushioned ride
everything you could want in an elevator
nobody says another word until the doors spring open and merrick after a wink at tudor hustles the svibens out of the elevator
as the doors close merricks voice floats back to tudor
notice how the entranceways to all the apartments are recessed and individually lit
nope its down that way brenda
recessed and individually lit
once the door has closed tudor presses the button for the top floor
as the elevator ascends he takes out his wallet and removes a key from a zippered compartment
tudor fits the key into the lock of annabelles apartment
he knocks gently and then opens the door
after a pause he steps in and closes the door behind him not wanting to be seen by anyone who might know him
as soon as he is inside the apartment tudor knows that something is seriously wrong
smoke hangs in the air and the smell of burned flesh attacks tudors nostrils
he is on his way to the bedroom when he sees hobbess foot around the corner of the dining room
tudor approaches the dining room with his hand over his nose and mouth
annabelles corpse is still smoking where it lies on the dining room table
hobbess body is twisted into the fetal position at the foot of the table one hand still clutching the scalpel stuck in its neck the floor beneath it bright with
tudor winces as though stuck with a pin
blinking rapidly he edges around the room until his angle of vision is such that he can see the head of the corpse on the table
it is definitely annabelle eyes still staring surgical clip still attached to her lips purple bruises on her neck
tudor turns his body contracting around the pit of his stomach
after a moment he manages to straighten up and stagger from the apartment having at least enough presence of mind to take his attache case which he left by the
door and to close the door behind him
luc tall thin dark not bad looking stands over the table staring at the corpse of annabelle
as he watches two ambulance men throw a sheet over her and begin to lift her down on to a stretcher on the floor
the voice of the superintendent of the building drifts over to him from the other end of the apartment
like i said to the police officer he paid the rent dr
and he came around and chatted a lot with everyone here the staff i mean
not a high and mighty type
but it was her name on the residency list and the buzzer board annabelle
what was it again
she never complained about anything not to me anyway
the super a small unshaven harassed little man with a lot of energy is talking to a large beefy detective who writes everything down in a notebook
pointing to annabelles corpse which is just being carried out the door and that was her
far as i know yeah that was her
the detective now turns to st
luc who is crouched on the floor examining the chalk outline around where hobbess body had lain
is that the man who called you up here
yeah thats dr
hes the head of our little medical clinic here
this is an island you know
takes too long to get into the city
we gotta have everything right here or somebody complains
well lets go talk to your doctor
the detective walks over to st
luc and the super follows
luc rises to meet him
he is wearing very informal summer clothes a bit rumpled
detective sergeant heller
id like to ask you a few questions
obviously a bit dazed by what he has been seeing sure
youre the one who found the bodies
did you touch anything
move anything before we got here
you knew these people
i knew the man emil hobbes a doctor and a professor at university
i saw the girl around the building but i didnt know her
she never came to the clinic
so you just came up to visit this hobbes and you found them like that
i havent seen dr
hobbes since i was in medical school
he taught me
he was my prof in urology and
i think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology
that was it
i had no idea hed ever set foot in starliner towers until today
then what brought you up here
luc begins to pace about as he talks
it was very strange
he called me at six this morning
hobbes called me
i thought i was dreaming
i havent heard that voice for so long
he told me who it was then he said something like meet me at apartment at noon
i want you to go out for lunch with me
its time you furthered your education
then he laughed and hung up
i went back to sleep
he called me again at eight to remind me to come
how did he sound this time
was he nervous
he sounded fine
the telephone rings
the super who has been fiddling with a window with a cracked pane of glass grabs the phone instinctively without looking at the detective who probably would have answered it
no thats not me
you got the wrong guy
just a sec
looks up at st
luc and holds out the phone to him its for you
somebody wants to know how come you didnt show up for lunch
the detective looks suspiciously at st
luc who simply looks dazed
next to a shallow porcelain tray full of immense and grotesque marine worm specimens lies a large parcel wrapped in brown paper
rollos plump fingers eagerly open the package to reveal a large variety of delicatessen sandwiches and accessories
rollo offers some to st
luc while stuffing one in his own mouth
there are cokes and old coffees everywhere plus mustard relish and ketchup dispensers of all kinds
rollo and st
luc sit around rollos desk a very sleek metal affair
rollos lab itself is a combination of modern office and biology room in a museum of natural history
specimens of all kinds in bottles and cases mounted on glass and wood floating in preservative baths are everywhere
there are also a few cages of living insects moldy aquaria and lab cultures in various stages of neglect
there are also clippings from magazines and newspapers sporting furious underlinings and circlings in red ink which are stuck to walls doors bookshelves
despite the potential for chaos however there is an underlying order which reflects rollos own real discipline which is not always immediately apparent
and the microscopes and glass slides the stainless steel gynecological table complete with stirrups metal drug and instrument cabinet etc
are spotless and in good shape
rollo is rotund soft faced and a manic depressive
in his manic phase he is a joker and an elbow nudger and his general style even when discussing medical matters in medical jargon is broad north american jewish
in his depressive phase he becomes a sullen kid who has an oddly sinister aspect to his character
rollo detaches himself from his baby beef in order to comment on the food that not so secretly he loves best of all
not exactly the kind of lunch hobbes would have laid on you rog but its all i got and
places hand on heart leans over confidentially all i got i share with you
take all you want
you touch my spleen rollo
they giggle at an old medical school reference and here all the time i was thinking if i ever bothered to think about the good old days well at least
hes in vd and hes happy
im still a vd man under the skin rog
you know me
im a down to earth kinda guy right
well at least you still talk the same
so who changes
but you gave up your private practice
suddenly youre into pure research and you
youre what a parasitologist
that was my fathers idea
he wanted to set me up i couldnt say no
but hes dead now
and me im still a snoop i gotta do research
look at that beautiful stuff
gestures everywhere lookit it
he jams a final piece of sandwich into his mouth and jumps to his feet smiling broadly
with great enthusiasm indicating the entire lab this is the satyrs tongue
he pulls a book off a shelf with a bookmark in it
he opens the book at the marked page and hands it to st
luc looks at the picture of a satyr with his tongue hanging out and reads the brief note on how medieval alchemists thought the ground up tongue of the satyr
could cure any disease rollo continues to talk
the note includes a warning against swallowing the tongue whole but we dont see the rest of this caution
satyrs tongue was hobbess code name for our project
what we were trying to do was to find an alternative to organ transplants
as rollo speaks he walks all over the place picking up and discarding various charts specimens bottled and diseased human organs etc
as he moves around we catch glimpses of letrasetted signs that rollo has tacked up sex is the invention of a clever venereal disease hobbes dr
hobbess prescription starve a fever feed an obsession the road of excess leads to knowledge plus several pictures of satyrs with their tongues sticking out being cut off by alchemists
youre bored already
transplants are yesterdays kishkas right
shaking his head in protest did i say anything
excited waving specimens of parasites and diseased organs around look
you got men you got parasites that live in on and around men
why not breed a parasite that does something useful
why not breed a parasite capable of taking over the function of any one of a bunch of human organs
why not for example a parasite living in the human abdominal cavity that plugs into the circulatory system and filters the blood like a kidney
if it takes a little blood for itself so what
you can afford it
he is now in full flight
he leans over st
luc and begins to demonstrate what he says by drawing things on st
lucs stomach with his fingers
luc cant hide his amusement
you put the bug into the body of a man with a diseased kidney the bug attacks the bad kidney dissolves it its assimilated by the body and now you
got a perfectly good parasite where you used to have a rotten kidney
i know what youre gonna say
youre gonna say its crazy
laughing its crazy
rollo throws himself back into his chair and grabs a pickle
but heres the beauty part
leans forward for emphasis who cares
i dont get it
you know and i know that hobbes was a lousy teacher eh
dry academic afraid of women lousy
but he was always a genius at one thing getting grants
could he get grants for crazy projects
luc is about to say something but rollo answers his own rhetorical question with a flip of the hand effectively silencing st
you know who pays the rent here
the northern hemisphere organ transplant society
and thats for something thats supposed to put them outta business
and theyre not the only ones
we got grant money coming out of our ears
he leaps up again and pulls a sheaf of reprints from medical journals like the journal of venereal disease etc
he shoves them under st
lucs nose then grabs a jar with a disintegrating octopus like creature in it and a sandwich at the same time
he smacks down the sandwich in front of st
luc by mistake then retrieves it and substitutes the jar with the specimen
luc sifts through the papers and glances at the specimen
luc looks at the papers rollo breathes heavily down his neck and points out things of interest
you take a little of this
thats a very rare venereal disease you get in the nomadic crinua people northeast asia and japan
points to a sexy picture of a japanese lady in heat oo
that ones got it bad
they call it batinh
that means kiss or caress
when you get it it makes your lips itchy ya wanta kiss everything
i even had it once
i always get everything at least once so i know what the patients talking about
he laughs but hes serious and there
you take a little of that
thats beautiful isnt it
thats flexipes the worlds only cephalopod parasite
indicating the jar thats him right there
not a very good specimen
related to squids and octopuses
he lives in the guts of whales and big dolphins
wiggles a finger at the specimen ya like em big n hot n wet dont ya
he walks away from the desk
his manner is now more subdued and reflective
it seems as though everything he says provokes a dozen unspoken thoughts
his depressive phase is beginning
we dont do it all here we send out to have tricky stuff done
the cell fusion enucleation chromosomal fission all that fancy close work
rollo sighs heavily
luc gently shoves all the papers aside
rollo how come hobbes killed himself
rollo toys with the gynecological examination table sliding the stirrups in and out on their adjustment bars
shrugging funny in the head
high suicide rate in the medical profession
too much body alla time bodies bodies
he now gets close to st
luc putting an arm around his shoulder
rog i gotta talk serious to you
i want you to come into this with me
to tell the honest to god truth im lonely
begins to pace around again all hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night
he wanted you in anyway
thats why we were gonna get together the three of us
we would have enough to keep us going for at least five years even with inflation
a bit uncomfortable being put on the spot rollo you know me
once a gp always a gp
almost angrily you want to help sick people for the rest of your life
god forbid i should talk you out of it
you oughta be careful yourself
might end up cutting your throat
it was women did it to hobbes
couldnt handle them
that girl that annabelle talk about crazy projects
who was she
reluctant to talk aw he met her when he was lecturing at some private girls school
they caught him examining her little tits for breast cancer in the faculty lounge
she was twelve
it was craziness believe me
indicating the gynecological table they used to come here sometimes
shakes his head dont ask
he starts to run down like a spring wound toy at the end of its run
he glances at a picture of annabelle stuck in a corner which st
luc just notices for the first time
ill never really understand how he could do what he did to her
luc looks at his watch and gets up out of his chair for the first time
well rollo linsky
i gotta go open up the store
its been great to see you again
he moves toward the door
rollo trails after him head down obviously dejected
they shake hands
luc has to open the door himself rollo is really preoccupied
finally he looks st
luc in the eye
but youll think about what i said about working together huh
ill think about it
rollo manages a smile
luc leaves closing the door behind him
in his bathroom nick tudor cleans his teeth with the water pick as usual
the sounds of janine bustling about with breakfast filter into the bathroom
tudor hums tunelessly
suddenly he doubles over in a soundless spasm of pain
the water pick writhes in the sink shooting water on to the mirror and over the floor
after a moment he straightens up and begins to press around the area of his navel obviously looking for lumps which it seems from his expression he has already found
and is overly familiar with
the water pick continues to rattle around in the sink
janine pokes her head around the corner to investigate
tudor tries to cover up grabs the water pick and begins to work on his teeth again hiding the occasional twinge that hits him
you say something
damned thing wriggled out of my hands
janine waits for tudor to say something else
he ignores her
after a pause you sure youre ok nick
tudor continues to ignore her
janine sighs in a very obvious way and disappears
tudor waits for a second turns off the water pick then checks out his stomach again
janine sits in the middle of a bench towel around her head and middle
next to her sits betts who is in her early forties attractive in a tough kind of way and wears her hair short for efficiencys sake
in her relationship with janine she plays the role of tough worldly older sister
she has the poise and confidence of a woman who has created her own success and position in life a marked contrast to the neurotic vivacity of janine who is
ten years her junior and has never known independence
they are both watched by the only other occupant of the sauna benda sviben now a full fledged resident of starliner towers
she is huddled in a corner very shy and looking particularly thin mousy and ineffectual in the presence of the other two full bodied women
betts is in the middle of giving janine advice about tudors disease
probably nothing at all
its probably just a bunch of i dont know fatty cysts
you can have them removed in a doctors office
has nick seen a doctor
he hates doctors
doctors and lawyers
he never goes to doctors
you go on down to the clinic and tell that nice dr
pauses to work it out you tell him that nicks ill hes got these lumps and he cant get out of bed
tell him to come when youre sure nickll be home
and dont tell nick anything
let the two of them fight it out
not displeased with the idea hell be really mad
with a conspiratorial smile so
youll find out whats wrong and then youll be able to relax a little bit
let him be the uptight one for a change
she stretches out full length on the bench her toes bumping bendas thigh
betts notices benda for the first time
to benda oops sorry
havent seen you here before have i
benda draws her towel around her wide eyed completely intimidated by betts
she manages a nervous smile
tudors secretary a lumpy and motherly lady named mrs
wheatley she has a nameplate on her desk is shuffling some papers when the telephone rings
her small cubicle of an office is appended to tudors only slightly larger office in a huge downtown office building
the door leading to tudors office is closed
ashen gaunt insurance appraisals
one moment please
ill buzz him
she places the caller on hold and presses the inter office buzzer
she directs her attention for a moment to the papers on her desk
when after a pause she notices that tudor hasnt answered the phone she releases the caller from hold and picks up the receiver
im sorry to keep you waiting
ill put you on hold again and see if i can find mr
wheatley pushes the hold button and gets out of her chair
she knocks gently on the door
theres a call for you
perplexed by tudors failure to respond mrs
wheatley gingerly opens the door
its that man whose lamborghini caught fire on st
catherine street and burned to the ground
hes very angry
she catches a glimpse of tudor rolling around on the floor behind his desk his swivel chair tipped over on to its side
she rushes over to tudor and helps him to his feet
tudor is breathing heavily and has to support himself by leaning on the desk while mrs
wheatley straightens up the chair for him
tudor collapses into the chair mumbling and rolling his head from side to side
wheatley pulls a kleenex from her sleeve and dabs away a small trickle of blood coming from one corner of tudors mouth
were going to get you to a hospital
thats what were going to do
beginning to come around no no
ill be all right
im all right
wheatley shows tudor the spot of blood on her kleenex
do you see this
this is blood
it came from your insides
that means its serious
probably an ulcer
you executives are all the same
tudor shoves her hand away and sits straight at his desk still pretty wobbly
smoothing the hair back from tudors forehead in a very motherly fashion now nicholas it doesnt cost anything to be sure everythings all right
i think you should definitely go to the emergency ward and
abruptly swiveling away from mrs
wheatleys hand call me a cab will you please mona
im going home for the day
nicholas i think
i dont care what you think
please call me a cab
wheatley steps away from the desk obviously hurt by tudors brusqueness
mollifyingly all right nicholas
she leaves closing the door behind her
tudor sighs taking a deep breath
he is suddenly hit by another twinge of pain
he clutches his stomach
blood trickles out of the corner of his mouth
after a pause he licks the blood off his lips with the tip of his tongue
the starliner towers medical clinic is small but complete
luc and his nurse forsythe are backed up by a secretary receptionist who sits behind a desk surrounded by filing cabinets at the end of the hallway which serves as
there are chairs lined up against one wall flanked by coffee tables piled high with the traditional two year old magazines
three or four people sit waiting to see st
luc among them the aging but sprightly mr
parkins and janine tudor
parkins who considers himself something of a ladies man is talking to janine when st
luc appears and looks at the list of patients who have signed in
and this kriedler seems to think that mega vitamin therapy may be the answer to the question of aging
thats not to suggest that the aging process is in any way reversible i dont think for a minute that it is but it may be stoppable and thats where
mega vitamins come in
luc gestures to janine to follow him into his office
janine gets up excusing herself to mr
excuse me brad
she follows st
luc into his office
he closes the door behind her
the cab carrying tudor pulls up at the main doors of the towers
tudor still a bit unsteady signs a chit for the driver and gets out of the car
the doorman opens both doors for tudor as he enters the building
janine sits opposite st
luc who has a file open before him on his desk
well theres certainly nothing here in this check up i did for your husbands company last year
blood pressure a touch high cholesterol count nice and low
looking janine in the eye i just cant see cancer developing that fast janine not the way youve described it
could be swollen glands or something i dont know
a bit relieved but still tense youll come up and take a look at him
standing up if he cant make it down here
thats what im here for
but it wont be until oh
checking his watch
not too late
janine smiles and shakes her head
just gotta have time to put the clinic to bed for the night and grab some supper
thats great doctor
janine gets up opens the door to the reception area and leaves closing the door behind her
luc keeps staring at tudors file shifts something from one side of the folder to the other
something bothers him
the door to one of the examination rooms opens and forsythe pops her head around the corner
ementhals ready and waiting doctor
be with you in a sec
luc studies tudors file
tudor enters his apartment and throws his jacket and attache case on to a chair
he loosens his tie and makes himself a drink then sits down on the sofa and switches on the tv set
after only a short moment of relative calm tudor suddenly contracts into the fetal position spilling his drink on to the floor
he rolls on to the floor eyes staring out of his head mouth opening and closing like that of a fish out of water tendons in his neck bulging with
he soon manages to struggle to his feet the primary spasm of pain apparently over
he keeps both hands clamped over his mouth as though in a vain attempt to forestall a bout of vomiting and stumbles into the bathroom
once in the bathroom tudor throws himself over the side of the bathtub knees on the bath mat head well down into the tub itself
he gags and vomits into the tub and collapses exhausted on the floor mouth bloody
in the tub a trail of blood streaked slime leads into the drain
forsythe comes out to the reception area from an examination room checks out the patient list and beckons to mr
im ready for you now brad
parkins gets up and follows forsythe into one of the examination rooms
once inside the examination room forsythe closes the door and hands parkins a hospital tunic
now you just take off all your clothes put this on and hop up on to the table over there ok
doctorll be in to see you in a few minutes
as forsythe begins to leave you dont have to go
im not shy
dont be a tease brad
im still working you know
parkins chuckles to himself still life in the old boy yet kind of feeling and begins to undress
tudor staggers into the living room from the bathroom wiping his mouth with a facecloth
he sits down on a chair facing the sliding glass door which leads to the apartments balcony
he breathes heavily gasping for air
his expression is a dazed one and he mumbles incoherently
after a moments rest he rises opens the glass door and steps out on to the balcony
tudor hangs on to the railing of the narrow concrete balcony gulping down the air scanning the lights of the tower opposite
suddenly the muscles of his neck go tense again his mouth seems to gape open at the extreme limits imposed by muscle and jawbone his hands fly up to his
mouth in an attempt to keep down whatever is about to come up
hanging over the railing of the balcony like an ocean traveler in a rough sea tudor finally gives up the struggle and hangs on for dear life as he retches
gags moans and finally vomits
two elderly women vi and olive are taking a leisurely evening stroll at the base of tudors tower
they both hold small transparent umbrellas over their heads and walk gingerly along the path bordering the lawn
suddenly the liquid fleshy thwack of the parasite vomited by tudor from high above hitting one of the umbrellas is heard
a large splotch of blood spatters the first ladys umbrella just off center as though it has been hit by a heavy blood soaked sponge
the force of the blow almost twists the umbrella from the first ladys frail hand and she gives a little cry of surprise
her companion extends a hand to help the first lady keep her balance then gives a slightly more startled cry when she sees the blood
the first lady examines her umbrella as well but does not react with such surprise
examining the bloodied umbrella aw
theyre always crashing into tall buildings
its such a shame such a shame
the windows fool them you know
the creature the second parasite to emerge from tudors body lies in the grass away from the bright cones of light thrown by the towers lawn lamps
we can barely make out its bloody twitching form
beyond the parasite is a basement window through which is visible a large laundry room complete with washers and dryers
the window has been propped open a couple of inches by a bar of laundry soap
the first lady makes a move to find the injured creature but her companion tightens her grip on the old ladys arm
come along olive
maybe the poor things just been hurt
maybe we should look for him
pulling olive along dont be silly dear
its in heaven now whatever it is
wont help at all for you to get into a fuss and muddle over it
now come along and lets finish up our little evening stroll and get you tucked up in bed in front of the color tv
the two women walk off down the path vis voice fading away in the shadows
you know what a restless night you have if you dont get your two hours of color tv dear so lets bustle along and get our walk over with shall
luc is examining mr
parkins sits on the examination table with the hospital tunic on
luc presses gently around parkins abdomen in the area of the navel
better take it easy
theres a lot of pressure in there
luc stops pressing and takes up his stethoscope
he begins to percuss the old mans abdomen
want me to breathe deeply
just breathe normally
luc finishes percussing removes the stethoscope from his ears and stands back thoughtfully
confidentially good shape for an old man eh
after a pause mr
parkins what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady
she had a couple just like them
right here near her belly button
you could push em around
i thought they were kinda sexy myself
didnt she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor
shrugs didnt seem worried about them
was this girl from starliner towers
she lived in
but we usually went to my place
bigger liquor cabinet bigger bed
chuckles then gets serious she was gone when i got back from my last florida trip
had a beautiful tan
smiles again must have gone home to mother
was her name annabelle horsefield
thats the one
luc sits down at the counter beneath the medicine cabinet and begins to write in parkins file
ok you can get dressed now mr
the old man begins to put his shirt and tie back on
handing parkins a slip of paper im going to send you to the hospital to have a few x rays taken
i want to find out exactly what youre hiding in there ok
give them this
the address is right there under radiology
gonna cut me open
well lets wait for the x rays
used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did
chuckles cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants gotta admit that
luc smiles politely his mind obviously elsewhere
a bar of laundry soap props open the window of the laundry room
the presence of the wounded parasite is indicated only by the glistening slime trail which streaks the section of wall immediately below the window
the hand of an old woman puckered and wrinkled from many hours submerged in hot soapy water reaches up and yanks the bar of soap out of the jaws of
the window swing shut
the womans hand slides the bolt home locking the window from the inside
the old woman is short dumpy puffy faced in her late sixties
her hair is carelessly tied in a bun on top of her head
she sniffles shakes her head turns away from the window and walks across the room to the long bank of washers and dryers
as she walks she has to thread her way among the dozen or so shopping bags full of dirty laundry against apartment regulations she takes in outsiders laundry which she
has brought down the elevator with her
she flips open the top of the first washer and begins to dig clothes out of the nearest shopping bag
from above and behind the washer we watch her fill the machine and reach into the front of her dress which is black and frayed
after feeling around for a few seconds she pulls out a plastic bag filled with white granulated detergent
she dumps some of this into the washer finds the appropriate coins in the pocket of her dress and starts the machine
she watches it for a second to make sure its working properly then puts the plastic bag back where she found it
she picks up the bag she has almost emptied and shuffles in her ragged slippers to the next washer
she stops in front of it and puts down the bag
the old woman notices a slimy streak near the open hole of the washer
she grimaces grabs a sock from the bag and cleans off the top of the washer with it
she tosses the sock into the washer and leans over the hole trying to see inside
the parasite which has been lurking in the washer suddenly springs from the opening on to the old womans face suckering on to her flesh with its stubby tentacles
she shrieks and grabs at the creature with both hands trying to pull it off
she stumbles back from the washer and begins to trip over various shopping bags
finally she goes down amidst her laundry thrashing and spilling clothes out everywhere
in the grocery store built into the base of one of the towers janine flips through some magazines finally buying a vogue
she stops to look at several shelves of various kinds of food picking up this and that but somehow the thought of cooking or even eating repulses her and she
leaves without buying anything but the magazine
janine walks along a hallway stops at a door knocks gently and then opens the door and walks in obviously very familiar with the occupant
janine enters betts apartment
betts is sitting cross legged in leotards on the broadloom a number of very large black and white photographs spread out in front of her
as she speaks to janine she arranges and rearranges them
other equipment and graphics of various kinds stuck on walls hidden in corners and lying on chairs and tables suggest that betts is in advertising and commercial graphics
janine stands halfway in the door
want a drink
just wanted to tell you that dr
luc is coming up to see nick at ten or so
was he nice to you
takes a sip from a glass on the floor next to her ive ordered in some vrai cuisine francaise from jean phillipe at the cote dazur restaurant
escargots in garlic butter
they have lovely strong delivery boys who fight their way through sleet and hail and the gloom of night just to bring me my coq au vin
and after dr
luc has told you that theres nothing wrong with nick that a vacation wont cure and if nick falls asleep early again you just come on back here for company
and a late supper
you hear me
now i mean it
i always order enough for two and ill just get fat and lonely if you dont show up
janine wiggles her fingers goodbye and leaves
janine walks down the hallway to her apartment her vogue rolled up under her arm
she opens the door to her apartment its not locked and goes in
a moment after shes gone and closed the door two children about ten years old appear around a corner giggling and jostling each other
they approach tudors apartment
cmon lets smoke one of the cigarettes right now
your fatherll never miss it
i cant dummy
hell see that the packs been opened
youre such a dumbhead
im gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke em all myself
buy em with what dumbhead
flipping open a milk box with some milk jugs i just happened to pick up on the way home
the first box she tries is empty
she advances to the next and the next finally finding one that has a jug in it
she takes it and advances to tudors box jug swinging companion trailing after her in admiration
she stops at tudors milk box and flicks the door open
she looks inside just about to reach for the jug that nestles back in the shadows
the boy takes a look
inside the box a third parasite can just be seen clinging to a three quart white plastic milk jug
the jug is smeared with blood
the boxs inside door is ajar
the tv set can be heard from inside the apartment
guess the milk went bad
shrugs its still worth money
the girl hesitates for a second
suddenly the parasite twitches around to the front of the jug
the girl startled slams the box door shut
lets get outta here before somebody hears us
the children run off down the hallway together
after a few seconds the box door is nudged open again from the inside
janine sits down in front of the tv set
after a moment or two she gets up turns the set off and flops back down on the sofa with her vogue
she doesnt notice a trail of bloody slime leading from the bedroom to the inside door of the milk box
in the bedroom a hand reaches down and pulls back a bedsheet to reveal a naked abdomen
it is tudors abdomen and he reaches out with trembling fingers to touch a lump the size of a chicken egg stretching the skin to one side of his navel
tudor watches the lump in the muted light of his bedroom
he gradually extends his hand toward the lump which disappears the instant its touched
delirious voice strained whispering come here boy
here boy here
he taps and scratches the skin near his navel as though trying to lure a cat into attacking his fingers
he is propped up in bed sweating profusely half dressed
he looks weak and drained but still manages to smile with maniacal intensity his eyes wide and bright
come on fella
you and me were gonna be friends arent we
we can now see that the sheets are twisted the pillows half off the bed
tudor begins drumming on his abdomen
gradually cautiously the lump under tudors skin returns
he tries to seize the lump with his fingers and it shrinks back almost disappearing into his abdominal cavity again
tudor seems disappointed
no no no
dont run away boy
im not going to hurt you
not going to hurt you
were going to be friends
the lump returns again
gently tudor begins stroking it
the lump seems to respond by pulsing slightly the rhythm strangely masturbatory
closing his eyes in bliss and smiling again attaboy
in the living room janine suddenly realizes that if the tv set was on nick must be home
she gets to her feet and walks to the bedroom
inside the bedroom we see the door open
light floods the room as janine enters
janine sees tudor sprawled out on the bed
i didnt know you were home
what are you doing
youre almost falling out of bed
how are you feeling
tudor twists around to see who has spoken eyes wide but now unsmiling
with the same motion he pulls the covers over his abdomen to hide the lumps from janine
janine stands at the bedroom door for an instant then approaches the bedside
she moves as though her hands were tied at her sides as though she is quite consciously holding herself together
tenderly but with caution as though expecting a blow nick does your stomach hurt
can i see those bumps on your tummy can she reaches out to pull back the covers again but he rolls away from her
leave me alone
janine straightens up
her hands come up to her face and tears well up in her eyes
frustrated oh why wont you let me help you
she turns and walks angrily out of the room slamming the door behind her
tudor rolls over slowly on to his back eyes wide and shining smiling again
murmuring attaboy attaboy
luc is examining a very pretty young girl who sits on the examination table in a hospital tunic
everything else seems to be fine
now if it gives you any trouble at all any sharp pain any unusual discharge you come and see me right away
they can be tricky sometimes
ok you can get dressed
were all through
the girl starts to get dressed
luc scribbles something in her file and then takes it with him into the adjoining office closing the door behind him
luc sits at his desk and opens parkins file
forsythe about twenty three earthy and humorous comes in with an armful of papers and records which she throws in groups on to st
distributing papers ok roger
heres the stuff you wanted
files on horsefield tudor swinburne and velakofsky
papers published by hobbes linsky and lefebvre in a couple of issues of the bulletin of the canadian medical association and also the journal of the american medical association
and as an added extra a couple of odds and ends from the files i helped compile before your time here doctor
i thought they might interest you
thats great forsythe great
do i get a kiss
luc is absorbed in his papers and doesnt respond
forsythe prods his shoulder
he looks up at her
they kiss st
luc making sure that it doesnt get too heavy
are there any more on the list
dottys the last
the telephone rings
luc picks it up
that you rog
not recognizing the voice yes
its me rollo linsky
i was just thinking about you
realizing that the conversation is likely to be a long one forsythe gets off the desk and walks over to a metal locker in the corner which she opens
inside are her street clothes
she begins to take off her nurses uniform in full view of st
luc not being obvious about the distraction shes providing but not taking pains to hurry dressing or be modest either
in the scene that follows we cut among three basic things rollo in his lab talking and eating st
luc in his office watching forsythe get undressed and then dressed and hobbess notes and scribblings which do not necessarily have to be on the screen long enough to be
hobbess notes are there more to convince the viewer that they exist and to provide flavor than to transfer information
been glancing at some of your publications on your work with hobbes
in his lab rollo sits at the gynecological table abandoned by hobbes
rollo is using it as an auxiliary desk
on the table are several opened waxed paper packages of beef knishes and accessories
there are also several old cardboard shoeboxes some still tied with string some opened and overflowing with papers of all kinds hobbess private notes
eating a knish yeah well im flattered but you wont find any real meat in them
shuffling papers listen rog
i knew hobbes was funny you know
i told you that
but i didnt really know just how funny he was
when he kicked off they sent all the personal secret stuff they found to his mother shes still alive but just barely and she sent everything she thought was medical
to me here at the lab
im hobbess partner right
laughs sardonically anyway ive been going through his papers and what they add up to is this hobbes was shafting us all me the university the foundations and the councils
the private labs everybody
we never really knew what it was we were working on
hobbes gave us each a few crumbs but he was the only one who knew what the whole loaf would look like
luc watches as forsythe rolls her stockings down
he shuffles through hobbess publications
ok i bite
what does it look like
it looks like and i quote a disease to save man from his mind
i dont get it
lemme clarify for you
rollo pauses to wash down some knish with a can of coca cola
forsythe catches st
luc watching her dress and smiles
luc swivels back to his files
rollo searches through hobbess notes to find the relevant quotes
as he does so he drops a few crumbs of knish on the page and his plump fingers brush the crumbs away smearing some meat over the words
hobbes thought that man is an animal that thinks too much an animal that has lost touch with his instinct his primal self
in other words too much brain and not enough guts
and what he came up with to help our guts along was a human parasite that is
lemme find it here
a combination of aphrodisiac and venereal disease a modern version of the satyrs tongue
rollo pauses and flips to a new note with the heading annabelle underlined in red she is becoming a new creature before my eyes
it is like living at the dawn of creation
i am euphoric i am in ecstasy
but the important thing for you is this hobbes used annabelle as a guinea pig
he implanted her with the thing
i figure that once the parasites took annabelle went berserk
i dunno what she did but hobbes wasnt ready for it
he had to kill her
and he wasnt trying to burn her he was burning them all of them
luc watches forsythe who is halfway through getting her street clothes on
he toys with the velakofsky file which contains abdominal x rays showing dark blurred masses inside the abdominal cavity
he didnt make it
maybe hobbes didnt know it but annabelle was a pretty popular girl around starliner towers
ive got three men here maybe four whore hosting large free moving apparently pathogenic abdominal growths that nobody ive tried can identify
you were next on my list
id kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys
ive got a date with one of them at ten
can you make it
pause ah i dont want to panic you or anything but i mean the way hobbes designed them theyre supposed to get out of hand real quick so you dont
have much time to think about whats happening to you
once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream
but if you see some people doing kind of compulsive maybe even bizarre sexual things
laughing he doesnt take this aspect too seriously yeah
what do i do then
once you can get at them theres a lotta stuff you can use
ill bring a bagful
its just the standard tropical kit
but the trick is to get at them
forsythe has finished dressing and is waiting for st
luc to get off the phone
its apartment south tower starliner towers
may as well go there directly
see you at ten
luc hangs up
if youre going to be staying here anyway why dont you come up to my place for a late supper
meeting rollo at tudors
might take a while
innocently doesnt matter to me how late it is
i can keep it warm
luc pushes his papers aside for a moment and stretches in his swivel chair
i dont think so
supper at my place
happy because she knows she can get him to stay overnight great
go back to your files
she leaves closing the door behind her
luc swivels thoughtfully in his chair for a second or two then turns back to his files
forsythe walks through the darkened and deserted reception area to the elevators
through the main doors we see a delivery van parked in the main driveway
a young man aged about twenty five kurt the delivery boy dark intense bearded his manner as stiff and formal as the tuxedo that he wears rolls a restaurant serving
cart toward the main doors
he has obviously just come from the van outside which is emblazoned with the words restaurant cote dazur
the doorman smiles and opens the door for kurt obviously familiar with the restaurant
kurt takes great care as he lifts the cart slightly so that it clears the doormats
on the carts two levels is an elaborate array of silver serving vessels and utensils
elevator doors slide open and kurt steps out pushing his cart
he walks down the hallway looking for bettss apartment
after he has passed a few doors he approaches one which is slightly ajar
as kurt approaches the door opens wider to reveal the old woman from the laundry room
she is no longer wearing her dumpy laundry clothes however but is dressed in a translucent nightgown and wears a grotesque amount of make up
she is careful to keep half her face hidden behind the door
kurt notices her but chooses to ignore her
he is just approaching her when she calls to him
kurt keeps on moving
he is now just passing her door
the old woman edges out from behind the door a bit more
kurt cant resist turning to look at her although he keeps moving
when he looks her in the eye she eases out slightly from behind the door to reveal that half her face has been horribly burned by the laundry room parasite
the eye melted shut the nostril drooping
kurt is so stunned that he slows
the old woman speaks softly
hungry for love
hungry for love
she suddenly reaches out and grabs kurt by his tux with both hands and with tremendous energy jerks him back into her apartment and slams the door closed with a
kurts cart remains out in the hallway the food steaming
in her dining room betts mixes herself a drink and checks her watch
she takes a sip then goes into the bathroom and bends over the bathtub having balanced her drink on the edge of the tub
from inside the drain of the tub we see betts place the plug in the plughole
betts turns on the water adjusting the proportion of hot to cold until she gets it exactly the way she wants it then gets undressed
she wraps a thick and colorful towel around her and goes out to the living room with her drink in hand
in the living room she arranges her photos in a new order props them up against the sofa changes them around again
back in the bathroom betts checks the temperature of the water by swishing her hand around in it
the water drums heavily on the floor of the tub
betts puts her drink on the edge of the tub and turns the water off
she now drops her towel on to the bathmat and steps into the tub
she reaches over the edge of the tub to straighten her sandals on the bathmat then picks up her drink and stretches back
she takes a big slug of her drink
her toes curl in pleasure
the drain plug begins to jerk and twitch as though something were trying to push it out from inside the drain
betts sinks down in the water until her hair short as it is begins to float a bit
the drain plug begins to jerk more and more violently until it is pushed right out of its plug hole
the water begins to run out of the drain but only in a slight trickle the drain pipe is blocked by a soft spongy body
betts rolls her head back and forth across the back of the tub smiling relaxed enjoying the sensation
one of the parasites stubby tentacles slowly appears probing out of the drain hole
then another appears then another
betts puts down her drink on the tubs edge and reaches for the soap and washcloth
her eyes are half closed and a smile still flickers about her lips
the sound of water suddenly rushing out of the drain in volume rouses betts out of her reverie
she sits up and looks down toward the plug end of the tub
the parasite is crawling toward her up the middle of the tub almost touching her legs which are pressed together against one side of the tub
the water is becoming pink with the blood that diffuses through it
betts mouth opens slowly and her eyes are wide
her reactions are obviously being confused by the drinks she has recently had
under the water now very shallow the parasites tentacles touch bettss thighs
betts tries to scream but cant
the parasite suckers its way between betts thighs
she screams a silent scream in the tub her mouth wide open her head rolling from side to side
the only sounds are the thrashing of her legs in the water and the gurgle of the drain
with a spasm that shakes her whole body betts throws her arms wide and knocks her glass off the edge of the tub and on to the tiles of the
the glass shatters
after a moment or two of further silent struggle betts arches her back then falls into a semi conscious stupor slumping motionless in the tub
nicholas tudor lies flat on his back in bed on top of the covers
the physical state of his face ghastly and cadaverous is in sharp contrast to his expression which is ecstatic beatific madonna like
tudors hands rest on his abdomen in a posture often associated with pregnant women
between his hands in the area around the navel three lumps shift beneath the skin changing positions and pulsing rhythmically
as they move tudor makes little delirious crooning sounds a parody of a lullaby
in the living room janine sits on the couch agitatedly flipping through her vogue now wearing large fashionable glasses with thick tinted prescription lenses
she cant seem to get into doing anything until st
she gets up and turns the tv on again deliberately turning up the volume to an uncomfortable level
an old man and his wife the spergazzis are taking their late night constitutional through the halls of the south tower
their arms are linked and they both walk with the aid of canes the ultra modern aluminum kind with four rubber tipped prongs at the end
lovely lovely evening
very quiet eh
spergazzi nods and smiles patting mr
they round a corner which leads them down the stretch of hall which passes by tudors door
as they approach tudors door they notice a plastic milk jug lying in the hall just below the open milk chute door
spergazzi detaches herself from her husband and bends down with difficulty to pick up the jug
eh the children in this apartment theyre such little thieves
you have to put a lock on everything
she puts the jug back in the milk chute
she notices the blood smeared on it just a second before the parasite in the chute fastens itself to her wrist with its suckers
she stares at her wrist in astonishment
she is wearing the parasite like some monstrous spongy oozing wristwatch
she tries to shake the thing off
it cant be dislodged
she turns in disbelief to her husband and then screams at the top of her lungs
spergazzi lifts his cane and tries to strike the thing with the canes prongs
the force of his blow throws him off balance and he falls dragging his wife down with him
spergazzi moans in pain and terror
her husband manages to get to his knees and begins to smash at the thing with his cane
white burning fluid begins to squirt everywhere
mrs spergazzis forearm begins to smoke bubble and dissolve
she becomes hysterical
spergazzi continues to smash away at the thing now with some success
in the kitchen a thick paperbound book called guide to gourmet cooking lies open and face down on the kitchen counter next to the sink
there are a couple of pots and pans heating on the stove
forsythe picks up the book then opens one of the pots to check something
she is obviously taking a lot of care with st
lucs late supper
she puts the lid back on the pot reads a bit more then checks the time on an electric clock on the counter
she opens the oven door then takes a bone handled carving fork from a carving set and begins to prod at a roast in a ceramic roasting dish
someone knocks on the door
forsythe leaves her oven and goes to answer it carving fork in hand
she opens the door
kresimir sviben stands in the hallway eyes wide insane smile on his face
he looks at forsythe as though she were a piece of steak
kresimir doesnt answer
he begins to drool his mouth working as though in anticipation of a meal
forsythe gets a little nervous
can i help you
he is visibly shaking
speaking with difficulty yes
without warning he lunges for forsythe who vainly tries to slam the door in his face
kresimir pushes his way past the door and grabs forsythe by the back of the head trying to kiss her and drooling
forsythe breaks away and runs toward the bathroom intending to lock herself in
kresimir throws himself at her legs managing to grab one of her feet
she doesnt fall but holds on to a cabinet and tries to pull free
kresimir begins to climb up her body
forsythe terrified and gasping for breath plunges the long curved prongs of the carving fork into kresimirs shoulder
he screams with pain and loosens his grip on forsythe long enough for her to pull away leaving her apron and part of her dress in kresimirs hands
she runs for the door and is gone
kresimir still on his knees holds the apron and the piece of dress to his face breathing in forsythes fragrance
he begins to shuffle toward the door on his knees kissing the clothes in his hands mumbling and moaning
oh my darling i worship i worship at the shrine of your body your body your body oh your body
betts lies slumped in her bathtub her hair matted and damp her eyes open and staring
her mouth begins to work in a very sensual way and she begins to drool slightly
the tub is completely empty now except for the scum of blood and soap
the smashed glass is scattered all over the floor near the base of the tub
zombie like betts rises from the tub and steps out on to the floor her feet missing the bathmat
the crunch and snap of her bare feet on the broken glass are heightened abnormally by the tiled echo chamber of the bathroom
the steps betts takes toward the medicine cabinet leave bloody prints on the floor
betts takes out various bottles and plastic cases and tubes from the medicine cabinet and begins to apply make up to her face with mechanical precision
luc is reading a section of one of hobbess medical papers in preparation for examining tudor later on
the section we see says
thus the theoretical organism we are now considering would exhibit what i choose to call compressed evolution
this in effect means that each generation of the said organism would be better adapted to inhabit and to control the behavior of its host
suddenly forsythe bursts in out of breath semi hysterical tearful
luc rises from his chair and forsythe throws herself on him sobbing
i think i recognized him
a man who lives here
breaking down he just attacked me for no reason at all
i just opened the door
i was making supper for you and he grabbed me he tried to kiss me
luc hugs forsythe for a moment then holds her away from him so that he can get some information out of her
where is he now
do you know
i think i
i think i killed him
i stabbed him with something and he fell
will you be ok now
ive got to go to your place to see if hes still there
ive got to see if its
if its what we both think it is
youre not leaving me here all alone
im going with you
luc hesitates for a second then grabs his black leather doctors bag
inside a descending elevator a middle aged woman and her teen aged daughter flip through a magazine together
the elevator sinks toward the ground floor of the south tower then slows and stops
they both look up at the floor numbers
its not their floor
the doors slide open
nobody seems to be waiting
the mother pushes the close door button a bit impatiently
a hand holding a crepe oozing red jam and sugar reaches around into the elevator
the two women cringe suddenly afraid
kurt the delivery boy steps around and into the elevator smiling broadly eyes wide and glistening
he drools slightly
the doors slide closed
kurt offers one crepe to each woman
the doorman sits beside the intercom board reading another harlequin nurse romance when he happens to glance up and notice the elevator flashers which indicate a stuck elevator
he sighs shakes his head always something going wrong stuffs the pocketbook into his jacket and gets up taking out a huge ring of keys from his pocket as he
he walks over to the metal control panel sunk into the wall between the elevators and opens it with one of the keys on the ring
then checking to make sure which elevator is the stuck one he plays with a switch which manually overrides the floor selector and brings the elevator down
the doorman watches as the numbers show that the elevator is finally coming down
he stands by waiting to see who or what has caused the elevator to stay at one floor for so long jingling his keys trying to look stern and authoritarian
the doors spring open
kurt stands at the back of the elevator one arm around the young girl who hugs him tightly
the girl is finishing the last bit of one of the crepes sucking her fingers deliciously
the mother sits slumped in the opposite corner her coat open her dress torn bruises on her face
she struggles to her feet
kurt and the girl are ignoring her
the doorman is nonplussed
he hesitates then makes a move toward the elevator intending to help the woman to her feet
what is this all about
whats the matter with you
what are you doing in there
the woman suddenly lunges at the doorman and tries to pull him down
kurt detaches himself from the girl and joins her
they giggle and drool all over the doorman as they pull him down and pin him to the floor
the daughter still licking her fingers slowly approaches the doorman
hey thats enough enough of this nonsense
what is this
the daughter kneels at the doormans feet then crawls over him her mouth working drooling
she lowers her lips over his kurt making it impossible for the doorman to move his head out of the way
forsythe and st
luc are hurrying to forsythes apartment to see if kresimir is still there
as they round a corner they see the spergazzis coming toward them the old lady hobbling and hysterical the old man helping her walk as best he can trying to
maintain some kind of calm
when spergazzi sees st
luc he lifts his four pronged cane and waves it around to get attention
hey doctor doctor

spergazzi shows st
luc his wifes forearm which has been badly burned by the parasites animal tissue solvent

spergazzi starts to wail in italian
spergazzi tries to soothe her as st
luc examines her carefully

walking away down to the incinerator
janine dozes fitfully on the couch her glasses fallen on to the carpet her vogue crumpled underneath her
tudors voice calls to her from the bedroom
it has an eerie wailing tone to it
come into the bedroom janine
tudor keeps calling until janine wakes up with a start and jumps to her feet still half asleep
she rubs her eyes and walks to the bedroom
janine opens the bedroom door
from her point of view we see a dark blurry figure sitting on the edge of the bed
are you up
i cant see a thing i took my contacts out
tudor speaks from the bed without moving
i feel wonderful
come and sit beside me beside me on the bed
janine hesitates for a second then walks to the bed and sits down
she can now see that tudor although pale and sickly is smiling ecstatically
he puts an arm around janine who reacts stiffly
do you want to make love
youre absolutely beautiful those eyes that expression
youre absolutely the most sexy thing alive
do you want to make love
slightly repulsed nick youre so strange
tudor begins to unbutton his shirt with one hand his other still gripping janine tightly
you will make love to me wont you janine
wont you make love to me

i think ive forgotten how to start
now in tears oh nick nick
i cant take this

janine hesitantly helps tudor remove his shirt and begins to caress him in a perfunctory way tears in her eyes
her caresses make tudor moan with pleasure
oh janine youre so beautiful
youre my wife
youre my wife
janines hand sweeps across tudors abdomen
she pulls her hand away startled obviously having just felt a few of tudors lumps
she looks up at tudors face with a mixture of horror and wonder in her eyes
tudor is confused he doesnt want the caresses to stop
pleading youre my wife janine
please make love to me
the spergazzi apartment is very heavily decorated in the mediterranean european catholic style featuring lots of plastic and plaster madonnas calendars with christ exposing his bleeding heart etc
spergazzi lies on an overstuffed couch with her wrist held up for forsythe to bandage after she coats it with a healing gel
spergazzi wears a suffering martyr expression
spergazzi leans over the back of the couch patting his wifes other hand solicitously
the steel door at the top of a concrete flight of stairs swings open and st
he quickly negotiates the steps and opens the steel door at the bottom which leads to the incinerator room
once inside st
luc grabs the poker hanging from an iron hook sunk into the wall of the incinerator slides open the bolt on the door and opens it
he begins to probe around inside the incinerator oven but cant really see very much
he looks around and notices the superintendents flashlight stuck up on top of a heating pipe
luc takes down the flashlight switches it on and continues his search for the dead parasite
tudor lies on top of janine on their bed
over his shoulder janines face is visible eyes wide open and full of tears
she tries to push tudor away but he resists
frantically no no
i want to put my contacts in
i cant see anything
tudor pulls her back to him and finally she is forced to batter him away with her fists and slip off the edge of the bed
tudor glares after her
in a mechanical whine make love to me make love to me love love to me
trying to buy time i want to be able to see us nick
im going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts ok
is that ok
pleading with him to believe her i want to be able to see us when we make love ok
tudors eyes are staring right out of his head and his mouth is wide open
he gasps for breath
he stares at janine for a second then buries his face in the blankets twisting them in his hands and moaning
janine bursts into tears and turns away from the bed heading for the bathroom
in the bathroom janine starts to shake on the verge of hysteria
distractedly she goes through the motions of putting her contact lenses in opens the medicine cabinet door takes out the lens container takes out the bottles of wetting and soaking
solutions opens the lens container
suddenly tudor wails terribly like a hound from the bedroom
heart rending wail ooooooooooooooooo
janine turns to the door turns back to the lenses dumps both lenses out into her hand begins to squirt solution on them
she has decided to try to ignore tudor
wailing janine janine janinnnnnneeee
janine can no longer pretend that she doesnt hear him
closing her hand around the two lenses she runs out of the bathroom
tudor lies outstretched on the bed in the darkness
his lips move silently spasmically as though in sleep twitching in an abnormal insect fashion
there is a swelling in his throat almost as though he has developed a goiter which swells and contracts rhythmically
janine appears in the doorway
a strangled half whisper im here nick
janine is here
after a pause she walks into the room
she climbs on to the bed and settles down
she puts her face very close to tudors
for the moment his face is expressionless but his neck is swollen just under the jaw
janine sighs deeply trying not to panic
her eyes narrow suddenly she hasnt got her lenses in and her gaze is myopic as she notices something odd
there is a bit of black something a thread in the corner of tudors mouth
janine moves closer to it
the black thing like the tip of an insects leg twitches
janine reaches out to brush the thing off tudors lip
as her fingers brush by the leg twitches back inside tudors mouth
janine jerks back in horror her hands balled into fists cover her own mouth as though to protect it from whatever occupies tudors mouth
gradually the thread reappears
tudors lips part slightly to allow the emergence of the dark viscous tentacle to which the thread a hook used to hang on inside the body is attached
the tentacle of the blood parasite probes its way from between tudors lips
janine is paralyzed with horror
the tentacle is now touching tudors chin his cheek the tip of his nose
janines fists tighten even more
a glassy snap breaks the silence
janine lowers her hands dumbly and opens them
in the right one the one that held the contact lenses are incised two bloody circles where her fingers pressed the lenses into her flesh until they snapped
the segmented lens fragments glint in the tiny pools of blood
she tries to control the hysteria welling up inside her
she eases herself carefully over the side of the bed as the first stubby tentacle is joined by another and another
she moves a fraction of an inch at a time almost hypnotized by the movement of the tentacles
the hooks of the tentacles are now set into tudors chin and cheeks and the tentacles draw taut as something attempts to draw itself out of his body
his throat bulges his cheeks swell as the tentacles contract
his lips are gradually forced apart as the quivering moist shape emerges
his mouth is opened to jaw breaking width as the creature slowly exposes itself to the dim light of the bedroom
janines eyes are wide with terror
she utters a gurgling cry and runs stumbling from the bedroom
she dashes through the living room and reaches the door to the hallway whimpering in terror as she fumbles at the lock and the doorknob finally managing to swing the
janine runs down a hallway that leads to bettss apartment sobbing and stumbling
she gets to bettss door and opens it without hesitation
janine enters betts apartment
she looks around for betts
she catches sight of betts standing out on the balcony looking across at the north towers lights
betts turns slowly
she is wearing immaculate but very extreme make up
janine is slightly taken aback its not betts style
betts smiles and opens her arms to janine
rollo puts his jacket on picks up his doctors bag and a manila envelope jammed solid with hobbess notes and leaves his lab turning off the lights and locking the
door behind him
rollo gets into his car which is parked in a now empty parking lot adjacent to the building in which his lab is situated
his car is large and american and ostentatious a gold cadillac eldorado with options or equivalent
the car pulls out of the lot and on to the street
the doorman drooling and twitching locks the exit doors at the end of one hallway
in one hand he holds an enormous pair of cable cutters
luc continues to poke around inside the incinerator with the poker
finally his flashlight beam reveals the tattered corpse of spergazzis parasite
deftly manipulating the hook on the pokers tip st
luc manages to pull the parasite out into the light
garbage comes rattling down the chute
luc flashes his light into the oven we see that the garbage consists of betts french food half eaten silver servers and all the snails being especially prominent
insane giggles echo down the chute followed by the slam of the chute door somewhere several floors above
luc holds the thing up to the naked light bulb above the incinerator
the light seems to go right through the parasite illuminating the twisted vascular system reproductive organs etc
luc examines the creature which is still impaled on the hook of the poker the door to the incinerator room opens behind him
a large hairy muscular man enters the room and approaches the oblivious st
the man slips his arms up under st
lucs arms and kisses him passionately on the neck
as soon as st
luc realizes whats happening he smashes the man in the chest with his elbow and pulls free
the man grabs st
luc again trying to kiss him on the mouth
luc is thrown to the concrete floor
the man tries to pin him down
luc on the verge of being overpowered smashes the man in the chest with the poker parasite still hooked into its tip
the man stands up unsteadily
luc cracks him on the ankle with the poker and he comes crashing down
the parasite corpse is flung across the room where it smacks wetly into the wall and slides to the floor
luc leaps to his feet and begins kicking the man in the head
after a furious moment or two he suddenly stops drops the poker and stares at the body in horrified disbelief
luc slowly backs away from the mans body which is very still and quietly oozes blood on to the damp concrete floor
he bumps into the edge of the door left open by the man
the collision seems to startle him out of his daze somewhat and he turns himself scratched and bleeding and staggers up the basement steps
forsythe waits impatiently for st
spergazzi is watching a variety show on tv and mrs
spergazzi is making ravioli in the kitchen more or less recovered from her encounter with the parasite
suddenly a piercing scream is heard from down the hall
spergazzi hard of hearing doesnt notice
the scream is followed by bangs crashes and insane laughter and giggling
spergazzi comes out of the kitchen
she has heard the noises
she and forsythe look at each other for a moment then forsythe goes to the door and slides the chain lock into place
she then goes to the telephone to call the police
into receiver hello
she dials a few times and clicks the receiver button
the phone is dead
she puts the receiver back on the hook
spergazzi knows that something is very wrong
she wrings her hands and begins to wail in italian
in the hallway outside the spergazzi apartment a group of giggling drooling residents stand around a door
one of these residents is the superintendent who is opening the door with one of his set of master keys
the residents some of them women giggle in anticipation
once the door has been opened they all rush in drooling and moaning
from inside the apartment we hear several muffled voices at first angry and indignant then pleading and terrified
screams and crashes follow
spergazzi is getting hysterical mr
spergazzi is trying to calm her down by getting her to sit in front of the tv set with him
but each time he pushes her down she pops up and begins wailing and moaning again
forsythe paces back and forth checks her watch paces some more
finally after a particularly noisy outburst by mrs
spergazzi forsythe picks up the doctors bag unchains the door and leaves
spergazzi hears the door slam and looks up
cabiria she needs something
he lapses back into italian trying vainly to calm his wife down
betts and janine are on the sofa janine with her head in bettss lap betts rocking janine like a child
sobbing oh betts betts everything is so hideous
everything dies and rots and disappears
im going to die and youre going to die and nick
she breaks down
betts is drowsy eyed and smiling
she strokes janines hair
there there there
it all gets sorted out in the genes and chromosomes
its not for us to think about at all
its not our problem at all nine
were just here to exist and to have a good time
exist and have a good time
pause do i feel good nine
do i feel good to you
janines eyes are red and she still sobs a bit as she speaks but she is obviously feeling a bit soothed
oh you feel very good betts
you have such a cosy body
im jealous im so skinny
casually as though it were the most ordinary request in the world make love to me nine
i want you to make love to me
please please make love to me
janine twists around and looks up at betts
there is something in betts tone quite apart from what she is saying that disturbs her something that reminds her of her husband
you cant really be saying that
you just cant
betts smiles drowsily
she bends over janine turning her head in her hands until they face each other
betts lowers her face toward janine
janine is wide eyed almost hypnotized by bettss strength smile and confidence
lets not talk any more nine shall we
lets kiss and make up
kiss and make up shall we
janine resists only slightly as betts places her lips on janines
after a pause betts suddenly opens her mouth wide and presses her lips savagely against janines
she holds janines head firmly as they kiss
janine struggles for a moment then opens her mouth as well
her eyes are closed in passion then suddenly open wide in terror as bettss throat swells like a goiter as a parasite rushes up her throat toward janines open mouth
the parasite begins to force its way into janines mouth and down her throat
janine gags and tries to pull away but too late
forsythe runs down the steps which lead to the incinerator and pulls open the steel door at the bottom
she begins to look around for st
roger are you here
she suddenly stumbles across the body of the man st
luc has killed
she actually has to break her fall with her hands which slip in the mans blood
horrified she gets up and backs away
the sounds of people moaning and laughing are coming from everywhere
forsythe finds herself up against a large door
she tugs on the handle and it opens
luc has made his way to the main doors and stands talking to the rental agent merrick who is leaning against the intercom board with the doormans pocketbook romance in
the agent looks perfectly normal though he keeps wiping his mouth unobtrusively with the back of his hand
havent seen anything that looks like trouble at all
just filling in for walter
but if you want me to call the police i will
luc is cautious but he seems to believe merrick
he presses the button which buzzes the spergazzi apartment
a middle aged man walks in
luc buzzes again
visiting my sister
merrick smiles and opens the door for the man who goes in and takes the stairway up preferring to walk
the intercom squawks and spergazzi answers the buzzer
who is there
luc mr spergazzi
let me speak to the nurse please
oh but the nurse she went away
i think she must go to look for you
luc curses under his breath and makes a move toward the door
merrick smiles and pulls it open for him
luc disappears down the stairs leading to the incinerator
as the stairway doors close the elevators slide open and a young couple come out heading for the main doors dressed to go out to a late party
before they reach the doors merrick slips through them and meets the couple in the lobby
he smiles broadly as he approaches them
wolf miss lewis
i wonder if i could talk to you for a second in my office
why dont you do something about all that noise
we like parties but this is ridiculous
well there may be a connection
see its about your locker
fraid somebody busted into it tonight
together oh no
what a drag
ive got a few of the things they threw around in my office and if you could identify it
the couple turn grumbling and walk toward merricks office
merrick follows wiping his mouth with the back of his hand
the young couple enter the rental office merrick following close behind
once they are all in merrick closes the door
he rests against the door and drools copiously then giggles
the young couple turn to look at him
suddenly three more residents two women and a man all of them half naked jump down on them from the tops of large filing cabinets
the residents begin to kiss and paw the couple
merrick wipes his mouth with the back of his hand and then throws himself on top of the writhing mass
finding herself in the underground garage forsythe decides to get in her car and drive out
she finds her car a datsun or toyota gets in throws the doctors bag in the back and drives up the ramp leading to the sliding garage doors
the car rolls over the cable which normally activates the doors but nothing happens
forsythe puts the car in reverse and backs over the cable but still nothing happens
she sits with the car idling trying to figure out what to do next
suddenly the drivers door of her car is yanked open and the doorman slavering and drooling throws himself at her
the doorman forces her down across the front seats of the car and begins to kiss her on the neck and rip her clothes to shreds
he gradually forces himself between her legs
luc bounds down the incinerator room stairs looking for forsythe
he sees immediately that she is not there but also notices handprints in blood on the door leading to the garage
he opens the garage door
forsythes screams come echoing through the garage
luc races through the garage trying to find forsythe
he finally sees her car in the middle of the exit ramp and runs over to it
the doorman is still on top of forsythe in the front seat of the car
luc pulls the doormans gun out of its holster and begins smashing away at the doorman with it
the doorman pounds st
luc in the temple with his fist and lifts himself partially off forsythe half turning toward st
luc who is staggered by the blow
the doormans face is covered with blood and drool
repulsed and terrified st
luc fires the gun into the doormans upper body three times heedless of the possibility that he might hit forsythe
the doorman slumps over forsythe
luc grips the gun and staggers over to the car
he pulls the doorman off forsythe who is completely soaked with blood
she has obviously had an externally rough time but there is nothing to suggest that she has been infected by the doorman
luc shoves her over into the passengers seat where she slumps dazed
he doesnt have to start the car its never been turned off
he slams the shift lever into reverse and backs up peeling rubber to the base of the ramp
he puts it into first and begins to accelerate foot to the floor toward the garage door
another car full of residents suddenly careens in front of the door and screeches to a halt blocking st
luc who in swerving to avoid them smashes his fender into a concrete post
he picks up the gun from the console between the seats and opening the car door empties the gun at the residents who are emerging from their car
one of the residents falls back into the car blocking the other two
luc drags forsythe out of the car throws her over his shoulder and carries her down the ramp toward the door leading to the incinerator
luc half drags half carries forsythe along hallways whose doors are wide open
from the apartments issues the entire catalogue of suggestive sexual sounds giggles moans groans cries whispers shrieks
we catch glimpses of people of all kinds and ages locked together on floors chairs etc
luc finds an open exit door and plunges through it taking forsythe with him
the door to the gym opens and st
luc looks in cautiously
the gym is quite tiny and is deserted
luc pulls forsythe in and closes the door
he lays forsythe down on a gym mat and then barricades the door with a box horse and a weight lifting table
he kneels beside forsythe who seems to be only just regaining consciousness
luc strokes her face pushes strands of hair matted with blood out of her eyes
more to himself than forsythe rolloll be here soon
rolloll be here soon
rollos car pulls up to the main doors and parks in a blatantly illegal space
he flips up a card on the dash which says m
on call then gets out of the car
he walks up the steps and through the main doors which are wide open
nobody is in sight
rollo walks along the hallway bag in hand envelope under arm
he stops in front of tudors door checks the number against the number written in his notebook then knocks on the door
he knocks once more then looks around shiftily before turning the knob and walking right in
rollo enters and closes the door behind him deliberately slamming it
he walks into the center of the living room and bellows
hello good evening is anybody here
linsky here to see you for consultation
still no answer
rollo is puzzled
he snoops around the apartment until he finds the bedroom with its door half closed
he pushes gently on the door and opens it gradually
rollo can now see the figure of tudor lying in bed in the dim light of the bedroom
rollo enters the bedroom
is that mr
im meeting dr
he must be a little bit late
tudor does not answer does not move
he lies stiffly on the bed on his back mouth insanely agape eyes shut covers half on the floor
is anyone here
is that you
mind if i have a look at you
he stands at the edge of the bed peering at tudor looking for signs of consciousness
after a pause he kneels on the bed and slowly draws back the covers
just a peek ok
a little peek wont hurt
tudors abdomen is gradually exposed as the covers are drawn back
crouched in the shadows is one of the freshly emerged blood parasites which sits poised for only a fraction of a second before it springs at rollos face with great
as the thing hits rollos face it locks on to his head by entangling its stubby tentacles in his hair and attaching its suckers to his cheeks and chin
rollo tries to stand then staggers and falls
the thing tries to force its way into rollos mouth cutting his lips in the process
they bleed furiously
when rollo manages to pull a sucker away a piece of his flesh comes with it
as he writhes on the carpeted floor two more parasites appear crawling toward him from under the bed covered with dust from the floor
they clamber on to him and fasten on to his face suckering on to his ears his throat forehead eyelids
one of them begins to ooze corrosive fluid on to his face
rollo screams in pain
he manages to roll to his feet
he staggers out of the darkness of the bedroom into the living room one arm extended groping like a blind man the three parasites still locked on to his face
they try to pull his lips apart but he keeps his teeth firmly clenched to keep them from forcing their way into the depths of his body
he takes a few unbalanced steps toward the kitchen
with a sudden spasm of pain he hurls himself sideways into the kitchen and almost falls again grabbing at the last moment on to the sink
his hands touch a large pair of pliers a screwdriver and a hammer on the counter by the sink left there by tudor weeks ago
rollo seizes the pliers and begins to pull the parasites from his face with their steel jaws
the parasites swollen with tudors blood burst and spurt as the pliers tear them apart
in the bedroom tudors eyes snap open
his head rises from the pillow
he swings his legs over the side of the bed and ashen and gaunt shakes his head slowly as though waking from a dream
he begins to mumble
no no no no
you mustnt kill them no no no
then as though listening to himself and suddenly understanding what he is saying he rises to his feet shakily and walks to the kitchen
he stops at the kitchen door
rollo has torn the parasites from his face and is pounding away at them in the kitchen sink
the parasites wriggle and curl in their own blood in the sink as he smashes away at them with the pliers
tudor staggers toward rollo
you mustnt kill them
thats my blood youre spilling
let them come home let them come home home home inside me
dont kill them
he starts to paw rollo feebly trying to prevent him from further mutilating the parasites
he reaches over st
lucs shoulder and grabs a large chunk of one of the parasites
whining pitifully at least save me one
for gods sake
at least save me one
one one one one
rollo turns as tudor begins to shove the piece of flesh back down his throat
as rollo turns we see that bits of tentacles and suckers are still attached to his cheeks throat forehead
his face is melting and smoking in areas where it has been burned by the corrosive fluid on one side
he stares in rage at tudor
with a scream rollo strikes tudor with the pliers
tudor falls hitting his head on various chairs and protruding corners as he goes down the chunk of parasite still in his mouth as he finally comes to rest twitching
on the floor
rollo drops the pliers on the floor
he stares at tudor in shock
his face is reflected in a copper frying pan hanging over the stove
noticing the reflection rollo leans over to get close to his own horrible image
he gingerly touches his face inspecting the damage shivering and moaning
still shaking he turns to leave
without warning tudor leaps up at rollo with insane energy and bowls him over pliers in hand
sitting on rollos chest tudor smashes away at rollos face and head with the pliers the piece of dead parasite in his mouth dropping on to rollos face as he
forsythe finally opens her eyes
she smiles at st
luc who hovers anxiously over her as she lies on the gym mat
can you walk
i couldnt find anything wrong with you
forsythe nods and manages to sit up with st
once she seems able to stay propped up without st
lucs help he gets up and begins to move the barricade away from the door
rollo and the police should be here by now
its just a question of avoiding infected residents until we find them
luc comes back to forsythe and kneels beside her
ready to go
forsythe puts her arm around st
lucs neck as though wanting support
instead she draws him down toward her and begins to babble in a strange casual dreamy way
sometimes i have a recurrent dream
have i ever told you about it darling
i guess you could call it a freudian dream because in this dream i find myself making love to sigmund freud
but im having trouble because hes old and dying and he smells bad and i find him repulsive
and then he tells me that everything is erotic everything is sexual you know what i mean
he has a very thick accent but i can understand him perfectly
he tells me that even old flesh is erotic flesh that disease is the love of two alien kinds of creatures for each other that dying is an act of
eroticism that even chemicals combine out of sexual frenzy and longing
that breathing is sexual that talking is sexual that just to physically exist is sexual
and i believe him and we make love beautifully
while she talks forsythe gradually slips her arms around st
lucs neck and brings her lips closer and closer to his
luc mesmerized by the hypnotic drone of her words is about to kiss her
suddenly her mouth snaps open wide with mechanical precision her head tilts back her eyes flick closed
luc stares at her in horror as her throat begins to swell
in the depths of forsythes mouth two parasite tentacles probe about seeking a firm hold for their suckers so that they can pull the parasites body out of her narrow
luc hesitates only for an instant then rips a strip from her blouse balls it up and shoves it into her mouth
holding her while she struggles to remove it he rips off a second strip and ties it around her head to keep the gag in
luc rises throws forsythe over his shoulder and begins to step toward the door of the gym
dangling over st
lucs shoulder forsythe struggles moans and howls as best she can
luc manages to pin her hands to her sides so that she cant pull the gag out
luc reaches the door a handsome middle aged woman peeks in around the corner
crooning in reply to forsythes howl hellooooo
is there anyone here whos all alooooooooone
luc rushes at the woman knocking her over
she rolls on the floor hugging herself and crooning
once out the door st
luc makes for the nearest exit
luc begins to ascend the stairs we can see tiny black hooks tearing through forsythes gag
blood begins to soak through from the inside
a group of residents suddenly appear at the next landing above st
luc and noticing them begin to walk down the steps moaning and crooning and making vaguely sexual gestures toward the pair
blood is now pouring from forsythes mouth and tentacles are groping for leverage at her cheeks and chin
luc decides to attempt to shoulder his way up the stairs certain that rollo and the police must be at the main doors
as he hits the residents on the stairs they try to kiss him caress him pull his clothes off
they finally manage to drag forsythe from his shoulders almost unbalancing him as they do so
luc tries to prop her up on her feet but shes completely limp
luc holds forsythe against the stairway wall as residents mill all about them
he looks at her in sudden hopelessness
the parasite is now half out of her mouth hanging through the slit it has torn in her gag
luc lets go of forsythe and she sinks to the floor
the residents are swarming all over them
luc abandons forsythe and begins to fight his way up the stairs
he runs higher and higher up flight after flight of stairs until he is free of the slow moving residents
he leans back against a wall panting
crooning and moaning echo up to him from below
he leans over the railing and looks down
in the stairwell several flights below forsythe lies surrounded by milling residents legs spread as though about to give birth
a resident leans over and pulls the parasite from her mouth then swallows it whole with gusto
other residents touch her stroke her caress her as though offering her a strange kind of comfort
luc reels with disgust and disbelief
he turns and runs
between the two towers lies the swimming pool
luc manages to reach the door leading from the south tower into the pool
he hangs on to the door of the pool itself for a moment in near exhaustion then opens it and enters
the pool is dim and tranquil
two women are swimming in the deep end as though nothing were at all abnormal
luc watches them for a moment enjoying the apparent normalcy of the scene
then he staggers forward calling out to the swimmers
have you seen the police
have you seen the police
have they come
the swimmers both flick playfully beneath the waters surface
luc approaches the waters edge waiting for them to surface
the water ripples and bubbles near his feet
a sinking feeling comes over him
he watches in horrible fascination
he begins to shiver
the ripples and bubbles spread and intensify
after a pause janine surfaces smiling radiantly
a few seconds later betts surfaces near her the very picture of benign watery calm
betts gestures to st
luc to join them in the pool
luc shakes his head slowly backing away from the pool
he turns to leave the room
as he turns mr
spergazzi appears out of the shadows behind him
using his four pronged aluminum cane he pushes st
luc backwards into the pool chuckling playfully
spergazzi looks around for approval as st
luc begins to thrash about wildly
betts swims up beside st
luc grabs him and holds him under
to janine a kiss
laughter echoes in the pool room give him a kiss
give him a kiss
voices echoing in unison a kiss a kiss a kiss
betts allows st
luc to rise to the surface as a laughing janine splashes over to him and fastens her mouth to his
as they kiss janines hands hold st
lucs head fiercely
betts assists her by pinning st
lucs arms behind him
janines throat ripples and swells her cheeks billow as a parasite swarms upwards from deep within her body
lucs cheeks now swell as the parasite enters his mouth
his eyes jolt open in terror and he manages to pull away slightly revealing the tentacles joining her mouth to his like grappling irons
luc twists out of betts grasp
he and janine still locked together sink beneath the surface
dozens of residents pour into the pool room and join spergazzi and the others at the poolside
among these are faces already familiar to us kurt kresimir and benda the old laundry room woman etc
the new spectators clap laugh croon and moan as though witnessing a wild group baptism
some of them throw themselves into the water pulling others in with them
deep under the waters surface st
luc still struggles to free himself from janine
residents now splash into the depths all around them
lucs cheeks bulge wide and blood dribbles from his nose and mouth
his throat swells monstrously
janine releases him just in time for us to see the end of a tentacle slip back into his mouth
he exhales heavily as parasite enzymes pump furiously through his body
the water boils with his exhaled breath
janine and st
luc drift apart now completely calm as residents splash and swim kick and embrace
the vast and dimly lit garage is full of silent cars
somewhere an engine starts up then another and another until the whole garage is full of fumes and the revving of engines
as we prowl amongst the cars we find many of the residents we already know now dressed to the teeth in their seductive best
spergazzi and his wife stand and watch the spectacle canes in hand with great dignity
with them stand others who are too old or too young to go into the night looking for new hosts for their parasites content to remain incubators for the time
the residents are full of bubbly anticipation in their cars
kresimir leans out of his car and shouts to no one in particular
shouting nobody should be alone
nobody should be alone tonight
the rest of the residents pick up the cry and chant together
together nobody alone
the night watchman stands near the garage doors
smiling broadly he stamps on the cable which activates the sliding doors
the garage doors slide open
one car surges up the ramp ahead of all the others stopping at the top
the driver of this first car is st
luc sleek and exuberant a raised collar and a scarf hiding most of his scars
he glances into his rear view mirror
in the rear view mirror st
luc sees all the other cars lining up behind him lights blazing
luc smiles then steps on the accelerator
his car shoots out into the street
lucs car turns on to the street car after car follows him
we rise higher and higher above the starliner towers apartment complex until the cars are a small stream of lights far below bleeding into the main body of the neon
