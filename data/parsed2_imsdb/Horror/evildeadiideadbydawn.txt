evil dead ii seventh draft by sam raimi and scott spiegel sam raimi scott spiegel seventh draft may a sound is building
like a living wind
a thousand screams in agony
from the blackness gusts of smoke pull together quickly forming the main title against black then beneath it the roman numeral ii
a slow zoom brings it toward us
and as the screams reach their sharp crescendo the title zooms through us
whisping smoke against a black background
in the distance through the smoke a small object
it fans toward us quickly filling the frame
it is an ancient skin covered volume with the outline of a human face on its cover
this is the book of the dead
legend has it that it was written by the dark ones roughly translated
the book of the dead
the face on the cover of the book pulls away from its skin binding and leans toward the camera
eyes on the book blink open and peer at us
its mouth opens and emits a hideous scream
the camera races into the blackness of the screaming mouth
to trace the origin of the book we must go back
to a day when spirits ruled the earth
wispy shapes of animated ghosts move through this vortex coming toward the camera with wailing and moaning and then are gone
when the seas ran red with blood
a raging ocean of blood
great waves rise and swell as if before a storm
it was this blood that was used to ink the book
through animation the blank pages of the book are scripted in a strange hieroglyphic by an invisible hand
faster and faster the pages turn on the book as the blood red ink is scrawled across them
the pages flip furiously until the book snaps shut reveal ing its gruesome face on the cover
the book flaps violently away from camera
the book of the dead was last seen in a
camera panning down to reveal a magnificent newly built castle of stone
bright banners fly from its turrets
an ox grazes nearby
warriors on horseback in the bg
it was then that the dark spirits again rose up to battle the living
the ground in front of the castle begins to split apart
a red glow and smoke pour from the growing crevice
something evil is being unleashed
a strong wind kicks up blowing sand in a furious rage
through the blowing silt a lone figure appears
an image of power and light
his clothing is ragged and he holds what appears to be a jagged toothed longsword
two massive columns of stone stand on either side
camera slowly moves closer but his face is still hidden by the darkness and blowing sands
it is said that a hero came from the sky
a man who defeated this evi and buried the book in the castle of kandar
and there it lay for years
as the raging dust storm clears to reveal the same castle which we saw earlier but now in a ruined state
it has aged years
the ox is gone
now only its petrified skeletal remains stand in a weathered heap
a four wheel drive vehicle roars past the camera and toward the castle
the camera slowly tracks in toward the book of the dead as it sits in the darkness of the stone tomb
next to it rests the kandarian dagger an ancient knife its handle fashioned from the skull of a weasel
they rest upon a small pedestal covered with cobwebs
prominently displayed on the stone wall a bas relief of the hero from the sky holding his unusual jagged edged weapon
the grinding of rock scraping against rock is heard and a large stone is swung open on a secret hinge in the wall behind the book
wind sweeps in through the tomb along with the blinding light from outside
a sharply silhouetted figure steps in the newly created doorway
the figure lights a torch that he holds illuminating his face
this is professor raymond knowby
an intelligent grey bearded man in his late fifties
he lowers the cloth around his face that had been protecting him from the sand
he stares at the book awestruck
behind him two other figures appear in the entrance of the tomb
the first is a large school marmish woman the wife of raymond knowby henrietta
she moves to raymonds side and takes his hand
immediately behind her is their daughter annie knowby twenty four years old strong stance and beautiful
behind her a handsome looking man ed getly enters the tomb
he moves to annies side
they exchange excited glances
the camera pans down to the book
billowing past the camera in front of a black drape
an old log cabin built in the valley of a dark forest
a great wind billows fog about the place
professor raymond knowby and his wife henrietta brought the book to a small cabin where they could study it undisturbed
professor raymond knowby sits at a writing desk and transcribes passages from the book of the dead
a small framed photograph of his daughter annie sits upon the table
behind him henrietta sits knitting in a rocking chair
he speaks the phonetic pronunciation of completed sentences into the microphone of a tape recorder
ear grets gat
nos feratos amantos
the sound of raymond reciting the passages is faded down as the camera slowly tracks away from raymond and over to henrietta as she rocks back into the darkness and
forward into the light
as she rocks forward into the light she comes into full closeup revealing that her eyes have changed to a milky white
she continues to knit
blowing past the camera in front of black drape
a dank fruit cellar with shelves of half rotten preserves
raymond has his back to the stone wall
he is dictating into the tape recorder sweating and distraught
it has only been a few hours since ive translated and spoke aloud the first of the demon resurrection passages from the book of the dead
the sound of heavy footsteps
dust drifts down into frame
raymond looks up to the ceiling of the cellar
it is also the floor to the main room of the cabin
he watches in horror as henriettas silhouette paces the floor above him
and then the footsteps halt
and now i fear that my wife has become host to a kandarian demon
may god forgive me for what i have unleashed onto this earth
the milky eyed possessed figure of henrietta jolts quickly into the frame and shrieks in the voice of a demon
raymond knowby screams
he drops the microphone
as the microphone falls atop it
high pitched feed back screams from the speaker
screaming in terror
his fearful eyes fill the screen as the scream continues
darting about wildly and the scream continues
camera moving swiftly down a dark tunnel
a light at the end growing closer
the sound of air rushing by
the delta oldsmobile comes roaring out of the tunnel with a blast of air and the sound of loud rock and roll music
it was one week later that a group of college students came to the cabin
the delta oldsmobile parked out front
fog roars past the place
we faintly hear waltz music from within
the silhouette of a woman sweeps by the rear bedroom window
linda an attractive college student is waltzing in the semi darkness of the bedroom
she wears a michigan state university sweatshirt
she hums melodically to the music as she moves
around her neck is draped a delicate silver necklace
a handsome young man ash is playing the waltz music on an old wooden piano
linda dances behind him
ash is not a very good pianist and can only plunk out the melody with two fingers
ash whats that youre playing
ash begins to play faster
as she picks up the tempo spinning and laughing until finally ash moves to her halting her in mid spin
out of breath hair tousled across her eyes she stares deeply into ashs eyes
her lips parted in a sensual manner
he returns her stare lost in her beauty
he pulls her close
and looks down to the tiny silver necklace that she wears about her neck
in its center is a magnifying glass
she looks from the necklace to ash
i really love it
ill never take it off
they kiss and now begin to dance together to the haunting waltz melody that sweeps up upon the soundtrack
it was in the cabins cellar that they found the professors tape recorder and the book of the dead
camera tracks in toward the trap door
it opens by itself as we move down the steps into the blackness
the camera pans down from the blackness to ash who finds a shotgun raymond knowbys tape recorder tapes the kandarian dagger and
the shattered photograph of annie knowby and the book of the dead
the group of students sit about the fire as they listen to the tape recorder
coming from the speaker is the voice of raymond knowby reciting the demon resurrection passage
on tape kan da es trata ta toon hazan sobar ear grets gat
linda takes ashs hand
ash smiles to comfort her
she nervously fingers the silver locket she wears about her neck
on tape nos feratos
the cabin is in the distance
in the foreground the earth begins to swell then rips apart as a red glow emanates from beneath
something evil is being unleashed
one by one they fell to the possession of the dark spirits
her eyes pop open
they are bone white
she has fallen to the possession
possessed linda is coming after ash
ash back peddles stumbles and falls
as the shadow of approaching linda envelops ash he picks up a shovel from the ground
ash swings the shovel slicing off lindas head
lindas head rolls down the hillside and disappears into the darkness
ash buries lindas headless body
he jams a crude wooden burial cross into the earth of the grave
a bolt of lightning strikes
as he runs from the grave site and toward the cabin
one man ash destroyed the book
ash enters the cabin
he sees the book of the dead and tosses it onto the flames
a possessed demon begins to wither and melt
flesh shrinks away from its skull and dissolves to nothing
but the evil that had been resurrected from it lives on
the book of the dead is burned to cinders
the face upon the book screams as it burns
ash picks himself up from the floor
ash stands and clutches the necklace of linda in sorrow for his loss of her
ash staggers from the cabin
we are racing forward
we have taken the pov of an evil entity as it glides with dark purpose through a section of woods
it approaches the rear door of the cabin
the door is torn violently open
the next door falls away from us
we approach the front door
it jigsaws in two and we are again outside now in front of the cabin
ash is seen in the distance
he is staggering away his back to us as we race at him
he turns suddenly towards camera and screams
the final shot of evil dead i has a new ending an extension
ash is caught by an invisible grip
g force is distorting ashs face as he is rocketed backwards
he is swept hand over foot through the air
he reaches the edge of the woods and begins tearing through the branches and smaller trees clearing a path with his body
he finally slams into a large ungiving tree trunk and he is knocked unconscious
as he falls from the tree branch and plummets towards the earth
a puddle of mud below which rushes up upon us quickly
as his head splashes down into the muddy water
he lifts his face from the mud and turns toward us
his eyes have gone white
his skin is now a pale color his lips jet black
he is possessed
a bright edge of morning sunlight moves across his face
he turns his beastly face skyward
long shot the sun miniature rising over a mountain ridge
sunlight streaming through a gaping hole in the parting clouds in bright shafts
it pours through the trees
closer on the sun as it looms larger and brighter
the frame is filled with the rising sun
the bright edge of morning sunlight spreading across his face he lets loose a demonic death shriek
the white in ashs eyes swirls about and his pupils change back to their original brown color
ash no longer possessed collapses into the mud puddle unconscious
streams of morning sunlight pierce the darkness of the woods
we hear the shriek of demons
the sound of sizzling
a great wind blows back fog into the darker sections of the woods
the scene grows brighter and the peaceful sounds of morning are faded up
as he lies unconscious
his eyes open
they stare blankly up at the sky
then fear registers and we crane back quickly revealing a vast area of empty woods around ash
he sits up slowly into frame looking fearfully about
panning the battered cabin and sections of the woods
all is peaceful
the sound of birds tweeting
he looks up to the sky
just above the horizon
suns driven it away
gotta get the hell out of here
before night falls
as he nods to himself then suddenly glances up beyond the camera
a perfectly normal log cabin with one exception superimposed over the front of the place is
a hideous human skull with living eyeballs that stare out at us with evil malice
the eyes stare out from the two dark windows
the dark nose area is the open doorway and the rotted teeth of the skull are the whitewashed stones placed at the foot of the cabin
then it fades leaving only the cabin
he shudders uncontrollably as he picks himself up from the mud
ash moves into a close up
his eyes shift back and forth like a trapped animal as he looks about for a means of escape
he spots something
parked in front of the cabin
he shifts his glance from the car to the road
a narrow dirt road cutting through the woods
then the delta roars down it and past the camera
it kicks up dust and gravel
ash is driving
he wipes the mud and blood from his face with a rag
as he pulls the rag away his face forms a sudden look of horror as he sees a giant steel hand looms towards us
it is the twisted remains of the steel and wood bridge that crossed a great mountain chasm
a loud screech of brakes is heard on the soundtrack on this cut
as it pulls to a halt
ash steps quietly from the car
he looks at the bridge
a sign hangs from the twisted girders
it reads risk
beyond this we see the twisted remnants of the former bridge and the rock cliffs far away on the other side
ash gapes at the uncrossable chasm
he is stunned at the sight
his only escape gone
he looks from the bridge to the west
the sun is now resting on the horizon
lower than it was before
it is blood red and sets in the course of seven seconds
to reveal ash as he looks from the sunset to the ruined bridge to the road behind him
he moves in halting steps not knowing which way to turn
ash opens his mouth draws in his breath and just as he begins to scream we cut to as it rises up from what appears to be the mountain chasm
and reveals the opposite side of the twisted girders which form the giant hand
it spots ash immediately beyond
it moves swiftly towaad him
ash looks up sensing the evil and darts into the delta
the force moves through the twisted girders pushing them away violently and races towaad the car
the delta starts up and peels off
the evil force just misses it
the car doesnt have the room to complete the one hundred and eighty degree turn necessary to head back down the road the way it originally came and is forced
into a line of break away trees which explode into sawdust as the front of the delta rips through them
the car swerves onto the road headed back toward the cabin
as the broken bits of tree slam against his windshield
as the channel switches suddenly to the hard rock song journey to the center of your mind which blares within the car throughout the chase to follow
as it gives chase to the delta
alongside the car as it barrels along the wooded road
as he drives this wild course
as it begins to gain on the speeding automobile
looking through the windshield as branches beat and smash themselves against the windshield obscuring our vision of the road ahead
our view suddenly clears revealing a large tree that looms directly ahead
swerving the wheel
it swerves and slams into a rotted tree stopping it dead
as he is rocketed forward from his seat
as ash comes ripping through the windshield and past the camera
as he approaches the ground with a great velocity
as he slams into the earth with a rain of glass
he moans and gets to his feet
as it sweeps down out of the woods pushing over trees and approaches the delta
steam pours from the hood of the car
as he runs
his face is cut and bleeding
as he runs toward the cabin
actually he is running in place in the rear of a camera car that is slowly backing away from the cabin
the more he runs the farther away from the cabin he gets
it approaches the rear of the delta rips through the back window moves through the cars interior music still blasting and bursts out the remains of the front windshield
we move through the steam of the radiator and approach ash as he runs for the cabin
as he runs toward the cabin not making much progress as though caught running in a nightmare
he shakes his head no
now closer to the cabin
again ash is running in place in the camera car as it slowly backs away from the cabin
now quickly gaining its lost ground
just a few feet behind ash
as he runs up the porch steps to the cabin
we race into the cabin splintering the hall door which ash had swung shut
ash retreats into the rear hallway and swings the hallway door shut
we race right up to the door and it shatters into many pieces as we glide forward
camera moves through the main room and up to the hallway door
it shatters in front of us
we close in on ash as he races down the hallway
we lose him as he swings into the back bedroom of the cabin and slams the door behind him
we rip through this door and enter the rear bedroom only to see ash scrambling for the door to the middle bedroom which we approach and he swings shut in
we rip through to reveal ash scurrying into the hallway
we follow him through the bathroom the maze and back out into the hallway
we round the corner after him and see that ash has led us into the main room but there is not a trace of him
we look about for him but he is gone
the hallway is bare except for a few dry leaves
the force begins to pull back with an ever increasing speed out the front door of the cabin and deep into the blackness of the woods
a static shot of the fireplace
all is quiet
smoke from the near dead fire wafts up the chimney
we hold on this for a moment
a static shot of a closet with its door half open
the door begins to swing slightly open revealing a rack of clothes inside
we hold on this for a moment
a writing desk with some papers atop it
they begin to tremble and finally blow away from the light breeze that sweeps through the cabin
the camera pans down from this desk to reveal a trap door in the floor of the main room
the trap door to the cellar
it is raised up on its hinge an inch or so and in that slight space between the trap door and the floor we see ashs eyes looking cautiously about
he breathes a sigh of relief
the cabin in the distance
fog rolls past
ed getly stands in the fg and watches as an older style twin engine cargo plane flies over the camera and lands
the airplane rolls to a halt
a man wearing a jumpsuit ties the airplane off and blocks the wheels while a redcap opens the hatch and helps out annie knowby
she carries a glass case in her hand as she moves toward us
behind her five other passengers emerge from the plane
ed approaches annie
smiling at sight of him hi
they embrace and kiss
howd everything go on the expedition
i found the additional pages from the book of the dead
so you said in the telegram
what condition are they in
she holds out the glass case for ed to look at
inside are pages from the book of the dead
havent aged a day in three thousand years
when do we begin the translations
is everything all set with my father
should be but i havent spoken to him in a week what with no phone in that cabin
take us about an hour to get there
they arrive at the parking lot
two new sharp looking cheverolets and eds old style cheverolet
well take my car
ed opens the car trunk
behind him a redcap pulls up a large steamer trunk on a hand dolly
ed and the redcap hoist the steamer up into the cars trunk
annie you hinted in your telegram that your father was on to something with the first part of his translations
whats the big mystery
what has he found in the book of the dead
but just possibly
the doorway to another world
annie slams the car trunk
camera has taken the pov of the evil force as it glides eerily through the woods around trees and over rotted stumps
it moves over a rise revealing a clear view of the boarded cabin in the distance
it moves to the window and peering through the cracks in the boards we see ash asleep in the rocking chair
camera begins on hammer nails and planking which lay upon the cabin floor
camera pans to window
it is boarded up tight
camera pans to door
it is repaired
camera pans to ash who sleeps in the rocking chair in front of another boarded window
ash awakens suddenly sensing something the shotgun clutched in his lap
he lifts his head and turns to a whispering musical sound
harp like music
it is coming from the back bedroom of the cabin
as he stands and moves cautiously towards the rear bedroom
as he approaches the rear bedroom the music grows louder
as he enters the room he halts his gaze on the old wooden piano
as he moves to the piano
the sound is coming from within
suddenly the piano begins to play by itself ash draws back from it
it plays a waltz
now the piano music mixing with the harp like strings
the radiator next to the piano begins to release bursts of musical steam adding a wind section to this strange orchestra
as he listens to this haunting version of a waltz melody
he recognizes the music
it is the same music that ash had played earlier when linda was dancing
as steam spouts from the radiator pipes
as the piano keys depress and release themselves
the melody grows louder
as he lowers his head
his horror gives way to sadness
from his pocket he removes lindas delicate silver locket that dangles from the end of a chain
in the lockets center is a magnifying glass
he stares mournfully into the glass
he looks up sharply toward the main room
as they rip open splintering ashs reinforcements
wind sweeps in through the place as the curtains flutter wildly
through the window is a sweeping fog
ash runs through this room and into the main room
he moves to the window and looks out
wind blowing on his face from outside
a stark wooden cross marks lindas lonely grave
the tiny figure of ash can be seen looking off toward this hill
in the foreground is a crude burial cross and a mound of earth
the earth begins to crack and splinter
the wooden cross caves in and is swallowed as the headless corpse of linda pulls itself to its feet
the haunting waltz melody sweeps through the night air
his eyes illuminated by a shaft of light widen in amazement and horror as
the waltz melody fills the sound track and the rotting corpse that was linda begins to dance bending and swaying as she sweeps gracefully through the evening fog
a waltz of the dead
the style of dance begins to change
it becomes more primitive
the music changes to a more primal beat
the dance becomes sexually oriented
erotic with sharp pelvic thrusts and gyrating hip motions
lost in the horrific beauty he turns his head to a rumbling sound
lindas decapitated head rolls across the ground and up the hillside graveyard
as it leaps through the air and gracefully situates itself atop lindas neck she begins to spin yet her head remains in place never taking her eyes from ash
with a sensual twirl and leap she disappears into the evening mists
his eyes dart about trying to catch another glimpse of linda through the fog
linda swings sharply into frame completing the spin of her dance immediately in front of ash as the music abruptly halts
linda extends her dead arms towards ash
he screams as
lindas head rolls off of her neck and tumbles through space
as it tumbles through a void of blackness falling
as he screams himself awake
camera pulls back to reveal him sitting in the rocking chair
ash halts his scream getting control of himself
he looks to the window that had blown open
still boarded as though it had never been opened
just a crummy dr lindas decapitated head falls into frame and lands in ashs hands
it opens its eyes and looks to ash
hello lover i came from the other side of your dream to dance with you
a four foot long blackened tongue emerges from her mouth like a lashing serpent
the tongue enters ashs frame and forces itself into ashs mouth
screaming as he clutches at the head of his former love
the tongue instantly retracts inside her head
as it bites deeply into ashs right hand drawing blood
ash stands and rushes across the room screaming as he tries to rid himself of the head
as ash staggers painfully around the side of the cabin and towards the work shed lindas head still clamped to his hand
the door to the place is kicked open revealing ash and lindas head on the end of his hand
it is a room full of sawdust chains and power tools
old bones hang from the walls
as he places lindas head within the vice and tightens it around her then withdraws his hand
even now we have your darling lindas soul
she suffers in torment
as it rips away an old tarp revealing the chalk outline of where a chainsaw once was
wondering what has happened to the chainsaw
behind him the door to the shed bursts open and in comes the flailing headless body of linda charging at ash with the chainsaw buzzing high above her head
ash is screaming
ash grabs a large crowbar and swings it toward the approaching blade
the crowbar hits the bottom of the blade with a shower of sparks sending the buzzing saw flipping backward
the blade of the chainsaw swings upward and arcs back into headless linda imbedding itself in her neck
she goes nuts as the chainsaw bites its way into her chest cavity
she spins wildly about the room knocking into shelves as she tries to pull the blade free
she slams against the wall of the shed and slumps to the floor the chainsaw still buzzing
as he is splattered with black bile
he reaches down
as ash dislodges the spinning chainsaw from her
as he swings the chainsaw around and poises it above lindas head
from the chainsaw fumes of blue amoke
ash turns to the head and falters
she is no longer possessed
she looks as she did earlier in the film
a vision of beauty
she is again linda the woman ash loved
tears roll down from her eyes
please ash help me
i love you please dont hurt me
trying to fight his feelings he knows what he must do
he pumps the throttle on the saw
pleading with him
you promised me wed always be together
you swore to me
once again fully possessed and speaking in the voice of the demon
her eyes again white her flesh rotten
she opens her mouth and emits a jet stream of bile
as hes drenched in the face
linda begins to laugh at him in a wild high pitched squeal
he gains control of himself and steadies the saw
he brings down the spinning blade
and moves past the camera and towards the head
we are left looking at the wall of the work shed upon which we see the stark shadow of the ghastly deed
we hear the sound of spinning steel meeting bone and the screams of a demon
as it is splattered with blood
ash stumbles back into frame and falls against the wall now lit in crimson
he looks at the off screen carnage in terror
he begins to shake as though in shock
he trembles as he looks down at his hands they are covered in lindas blood
he wipes his hands on his pants and shirt trying to rid himself of it but only succeeds in painting himself with the stuff
ash screams a wild scream of fear and despair
it echoes off into the night
ash in a confused state as he staggers from the work shed and towards the cabin
again clutching the chainsaw
ash enters through the doorway
he pushes the door shut behind him and halts
we hear a creaking sound
it is coming from the main room of the cabin
he moves in the direction of the sound
curtains flutter on the partially boarded windows of the hall
ash moves slowly past them and towards the main room ahead
the gentle creaking sound grows louder
ash tosses down the saw and picks up the gun
ash enters from the hallway and turns his head to the sound
it rocks back and forth with a definitive motion halting for a moment at its pints furthest forward and backward as if some invisible thing was sitting there and rocking
he slowly approaches the chair scared shitless
the chair rocks in and out of frame in the foreground as ash takes halting steps towards it
ash gathers his courage and reaches out his hand to halt the rocking motion
slowly his hand approaches the chair
just as his hand goes to touch it the chair abruptly halts on its own accord
in a confused state as he backs away from the chair and into the wall
he turns and comes face to face with himself in a hanging framed mirror
he clutches at his face trying to reassure himself of his sanity
ashs reflection becomes an independent entity
it reaches out of the mirror and grabs ahold of ash by his throat
the reflection looks like a mr
hyde version of ash
sweating and nasty looking
the reflection pulls ash close and speaks to him in an intimate whisper
i dont think were fine
were losing it
starting to slip
we just cut up our girlfriend with a chainsaw
does that sound fine
the reflection tightens its hold on ashs throat and begins to strangle him
two hands in the bottom of frame throttling him
camera races back to reveal ashs own hands on his throat
there is no sign of ashs evil reflection
ash has been strangling himself
he realizes this the same moment we do
he quickly pulls his hands away looks at them incredulously then to the mirror
his reflection is as it should be
he looks back down to his hands
the bite marks that lindas teeth have left in the hand stand out sharply
the wound suddenly blackens and spiderwebs its infection across the entire surface of the hand
the hand quivers and shakes now out of ashs control
the hand has taken a whitish cast
its veins throb and pulsate
it is possessed by the evil force
the hands fingernails grow inches
the wound oozes black fluid
ash is repulsed
ashs demon hand makes a lunge at his face which is countered by his good hand
he slams the hand to the cabin floor
he screams to the air you bastards
give me back my hand
wind and fog swirl about the place
ashs echoing scream is heard above the howling gale
give me back my hand
ash rushes into the kitchen and places his hand in the sink
he turns on the faucet
cool water runs over ashs burned hand
ash rests his head on the kitchen counter and mumbles reassurances to himself
cant be happening
as the water pours over it
it grabs a plate sitting in the dishwater and reaches up silently out of the sink
the plate is shattered over ashs head
the hand grabs ashs hair and mercilessly slams his head down upon the kitchen counter again and again
ash punches himself in the face and is sent reeling backwards
he smashes into a cupboard where dishes and plates fall upon him
the hand picks up plates and begins breaking them over ashs head
then a bottle
ash is knocked unconscious
the hand continues breaking objects over his head
ash lies unmoving but still alive
the hand stops as though it senses something
the camera pans to a large meat cleaver which lies upon the wooden floor
the hand as it independently crawls towards the meat cleaver
the hand is stopped when it runs out of arm now anchored by ashs unconscious body
it digs its nails deep into the floorboards and begins to pull
as he is pulled along the kitchen floor
as it pulls ashs unconscious body along after it
the hand clutches the meat cleaver when a large knife comes slicing through the demon hand pinning it to the floorboards
camera pulls over to reveal a revived ash
whos laughing now
he reaches over with his good hand and pulls a fire engine red chainsaw down from the shelf
he holds the body of the machine between his legs and with his good hand pulls the starter cord
the chainsaw roars to life
the camera tracks in to ashs sweating face
whos laughing now
he lowers the spinning blade of the chainsaw down out of frame and toward the evil hand
blood flies up into frame
we hear the buzzing of the chainsaw as it slices through bone and then falls silent
the camera cranes down as annies car approaches from the distance
it pulls to a halt
ed and annie step from the car
a red tow truck with its orange lights flashing is parked there
painted on its side is jakes gas n go
jake a toothless backwoods greasemonkey is setting up flares and wooden roadblocks
annie and ed approach
this the road to the knowbys cabin
but you aint goin there
and why not
as he reaches in his truck to pull on the headlights
as they snap on
all stand in the bright glare of the lights as the fog swirls about them
annie and ed gape in frightened wonder at what they see
the piercing beams of light illuminate twisted remnants of the destroyed bridge that leads to the cabin
a road sign similar to the one on the other side of the bridge reads dangerous bridge two ton weight limit
frightened as they view the wreckage
lady i aint never seen nothin like it
there must be another way in
another road or something
sure aint no road
camera pans over to reveal a brassy southern spitfire of a woman bobby joe
hell you wanna go there for anyway
bobby joe takes a pinch of chewing tobacco and stuffs it into her mouth
she doesnt like annie and her fancy clothes
she stares at annie like a cat
annie steps forward
she eyes bobby joe
none of your business
he feigns surprise and pleasantness
i just remembered
yeah thats right
there is a trail
you could follow bobby joe and me
that sounds all right
but itll cost ya
jake looks up suddenly at bobby joe who gives a sharp shake of her head
tell you what
you take my bags you got a deal
he glances through the window of annies car
the tiny case containing the missing pages of the book of the dead and a small handbag
looking back to annie a big smile on his near toothless face
a hiking trail winds through the woods
bobby joe leads the way with flashlight in hand
she pockets some bills
she is followed by annie and ed who carry the glass case containing the missing pages and the handbag
a grunting and sweating jake brings up the rear the large steamer trunk on his back
he is cursing under his breath
i thought she was talkin bout them two goddamn little pieces
the wind rushes fog about the place with a fury
a large moon hangs in the night sky
no longer attached to ashs arm it still writhes about beneath ashs foot which pins it to the floor
as he grabs the steel wastebasket dumps out the trash lowers it quickly over the camera trapping the hand within
with a note of finality ash slams down a pile of books atop the overturned wastecan to anchor it
the top books title reads farewell to arms
ash raises a red hot fireplace shovel that had been resting upon the coals
he grits his teeth
just out of frame ash thrusts the glowing shovel against the stump to cauterize the wound
red steam hisses up into frame as ash screams
he tosses aside the shovel and douses his smoldering stump into a vase of fresh flowers
unspooling a roll of duct tape
he tapes the tablecloth into a makeshift bandage about his wrist
behind him the wastebasket silently slides across the floor
he turns to see
upon its side
the evil hand is gone
he turns to a pitter patter sound
it scampers across the floorboards headed for a hole in the wall
same action as above but covered now through animation
low angle tracking shot approaching the hole in the wall
he raises the shotgun and fires
the floor next to the hand explodes
the hand leaps into the hole as a section of wall next to it explodes
ash quickly reloads both chambers of the gun
he tracks the sound of the pitter patter as the hand scampers through the sapace behind the wall like a rat
the blasted hole at the bottom of the wall
the hand appears still unhurt waving and taunting at ash
as it taunts ash it inadvertently sidesteps into a rusting mousetrap
it springs shut upon the hand
it screams furiously and shakes violently in an effort to get free the from trap
throws back his head in a gruff bark of laughter
the hand throws the trap from itself and raises its middle finger to ash flipping him the bird
he raises the gun revealing his face as the camera pans up with his movement
pointed directly at the hand
but the hand dodges away from the hole disappearing again behind the wall
the gun continues to track the evil hands progress through its pitter patter sound
the pitter patter ebbs and then peaks in volume
both triggers are squeezed
a nd and rd hole are blown in the wall
all is silent
as he lowers the smoking gun
wondering if he has hit the hand or not
all is silent for a moment and then a slight trickle of blood comes dripping from the hole and down the side of the wall
for the first time feeling victorious
as ash continues to stare at the hole his expression changes to one of perplexity
the trickle of blood has increased to a steady flow then even this volume of blood multiplies
it is forced out of the wall with a greater and greater pressure until blood pours from the wall like a fire hose
horrified he spins his glance to the sound of more gushing liquid
he is hit in the face with a geyser of deep red blood
the nd and rd holes in wall also begin to spew blood in a geyser
the camera pans over to the th of the holes
this too is an eruption of blood
the blood changes in color to a black fluid then yellow then turquoise
screaming as he looks down at his wrist
camera pans down to it
the severed wrist begins dribbling blood
then in a burst it too erupts in a hellish fire hose
it spouts blood under such great pressure that ash is driven against the walls of the cabin because of it
we follow him as he slams from one wall into another
in the midst of his scream drowning in the blood it all suddenly stops
the cabin is again deadly quiet
ash soaked in blood and shivering waits
for what hes not sure
as he slowly backs away from the walls and sits upon the three legged chair
it shatters beneath him dumping him on his butt
ash turns sharply to the low sound
the mounted moose head upon the wall
it is in a different position
it turns sharply towards ash and emits a hideous cackle
he pulls back in fear then turns to the sound of more laughter
the desk lamp on its steel swivel rises and falls in synchronization with its wheezing laughter
ah ha ha ha ha
ahhhh ha ha ha ha
terrified he turns to more laughter
a line of old books upon the shelf flap open and closed violently as they emit a chorus of sharp laughs
other books upon the floor laugh
he turns sharply toward us and breaks into an uproariously frightening bout of laughter
the wooden door behind ash comes to life
it stretches out as though it were elastic with each of its own low and terrible laughs
ash and everything in it are having the time of their lives
ash leads the bunch laughing harder and harder
the rooms laughter suddenly stops
ash instantly terrified grabs up the shotgun and fires into the door
pan to the front door
two holes are blown into the door
we hear a short shrill scream and then all is quiet
ash opens the front door
it slowly swings inward with a creak revealing the empty night
ash approaches the front porch as jake enters sharply into his frame
jake tackles ash
as it slides across the floor
ed enters and holds ash down as jake slugs him twice
ashs fist comes up into frame catching jake on the jaw
jake pulls back his fist and rockets a piledriver blow to ashs face knocking him senseless
annie and bobby joe enter
annie is taking off bobby joes coat
bobby joe is wounded from the shotgun blast
she holds her shoulder where the shell has grazed her
you gonna be alright honey
i dont know
you just sit still fer a minute
as jake gives ash a swift kick in the ribs
jake turns to ed who is badly shaken
you know this son of a bitch
we thought her annie steps forward
oh my god
where are my parents
annie sets down the glass case containing the pages of the book of the dead
as she looks down to the floor
as it lies in a pool of blood
annie runs to ashs semi conscious body grabs his shirt and violently shakes him
what the hell did you do to them
ed pulls annie off of ash
she drops ashs moaning head to the floor and backs away from him sobbing
nursing his sore knuckles he points with his elbow to the trap door that leads to the cellar
well throw him in there
jake picks up ashs body and drags him quickly to the trap door
half conscious ash feebly struggles with jake
crazy bucks gone blood simple
as he approaches the trap door almost upside down
ed pries it open
in a dazed state as he is carried to the trap door
damn right you flat mouthed son of a bitch
jake kicks ash down into the open trap door
looking up at the open trap door as ashs body falls through frame
as it slams into the wooden step
his feet tumble over him as he begins to fall down the staircase
as he tumbles head over heels down the wooden steps
racing down the steps
as he slams to the dirt floor of the cellar
jake ed and bobby joe
i hope you rot down there
ash begins to realize where he is
growing terror on his battered face
jake swings the trap door shut with a clanging of chains
the shaft of light from above disappears and he is encased in the darkness of the cellar
from above he hears the threading of chains through eyeloops
jake has just laid bobby joe down upon the couch
he dresses her wound with a towel
annie tosses down her coat on the chair at the writing desk
she spots the tape recorder and kandarian dagger
she moves to them
these are my fathers things
she turns on the tape recorder
high pitched feedback and the professors screams come from the speaker
voice on tape last night henrietta tried to kill me
voice on tape my fathers voice
i know now that my wife has become host to a kandarian demon
as they turn their heads to the sound of still playing the tapes wind as we hear the wowing and fluttering voice of raymond knowby
voice on tape i cannot bring myself to dismember my wife yet i know that i must to halt the evil that lives within her
as he lays in the center of the cellars earth floor
he strains his ears to listen to the tape playing in the room above
voice on tape it is october p
henrietta is dead
i could not bring myself to dismember her corpse
but i buried her
as he listens intently to the tape playing in the room above
camera slowly moving in on the winding tape
voice on tape i
in the cellar
growing horror on his face as he realizes where he is
voice on tape god help me i buried her in the earthen floor of the fruit cellar
ashs legs in the foreground
suddenly from the earthen floor of the fruit cellar a half rotten human head juts up
just the eyes are above the surface of the dirt
they dart about wildly and halt upon ash
worms crawl from the rotted forehead
henriettas arm rips through the earth and grabs ashs leg as he tries to back away
the corpse that was henrietta pulls itself from the grave and emits a wail
she turns her twisted body to face ash
moths fly about her in a flurry
someones in my fruit cellar
someone with a fresh soul
all eyes on the trap door
somebodys down there with him
he runs up the steps to the trap door and begins pounding furiously upon it
let me out
let me out
henrietta lets out a terrible laugh and approaches the wooden staircase
all eyes are on the banging trap door
ashs wild screams are coming from beneath
they look at one another not sure of what to do
jake holds the ring of keys
let him out
its a trick
i know it
at the top of the steps pounding on the trap door screaming to be let out
henrietta enters the frame at the bottom of the steps
a flutter of moths about her
henrietta begins to climb the steps
two at a time
come to me
come to sweet henrietta
as he tries one key after another
as they are forced into the lock
sweating at the top of the steps watching as henrietta approaches
extending her rotted and worm infested arm toward him
you and i
we shall spend eternity together
maries shadow envelops him
he is petrified
but first ill swallow your soul
with a sharp recoil then spring henrietta makes a lunge at ash
her face contorting her teeth lengthening her mouth opening impossibly wide as though she were going to swallow his head and all as she lunges forward
she changes to pee wee head
plate for previous scene
he screams as a set of bloody hands grab his face
but they are not henriettas
he is pulled upward to the main room of the cabin
it is jake who pulls ash to safety
jake finishes pulling ash up from the trapdoor and onto the floor of the main room
the horrible face of pee wee head henrietta pops from the cellar
screaming at the sight of the beast
for gods sake
thats my mother
one of henriettas rotted hands reach up from the cellar grabbing jake
as he moves to help jake henrietta swats at his jaw knocking him backward into a picture frame
he shatters it with his head and slumps to the floor
as he moves toward the trapdoor
ashs foot kicks the trapdoor shut and crushes henriettas pee wee head between the door and the floorboards
ash leaps down upon the trapdoor slamming it to pin pee wee head sideways
the pressure sends her left eyeball popping from her head like a cork from a champagne bottle
henriettas eyeball and trailing optic nerve mounted on glass panning with the eyeball as it sails through space
as the eyeball is shot into her screaming mouth
she begins to gag on it
jake kicks maries pee wee head in the face sending her back down into the cellar
the trap door shuts
ash leaps atop it
the sound of henrietta falling down the cellar steps is heard along with the beasts wild ravings
ash quickly threads the chains through the eyeloops
he snaps the lock shut
ash is shaking
jake slowly moves down into his frame
he is completely terrified
the tape recorder continues to play
voice on tape i fear that whatever i have resurrected from this book is sure to come calling for me
the camera takes the pov of the evil force as it glides through the woods
over a stump around the oak trees through a patch of fog as the cabin comes into view
ash turns to the group annie is placing her wet bandana atop eds forehead
theres something out there
witch in the cellar is only part of it
it lives out in those woods
in the dark
something thats come back from the dead
jake lets beat it the hell out ohere right now
i gotta get out
now bobby you aint in no condition
nobody goes out that door
not till daylight
they freeze in their tracks as they hear a gentle voice which sings a melancholy tune
annie turns her head to the sound and the camera pans to reveal henrietta whose head juts in the space between the floorboards and the trap door
she is no longer possessed
she looks as she did earlier in the film
she is singing a gentle song to annie
remember that song annie
i used to sing it to you when you were a baby
uncertain of what to do but wanting to believe
let me out dear
its so cold and dark in here
unlock these chains
annie starts to follow the instructions but ash halts her gently
he shakes his head
annie snaps out of it
she shakes her head and looks to the cellar
i dont know what you are but youre not my mother
annie begins to cry
henrietta is crying also
how can you say that to me annie
you were born september nd
i remember it well because it was snowing
so strange that it would be snowing in september
confused and tearful she screams to the others in the room
that thing in the cellar is not my mother
ed stands sharply into her frame
his eyes bone white his skin the pale color of the dead
his mouth has grown over large
his lips are black
he is possessed
annie screams and jumps back out of frame
he flies up into the air and writhes about as if he were a human marionette
he lets out a demonic moan and then begins to laugh
as they clutch in fear at one another
as they look on in horror
ash steps in front of annie as she gapes at this monstrosity that was ed
as he floats about the room
his laughter suddenly stops and a second demonic voice comes from his body
it is female and wailing in lament
watching in horror
the body of ed turns sharply toward the group not really seeing
in the voice of possessed we are the things that were
in the voice of possessed and shall be again
ha ha ha ha ha
in the voice of possessed spirits of the book
in the voice of possessed we want what is yours
as he floats about his head dips and swoons
in the voice of possessed dead by dawn
in the voice of possessed dead by dawn
sticking her gnarled head from the cellar
dead by dawn
dead by dawn
ed floating turns his head sharply to bobby joe
the possessed body of ed rushes through the air towards her
he opens his mouth wide open
as he quickly rushes upon a screaming bobby joe
he bites into bobby joes head
with a single motion he rips out the bulk of the hair from her head with a terrible riiiiiiiip sound
stands up into frame with a clump of bobby joes hair in his mouth and swallows it
bobby joe collapses to the ground
as she calls from the cellar
unlock these chains
he turns to the trap door and moves toward it
annie is shocked as she watches ash back into the middle bedroom and disappear
where are you going
you filthy coward
possessed ed moves toward the trap door
jake comes up quickly behind ed to grab his shoulder
as jakes hand reaches for the shoulder of possessed ed
the head of possessed ed spins around on its neck so that it faces jake
in the voice of a woman we see you
screaming as eds hand enters frame and snags jakes face
he tosses jake upward
as he tosses jake upward
jake flies upward towards the ceiling of the cabin
a prop light bulb shining in its fixture
jakes head comes flying up into frame shattering it and slamming into the wood ceiling and then falling back down again
as jake slams back down to the floor of the cabin
as he reappears in the doorway of the room
now he clutches an axe in his single hand
as he grabs the chains that secure the trap door ready to rip them loose
he turns his head to see ash approaches with the axe
ash exits the frame and we are left with annie and the stark shadow of possessed ed which is cast upon the wall behind her
we watch as the shadow of ash with the axe slices through the top portion of possessed eds head
annie screams as she is splattered with green bile
missing eds right hand portion of his head
his brain shriveled like the inside of a pumpkin
ash stands before us his axe dripping green bile
eds arms flail wildly on either side of the camera groping at the air
he slowly falls over and slams to the floor
eds body falls to the floor
it lays quiet for a moment and then begins to writhe and scream in its demonic death throes
finally he is silent
ash turns to her
start up that saw and hand it here
were gonna cut him up
annie looks to the chainsaw and then to the unmoving body of ed
she is repulsed at the thought
possessed ed stands up quickly into frame
the evil force having re animated his lifeless body
as a hand grabs ashs throat
possessed ed exits frame revealing it to be ashs evil hand on his own throat
it lifts him into the air
as they are lifted off the floor
he pries the evil hand from his throat and falls
as he slams to the floor the evil hand scurries away in the b
annie is screaming in horror
possessed ed backhands her across the face
annie slams into a desk shattering it to splinters of wood
she falls to the floor
as he grabs the axe
as he stands sharply into frame
his mouth wide open and screaming
terrified as he moves toward possessed ed with the axe
ash brings the axe down upon eds shoulder knocking him to the floor
ash swings the axe again and again
different colors of bile and blood fly up into frame as ash chops
screaming at the sight
his axe blade rises and falls as black demon blood flies up into frame
eds missing portion of his head sits upon the floor
his eye in extreme c
in the foreground
it looks wildly about into the camera
in the background we watch ash bring down the axe until all is silent
jake slowly stands into the empty frame
he is in shock from what he has just seen
annie slowly rises into frame shaking her head in a silent no
ash slowly rises into frame terrified
they are looking down at the out of frame remains of possessed ed
the moon has grown larger
fog billows past the cabin
jake sprays a can of air freshener about the room
he holds his nose
ash tosses a bloodied sheet containing the remains of possessed ed to the floor
it lands with a sickening thud
wiping his face with a rag ash moves off in disgust
we hold on the bundled sheet as the trap door next to it silently opens
henriettas rotted hand emerges unnoticed by the others in the room
jake i cant take no more of this
henriettas rotted hand pulls the bundle of body parts silently down into the cellar and quietly closes the trap
jake moves to the window and looks out
that trail we came in here on
well it just aint there no more
like the woods jus swallowed it
the room goes quiet
the sound of the wind outside the cabin has died
jake and bobby joe cock their heads to this new silence
she looks about the room getting scared
its so quiet
ash stands slowly into frame
he knows that it cant be good
as they raise their heads to a distant pounding sound
it grows louder
what the hell is it
something trying to force its way into our world
the cabin wall
bobby joe runs to jakes arms
he clutches her tightly
annie runs to ash
he holds her
the pounding sounds halt
again they are left in silence
annie awkwardly disengages herself from ash
they hear a sound coming from the middle bedroom
its in there
it is opened a crack
well all go in together
hell no youre the curious one
he moves toward the door
ill go with you
ash nods to annie in a show of thanks
he grabs the axe and pushes open the door to the middle bedroom
annie follows with the flickering oil lantern
the door to the main room creaks open
ash and annie cautiously enter
they look about the place
as the camera pans the shadowed corners of the room
an eerie whistling wind is heard
it has an other worldly sound very far off
bobby joe and jake enter the room drawn by the sound
she looks about frightened
jake takes bobby joes hand
bobby joe smiles frightened
as the eerie whistling sound grows louder
it is followed by the angry sound of something moving violently about the room
a shattering of glass
the group is hit with a tremendous blast of air
they shiver from the cold
the wind in the room suddenly stops
he blows out his breath and watches it vaporize
the screaming face of raymond knowby emerges from the wall
a life like spirit made of swirling smoke and mist
they turn to the ghost in fear
bobby joe crosses herself
holy mother omercy
there is a dark spirit here that wants to destroy you
your salvation lies in the pages from the book of the dead
the ghost of raymond points to annies glass case
camera pans to it
inside are the pages from the book
recite the passages
dispel the evil
save my soul
and your own lives
the ghost of raymond screams and is gone
again they are hit with a blast of air
jake you squeezing my hand too tight
i aint got your hand baby
bobby joe raises her hand into frame to reveal ashs evil hand clutched in hers
bobby joe goes nuts screaming and flailing about trying to throw the hand from her
she slams into the lantern knocking it out
we lose them in the darkness
somebody get the light
the sound of chairs being pushed over
the sound of a door opening and closing
as he lights the lantern illuminating the room
camera pans over to reveal only jake and annie
bobby joes gone
screaming bobby joe makes a mad dash away from the cabin
it diminishes in size behind her she has had enough of it
as she races through the woods
she runs deep into the woods still looking behind her as she slams into a twisted oak tree that stops her flat
an angry face appears on the surface of the tree
its gnarled bark folds open to reveal very human like oversized eyes
a large fold in its bark opens to form a gaping mouth dripping tree sap saliva
screaming as she backs away from this living tree as a flurry of snake like vines pick themselves up off of the ground and come to life about her
two living vines wind their way toward her legs and coil around her ankles tightly
she lets out a short shrill scream as her shirt is torn away from her
living vines wind around bobby joes torso and breasts in a furious wrapping motion
a living vine wraps around her throat
tiny vines wrap around bobby joes hand and fingers
bobby joe wrapped in vines is reeled backwards and ripped through a wall of branches
at a great speed bobby joe is pulled away from the cabin and towards the forest by the vines
as the vines rocket her on a speeding fast motion joyride along the forest floor
as she drags along the forest flctor the smaller vines force their way into bobby joes nose and mouth and then under the first layer of her facial skin
she is pulled along the ground and down into a foxhole dummy
camera continues tracking along her original trajectory until we come to the second foxhole where she emerges now covered in mud and screaming
bobby joe rips through spikes extending from a log and is dragged through two mud puddles
the vines wisk her away
she hits a swamp with a giant splash but even this does not stop her
she glides across the surface of the swamp with a great roostertail spray of water as if she were on water skis
she hits the other side of the swamp and is rocketed out of the water and across the forest floor
bobby joe comes roaring towards us screaming
she rips past
from behind camera bobby joe appears and goes racing into the distance
darting in and around trees a major stump is coming right for her
bobby joes legs spread wide
the tree stump races closer
bobby joe screams
girl meets stump
we hear the rip
and watch as a geyser of blood floods up into the night sky
it falls away from the camera and shatters on the table beneath us
as their hands scramble at removing the pages from the bits of broken glass
jake is looking out the boarded window of the cabin searching for some sign of bobby joe
all is silent as fog rushes in and around the woods
where the hell is she
jake turns to ash
we gotta go out there and find her
if she went out in those woods shes not coming back
jake turns back to the window
ash turns to annie
he glances down at the pages that annie is looking over
one of the pages is a clear pictorial of ash as the hero from the sky
what is it
felt like someone just walked over my grave
its that picture
annie looks to it
this was the hero from the sky who was prophesized to destroy this evil
he didnt do a very good job
what about the passages
as she quickly gives the pages a cursory glance
here it is
for the first time she smiles at ash
weve got it
finally seeing his salvation his face shows hope
annie reads through the pages
recitation of the first passage will make this dark spirit manifest itself in the flesh
why the hell would we want to do that
annie thumbs through one or two of the other pages
recitation of the second passage creates a kind of rift in time and space and the physical manifestation of this spirit can be forced back through this rift
to an earlier time and place
at least thats the best translation i can
annie and ash look up to the source of the sound
he has just snapped a shell into the firing chamber of the shotgun
he points it at ash and annie
im runnin the show now
standing together confused
were goin outside into those woods to look for bobby joe an once we find her were gettin the hell outta here
if you want to look for her go ahead
you two comin with me
i aint goin out there alone
no you idiot
youll kill us all
shes dead by now
with these pages we can
jake grabs the pages from annies hand
those pages dont mean shit
jake kicks the pages down into the cellar
ash and annie look on in horror
now you aint got no choice
jake pushes at ash with the barrel of the shotgun
move you son of a bitch
ash annie and jake exit the cabin
ash annie and jake walk towards the woods
in the fg is ash
he looks off past the camera in fear
as he approaches a line of trees whose branches bend and sway with a threatening motion
which way do you intend to go
looking confused and frightened
he calls out desperately
as it glides through the woods
we hear a muted shout from jake
bobby joe where are you girl
and the pov of the force suddenly swings about to reveal jake ash and annie not to far away
as he moves deeper into the woods
as she searches the woods with her eyes in fear
as scared as the rest of them but driven to find bobby joe
as it approaches the group
ash approaches jake
youll get us all killed
jake slams ash across the face with the stock of the shotgun
ash plummets to the ground
she goes after jake
jake slugs her and she falls to the ground
it draws closer
raging to the night
pov of evil force racing up to the group
jake halts his screaming
he listens in the silence as possessed ash juts up into the frame
his eyes are bone white his flesh the pale color of the dead
his lips black
he bellows to the night
she screams and stumbles backwards towards the cabin
possessed ash lifts jake up above his head and throws him into a large tree
it explodes in a blast of sawdust as the dummy slams into it
annie dashes inside and turns to look out the open doorway
all is quiet outside no sign of possessed ash or jake and then possessed ash is there emerging from the darkness suddenly
he raises his finger and points to annie
he speaks in the low garbled voice of a demon she rushes to the door hoping to get there before possessed ash
she slams the front door shut just in time
she picks up the kandarian dagger
a sound coming from somewhere in the rear of the cabin
she turns toward the door to the hallway
it is closed
she moves to investigate the sound
as she approaches the rear door to the hall and slowly opens it
as the door to the hallway is pulled open revealing only the empty hallway
she breathes a sigh of relief
as she moves down the hall
it is dark
curtains flutter on the boarded windows
as she moves towards the rear of the cabin
we approach the window and look out into the night
fog billows through the trees and in the distance the monster that is ash emerges
he heads toward the cabin and disappears in a bank of fog
annie is frightened
she spins her head to a sound
the doorknob is turning
something is trying to get in
she forces her back to the wall
she tenses with the dagger ready to slay whatever should enter
gripped tightly in annies sweating hands
rattling violently now
and suddenly it opens
as they swing the dagger
as the dagger imbeds in the intruders chest
camera pans up quickly to reveal a gasping jake
jake falls to the ground half in and out of the doorway
he is still alive
as she backs away in horror clutching at her head
she backs to a partially boarded window
possessed ash juts up into frame in the window behind her
annie screams and runs toward the open back door
possessed ash spots the open door through the window and begins to move around the side of the house
as she goes to slam the door
as he lies moaning in the doorway the door slams upon him
as she reaches down and pulls jakes body out of the way
as he moves around the side of the cabin tearing apart a trellis that stands in his path and three hanging flowerpots as he approaches the open door
again she tries to slam the door
which lies in the doors path preventing it from closing
as he approaches the back door
he grabs the screen door and tears it loose with a single motion
as she pulls jakes ankle from the door and slams it
all is again silent
annie kneels down next to a moaning jake driving the dagger in a little deeper by accident
he cries out in pain
get the axe
jake moans and dies
as she turns her head to the sound of breaking glass
as she cautiously approaches the main room
as she moves towards the main room
annie enters the room
she shudders from the cold
camera pans with her glance to broken glass upon the floor and over to reveal the bashed out window and the curtains fluttering in the wind
knowing that the monster ash may be lurking close
as she moves about the main room picking up the axe
with her back toward us she doesnt notice ashs hand appear suddenly in the foreground atop the writing desk
she turns suddenly towards camera
ashs evil hand sits upon the table
it scampers off
annie turns and comes face to face with possessed ash
he bellows at her and grabs her as she shrieks bloody murder
he picks her up and swings her across the room into the wall
she slumps to the floor unconscious
as he lumbers toward her
as he moves closer to her unmoving body
a glitter of light on the floor next to her catches his eye
for the first time calm as he looks intently down at the floor
he kneels closer
the necklace of linda
the sight of the necklace strikes the human cord within him
he is confused his evil self battling for control of his spirit and body
he reaches to pick it up
as he slowly picks up the delicate silver necklace
he raises it to his face ill never take it off
and then it hits him
the emotion of love lost
it floods the monster that is ash
he clutches the necklace tightly to his bestial chest
and as the love waltz theme sweeps up in volume on the sound track the monster begins to cry
ash raises his head and lets out a low lamenting and pitiful wail
a man trapped in the shell of a beast crying for the one he has lost
as he raises his head
tears stream down from his eyes washing away the caked on blood
his face begins to change
his skin loses its white pallor
his blackened infected cuts disappear
the swollen and cracked surface of his face begins to heal
ashs eyes change from white to brown
as the last tears roll down ashs face he is once again human
ash looks up suddenly with a start
as he rolls out of the way a moment before the head of the axe buries itself in the wooden floor
rolls to his feet and stands
he ducks as annie enters frame charging him with axe screaming
annie swings the axe and again ash ducks
the head of the axe slams into the plastered wall smashing right through
ash grabs her tightly with his remaining hand
listen to me
im all right now
that thing is gone
ash pushes her away
annie falls to the floor
catching his wind for a moment
then rolls to the side as the axe again comes at him
the head of the axe slices into the wall only a few inches from his head
as he grabs annie by the face and forces her backwards
god damn it
i said i was all right
annie is nearly choking
ash releases her gently
she again looks to ash cautiously
are you sure
youll be the first to know
yeah but for how long
if were going to beat this thing we need those pages
as he turns to the trap door
then lets head down into that cellar
it lies silently against the floor
a rasping breath can be heard from below
he turns from the trap door to annie
and carve ourselves a witch
ashs hand flips open the latch on the shed door
the door is kicked open revealing the silhouette of ash and annie as they stand in the doorway
rats scurry for safety as the shaft of light from the door hits them
ashs hand pulls on the cord turning on the light
ashs arm sweeping the chains and pieces of wood onto the floor
is tossed down upon the workshed table
is tossed down next to the first
hold down a clamp as ashs hand creates screw sized holes in it with a battery powered drill
attach the hoseclamps to a piece of red steel
attach the red piece of steel to ashs stump via the clamps
attach a v type hook around ashs neck just above his bicep
slams down the chainsaw upon the table
it is missing its side panel
ashs arm enters frame and we see that it is this missing side panel that has been clamped to his stump
the panel slides into the side of the chainsaw with a sharp click
as he bends the chainsaw to his chest
the t shaped end of the starter cord falls neatly into the v shaped hook that is strapped around ashs neck
he looks up to annie the moment of truth
hair tousled over her sweating face returns his glance expectant
ash extends his chainsaw arm pulling on the starter cord
the chainsaw roars to life
with his free arm ash raises the shotgun
he lowers the blade of the chainsaw down upon the barrel
sparks fly as the saw cuts through it
the long barrel falls to the floor
ash is left with a sawed off shotgun in one hand and a chainsaw strapped to his other arm
with a fancy style western flip to the gun ash saddles the shotgun in a makeshift holster strapped to his back
the camera slowly tracks into ashs face
in the distance the tiny figures of ash and annie as they move from the workshed to the cabin
in the foreground is a large oak tree
a gnarled human like face can be made out on the surface of the tree
it is lit from beneath and slolwly brought up on a dimmer
a horrible twisted tree face
it suddenly opens its mouth and breathes in a gust of air with a terrible wheezing sound as though in great pain at being brought to life
it turns sharply towards the cabin
second tree face brought up on a dimmer opens its mouth and loudly draws in air also in agony
a third trees twisted face two human eyes opened wide on its surface
it breathes then barks a guttural sound
in the foreground is the base of a large oak tree
the cabin in the distance
a rumbling is heard
then suddenly the tree pulls one of its massive roots from the earth
the tree sets its root down a few feet closer to the cabin
an entire line of trees
all pull their roots free from the soil and take an awkward and lumbering step towards the cabin
begins cutting through the wood of the trap door
tensing with her axe ready for the beast to spring
as it completes the second cut in the wood of the trap door
as he finishes the slicing job and kicks open the trap door
the broken bits of the trap door fall past the camera as they cautiously peer down into the cellar
looking down into the cellar
no sign of henrietta
the bottom of the steps disappear into blackness
those pages are down there somewhere
he kicks aside the broken trapdoor and slowly descends into the darkness
ash arrives at the bottom of the steps
he looks about the dark corners of the cellar trying to find some sign of henrietta or the pages
panning the cobwebs and dark stone walls of the cellar
half hidden in the shadows we see two of the missing pages
as he moves through the cellar and grabs the pages
he spots another page somewhat deeper into the cellar
a fourth and fifth page lay upon the earthen floor at the base of the cellars rear door
ash moves to pages and gathers them
annies voice calls down
did you find her
shes playing hard to get
he pumps the throttle on the buzzing saw
behind ash unseen by him a shadow darts by
he hears a sound
it is coming from the door to the cellars rear room
he reaches for the door and opens it
revealing darkness beyond
again he hears the slight sound a gentle ticking
the ticking sound is coming from behind a hanging drape
he approaches the drape reaches out his hand and pulls it back sharply
revealing an old water heater ticking and steaming
he breathes a sigh of relief as the half eaten skeleton torso of ed falls atop him
ash screams and steps suddenly away
eds skeletal carcass falls to the earthen floor still wrapped in the bloody sheet
looking on in horror
in a whisper she got hungry
ash turns from the skeleton and quickly gathers up the remaining pages from the book of the dead
getting scared now he backs into the cellars front room
as he moves towards the steps
he tosses up the bundle of pages
peering down into the cellar she grabs the pages
she rushes over to the writing desk and begins translating
getting scared now decides to exit the cellar
he climbs the steps
as they climb
from behind the wooden steps the horrible head of henrietta appears
her two rotting hands grab at ashs ankles
he looks down with a scream
come to me
come to sweet henrietta her face pulls back behind the cellar steps
her hands pull ashs feet in after her
as ash falls he slams his jaw down upon the bottom step
as the spinning blade jams into the step stalling the engine
in an instant his entire body is pulled beneath the steps
as she sits at the writing desk reciting the first of the passages
nos feratos allo memnon kanda
she puts aside the pages and glances up suddenly at the faint sounds of the struggle from the cellar
ashs badly mauled body rips through the staircase with a great force
as he slams into the earth floor of the cellar
he moans and looks towards the steps
as a cackling henrietta appears where the bottom section of staircase used to stand
as she races from the writing desk to look down into the cellar
as she kneels down at the trapdoor about to call down to ash when the witchlike figure of henrietta floats quickly up into the main room from the cellar
a flurry of moths about her
free at last
as annie attempts to move from the trap door
henrietta is clutching at annies hair and laughing with a demonic malice as she spins about the room in mid air
ashs bloodied arm slings itself over the edge of the trapdoor
he pulls himself up into the main room
henrietta turns sharply to ash with a growl
he stands and jerks out his chainsaw arm sharply
the cord is pulled and the engine roars to life
as she leaps through the air toward ash
ash swings his buzzing chainsaw
as it grabs the body of the chainsaw halting it in mid swing
as she keeps the buzzing chainsaw at bay with one hand while her other grabs at ashs throat strangling him
as he is slammed through the window
ash kicks her in the stomach
henrietta is furious
she grits her teeth concentrates and her neck begins to grow
she begins to change to pee wee head
camera pans up on b wall
as the pee wee head transformation continues henriettas neck grows like a jack in the box
it extends a solid five feet upward so that her head is now looking down upon ash baring its teeth
ash gapes in fear at this monstrosity that looms above him
her neck undulating like a snake she bites and snaps
ill swallow your soul swallow your soul
henrietta swoops at ash as he keeps her at bay with the buzzing chainsaw
she opens her mouth impossibly wide exposing those nasty rows of jagged shark like teeth
she dive bombs him
plate for previous scene
as her head springs down into frame and halts suddenly inches from his face
in the silence we hear the reason annies voice singing the same melody that her mother had sung to her earlier from the cellar
for a moment henriettas face loses its evil malice
she is confused at this sound
she spins her head toward annie
as she finishes the melancholy song
still confused suddenly she shrieks and the chainsaw comes buzzing through her from behind
the spinning blade juts out from henriettas midsection
body parts arms fly past the camera on wire
ash slices and dices
henrietta screeches like a wild banshee
as pee wee head spins toward ash furious
swallow your soul
swings his chainsaw arm in a sharp arc
henriettas head is sliced from her neck with a chainsaw
steam pours from her neck
as it flies up into frame sliced from its neck
as he completes the arc of the chainsaw
as it hits the floor
its neck spouts steam wagging about like a snake
behind her annie watches as the body topples to the floor
he looks down
swallow your soul
swallow your soul
ashs foot steps down upon her head pinning it to the floor
her neck still writhing
he unsaddles his sawed off shotgun from the holster on his back
he points the barrel at her head point blank
he pulls the trigger
flame barks from the gun
her head explodes into a million pieces
annie is crying
ash holsters the gun
may she rest in pieces
as they look at each other for a quiet moment of relief
ash shuts off the chainsaw
annie moves slowly to ashs arms
he holds her
they pull apart and look into each others eyes
annie holds the pages
maybe they can get away after all
a loud booming echoes throughout the cabin
as though the outside walls of the place were being bombarded by cannon balls
the kitchen wall behind them buckles
as the b board of the wall behind ash falls away revealing battered logs
the mirror shatters
the wall cracks beneath the terrific force of whatever is outside hammering upon it
camera tracks in on them as they look about in fear
dust is falling about them
the cabin walls are starting to break apart
there is a tremendous voyage to the bottom of the sea type jolt to the cabin
ash and annie stagger for footing
ash grabs ahold of the window frame to brace himself
vines wrap about the planks which cover the window
behind him the planks in the window are ripped away by finger like vines
a terrifying tree face on the surface of a giant oak is revealed as it peeks in through the window at them
she turns toward d wall at a loud wrenching sound
as vines reach in the cabin tearing away the planks revealing an even more horrible tree face
a tree beats its branches furiously upon the ext
wall of the cabin
it rips apart the cabins stone chimney
a second gnarled tree slams its trunk against the rear door of the cabin
the entire cabin is surrounded by a group of lumbering oaks
all working to get in at ash and annie
annie runs to the writing desk
she flips through the missing pages from the book of the dead
dust from the ceiling drifts down
shouting above the noise no
i only completed the first of the passages
and that was to make the evil a thing of the flesh
as it roars out of the woods and towards the distant cabin faster than weve ever seen it
as he runs over to annie
you didnt finish it
theres still the second passage
the one to open the rift and send the evil back
start reciting it
now as it rockets towards the cabin doing mph
shouting to be heard as she continues reading from the passage tar tra kanda estra
hudsucker proxy kanda
the forest at night
bubbling smoke appears then flame
through the smoke the beginnings of a winding spiral of a cloudlike material
aton neran ofas
as it races right up to the front door of the cabin
reading from the passage
behind her the front door rips open and in comes a giant rotten apple head of the evil entity made flesh
a shrieking bulbous behemoth
ash as he witnesses the most horrible sights a man can behold
ashs black hair streaks white before our eyes
behind him two flowers in their pots wither and die in seconds
plate for previous scene with dying flowers
samonda roba areda gyes indy en zeen nos feratos annie as she gasps
annie as she falls to the floor dead
jutting from her back is the kandarian dagger and hanging onto the end of the dagger is ashs demon hand
behind ash a living tree branch rips through the cabin window
ash turns suddenly to get away
the living branch wraps about ashs waist and lifts him screaming out of frame
ash is being lifted toward the gaping mouth of rotten apple head
ash is frantically jerking out his arm in an attempt to start the chainsaw strapped to his wrist
it wont start
as the face of rotten apple head looms close it opens its terrible mouth ready to consume him
from inside the creatures mouth looking out
ash is screaming as he is brought towards its gnashing teeth
putt putt putt
his chainsaw still wont start
half dead as she crawls to the pages on the floor and gasps out the final sentences
nos feratos amen non
the rift grows more powerful
sweating and terrified
he draws closer
the camera tracks in toward the mouth of rotten apple head
its massive jaw jutts from the head biting and snapping
sap like saliva drips from the orifice
ashs feet kick at the mouth of rotten apple head trying to keep it away
its jaws snap at his shoes
the massive teeth snap together biting ashs foot in half
he screams then looks down to his foot
missing the leather toe section he reveals that he still has his toes intact
as he sharply jerks his arm outward
the chainsaw roars to life
he raises it high above his head and plunges it forward
ash thrusts the spinning chainsaw blade into the single eye of the beast
as it punctures the giant eyeball and then pulls free
green sauce spouts from the creatures wound
as he is doused in the green bile
eyeless it screams in anger
with her last gasp
as the rift pulls in fog and trees that surround the house
as rotten apple head is sucked out the doorway of the cabin
the door slams shut behind it
its scream echoes off into the distance
slices through the bracch
ash and cut branch fall to the floor
the cabin becomes much more quiet
the sounds of the trees are gone
ash looks to annie
she is dead
ash moves to her strokes her hair and begins to cry
you did it
by god you did it
he lowers his head and begins to heave in sharp convulsive breaths of despair
behind ash the front door rips open with a tremendous blast
the door is sucked down into the rift
all of the objects in the room are sucked through the open doorway and down into the rift including the pages of the book of the dead
ash grabs ahold of the kitchen window ledge so as not to be swept outside by the force of the vacuum of the rift
objects and papers fly past him
upon the kitchen window ledge
the ledge tears free
as he screams flying backward towards the open door
the open doorway to the cabin
ash flies towards it and is snagged from going through by the section of ledge that he holds
his body is horizontal his feet dangling in air in the direction of the rift
ash as he hangs on for dear life
objects continue to fly past on wires
for gods sake how do you stop it
the nails in the section of ledge that ash holds tear loose and the ledge snaps in two
he spins wildly away from us and towards the rift
ash is rocketed through the air spinning somersaults
ash is sucked down into the swirling rift
like a particle that is swallowed by a deep funnel of draining water
the rift closed behind him
plate for previous scene
we are now within the vortex a swirling mass of colors and clouds
and nightmarish sound effects
objects come at us from the distance and roar past an uprooted tree the grandfather clock with its hands winding backwards at an incredible rate ash spinning at us hand
over foot screaming
the chainsaw still mounted to his wrist
the vortex is distorting ashs features as he is rocketed back through the dark void of time
a wild and rapid pictorial collage of human history winding back from the present through the centuries lasting seven seconds
a hole opens in the air with a sharp crackling sound
ash is spat from this hole and falls downward through frame
plunged to the dust
debris from the demolished cabin rains down around him his shotgun the delta oldsmobile and the old grandfather clock
as it seals shut leaving only the blue sky and the sound of tweeting birds
ashs view of the serene sky changes abruptly as five steel helmets jut into his line of sight
five armor clad medieval warriors stand directly over him
as he looks to the warriors above him
the first warrior raises a bloodstained longsword and poises it above ashs head
slay the beast
tis a deadite
all raise their swords ready for the kill
halt as they hear a piercing high pitched screech
they turn their heads skyward
follows the warriors gaze
a winged deadite a female harpy like creature with the tail of a sea horse and man sized bat wings enabling it to fly
the screaming beast swoops down towards the warriors and horses
high above the distant shapes of other winged deadites circle
she lets out a screaming banshee laugh while swooping down
as we swoop down toward the warriors and ash
as he springs to his feet
with a lightning thrust he reaches behind him
as he grabs at the gun from its holster
he swings it around front and pulls the trigger
it discharges flame
the beast continues to flap its wings and fly about a moment before falling to a heap in the dust
as he looks to ash
they follow his gaze
the camera pans to ash
he stands alone on a small pile of rubble clutching his smoldering shotgun
he looks about dazedly
he tries to get his bearings
unsure of how to react to this strange man who a moment before was pronounced a deadite
from the crowd the warrior calls out hail he who has come from the sky to deliver us from the terrors of the deadites
the cry is taken up by all
a line of medieval warriors bow
all remove their helmets and kneel silently in the dust
somewhere in the distance a drum sounds
ash stands frozen
terrified unsure of where or when he is
knowing only for the present he is alive
as the wind kicks up blowing dust ash strikes a familiar pose
it is the same image of the hero from the sky that we saw earlier in the film
the strange jagged edged longsword is ashs chainsaw
the camera pulls back from him as a great medieval castle rears up into frame
it is seen to be the castle of kandar
the same castle we saw in the beginning of the film
now however the castle is not a ruin but brand new
