href b b written by rob hedden a dark rumbling sky
haze clings to the lake as we float across it clearing to bring the opposite shoreline into view
a few scattered streetlights
an abandoned campsite
camp crystal lake
we continue to drift towards it hearing the faint sound of seductive music and an occasional giggle
a small houseboat floats into our foreground its interior light flickering as two bodies move around inside
a teenage boy and girl jim and suzy are slow dancing
jims lips softly touch her lissome shoulders
how do you feel
ask me in about five minutes
she bites his ear giggles then kisses him fully
im talking about graduation
being totally free to do whatever we want now
her hands slip inside his pendleton shirt
it feels excellent
her mouth finds his again
after a long kiss he gently pulls away from her with a teasing smile
gotta throw the anchor over
he leaves the cabin
she slips under the bed sheets
as jim tosses a small anchor overboard
as the weighty object splashes sinking into black oblivion pulling its cable down with it
glances at the lake at their eerie surroundings
he feels a chill heading back inside
as the anchor drifts to the lake bottom dropping a few feet from a thick power cable which rests in the lake silt
as jim returns with an uneasy expression
he crawls on top of the bed kissing her again but not with the same enthusiasm as before
he starts to pull off his shirt and join her
she senses his anxiety
somethings bothering you
jim pauses turning off the mood music
its just that were right around that old summer camp where all those murders took place
the boat creaks
shes instantly nervous
never mind you dont want to know about it
theres nothing to worry about suzy
the guys dead now somewhere at the bottom of this lake
if you believe the stories
beat lets drop it okay
he starts to kiss her again
she stops him
he doesnt want to go into it but suzys face insists
there was this boy named jason voorhees who drowned in crystal lake
eight year old jason is desperately trying to tread water flailing his arms like a marionette to get attention as he gulps down gallons of mossy lake water
none of the counselors heard him
and jason finally slips under the surface for good
a bunch of years went by and everybody forgot about it
beat thats when the murders started
as our senses are bombarded with quick cuts of assorted teenagers just about to die their screams echoing over each other
we do not see the attacker
as the cacophony reaches a screeching crescendo cut back to as the silence hits us hard again
jason did it
thats what some people thought
but they were wrong
voorhees comes directly at camera wielding a huge knife and a primal scream
his mother blamed the counselors for his death and tried to kill them all
dramatic pause she got her head chopped off by one of them
we dont need to see this clip
suzys reaction is quite sufficient
so the murders stopped
he gives her a long penetrating look
were bombarded with quick flashes of a hockey masked jason wreaking havoc on assorted teenagers
brandishing everything from hatchets to knives to chainsaws
just as jason is about to stab us cut back to suzy flinches as if she were getting the knife
legend has it that jason came back to avenge his mothers death vowing to kill every teenager from the area
beat and every now and then the murders start up again
the boat lurches slightly tugging at the anchor cable
shes scared hes frightened himself a little too
forget about it suzy
theyre just stories
he brushes her hair back kissing her cheek gently finding the nape of her neck again
she closes her eyes trying to dismiss what hes dredged up
but she cant
suzy begins to rationalize
were the last graduating class right
jims kissing her body putting jason behind him
i mean lakeview high just closed its doors for good right
so theres no reason for him to come back because there wont be any of us around
jim stops looking her squarely in the eyes
except that jason isnt real so none of it matters anyway
she starts to relax returning his kisses
as the anchor drifts along the lake floor tugging hard on the power cable
camera tracks along the cable coming to a rusty set of chains tangled around it
as jim slides on top of suzy
thoughts of jason are starting to slip away along with their clothes
as the chains emit a dull tinkle due to movement from the tugging anchor
camera continues to track again
and we find to our horror that the waterlogged fish eaten body of jason is secured by these same chains
note jasons face is obscured
teenagers in love lost in not so innocent passion
at the same moment the anchor tugs one last time and rips through the cable
sparks instantly fly chasing along the cable finding the chain which secures jason and engulfing him in as bright flashes of blue light strobe under the surface
arcing current chases up the anchor cable sparking across the hoist
as the electricity feeding the streetlights is abruptly extinguished plunging the campsite into darkness
as suzys eyes flash open
did you hear that
he pulls her back down
cmon im serious
he knows the mood is broken
all right ill check it out
he slips on his jeans exiting the cabin
she pulls the sheet up around her fearfully
as the cable smolders void of electricity now
track to find the chains again
but theyre dangling loosely
suzy is tensely kneeling on the bed now
the black void of night is all she sees out the cabin door which jim has left open
an uncomfortable amount of time passes
her heart starts to pound
she wraps herself in the sheet moving towards the open door
the ship creaks again
as she grows closer to the doorway nothing but pitch black beyond it
stop screwing around jim
i mean it
and just as she reaches the door leaps out clutching a huge knife
suzy barely has time to scream before jason plunges the knife into her chest
stands there in speechless shock looking down at her mortal wound
but theres no blood
pulls the knife back out pushing the blade in and out with his hand
its a retractable rubber knife
jim pulls off the hockey mask with a huge grin tossing it aside
gotcha good baby cakes
she doesnt know whether to hug him with relief or kick him in the balls
he pulls her back onto the bed laughing
sitting dormant on the deck where jim tossed it
a shadow falls across it
followed by a slimy decomposing hand
the hand grabs it like its an old friend pulling it away
as jim holds his angry girlfriend down on the bed trying unsuccessfully to kiss her
all right all right im a major ass
and youll never do it again
and ill never do it again
shes resisting only for effect
her legs curl around him finally giving in
a deadly sharp spear gun rests in its rack outside the cabin
jasons hand removes it
the sheets begin to roll like waves as they work each other
thoughts of jason are nonexistent now
nothing there for a moment
then a pair of moss covered closes her eyes with pleasure
and camera rises from the mossy feet up the bloodless legs and torso to ultimately reveal the hockey masked face of our anti hero jason voorhees
lets out a broad smile her eyelids fluttering
they stay open long enough to regard the visitor in the doorway
she tries to choke out a warning to jim whos just collapsed himself
he doesnt follow her glance smiling instead
you must really think im an ass
but she continues to stare in horror as raises the spear taking aim
hs starts to kiss her but she bolts up with a blood curdling scream
a second later jason fires the spear jim stares point blank at his dead girlfriend not able to assimilate it quickly enough
he spins around to see the monster himself
jim springs off the bed looking around for anything to defend himself with grabbing the bedside lamp
he smashes it over jasons head which has little effect
jim scrambles to get past him but jason lifts jim in the as the houseboat silently drifts onward
the lone silhouette of jason emerges from within taking the helm
only the faintest sign of daylight can be seen through a thick blanket of gray fog
in the distance speckled lights outlining a smaller luxury cruise ship intermittently appear
standing at the boarding ramp is charles mcculloch clipboard in hand
hes just finished checking off a pair of new agey senior girls
mcculloch is approaching fifty wearing a tie and unwrinkled clothes as well as the disposition of a stern puritan
remember girls the shuffleboard tournament will start at six p
a non attendance will restrict your time in port understood
they nod for his benefit exchanging derogatory whispers as they head up the ramp
camera adjusts to find a small parking lot adjacent to the docks where several cars are just now arriving parents dropping off their high school seniors hugging them bon voyage
as sean robertson walks toward the ship with pal miles wolfe
seans a tall nice looking somewhat serious guy miles is shorter athletic and more extroverted
youre telling me this boat has a pool with a three meter board
its a ship and thats right
plus a disco gym game room and a lot more
i think im gonna blow off new york and just stay on this thing
youll do no such thing mr
camera adjusts to reveal mcculloch holding his list checking off their names
your itinerary has been carefully planned and make no mistake it will be executed accordingly
under his breath of course
wouldnt want to risk enjoying this trip
mcculloch gives him a frown
sean steps up to him tentatively
which cabin is rennie in mr
rennies not coming
but i thought
she changed her mind
eyeing list lets see
wolfe is in stateroom one eleven and you mr
robertson are in two twenty five
a booming voice from above interrupts them sean where the hell have you been
were already into early departure protocol
standing on the upper deck is a no nonsense uniformed navy man admiral robertson
the captain of the ship
and seans father
seans sadness about rennies absence is immediately replaced with anxiety
be right up dad
he and miles head up the gangway both boys giving mcculloch one last glare
behind the wheel is miss colleen van deusen thirties attractive a progressive attitude
rennie wickham sits next to her shes seventeen pretty slightly withdrawn
rennies dog toby a border collie rides in the back seat
im glad you decided to come after all
but im not sure uncle charles will be
you let me worry about him okay
pause personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers rennie
you made the right decision
what about not so great writers
rennie smiles self deprecatingly miss van deusen grinning back
but rennies smiles are few and far between this one disappearing as she glances out the window
as the countless gallons of harbor and lake water spread out before her eery in the bog
a small rowboat grazes across it occupied by two indistinguishable people
rennies eyes show a hidden terror
she quickly turns away shivering briefly
miss van deusen notices
she turns a corner heading into the parking lot
just felt a little chill
rennie rubs her arms faking coldness
did you know that im giving up teaching
since the school is closing anyway im going to write that novel ive been threatening on everybody
thats wonderful miss van deusen
whats it about
she parks the car turning off the ignition
a senior class cruise to manhattan laced with romance adventure and murder
beat or a gothic cook book
i havent decided which
shes coaxed the smile out of rennie again
miss van deusen pulls a small wrapped box from her glove compartment handing it to rennie who seems utterly surprised
go on open it
rennie pops off the lid revealing an antique ink dip pen
stephen king supposedly used it when he was in high school
i dont know what to say
rennie youre the best student i ever had
you have a real gift
if anybody can make use of that pen its you
rennie hugs her teacher
camera rises above the cars window finding a mercedes sl pulling in a short distance away
a sexy money dressed blonde is behind the wheel
she climbs from her leather seats as a trio of senior girls walk by offering enthusiastic his and hellos
shes obviously miss popular
tamara crosses to a cute japanese girl unloading luggage from a beige honda are you ready for drugs sex and rock n roll or what girl
eva gives her a warning glance nodding to her left
evas mother appears by the passenger door forcing a smile at tamara
yes im sure
embarrassed eva hurries to her mom rushing a kiss goodbye
dont worry about a thing mom
ill have a terrific time and i wont do anything stupid okay
watanabe can squeeze a word in her daughter is gone
she waves a bittersweet goodbye to her graduate
i love you
once theyre out of mrs
watanabes earshot i hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties
im sure well have no problem getting them to party with us
especially with this
tamara unzips her purse revealing a baggie filled with fine white powder
eva looks very nervous
its my graduation gift from daddy
it cost over a thousand bucks but its the best
he bought you that
more or less
its part of my college fund
she grins coquettishly walking on
camera holds on the calm foggy harbor
where the faint image of a houseboat is aimlessly drifting into port
sure enough its the same one we saw jason on last night
but no one is behind the helm
it seems to be a ghost ship
as tamara tries to slip past mcculloch busy with another pair of seniors
you can stop right there miss mason
he motions the others onward
tamara instantly hands eva her drug filled purse paralyzing eva
only graduating seniors are allowed on this cruise
what are you talking about
you never turned in your final biology project so ive had your diploma rescinded
you cant do that
its already been done
turning to eva congratulations on the
average miss watanabe
youre in stateroom two fifty five
eva smiles awkwardly reaching for her luggage stalling to see what happens with tamara
mcculloch i got in a car accident yesterday and missed our appointment
its okay no big deal just a bruised arm
squeezes her arm so i brought my project along today
its in my suitcase
he looks at her suitcase not buying a word of this
shes telling the truth mr
i saw her pack it
hes surprised to hear this
and so is tamara
but if it mysteriously disappears en route ill have you sent back home the minute we dock
she grabs her purse back from eva quickly moving on before he changes his mind
their voices become whispers
a major prick
what are you going to do
improvise of course
as the houseboat haphazardly bumps into barnacle covered dock pilings still around fifty yards from the cruise ship
the window is splattered with blood but still clear enough to make out tamara and eva walking up the gangway along with a half dozen other teenagers mingling on board
or rather the remnants of it
its a piece of frayed woven metal charred by extreme electricity severed just above water level
suddenly theres blurry movement behind it camera rack focuses just in time to catch a glimpse of jason slipping off the side floating towards as mcculloch impatiently checks his watch
and list again
miss van deusen walks up to him
has everyone checked in
jim miller and suzy donaldson never showed up
im a little concerned
they probably decided to explore each other rather than new york
he gives her a disdainful look starting up the ramp
lets go were running two minutes late
charles theres someone else coming along too
he stops following her glance
his face tightens
rennie is walking toward them with a small suitcase her dog toby striding next to her
she walks up to him starts to say something then decides against it
rennie heads up the gangway
hold on mcculloch and miss van deusen
you have no right
and neither do you
its up to rennie to decide what she wants to do
she doesnt know what she wants
shes never had a stable life
and she sure doesnt have one now either
she needs to live
im her legal guardian not you or anybody else and i alone know whats best for her
end of discussion
no i think its just the beginning
she walks past him
as she reaches the top of the gangway her heart pounding
rennie pauses working up the courage to look out at the lake again
the rowboat she saw earlier is still there even closer now
contract her blood pumping faster
then she hears a hhhhelp me
rennie looks straight down at the water beneath her and sees floundering in the water
it takes us only a moment to recognize him its young jason
hes gasping sucking in huge amounts of liquid exactly like he did in the prologue
leans back in terror falling into miss van deusen
whats wrong rennie
rennie frantically points over the ramp edge unable to speak
miss van deusen quickly looks and sees the water is calm
no young jason
as rennie gets a hold of herself
i just got a little dizzy
she continues up the ramp
hold on miss van deusen watching her go somewhat troubled by it
rack to mcculloch below her also watching
continues along the starboard side not risking another glance overboard
she passes an older very deranged deck hand mopping the deck
hold on him his bloodshot eyes following her like a crazed raven
sharp and rusty mounted on the wall amidst jagged scaling knives shark jaws and other artifacts
widen to reveal they are surrounding a navigational chart on the cruise ships bridge
admiral robertson and his chief engineer are preparing for departure checking the omega satellite computer as well as the loran
checking watch lets take in the brow
into intercom phone
take in the gangway and single up all lines
sean and miles enter the room sean gets a glance from his dad
miles is very impressed with the bridge
hey admiral robertson
love your ship
shes a beauty isnt she
i shouldve retired from the navy ten years ago
youve really been generous to give us this cruise
i know i speak for everybody on board
with the possible exception of sean
he avoids eye contact with his father
hell theres just twenty or so of you we only need a skeleton crew and its a pleasure to sail her anyway
beat by the way congratulations on winning the intramural diving championships miles
im sure you made your old man proud
admiral robertson gives his own son a glance maybe sean should think about doing the same
have you decided on your departure protocol admiral
actually i thought id leave the honors to my son
dad i dont think
to chief engineer ignoring sean relinquishing command of the princess ruby to captain sean robertson
sean has no say in the matter
miles can feel his friends nervousness as well
but before you take the helm take this
he tosses sean a wrapped box
sean opens it
inside is a navigational computer the size of a calculator sitting next to a rusty old sextant
something old and something new
i used the sextant when i was your age but now they have these goddamn computers to do all the work for you
to sean have you decided on a plan of departure captain
he eyes the omega quickly glancing at the loran briefly referring to the navigational chart
how about if we start up the forward engines and come around
arent you forgetting something
sean looks flustered
admiral robertson storms to a large button pressing it three times piercing the air with three long blasts of the ships horn
it underscores his frustration
were in foggy weather
send out the international maritime signal that a vessel is backing down followed by a security broadcast warning other ships
he shoves the mike out at sean but he doesnt grab it leaving the bridge humiliated
theres an awkward moment for miles unable to find any appropriate words
he exits as well
admiral robertson stares out the bridge window saddened and frustrated
it wasnt supposed to go this way
as he continues away his retreat blocked by the deck hand
the crazy old man pierces a dead serious stare at sean
this voyage is doomed
yeah tell me about it
sean sidesteps him moving on
parents and relatives wave gleefully from the docks as camera rises and rotates to find eighteen or so teenagers ining the upper deck happily waving back
the ship begins to slice through serene water
the voyage has begun
the water begins to ripple as the ships speed increases
all seems normal
until jasons hands appear clinging to a loose mooring line dragging in the water
he slithers up the side towards the deck as dense fog breezes past him
as sean continues along hands in pockets
he turns a corner and collides with rennie walking her dog
his eyes instantly brighten as do hers
i heard you werent coming
glances at toby we changed our minds
sean pats her dog
theres an awkward pause
they are obviously in the early stages of a relationship
sean reaches into his coat pocket bringing back a small necklace sized box
i got you a present
but i didnt get you one
its a dumb little thing anyway
rennie opens it up exposing a petite silver necklace with a statue of liberty pendant on it
sean takes it from her snapping it around her neck
i thought maybe we could hike to the top of the statue when we got there if you felt like it
its supposed to be stories tall
id love to
your father was looking for you mr
mcculloch appears behind them
the mood has been broken
i guess ill see you later
mcculloch steps up to rennie pointing out to the foggy sea
her respiration increases as she psyches herself up to look
theres a storm predicted tonight
rennie looks at the ocean forcing herself not to turn away
youre making a big mistake rennie
its not too late to put you back on land
if miss van deusen knew how afraid you were of
she didnt push me into coming
why are you doing this to yourself
i dont even know why im afraid uncle charles
i cant even remember when it started
dont you think its time i found out and got over it
he takes a measured pause
facing your fear doesnt always conquer it
hes not going to change her mind
through a porthole window
and through the viewfinder of a video camcorder
mcculloch shakes his head turning away from rennie and walking away
a sinister electric guitar solo screeches out
pan with mcculloch as he passes the window coming around degrees into a close up of j
jarrett fingering a sleek gibson flying v
into camera is this axe awesome or what
a female rocker in the vein of band vixen continues to wail on her guitar
shes wearing a black leather corset with wildly teased deep red hair
holding the camcorder is wayne webber mtv acclimated wearing the latest hip prescription glasses
too cool j
your parents came through
she pops out the guitar cable from her practice amp
i hear theres a big power room down below where i can get supreme concert hall echo
come down and shoot a basement tape on me okay
but i gotta shoot some shockumentary footage first
he avoids eye contact when he says it
she gives him a look
man dont tell me youre still trying to scam on tamara
his non answer means yes
walks over to him grabbing his cheeks shaking them like jello
how long have we known each other
dont be a dweeb wayne
shes not interested in you only what you can do for her
shes a user
sos this guitar
ill catch you later
she mumbles something under her breath coiling up her amp cord
as he walks onward
drop down to find his feet as he passes a dark alcove
which happens to have slimy footprints and seaweed leading into it
camera follows the footprints rising again and with dim recognition our eyes fall on jason
lurking in the shadows
but not for long
massive very dark backlit steam seeping from a maze of pipes overhead
a wall of circuit breakers and voltage meters decorate one wall quietly humming generators on the opposite side
appears with her guitar amp and ghetto blaster appreciative of the surroundings
this place is aching for a video
wayne youre an asshole
she finds an outlet and plugs in her equipment
were peering at j
predatorially through the steam moving through it behind the generators
pops a cassette into her blaster jamming the play button
a loud rock n roll rhythm track blasts out
moving around the generators eyeing her sleek leather pants as she bends over to plug in her axe
snaps the male end of the plug into the female
appears for an instant through the vapor then vanishes
screams out the opening licks of her solo in sync with her playback
the generators are causing a breeze which makes her hair dance steam flowing between her legs
shes lost in her music building to a crescendo bending the high e string above the upper octave fret
she opens her eyes with the pleasure of it and sees emerging from a cloud of vapor like her worst nightmare
s scream echoes from an exhaust duct
whip pan to find the crazed deck hand standing just below it reacting with dread
hes the only one who has heard it
as jason tears the guitar off her body raising it in the air like a hatchet
the horrified girl flees down a narrow maze of steel steps forced back against a generator with nowhere to go
push in on her face for one last look at her before swings the guitar downward and buries it in j
as the deck hand flinches upon the thick dull sound of her demise followed by discordant feedback from her guitar
and eventual silence
he reaches into his breast pocket his hand shaking badly as he sips from a flask of early times
as lightning flashes over a gray choppy sea
a storm is imminent
the princess ruby finally appears cutting through whitecaps no land in sight
as rennies hand carefully dips it in india ink moving to a blank page in her journal
she hesitates for several beats
she puts down the pen looking at her dog whos curled up on the bed
what do you think
time for some personal experiences to fuel our minds
the dogs eyes blink but no more than that
rennie moves to her closet finding a silk blouse and some black satin pants
wind is picking up sweeping thick mist past a row of decorative flags
one of them flaps back
and exposes as the flag whips our faces
we move through it down the empty passageway coming to a porthole window
we peer through it with unnerving intensity at the backside of rennie as she pulls off her t shirt slipping on the blouse
camera continues through the tiny round window floating across the room over toby and the bed
until were inches from the back of rennies head
she suddenly spins around in fright facing us point blank and nobody is there her porthole window empty
but theres something surreal about the window
then eight year old jason floats up from below bubbles escaping from his lips
the porthole has become a window into the depths of crystal lake
feels her throat catch with terror and an instant later begins to bark vociferously rushing to her cabin door scratching to get out
are distracted to toby for a second when she looks back at the porthole she sees no water no drowning boy
snaps out of it moving to the door where her dog is frantically clawing with his fur up
okay toby calm down
shes talking to herself as much as the dog
rennie closes the curtains on her window then steps to her door
she swings the door open for toby
and exposes an empty hall
toby scrapes his way out of the room dashing off down the hall snarling
as toby runs straight toward us
pan with him as he rushes around a corner leading us into a view of tamara and eva disappearing down a staircase
a strong seventeen year old black kid julius gaw is going a few rounds with another senior boy whos clearly losing the boxing match
julius dances around him on the mat like hes mike tyson several other boys cheering them on
as tamara and eva step into view
eva glances around feeling out of place in the mens locker room
im not sure were supposed to be here tamara
a couple of skinny boys wearing only towels walk by
but tamara doesnt notice them her face pressed up against the glass watching julius
is that a muscular bod or what
tamara puts on a sexy smile
the other boxer sees her instead instantly distracted
julius lays him out with a left right left combination
the onlookers applaud
julius pulls out his mouthpiece giving tamara a wicked smile
hes undefeated you know that
beat julius is the only senior id even consider doing it with
if he wasnt black that is
awkward my parents are open minded about that sort of thing
my stepmom couldnt care less but daddy would have a shit fit
lets it slip out he might even pay some attention to me
tamara quickly puts up her veneer again spotting something
gorgeous guy at ten oclock
both girls slip into instant sultry as a crew member in his mid twenties passes them wearing a tool belt
he gives the girls a pleasant smile
tamara turns around to check out his back side
i think its time for some recreational activity girl
i hear theres a shuffleboard court on deck it might be kinds cool
youre joking right
she wasnt but eva tries to act like she was
tamara walks on eva following
as mcculloch steps from rennies room looking very worried
wayne webber passes by his eye stuck in his viewfinder
mcculloch yanks the camcorder away from his face
have you seen my niece anywhere
yeah motivating downstairs i think
whats the problem mr
senior predictions started five minutes ago and she hasnt shown up
some of us dont want our futures predicted
in your case im sure thats true
he brushes past wayne angrily
as tamara drags eva into a secluded service area pulling out her mirror straw and baggie
the night time is the right time
tamara hands the straw to eva
nervous no thanks
dont be a lightweight
this is top dollar toot
its not that its just that
beat it i get caught ill lose my science scholarship and everything
youre talking to the prom queen eva
do you really think im going to risk getting caught
a pause i guess not
do you realize how many people would kill to be sitting here right now
come on its grad night
youve got your whole life to be uptight
eva takes the straw
as we move down the corridor in and out of shadows hearing giggles from tamara and eva up ahead
as eva takes a nosefull sneezing badly
is that unbelievable or what
tamara giggles getting ready to tap out another line
but the snickering stops upon the sound of approaching footsteps
they both look up every muscle tensing with fear as appears from the shadows just as startled to see them
its not jason at all
rennie cant help noticing the cocaine trying hard to ignore it
jesus you scared the hell out of us
have you seen my dog
i think he came this way
no we havent
awkwardly care for a hit
rennie continues on
after shes gone
a real space cadet
i wonder if shell narc on us
i have her in creative writing and shes fairly nice
nobody related to mcculloch can be nice
tamara puts the straw to her nose
as she presses on the corridor getting darker
she walks on turning down the left hallway
but camera turns down the right hallway
suddenly jason reveals himself quietly stepping from the game room
hes holding a pool cue which he proceeds to snap in half providing a splintery sharp shaft
as tamara finishes off her line wiping her nose with a sniffle
ready to party and then some
she rolls up her baggie stuffing it into her purse
as we come down a corridor turning into the service area stomping right up to tamara and eva
they both gasp tamara drops her mirror which shatters on the ground
they are facing mcculloch
what are you doing in here
he eyes the broken mirror
he wasnt born yesterday
are you girls using drugs
do you think i would use drugs mr
we were just exploring the ship
he doesnt want to believe eva is a druggie
but tamara is a different matter
he levels his eyes on her
i be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes miss mason
youd better have your biology project ready or im phoning your parents
theyre out of town
then ill make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights
hes gotten to her with that one
mcculloch storms away
what are you going to do
relax ive got mcculloch covered
but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter
calculating rumor has it shes a teensy bit afraid of the water
as a body pierces the surface of the deck swimming pool
its miles having just completed a dive from the high board
miss van deusen and several others stand at poolside giving him some applause
poetry in motion miles
a half twist short
ill hone that dive yet
he swims to the side leading us to a view of rennie
shes very cautious about getting too close to the pool edge as she approaches miss van deusen
rennie i was just on my way over to your room have you seen my dog anywhere
no but im sure tobys fine
the ships only so big and theres certainly no way off it is there
she smiles reassuringly but her words are less than comforting
as the canine continues to sniff out jason through the maze of corridors
track with the dog as he slows his pace knowing hes getting close to something
low to the ground creeping past a steam vent which obscures his vision then turning down a metal staircase weaving into another passageway
then with absolutely no warning a body falls from above thudding directly in rears back with teeth bared but is quite dead toby is snarling at the corpse of the
teenage boxer who lost his bout against julius
hes still in his boxing shorts
but jasons splintery pool as they walk along the edge of the pool
so are you having fun yet
i seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone
beat in other words level with me
a pause theres something i havent told you
but before she can begin the next sentence rennie is shoved from behind
as she splashes into the pools deep end
spins around seeing tamara standing there with eva
flounders at the surface nobody realizing the terror shes experiencing
shes too scared to even cry for help
isnt looking at rennie her attention on admonishing tamara
why on earth would you do something like that
it was an accident i swear
eva avoids eye contact feeling awful
sean comes walking up seeing rennie
to rennie rennie are you okay
shes cant even hear sean her vision being splashed by the chlorinated water
she sinks under the surface turning around
and coming face to face with young jason
the eight year old corpse grabs her ankle and as rennie sinks under the surface all alone thrashing in terror
realizes shes in trouble
he immediately dives in after her pulling her to the pools edge where miss van deusen helps to lift her out
quickly move on
that was truly excellent
feels like shit yeah
time to check out the waiters
i think ill pass
see you later okay
wait a minute
eva walks away
tamara acts angry but deep down shes hurt
some friend you are
as sean climbs from the pool to join miss van deusen who is trying to comfort rennie
to sean bring her a towel okay
sean nods hurrying off as others start to crowd around
miss van deusen looks up at them
shes fine everybody go back to what you were doing
rennie slowly starts to cry holding tight to her teacher
care to talk about it
after a moment to compose herself
i cant swim
i gathered that
rennie says nothing else
miss van deusen knows shes holding out
i had a skiing accident in high school broke my left leg
it took three winters before i would even look at the snow again
but the solution kept eluding me
beat i finally took lessons
ive never broken a bone since
its not that simple
but youre not telling me everything are you
long pause whenever i get near the water i see this young boy drowning
he tries to pull me down with him
the teacher didnt expect this taking a thoughtful pause
when did this start
about four years ago
at crystal lake
i spent a few summers there with uncle charles inbetween boarding school
after your parents passed away
rennie nods somberly
did you have an accident in the lake
it was just a normal summer
ive never been able to figure it out
only one young boy ever drowned in that lake and that was before you were even born
his name was jason voorhees
the name has triggered some deep memory
but the recollection vanishes upon the sound of her uncles voice
as mcculloch rushes over to rennie seeing that shes soaked
shes fine charles
take it easy
oh i can see that
youve done a wonderful job of supervising the kids miss van deusen
it wasnt her fault
he gets rennie to her feet just as sean runs back with a towel
mcculloch grabs it from him wrapping it around his niece facing both miss van deusen and sean
stay away from her
both of you
he starts to lead her away
the crazy deck hand blocks their path slipping his flask away
hes come back and youre all going to die
rennie gazes at the deck hand then back at mcculloch
leave me alone
she pulls away from him hurrying off confused and frightened
mccullochs retinas pierce the deck hand with scorn
he checks his watch then storms off
as a loud firm knock punctuates the silence
then comes a sultry voice
the doors open
mcculloch swings it open
im in no mood for any more stall tactics miss mason
where is your final project
as tamara fills a pair of champagne glasses with a bottle of dom perignon
shes wearing a full body robe
wouldnt you like a glass of champagne first charles
hes about to lose his temper
mcculloch steps closer
where did you get that alcohol
i packed it
just for us
as we approach tamaras porthole window peering through it
we cant hear the words but we can clearly see the people
as mcculloch takes the bottle from her setting it down on her nightstand
youre not setting foot off this ship until we return home
but i havent even shown you my biology project
tamara unties her robe
pan down to the floor with it as it softly piles at her bare feet
as the shadow outside quickly blurs past the window
mcculloch is flabbergasted too stunned to fully react
tamara is wearing a layered teddy which shes beginning to unsnap exposing her lithe body
but thats not all
tamara has drawn all her major organs on her bare skin
take a closer look charles
i want to make sure i labeled all my organs correctly
as we approach her door still cracked open from mccullochs entrance
we get there just in time to see tamara slip her arms around mcculloch planting her lips on his pressing her nubile flesh up against his stiffly starched shirt
as she holds him tight
he finally breaks away in a fit of anger
oh youve done it now
not only are you going home ill see to it that you spend next year back in a high school classroom
he storms for the door swinging it open coming face to face with who casually lowers his camcorder
i dont think so mr
to wayne did you get anything good
his eyes are unable to leave her nakedness
she quickly slips on her robe again all business
mcculloch realizes what has just transpired
youll never get away with it
eyeing wayne and you can forget about ever attending any film school
serious beat youre both going to be very very sorry
he storms off
wayne looks very very nervous
tamara steps over to him cuddling up
he wont risk doing a thing
beat can i have the tape
he pops the eject button absently handing it over
wayne steps into her room nervous and excited to be there
he lifts the glass of champagne she poured for mcculloch
this is going to sound supremely lame
but ive had the major hots for you since our sophomore year tamara
he gulps down the fizz
she forces a smile stashing the incriminating videotape
thats sweet wayne
look id love to chat but im really pressed for time
ushering him to door lets try to get together later okey doke
but i thought
thanks for the camerawork
and out he goes the door shut in his face
wayne stands outside her room realizing hes a major chump
wayne youre an asshole
he despondently exits
as tamara heads for the bathroom slipping off her robe
she moves to the shower curtain and were right behind her
her hand reaches up grabbing the curtain yanking it back
nothing is there
as rennie enters her eyes reddened
she moves to the sink looking at herself in the mirror
so much for the silk blouse and satin pants not to mention her soaked hair
rennie runs some warm water rinsing her face
when she starts to fill her hands a second time blood pours out the faucet instead of water
rennie gasps jerking up and seeing young jason reflected on the other its not real its not real
as water from the shower head splashes camera for a beat before tamara turns it off
as tamara reaches for her robe slipping it on
her body paint has been washed off
she steps from the shower glancing in her vanity mirror and seeing the real jason reflected in it
tamara spins around looking face to face with jason in her bathroom
just as she screams young jason reaches out to grab rennie his fist crashing through the mirror
right when rennie screams the real jason shatters tamaras vanity mirror with his fist
he grabs a sharp chunk of it advancing on a whimpering tamara
jason raises the shard above her and just as she as it blasts loudly in the bleak stormy night
it begins to rain
as rennie comes rushing out right into the arms of
she clings to him sobbing as the rain falls over them
youre going to be okay
i want to go home
i want off this ship
after a moment
beat lets go talk to my dad
he puts his arm around her leading her toward the bridge
as wind and rain pummel the bridge window
admiral robertson turns to his chief engineer
lets kick in the stablilizers mr
carlson and get the seas off the quarter
these kids are in for one hell of a storm
activating comfort cruise mode
the chief engineer moves to a bank of toggle switches flipping a row of them
as a bloodstained hand silently removes the rusty harpoon hanging above the map
gets a reflective look in his weary eyes
how olds your boy now carlson
a tremendous age
take some advice from a salty old man dont push him too hard
the chief engineer nods with a sympathetic smile as the admiral steps off the bridge onto the stormy deck contemplating the sea
the chief engineer moves to the radio intercom console
he lifts a telephone punching in a three digit number
push in tight on his face
this is the bridge
approaching weather suggests we secure the main deck and
his sentence is sharply cut off his head jerking from excruciating instant pain
his mouth contorts with words no one will ever hear as he stares into the face of holding the opposite end of the harpoon
he shoves it forward with one more staccato jerk and the harpoons bloody corroded tip pierces through his once white uniform
returns to the bridge as lightning flashes outside
better have them doublecheck the lifeboat stations as well
admiral robertson stops cold upon the sight of mr
he hurries over to him kneeling down freezing as a pair of muddy feet enter frame
admiral robertson bends his neck upwards to face hovering over him now clutching one of the scaling knives
as sean and rennie walk up the corridor leading to the bridge
can he really take us home
not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for
but i think i can convince him to call a coast guard cutter for you
what about you
if i go with you hell never speak to me again
beat but im never going to live up to his expectations anyway
so maybe its the right thing to do
hes made a big decision
sean takes her hand as they walk on
moving closer and closer to the bridge door having not the slightest inclination of whats in store for them
knocks on the bridge door
he pushes the door open but something is blocking it
sean puts his weight into it shoving hard
as the door slides open sean stepping inside
his eyes roil downwards upon seeing the dead chief engineer the oh jesus
sean looks over at the helm
where his father is still sitting in the swivel chair his back to them
sean sidesteps the chief engineers corpse moving toward his father as rennie remains frozen in shock
slowly walking toward admiral robertson
at least he thinks its his dad because hes unable to see his face
is it jason now wearing the uniform
when hes about two feet away from him
reaches out and swivels the chair around
it is his father but his throat has been slit
sean staggers backwards uncomprehending his senses overloaded
we move with him until hes backed into rennie clutching onto him tightly
as miss van deusen steps up to rennies door gently knocking
i just came by to see how you were feeling
she knocks harder
and it creaks open unlocked
suddenly the door is jerked from her grasp and swung open
mcculloch is standing on the other side of it
i thought i told you to stay away from her
holds her ground where is she
accusing thats a very good question and id appreciate an answer
a loud buzzer blares out of an intercom speaker next to their heads causing the teachers to both jump
seans unsteady voice immediately follows
attention everybody attention
this is sean robertson
miles is toweling off under the shelter of a gazebo as seans voice blares out of a rain pounded megaphone speaker nearby
swallows what i mean is this is an emergency
miles knows he cant be joking around
wayne comes walking by covering his camcorder with his jacket
miles have you seen j
she was supposed to be jamming down in the power room but
miles gestures for him to be quiet listening very worriedly
repeat this is an emergency
as julius and two other senior boys finish dressing after a shower hearing seans words reverberate around them
i want everybody to meet on the bridge
what the fuck is this
the others shrug concerned
the wooden shuffleboard disks are drowning in precipitation
eva stands alone in the rain staring at the court as seans voice continues
stay calm but get here as quick as possible
walk with a friend if you can
eva wipes the rain from her face then walks away
trying his best to keep it together
he glances at his dead father still unable to believe it
god i wish this was a joke but its not
sean slowly puts down the phone
hes lost in a daze
suddenly the ship lurches a huge swell splashing the bridge window
admiral robertsons body falls from the swivel chair
what is happening
sean regains his balance moving to the computer console looking at the omega and loran like hes never seen them before
i dont know
weve gone off course or something
what do you mean
another wave hammers the bow
shes in a state of awful panic
i dont know what i mean
alls i know is that theres no one guiding this ship anymore
sean is starting to lose it
the fear of the ocean guiding her rennie rushes to him gripping and shaking him
cant you call for help
sean tries to get a grip and assess the situation pacing frenetically
i think so
but we have to lower the anchors so we dont drift any further
where are they
front of the ship
theres a hoist on each side that lowers them she starts to exit
i didnt mean for you to go
just radio for help okay
she hurries out the door working on terror induced adrenaline
sean rushes to the radio console depressing the keying button speaking into the mike
mayday mayday mayday
as julius arrives with the others from the locker room
they react to the dead bodies while sean continues at the radio
can anybody out there hear me
wayne and miles rush in
sean whats going on
then he sees the corpses
he needs no further answer
hes too scared to even videotape it
sean is bombarded with questions as he tries to figure out the radio
who did this man
is the radio even working
isnt there some international s
thing you can do
suddenly remembers channel
the distress frequency
dialing knob mayday mayday mayday
this is the princess ruby
please somebody answer
as a coast guard cutter tracks through stormy seas
this is coast guard cutter dallas
what is the nature of your problem ruby
as they hear the voice reacting relieved and thrilled
the captain and chief engineer
a grave pause what is your location
i dont know
is your ship equipped with omega satellite navigation or loran
the loran has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude
give me the coordinates and well be there as quick as we can
sean hurries to the loran reading the numbers
as lightning strikes above it in the night sky
camera slowly adjusts to find the radio antenna cable
a second later jasons hand reaches for it getting a firm grasp
as sean hurries back to the radio pressing it against his spitless mouth
ive got the numbers
give me the degrees first followed by minutes and sec
suddenly his voice is cut off followed by static
are you there
a lump sinks into everyones throat
as jason drops the cable hes just torn out marching onward
as mcculloch bursts onto the bridge followed by miss van deusen
i demand to know what is going on
oh dear god
shes seen the bodies
mcculloch follows her glance paling
he quickly takes charge pushing through the students
wheres the radio
youre all going to die
all heads spin as the deranged deck hand treads out from a shadowy corridor
youre the last ones
hes come back for you
what are you talking about
the deck hand takes a final swig from his flask dropping it with unsteady hands
there is a collective disconcerting silence triggered by the infamous name
youre insane old man
jason voorhees has been dead for over thirty years
he walks this ship here and now
a killer walks this ship indeed
and its certainly none of us
the crazed old man gets his drift
everyone looks at him suspiciously
mcculloch grabs a scaling knife off the wall taking a step towards him
youre the one whos insane
the raving man flees back the way he came
mcculloch raises the flare gun miss van deusen grabs mccullochs arm stopping him
what are you doing
that lunatic has been spouting off about jason since we boarded
eyeing bodies its no coincidence
but that doesnt prove that hes the one
walking corpses are not real
yeah well these dead bodies are sure enough real
to the others i say we regroup and find this motherfucker before he finds us
theres a murmur it makes sense
youll do no
such thing and watch your mouth young man
im in charge here
they all look at mcculloch defiantly
schools out mcculloch
to the others lets go
julius walks off the bridge all the seniors follow except sean
please everybody stay here
they dont listen
mcculloch starts to go after them
and then it hits him christ
shes dropping the anchors
i thought the coast guard could find us easier if
you sent her out there with a murderer running around loose
as rennie moves past wet empty lounge chairs towards the bow
she passes a row of translucent windows
the first three are normal
but the fourth has the silhouette of he begins to stride parallel to her then disappears when the windows end and a wall takes over
as julius and his followers continue on passing eva whos coming up from a staircase
she stops wayne
whats going on
i heard on the p
interrupting the captains been murdered
the buzz is that jason might be on board
she knows the legend as weld as everybody else
wayne nods gravely moving to catch up with the others
eva rushes up to him again
have you seen tamara
and im not losing any sleep over it
but she might be in trouble
so what else is new
beat look eva youre asking the wrong dude to feel sorry for tamara mason
wise up its not hip to be her friend
i dont care about being hip anymore
she means it
wayne nods with understanding
im sorry but ive gotta find j
he hurries on
as rennie appears fighting the wind and rain to get closer to the anchor hoists
spying on rennie like a wolf watching a lamb
we move a few windows down getting a better view of her
deciding that the time is right to strike
his hand moves to the bow entrance door knob slowly turning it pulling it open
moving closer to the right anchor hoist her back to us as well as jason
she climbs behind the hoist looking at the consoles
then suddenly a bark
she turns catching a glimpse of her dog running down the side of the deck
rennie leaves the hoist going after toby
through the crack in the door watching rennie unexpectedly take off
hes about to move after her when ha hears tamara
are you around here anywhere
jason quietly closes the door
rennie will have to wait
as she cautiously walks along poking her head in every alcove
moving down the same corridor catching a glimpse of eva before she turns a corner and disappears
eva steps into the hallway outside tamaras stateroom
she walks up to tamaras door knocking on it
it swings open unlocked
no response i just want to talk with you
she steps into tamaras room and we go in with her
the quarters are empty
eva stands there for a beat confused and scared
shes about to leave when a creaking sound causes her to look back at it slowly swings open
splashing evas eyes with grotesque multi images of tamara she is hanging on the shrieks running back out the door
and sliding to a abrupt halt because jason is standing at the end of the hallway
he moves toward eva like a bulldozer
she turns a rapid and sprints in retreat
gasping for oxygen eva has no time to even scream as she flees from the monster erratically turning down a spiral staircase and running on
chasing after her with the smooth determination of a shark never letting her get too far in the lead
empty for a second then eva appears weaving her way through a maze of corridors and passageways
she races past a sign directing passengers to club ruby
entering the same corridor a beat after eva exits it in the direction of the disco
he tramples onward
the thudding low frequency of a mesmerizing dance tune precedes eva as she tears open a door entering the corridor
move backwards with her as she rushes forward curving through the shallow passageway and emptying out onto a high tech disco floor
a flashing star wars lighting system assaults her all directions along with the music
shes all alone in here
the lights strobing across her face only accentuate her terror
she spots another door on a small stage rushing to it
as jason enters the corridor slamming the door shut decides this is the wrong place to be
she moves for the corridor again and appears on the corridor steps for a brief second
the spotlight goes black then flashes on again
now hes gone
backs away sliding along the edge of the dance floor like shes on a building ledge
chaser lights and mirror balls fondle her body as she moves as far away from the point where she last saw him
but illuminates only ten feet from her a crimson strobe assaulting his hockey mask
shes on a collision course with him
whirls dizzily to the center of the dance floor upon the sight of him
camera spins with her in degree arcs pushing in on her face
spiraling counter clockwise on the dance floor flashes of jason materializing where she least expects to see him
and getting closer
finally at the point of exhaustion stops looking everywhere
he seems to be gone
she catches her breath
then sensing his presence she revolves a half turn to face exploding under a pin spotlight standing directly before her
his forearms recoil with lightning speed as he grips her throat
and jason and eva at the center of it all
her feet are twenty four inches off of her
finally evas legs go rag doll limp
jason flings her to the ground like a sack of flour
this dance is over
rennie appears again scanning her no visibility surroundings
whered you go
no sign of her dog
she remembers her mission heading to the anchors again
as rennie arrives on the bow climbing into the left hoist box behind the huge anchor cable
moving up to the bow door like jason did before cracking it open seeing rennie from behind
and moving towards her
is oblivious as she reads the directions above the controls
as rennies hand grabs it shoving it forward
a moment later her thumb finds it and depresses it
as the massive black chain links thunder to life
hes now within ten feet of the unaware girl
remains in the hoist box making certain it is operating correctly
a second later we see the fleeting outline of a human shape appear behind her
three feet from rennie
she spins around to climb out of the hoist box and gasps
shes facing mcculloch
he immediately reaches past her yanking the lever back to its center position and grinds to a halt
as mcculloch faces her angrily grabbing rennies arms shouting over the storm
you had me worried to death
but sean said
im the one you should be listening to
do you think dropping an anchor in the middle of a storm makes any sense whatsoever
she tries to find some defense but mcculloch leads her off before any wards come forth
as a pair of skeet rifles three fire axes a flare gun and several pool cues are dumped onto the foam padded plastic
where julius has gathered his small group of vigilantes including miles and wayne
i managed to scrounge this shit from the game room and hallways
grab what you want
wayne takes one of the rifles miles grabs the axe
what are you taking julius
flexes fists nothin
dead serious were talking the possibility of jason voorhees here
hes not stupid
nothin but this gun
he reaches down picking up the other rifle
and they move
as mcculloch guides his niece down the hallway swinging her door open
cant we at least talk about it
i refuse to discuss this ridiculous notion that a ghoul is terrorizing this ship
but what about the drowning boy ive been seeing
he avoids eye contact
mcculloch takes her hand ushering her across the threshold
shes standing inside her room now hes in the hallway
whatever youve been
has nothing to do with jason voorhees
pause i want you to be safe rennie
thats all i care about
im not staying in my room uncle charles
this isnt a request
he closes the door on her face pulling out a key locking the dead bolt
she pounds on it from the other side
he ignores her briskly walking away
as she throws her fists against the door a final time realizing its futile
steam continues to seep from the maze of criss crossing pipes
wayne appears on one of the catwalks
hes holding the skeet rifle under one arm using the sun gun off his video camera to guide him
you down here
as wayne carefully lets his light guide him down the precarious walkway
an unexpected blast of steam scares the crap out of him causing him to stumble
they slip off the bridge of his nose skittering down through the catwalk and pipes to god knows where
lies helplessly on the metal grid work realizing his bleak predicament has just been squared
he pulls himself to a standing position again
we got a major problem wayne
his vision now gives him shadows and shapes rather than crisp images
he raises the gun and continues unsteadily forward
as wayne inches forward
camera slowly pans into a profile of jason watching him from a catbird seat
takes another step almost tripping on a set of stairs leading down to the next level
and when he arrives there
instantly raises the rifle and fires
and the body goes down
hes hit him
stands there breathing some relief
he gets an idea looking through his camcorder eyepiece
wayne begins to adjust the eyepiece diaptor
as the figure on the ground slips in and out of focus finally becoming crisp
wayne has shot a crew member the same good looking one tamara and eva ogled earlier
hes holding a screwdriver from his waist band tool set not a knife
slowly lowers his camera as his heart rises into his throat
he raises his camcorder again hoping a second view will reveal a dead jason rather than this young man
he gets half his wish a hockey mask now fills his frame
but jason is far from dead
wayne catches a split second glimpse of jasons fist coming towards him then the camera is knocked from his eye and the world becomes screams blindly running as fast as
he trips picking himself up stumbling down the catwalk stairs
wayne makes it about ten feet before he stumbles over something bringing with it a harsh strum from an sure enough his left shoe is resting on the pickups of
a blood streaked gibson flying v
sprawled out on the metal floor
he gropes around his hands feeling something
it sends chills from his groin up through his scalp
no no no
waynes hands are touching j
s bloody face a large crack in her skull
he doesnt have time to scream or cry because hoists him off of j
s body and flings him into which shorts out with a fanfare of electrical sparks as the overhead lights briefly flicker then resume normal operation
sean stands opposite the navigational chart ping ponging between it and the ships computers as miss van deusen paces nervously
what was that
very worried i dont know
trying not to panic what happens if we dont get control of the ship sean
i want you to tell me the truth
beat we could hit a reef collide with another ship
we could be out here for weeks before anybody spotted us
they are suddenly jolted with a door slam as mcculloch storms onto the bridge
did you find rennie
shes locked safe in her room no thanks to either of you
like sean isnt even in the room has he brought it back on course yet
sean doesnt look at him still trying to assimilate the wall of components
hes doing the best he can charles
hes the son of the captain for chrissakes
youd think hed be able to operate this thing
sean closes his eyes trying to keep from losing his mind and temper
a fierce wave slaps the windows in front of seans face motivating him to get his shit together
he checks the omega and loran
sean doesnt answer moving to the seat behind the helm
his fathers seat
sean takes the chair adjusting the wheel watching the compass
he studies a series of buttons on the console
we pan across them stopping on one labeled fire alarm do not break except in case of emergency
camera continues around to find we are in the power room not on the bridge
our vision suddenly lands on jason staring at the alarm button considering
he glances back over his shoulder
waynes body is now on fire
and the blaze is spreading as sean makes up his mind flipping several toggle switches
as sean flips the last toggle and a green light illuminates indicating the auto pilot is in effect
were back on course
sean feels his confidence instantly rejuvenated
miss van deuten immediately embraces him
but a fraction of time later jasons fist smashes the alarm button
and a loud siren cries out across the entire vessel
the blood drains from seans face
the fire alarm
as the shrieking alarm assaults the main deck hallways and corridors giving julius miles and wayne deep pause for thought
as the alarm bombards rennies ears like everybody elses
she hurries to her curtained porthole window working up the energy to look outside
rennie gets a grip on them flinging them open
the deck hands crazed face is gazing back at her
rennie screams a second later he hurries off
as mcculloch tears open a cabinet door labeled emergency flare gun
the siren continues to blast
can you shut that damn thing off
sean moves to a bank of switches his eyes darting around for the appropriate switch
miss van deusen sees mcculloch remove the flare gun from the cabinet
we already thought of that nobody could possibly see it in this storm
theres only one person who needs to see it
and im going to find him
what about the fire
i doubt very much that one even exists
what are you talking about
use some common sense
setting off a fire alarm causes panic
the same kind of panic caused by suggesting jason voorhees is on board
resolved enough is enough
he marches out the door
sean finds the alarm kill switch flipping it
the excruciating siren vanishes
he grabs a pair of rain jackets tossing one to miss van deusen
we have to get everybody together just in case the fires for real
sean heads for the door shoving it forward
as it slams open
and julius steps out not sean from a different deck door
track with him as he treads along the side of the ship skeet rifle raised
walking past the lifeboat stations the wind and precipitation battering the small boats
with no warning shoves the gun stock into his shoulder and takes instantaneous aim
but he doesnt shoot
he slowly lowers the rifle
as miles lowers the axe
theyve just scared the shit out of each other
ill take the upper deck
neither boy notices the smoke which is starting to emerge from a deck vent
filled with black smoke
the fire is spreading dangerously close to a series of hoses attached to a fuel pump leading to tanks below
a sign over them reads steaming and far from calm as the weather blitzes it
miles appears climbing a ladder to the upper deck level
someone is spying on miles from below watching his every step
as miles arrives axe raised
he pauses to regard his surroundings then moves on
rack focus to find jason right behind him having followed miles up the stairs
only darkness and rain for a beat then miles materializes curving around the gargantuan smokestack
he passes us and we swing around now looking at the back of his head
he takes three more steps and jason steps into the foreground
miles senses his presence and jerks but jason easily grabs the axe handle before it makes contact flinging it away
hes pacing along when a clattering noise from above makes him stop
suddenly miles axe thuds into the mahogany deck next to his foot
julius gazes at it jerking his head upward
his answer is a loud crack of lightning
at the same time hes scrambling as fast as he can across the slippery deck as the monster relentlessly pursues him
hes having no problem catching up to the defenseless teenager
as julius zooms up them to aid his comrade
as miles slides up to the mast and begins scaling it
he glances downward and sees jason is right at his heels
slips on a rung regains control and continues upward
he makes it three more steps almost at the uppermost point when jason grabs the back of his coat tearing him miles cries out as he freefalls backwards somersaulting and
twisting like hes doing one of his better dives
empty space for a half second then miles face jolts into frame with a look of ultimate agony
something has abruptly stopped his fall
something quite fatal
coming around a corner stopping dead in his tracks his stomach wrenching as his eyes fall on who is staring right back at him with dead pupils
doesnt get the chance to grasp the reality of it because slugs him squarely in the face
the force of it sends the boxer reeling backwards off the railing
and julius splashes into the rough sea
hes quickly swallowed by the torrential waters
as rennies hand jiggles her doorknob again confirming that its locked tight
rise to find her desperate face she begins furiously pacing and we dolly behind her but rennie stops cold upon hearing hhhhelp
rennie whirls into a close up staring with disbelief at who is standing on the oval rug in her stateroom his hands reaching out to her
but then comes the inexplicable the oval rug turns into lake water and jason sinks into it
hes drowning in the middle of her room choking on murky water
stands frozen feeling herself drawn to him like a magnet
she crawls to the edge of her rug which is now a deep lake and extends her arms to him
grabs her hand pulling hard then grinning wide
feels the skin on her face crawling off her skull her eyes expanding because shes now looking at rennie is holding onto herself about four years younger in a bathing
suit drowning in the lake
screams with guttural fear letting go of herself watching her younger self drown in the hole in her room
disappears under the surface of the water
which seconds later changes back into her oval rug
as rennie moves away tears rolling down her face utterly confused
she backs against the wall next to her porthole window and the real jasons fist smashes through the window grabbing her throat
rennie struggles gasping for air as he attempts to strangle her
groping for a weapon to stop him her fingers skittering across her table like a spider
her head is pulled taut against the wall just below the porthole with jasons hideous mask framed in the circular shattered window
shes slowly dying
her movements slow as the oxygen leaves her system
but rennies fingers miraculously find a recognizable object the ink dip pen given to her by miss van deusen
she seizes it getting a firm grip
as rennie jabs the pen backwards sending the sharp instrument through the eyehole of his mask
jason instantly releases her reeling backwards
sinks to the floor scrambling on all fours to get as far away from the porthole as possible
she makes it across the room to her stateroom door just as is slammed open from the other side
she shrieks in terror but its sean who is standing there
pointing the window
sean rushes to the shattered porthole looking out seeing nothing
he steps back to her
i dont understand what is happening to me
she breaks down he holds her
its gonna be okay
but sean couldnt be more wrong
the flames are lapping at the fuel pump and hoses furiously burning down into the tank
a second later the whole thing as a huge hole is blown through the thick steel hull the ship noticeably rocks from the explosion
rennie clings to him fearfully
what is it
one second later the lights begin to flicker
the power room
as huge amounts of water rush in from a gaping hole in the hull
as the overhead lights flicker over mcculloch
theres some fear mixed with the anger as he grips his flare gun moving onward
someone is crouched behind a massive convection oven spying on mcculloch
almost flinches when the lights die and hes plunged into blackness
he moves forward every step tentative
he passes the convection ovens and we remain on them spotting the frightened face of the deck hand in the shadows
the deranged old man is very sober now clutching a large kitchen knife for defense
sean paces feverishly in the blackness of her room trying to think talking to himself
rule one dont panic
rule two assess the damage and act accordingly
is the ship going to sink
he returns to rennie the panic settling back in
i dont know
her ultimate fear is staring her straight in the face
suddenly the dim blue lights flicker on
the emergency lights just kicked in
sean makes rennie look into his eyes
his words are meant to convince himself as much as rennie
well be okay
i want you to wait by the lifeboats just in case
terrified im not going near any lifeboat
as miss van deusen gathers a handful of students who are panicking sitting them down
everybody wait right here until i come back with the others understand
they nod frightened to death
she dashes away carrying us into a view of the dining room windows
no one notices the silhouette of jason passing by on the outside desk
sea water is pouring into the ships motors
clouds of steam and black smoke fill the room as the engine bearings begin to grind
as mcculloch rushes up to rennies already open door cautiously entering with flare gun raised
the room is empty shards of the porthole glass scattered across her rug
he steps over to it bringing his head up to the gaping hole peering outside
we wait for his attack
but it doesnt come
mccullochs eyes take us to something across the room
the bathroom door is afar
cautiously steps up to the door silently grabbing the knob and swinging it open
he hears something spinning around
again nothing is there
mcculloch quickly moves to the telephone and dials
a few seconds pass
come on answer
tight on the bridge telephone ringing repeatedly
rise to find jason ignoring the phone scrutinizing the deck below through rain streaked windows
miss van deusen is darting across the deck gathering up a trio of terrified seniors
jason methodically moves to the bank of switches studying them
in large unmistakable letters over a red button are the words abandon ship alarm
he flips back the plastic safety cover exposing the button
a horrible grinding sound echoes through the narrow corridor
sean and rennie appear at the opposite end coughing on the black smoke which clouds their passageway
sean looks down seeing that they are standing in a puddle of water
water has gotten to the engines
coughs we have to get everybody off this ship
as jason presses it with firm deliberation and a whooping siren blasts through the passageway
sean and rennie have no time to react because a sealed compartment door explodes open with the pressure and a wall of water engulfs
rennie and sean knocking them down
sean fights to pull her up but not in time for her to witness which bobs up in front of her
rennie cries out scrambling to grab onto sean as whats left of waynes body washes past them
as a door opens and miss van deusen guides a half dozen seniors over to the lifeboat stations
shouting over storm everybody climb in
they follow her orders as the abandon ship alarm wretches on
but little do they know that someone is briskly moving towards the group and miss van deusen
just as we are within a few feet of her
its mcculloch whos approached them
he grabs miss van deusen shaking her violently
what did you do with rennie
i went to her cabin and
mcculloch rushes off before she can finish
miss van deusen turns back to the other kids helping them into the boat
we slowly dolly backwards until miles axe comes into frame still stuck in the mahogany decking
a beat then as sean climbs up from below soaked to the bone pulling up a half conscious rennie
sean carries her around a corner where he collides with mcculloch
mcculloch pulls rennie away from him
she never shouldve set foot on this ship
this is your fault
this is jasons fault
shouting not another word do you hear me
as miss van deusen throws the down lever and the lifeboat hoist begins to lower the boat
camera slowly one of the students screams the others clinging together upon the sight of this infamous monster
but the boat is already over the edge past the point of return
and lowering at a snails pace
turns to see jason approaching them with axe raised
she backs away but jason ignores her heading directly for the hoist
he arches back with his weapon and slices as jasons axe chops the cable in two and the bow cable snaps dumping the half dozen teenagers into the turbulent salt
they last about five seconds before succumbing to a drowning death
sees it all her intestines constricting in agonizing knots
she summons all her rationale and sends it down to her legs running away as fast as she can
knocking down deck tables chairs and chaise lounges as she flees
the creative writing teacher swerves around a column heading for an interior door sliding to a stop as it bangs open in front of her
mcculloch steps outside carrying rennie with sean right behind her
rennie is conscious now squirming free of her uncle upon the sight of miss van deusen
as rennie rushes into miss van deusens arms
the teacher holds her beginning to cry herself
why arent you with the others woman
finally the message comes forth jason
he has an axe
his face grows taut with anger
jason voorhees is dead
a primal scream of agony immediately cries out behind them the words unintelligible
they turn around to witness the deck hang staggering towards them gripping raises the flare gun with zero hesitation and fires it
and the charge explodes into his chest
he stands there with his chest smoldering almost like a gargoyle in effigy
a second later the poor old man falls forward and they all see that jasons axe has been buried in his mcculloch gazes with utter disbelief
we have to get off this ship
they back away from the horrid sight and begin to run the abandon ship alarm still attacking their ears
as mcculloch miss van deusen rennie and sean scramble to the closest lifeboat
everybody in ill get the hoists mcculloch has no time for politeness moving to the lifeboat ahead of the women
rennie stops cold gazing classy eyed at the small boat
come on sweetheart get in
but she doesnt budge
mcculloch levels wild eyes on her quickly climbing back down
get in the boat rennie
shaking her you can and you will
he tries to slap her out of it dragging her over to the boat ignoring her terror stricken frenzy
leave her alone charles
miss van deusen quickly moves to a hysterical rennie and holds her eyeing mcculloch vehemently
as rain begins to wash the blood from his back
jasons foot trudges into frame
then his hand reaches down as rennie clings to miss van deusen crying
its the only way rennie
lets get in the boat now okay
rennie finds herself nodding
miss van deusen helps the trembling girl up the steps an angered mcculloch right behind
as rennie climbs over the boat edge recoiling at the sound of a snarling dog
toby is curled up in the corner of the lifeboat teeth bared
she climbs in moving to her equally relieved dog mcculloch and miss van deusen right behind her
as sean jabs it and the hoist motor kicks in
just as a huge bolt of lightning cracks over the smoke stack and upper deck
jason steps out from behind it gaping down on them with frightening omnipresence
gripping the bloody axe
sean climbs in the boat as it continues to lower
he takes one look back at the ship and sees rapidly moving down the staircase towards them
seans view is cut off as the lifeboat sinks below deck level
as seans eyes dart around down to the sea up at the hoist
trampling towards the hoist about thirty feet away now
the boat has already disappeared over the edge
as the lifeboat continues to lower about ten feet from making contact with the tumultuous ocean
the ships hull is crooked and sinking
as he relentlessly moves to the hoist cable raising his axe
as the ship finally touches water and jasons axe blade chops the cable
and the hoist cable falls limply over them
jasons too late
sean looks up and sees standing by the hoist hovering over the edge
grabs an oar turning back to mcculloch
mcculloch takes the oar as miss van deusen holds onto rennie tightly the girls eyes squeezed shut
sean looks up at the ship again and jason is none
sean looks around with confusion as huge waves wind and rain pummel them
or is he
were moving towards the lifeboat at water level almost like a shark preparing for attack
sean breathes with some relief resuming his rowing with mcculloch
they get about three strokes apiece before lunges from under the ocean surface grabbing onto sean
but its julius gasping for oxygen spitting up seawater
sean pulls him over the edge
miss van deusen moves to help him and we the ship is gone now the lifeboat a speck in the ocean
the water is less rough now the rain replaced with fog
julius has taken mccullochs place behind an oar mcculloch is flanking his shivering niece with miss van deusen
miserable if we dont find the shore soon were all going to die
sean tries to ignore him keeping his mind on rowing
unable to hide fear do you know where we are sean
sean pauses utterly exhausted
he thinks for a moment remembering his fathers gift
sean reaches into his coat pocket removing the pocket navigational calculator
he stares at it long and hard
julius looks over at him seeing that sean is on the verge of tears
he grips his shoulder
hey man if i can make it so can
sean slowly nods turning on the calculator
as the lifeboat rows into frame the water relatively calm
mcculloch rennie and miss van deusen are asleep sean and julius rowing on sheer will power
sean takes one more stroke feels himself passing out then regains his coherence again
julius glances off the side of the ship for no particular reason then does a doubletake
they are rowing right past the statue of liberty illuminated in all its glory
julius feels his eyes widening and a huge smile taking control of his haggard face
he tugs on seans sleeve his eyes never leaving the monument
hey man wake up
check it out
the other stir as well opening their eyes not sure if its some kind of vision or if they are genuinely here
god damn were in new york
you did it my man
julius howls with delight miss van deusen hugging rennie as julius gives sean the high five
as the lifeboat rows toward the very famous skyline of manhattan twinkling in the near distance
we can hear the faint sound of julius singing new york new york relieved to be alive
theyre going to make it
as the sound of julius voice grows fainter
the water begins to ripple
then the top half of a hockey mask and swimming onward
as julius and sean row the lifeboat up to a narrow barge beneath deserted dock warehouses
they are not in the safest part of town by a longshot
as they climb onto the barge
rennie breathes with relief as she steps off the boat
she takes a final glance back at it and sees flailing her arms in the water right next to the lifeboat drowning
suddenly a decomposed hand reaches up from below she gazes in utter shock screaming no
they all follow her eyeline
but the water is calm nothing there
holding her its okay
youre safe now
mcculloch grits his teeth
come on everybody up the ladder
hes the first one up
sean looks at rennie concerned then hoists toby up in his arms
they all begin climbing the ladder
as the last pair of feet disappear over the top edge of the dock
camera pans back down the rungs finding the lifeboat and barge again
suddenly jason springs from the water climbing onto the barge
he gazes up at his new surroundings quite different from all the years hes spent at crystal lake
but an item at the far end of the dock causes him the longest pause
a tattered billboard over one of the warehouses advertises the new york rangers hockey team featuring a full shot of the hockey masked goalie
looks at it long and hard
he tears off his life preserver wits renewed ambition
as jason heads up the ladder
hes about to take manhattan
as our survivors head into an isolated foreboding group of dock warehouses and alleys
there must be a phone around here somewhere
a wonderful choice of places to dock a boat mr
sean looks away trying to keep from losing his temper
were spying on them from behind a stack of crates as they come in our direction
waiting for the right moment
as they move towards the stack of crates
without warning a pair of gang bangers jump out both holding guns
nervous young druggies
all hands go up
gang banger grabs mccullochs watch and wallet skimming through a wad of bills and credit cards while keeps them covered
got some good shit here holmes
eyeing rennie you got that right
he steps over to rennie brushing her hair back with the barrel of his revolver spotting the statue of liberty pendant sean gave her
now aint that sweet
he tears it off her neck pocketing it
sean angrily moves toward him and gang banger l shoves the barrel against rennies temple
go ahead superman
be a hero
sean has no choice but to freeze
julius flexes his fists but he too has gang banger s gun leveled on him
mcculloch stares at the thugs with obvious contempt
it doesnt go unnoticed
you got a problem dad
mcculloch offers some rare silence shaking a no to the gun toting kid
rennies dog begins to growl backing away ready to defend her
gang banger points his barrel at toby with zero conscience cocking back the hammer
she pushes his arm to the side just as the bullet as the bullet tears up asphalt next to the dogs paws
toby sprints off into the darkness
gang banger grabs rennie by the hair brutally jerking her head back
please dont hurt her
hurt this princess
beat would i do that
they cough out laughs
gang banger looks into rennies eyes his barrel still on her skin
you look like a party girl princess
howd you like to go on a date with me and my friend
if youre free that is
more phlegm filled laughs
he drags her away gang banger backing away with him with his gun still trained on the others
you follow and well blow her fuckin head off comprende
the others watch helplessly as rennie is abducted
we cant let those gang bangers get away man
julius starts to move after them
mcculloch grabs him
you heard him
we have to call the police julius jerks away from mccullochs grasp
but he knows mcculloch is right
everyone split up well cover more ground that way
i dont think thats such a safe idea my nieces life hangs in the balance right now
every second counts
no more rebuttal
they hurry off
its a narrow passageway between warehouses
decrepit brownstones with shattered chicken wire windows moss growing on the bricks
the gang bangers appear with rennie dragging her down some concrete steps
welcome to the casbah princess
pan around with them as they walk through a thick blanket of steam which pours out of a factory vent
we move through the mist with them revealing a tattered rain soaked couch and chair upholstery shredded
a spool once used for telephone wire functions as their coffee table
they splash through puddles throwing her down on the couch
looking back at the steam vent
jason appears in the as a yellowish liquid squirts out the dirty needle
widen to find gang banger holding it with transfixed eyes his compadre holding a squirming rennie down on the couch tearing back her jacket to reveal a bare arm
loosen up baby
itll feel way better if youre stoned
amongst the slime and cigarette butts is a discarded syringe
jason picks it up
just as gang banger jabs rennie with the needle
gang banger wrestles off his torn leather jacket pushing rennie back on the exposed foam padding as his friend watches excitedly
slang us some more caine jojo
were in for a long night
gang banger runs out the back way
tears open rennies blouse his filthy mouth moving to her neck
rennie spits in his face
he hesitates not in slapping its your parade princess
can be smooth or can be rough
her eyes trying to blot out whats about to happen
i think im in love
push in on his face as his neck arches down bringing his lips toward her chest
just before contact he grunts jason is standing right behind him shoving something into his back out of frame
he thrusts it again bringing with it one more horrific grunt from the kid
jason goes for number three and jasons syringe gets shoved completely through him the needle sticking out his front side
opens her eyes looking into the dead boys face as blood drips from his mouth
he collapses in front of her giving way to a view of jason towering over her
at the same time comes around the corner
forgot my money holmes
ha stops dead in his tracks at the sight of jason
who the fuck are you
jason paces toward him
the kid glances at his dead friend arched over the couch quickly whipping out his
youre dead fuckhead
but jason keeps on coming
five shots later and jasons still standing easily picking up the slime ball and shoving him head first into the mossy brick wall
the kid falls in a bloody heap
shoves gang banger off of her as jason returns his attention to her
she grabs a loose brick and flings it at him cracking his hockey mask momentarily disorienting him
rennie sprints away
as julius runs into view looking down a menacing alley spotting a phone booth
he hurries for it
like a cat watching a bird we watch julius head for the booth
slams open the booth door grabbing the receiver punching the operator digit
slowly push in on him as he waits for an answer
several more rings
finally a click and muffled words from the operator
get me the police this is an emergency
as jasons fist crashes through the booth window grabbing julius by the throat
julius grips jasons scaly arm with all his strength staring at the cracked hockey mask framed in the shattered window
julius summons all his strength tearing free of jasons grasp and running out the door
the phone is left dangling
with no apparent direction
literally running for his life
hes just as quick but smoother and more methodical
heading up the alley spotting a fire escape diverting his course straight for it
as julius leaps onto it dragging himself up climbing as fast as is humanly possible
but jason is far from human easily negotiating the wrought iron stairs and rapidly catching up
as julius head appears clawing his way onto the tar papered surface running to the opposite side
a second later jason hops up right behind him
as julius soon learns the awful truth that the only way up is the only way down
with the exception of a head splitting freefall
no way is he gonna jump
julius turns back to jason raising his fists psyching himself up for the fight of his life
he whispers to himself use the combos and keep the feet light
the fight begins man against monster each sizing the other up
jason takes the first swing julius deftly dodging him and countering with left right left combination
they have absolutely no effect
julius follows up with a round of kidney punches
julius finds himself being forced back against the rings which in this case is the edge of the roof
he risks a glance backwards and sees its a long rough way down
its do or die time
as julius slams punch after punch into jason forcing him back to the center of the rooftop spending every last ounce of his energy in doing so
he throws one more feeble punch knowing its his last
take your best shot motherfucker
jason gladly obliges winding up and recoiling with a punch none of us expected
gets literally knocked off his shoulders cascading off the edge of the rooftop and the decapitated head lands on a sloped roof below rolling down towards street level and falling
into a garbage filled dumpster
as rennie dizzily runs down the alley the effects of the drugs kicking in
blurry disoriented erratic
suddenly a figure jumps out its sean
he rushes to her sensing her disorientation
whatd they do to you
serious pause then jason came
hes here sean
he never expected this
we have to find the others
together they run off
as miss van deusen briskly walks below us far from relaxed in this threatening environment
she moves forward the only sound being her shoes against wet asphalt
four more steps then a dark out of focus freeze
rack focus to find a uniformed irish cop standing there service revolver raised
mcculloch steps out from the alcove as well recognizing miss van deusen
its okay shes with me
she turns around lowering her hands utterly relieved
my apologies miss
my units right over here
they head through an abandoned parking lot towards a concrete wall with stairs about six feet above the wall is an upper street where his patrol car is parked
they get halfway through the lot when they hear hey
as sean and rennie run to join them from the alley
mcculloch rushes to his niece
rennie thank god
but rennie goes to miss van deusen instead
its a bitter pill for mcculloch
jasons here in new york
dont be ridiculous
is it true rennie
she nods unable to repress her fear
is this the lass in question
hes a walking corpse a phantasm from hell
the others stare at mcculloch angrily
miss van deusen turns to the confused policeman
im afraid youll have some trouble believing us
so try me
parked above the abandoned garage the interior dark
the cop and our heroes appear in the background coming towards it
youre right i find it a tall tale indeed
but you seem like honest folks so im inclined to believe at least some of it
relieved thank you
the first thing we have to do is find julius
im sure hell pop up soon enough
why dont you climb in the back while i radio for backup
but even in this darkness we see that its empty
they climb in
the cop opens his drivers door and
the car dome light blinks on and
our four survivors faces are brightly illuminated instantly changing to gasps and screams because julius severed head is resting on the dash board staring back at them
reacting to their terror seeing julius head quickly grabbing the radio mike
but he has no time for a message because jason reaches up from the parking lot pit below grabbing the cops ankle dragging him down
the radio is still in his grasp
as the radio cord grows taut finally snapping
the irish cops awful yell echoes over it silencing after a sick thud
the foursome instantly try to flee the car but police cars have no door handles in the back
there arent any handles
cocaine flowing through her veins rennie acts hyperkinetically scratching her way over the seats just as appears at the parking lot stairs stalking straight there is no time for escape
rennie finds the ignition and fires it up jamming it into drive and stomping on the accelerator
julius head rolls off the dash onto the floorboards
her vision is still a stoned one but clear enough to set her target
we come straight at the abominable creature and jason is mowed down
slams on the brakes jerks it into reverse and floors it as the automobile grinds back over him a second time
stomps on the brake pedal and the tires screech to a halt
they all take a moment to catch their breath looking out the front window
jason lies dead on the asphalt
for about two seconds
he desperately throws it into forward again gripping the wheel and racing forward
jasons standing there for one second but the next moment he is leaping out of the way
and the squad car smashes through a chain link fence as the car bottoms out then swerves into a sharp right turn racing down the alley
as jason appears at the end of the alley blocking their retreat
as rennie stomps the brake pedal jerking it into reverse
as she backs up changes gears and races down an intersecting alley
speeding towards an escape when jason pops out again
hes everywhere all at once
slamming on the discs one more time flooring it into reverse
as the squad cars rear tires smoke and spin finally gripping pavement
as we fly backwards
and jason appears behind them
rennies terrified face filling it seeing that jason is in back of them
as they screech to a halt one final time rapidly rotating in the opposite direction and speeding out of frame
rennie is almost maniacal now her knuckles white around the vinyl wheel her foot practically mashed through the floorboard
rennie for gods sake slow down
she doesnt hear him or anything for that matter
her eyes remain straight ahead never blinking
theres a figure standing in the distance
but it looks too small to be jason
we rush towards it changing into slow motion just before impact
the figure is a dripping wet boy with a sinister smile
as the front of the squad car rams the brick wall head as the front passenger door is shoved open by sean who drags out rennie
mcculloch follows close behind helping sean carry her away from the wreckage over by a row of old oil drums filled with slime and rainwater
then it suddenly hits sean
miss van deusen
he takes two steps back to the car when the squad car interior is engulfed in a ball of flames
opens her dazed eyes seeing miss van deusens body charring inside the wreckage
she numbly gets to her feet stepping towards it
something makes her hesitate she peers down at the asphalt
a pool of gasoline has collected flames dancing across its glassy surface
suddenly a tiny rowboat dissolves in not unlike the lifeboat she was so afraid of
the rowboat glides across the surface of the burning gasoline two people riding in it
the flames and asphalt shimmering water clouds and pine trees reflected in it
the rowboat floats into view
the two occupants are young rennie and mcculloch
shes wearing a bathing suit and an innocent smile
and not an inkling of fear about the water
she stands letting the sun soak into her
what a beautiful day
perfect for a swim isnt it
she frowns at him looking away
youve been coming out here every summer for the last three years young lady and you still havent learned how
ill take some lessons this time
she bends over splashing the water
thats what you said last year
i think the time for your first swimming lesson has just come
the splashing stops
you dont want to end up drowning like that voorhees boy do you
shes instantly tense
he never learned how either and hes still at the bottom of this lake
he is not
oh he is indeed
and ready to pull down anybody who falls in and cant swim
youre telling a lie
lets find out
and quicker than shes able to react to it mcculloch as rennies body violently disrupts the calm surface
she immediately begins to flounder
mcculloch calmly leans over the edge
better swim before jason drags you down rennie
come on you can do it
but rennie thrashes in the water struggling to keep from sinking under the surface
her uncles face blurs and clears as water splashes her eyes
you can and you will
is too panicked to obey
she coughs on some water then disappears
the world above her ceases to exist murky lake water taking over
rennie looks down and to her horror
young jason is grabbing her ankle and dragging her down
the whole image bursts into flames and we as the gasoline continues to burn the rowboat gone
adjust to find rennies face the flames of the car wreckage flickering over her glassy eyes
she looks up at miss van deusens body one last time before the autos fuel tank explodes shrapnel flying she looks up at her uncle with knowing eyes
eyes that tell him shes remembered everything
you pushed me
defensively i was only trying to teach you
but i pulled you out rennie
i saved your life
rennie just stares incredulous
you son of a bitch
she lets it build until shes ready to explode
then he was down there
and rennie runs off
mcculloch starts to follow but sean grabs him shoving him down
you keep away from her
sean chases after rennie
camera methodically pans back to mcculloch crumpled on the ground
a very bitter man
he wipes his hands getting ready to stand when the shadow falls over him
his skin fades to porcelain white
but possible and actual he is
a pair of rotted arms as the walking corpse lifts a screaming mcculloch over his head carrying him over to one of the scum filled oil drums shoving him head
first into it
jason grips mccullochs thrashing legs as bubbles rise to the surface of the slime a pathetic gurgling reverberating out the drum
at last mccullochs appendages go limp
jason releases him moving on
as sean runs into view glancing around spotting rennie crouched against a crumbled brick wall
sean sits down next to her
after several moments
i was at school when they told me
rennie we have some very bad news
your parents have been killed in an auto accident
sean gently takes her hand sharing her internal agony
it seems like everybody i care about ends up
she cant finish
push in as sean kisses her on the forehead then makes her look into his eyes
not this time
he caresses her face it develops into a tender kiss
finally she holds him back letting it out
at the same time somebody is creeping at a low angle towards them
are lost in their shared quiet moment
until the growling sound becomes audible
they look up seeing cautiously approaching them
rennie stands absolutely relieved
she starts to move towards him and her dog snarls whats wrong boy
another protective growl then as jason stampedes through a stack of crates and garbage cans behind them
abruptly flee down the alley jason in mad pursuit
as rennie sean and the dog run straight towards us jason swiftly catching up
fast track with them over to a deserted rain slicked subway entrance
as they bang through the glass doors sailing past us
three beats later jason appears not bothering to open the door stampeding right through the glass
sean rennie and toby sail down the escalators past a few scattered commuters
again jason appears looming tall at the top
he starts down the up escalator
as an elderly couple rises toward us
their reactions grow more bleak the closer we get finally registering terror as we plow right through them
sean and rennie hop over a metal turnstile toby crawling under it
a ticket taker leans out his window shouting at them
the teenagers are soon forgotten as jason smashes through wheel right off its base
the ticket taker reacts speechlessly deciding not to press his luck
as sean and rennie slide up to the edge of the track pit seeing the lights of an approaching train which is taking too long to get there
but jason arrives before the train
toby barks and snarls trying to protect them
jason is unfazed
he treads toward them and leaps onto jason sinking his teeth into the monsters throat
jason wrestles the animal into submission just as streaks into the station
a fraction of time later heaves the dog in front of the train
shrieks in horror as toby disappears inside the pit just as the train roars by
theyre new yorkers but not callous enough to stomach this quickly scattering
even a group of severe skinheads decide they can wait for the next train quickly heading up the escalators after seeing jason in action
makes rennie look away dragging her with him along the platform edge in retreat as jason returns his attention to them
they reach the end of the platform having no choice but to board the front car
as the doors whoosh shut
but jason pries them open
the train engineer glances back from his booth seeing jason making the improper entry
hey pal you cant do that
a second later hes gotten a good look at jason
its too late for a retraction as jason savagely jams his head as the engineers arm knocks the throttle forward
and the train begins to move racing into the black tunnel
as rennie and sean run for their lives arriving at the end of a car jamming the separating doors open and entering the next car
jason follows right behind
as the train thunders through the station without stopping baffling several waiting commuters
seeing sean and rennie disappear through another connecting door
we storm our way through it into the next car right after them
a handful of travelers cower away from us
as the train rapidly speeds past us showing no signs of slowing down
as sean and rennie come through another set of separating doors rushing through
finding theyre in the last car
they look back seeing jason enter at the opposite end
the monster stalks forward
seans eyes dart around
he spots the emergency stop cord
he leaps for and the train screeches to a halt
the sudden stop throws jason on his back
sean throws the rear door open jumping out with rennie
as sean and rennie sprint down the center of the tracks toward the light of the next station running out of strength
as they emerge from the darkness up to the edge of the pit
sean boosts rennie up starting to climb up himself when fires out from the tunnel grabbing onto seans ankle
rennie screams as sean is dragged down
but he manages to latch onto a chain securing a garbage receptacle
jason pulls harder stretching sean to his limit as rennie watches helplessly
runs straight towards the track pit like a football punter recoiling with her right leg kicking jason trips backwards and lands on the third electrified rail receiving ten thousand volts
his body smokes and convulses finally sizzling out
he appears to be terminated
as they get to their feet holding each other tight looking down on the now dead undead creature
as our heroes arise into the neon filled big city wonderland relieved to be alive gazing around at the awesome spectacle known as times square
a huge digital clock tells us its a quarter to midnight
sean wraps his arm around her
its over rennie
its finally over
camera rises above them racking back to the subway exit
guess who has just made an encore
with more energy than ever
look all around them having never been to a city as big as this
they finally turn far enough around to spot jason in a series of three quick cuts each one closer than the last
but jason keeps on coming
somebody help us
hes going to kill us
but the heavy times square foot traffic ignores her bustling onward
rennie and sean have no choice but to flee again
shoves his way through the preoccupied pedestrians theyve certainly seen weirder characters than him here
he moves past a group of street urchins listening to some rap from their ghetto blaster
his foot obliterates their stereo system with one stride
they instantly pull out switchblades and chains
youre dead meat slime bag
jason stops turning around towering over the kids
he has blood and gore caked everywhere his skin charred from the electrocution
jason starts to remove his mask facing them squarely
as jasons mask comes off out of frame
their tough faces turn to putty scared completely shitless
hey man its cool its cool
they turn tail and race like the wind
jason steps forward so that were looking at the back of his head never seeing his naked face
he slips his hockey mask on again turns into a close up then exits
filled with noise smoke and derelicts
a tough redheaded waitress with a thick brooklyn accent stands behind the countertop a wall of mirrors behind her
the front door bangs open with the entrance of sean and rennie rushing up to the waitress
out of breath you have to call the police
a telephone sits right next to her but this is new york
theres a pay phone in back
they start to run
but its broken
you dont understand theres a maniac trying to kill us
blase welcome to new york
theres no time for further response as jason crashes them
sean and rennie run out the back as the waitress eyes jason with complete disbelief
as the burly chef comes out to confront him
jason flings picks up the telephone really pissed off
climbs off his counter stool revealing a huge bowie knife
jason plows straight for him and the biker stabs jason in the heart
jason has little reaction pulling it out tossing it aside
the bikers face goes wan backing away
stops in mid dial
fear is starting to register now
lifts the very large man and effortlessly heaves him into feels the phone receiver slipping from her grasp her mouth trembling
she backs away from the beast as far as she can
jason has no time to waste on her trampling out the back after rennie and sean as the other patrons shrink from him
as sean fumbles to unlock three deadbolts and two chains finally getting the back door open and springing into they run about ten yards before realizing the alley is a
sean and rennie start to head back the other way when jason mows out from the diner door
their vision scatters everywhere in search of a retreat
shes spotted a manhole cover slightly ajar
they havent the luxury of thinking about it sean sliding the cover back as jason comes forth
as they descend into hell
a massive chamber consisting of tall columns slimy catacombs and three feet of stagnant water
their alternatives are nil sean and rennie join hands wading through the swill splashing deeper into the labyrinth
as the dim streetlight glowing in the above world is eclipsed by jason making his way down after them
an oval tunnel slanted downward into pitch blackness
dim overhead lights illuminate salt deposits and eery rust formations
rennie and sean appear at the far end wading from the sewage as the tunnel rises toward us
as they come forward at a brisk but cautious pace strangers in a very strange land
sloshing through the slime
all is silent until seans foot trips over a barrel labeled hughes chemical plant
a vaporous green substance oozes out the rusty end of the container sizzling on the around
carefully sidestep it continuing on
they make it another ten yards when a figure leaps out from an alcove gripping a huge wrench
rennies scream echoes through the tunnel
but its a middle aged sanitation engineer who lowers the wrench as frightened as they are
what the hell are you kids doing down here
can you help us get out
i sure can and we dont have a minute to waste
he begins quickly packing up his tools
what do you mean
toxic waste son
this sewer floods out with the stuff on the th of every month right at midnight
checks watch and thats less than ten minutes from now
rennie looks down the dark tunnels in all directions swallowing hard
he clicks on his high powered flashlight and quickly leads them down no less threatening than the one they just left
when they pass a lightless intersecting corridor jason ejects rolls through the muck its beam splashing erratically across the polluted walls
begins bashing jasons head in with his wrench but the monster drags the kicking and screaming man into tunnel
tries to help up sean but hes been knocked into the opposite wall barely conscious
shes struck with indecisive shock looking into tunnel seeing jason arches his back with wrench in hand hammering it over and over into the sanitation engineers skull
backs away but does not run
the time has come to face her fears
as jason takes one more vengeful stroke finishing him off
he steps from tunnel with the scarlet coated tool his shadow becoming flesh
he moves straight for sean who has no hope for escape
jason cocks the wrench over seans skull
and suddenly his hockey mask is splashed with a bright light
jason stops turning directly into it
rennie is blinding us with the sanitation engineers flashlight giving us only brief glimpses of herself in the reflective wet surroundings
you never got me in the lake jason
and youre not going to get me now either
her voice is defiant
she carefully backstops the irritating light never leaving us
has been sufficiently taunted
he moves after her
as the bright beam leaves our eyes rennie dashing down the intersecting tunnel
stomping through the sludge picking up speed
hes wanted to kill rennie most of all
as rennie dashes up to the hughes chemical drum sean tripped over using the back end of the flashlight to crush in the cans rusted lid
the metal is flimsy but still resists her blows
she frantically hammers harder
hes moving like a freight train now an addict rolling after his fix
as the butt of the flashlight dents the metal ultimately causing it to cave in
looking through his unblinking eyes whipping into tunnel
where we catch a fleeting glimpse of rennie flinging the contents of the oil drum
a half second later a wave of gray green liquid flies at us
and his hockey mask is splashed with toxic waste seeping into his masks eye slits
he careens back as if her were a rabid dog receiving a load of point blank buckshot
drops the can fumbling for the flashlight again
as the radiant flashlight beam finds his mask the plastic beginning to bubble and melt
rush into a tight hideous face rotted flesh some of it sizzling from the chemical
worms slithering out his nostrils
and his eyes
or lack thereof
theyre like two raw quail eggs frying in liquid green pollutant
and the yolks just broke running down his face
as the beam begins to waver in her quivering grasp
rise to find rennies face reacting to the stomach turning sight of jasons visage
she grabs hold of her senses and as rennie skirts past the blinded creature whip pan with her as she turns down tunnel heading back toward sean
continue to quickly pan around until weve come around degrees and are back on jason in no way ready to give up
he staggers after rennie
as rennie skids up to sean still dazed
she grabs him shaking hard
get up sean
his eyes blink only half coherent
then an inconceivable terror registers in her ears
a low deep rumbling sound coming from up ahead
her head jerks in the direction of her planned retreat an ominously empty tunnel soon to be filled with the unthinkable
the sound of rushing liquid is growing at leaps and bounds
as her trembling chin rises looking at the dim overhead lights are beginning to vibrate from the approaching flood
rotates her head and sees vision or no vision he is lurching towards her relentlessly
she is literally sandwiched between hell and high water
drags sean to his feet with the strength of a possessed woman pulling him over to a service ladder attached to the intersecting alcove wall
she shoves him up it from below sean summoning everything hes got to obey her
rennie shoots a stare back down the tunnel
the overhead lights are banging around like an earthquake has just hit the liquid will be arriving any second
her vision whip pans degrees to find jason approaching from the opposite end groping around with his scaly arms like the claws of a roto tiller
as rennie starts up after sean looking down and seeing within ten feet of them shifting directly for the ladder like hes working on some kind of radar
slips on the rusty ladder regaining her footing
and rushing higher
she takes her final glance into the tunnel the ultimate horror registering in her corneas as she sees a million gallons of green brown toxic waste splash into the far
intersection filling the tunnel flooding has just started to climb the ladder when the wind and smell of the rushing toxic waste bombards him
his decomposed head swivels to face tons of lethal sewage stopping for no one
arriving in seconds
he doesnt need vision to confirm what his other senses already know
jasons mouth begins to quaver
and the mmmmmmmmmommy
dont let me drown camera speeds toward his gaping mouth and down his throat as lightning arcs off his mucous covered insides
we sink deeper into his guts fire and smoke flaring into our eves eventually coming to a well in the pit of his stomach filled with blood
and eight year old jason is hhhhelp me
a split second later the wall of deadly toxic liquid engulfs jason
the powerful flood thrashes the ladder about two inches below rennies feet the force of it fiercely shaking their rusty support
they are clinging to the ladder with their eyes squeezed shut
praying for survival
we are drowning in a chunky cloud of sewage rushing over and under us
the digital clock we saw earlier abruptly chimes as the sewage level begins to drop
rennie opens her eyes glancing straight down and seeing
the ladder beneath them reappears
which gives way to a pair of hands gripping the bottom rung
the liquid drops further unshrouding the now dead corpse of eight year old jason
hes a relatively normal looking boy probably the way he looked back in
right when he drowned in crystal lake
jason voorhees has finally been put to rest
rennie and sean stagger out from a side street holding each other up
relief etched in their matured faces
i hear theres a statue here thats stories tall
rennie would smile if she could
she kisses his cheek
they amble on
coming out from another alley creeping up behind them through a crowd of pedestrians
about the height of a small child
walk arm in arm exhausted and oblivious to their pursuer
but something some innate perception causes rennie to slow
her eyes register a horrid fear and she whips around to face
limping on all fours filthy with grease matted fur
the whimpering dog crawls up to her rennie bending down hugging her animal like shell never let go
as sean bends down too ruffling the dogs fur standing again with rennie
the three survivors enter the collage of pedestrians bright lights and skyscrapers
it is finally over
