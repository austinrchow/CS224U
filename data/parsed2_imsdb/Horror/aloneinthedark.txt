written by elan mastai michael roesch a dense forest on a dark misty night
young edward carnby age small thin and terrified runs for his life
the forest is pitch black
young edward ducks between trees under branches not stopping for anything gasping for breath
he doesnt turn to look behind him
he just runs as fast as he can
tomething chases young edward through the dark forest
is skewed inhuman
it is gaining on him
as young edward runs beams of light become visible through the closely packed trees
something is up ahead something bright
edward runs towards it
young edward bursts out into a clearing in the woods running towards the bright light
the light stops whatever is chasing young edward at the edge of the forest
what is making the light isnt visible only young edwards silhouette running towards the blinding light
the beams of a dozen flashlights cut through the mist of the dark forest
a dozen uniformed deputies move through the forest shining their flashlights around searching
the trees tower over them
a low fog hangs in the air
the flashlight beams can barely penetrate it
a large and stately old house stands on the edge of town
a small dense forest stretches out behind it
the sign on the front reads our lady of perpetual light
several patrol cars are parked along the orphanages gravel driveway
deputies mill around the front lawn
another patrol car pulls up
out of it steps the sheriff late s
deputy adams mid s approaches him
whats going on adams
twenty kids live at this orphanage sheriff
all twenty have gone missing
sister clara mid s an anxious looking nun stands on the front porch wrapped in a shawl
she speaks with two deputies
the sheriff walks up and listens in
after the power went out i went to check on the children
but their beds were empty
every one of them
they just disappeared
the deputies sweep through the forest with their flashlights
the trees are close together blocking out the moonlight
a thick mist hangs in the trees
as deputy adams moves through the forest he sees a bright light streaming through the trees up ahead
deputy adams comes through the trees and emerges into a clearing in the woods
he sees a shed in the clearing up ahead
a bright light is posted over the sheds front entrance
deputy adams shines his flashlight around the outside of the shed
he sees that the door is open just a crack
on the door is a sign marked danger along with the symbol for electricity
deputy adams enters the shed
the shed is small packed with electrical equipment power cables and various implements for repairing power lines
deputy adams sweeps through the shed with his flashlight
he approaches a large transformer module that sits at the back of the shed
it hums and crackles with electricity
theres a low shuffling sound
deputy adams stops
he carefully peers around behind the transformer
the space is too small for a full size person
but sitting on the ground behind the transformer is young edward
he clutches himself shivering frightened
the sheriff stands with his deputies
his walkie talkie crackles to life
i found one
white male about ten years old
looks to be unharmed
hes in a utility shed maybe half a mile from the orphanage
deputy adams approaches young edward
he takes off his jacket and wraps it around young edwards shoulders
young edward pulls the jacket around him and smiles still scared but happy to see the deputy
are you okay son
are the other kids around here
i dont know
i dont remember
why dont we start with your name
do you remember your name
edward carnby early s lean and intense wakes up
he quickly looks around to get his bearings
he sits in a large commercial airplane
the compartment is full of seated passengers
small boy age sits next to carnby looking up at him
the small boys mother early s sleeps next to him
did you have a nightmare
carnby looks at the small boy curious
he doesnt respond
you ate cheese with dinner
my mommy says cheese gives you nightmares
want to see my coloring book
the small boy has a halloween themed coloring book open on his lap
its a graveyard scene full of cartoon drawings of ghosts werewolves and vampires
i think theres a vampire living in my closet but my mommy says vampires and ghosts arent real
she says theres nothing to be afraid of in the dark
carnby weighs what hes going to say
your mother is wrong
being afraid of the dark is what keeps most of us alive
the small boys eyes open wide
everybody else tells me not to be afraid
thats because they dont know the truth
carnby exits the terminal and heads over to a row of taxis waiting outside the terminal
he doesnt carry a suitcase
so maybe youre thinking im an asshole trying to scare this poor kid for no reason
but thats where youre wrong
because ive got my reasons
theres a world around you that youve trained yourself not to see
youve willfully closed your eyes
but your fear of the dark is not a weakness
its there to protect you from things youd better pray you never see
my eyes were forced open a long time ago
now i know
just because you cant see something doesnt mean it cant kill you
carnby steps into the first taxi waiting in the row
the taxi shifts into gear and drives off
another taxi is parked up ahead
as carnbys taxi passes it the second taxi pulls out and follows it
behind the wheel of the taxi sits james pinkerton early s
his face is drawn grim
he wears dark sunglasses
the driver lies dead in the backseat of pinkertons taxi
carnbys taxi can be seen through the front windshield driving up ahead
the two taxis drive through traffic
pinkertons taxi lags a few cars back but matches carnbys taxi move for move
the cabbie late s manic bordering on crazy steers through traffic
carnby rides in the backseat
he looks out the back windshield
a few cars back pinkertons taxi follows them
carnby takes a burlap sack out of his trench coat pocket
inside the sack is a stone carving of a demonic looking head
the edges are soft worn down the detail roughed away
but it is clearly not a human face
carnby puts the carving back in his trench coat pocket
you travel light
trust me im carrying enough baggage for the both of us
the cabbie chuckles as he steers through traffic
thats pretty funny man
what do you do
you really want to know
hearing about my passengers lives keeps the job interesting
im a paranormal investigator
get the fuck outta here
what does that mean exactly
im an effective solution to unusual problems
carnby turns to look out the back windshield
pinkertons taxi is still following from a few cars back
speaking of which that taxis been following us since the airport
want me to lose him
if you can
the cabbie guns the motor and speeds off
carnbys taxi accelerates down the street pulling away from pinkertons taxi
as soon as its evident that they are on to him pinkertons taxi speeds up to give chase
the two taxis rocket down the streets swerving past cars screeching around corners
carnbys taxi speeds down the streets narrowly avoiding collisions with other cars and pedestrians
pinkerton just plows through whatevers in his way smashing past other cars forcing pedestrians to jump out of the way
pinkerton accelerates and tries to force carnbys taxi off the road
the taxis grind against one another
carnbys taxi screeches around a corner speeding into a side street that leads to the market street
a busy street crowded with pedestrians open shops and produce stalls
carnbys taxi races down the busy market street followed by pinkerton
they swerve and screech down the street cutting off other cars and narrowly avoiding pedestrians
but then pinkertons taxi zooms up beside carnbys taxi and bumps into it with a grinding crush of metal
not stopping pinkertons taxi continues to grind into carnbys taxi
the momentum pushes carnbys taxi around sideways
pinkertons taxi then slams carnbys sideways taxi into a parked car with a crush of metal and shattering glass
theres a moment as carnby trapped inside the crushed taxi and pinkerton flooring the accelerator to add more pressure exchange a look
pinkertons expression is fierce
pinkerton gears the taxi into reverse backing up in order to smash into carnbys taxi again
the cabbie is trapped by the crushed front of the taxi
his face is covered with a spiderweb of deep cuts
the cabbie struggles to get loose
im trapped man
ill draw him away
as pinkertons taxi backs up it crashes into a van driving by knocking it over onto its side and spilling the contents of the van onto the street
this gives carnby the brief moment he needs to extract himself from the crushed taxi
he wrenches himself out the window just in time to see pinkertons taxi accelerating towards him
carnby bolts away from the crushed taxi and the trapped cabbie
pinkerton immediately swerves his taxi aiming it right for the running carnby
pinkertons taxi rockets towards him
carnby leaps out of the way as pinkertons taxi crashes into the side of a building narrowly missing him
pinkertons taxi is crumpled in a crash of metal and glass
carnby narrowly avoids being crushed between the taxi and the building
with fluid grace carnby rolls to safety landing on his feet
with a quick look back over his shoulder at pinkerton in his crumpled taxi carnby runs
pinkerton steps out of his taxi seemingly unhurt by the crash
he looks around but cant see carnby anywhere on the street
pinkerton runs for an iron wrought staircase that leads up to a pedestrian bridge that hangs over the street
at the top of the pedestrian bridge pinkerton looks up and down the street
he spots carnby running through the crowd of pedestrians
pinkerton leaps off the pedestrian bridge arcing through the air with superhuman force
pinkerton tackles the running carnby to the ground slamming into him with a tremendous impact
but carnby is quick
he takes the hit and spins pinkerton around with a martial arts kick
the kick sends pinkerton crashing through the front window of a bakery
pinkerton comes crashing through the display window landing in a pile of sticky buns and broken glass
but seemingly unfazed he just picks himself up and walks back out the front door
carnby stands in a crowd of bystanders watching in surprise as pinkerton exits the bakery his expression fierce
pinkerton immediately spots carnby and comes after him
carnby bolts away running into a herbalist store across the street
jars of different shapes and sizes containing a variety of medicinal herbs and other such substances are on display
carnby runs into the herbalist store making his way through the displays
pinkerton leaps right through the herbalist stores front display window in a hail of shattered glass
he tackles carnby crashing through the jars on display
pinkerton slams carnby to the ground
he grabs carnbys head and smashes it against the floor once then twice
pinkerton tears open carnbys trench coat
he pulls out the burlap sack
he opens the sack confirming the stone carving is inside it
while pinkerton inspects the stone carving carnbys hand quietly moves to a large glass jar lying next to them
carnby smashes the glass jar over pinkertons face
he grabs the stone carving out of pinkertons hand scrambles to his feet and runs
carnby bursts out of the herbalist stores back door exiting out into a small cluttered alley
carnby lands hard in the debris but he rolls with the fall and is back up on his feet running
the alley ends in a high wall with a billboard on top of it
the wall has a railing along one side
carnby vaults over the railing and keeps running
the alley is crowded with workers unloading crates out of the loading dock of the ice factory
a beat cop walks by
carnby runs past the beat cop just barely bumping into him
but as carnby passes him he deftly grabs the beat cops gun from his holster
the beat cop doesnt even notice his gun is missing as he turns annoyed to see carnby racing away
pinkerton runs out of the herbalist stores back door
he runs directly at the high wall
pinkerton leaps up scrambling right up the side of the wall
he hauls himself up the billboard until hes standing at the top of the billboard itself
pinkerton looks down below and spots carnby running into the loading dock of the ice factory
pinkerton leaps off the billboard
the beat cop looks up stunned to see pinkerton leaping towards him
pinkerton lands on top of a moving dolly of crates crushing the crates on it
the worker pushing the dolly falls back shocked
pinkerton leaps off the dolly and keeps chasing after carnby
the beat cop fumbles for his gun
its not there
pinkerton smashes the beat cop out of the way as he pursues carnby
the beat cop flies into a pile of crates knocked out
pinkerton follows carnby into the ice factory
the refrigerated ice factory is filled with neat rows of ice blocks
factory workers mill about transporting the blocks of ice through the factory
carnby hides between the rows of ice blocks
he checks the beat cops gun to make sure its loaded
carnby stops sensing something
in one fluid motion carnby suddenly spins turning in the other direction and firing the gun
we follow the bullet as it rockets through the ice factory
it whizzes along until we see carnbys intended target
pinkerton comes through the ice factory running at carnby
the bullet flies directly at him
the bullet hits pinkerton in the shoulder
but it only seems to anger pinkerton further
he keeps running at carnby
pinkerton leaps at carnby
carnby fires again
but pinkerton dodges the bullet and it hits a block of ice shattering it in a hail of ice shards
pinkerton rolls with his dodge and races off into the stacks of ice blocks
carnby tries to track pinkertons movements through the ice stacks
he hears the sound of pinkerton moving but cant see him
his gun is ready
he searches around
suddenly theres a rush of movement behind him
carnby dodges just as pinkertons fist comes flying out
pinkerton connects with an ice block shattering it
carnby is backed into a dead end in the ice factory
he turns to face pinkerton gun ready
but pinkerton is on him too quickly
he lunges at carnby hoisting him over his head and slamming him down on a conveyer belt
pinkerton drags carnby along the conveyer belt
but carnby grabs a hanging chain to steady himself
with a quick kick carnby uses the momentum to flip pinkerton over him
pinkerton flies through the air towards a large ice pick wedged into the wall
the sharp point of the ice pick punches right through pinkertons torso impaling him
he is immediately killed
carnby leans up against the wall steadying himself
he pulls the stone carving out of his pocket to check it
in the fight the carving has been cracked into pieces
but the broken carving reveals something hidden inside it a small gold artifact that was concealed in the carving
the artifact is a gold circle flat on the top and bottom its thick round side engraved with intricate abkani symbols
this is the lynchpin artifact the piece which connects the other artifacts together
the elegant museum of natural history
a wide staircase leads up to an entranceway surrounded by stone pillars
over the front of the museum hangs a large banner reading the high ceilinged main hall of the museum
glass display cases are set up to showcase archeological artifacts
aline cedrac late s studious but dynamic stands in front of a display case
she carries a clipboard
a heavy set guard early s approaches followed by a delivery guy late s who hauls in a crate on a dolly
got another delivery ms
aline checks her clipboard
i dont have anything scheduled
what museum was it transferred from
the delivery guy reads the information on his clipboard
hudgens from dr
its probably an error
it must be for the big abkani show
what the hells abkani
ancient native american civilization
they were this super advanced culture but something like ten thousand years ago they just disappeared
youve been reading up
not much else to do around here at night
aline picks up a crowbar and approaches the crate
says here its not to be opened by anyone but dr
this is aline cedrac
shes the assistant curator
weve got abkani artifacts coming in from museums around the world
until hudgens gets back im doing all the cataloguing anyway
aline pries open the lid of the crate with the crow bar
out of the packing foam aline lifts up a heavy stone tablet carved with elaborate abkani symbols
aline holds it up fascinated
where is hudgens anyway
the show opens in a few days
off on another archeological goosechase
he thinks hes finally found the erebus
so he sticks you with the work
at least it keeps your mind off your boyfriend
aline pleasant expression suddenly turns awkward
ill be in my office if you need me
aline quickly walks off taking the stone tablet with her
what was that all about
i shouldnt have said that
her boyfriends been missing for the last three months
delivery guy shakes his head at the guard
nice going jack ass
a large ship out on the open sea
crewmen scurry around the deck attending to a huge crane that hangs over the side of the ship
chains leads from the crane into the water
lionel hudgens mid s wiry and severe with a sharp intelligence stands on the deck with captain chernick late s
they look down at the water
they say a sunken ship is like a grave
it should never be disturbed
ive been searching for the erebus for twenty years captain
now that ive found it im afraid your ill informed superstitions arent enough to stop me
two divers in high tech newt suits break the surface
they signal to captain chernick
hudgens nods to captain chernick
bring it up
captain chernick signals to his crewmen
the crane is engaged
the chains run through the mechanism of the crane pulling something to the surface
the crane groans under the weight
captain chernick looks nervous as the crane shudders with the strain
out of the ocean the crane raises a large heavy container
the container is about eight feet long
it is battered and damaged by the ocean water and covered in barnacles
carnby unlocks the multiple locks on the front door to his loft and enters
as carnby walks through the loft he passes his answering machine
the messages indicator blinks
carnby presses the button to retrieve his messages
edward john here
hope things went well wherever you were this time
and please do not i repeat do not tell me about it
every time you tell me about your latest case i get nightmares for a week
anyway give me a call when you get back
linda wants to have you by for dinner
lord knows why but she seems to like you
and if you havent scared aline away yet bring her along
the loft is a large incredibly cool looking space
in one corner is a lab area filled with high tech scientific equipment
at another work station dozens of drawings maps and photos are spread out next to a flat screen computer
a few photos are tacked to a corkboard
several bookshelves all crammed with books line one wall
a old framed photograph sits on a bookshelf a faded photo of twenty children sitting on the front steps of the orphanage
sister clara stands with them
young edward sits to one side
a weapons cabinet features racks lined with guns and blade weapons
in another corner is a work out area
the sleek modern kitchen and living quarters are in another corner
the bed is set up against a wall of large windows
outside the windows the sun is setting
approaching the lab area carnby takes out the lynchpin artifact
he turns it around in his fingers watching the light glint off it
the ship is docked at a mist enshrouded pier
overhead lights along the dock illuminate the area
a transport truck is parked on the dock just next to the ships loading ramp
in front of the ramp five crewmen with automatic weapons stand guard smoking and looking vigilant
standing on the ships wide deck captain chernick looks impatient
hudgens stands over the large barnacle covered container
the container is secured with a heavy rusted lock
two large muscular men the first mate and crewman barnes check the chains connecting the container to the huge crane on the deck
they are preparing to load it onto the truck on the dock
dont you want to open it
make sure its what youre looking for
the conditions must be perfect
otherwise there will be
captain chernick steps up to the barnacle covered container
he notices that a section of the barnacles have gotten scraped off in the transport
under the barnacles the container is revealed to made of gold
chernick look startled
captain chernick rubs the gold spot on the container and looks closely at it
is this made of solid gold
did you know the abkani were the first civilization to use gold for their valuables
they believed it held the power to contain evil spirits
thousands of years later we dont even remember why gold was valuable to us in the first place
now lets load it onto the truck
captain chernick exchanges a look with the first mate and crewman barnes
they both give him a subtle nod
carnby sits in his lab area studying the lynchpin artifact under an illuminated magnifying lamp
the computer runs an analysis of the symbols carved into the artifact
the symbols flash by
the computer beeps ready
it has isolated the origins of the symbols
they are abkani
carnby looks over at a photo tacked to the corkboard next to the work station
the photo is of carnby and aline
the office is cluttered with books maps diagrams and strange artifacts
along one wall are several ceiling high shelving units each containing rows of drawers
the drawers hold artifacts from the museums collection
aline inspects the stone tablet
she speaks into a tape recorder like a coroner recording an autopsy
the pictograms are late period abkani
it seems to be some sort of
shadows that make ghosts of men
the world of light consumed by darkness
this is the first indication ive ever seen that the abkani had a myth about the end of the world
captain chernick approaches hudgens at the container
the first mate and crewman barnes stand quietly behind them
if the containers made of gold whatevers inside must be worth a fortune
you have no idea
chernick pulls out a pistol
but im looking forward to finding out
chernick smacks hudgens across the face with his pistol
hudgens gives chernick a grim look
i suppose one should not be surprised when mercenaries act mercenary
rewman barnes grabs hudgens and twists his arms behind his back incapacitating him
the first mate pulls out a revolver and points it right at hudgens face
captain chernick wedges a crowbar into the containers lock
youre making a terrible mistake
the only mistake would be letting you walk out with whatevers in there
crewman barnes smashes hudgens head against the container
hudgens is dazed from the blow
throw him in there
crewman barnes throws the dazed hudgens into a storage room built onto the deck
he slams the thick metal door closed
the door has a small glass covered peephole built into it
chernick pries open the lock with the crowbar
chernick hands the first mate the crowbar and he jams it into the handle of the door wedging it closed
hudgens struggles to his feet
he bangs on the door trying to pull it open
dont open it
the first mate and crewman barnes watch in fasciation as captain chernick prepares to open the gold container
lets see what all the fuss is about
he opens the container
with a deep sigh the vacuum of dry air escapes
carnby sits in front of his computer
he scans through screens of information relating to abkani civilization
carnby suddenly winces in intense pain
he clutches his head staggering to his feet
he knocks over a desk lamp and a chair as he stumbles back
grabbing his head and trying to shake off the pain carnby collapses unconscious to the floor
he is out cold
on the work station the lynchpin artifact starts to glow
john houghton early s lies asleep in his bed next to his wife linda houghton early s
suddenly john opens his eyes
john quietly sits up and gets out of bed
linda is woken up but just barely
john walks out of the room
linda rolls over and falls back asleep
john exits the house
he walks down the front path and out into the night
carnby lies unconscious on the floor
the lynchpin artifact glows brightly emitting a low hum
a low wind wafts through the main hall
air flows through the space swirling dust along the floor
a banner hanging from the ceiling ripples from the breeze
aline sits at her desk her back to the shelving units
she inspects the stone tablet and takes notes
in one of the shelving units a faint glow emanates out of a closed drawers
something in another drawer begins glowing
then the contents of a third drawer start to glow
out of the three drawers a low hum is emitted
aline looks up tilting her head to hear the low humming
she turns around to face the shelving units
she is surprised to see the strange glow coming out of the three drawers
she cautiously approaches the shelving units
she reaches a hand out to open the first glowing drawer
as the first mate and crewman barnes watch in anticipation captain chernick opens the gold container all the way
the container is empty
the lights along the deck start to flicker
the lights in the storage room start to flicker on and off
hudgens looks up at the lights
theyre faster than i thought
he lights continue to flicker
captain chernick turns to the storage room door
he looks back at the first mate and crewman barnes
the first mate and crewman barnes pull out revolvers
they approach the storage room door
theres a whoosh of movement behind them
the three men all turn surprised
but nothing is there
suddenly captain chernick is thrown back by something invisible
he is hoisted into the air
he looks shocked
captain chernick seems to be floating just above the ground although it is clear something invisible is holding him up
the first mate and crewman barnes look on stunned their revolvers aimed at the floating captain
captain chernicks body contorts as if something had been thrust into it
with a burst of blood a hole is ripped into his torso killing him
captain chernicks lifeless body is dropped to the ground
terrified the first mate and crewman barnes aim their revolvers at the empty air
they open fire
hudgens stands at the door listening to the gunfire
he looks through the peephole in the door
the peephole is dirty hard to see through
something frantic is happening outside the door but its hard to see exactly what
there is more gunfire and then screaming
short bursts of automatic gunfire follow and more screaming
and then all is quiet
hudgens grabs a discarded metal rod and jams it into the door handle wedging it closed
he backs away from the door
the only weapon he can see is a box cutter
he grabs it holding it out in front of him
suddenly theres a crash at the door
something pushes at the door trying to get in
the door rattles and thumps from the impact
hudgens still holding the box cutter strains against the door using all the effort he can muster to keep it shut
the metal rod wedged against the door is starting to buckle
suddenly the door is still
theres a crash as another impact hits the door
the racket is even more intense
but the door holds
finally the thrashing stops
all is quiet again
the lights in the storage room stop flickering
they come back on
hudgens listens straining to hear anything at all
cautious hudgens pulls away the metal rod
he gingerly touches the door
with a long creak it slowly swings open
the crowbar was shaken loose from all the impacts
hudgens steps out of the storage room
he looks around the deck
mist blows in off the water
the night is quiet
bodies lie everywhere captain chernick the first mate crewman barnes the other crewmen
their weapons lie next to their slashed ripped open bodies
bullet holes are pocked around the deck
streaks of blood are smeared everywhere
shell casings and corpses are all that remain of the battle
tense carefully looking around hudgens walks up to the empty gold container
he reaches into it pressing a concealed panel at the back of the container
the panel opens revealing a small artifact
the artifact is a thin hollow cylinder with a thick little protrusion on one end
it is covered in abkani symbols
hudgens takes out the artifact
he turns it around in his hand
he looks pleased
everything in bureau s headquarters looks sleek and high tech
there are no windows anywhere
commander burke late s strides purposefully down the hallway
he is confident to the point of arrogance
his second in command agent miles mid s driven and efficient hurries to keep up
his better be good miles
sir were getting some strange readings in the control room
his is bureau
strange doesnt even crack my radar
now whats the situation
well sir normal levels of paranormal activity range from three to five
condescending yes miles
and what level are the sensors picking up now
burke and miles arrive at the control room
burke nods to two bureau guards standing at the entrance
we dont know
burke stops and looks at agent miles for the first time
they only go up to
agent miles opens the door to the control room
inside the control room the banks of monitors and sensors are all lit up
streams of data flow across the monitors
burke and miles stand at the doorway
agent krash krashinsky mid s a cool and collected female tech geek scans through data on the monitors
she always wears a headset
what are we looking at krashinsky
electromagnetics off the scale commander
agent yonek a control room techie adjusts the sensors
recalibrating sensors now sir
burke looks concerned for the first time
young edward age walks through the den
the lights are all out
the den is musty but clean
a sliver of light glows from underneath the doorway to sister claras bedroom
young edward knocks softly on the door
sister clara opens the door
she wears her nightgown
still having trouble sleeping edward
you cant stay up all night you know
sister somethings happened
what is it edward
theyre not gone anymore
the others are back
sister clara throws open the door to one of the childrens bedrooms
ten beds are lined up along the wall
all ten of them have children asleep in them
sister clara gasps holding her hand to her mouth
carnby lurches awake
he is still lying on the floor
his cellphone is ringing
carnby gets to his feet rubbing his temples trying to get his bearings
he answers his cell
edward thank god
linda whats wrong
hysterical its john
i woke up and
hes just gone
all his clothes are here
his cars in the garage
its like he just got up in the middle of the night and walked out
linda stands on the front porch her eyes red from crying
carnby is just leaving
he holds some recent photos of john
ill figure this out linda
ill find john
carnby moves to leave
youve known each other since you were kids
did he tell you he was leaving me
of course not
then where is he edward
whats going on
the orphanage looks much the same after twenty years
it is slightly more worn down but still well maintained
arnby drives up the gravel driveway in his black suv
he pulls to a stop behind an old battered yellow school bus
from a window on the ground floor sister clara now mid s watches him
a few children play on the orphanages front lawn
they all look over at carnby curious eager
carnby exits his suv
he looks around at the orphanage grounds as he walks up the front steps
he smiles at the children
sister clara opens the front door
sophie age stands with her eyeing carnby suspiciously
welcome home edward
should i make some tea
thank you sophie
sophie sneaks a look back at carnby as she enters the house
sister clara approaches carnby smiling warmly
let me get a look at you
are you sleeping enough
john disappeared last night
and something happened to me as well
sister claras expression drops
its happening again
a young girl age runs up to them
she hides behind sister clara staring up at carnby curious a little scared
carnby smiles at the young girl and she ducks behind sister clara
but then she sticks her face out to watch him again
i need your help sister
i need to find the others
ill get their files
carnby is on the phone sitting in front of his computer
while he speaks he reads information on the federal missing person database
the computer processes information
ill let you know as soon as i hear something
carnby hangs up the phone
carnby has a list of nineteen names the grown up orphans from his orphanage
next to each name carnby has written a note
fourteen are missing
five are unaccounted for so far
carnby writes a note next to the second to last name on the list
four now unaccounted for
on the work station is a stack of the orphanages worn out old file folders
each file matches a name on the list
the database finishes processing
it has found a match
a missing person report flashes onscreen
its the final name of the list
carnby makes a note next to the name
carnby hits print and the report comes out of the printer
he adds it to a small stack of similar reports
each report has a photo of a missing orphan both male and female
one of the photos is of john houghton
sixteen are missing
three are unaccounted for
the outdoor patio of a downtown restaurant
carnby sits with a coffee and a cherry pie at a table for two
agent paul fischer mid s precise but friendly approaches the table and sits down across from carnby
why did i agree to this
a waiter walks up
he puts down a plate of pecan pie in front of fischer
the waiter smiles and walks away
i ordered for you fischer
fischer gives carnby a smirk
youve got a good memory carnby
fischer takes a bite of the pecan pie
fischer pulls out a file and slides it across the table
carnby opens the file
inside it are photos and reports on the three remaining orphans from carnbys list
i tracked down the three you asked about
they all disappeared last night
just up and walked out in the middle of the night
that means all nineteen are missing
i ran full cross references
nothing much in common between them
except they all grew up in the same orphanage
whats going on carnby
thats what im trying to find out
carnby gets up to leave
he picks up the file
its good to know ive still got friends at
as the sun sets the streetlights around the museum all come on in unison bathing the area in a warm glow
the lights are all on in the museum
aline sits at her desk notes spread out in front of her
the notes show various abkani symbols
she writes down comments in the margins
the phone rings
aline answers it
did a shipment arrive for me today
its a fascinating piece dr
i started decoding the pictograms and
interrupting who told you to do that
that crate was not to be opened
i was only going to catalogue it for you
its not your place to question my instructions ms
leave the tablet alone
ill catalogue it myself when i get back
hudgens i was just
but hudgens has already hung up
aline looks at the receiver frustrated
she hangs up the phone
she looks up tilting her head to hear footsteps approaching
the guard knocks on the open door
somebody here to see you
aline exits quickly out of a service door looking anxious
the guard scurries after her
carnby stands in front of the security desk
aline runs up and embraces carnby
she holds him tightly
aline lets go
they hold eye contact
then aline rears back and punches carnby in the face
carnby takes the hit rubbing his jaw
i missed you too
i thought you were dead you asshole
let me explain
carnby looks over at the guard
the guard pretends to read his newspaper
give me one reason why id ever want to speak to you again
carnby reaches into his pocket and takes out the lynchpin artifact
aline stares down at it immediately fascinated
five minutes aline
ill tell you everything
carnby stands with aline at her desk while she scans a d rendering of the lynchpin artifact into her computer
i was in the amazon for six weeks tracking poachers through their transport lines
then i fell in with a group of ex chilean military selling artifacts on the black market
this was found in a gold mine in the southern tip of chile
and how did you end up with it
i asked very nicely
aline looks up at carnby
you shouldve called edward
just to let me know you were alive
aline picks up the lynchpin artifact inspecting it
she runs her fingers over the abkani symbols carved into it
does it make any sense to you
yesterday maybe not
but something happened last night
aline and carnby stand at a work station
a piece of cloth covers up something on the work station
line pulls back the cloth revealing three abkani artifacts
each of the three artifacts is a gold ring one small and thin one medium and slightly thicker and one large
the large ring is shaped like a pyramid with the top cut off and has thin protrusions on its base
each of the ring artifacts is well worn from age and engraved with abkani symbols
aline puts the lynchpin artifact down next to the others
they were found in completely different locations
and now this ones from chile
ten thousand years ago it wouldve been like burying them at the ends of the earth
aline picks up the lynchpin artifact again
she runs her fingers over one symbol in particular carved into the flat top of the artifact the dark spirit
the abkanis written language is based on pictograms
combinations of symbols to create different meanings
but theres one here ive never seen before
he lights in the office start to flicker
in unison the computer monitors all go dark
carnby pulls out a flashlight and flicks it on
youre not trying to seduce me are you
give me that
aline grabs carnbys flashlight
she lights their way to the office door
the lights flicker
large shadows are cast through the area by the remaining dim lights
the guard sits at the security desk talking on the phone
the security monitors are all out
i dont care if nothings wrong with the grid
somethings definitely wrong with our power
get someone down here pronto
the guard hangs up the phone
theres a whoosh of movement behind him
the guard turns to the sound
he flicks on his flashlight shining the beam into the dark corners of the area
nothing is there
something clatters in another room
the guard quickly turns to the sound of the movement
carnby and aline walk down the hallway
framed art hangs from the walls
small sculptures sit on pedestals along the way
the overhead lights in the hallway emit only a low glow flickering sporadically
aline leads the way with a flashlight
they come up to a door to a second hallway
the hairs on the back of carnbys neck rise up
he touches the back of his neck spooked
what is it
hairs on the back of my neck just stood up
aline gets it
carnby pulls out his para meter
its an old battered device
the display lights up as carnby turns it on
the para meter immediately picks up some readings
how come every time you show up my life gets complicated
i could ask you the same thing
carnby listens at the door
carnby nods to aline as he opens the door
nothing is there
the guard enters the ceramics room
the overhead lights give off only low glows flickering sporadically
the display cases and large sculptures give off long shadows
the guard walks through the room shining his flashlight around
he cant see anything out of the ordinary
a whoosh of movement slips past the guard
he turns quickly
he shines his flashlight around looking for anything out of the ordinary
he stands with his back to a display case
from out of the shadows behind the display case a long segmented tail emerges
the tail is covered in hard dark scales
at the end of the tail is a sharp spike
the tail suddenly flicks at the guard piercing him through the back of the head and out his mouth
the tails spike glistens with fresh blood
the guards flashlight clatters to the floor
the bulb the tail withdraws from the guard
the guards body falls to the ground dead
aline leads the way with the flashlight followed by carnby
the hallway is only faintly lit
from up ahead they hear a clattering sound
carnby reaches into his holster and pulls out his revolver
aline hands him the flashlight without a word
aline and carnby quietly come out a service door that leads to the ceramics room
they conceal themselves behind a pair of columns scanning the area before they step out
the lights are dim with long shadows stretching out through the area
aline is about to speak but carnby puts a finger to his mouth and shakes his head no
the dead body of the guard lies in a pool of blood on the ground
there seems to be no one else around
but then silently moving with a fluid grace a xenomorph creature emerges out of the shadows
the xenomorph creature is huge terrifying
it is seven feet tall covered in thick dark scales
it stands on two legs with long powerful arms that end in razor sharp claws and a segmented spiked tail poised behind it
its demonic head has black sunken eyes and a severe jaw lined with jagged fang like teeth
the head is identical to the stone carving in which the lynchpin artifact was encased
carnby and aline look shocked
they freeze not moving a muscle
another xenomorph creature steps out of the shadows
the two creatures congregate in the middle of the room
they are the same hulking grotesque brutes
the two creatures start to communicate
an unintelligible language passes between them
suddenly one of the creatures looks up sensing something
the creature looks directly at carnby and aline hiding behind the columns
the creature delivers a sharp whisper
and with that the creature fades into invisibility
it has totally disappeared
the second creature immediately follows suit also fading invisible
i think wed better run
carnby and aline scramble to their feet and sprint back towards the service door
an invisible creature comes racing after them
all that is visible is the effect of the creatures movement
it knocks over a statue as it chases after them
the statue smashes to the ground
aline is through the door
carnby runs through it and aline pulls it closed behind them
aline and carnby run down the long hallway towards a pair of double doors at the other end
the service door behind them bursts open
an invisible creature runs down the hallway towards them
as the invisible creature runs it knocks framed art off the walls smashes aside tables and chairs
the creature isnt visible only the effect of its movement
carnby turns and fires his gun at the on rushing creature
but his bullets dont hit anything except the wall on the other side of the hallway
carnby keeps firing still not hitting anything
the invisible creature races towards them
suddenly the double doors at the other end of the hallway burst open
the second invisible creature starts running towards them
both directions down the hallway are now blocked
carnby spots an open door marked storage room
he pushes aline into it and jumps in after her
carnby leans up against the door pushing it closed
aline fumbles for her building keys
theres a crash as the creature slams against the other side of the door
carnby strains to keep it closed
the door rattles as the creature crashes into it again
aline finds the right key
she gets it into the lock
suddenly the creature punches a clawed hand right through the door
the hand is visible as it digs its claws into alines arm
the claws cut deep gashes into her
she screams in pain
the impact knocks the key out of the lock
aline drops the keys as she clutches her arm
the creatures arm retracts out the hole in the door
it smashes into the door even harder trying to break through
carnby strains against the door trying to keep it closed
cant hold it
aline grabs her keys
she finds the right key jams the key in the lock and turns the bolt
theres another crash at the door
but the lock holds
is there any way out of here
why didnt you ask me that before you pushed me in here
theres another crash
carnby and aline back away from the door
the door starts to buckle from the impacts
carnby reloads his revolver
he has it ready
but then the crashing stops
aline and carnby listen
everything is quiet
the sound of helicopters can be faintly heard in the distance
carnby listens against the door
what do you think
carnby nods to her
aline unlocks the door
carnby steps out of the storage room revolver ready
the hallway is empty
aline steps out behind him
she motions to the double doors at the end of the hallway
those doors lead to the front entrance
carnby hands aline the flashlight
he grips his revolver
carnby and aline move down the hallway towards the double doors
as they move they listen intently
the only thing they can hear is the sound of their footsteps
scenes d to g omitted aline and carnby quietly open the double doors leading into the main hall
the lights are dim
moonlight streams in through the skylight above them
aline shines the flashlight around
she hears a whoosh of movement behind her and shines the flashlight towards it
the sound of a quickly approaching helicopter can be heard in the distance
the double doors burst open as an invisible creature smashes through them
it chases after them knocking everything in its path out of the way carnby and aline run
up ahead of them the second invisible creature comes crashing through the display cases heading right for them
carnby and aline are trapped between the two invisible creatures
they have nowhere to run
the sound of a helicopter rises up overhead
suddenly powerful spotlights switch on shining bright blue beams through the skylight
another set of spotlight beams shine through the high windows lining the main hall
a sleek black bureau helicopter hovers over the building
a pair of spotlights shine beams down through the skylight
in a hail of shattered glass agents barr male cheung female and marko male burst through the skylight rappelling down on zip lines from the hovering helicopter
they each carry a sleek high tech assault rifle with a lamp mounted on the top
they all wear full bureau combat gear body armor with a headset comm link and a helmet with a dark visor mounted on it
the creatures hiss in reaction and scramble out of the spotlights from the helicopter
the agents immediately open fire
their bullets glow with a pulse of yellow light as they streak through the air
all carnby and aline can see is the agents shooting glowing bullets into the unnaturally long shadows
but the squeal of one of the creatures shows that the agents bullets have found their target
as the glowing bullets hit the creature it momentarily flashes visible then invisible again
the two invisible creatures scatter slipping away into the shadows
the agents cut their zip lines dropping to the ground
as they land they all flip on their rifle mounted lamps
the bright blue beams cut through the darkness
their movements are precise controlled
they all have their rifles out scanning the area
agent barr has a high tech scanning device attached to his rifle
it is an updated version of carnbys para meter that monitors the electromagnetic energy in the vicinity
it is used to detect the presence of the xenomorph creatures
reading two xenos
a long shadow slips across the room
agent cheung sees it
agent cheung opens fire
agents barr and marko are immediately at her side firing at the invisible creature
their bullets glow as they streak through the air
but the creature is too fast
the glowing bullets streak through the air but dont hit it
dont let them get away
agents cheung and marko open fire sending streams of glowing bullets across the main hall
but they dont hit anything
agent barr scans around with his rifle mounted para meter and lamp
carnby and aline stand back not wanting to get in the agents way not equipped to really help
the dim lights suddenly flicker and come back on at full strength bathing the debris of the battle in a warm glow
agent barr turns his rifle to carnby and aline
they stand their ground facing him
krash reads the data streaming by on her banks of monitors
she speaks into her omnipresent headset
you lost them barr
agent barr holds his rifle trained at carnby and aline
agents cheung and marko move through the double doors into the hallway sweeping the area with their lamps making sure the creatures are gone
goddamn it krash i know
commander burke were secure
carnby is here
the lights around the museum have come back on
a pair of bureau humvees are parked with large spotlights set up in front of them shining into the museum
ommander burke stands with agent miles
they both wear full combat gear visors and headset comm links
burke addresses five agents in combat gear
i want a full security sweep
miles get fischer to send his sci and spy boys down here
the agents stream into the museum in formation
burke and miles follow in after them
the silhouettes of the five agents burke and miles come through the spotlight beams as they enter the museum
burke strides up to carnby and aline who stand with agent barr
miles follows after him
hat the hell are you doing here carnby
its commander burke
this is my unit
they saved our lives
you used to be able to take care of yourself carnby
gotten soft since you left
miles steps in between burke and carnby
cedrac im agent miles
this is commander burke
pleasure to meet you
hows the ph
aline looks surprised that burke knows so much about her
burke sees alines arm is bleeding from the gashes clawed into her by the creature
miles get her to a medic
aline looks over at carnby
he nods to her
ill catch up
agent miles escorts aline out of the museum
burke and carnby regard one another
why am i still looking at you
i need to know what those things are
that informations classified
if you were still an agent youd already know
but since youre not stay out of my way
burke turns to stride away
carnby grabs his arm
burke turns back annoyed
im asking nicely
burke grabs carnbys arm trying to twist it away
but carnbys fast enough to slip out of burkes hold
now angry burke grabs carnby by the collar shoving him against a stone column
but carnby deftly twists out of burkes grip and shoves him up against the same stone column
in the struggle carnbys hand flicks into burkes pocket
agent barr intervenes pulling carnby away
burke straightens himself out trying not to look rattled
get him out of here
carnby shrugs off agent barr and walks away
youre right commander
i guess i have gone soft
as carnby walks off he looks down in his hand
he has lifted burkes i d card out of his pocket
the front of the museum has been completely blocked off
there is lots of activity as bureau agents mill around
aline sits in the back of a emergency medical vehicle
a medic finishes dressing the cuts on her arm
carnby approaches her
aline nods to the medic and gets up to join carnby
they speak quietly
i want to finish studying those artifacts
i need to find out whats happened to john and the others
stay in contact
well meet up later
burke oversees a team of agents in biohazard suits as they sweep the scene running scans of the area on high tech hand held devices
photos are snapped by another agent
agent miles escorts aline over to burke
burke is distracted by the scanning device he is holding
commander i need to get to my office
the museums quarantined until were done
at least let me pack up my work
theres priceless artifacts in there
if they get damaged
burke looks up at aline
he gives a minute nod to miles
if you notice anything out of the ordinary let me know immediately
aline looks around at the agents scanning the destruction caused by the creatures
i dont think i want to know your definition of out of the ordinary
the lab is full of sleek high tech lab equipment and state of the art computers
the room is lit with a humming fluorescent light
surgical equipment and various pieces of high tech machinery buzz by an autopsy slab
surgical tools are laid out on a table
pinkertons body is laid out on the slab face down
fischer stands over pinkertons body
he holds a high tech hand held scanning device
the scanner is connected to a large monitor on a dolly next to the slab
fischer holds the scanner a few inches above pinkertons body passing it along the length of him
the image on the monitor matches the movements of the scanner
it shows a real time internal scan of pinkertons body displaying the skeleton internal organs and so on
visible on the monitor is a spinal worm curled up tight around pinkertons spine
fischer doesnt look up but his tone suddenly changes
you shouldnt be here carnby
carnby stands in the doorway
he waves burkes i d card
im not here
commander burke is
now what the hell is that thing inside him
your curiosity have anything to do with the fingerprint of yours i found on his corpse
the list of people i trust is short fischer
is it about to get shorter
fischer turns back to pinkertons body
carnby comes up and stands next to him
fischer takes a scalpel off the table and makes a careful incision along pinkertons back
have you i dd him
yeah we got dentals
agent james pinkerton
he was an agent
using tongs fischer peels back the skin of pinkertons back
the spinal worm is attached to pinkertons spine
went mia twenty years ago
im trying to get more intell but his records are so classified theyre practically invisible
arnby takes the tongs from fischer holding open the skin
fischer makes a series of incisions with the scalpel disconnecting the spinal worm from pinkertons spine
its fused with his nervous system
ive never seen this kind of symbiosis before
fischer pulls the spinal worm out of pinkertons open back with a pair of tongs
it hangs limply motionless
the spinal worm is long and thick covered with hard dark scales
it has dozens of tiny clawed feet that were connected to pinkertons spine
ischer drops the spinal worm in a tub
ischer notices the hand held scanning device is beeping faintly still registering something
he looks at the read out curious then concerned
scanners still reading something
fischer runs the scanner over pinkertons corpse
now fischer looks even more concerned
he turns the scanner on himself running it up and down his torso
fischer looks at carnby
carnby gets it
it might be him
fischer runs the scanner over carnbys torso
the scanner immediately starts beeping louder
they exchange a look between them
somethings inside carnby
aline sits at her desk analyzing the d scan she made of the lynchpin artifact
the abkani never cease to amaze me
line turns startled to see hudgens standing behind her
hudgens demeanor is friendly reassuring
such a complex society at a time when most of humanity was still hunting and gathering and huddling around fires
when did you get back
a few hours ago
i heard there was some excitement
are you alright
a bit shaken up
i apologize for snapping at you earlier
now what are you still doing here after all youve been through
hudgens cranes his neck to see alines computer screen
his eyes light up when he sees the scan of the lynchpin artifact
where did you get that image
hudgens looks curious friendly
this is a major find
ill need to analyze it
confirm its authenticity
i can do that myself
that wasnt a request
hudgens stands up to his full height suddenly menacing
where is the artifact
everything okay in here
agent cheung stands at the door still wearing her full combat gear
her visor is up
she casually holds her rifle
and you are
cedracs security detail
my dear do you have any idea who i
former agent sci and spy division
currently advisor status
i know exactly who you are
but im not your dear anything
hudgens looks back at aline and smiles warmly
ill just have to hold off my curiosity until morning
aline smiles stiffly
hudgens moves to leave
i forgot to ask
did you find the erebus this time
hudgens turns back and gives aline another smile
just an empty shipwreck
you were right
it was another wild goosechase
hudgens exits quickly
aline and agent cheung watch him go
since when do i have a security detail
since it seemed like you needed it
carnby lies on a bed with his shirt off
fischer runs the hand held scanner over carnbys torso
he looks at the results of carnbys scan on a monitor
a spinal worm is visible around carnbys spine
but it looks different than the others
it is small and shriveled and seems barely attached to the spine
theres one inside you too
but the symbiosis is incomplete
can you remove it
i could try
but it might paralyze you
aline sits at her computer checking out d scans of the four abkani artifacts
she is running an analysis the symbols carved into each artifact
streams of calculations run across the screen as the computer processes
the computer beeps as it comes to a conclusion
the symbols correlate to constellations in the night sky
aline hits copy on her computer and it burns a cd of the information she has processed
aline searches through a roll of maps
she pulls out a map of north america and lays it out on a work station
aline draws lines across the map trying to pinpoint a location based on the constellations
she marks the map up with latitude and longitude calculations
she looks back up at the computer screen
she taps her pen on the map
she looks frustrated
the computer beeps again
the cd copy has been made
aline rolls up the map and starts to pack up her belongings
fischer and carnby stand in front of an open armory cabinet
sleek assault rifles are lined up on a rack beside them
they stand on either side of a counter
a large monitor is on the wall behind them
im not much for coincidences
these organisms must be connected to those things from the museum
we call them xenomorphs
when did they first appear
with a remote control fischer clicks through images on the monitor as he talks
he brings up a series of anatomical schematics of the xenomorph creatures
two years ago
theyve been s top priority ever since
but its been almost exclusively in rural areas
this kind of urban infiltration is unprecedented
have you isolated any weaknesses
fischer brings up an image of the periodic table
most metals pass right through them
so normal bullets and blades are useless
but theyre vulnerable to elements to
osmium iridium platinum and gold
negates their ability to disrupt electricity
if they disrupt electricity why did my flashlight still work
the closer the current to its power source the less disruption
fischer takes a hand held para meter scanning device off a rack
it is a sleek updated version of carnbys para meter similar to the agents rifle mounted scanners
this is calibrated to track their disruption field
it wont help you see them but youll know when theyre nearby
fischer brings up a computer simulations of the creatures disruption field displaying how it works
they live almost exclusively in darkness
sunlights lethal in large doses
but only certain light frequencies hurt them
fischer takes a rifle off the rack and lays it down on the counter in front of them
off another rack fischer picks up a lamp
he flips it on and off shining the bright blue beam around
fischer snaps the lamp into place at the top of the rifle
these lamps are set to an effective frequency
fischer takes out several magazines of ammo out of the cabinet
he discharges a bullet
it glows yellow in his hand
but for maximum damage we use bullets coated in a photon accelerated luminescent resin
cuts right through them
fischer hands the rifle and a magazine to carnby
carnby loads the magazine and checks the rifle like a pro
im going to need a lot of those
carnby unlocks the multiple locks on the front door to his loft and enters
he carries a heavy duffle bag
he looks exhausted
warily carnby holds out the hand held scanner checking to see if it registers anything
but the loft reads clean
carnby puts the scanner down on a counter and allows himself to relax as he enters the loft
carnby walks in slowly a man whose adrenaline is wearing off and is only now feeling the pain
he shrugs off his trench coat and lets it drop on the floor
he drops the duffle bag on the floor
he kicks off his boots
he pulls off his holster and gun and drops them on a table
carnby takes out the lynchpin artifact
he puts it down on a work station in the lab area
carnby pulls off his shirt
his back is marked with old scars and fresh bruises
carnby walks over to his bed
he drops down onto the bed
his body sinks down finally relaxing
carnby falls fast asleep
fischer sits at his computer
he is going through the bureau database
he pulls up pinkertons file
a red classified sign flashes onscreen
fischer types in a password
classified flashes again
fischer turns to see agent miles standing at the door
commander burke wants to see you
hudgens walks through a dank cement room
various pieces of scientific equipment sit in a corner
shelves are lined with ancient artifacts small sculptures and masks
hudgens stops at a work station and pauses
a look of pain crosses his face
he winces holding it in
he steadies himself
at the other side of the lab is a large recess in the space
the opening is covered by thick cage bars covered in gold
the cage appears to be empty
but suddenly an invisible creature slams into the bars of the cage trying to lunge at hudgens
as it hits the bars fingers of electricity jolt through it making it visible for a split second
hudgens watches calmly
he goes to a small dial built into the wall beside the cage
hudgens turns up the dial
in the cage jagged bolts of electricity jolt around the invisible creature
it squeals and hisses from the electricity
finally the creature collapses and fades visible
the creature is unconscious but still alive
hudgens turns the dial back down
hudgens picks up a hypodermic syringe from a counter next to the cage
he injects the syringe into the creatures neck between two of its scales
he withdraws a syringe full of the creatures black sticky blood
he goes back to the work station rolling up the sleeve of his shirt
his arm is pocked with injection marks
hudgens ties off his arm preps a vein and injects himself with the syringe of creatures blood
he closes his eyes feeling the substance flow into him
aline walks up to an imposing slightly decrepit looking old brick building in a bad area of town
she goes to press the buzzer but the box is broken the wires limply hanging out
she knocks on the door
she stops annoyed
but then a slight involuntary smile comes across her face
aline fishes in her purse and pulls out a set of keys
she finds the key shes looking for and slips it into the lock on the front door
she pauses for a moment then turns the key
aline enters the loft
she looks around
aline closes the door behind her
she takes another few steps into the loft
she spots carnbys discarded trench coat on the floor
she walks up and picks it up with two fingers
i see nothings changed
aline hangs the coat on a hook
she enters the loft proper looking around
she sees carnby lying on his bed asleep
he looks peaceful
aline sees the lynchpin artifact sitting in the lab area
she unpacks her bag taking out three items wrapped in cloth
she places the three items next to the lynchpin artifact
she looks over at carnby sleeping in his bed
aline kicks off her shoes and walks over to the bed
she climbs onto the bed careful not to disturb carnby
he stirs a little but he doesnt wake up
aline lies down next to carnby on the bed
she notices the new scars and bruises along his back
aline lays her head on a pillow
their faces lie close together
she watches carnby sleep
aline leans over and gives carnby the lightest of kisses
he doesnt wake up
alines eyes flutter closed then open then closed again
within seconds shes asleep
burke stands behind krash at the monitor banks surveying the incoming information
agent miles holds the door open as fischer enters
miles stands at the door listening
burke doesnt face fischer
have you been meeting with carnby
hes got intell we need
and i trust him
burke turns around to face fischer
weve got to trust each other fischer
are you with us or not
fischer weighs his answer
what do you need from me
all the intell youve got on edward carnby
the kitchen is comfortable lived in
fischers suit jacket hangs on the back of a chair
his revolver and holster also hang on the chair
fischers wife sarah fischer early s stirs the contents of a pot with a wooden spoon
fischer makes a salad
what else could i do
i had to tell him
you did the right thing paul
from what youve told me carnby can take care of himself
the doorbell rings
ill get it
sarah hands fischer the wooden spoon
she gives him a quick warm kiss
she exits the room
sarah fischer hurries to the front door
she checks her appearance in a mirror in the foyer
she touches her hair purses her lips and turns to the door
she opens the front door a pleasant expression on her face
the lights in the kitchen start to flicker
fischer freezes listening
the house is quiet
fischer dives for the revolver hanging in his holster on the chair
he pulls a container of glowing bullets out of the pocket of his jacket
the container spills on the floor
he scrambles to pick up the bullets and load them into the revolver
fischer edges to the kitchen door listening anxious
everything is quiet
he quietly pushes open the door revolver ready
fischer creeps into the foyer
the lights flicker
no one is in the foyer
the front door is open
something crashes to the ground in the living room
fischer quietly opens the door to the living room gripping his revolver tightly
he steps into the room
the lights in the living room are out
a broken lamp lies smashed on its side
fischer comes around the side of the couch
he stops shocked
sarah fischers dead body lies in a pool of blood
fischer is suddenly grabbed and slammed into the wall
the impact knocks several framed photos of fischer and his wife off the wall
they shatter as they hit the floor
fischer is punched in the face hard
he is stunned
fischer is hurled over the couch
he lands heavily on a glass coffee table shattering the glass tabletop
the impact knocks his revolver out of his hands
fischer lies dazed in the broken glass
he looks up at his attacker
its hudgens standing over him
hudgens slams his fist into fischers face
fischer is now only semi conscious
hudgens pulls out a long thin spinal worm
its many clawed feet and razor sharp jaws snap away its segmented scaled body writhing in his grip
if you cant beat us fischer join us
hudgens grabs fischer by his hair and pulls his head back forcing his mouth open
we follow the spinal worm as it enters fischers mouth slipping down his throat
we continue to follow the spinal worm as it makes its way through fischers body weaving through the twists and turns of his digestive system and internal organs
the spinal worm tears through layers of fischers insides finally making its way to his spine
the spinal worm then wraps itself around fischers spine its tiny clawed feet grabbing hold and attaching themselves along its length
we move up fischers spinal cord to his brain
the spinal worm seems to be causing synapses to fire in chaotic bursts
we travel through fischers brain and out of his eyes
fischers expression is now calm
hudgens regards fischer looking pleased with himself
something chases young edward as he runs for his life through the misty dark forest
he runs towards a light up ahead
young edward enters the shed closing the door behind him
the small shed is cluttered with equipment for repairing power lines
a large transformer module sits at the back of the shed
it hums and crackles with electricity
something compels young edward to move closer towards the transformer and reach out a trembling hand
he places his hand against the transformers front grill
with a sudden snap and flash electricity courses through young edward
jagged fingers of blue light jolt around him
the loft is dark
carnby and aline are fast asleep on the bed lying next to one another
carnby wakes up with a start
he tries to get his bearings
carnby looks surprised to see aline lying next to him
he quietly gets out of bed letting her sleep
he pulls on a fresh shirt
carnby pads over to the lab area and turns on a desk light
he sees the wrapped items aline placed on his work station
carnby unwraps the items
they are the three abkani artifacts from the museum
carnby picks up the lynchpin artifact turning it around
something catches his eye
carnby fiddles with the artifact
suddenly the artifact telescopes out
instead of one thick ring it is now three successively smaller rings one piled on the other with a common hollow middle
carnby picks up the large ring artifact
he slots it into place on the telescoped lynchpin artifact
next carnby slots in the medium and small rings into place
the four pieces fit together perfectly creating a cylindrical device with a small round opening in the bottom
carnby cooks omelettes in the kitchen area of the loft
the ingredients are spread out on the counter
aline wakes up
she sits up in the bed and looks around
something smells amazing
aline trots over to the kitchen area as carnby serves up the omelettes
aline gives him a look
i love omelettes
carnby sits down across from aline
they eat while they talk
i figured out a connection with the symbols on those artifacts
they correspond to constellations
but somethings missing
maybe this will help
carnby takes out the assembled abkani device and puts it down on the table between them
aline picks up the device fascinated
she runs her fingers over the abkani symbols carved into the lynchpin artifact
she goes to her bag and pulls out the map she was working on and the cd
she hands carnby the cd
can you run the program on this
carnby goes over to his computer and inserts the cd
aline spreads out the map
she draws lines across it connecting up constellations with locations on the map
she writes out latitude and longitude calculations
aline comes up to carnby at the computer
the program is waiting for her calculations
she leans past carnby and enters the latitude and longitude numbers into the program
the computer processes the information
hundreds of map images flash across the screen as the computer searches for a match
what are we looking for
the abkani used constellations to pin point a geographical location
but i dont think i can isolate it closer than a hundred mile radius
the computer finds a match
a specific map appears onscreen with a mile radius circle marked in the center of it
thats us right there
carnby points to a spot on the onscreen map
carnby puts the dishes from their meal into the kitchen sink
the sink tap is running
aline clears the dishes
the para meter fischer gave carnby starts faintly beeping but the running sink tap covers the sound
something is coming
the lights in the loft flicker once
carnby turns off the tap and they listen intently
they can hear the scanner beeping faintly
the lights in the loft flicker and go out
aline grabs the flashlight and switches it on
carnby runs to his revolver and holster
he checks the chamber in his revolver
the bullets glow
carnby looks up sensing something
he spins around ready
a figure stands behind him
it is john
john looks fierce his face drawn gaunt
his eyes are sunken into dark recesses with nearly clear irises
john lunges at carnby
carnby is too surprised to defend himself
john slams carnby against the wall knocking his revolver out of his hands
john picks carnby up and hurls him across the loft
carnby crashes through furniture as he lands heavily
out of the shadows behind aline two figures emerge
they are both missing orphans one male one female
they have the same gaunt faces and clear irises as john
carnby picks himself up
he spots the orphans behind aline
the two orphans lunge at aline but shes able to dodge out of the way
the orphans are fast and fierce
aline leaps forward sliding across the floor towards carnbys revolver
she grabs it and spins to face the two orphans
but then the female orphan leaps out at her
aline fires hitting the female orphan in the shoulder
the female orphans jumps away into the shadows
aline scrambles to her feet the revolver ready
but the female orphans has disappeared
aline runs over to carnby
he grabs a shotgun from the weapons cabinet and loads it
that looked like john
the other two are from the orphanage as well
carnby pumps the shotgun
carnby and aline creep forward into the darkness of the loft
suddenly john lunges at him his teeth bared
carnby smashes john across the head with the shotgun
but john keeps coming slamming him against the wall
carnby breaks johns hold and swivel kicks him out of the way
john skitters off into the shadows
the female orphan leaps out at aline trying to tear into her with her teeth
carnby grabs a pipe leaning against the wall and runs for aline
the male orphan lunges out at carnby
he smashes the male orphan across the face with the pipe
aline struggles with the female orphan
carnby turns to see john rising up behind her about to strike
arnby reacts instinctively
he fires shooting john in the chest with a shotgun blast
john flails back dead
the male orphan jumps out at carnby
now working on instinct carnby spins and jams the pipe into his gut impaling him
the male orphan stumbles to the ground and dies
aline gets away from the female orphan
as the female orphan lunges at her again aline fires shooting her three times in the chest
but its only the third bullet the one that hits the female orphan dead center in the chest that takes her down
the female orphan falls back dead
aline comes up to carnby
he stands over johns corpse
you had no choice
somethings controlling them
how many are there altogether
the para meter starts beeping again louder and more frenetic
the lights start to flicker fading up and down
carnby unzips the duffle bag
its full of equipment given to him by fischer
carnby loads an assault rifle with magazines
he loads a pistol with the glowing bullets
carnby throws aline the pistol
she catches it in mid air
she checks it like a pro
aline and carnby stand together guns drawn ready
theres a moment of quiet
the lights in the loft flicker
the scanner beeps
something smashes into the lofts front door
carnby grabs the para meter
it beeps more insistently
the front door bursts open knocked right off its hinges by the invisible creature crashing through it
the invisible xenomorph creatures skewed inhuman p
as it looks across the loft searching
it locates carnby and aline and heads directly for them
ll that is visible of the creatures trajectory is furniture being knocked aside as the creature rushes towards them
the creature smashes right through a glass topped work table shattering it
papers whirl around in its wake
aline and carnby stand their ground facing the on coming creature as it lunges towards them
carnby and aline leap out of the way at the last moment
rolling away in opposite directions they simultaneously open fire
their glowing bullets hit the creature dead on
the creature squeals flashing visible from the multiple impacts
their glowing bullets pierce the creature and it tumbles to the ground dead
the creatures invisible corpse lies motionless
broken furniture and shattered glass is everywhere
carnbys para meter is quiet the readings subsiding with the creatures death
the lights stop flickering
wed better get out of here
suddenly all the lights in the loft go out in unison
all the computer monitors also go dark
the scanner starts beeping frenetically
electromagnetic readings shoot up registering multiple sources nearby
carnby and aline back up together ready for an attack
but the first thing they hear isnt a creature
its the sound of automatic gunfire
streaks of glowing bullets fly through the air
it is a unit laying down suppressing fire as the agents enter the loft through the broken front door
agents barr cheung and marko enter followed by five other agents
they all wear full combat gear their rifle mounted lamps illuminated their weapons in use
krash monitors the unit from the control room
banks of monitors stream data at her
krash speaks into her head set comm link cool and collected
multiple readings confirmed
back ups on the way
the agents fire glowing bullets through the dark loft
there are invisible creatures everywhere
the muzzle flashes and glowing bullets pierce the darkness of the loft
hadows swim through the space as the invisible creatures move around them attacking the agents with their razor sharp claws and spiked tails
an invisible creature swoops out of the shadows towards an agent who is firing in the opposite direction
the creature whips past the agent slicing him open with a fluid slash of its claws
the creature keeps moving directly for carnby
carnby and aline standing together fire their weapons in the darkness oblivious to the creature rushing towards them
but at the last second carnby turns instinctively as the creature lunges at him
carnby and aline turn and open fire on the creature
it flashes visible from multiple hits flailing off into the darkness
agent barr fires controlled bursts of glowing bullets into the dark loft
he screams into his comm link
where the hells our back up
the sound of a helicopter can be heard outside the loft
another invisible creature skirts along the edge of a wall avoiding the gunfire
it locates its target an agent firing up at the ceiling
it races towards the agent
the agent turns to the attack and tries to fire
but the creature is too fast
it slams the agent back against the wall and impales him with its spiked tail
agents barr and cheung spot this and open fire on the creature
it flails about fading visible from the impacts
the creature tries to scurry away but barr and cheung are on it
with precision and speed they blow the creature away
but more creatures attack
the fighting is fierce
glowing bullets streak through the darkness
the agents are calm and determined as they engage the creatures
carnby and aline hold their own sticking together shooting at whatever shadows move around them
six agents in full combat gear burst into the loft
leading the unit is commander burke
agent miles is with him as is agent turner mid s
burke miles turner and the other agents immediately join the battle laying down suppressing fire
an agent carrying a rifle mounted grenade launcher fires an incendiary flash grenade at the upper level of the loft
with a flash of blinding light the grenade explodes
creatures squeal as flames swoop up through the upper level
glowing bullets fill the dark loft
creatures squeal and flail from the hits
in the darkness of the loft carnby aline and the agents finish off the remaining invisible creatures
the last creature goes down in a hail of glowing bullets
the agents strafe the creatures corpse to make sure its dead
agent barr and carnby exchange a look between them
barr clearly respects carnbys abilities
the loft is still dark
barrs rifle mounted scanner no longer registers any creatures
were clear sir
burke looks around at the remains of the battle
the loft is totally trashed
a small fire burns in the upper level
love what youve done with the place carnby
miles runs a hand held scanning device over johns corpse
the scanner beeps indicating the presence of a spinal worm
sir this ones infected too
agent turner scans the female orphans corpse
his scanning device beeps
she has a spinal worm too
got another one here
burke immediately turns his weapon to carnby
the red laser sight makes a glowing dot on carnbys chest
taking their cue from burke the other agents in his unit all train their weapons on carnby
several glowing red dots hover on his chest
drop your weapon and get down on the ground
what are you doing
hes been infected with some kind of organism
he could be under its control
aline turns to carnby
ive got one inside me
but its not controlling me
youll excuse me if i dont take your word for it
now drop your weapon
carnby holds his weapon at his side
he doesnt drop it
but he doesnt move either
aline steps in between carnby and the agents
the red dots are now trained on her chest
get out of the way
the agents try to get a clear shot around aline
hes not one of them
if ive got to shoot through you to get to him ill do it
carnby looks up at the lights
they are still dark
why are the lights still out
barr consults his scanner
it isnt registering anything
forget to pay your power bill carnby
an agent standing at the other end of the loft hears something shuffling behind him
he turns to look
something grabs the agent slams him back against the wall and rips out his neck
its another orphan with the same fierce gaunt look and clear irises
burke turns away from carnby for a moment trying to figure out whats happening
carnby suddenly lifts his weapon and points it at burke
burke sees this but before he can react carnby fires
carnbys bullet whizzes past burke and hits an orphan dead center in the gut sending him flailing back dead
the orphan was about to pounce on burke
theres a moment as burke and carnby look at one another
burke realizes carnby just saved his life
the orphans attack
they are the grown up children from carnbys orphanage
like pinkerton they are difficult to kill immune to pain fast and deadly
they all have the same gaunt wild look with sunken eyes and nearly clear irises
the orphans leap out at the agents quick and fierce
they bite and claw and use their superhuman strength to throw around the agents and tear them apart
the dark loft is again lit up with glowing bullets streaking through the darkness
the agents rifle mounted lamps shine around but the effect is chaotic disorienting
as the orphans attack they make quick work of many of the agents
glowing bullets fly around everywhere
the screams of agents being torn apart mix with bursts of automatic gunfire
carnby and aline stay together dodging the attacking orphans and firing into the darkness
an orphan rises up behind carnby
he spins and shoots her in the side
but she just keep coming
carnby shoots the orphan again this time dead center in the chest
the orphan collapses dead
carnby checks the corpse
the bullet came out the other side
a mixture of red blood and black sticky ooze drips from a bullet hole right over the orphans spine
carnby grabs the comm link off the body of a dead agent
youve got to kill the organism to stop them
aim for the spine
cross the loft burke listens to the comm link
an orphan is attacking agent miles
burke takes careful aim and shoots the orphan in the back right on the spine
the orphan falls over dead
spinal shots a kill shot
with this information the agents quickly gain the upper hand against the orphans attack
the orphans are fast and deadly but they have no organization
now that the agents have a handle on this new threat their precision and speed returns
soon the battle is over
dozens of bodies of dead agents and dead orphans lie littered around carnbys destroyed loft
only carnby aline burke miles barr cheung marko and turner remain alive
burkes and carnbys eyes meet
burke approaches carnby
the other agents all stand by waiting for an order from burke
aline watches them ready to step in
you remember the number one rule they teach you in training
trust your instincts
burke and carnby face off
so is hudgens
and ive got a situation brewing that makes this scrap look like a bar brawl
what does hudgens have to do with this
thats what i want to find out
i need you both to brief me in the air
burke turns to walk off but then stops
he turns back to carnby
burke holds out his hand
oh and carnby
ill need my i d back
he pulls out burkes i d card and hands it back to him
a massive long abandoned structure built directly against the face of a mountain
this is the entrance hall of britannia mine
agents mill about setting up perimeter defenses
humvees are being positioned as barricades
large spotlights are being set up to illuminate the area with power cables leading inside the entrance hall
agents barr cheung and marko are part of the team outside setting up the defenses
the helicopter carrying carnby aline commander burke and agents miles comes down for a landing next to two other helicopters already sitting in front of the mine
the moment the helicopter touches down burke leaps out barking into his comm link
carnby aline and miles exit after him
what are you reading
rash swivels in her chair processing data making adjustments to sensors and checking out the information scrolling across the bank of monitors
she wears a head set
were practically off the scale commander
this is unprecedented
should i initiate contingency nine alpha
we dont have time to wait for them to mobilize
is that a negative commander
burke leads carnby aline and miles to the entrance hall
initiate nine alpha on my authority
but i wont hold my breath
by the time this clears defense council well be dead or drinking
rusty construction vehicles detritus and rubble lie discarded throughout the hall
several shafts have been dug into the mountain
narrow paths lead up the slope
agents scurry around setting up the defense system
the main position is set up just inside the entrance to the hall
burke and miles enter followed by aline and carnby
weve got three perimeters of flash mines
gatling guns are set to electromagnetic motion tracking
and every available agent in the vicinity is here
i know miles
but back up wont make it before sunrise
several raised platforms stand in the middle of the hall
on one platform agent turner helps two agents unload a large gold plated generator from the back of a humvee
generator will be on line shortly sir
burke nods to turner as he and the others walk by
carnby and aline get into step with burke and miles
it looks like youre going to war
the highest xeno concentration on record is closing in on this location
this could be our chance to wipe them out once and for all
a tunnel carved directly into the rock wall of the mine leads off into darkness
carnby stares down at the tunnel
we need to go down there
theyre coming here for a reason
until we know what theyre after were never really going to be able to stop them
agent miles consults his hand held para meter
somethings definitely down there sir
but theres too much interference to get a clear reading from here
miles looks at burke expectantly
carnby and aline watch him as well
burke looks conflicted
miles youre in charge of perimeter defense
nothing gets in or out until we find out whats down there
batteries of flash mines mines that explode with a burst of blinding light set to electromagnetic sensors are being positioned in wide perimeters around the entrance hall
automatic gatling guns loaded with chains of glowing bullets are set up at key points around the area
the gatling guns are mounted on swiveling robotic bases able to automatically turn to face on coming targets
agent feenstra mid s tests the motion sensor on one of the gatling guns with her hand
the gun swivels accurately to match the movement of her hand
agent feenstra nods to the two agents standing behind the gatling gun
they tinker with its guidance system
carnby and aline walk carefully down a pitch black tunnel illuminated only by their lights
along with them are commander burke and agents barr cheung and marko
they each carry assault rifles with lamps mounted on them
their visors are down
ive been thinking about something
the abkani prophecy
the shadows that make ghosts of men
every culture has a story about the end of the world
but not every story starts to come true
agent barr carries a hand held para meter
its picking up high electromagnetic readings
its definitely this way sir
they pass by various pieces of mining equipment long since discarded
thick dust and cobwebs hang off the equipment
they make their way down the tunnel
the tunnel ends at a slightly larger rounded chamber with walls of solid rock
they cant go any further
cobwebs and thick dust hang everywhere
carnby aline burke barr cheung and marko emerge out of the tunnel into the chamber
its a dead end
agent barr checks his para meter
readings are getting stronger
carnby looks around sensing something
he wipes away some cobwebs and dust and runs his hand over the chamber walls
well double back
take another tunnel
aline look at this
aline approaches the spot where carnby stands
she shines her flashlight beam in the wiped off area
faint abkani symbols are carved into the wall
the agents all start wiping away the cobwebs and dust examining the walls for more symbols
they all shine their beams of light through the dark space searching
cheung finds more abkani symbols on another wall
theres more over here
as agent marko moves through the space with his lamp his boot hits a small protrusion in the dusty ground
agent marko shines his lamp down on ground
with his boot he pushes away the dust on the ground
theres a carving on the floor
agent barr spots marko and shines his lamp towards him
what do you got marko
agent marko presses down on the carving with his boot
suddenly the stone floor beneath agent marko crumbles away revealing a deep circular shaft
agent marko cant hold on and he falls into the shaft
he screams as he falls
the shaft drops down sixty feet
marko falls unable to stop his descent
the shaft walls are rough hewn rock
small fingers of lichen grow out of the cracks in the stone
an ancient fragile wooden ladder is imbedded directly into the rock wall its rungs made of thick knotted old branches
the shaft drops into a round sand covered room
razor sharp spikes poke out of the loose sand beneath the shaft
agent marko falls directly onto the spikes
he is impaled on them
the others rush to the lip of the shaft
they can barely see the illumination of markos flashlight in the depths below
weve got to get down there
agent miles surveys the defense position inside the hall
the spotlights arent on yet
defense perimeters up
still waiting for the generator to come on line
were retrieving marko
keep me posted
agent feenstra checks her rifle loading in a fresh magazine
she looks a little nervous having trouble getting it to fit
miles gently takes the rifle from feenstra
he slams the magazine in and checks the rifle
he hands it back
how long do we have to hold them
only until dawn
thats four hours away
n the side of a mountain rising up over britannia mine hudgens and fischer stand watching the activity below
jagged bolts of lightning and rumbling thunder echo around them
the sound of hissing comes up around them
suddenly one by one creatures start fading into visibility behind them
more and more creatures appear fading visible until there are dozens of xenomorph creatures stretching down the mountain side
hudgens looks back at his creature army
he lets an evil smile slip across his face
all at once the creatures start leaping down the mountainside
as they run they all start fading invisible
dozens of agents in full combat gear are in position
they are armed tense and ready
suddenly the scanner on agent miles rifle starts to beep
at first the beeps are spread apart
then the beeps sound in rapid succession faster and faster
agent miles runs up to agent turner
he is still tinkering with the generator
the spotlights are still off
where the hell are the lights
the generators not coming on line
they must be disrupting it
burke and agents barr and cheung lower themselves down the shaft on zip lines
they descend quickly and smoothly
carnby and aline have to take the long way down
they carefully climb down the rungs of the ancient wooden ladder built into the shaft
carnby steps down on a weak rung and it starts to give way
when aline steps down on it moments later it breaks
line starts to fall but carnby is there to catch her
as burke descends he speaks into his comm link
weve got incoming
what are your orders
hold tight miles
once we retrieve marko were coming back up
whatevers down here is going to have to wait
there is a low rumbling sound above them
small rock fragments shower down into the open mouth of the shaft
theres a creaking sound
the collapsed floor has triggered a trap
in the ceiling directly above the shaft a heavy round stone column suddenly breaks loose
more rock fragments rain down into the shaft
everyone presses against the shaft walls to avoid the falling rocks
the stone column drops into the shaft with a thunderous crash
it fits perfectly
the column starts sliding down the shaft towards them
in the distance a bright flash goes off
the flashes light up the landscape
the inhuman squeals of the creatures can be heard in the distance
the helicopters all take off hovering up into the air above the mine
agent miles and the agents in position watch the horizon
dozens of flashes go off in the distance
theyve hit the outer perimeter
miles scanner is reading off the scale
it beeps at a frenetic pace registering dozens of approaching creatures
electromagnetics around the mine are off the scale
krashs voice starts to distort with static
but the comm link is now only giving off static
the friction from the shaft walls is the only thing slowing the stone columns relentless descent down the shaft
the weight of the column crumples the ladder as it falls
as carnby and aline try to climb down the ladder it is getting more and more rickety and unsteady
burke and barr are almost at the bottom of the shaft
cheung is having problems with her zip line
it keeps jamming slowing her descent
the floor is covered in a thick layer of fine sand
burke lands safely
barr lands next to him
they quickly detach their zip lines and pull markos body off the spikes
the stone column is almost at aline and carnby
the ladder is being ripped apart by the column
they are out of time
carnby grabs hold of burkes and barrs zip lines which now hang loose down the shaft
aline throws her arms around carnbys neck
carnby releases his tight grip on the zip lines
together carnby and aline slide down the zip lines
carnby and aline slide past agent cheung
she is still hovering on her jammed zip line
but they are going too fast to stop
burke trains his rifle on the spikes
he opens fire shattering the spikes
they crumble no longer dangerous
carnby and aline drop down out of the shaft
carnby lets go of the zip lines and they fall to the sand by the spikes rolling to safety
burke looks up the shaft
he sees cheung hovering above the stone column almost at her
cut the line
the column continues to drop
its right above cheung
cheung pulls out a knife and cuts the zip line cord
she drops down the rest of the way
as agent cheung lands she breaks her ankle from the impact
she screams in pain
burke hauls cheung out of the way at the last second
he column drops to the ground with a crash totally sealing off the shaft
theres no way back up
he sand chamber is pitch black
the only light comes from their lamps and flashlights
barr wraps up cheungs broken ankle
line inspects the abkani symbols carved into the walls of
she lays her rifle against the wall as she reads them
large rough statues depicting the xenomorph creatures have been carved directly into the rock walls of the chamber
one wall is covered floor to ceiling with human skulls
carnby approaches aline in front of the abkani symbols
its a warning
carnby looks at the wall of human skulls
the gist of it is even if you make it down here alive youre already dead
burke barks into his comm link
krash i need another exit
can you run a sonar pulse at this depth
are you reading me
cant get through to krash either
too much interference
use the second perimeter as your firing mark
ill be there as soon as i find a way out
in the sand near barr and cheung something moves
agent miles and the other agents watch the perimeter
hold your fire until theyre at the second perimeter
the flash mine detonations are now much closer
the agents open fire letting loose a barrage of glowing bullets
streaks of light fill the night
the thundering gunfire of the rotating gatling guns fills the air
thousands of glowing bullets streak through the night
the hovering helicopters open fire with their side mounted gatling guns
the on rushing creatures squeal and flash visible as the gatling guns cut into them with waves of glowing bullets
but agent miles scanner continues to beep frenetically
more and more creatures continue to rush towards them
the automatic ground mounted gatling guns start running out of ammunition
the sound of gunfire is replaced by the high pitched whine of the turbines rotating without bullets
the helicopters continue to lay down suppressing fire but they are also running out of ammo
agent miles and the other agents in the hall continue to fire away into the night
ammo running low
how many of these goddamn things are there
agent miles scanner registers that waves of the creatures are still quickly approaching them
cheung tests her injured ankle
she can walk with a limp
something moves through the sand towards aline
carnby looks over at the last moment
with a loud squeal a sand worm bursts out of the sand in front of aline
at the end of its elongated body a pair of snapping jaws fold out lined with razor sharp teeth
aline scrambles back and falls down
her rifle is out of reach
another sand worm bursts out of the sand diving for carnby
but he is quick on the draw
he shoots the sand worm before it can bite him
the bullets blow apart the sand worms head
the sand on the chamber floor comes alive with movement as sand worms burrow towards them
agents barr and cheung open fire on the sand worms
aline fumbles for her flashlight shining it at the sand worm
it recoils from the light and hisses at her
the sand worms jaws fold open revealing its razor sharp teeth
the sand worm tries to dodge the light
it snaps at aline with its jaws and lunges at her
she grabs it by the torso just under the snapping jaws
the sand worm struggles trying to bite aline
she can barely hold it away from her
her grip starts to loosen
the sand worms snapping jaws are almost at alines face
she strains to hold it away
with the sound of a gunshot the sand worms head explodes
it flops to one side dead
carnby stands behind it his gun smoking from the shot
a sand worm bursts out and chomps down on cheungs bad foot
barr shoots the worm that bit cheung
cheung falls back her body seizing up from its poisonous bite
cheungs body contorts
barr grabs her as cheungs head reels back and her body goes limp
burke turns his face grim
he opens fire on the sand worms
with precision and intensity he fires controlled bursts at any movement under the sand
carnby fires along with him
after a few seconds the movement has stopped
aline carnby burke and barr stand together
they look down at cheungs body
over the comm link burke can hear the sounds of the battle going on up above them
weve got to get up there
the agents fire streaks of glowing bullets into the night
flash mines explode close by
a creature leaps out at agent miles
he spins and opens fire
the creature flashes visible as miles riddles it with bullets
the creature flails around dying
creatures start leaping out at the agents jumping over the humvee barricades and slashing at agents with their claws
the agents strafe every creature they see
a creature jumps on an agents back and tears at him
another creature pounces on an agent ripping him open
dozens of creatures stream into the hall
the agents lay down steady streams of fire their glowing bullets streaking through the night
gunfire echoes through the hall
parks fly out around the generator as agent turner holds an electrical torch to a component
sweat drips from his forehead
he wipes his eyes clear as he works
agent turner tests to see that his electrical work is secure
an agent stand with him ready to switch on the generator
the agent switches on the generator
it hums to life
he dark hall is filled with blazing light from the battery of spotlights set up around the entrance hall
the creatures hiss and recoil from the spotlight beams
some begin smoldering under the glare
creatures take cover in the shadows behind old pieces of mining equipment
most race away from the light into the darkness outside the mine
the agents continue to shoot into the night blowing away the retreating creatures
theyre turning back
heres a moment of quiet
the agents slump back relieved
the creatures are all gone
weve got to refuel and reload
well be back asap
the helicopters pull away flying up over the mountains and past the horizon
agent feenstra turns to agent miles
we made it sir
miles and feenstra exchange a look of relief
fischer appears at the end of the platform
fischer approaches agent turner and the other agent standing at the generator
his demeanor is now totally different
he is cold menacing
gent turner turns to see fischer approaching
in a quick motion fischer grabs agent turner by the throat and hurls him out of the way
the other agent fires on fischer with her weapon
fischer takes a bullet in the shoulder
it doesnt stop him
fischer lunges for the agent
he knocks her back and grabs her face
fischer snaps the agents neck killing her
agent turner runs towards fischer firing a sustained burst of automatic gunfire
agent turners bullets rip into him but fischer keep coming
fischer lunges at turner grabbing him and slamming him against the generator
fischer smashes turner in the face almost knocking him out
fischer tears open turners combat vest
four grenades hang from the vest
ne by one fischer pulls the pins out of the four grenades
turner starts to regain consciousness just in time to see this
his eyes go wide in fear
fischer hold turner against the generator
fischer is too strong for turner to get away
the grenades all explode
fischer and turner are instantly killed
the explosion ignites the generator
it explodes in a crescendo of flame and sparks
he lights go out
there is now no protection from the creatures
the spotlights are extinguished
agent miles and the remaining agents turn on their rifle mounted lamps
miles scanner registers dozens of signals approaching
gent miles opens fire sending a stream of glowing bullets at the approaching creatures
gunfire rings out all around
glowing bullets streak through the dark night in all directions
nearby an agent screams
the defenses have become chaotic uncontrolled
glowing bullets fly everywhere
the squeals of injured creatures mingle with the screams of dying agents
the constant rattle of automatic gunfire fills the night
arr and carnby lay cheung and markos bodies to one side of the chamber their faces covered with their vests
burke paces back and forth screaming into his comm link
re route those copters
pull all agents back into the mine
set formation in teams of three
but all that he can hear through the comm link is gunfire and the occasional scream
carnby approaches burke carefully
burke looks furious
well find a way out
burke signals to barr
they sweep through the sand chamber exploring it with their lamps
carnby approaches aline
she is standing over one of the sand worm corpses
its head has been blown off but its torso is intact
carnby turns the sand worms body over with his boot
its just like the organism fischer took out of pinkerton
maybe this is what they look like when they grow outside a human host
burke stops at a dark recess carved into the sand chamber
the recess is thick with cobwebs and dust
burke cleans the cobwebs away
he stops surprised at what he sees in the recess behind the cobwebs
i think youd better see this
gents miles agent feenstra and two other agents are barricaded behind pieces of mining machinery
they shoot streams of glowing bullets across the dark entrance hall
suddenly an invisible creature grabs the first agent from behind a rusty piece of machinery
the creature throws the agent into the air
he lands heavily stunned
before the agent can get to his feet three invisible creatures pounce tearing him to shreds
rom behind his position miles shoots at the creatures with glowing bullets scattering them
the second agent stands behind a piece of machinery tense rifle ready
she hears a whoosh of movement nearby
she turns but cant see anything
she hears a shuffling sound above her
she looks up
the creature is above her on top of the machinery
the agent tries to shoot but the creatures tail snaps at her impaling her with its tail spike
agent miles and agent feenstra shoot at the creature with precise bursts of glowing bullets
the creature leaps at them
miles and feenstra hold their positions riddling the creature with glowing bullets
a creature leaps out at feenstra
she hears the whoosh of movement at the last moment and swivels firing in the direction of the creature
ut shes slammed off her feet
feenstra gets a deep gash in her thigh from the creatures spiked tail
the creature pounces
but feenstra is fast enough
she blows away the creature with a burst of glowing bullets
aline carnby burke and barr stand in front of the dark recess in the sand chamber
the recess is completely sealed up by a solid concrete wall
line comes up to the concrete wall running her hands along its flat surface
it is obviously not abkani
the abkani didnt put this here
agent barr shines his light across the concrete wall
theres no way through
theres always a way
burke opens his pack
inside it are several packages of c explosive
agent miles and agent feenstra are barricaded behind an old mining vehicle
the bodies of dead agents lie around them
agent feenstra bleeds from the wound in her thigh
the lights on their rifles are the only lights in the hall
an invisible creature jumps out at them knocking debris out of the way as it charges
agent miles rolls away at the last second as the creature slams into the old mining vehicle
agent feenstra spins around and empties her last clip into the creature killing it
miles throws feenstra a magazine
feenstra loads it in
miles tries to get a signal on his comm link
but it just gives out static
agent miles pulls off his comm link
i cant walk
if i lay down suppressing fire maybe you can make it out of here
i die fighting or i dont die at all
agent miles opens fire into the night
his bullets glow as they streak through the air
feenstra picks herself up and opens fire alongside him
creatures squeal in the distance as the bullets find their marks
feenstra empties out her last magazine
an invisible creature leaps over the barricade and pounces on feenstra tearing into her
miles shoots at the creature emptying his last magazine
but hes too late to save feenstra
her torn up body slumps against their barricade agent miles is alone
he is out of ammunition
he pulls the trigger futilely
miles stands firm
he flips up his visor
miles closes his eyes
he is hoisted into the air by an invisible creature and thrown to the ground
invisible creatures tear him apart
carnby aline barr and burke take cover behind the stone column
burke holds a remote detonator
it is active
burke tries to get a signal on his comm link
but all he gets is static
looking grim burke prepares to press the button on the detonator
you sure this is going to work
burke shrugs and presses the button
the detonator counts down
a tremendous explosion rocks the sand chamber
sand whirls through the air
concrete fragments blow out from the recess
as the smoke clears carnby aline burke and barr approach the recess
the concrete wall has been blown open
smoke rises up off the ruined wall
the sand chamber now opens up into another dark room
carnby aline barr and burke step over the rubble of the concrete wall
they shine their lights around the dark room
they are in a large abandoned bureau lab
thick dust covers all surfaces
but it was once a high tech facility
on one side of the lab is a sliding metal door
what is this place
medical equipment scientific instruments and computers have been left as they were untouched for two decades
a series of glass tubes are lined up along one wall
in each tube a spinal worm lies dead floating in gelatinous liquid aline checks out a series of diagrams affixed to another wall
they are anatomical schematics for the spinal worms
there are also diagrams of the human body with markings isolating key areas of the spinal cord
carnby stands in front of a row of twenty clear glass basins each about the size of a child
each basin has a small metal tag on it
carnby wipes the layer of dust off one of the metal tags
the tag reads e
this is where it happened
aline steps up next to carnby
who did this to you
burke and barr continue to explore the room with their rifle mounted lamps
barr finds a pair of huge metal hangar doors
carnby burke and aline approach barr at the hangar doors
next to the hangar doors is a control panel
barr pulls the front off the control panel revealing a rusted hand crank
barr pulls on the hand crank
it wont give
carnby joins him and together they strain to move the hand crank
the hand crank clanks into the open position
an old mechanism is engaged
the hangar doors slide open revealing another doorway behind them
but this one is clearly not part of the lab
it is an ancient solid gold door carved with abkani symbols
the gold door is built into a wall of rough rock
it looks like the lab was built right around the gold door
in the center of the door is a small cylindrical opening
line uses her flashlight to read the symbols on the door
one symbol is prominent among the others the dark spirit
aline reaches into her pack and takes out the abkani device
it is the exact size of the cylindrical opening in the door
the same dark spirit pictogram is engraved on the lynchpin
so its a key
burke surveys the room with a grim expression
i say we got two options
one we open this door deal with whatevers on the other side
the pictograms carved here make it pretty clear thats a bad idea
two we set enough c to bury this place
keep whatevers in there down here for good
carnby stares at the gold door
the answers ive been looking for my whole life could be in there
some doors are locked for a reason
carnby looks away from the gold door
how much c you got left
barr pulls open his pack revealing several packages of c
enough to blow this place to
barr is cut off by a bullet hitting him in the head
blood spurts out as barr collapses to the ground dead
hudgens stands behind them carrying two pistols
im afraid i cant allow that
before they can react hudgens presses a pistol to alines throat
he points the other pistol at burke and carnby
now drop your weapons and back away
carnby and burke drop their guns and step back
carnby glares at hudgens
our early work was crude i admit
but eventually we perfected the implant process
you were our last failure carnby
if you hadnt escaped never wouldve shut down the experiments
burkes eyes flash with anger
theres no way this was sanctioned
before your kind took over had very different
now you just blaze in and destroy everything before we can learn to control it
ive wasted twenty years working in secret because of short sighted men like you
hudgens sees the abkani device aline is holding
there it is
alines expression is firm unafraid
she grips the device tightly
hudgens is about to pull the trigger
you were a fine archeologist
hudgens turns to carnby curious
give him the key
enough people have died today
aline sees carnby is serious
she holds out the device to hudgens
you couldnt have opened it anyway
not without this
hudgens takes out the hollow cylinder artifact he found on the erebus
he hands it to aline
aline inserts the artifact into the hollow circular space at the bottom of the device turning it into place
the device is now a full cylinder with a flat protrusion on the bottom
with one pistol pointed at burke and carnby and the other at aline hudgens directs her to the gold door
insert the key
line inserts the device into the opening in the door
now turn it
aline rotates the device using the flat protrusion on the bottom
it clicks into place
a small crack splinters away from the opening where the device sits
the crack splits off into several other cracks
hudgens points his pistols at the others but his attention is clearly directed at the gold door
when we found the first of them saw just another threat to be eliminated
but i knew it was something more
it was the first
the first to wake
ive woken others since then
but the rest are coming
as hudgens speaks carnby burke and aline exchange a look between them
carnbys eyes indicate the c in agent barrs pack
burke and aline understand
the cracks splinter out dividing until they cover the entire door
in a rush of fragments the cracked gold crumbles to the ground
he empty doorway now leads into darkness on the other side
hudgens steps through the doorway
the doorway opens up into a vast cave hundreds of feet high and wide stretching off into darkness
the cave walls are rough hewn rock untouched by human hands
the walls of the cave are marked with hundreds and hundreds of tunnels pocking the rock like a hive leading off into the depths of the mountain
hudgens moves into the cave tentative but excited
suddenly theres a scratching scurrying sound
a xenomorph creature emerges out of one of the tunnels
out of another tunnel comes a second xenomorph
and a third
across the vast cave dozens of xenomorphs creep out of individual tunnels
hudgens steps further into the cave
the xenomorphs approach him their heads darting about
the xenomorphs surround hudgens on all sides
his steps are careful
he reaches his hand out to one of the creatures
he creature moves up to hudgens hand smelling it
the creature lunges at him ripping into him with its teeth
the other xenomorphs surrounding hudgens pounce on him as well
the creatures tear hudgens apart
like a dam breaking hundreds of xenomorphs start streaming out of the hive like tunnel system of the cave
standing in the doorway aline sees the creatures coming
carnby shoves the hand crank into the closed position
the hangar doors in front of the abkani doorway start to close
aline backs away from the doorway
aline opens fire with an assault rifle
the glowing bullets streak into the dark cave hitting several of the approaching creatures
but there are too many of them
they keep coming
the hangar doors are almost closed
the xenomorphs are only a few feet from the doorway
the hangar doors slam closed just in time
a heavy impact thumps against the other side of the hangar doors
the xenomorphs are trying to get though
burke is positioning c charges around the lab
he wires them all through a remote detonator
these doors wont hold them for long once we get out we can remote detonate
carnby approaches the sliding metal door at the side of the lab
the dust around the door has been swept back
look at the dust on the floor
this is where hudgens got in
carnby engages the opening mechanism and the door slides open revealing a dark tunnel leading away from it
burke makes sure the remote detonator signal is active
all he has to do is press the button on the detonator
the hangar doors shake from the impacts of creatures slamming into them
carnby aline and burke run down the long dark tunnel lighting their way with flashlights
a few doors line the tunnel but they are all welded shut
carnby spots a dim light up ahead
the tunnel ends at the rungs of a metal ladder built right into the wall
aline shines her flashlight up it
a strip of light is visible way up high at the top of a long shaft
aline climbs up the ladder
carnby climbs up behind her
burke shines his lamp down the dark tunnel
the crashing sound of impacts against the doors echo down the tunnel
burke looks at the remote detonator in his hand
the signal is inactive
aline climbs up the rungs of the ladder built into the shaft wall
carnby climbs up after her
urke stands at the bottom of the shaft looking up at them
carnby stops climbing and looks down at burke
the remote detonators inactive
the signal cant get through
well find a way
you saved my life carnby
i dont much like debts
burke ducks back out of the shaft
carnby jumps down to the bottom of the shaft chasing after burke
burke runs up to the sliding door to the lab
he engages the opening mechanism
the door slides open
carnby races down the tunnel towards him
burke enters the lab
he closes the sliding door behind him
carnby gets to the sliding door just as its closing
he tries to engage the opening mechanism but it wont work
carnby tries to pull it open but the doors jammed shut
line runs up to carnby as he tries to pry open the door
if he detonates those charges were all dead
carnby looks torn
aline reaches out her hand
carnby takes alines hand
they run towards the shaft
burkes rifle is jammed into the opening mechanism of the sliding door blocking it from engaging
the hangar doors are warped from the impacts
the gap between the doors is being pulled open by dozens of creatures
the hangar doors start to buckle under the pressure
he remote detonator in burkes hand is now active
carnby and aline quickly climb up the ladder
they are almost at the top of the shaft
the shaft is sealed with a pair of corrugated metal doors
sunlight shines through the thin crack between the doors
carnby points his gun at the metal doors above them
a small storm cellar is built into a corner of the orphanages front lawn
the corrugated metal doors are locked from the outside with a chain and rusty padlock
a burst of gunfire blows out from inside the storm cellar breaking open the padlock
the doors are thrown open
he sun rises on the horizon
burke looks around the abandoned lab
the creatures are almost through the hangar doors
the gap is just wide enough for one creature to stick its head through
it snaps its jaws at burke
burke presses the button on the detonator
the detonator counts down
a tremendous explosion rocks the shaft
a swirling geyser of flame shoots up towards the top of the shaft
carnby and aline dive out of the shaft just in time
the geyser of flame erupts out of the storm cellar
the shock wave knocks them to the ground
a cloud of dust swirls up out of the shaft
the mine shakes from the explosion
great clouds of dust and rock fragments billow out of the entrance hall
he whole mountain rumbles from the detonation
aline and carnby get to their feet outside the storm cellar
smoke pours out of the shaft
but as he sees where he really is carnby is stunned
he stares up at the orphanage
they were under us the whole time
carnby and aline walk through the orphanage
it is clean well maintained
but no one is there
the orphanage is empty
where are all the children
the door to the childrens room is ajar
carnby opens the door
carnby and aline stand at the doorway
sister clara lies dead on one of the childrens beds
the blankets and sheets are soaked with blood
a bloody gash has been sliced up each of sister claras arms
a blood stained straight razor sits on the bedside table
a crumpled piece of paper is clutched in one of sister claras hands
carnby takes the paper and uncrumples it
the notes reads forgive me edward
aline and carnby step out of the orphanage
carnby looks around troubled
no one is visible outside the orphanage
somethings very wrong
carnby and aline walk along a deserted street
the sun rises above them
its a beautiful day
shops look ready to open
cars are parked along the streets
but no one is driving
the neighborhood is empty
carnby and aline walk down a wide street in the middle of the citys downtown core
no one is visible anywhere
whats going on
carnby looks ashen
they stand in the middle of a downtown intersection empty streets stretching out in all directions
remember what hudgens said
i was his last failure
he said he perfected the implant process
it cant be
then where the hell is everybody
wheres everybody gone
we look down at carnby and aline alone in the intersection empty streets all around them
we start to float up above them getting a wider and wider birds eye view of the city
we swoop up higher above them but still no one is visible anywhere in the city
we float up until the entire city stretches out below us
no one can be seen
heres what i know
there are two worlds on this planet
a world of light and a world of darkness
for millions of years these worlds were in balance
but now the lights of human civilization burn everywhere
the dark places are disappearing
we forced them to come out of the shadows
now its my job to force them back in
my name is edward carnby
im here to protect you from things you dont believe in
we start to drop back down faster and faster the ground rushing towards us
we are descending directly above carnby and aline standing alone in the empty intersection
we swoop down right in front of carnby
his trench coat blows in the wind
aline stands next to him ready
carnby reloads his revolver
its going to be a busy day
the sun shines down above them illuminating the deserted city streets
carnbys expression is determined
