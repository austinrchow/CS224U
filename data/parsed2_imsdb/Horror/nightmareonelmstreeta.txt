a nightmare on elm street by wes craven wes cravens nightmare music theme begins as we fade up on a series of shots all close and teasing
a mans feet in shabby work shoes stalking through a junk bin in a dark fire lit ash dusted place
a huge boiler room is what it is although we only glimpse it piecemeal
then we see a mans hand dirty and nail bitten reach into frame and pick up a piece of metal
another angle as the hand grabs a grimey workglove and slashes at it with a straight razor until its fingertips are off
close on same hands dumping four fishing knives out of a filthy bag
their blades are thin curved gleaming sharp
more angles even closer
we can hear the mans wheezing breathing but we still havent seen his face
we never will
we just see more metal being assembled with crude tools into some sort of linkage a splayed spidery sort of apparatus against a background light of fire and a deep
rushing of steam and heavy dark energy
and then we see this linkage attached to the glove
then the blades attached to all of it
then the mans hand slips into this glove like apparatus filling it out and transforming it into an awesome deadly claw hand with four razor talons gleaming at its blackened
suddenly the hand arches and strikes forward slashing through a dark canvas tearing it to shreds
a pulsation of light and shadow
music drops away to a hushed rushing of wind and distant sirens
camera racks into focus on a high panorama of the san fernando valley its night sky lit from within by a strange greenish light
camera tilts down and zooms swiftly into the valleys web of light
titles continue as tina gray a strong girl of fifteen in a thin night shift moves towards us down a dark concrete corridor
her steps quicken as titles appear in the portion of frame she leaves free
a subliminal collage of sound threads in and out of the music
distant insane laughter
slamming iron doors
a bleating animal cry
a lamb white and blank faced skitters across her path and on into the dark
no reason why its there
then another sound much nearer the slithering scrape of something like fingernails across slate
it sets our teeth on edge twists the music and sends tina running
suddenly tinas a tiny figure running among huge boilers steam pipes and catwalks a shadowed forest of iron and stone
she stops listening intently as the sound of tiny hooves suddenly turns into the rattle of distant rain
then she hears ripping fabric
someone is shouldering behind a ragged screen of dirty canvas approaching tina
closer on the canvas
the long curved fingerblades suddenly punch through flashing in the firelight and begin ripping through the thick fabric as easily as scalpels through flesh
they make a hideous extended ripping sound
tina rushes away hands over her ears
another angle as the blinded girl stumbles backwards
then the canvas flaps free
the blades are gone
the titles end and everything goes silent
camera circles until tinas looking right into our eyes
the light from a nearby boiler pours through her thin night dress leaving her naked and vulnerable
then a deep ragged voice whispers at her as camera closes in on her face
one two freddies coming for you
tina opens her mouth to scream but only a dry yellow dust pours out
and at that precise moment a huge shadowy man with a grimey red and yellow sweater and a weird hat pulled over his scarred face lunges at her
and its his fingers that are tipped with the long blades of steel glinting in the boney light and giving the hulk the look of an otherworldly predator
tina dodges away her legs suddenly elephantine and slow
the man seizes the trailing hem of her nightgown and hauls her back
the music shrieks as tina manages to tear free the man lurches after her with a hoarse shout as we tina convulses in bed with a scream looking around wildly
someone is knocking on her door
you okay tina
tinas mother sticks her head in with a worried look
tina sits up and blows out a breath groggy
just a dream ma
more to herself damn dream is all
the woman once attractive ventures a step into the room
a man hovers background
tinas mother waves him away without looking shoving a strand of bleached hair from her eyes
she appraises her daughter
some dream judging from that
she nods at tinas nightshift
tina looks down at her nightgown only now aware of the chill penetrating it from the room
there are four long slashes up its middle cleanly cut as if by scalpels
distant annoyed you coming back to the sack or what
hold your horses
lower to tina as she stands to leave you gotta cut your nails or stop that kind of dreaming tina
one or the other
the woman shuts the door behind her
tina looks back to her nightgown
low oh shit
she suddenly snatches up the cross that hangs over her head her face white as her sheet
singing one two freddies coming for you
three four better lock your door five six grab your crucifix
fade up on shot of this large highschool and its crowds of students
foreground tina climbs out of a cherry red cadillac convertible with two other students best friend nancy wilson and nancys boyfriend and owner of the car glen lantz
foreground several gradeschoolers are playing jump rope and the old ditty they sing continues unbroken from tinas bedroom
seven eight gonna stay up late
nine ten never sleep again
moving angle favoring nancy
shes a pretty girl in a letter
sweater with an easy athletic stride and the look of a natural leader
glen holding her hand wears one of the schools football jerseys a good natured bright kid
tinas in mid conversation
referring to kids song thats what it reminded me of that old jump rope song
shudders worst nightmare i ever had
you wouldnt believe it
matter of fact i had a bad dream last night myself
tina turns to nancy but before either can say more rod lane a lean richard gere sort in black leather and new wave studs joins up with them and interupts
to tina had a hardon this morning when i woke up tina
had your name written all over it
tina cracks her gum with a look of withering indifference
theres four letters in my name rod
how could there be room on your joint for four letters
the guys stopped in his tracks
hey up yours with a twirling lawn mower
he cuts off across the lawn
rod says the sweetest things
hes nuts about you
tina makes a face and rakes her fingernails across a tree as she passes
yawns anyway im too tired to worry about the creep
couldnt get back to sleep at all
beat so what you dream
forget it the point is every body has nightmares once in a while
next time you have one just tell yourself thats just all it is right while youre having it yknow
thats the trick
once you do that you wake right up
at least it works for me
tina looks at glen sharply
he kisses nancy and darts off for class
you have a nightmare too
but glens gone
maybe were gonna have the big earthquake
they say things get weird just before that
bells are ringing and students crowding tina and nancy are drawn into the crush
angle on a modest home no car just a couple of bikes in the drive
every light in the house and yard is turned on
we hear the rock group madness played at a no adults home volume
on glen dialing
nancy and tina are watching giggling
i cant believe his mother let him come over here
well she didnt exactly
glen shoves a cassette into tinas ghetto blaster
to tina see i got this cousin who lives near the airport that its okay for me to stay with right
so i found this sound effects tape at licorice pizza and
the phone is answered
glen jerks the tone arm off the record with a scruupt
pushes the play button yeah out here at barrys
a jet plane begins to make itself heard on the tape
glen moves the machine closer to the phone
its a big plane sounds like a coming in for a landing
yeah noisy as usual
glad we dont live here huh
yeah aunt eunice says hello
the jet is screaming in now full flaps and howling like a monstrous banshee
nancy and tina dissolve into muffled giggles
shouting over the din right right ill call you in the morning
yeah sure i huh
suddenly the tape goes silent
next moment another engine is heard but this one is a ford lotus screaming by at mph
reacting to his mothers reaction uh
some kids drag racing outside i think
the sound effect changes abruptly to a speeding sedan and the ages old screech of brakes last second scream and horrible collision
nancy gamely tries to find the right button to turn it off but misses
theres a loud screek of fast forward mayhem glen improvises desperately
listen mom i got to go i think theres been an accident out front i nancy jumps back from the cassette player world war ii bursts out at top volume
machine guns hand grenades diving bearcats and shouts of charging huns
glen makes a last ditch dive and flings the cassette out of the machine
blessed silence at last
ill call the police
no just some neighbors having a fight i guess
im fine im fine
call you in the morning
he hangs up and sags back
worked like a charm
tina shoves another cassette in and michael jacksons thriller blasts from the stereo
the kids relax the camera glides past the wind is moving the bare tree branch outside
camera pans back to the comfortably threadbare room uneasy
we see nancy poking at a flame in the hearth as tina comes foreground to draw the drapes
nice to have a fire
turn er up a little
nancy turns a nearby valve handle and the gas fire climbs brightly over its artificial log
tina joins her heartened
maybe we should call rod have him come over too
he might get jealous
rod and i are done
hes too much of a maniac
he should join the marines they could make something out of him
like a hand grenade
tina laughs despite herself
youve forgotten the bad dream
didnt i tell you
tina shakes her head wishing she had forgotten
all day long i been seeing that guys weird face and hearing those fingernails
nancy looks up with a flinch
blinks laughing thats amazing you saying that
it made me remember the dream i had last night
tina looks up
what you dream
i dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater i dream in color yknow he walked into the room i was in right right through the wall
like it was smoke or something and just stared at me
sort of obscenely
then he walked out through the wall on the other side
like hed just come to check me out
the story has left the room deathly quiet
especially tina seems effected
quietly so what about the fingernails
nancy remembers imitating the frightful coincidence
he scraped his fingernails along things actually they were more like fingerknives or something like hed made them himself
anyway they made this horrible nose imitates sssssccrrrtttt tina pales
you dreamed about the same creep i did nancy
the girls stare at each other
they look at him
he looks away as if suddenly listening
theres somebody out there isnt there
i didnt hear anything
then theres an unmistakeable sound
a distinct scraping against the house just outside the window
something multiple thin and sharp
something like metal fingernails
nancys mouth opens a fraction of an inch
close on front door as a bolt unlocks a key turns a chain is removed
at last the door swings open and glen swaggers out
im gonna punch out your ugly lights whoever you are
no answer but a slight rustle in the bushes
glen does a and walks right back inside
the girls prod him right back out giddy with giggling fear
its just a stupid cat
then bring us back its tail and whiskers
the girls push him farther
glen edges towards the shadows
then the scritching again
glen stops tina edges back into the house
anyway i dont have a cat
angle into the shadows
turned from the girls glen sobers listening
in his pov we see the street
motionless trees on empty lawns
chow chow chow
not a living or dead soul
glen turns back to the girls with a shrug
instantly a large figure pounces and throws him to the ground with a shout
the girls scream in panic and run for the house
reverse rod leaps up and shouts like a sportscaster
and its number thirty six rod lane bringing lantz down just three yards from the goal with a brilliant tackle
and the fans go wild
rod dances into the light flashing a wild gypsys grin at tina
the girls relieved and frightened at the same time
what the hell you doing here
came to make up no big deal
your ma home
rod takes the spindly hand rake hes found and scraps the houses wall
it makes a terrible scriiitching sound
he grins and tosses it aside
sizes up the three so whats happening an orgy or something
maybe a funeral you dickhead
rod wheels a knife suddenly in his hand as if ready to take glens throat out
nancy breaks between just a sleep over date rod
just tina and me
glen was just leaving
rod eyes glen laughs and flips the knife closed and away putting his arm around tinas shoulder and laughing as if its all a great joke
you see his face
lower your ma aint home is she
to nancy glen me and tina got stuff to discuss
he pulls tina inside without further ceremony
but rods already got himself and tina halfway through the living room heading into the darker part of the house
we got her mothers bed
you two got the rest
we should get her out of here
tina darts to the front door her blouse half out
hey you guysre hanging around right
fake laughing whine dont leave me alone with this lunatic pleeeeze nancy
glen looks at nancy
so well guard her together
through the night
moving closer in each others arms like we always said
i mean were here for tina now not for ourselves
she kisses him lightly then pushes him back
frustrated whys she so bothered by a stupid nightmare anyway
because he was scary thats why
who was scary
nancy turns and looks at him
dont you think its weird her and me dreaming about the same guy
glen looks away nancy stares closer you didnt have a bad dream last night did you
glen gives her a funny look
i dont dream
he takes her inside
over the sounds of locks falling shut we fade up on an old s clock one of those set into the black plaster body of a stalking panther
its just past am
pan the cold hearth and darkened living room to reveal glen on the couch cacooned in sheets
hes listening miserably to the sounds of lovemaking coming from the next room
tina peaks rod howls
this is a slightly larger room than tinas
spare in its appointments
the streetlight throws the narrow bed into broken shadow and light
tina and rod lie in each others arms in the middle of the big bed
i knew there was sometihng about you i liked
rod yawns into the pillows happy
you feel better now right
jungle man fix jane
no more fights
no more fights
no more nightmares for either of us then
he pulls the covers over his head
hes almost out already
beat when did you have a nightmare
under the blankets guys can have nightmares too yknow
you aint got a corner on the fucking market or something
he rolls over practically snoring and pulls another cover over his head
a dirty red and yellow cover
sleepily whered you get this snotty old thing
snores from rod
tina yawns turns off the light and snuggles against rod pulling the cover gingerly over herself too
camera moves across the room of the original nightmare to find nancy alone in tinas bed staring at the slanting ceiling above the bed
we can just hear her heart beating
she sighs and turns on her side
immediately the wall above her head turns a faint reddish hue with a broad yellow smear across its center
all unseen by nancy the wall begins to pulse in exact time with her hearts beat
close on nancys face
she closes her eyes
presses against the surface from the inside
the plaster buldges out as if suddenly elastic taking the shape of the thing pressing from inside taking the shape of a mans face the face opens its mouth
the knives rake through the surface
angle on nancy as plaster dust snows down on her
she jerks awake sitting bolt upright
the face retracts suddenly the wall is normal
angle down on nancy as she looks up to the ceiling touching her hair and feeling the plaster dust
reverse in her pov to the ceiling
there are three parallel cuts in the plaster there
about eight inches long
as if cut by sharp knives
back on nancy
she draws the covers around her and shivers
eyes wide open
not a car or person in sight
a stricken breeze dies in the trees
zoom in on the window of the room where tina sleeps
by the time
were full in close on it the air is again still as death
a moment later a pebble bounces off the pane
the nightmare theme appears in the lower registers and holds its breath
another pebble strikes with a sharper rap
close on tinas face as her eyes open
reverse in her pov
another pebble clatters off the glass
tina raises slowly
snores from rod
tina sits up
past her to the window
the wind moves again the trees brush the window with their shadows
then another pebble
tina slips to the window
she looks out on an old yard with a patch of bananna trees rattling in the santa ana winds
it seems deserted though the welling dark wont let her be sure
then another pebble pap
hitting with a sharp rack focus
a low angle to window as tina jumps back startled
seen that one coming
but shes drawn back to the glass out of curiousity straining to see in the dark
its as if the stones are materializing out of thin air
this time a heavier stone and a thin crack bristles across the glass
low who the fuck you think you are whoever you are
appears in the doorway
listening somebody there
she can see through the backward to a yawning gate and the back alley
no one there
but a word is spoken as if by wind
tina straightens unable to swallow
theres a ragged obscene giggle
deep in the throat
who the hell is that
tina charges across the yard and through the gate the music chasing after
she brakes in the middle of the alley and whirls around
shivering in the same thin slashed nightgown
a sharp crank of metal and fifty feet down the alley the lid of an ash can rolls from the dark like a huge tin coin and spirals noisily down
low reverse across lid to tina
despite herself she comes over
and touches it
she comes up with long worms on her fingers
next moment the exact same shambling man from her nightmare staggers into view fifty feet behind her
tina falls back into the shadows shaking the worms off her fingers in repulsion
the man turns and starts directly for her something shining on his right hand as he spreads his arms wide
he starts scraping the steel fingernails along a cinderblock wall
orange sparks spurt out his arms elongate until they reach from one side of the alley to the other and tina is cut off from her home
close on her as the scraping of the blades gets louder and closer
she begins to shake uncontrollably
oh shit please god
softly approaching this is god
he holds up his steel tipped hand like a surgical steel spider
tina runs for her life
wider angle in the alley a terrifying all out footrace
between the girl and her pursuer
the man is fast the distance between them closes with each heartbeat
tina overturns ashcans claws her way through a rotten back fence hammers against a window
ashen faces appear recoil pull curtains closed and disappear in fright
tina runs out onto front lawns screaming for help
no help comes
in fact the only response is for all the porch lights on the block to be turned off
the man roars out from behind a tree a tree too narrow to have hidden him nearly upon the girl
tina runs in panic at last making her own home only to be trapped against its locked front door
she hammers against its thick wood
open the door nancy
the man slows
he has tina now and knows it
shes still awake
nancy cant hear you
tina turns and looks full at the approaching man
smudged by deep shadow hes big and hideous
he wears the same dirty yellow sweater from the first nightmare from the wall hanging and blanket too and has the same sagging hat and leering grin over his misshapen
and on his fingers are the steel talons
close on him as he takes the blade on the end of his right index
finger and lopes off one of the fingers of his left hand
we see the pieces of fingers fall past tinas face in angle on the ground of the fingers squirming on the ground one flopping onto tinas naked foot
tina leaps back sickened and begins stamping on then as if they were huge bugs
the man snaps up his arm and the fingers fly back into place on his hand
he leers at tina then suddenly lunges at her sweeping with his cutting hand
tinas no weak sister blocks his arm deflecting the spines and grabs the mans ugly face with her other hand
but the face only slides off to the bone the man presses in and tina contorts in horror as the knives slash across her shoulder cutting her deeply
tina staggers backward groaning her foot now inexplicably a
caught in bedclothes
she falls over her beds conformter twists away from the man and like a child pulls the cover over her
the skull faced man crushes down and theres a fierce grappling punctuated by his grunts and the girls deafening screams and they both become totally wrapped in the comforter until
theyre beneath it fighting for life and death
rod lurches up into close up in the lightless bedroom half awakened by the tremendous struggle somewhere somehow inside the dark bed
rod grabs groggily lifting the blanket
in his pov we glimpse the dark underside of the blanket see a
two shadowy figures flailing and clawing under the bedspread tina and the man or a shape that could be a man raging against each other
rod drops the blanket and leaps from the bed scared full awake and terrified
then the horrible tinas gasps change to the cries of a terribly wounded victim
rod instantly jerks back the bedspread
in his pov we see tina struggling and flailing along on the sheets the man nowhere in sight
suddenly tina eyes turned inward to her tormentor give an awful jolt her arms and legs are spraddled as if by overwhelming force and pinned to the bed
next instant her nightgown flies apart and four long gashes chase across her torso
from no visible instruments
a huge irrigation of blood floods the bed
terrified rod dives for the light but at the same moment something invisible grabs tina wielding her body in the air and bringing it around in a swift blow that
knocks rod crashing into the light smashing it to bits
closer on him as he struggles around
in the blue flashes of
electricity rod sees tina sliding up the bedroom wall in a dark smear dragged feet first angle on rod paralized by terror
angle on tinas dying eyes moving with her up the wall and bumping around the corner onto the ceiling
shes just looking at whos dragging her eyes glazing
reverse in her pov to the shadowy horrendously ugly man dragging her with fierce glee across the ceiling literally swabbing the ceiling with her bloody body
seen in forced perspective the shot carries her across a great distance without seeming to get anywhere as if the ceiling is an endless plane
angle down on rod on his hands and knees the lamp next to him blurting blue sparks and strobing the nightmare room
rods screaming up at tinas invisible tormentor
what the hells going on here
angle on tina upside down clawing at the hanging swag lamp above her mothers dressing table desperate for some anchor
but shes dragged away from it
the lamp swings back its wires gushing more sparks
closer along the ceiling as tina rakes a long furrow in the ceiling with her fingernails
but her eyes are glazing glazing
and then they fall closed
wide up on the ceiling as her body suddenly flops loose hanging for an awful moment by the feet over the bed
reverse on rod staring like a terrified child
tina reverse in his pov as the body falls like a sack of rocks onto the devastated bed in slow motion striking with a huge splash of blood
a sick awful giggle floats around the room then echoes off into infinity
rod staggers up staring around as if hoping to see this phantom
you motherfucker ill kill you for that
nancy is sitting straight up in bed terrified
the cries of rod are ringing through the whole house
she forces herself to move bolting from the bed despite her terror and sense of dread
nancy flies into the dark hall crashing directly into someone who lurches out of the dark before her
she screams and jumps back what the hells going on
oh jeez glen
rods gone ape
sobbing ill kill you
nancy grabs the door its locked she pounds on it
things fall into sudden awful silence on the other side
glens voice cracks with fear
silence rod you better not hurt tina
rod erupts into terrible hoarse laughter and sobbing
then they hear breaking glass
glen barrels into the door like the football player he is
the frame splinters and theyre in
just inside the door nancy slips and goes down hard
glen finds her in the dark more by touch than sight
something slippering all over here
the room is quiet as a tomb
except for a stead dripping from all over
then glen finds a light switch
on the click the devastation is revealed
theres blood everywhere up the walls over the clawed ceiling soaking the killing floor of the bed and pooling in the dark red puddle where nancy has slipped and fallen
nancy wobbles up and sees tina in the center of the ravaged bed
unmistakeably and utterly dead
nancy presses against the wall then contorts and chokes
im gonna call the cops he bursts from the room
tight on nancy
she turns away from the body in repulsion
sticking her head through the shattered window rod lane used for his escape sucking in the cold night air and moaning
fade up on red lights and siren as an unmarked police car speeds to the curb
lt don thompson a decent looking man in his mid s exits and punches a cigarette from his pack
his shaken aide a uniformed patrolman named parker greets him
camera follows them from the car straight into the station and eventually to thompsons lieutenant thompson
sorry to wake you but idve canned your ass if you hadnt
what you got
parker stumbles to open the door for thompson as the man bulls into the station at a furious pace
her name was tina gray
it was her home
father abandoned ten years ago mothers in vegas with a boyfriend
were trying to reach her now
lt thompson grimaces as if he knows the story
whats the coroner got to say
something like a razor was the weapon but nothing found on the scene
thompson is already to the desk officer sergeant garcia
the big man shoves him a sheaf of papers wary leautenant
you know who where is she
i put her in your office
parker scurries after
looks like her boyfriend did it
musician type arrests for brawling dope terrific
what the hell was she doing there
she lived there
i dont mean her omit
thompson enters his office and confronts nancy and her mother i mean you
accusingly to marge what the hell was she doing there
marge simson is in her middle thirties a good looking woman despite the hour and circumstances
hello to you too donald
thompson stops the steam suddenly out of him
the girl is a wreck and he winces to see it
thompson glances at parker and the other uniformed cops who are in the room
as a man they head for the door
theres no question who the boss is here
thompson turns to nancy
she fumbles a smile
how you doing pal
nancys dress is dark with dried blood her skin clammy and the color of paste
marge shoots her ex husband a worried glance
thompson pulls a chair close to nancy
i dont want to get into this now god knows you need time
hotter but id sure would like to know what the hell you were doing shacked up with three other kids in the middle of the night especially a delinquent lunatic
rods not a lunatic
you got a sane explanation for what he did
the girl is shredding a kleenex staring off
apparantly he was crazy jealous
nancy said theyd had a fight rod and tina
quietly it wasnt that serious
maybe you dont think murders serious nancy sits bolt upright in her chair her eyes flashing
she was my best friend
dont you dare say i dont take her death seriously
lower near tears i just meant their fights werent that serious
the girl holds the womans eyes a moment then looks away
to herself she dreamed this would happen
she had a nightmare about somebody trying to kill her last night
thats why we were there she was afraid to sleep alone
a tear splashes off the arm of her chair
shes been through enough for one night
you have her statement
the mother and daughter rise thompson raps on the door and parker opens it
to marge i suggest you keep a little better track on her shes still a kid yknow
marge wheels on him
you think i knew there were boys there
you try raising a teenager alone
then she and the girl are gone
thompson glares at parker
low to parker see they get home okay
parker shoves his hands in his pockets
on his face we fade up on marge simson opening a new bottle of gin pouring herself a careful shot drinking it then chasing it with coffee
nearby a tv drones the morning news
we cant yet see the screen
in the headlines this morning a local teenage girl was brutally murdered during an all night party
marge turns startled seeing nancy coming downstairs
the girl looks a little better than she did in the police station but her eyes are still red rimmed and a vacant stress masks her face
she looks to the tv
police say the victim fifteen year old christina grey had quarrelled earlier with her boyfriend rod lane a punk rocker with a history of delinquency
lane is now the subject of a city wide manhunt
according to a
the tv picture has begun featuring a handheld newsreel shot of a dark rubber body bag being carried to a coroners van
just before the thing is lifted inside tinas bloodied white arm slips from its zippered side and lolls into the dark night air
a man rudely shoves it back inside and pulls the zipper up the rest of the way
wider as nancy pales visible
marge darts to the tv and slaps it off then turning to nancy
she looks at the girl a moment then goes to her and hugs her
kind where you think youre going
i could hear you tossing and turning all night kiddo
youve no business going to school
nancy pulls away determined
i gotta go to school mom
otherwise ill just sit up there and go crazy or something
marge studies her face a moment
did you sleep
ill sleep in study hall promise
id rather keep busy you know
she absently drains the womans coffee cup then pecks her cheek
right home after
nancy contd right home after
marge watches the girl disappear outside then lights a cigarette from the one already burning in her fingers
music slips back in subtle but tense as we track with nancy as she walks alone down a sidewalk edged with thick flowering oleander
she cocks her head puzzled as if sensing something
nancy looks across the street
reverse in her pov
a man is over there in dark clothes reading a
a newspaper but really watching her
nancy shrugs and continues on then stops and looks back again
in her pov we see the man is gone
next moment with a music sting a bloodied hand jumps out d
from the opposite direction clamps over nancys mouth and drags her into the bushes
nancy struggles twisting against the powerful assailant
a wider angle reveals rod lane barefoot clad only in jeans and leather jacket still caked with dark blood
the rest of his skin is pale as a ghosts
im not gonna hurt you
he releases her warily
nancy makes no move to run or scream even though several students pass on the nearby sidewalk
this reassures rod just a little
your old man thinks i did it dont he
he doesnt know you
eyeing the blood couldnt you change
the cops were all over my house
shivers theyll kill me for sure
nobodys gonna kill you
he runs his hands down his face trying to believe that
the two study each other
i never touched her
you were screaming like crazy
nancy says this without accusation just cool observation
someone else was there
the door was locked from your side
rod grabs her hard
his muscular body tenses
dont look at me like im some kind of fucking fruitcake or something im warning you
the boy jerks around
nancys father his
leveled right at
rods belly eases out of the bushes
now just step away from her son
like your ass depended on it
im warning you rod backs away looking once at nancy with a look of terrible sadness
then he dives out of the bushes and runs like hell
thompson snaps his revolver to fire but instinctively nancy jumps between no
thompson jerks his gun into the air furious
jesus are you crazy
he plunges past the girl
rod races like a frightened animal across the lawns but is soon cut off by the planeclothesman nancy saw watching her before and then two uniformed policeman who close from
the chase is short and pitifully off balance and rod is soon wrestled to the ground
next moment one of the cops is holding rods knife into the air for thompson to see
thompson looks at nancy as if to say i told you
background rods shouts can be heard as hes shoved into a squad car
i didnt do it
fading i didnt kill her nancy
the cars door slams and rod is gone
nancy turns to her father livid
you used me daddy
exasperated what the hell you doing going to school today anyway your mother told me you didnt even sleep last night
nancy spins angrily and walks away
but she just keeps going
fade up on an english teacher and class nancy among the kids trying to concentrate
according to shakespeare there was something operating in nature perhaps inside human nature itself that was rotten a canker as he put it
the teachers eyes glance across the room
angle on nancy yawning but listening
of course hamlets response to this and to his mothers lies was to continually probe and dig just like the gravediggers always trying to get beneath the surface
the same was true in a different way in julius caesar
jon go ahead
she nods to a surfer whos been waiting uncomfortably in front of the class
he squints at his book and begins the recitation a struggle between baked and salted brain and the poetry of the bard
reading aloud uh in the most high and palmy state of rome
californias the most high and palmy state man
the surfer halts with a grin kids snicker
she glares them back into silence
the surfer starts over as we shes nodding off now barely able to keep her eyes open in the warm close boredom of the classroom
in the most high and palmy state of rome a little ere the mightiest julius fell
nancys head pitches forward she jerks it back up barely awake the graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the roman street
nancys head has sunk again eyelids drawn as if by enormous
by the time her cheeks against the desk the surfers voice is echoed and distant
but another voice tinas is very near very much present
a sad thin plaint
nancy gives a start
her eyes lock onto something
tilted sideways in her heads pov we look straight
out through the open doorway of the classroom into the hall
there standing in a black pool of fluid is a full sized rubber body bag
dark red and yellow
weaving slightly the merest suggesting of movement within it
back on nancy sitting upright wiping the sleep from her eyes
shaking her head like a punchy prozefighter
she looks back out the door
reverse in normal pov the hallway is empty
but theres a
dark smear on its floor tiles
nancy looks nervously towards the rest of the class
no one else
has noticed a thing outside the door
all are dumbly spellbound by the surfer who now recites like a deep voiced robot his face wreathed by white hair
o god i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams
angle back on nancy
she slips from her seat eye warily on the
teacher and class
but no one turns as she disappears through the doorway
nancy turns and looks both directions
no sign of anybody
nancy wheels and sees the bag prone on the tiles at the far end of the hall at the end of a long snails trail of slime
a pale hand thrusts out of it
a moment later as if pulled by invisible gravity the bag slides out of sight into an intersecting corridor
nancy starts running for it
angle at the corner as nancy races blindly around the turn and
smashes straight into a body lunging at her from the opposite direction
both go down
angle at the floor
a dazed freshman hallguard cranks herself up
on one elbow
she wears a plastic plaque on her red and yellow sweater that reads hall guard
her nose is bleeding from the impact
y youre not supposed to run
w wheres your pass you got a pass
nancy leaps up screw your stupid pass
she turns sees the body bag halfway down this darker narrower
hall upright again
but just as she sees it it tips and pitches headlong through a doorway like some godawful rotten tree finally timbering down
she can hear the sickening crunching of it falling down a long flight of stairs
nancy runs for it again
the hallguard staggers up foreground bleeding profusely from her eyes and ears
hey no running in the halls
the hallguard raises her hand and we see its tipped with long metal spikes
reverse angle at the door as nancy runs up
nancy turns to check out the hallguard
nancy turns and looks down through the open door
the music sweeps through a strange brooding movement of strings mounting towards the nightmare nancy edges into the stairwell and looks down
looks like theres a fire somewhere down there from the way the orange light dances
but theres only a low white noise
nancy starts down the stairs
nancy comes off the stairs into a dank boiler room
the smear trail is there
it runs behind a cracking red hot boiler the size of a diesel locomotive
everything about the place feels dreadfully wrong and the music is deep into the nightmare theme when it pauses
tight on nancy
slow terror moves into her face
theres a low sinister giggle
reverse in her pov we see a tangle of pipes shadows and the
tainted fire of the huge boiler
then from behind this deeply shadowed but still identifiable steps tinas killer
the same filthy red and yellow sweater and slouch hat the same melted face twisting into a smile the same garbled laugh as he slides the long blades from beneath
his shirt and fans them on the ends of his bony fingers
who are you
gonna get you
the leering man brings the bloodied scalpel fingernails across
his own chest splitting a nipple
yellow fluid pours out
maggots and worms
nancy forgets the question jerks around and flees in blind panic into the first opening she sees a dark pipe tunnel
angle in the narrow passageway
in the background the killer shambles towards her foreground nancy breaks into a run
the killer sprints nancy tears ahead into darkness
she flees deeper and deeper into the labyrinth of steaming sizzling pipes squeezing through smaller and smaller openings
the killer is just yards behind her and soon shes trapped just as tina was before her
she presses her back to the wet bricks
theres no hope of fighting him off for nancy is not as strong as tina
but she is smart as hell and thinking even in this nightmare
so by the time the creep has raised his knives to strike nancy has realized something
she wheels and shoves her arm against one of the scalding steam pipes
in the sme split second we hear her flesh scald we nancy lurches up screaming arm raised to ward off the invisible blow books clattering to the floor other girls
nearby scream in surprise as she stumbles over them
then she stops confused and groggy from the nightmare
everybody is staring at nancy as if shes gone mad
the english teacher rushes over herself frightened by the terror in the girls eyes
okay okay thompson
every things all right now nancy
nancy jerks around with panicked eyes expecting the killer to
leap from any direction
but theres only the sea of staring eyes
nancy begins methodically picking up her books
ill call your mother
no really im fine
ill go straight home
she marches for the door
youll need a hall pass
but the girls gone
nancy walks out of the building shaken
then she pauses at one of the big pine trees out front stops and rests her head against its bark teeth set
nancy starts to shake and next second shes sobbing like a broken hearted frightened child
but she shakes herself silent
wipes the tears away with a slash
she rubs her arm absently lost in thought then reacts in surprise and pain
she lifts her arm and stares at the spot shes touched
insert on her arm and the burn there about the size and shape of a half dollar
wider on nancy
utterly chillingly confused
tina against the tree inches from nancy sc turns to her and says couldnt get back to sleep at all
beat what you dream
nancy is walking quickly head erect jaw set
then she enters her fathers police station
nancy crosses directly to the garcia
my dad here
garcia looks up from his paperwork
lt thompson emerges from another room uneasy to see nancy
decide to take a day off after all
dad i want to see rod lane
thompson doesnt miss a beat
only family allowed nancy
you know the drill
just want to talk to him a second
you dont know he did it
no i know thanks to your own testimony that he was locked in a room with a girl who went in alive and came out in a rubber bag
nancy flinches her father shows the first signs of color in his neck
i just want to talk to him
beat lower please dad
thompson shifts almost imperceptibly towards garcia then turns back to nancy
make it fast
a guard exits pushing a cart of food trays
nancy waits warily until hes gone then looks back to rod lane
rod looks more like a captured coyote than a human haggard ribbed expecting poisoned bait
his hair is wet his clothes are borrowed jeans and work shirt
low and then what happened
i told you
reluctantly it was dark but im sure there was someone else in there under the covers with her
how could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it
how the fuck do i know
beat i dont expect you to believe me
nancy studies his encrypted eyes
surprisingly she looks like she just might believe him
she leans closer with a new thought
what he look like
you get a look at him
he looks away
well then how can you say somebody else was there
because somebody cut her
while i watched
now the place is so quiet you can hear heartbeats
somebody cut her while you watched and you dont know what he looked like
rod smiles an insane smile stuck with a reality no one will buy
you couldnt see the fucker
you could just see the cuts happening all at once
nancy gives a twitch
what you mean all at once
low i mean it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time
but invisible razors
by now hes picking at a clot of dark blood on his jacket as if it was a scab on his own body
then he catches nancy watching and turns away to the back of the cell
he smashes his fist into the wall bone crushing blows that scare the wits out of rod
he stops and his fist is dripping blood as he says in a small sad voice
i probably couldve saved her if id moved sooner
but i thought it was just another nightmare like the one i had the night before
was this guy who had knives for fingers
close on nancy unable to swallow the gorge rising in her throat
rod turns to her and to his surprise shes ashen
do you think i did it
fade up on establishing shot as a spooky wind sets a dog barking down the block
a car goes by then this pleasant residential street falls into silence
camera has moved in on nancys well tended two story home
the house is in shadow
alone marge scrapes the last of the evenings dishes and slips them into the dishwasher
neither she nor her daughter has touched the food
but marge is well into a bottle of gin her appetite for that is growing right along with her dread
she turns and looks up the stairs calling
nancy dont fall asleep in there
get into bed
nancys in the tub so drowsy she can hardly rinse without falling asleep
the water in the tub is opaque with suds
closer angle at water level on nancy
her eyes droop
she slides closer to the surface of the water letting its heat sooth her nerves
her eyes stare straight up glazed her breathing deepens
reverse across to her legs crooked one knee on each side of the tub
theres a ripple in the water between
then something tiny and shiny breaks the surface between them
it pops up with a slithering music cue and catches a sliver of light
then it begins to rise
higher and higher it rises soon accompanied by another then two more shining gleaming blades and then the full glove and dark hairy hand and then the wrist and arm
straight up light an evil sapling between the girls knees the knives bloosoming into a bright flower of razor sharp steel in the air moving over the girls belly
the hand rears back the claws arch to strike
marge raps on the door
the instant she does nancy jerks up opening her eyes groggily
the dark wet arm hand and knifes are gone
through the door youre not falling asleep are you
you could drown you know
mother for petesakes
it happens all the time
brighter ive got some warm milk all ready for you
why dont you jump into bed
fading im gonna turn on your electric blanket too
then shes gone into another room low warm milk
she slides down to water level again and sings softly thoughtfully to herself
one two freddies coming for you three four better lock your door five six grab your crucifix seven eight gonna stay up late nine ten never sleep again
the next instant shes jerked with incredible violence straight down beneath the surface of the tub as if the bottom had suddenly dropped out and she was in a bottomless
looking up past her ankles we see nancy pulled sharply down into really deep water the dim light of the surface and bathroom beyond receding with each yank
and yet she somehow flails and gasps and struggles back towards the surface managing by pure panic to break the surface with her hands
marge rushes to the door and listens alarmed at the wild splashing audible through the locked door
marges voice reaches to the girl who thrusts up through main force and breaks the surface with her head and shoulders
gasping and choking nancy breaks the surface of her bathwater like a drowning sailer getting one last chance
her mothers voice booms over her echoed and frantic and the loud banging on the door finally opens her eyes
she turns and calls gasping to her mother mommy
reverse on the door as marge using the old hangar through the doorhandle truck makes it into the room
she rushes across to the tub
nancy is staggering up in the bathwater again with solid porcelain beneath her feet
i told you
hundreds of people a year drown like that
the mother throws a towel around the gasping girl helps her from the tub and begins drying her like a child
nancy looks like shes likes paralized with some sort of weird dread
great not believing it for a minute to bed with you cmon
marge rushes out to get the room ready
nancy turns and looks at herself in the cabinet mirror then opens the medicine chest and begins a quick furtive search
closer as she takes out the box of no doz and slips it into her robe
nancy emerges from the bathroom yawning
marge follows as the girl plods obediently to her room
no television forget the homework no phone calls
and no school tomorrow either
you take a little vacation relax and rest for a change
marge offers a smile and a little yellow pill
take this itll help you sleep
nancy pops it in her mouth and swallows obediently
marge leans to her with a kiss
sleep tight dont let the bedbugs bite
marge goes out relieved
nancy closes the door leans against it and spits the pill into her hand
she tosses it straight out her window and takes a nodoz
a monster movie in black and white
no sound from the set
pull back to reveal nancy propped up in bed furtively watching
is she just thinking
a bedside clock reads pm
the girl yawns
she shakes herself violently and sits up straighter forcing herself to concentrate on the movie
on the television screen
a diver struggles to keep facing a a
large circling shark
her eyes droop shut then she jerks awake rattling b
her head as if it were a radio drifting off station
she tumbles out of bed throws open the window and takes a deep breath of the cool night air
high angle at second story level
nancy looks directly across the street to a lighted open window
its curtains sucked out and waving in the night breeze give the only motion to the deserted street
then someone pitches out of the dark at her
nancy gives a yelp then clamps her hand over her mouth as she recognizes glen balanced precariously on the rose trellis outside her window
saw your light on
thought id see how you were
she gets herself together barely
sometimes i wish you didnt live right across the street
shut up and let me in
you ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet
nancy looks over her shoulder to make sure her mother hasnt heard
glens already through her window and planted on her bed
nancy points to a chair
if you dont mind
glen crosses to the chair and plops down
i heard you freaked out in english class today
theres no maliciousness in his voice and the familiar frankness is actually comforting to nancy
guess i did
havent slept have you
nancy tries to smile but cant fake it very well
glen looks her over
you look dead and rained on if you want the ugly truth
and what you do to your arm
she shrugs trying to keep it casual
burned myself in englsh class
she hazards a look in the mirror and her jaw drops
mgod i look twenty years old
turning back to him you have any weird dreams last night
slept like a rock
pleased well at least i have an objective wall to bounce this off
off you believe its possible to dream about whats going to happen
you believe in the boogey man
one two freddies coming for you
rod killed tina
hes a fruitcake and you know it
you believe in anything
i believe in you me and rock and roll
and im not too sure about you lately
listen i got a crazy favor to ask
its nothing too hard or anything
beat im just going to
look for someone and
i want you to be sort of a
glen makes the twilight zone sound
beat i think
she comes very close to him
you wont screw up right
i mean a whole lot might depend on it
the way shes looking at him gives him the creeps
okay i wont screw up
nancy takes a deep breath
then without another word turns off
the tv and the light
jesus its dark in here
now listen heres what were gonna do
fade up on nancy still in her pajamas walking through the shadowy streets near her home listening for the slightest sound
we move with her
but nothing not even the dog barking earlier is there now
nancy peers into the darkness of lawns and trees behind her
stage whisper you still there
across the street and a distance away glen steps from behind a tree
just checking keep out of sight
glen throws up his hands in exasperation and walks back out of sight
nancy turns and looks down between the houses deep into a dark alleyway
then she forces herself to walk into it
moving with her as she makes herself go deeper and deeper into shadows
each time she pauses and waits the music grows more threatening and expectant
the feeling is of immense tension were sure the killer will come screaming out on her at any second
but he doesnt
in fact absolutely nothing happens and nancy emerges from the far end of the alley unscathed
the only thing strange is that she now finds her self looking across the mall to the police station
it takes her a little by surprise it just seems to have appeared
music creeps into the nightmare theme as nancy whispers hoarsely back down the dark alley
we only hear the distant voice slightly echoed
yawning still here
on your toes right
nancy stares into the dark trying to see him but she cant
she turns back and makes up her mind to move without him in sight
music mounts as we move with nancy across the lawns to the police station creeping to the first lighted window she sees
its a low barred basement window and nancy reacts as soon as she looks through it
nancys pov down into rod lanes cell
the boy is on his rough cot twitching in disturbed sleep
and a long shadow is sliding across the wall
a big shape appears in the shadowed corridor outside the boys cell and as it walks closer nancy can barely see its the shambling grimly scarred man with the filthy
red and yellow sweater and strange slouch hat pulled across his brow
the killer from all of their nightmares
and this giant shadow of a man passes through the bars of the cell like so much evil jello
halfway through he pauses turning to check over his shoulder
we see the bars clearly penetrating his body going in his head passing out his ankles
then he turns back to rod and moves forward and within another heartbeat is beside the boy
nancy draws back sharply swallowing in terror
she looks behind her for help
the street is absolutely deserted
there is no motion and no sound save one the distant but unmistakeable sound of glen a beat of silence after the shouts echoes die then the steady boyish snores
nancy swears under her breath and jerks back around forcing herself to look again into rods cell
in her pov the killer picks up rods bedsheet and tests it between his powerful hands
without thinking nancy bangs against the glass
the killer wheels around locking eyes with nancy
the girl goes white
the mans face is in the light and its horrible seething with hatred and a twisted insane intelligence
the hold of those eyes is only broken when rod rolls up on an elbow with a deep troubled groan
the instant rod does this the killer fades into the shadows in the cell
but even then his eyes hold on nancys until the last second hes visible
rod looks around the cell groggily runs his fingers through his matted hair then collapses back on his pillow
no matter how hard nancy screams rod never once looks at the window
he just pulls the twisted covers about his shoulders and succumbs once more to sleep
and now the bed sheet is no longer on the bed
the killer materializing out of the shadow again is holding it between his hands like a garrote
he looks up and leers at nancy then moves for rod
angle back on nancy
she pounds on the window then turns in frustration and yells into the night
she turns back to the cell in desperation
in nancys pov we look into a cell that is quite deserted save for rod
nancy pulls back from the window stunned
suddenly nancy feels utterly exposed
she shivers chilled and vulnerable to the bone in her thin night clothes
she cant move
its as if some great nerve between her instincts and body had been severed
and she hears the sound behind her
a sort of filling vibrating scrriiitchh music sneaks in the unmistakeable nightmare theme creeping over her
nancy forces herself by sheer will to look
ahead of her perhaps twenty five feet covered with a thick
plastic body bag through which we can barely see her face is tina
standing square in the middle of the street
a dark ooze of black eels roil out of its bottom and at its top the zipper chatters down and the greenish white face of tina lolls out
she gestures supplicating her watery eyes desperate to convey some desperate message
the music falls to a hush
nancy backs away eyes streaming tears
glen where are you
nancy twists around in horror at the same instant the killer grabs for her face with his knife fingers
the girl intinctively pitches back then scrambles up and runs like hell
moving with nancy at full gallop running blind
she crashes through a sawhorse into a new sidewalk sinking into the wet cement over her ankles
the stuff sticks to her legs in long gluey globs and she can barely pull her feet loose
the killer looms nearby mocking her his scalpel claws gleaming in the streetlight
he just misses the girl as she wrenches free and flees again now so winded she can only stagger
moving with them
time after time nancy just barely manages to elude the shadowy form leaping from his reach by inches and pouring on more steam
its too close to even bother screaming now and besides that would take breath she doesnt have
the only sound is of running footsteps rasping breath and the knife fingers whistling through the air
nancy tears across her front lawn and into the open front door of her home slamming it with all her might
theres a tremendously satisfying concussion of wood against doorframe and the locks fall shut
but her voice is garbled as if shes under water and theres no answer
the only clue to glen being there at all is his distant snoring
nancy stops breath in shreds face smeared with dirt and tears
something is clawing the window in the dark of the kitchen
nancy looks and catches the man prying at the glass with his big knife fingers the sharp blades sizzling against the edges of the glass as they crack it away
from the frame
nancy runs upstairs in blind panic
nancy darts into her unlit bedroom slams the door and locks it
safe at last
she listens at the door
she crosses to her bed
next second the killer dives through her window and seizes her in a shower of shattered glass nancy twists and manages to grab the wrist of his knife hand with
both of hers barely keeping the blades from her throat
the two fall backwards in a terrible gasping struggle crashing onto nancys bed
her grip is broken the man stabs nancy twists away backed into a corner of bed and walls
defenseless she snatches a pillow up the killer lashes out disemboweling the pilow and sending a great gush of feathers flying
nancy dives for escape in a virtual blizzard
the killer manages to snare her with his other hand and the two crash across the bedside table to the floor the table and all its contents cascading around them
in a whiteout of feathers
the blades inch towards the girls face the drool of the grizzled shadow with the horribly scarrred face spills into her eyes
feathers are everywhere music is absolutely insane
but just when the points of steel are less than an inch from her eyes the old fashioned alarm clock thrown to the floor next to nancys head goes off
with a jarring ringgggggg
instantly the music stops
and a moment later the room is
wider as nancy reels up blinded by the sudden light screaming on her bed angle on glen lurching from his own sleep at the frightening noise
he discovers nancy pressed in terror against her headboard clutching a pillow like a drowning woman would a straw
its an intact pillow and there isnt a feather in sight
nancy stares incredulously at glen then around the room untangling herself from her bedclothes
wary and furious her voice hoarse
glen you bastard
the boy looks at his friend in groggy alarm
shes absolutely livid more angry than hes ever seen her and more strange
what i do
he reaches for her she flattens against the wall eyes hard and terribly hurt too
low i asked you to do just one thing
just stay awake and watch me just wake me if it looked like i was having a bad dream
eyes wild but you
you shit what do you do you fall asleep
she stops herself wiping a bit of spittle off her lip alarmed at how out of control shes become
and suddenly she breaks sinking into her torn bedclothes and rubbing her head
mostly to herself i must be going nuts
her mothers door opens os
nancy composes her voice as best she can
marges flip flops approach outside the door
glen barrels out the window nancy dives for the bed jams off the light and disappears under the covers
marge bleary eyed herself opens the door and flicks on the light
beat you okay
just had a little dream
im falling right back to sleep
you need anything just call
marge closes the door
nancy immediately sits up and looks at the window
a single bone white feather floats down in the moonlight
then its sucked outside and is gone
glens cadillac convertable careens into the parking lot and screeches to a stop
glen and nancy jump out and head for the station
you mind telling me whats going on
nancys races into the station without answering
oh i see
that makes it all perfectly clear
nancy goes straight to the sergeants desk
garcia i want to see rod lane again
i thought when i took the night shift id have peace and quiet for a change
its urgent weve gotta see rod
its three in the morning
your mother know youre out this late
faking it of course look at least go back and look at him
just see if hes okay
garcia glances at glen
faking it we have reason to think there might be something weird going on
oh no argument on that
nancy jumps around at the sound of her fathers voice
lt thompson emerges from his office rumpled and yawning
dad what you doing here
it so happens i work here and theres an unsolved murder
i dont like unsolved murders especially ones my daughters mixed up in what are you doing here at this hour
youre supposed to be getting some sleep
listen sir this is serious
nancy had a nightmare about rod being in danger or something and so she thinks
he trails off loosing it under lt thompsons glare
besides he doesnt know exactly what the hells really going on himself
garcia puts his beefy hand on nancys shoulder
i just want to see if hes okay
take my word for it nancy
the guys sleeping like a baby
hes not going anywhere
angle on rod in his cell
hes asleep all right but not safely so
his bedsheet has come alive
it twitches pulsates then snakes towards his throat
rod stirs the sheet falls still rod slips into deeper sleep and the sheet moves again completing the noose around his neck
nancy makes a move for the cell block this isnt your average nightmare daddy damn it
the doors locked she hauls on it in desperation
now look nancy dont push it
youve already rubbed my nose in sex drugs and violence dont start throwing in insanity
nancy takes that one to heart
she wheels on him and pleads her intensity sobering even to him
just go back and check please the man takes a beat then shrugs and nods towards sgt garcia
what the hell
feeling in his pockets now whered i put the key
he mumbles backs towards his desk
music builds as we hold on with a terrible snap rods sheet jerks tight around his neck
the startled teenager is hauled upright eyes popping face purple
he claws at the sheet but despite his strength he cant get his fingers between the noose and his windpipe
hes dragged backwards across the cot
garcia finally has the keys
urged on by nancy he fumbles with the lock
rods being dragged backwards gasping and struggling in vain against the powerful pull right across his cell and up the wall too
he clutches blindly at his throat at the far end of the sheet coils around the bars of the high window
then theres a powerful wrench of the sheet and rods neck snaps
the kids body sags lifeless
angle through the bars as nany glen lt thompson and garcia
appear in the corridor outside the girl sprinting ahead
but its too late nancy sinks back in horror as her father and garcia rush into the cell
gimme a hand dammit
glen pale as the sheet thats killed rod climbs to the bars and unties the knot
rod slides down over the sergeants shoulders limp as a marrionette with its strings slashed
goddamn loco kid he didnt have tdo that madre dios
they lay rod at nancys feet a strange pieta
nancys father looks at her in spooked suspicion
howd you know he was gonna do this
nancy says nothing
fade up on a stark afternoon
on a hill of sere grass overlooking the valley the casket of rod lane is lowered into its grave
a small group of family and friends watches soberly as the minister raises his hand in benediction
ashes to ashes dust to dust
may god be with this young mans soul
on the faces of marge lt thompson tinas mother and rods parents
just for a second or two in looks too rapid for an outsider to even notice these adults exchange looks furtive quick glances that suggest an immense something that they
all share something beyond even this second death among their children
then they are all staring ahead again as if the others werent even there
his life and his death attest to the scriptures warning that he who lives by the sword shall die by the sword
angle on glen watching nancy standing alone not believing it for a minute
but let us recall also our lords admonition that we judge not lest we be judged
let us attempt only to love
and may rod lane rest in peace
quietly amen to that much
the mourners walk away from the grave marge among them
she pauses near a man and two women in black tinas mother rods parents
they almost it seems speak
then marge hurries on
we move with her as shes joined by lt thompson
both are worn and on edge
thompson absently lights another cigarette offering one to marge
hows nancy doing
i dont think shes slept since tina died
shakes her head shes always been a delicate kid
thompson lights her cigarette attempting some sort of nonchalance
shes tougher than you think
any idea how she knew rod was gonna kill himself
all i know is this reminds me too much of ten years ago
thompson blows a plume of smoke against the hard sky and looks away
lets not start digging up bodies just because were in a cemetery
he gives her a look that could cut stone
marge toses down her cigarete and crosses to nancy
the girl is simply staring off over the valley
very gently time to go home baby
she moves her away from the brink of the hill
marge opens the door of the station wagon for nancy
nancy turns to them both speaking in a still small voice
the killers still loose you know
she has a wild cassandra aspect that sends a chill right up marges spine
you saying somebody else killed tina
nancy smiles a weird sort of smile
i dont know who he is
but hes burned he wears a weird hat a red and yellow sweater real dirty and he uses some sort of knifes hes got made into a sort of
like giant finger nails
as nancy has described this monster from her dream unseen by her the faces of marge lt and thompson have drained completely of color
low even to marge i think you should keep nancy at home a few days
til shes really over the shock
i got something better
to nancy im gonna get you help baby
so no one will threaten you any more
she takes the girl by the arm and guides her into the car locking the door from outside
nancy never taking her eyes from her fathers as the car bears her away
fade up on uclas westwood campus and pan to sign a nurse applies sencors to the head breast arms and fingers of nancy thompson
the girl is lying on a simple broad cot in her pajamas
the room is subdued in color and holds only this single bed
a large mirror set into one wall hides an observation room beyond
but i just dont feel
ready to sleep yet
please do i have to
wider revealing dr samuel king a young curly haired internist
intelligent and wry
he treats nancy at all times like a young adult never patronizing
he winks as the nurse finishes
dont worry youre not gonna change into bride of frankenstein or anything
nancy manages a smile but shes haggard and visibly thinner
marge background looks downright distraught
nancy have any severe childhood illnesses
high temperatures concussions
he means did you ever drop me on my head
the doctor and girl share a nervous laugh marge doesnt even smile
nightmares are expected after psychological trauma
dont worry they go away
i sure as hell hope so
i dont see why you couldnt just give me a pill to keep me from dreaming
everyones got to dream
if you dont dream you go
he drills his finger at his temple all set
theyre just simple tests nan
well both be right here
look i know its been fright ening i know your dreams have seemed real
the girls gauges her mother the doctor the situation very carefully
then lowers her eyes
its not you i dont trust
gives up okay
lets do it
greatly relieved marge gives nancy a goodnight kiss then follows the doctor through a doorway near the mirror
as soon as her mother is out of sight nancys eyes drift to the mirror itself
in its reflection she sees herself looking back alone on the bed
marge and dr king overlook nancys sleeping chamber through the one way mirror
and king monitors the girl even more closely with a bank of instruments a mass of glowing dials graphs and meters
his manner with marge is slightly more sober
how longs this been going on
since the murder
she was fine before that
not to worry
no signs of path ology in nancys eeg or pulse rate
id guess what weve got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell
its just made her think
her dreams are real
king adjusts a dial watching the ekg like a hawk
ever hear the old buddhist tale about the king who dreamed he was a beggar who dreamed he was a king
then theres a slight alteration in the sound of the ekg
king nods in satisfaction
immensely relieved thank god
music rises solemnly majestically into a haunting transition as we
a montage of shots of the ekg graph its inky needles calming
of a meter tracing the quieting of nancys pulse and of other instruments indicating life processes we can only guess
all smoothing out
close on nancy on tv monitor asleep like the child she is
marge lights a cigarette angry at her helplessness
what the hell are dreams anyway
incredible body hookus pokus
truth is we still dont know what they are or where they come from
as for nightmares
leans closer did you know that in the last three years twenty philipino refugees in california died in the middle of nightmares
not from heart attacks either
they just died
he gives a ah don know shrug
marge looks out into the sleeping room
nancy is a motionless bundle in the middle of the bed
angle on a needle on an ekg dipping to a lower reading
wider angle the mother and doctor watching
that needle sank like a rock
quietly shes entering deep sleep now
heart rates a little high due to anxiety but otherwise shes nicely relaxed
she could dream at any time now
beat right now shes like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no ones mapped yet
waiting to see what shows up
we can see nancy drift from the initial stage over the brink into deep sleep
her hair falls into her eyes her face relaxes her shoulders curl round her like comforters
the music deepens and begins to hint at the tones of the nightmare theme
dr king and marge watch the instruments every move
one of the machines begins a slight chirping
king scans it liking what he sees
okay shes started to dream
he leans forward in his chair like a pilot starting an instrument approach
marge thompson licks her dry lips fighting a turn of nausea
how can you tell
rapid eye movements
the eyes follow the dream their movement picks up on this he prods a dial with his pencil and scribbles the time on a note pad
beta waves are slowing too
shes dreaming all right
a good one too
marge watches the tv monitor
its in extra close on nancys eyes and theyre darting beneath the lids reacting to events lost behind a skein of flesh and neurons
king points to a moving graph
a needles begun waving lazily between plus and minus three
the doctor nods assured
typical dream parameter
a nightmare now would be plus or minus five or six shes just around three point he stops
outside visible through the glass nancy twists around
eyes still closed shes nevertheless holding her head in the attitude of prey listening to the first faint sound of the predators approach
marge looks from her daughter to the doctor color draining from her face
what the hells this
she awake or asleep
the needle of the graph gives a jagged pitch up plunges then surges well above the eight mark
a strange music cue disonant and threatening creeps in the nightmare theme slurred into awful minors and weird disonance
king stares at the gauge in disbelief rapping his finger on its glass
it never gets this high
the needle swings even higher benind
hes cut off by the high pitched keening of the girl the sound cutting through the double thickness of the glass like a lasar
a warning beeper has begun the instruments light up like a christmas tree and outside in the sleeping room nancy is contorting as if shot through with a thousand volts
king knocks over his chair in his sprint for the door
the doctor and marge come in on the run nancys flailing and screaming as if the devil himself were after her
king grabs her to shake her awake angle on nancy eyes open looking in terror sound echoed in her pov dressed in kings clothes the horribly scarred man reaches out
wider nancys eyes closed in sleep as the girls fist shoots out with incredible force and knocks dr king flying
the nurse and marge both descend on her and again in her sleeping pov we see the man stagger for her
wider on nancy still in her nightmare fighting like a tiger with both marge and the nurse sending the nurse sprawling leaving marge hanging on for dear life
angle on the stunned doctor fumbling with a hyperdermic needle spilling most of the stuff on himself with his shaking hands the screams and curses of nancy are deafening and
worthy of a stevador fighting off his worst enemy
stranger still her hair is electrified standing on end and greying before their very eyes marge screams at the top of her lungs
some deep bolt of psychic power smacks through the girl and her eyes flap open theyre glazed with terror and fury but open
she stares around like a cornered animal in the middle of the bed her purple face gasping out gut wrenching sobs
the nurse and marge dare to go back in and hold the sweat drenched girl as dr king comes for her with the needle
now this is just going to let you relax and sleep nan with incredible swiftness nancy backhands the hypodermic into a far wall shattering it into a million pieces
thats enough sleep
her eyes are windows straight into white fire as she locks into kings face
he dabs his split lip swallowing painfully
he holds out his hand
nancy at last takes it and sags back into her pillow exhausted
then king comes up with blood on his hand
he stares at it dumbfounded then at the girl
across her left forearm a deep gash is bleeding freely as if made by a very sharp instrument
oh my god oh my god
to the nurse get the kit
the nurse scrambles away as the doctor claps his hand over the wounds
he looks into nancys face
what he sees frightens him even more nancys haunted ghost like eyes turn from him to her mother and a terrible chilling smile opens across nancys white lips
you believe this
she pulls her free arm from beneath the sheets and reveals a strange hat filthy and worn the killers hat
the sight of it frightens marge more than anything thats come before
deathly pale where the hell did you get that
nancy fixes her with xray eyes
i grabbed it off his head
marge stares at the hat as if it held her whole future and her future was a horror
fade up on nancys house early morning
marge is on the telephone the dirty hat in her hand
nearby is a nearly empty bottle of gin
she said she snatched it off his head in a dream
listens no im not crazy ive got the damn thing in my hand
listens i know we did we all
hears nancy approaching gotta go
she hangs up and stuffs the hat and bottle into a drawer screening the action with her body
by now the girl has an extraordinary look
her hair is ashen her skin transluscent and eyes dark ringed
her right forearm is heavily bandaged over the slashes
in short instead of the girl next door we now could be looking at the lunatic from the next cell
marge though she does her best to hide it is downright frightened of her
you didnt sleep did you
the doctor says you have to sleep or youll nancy pours herself a cup of black coffee
go even crazier
i dont think youre going crazy and stop drinking that damn coffee
did you ask daddy to have the hat examined
i threw that filthy thing away i dont know what youre trying to prove with it but nancy comes closer her eyes shining with a new sureness
what i learned at the dream clinic thats what im trying to prove
rod didnt kill tina and he didnt hang himself
its this guy hes after us in our dreams
but thats just not reality nancy
furious nancy janks open the drawer before marge can stop her
and spills the bottle and hat onto the counter
marge grabs away the bottle protectively but its the hat nancy goes for
she waves it triumphantly demonically
its real mamma
horrified put that damned thing down
marge lunges for it nancy leaps out of reach his name is even in it written right in here fred krueger fred krueger
you know who that is mamma
you better tell me cause now hes after me
marge swallows then persists in the lie
nancy trust your mother for once youll feel better as soon as you sleep
nancy shoots a hard humorless laugh holding up her slashed arm
you call this feeling better
or should i grab a bottle and veg out with you avoid everything happening to me by just getting good and loaded marge slaps her hard
losing it fred krueger cant be after you nancy hes dead the room falls silent both women staring at the other
low raw fred krueger is dead
dead and gone
believe me i know
now go to bed
i order you go to bed
marge snatches the hat away
nancy is furious betrayed
you knew about him all this time and youve been acting like he was someone i made up
marge pulls away
youre sick nancy
you need to sleep its as simple as that
nancy wheels and smashes marges bottle of gin in the sink
but nancy runs past her mother for the front door
nancy its only a nightmare
nancy turns in the doorway
thats enough on the door slam we angle on a neighborhood street
we hear glens voice and pan up to reveal nancy and glen high above two tiny figures walking across this strange white bridge in old los angeles
camera whenever i get nervous i eat
and if you cant do that you sleep
glen jams more big mack into his face
by now our zoom reveals hes attacking a huge bag of big macks and furtively eyeing nancy
the girls hair is startlingly white in the sunlight
shes reading a book hardly paying attention
you ever read about the balinese way of dreaming
they got a whole system they call dream skills
so if you have a nightmare for instance like falling right
instead of screaming and getting nuts you say okay im gonna make up my mind that i fall into a magic world where i can get something special like a
poem or song
grins hopefully they get all their art literature from dreams
just wake up and write it down
he stops seeing the look on nancys face
our zoom is much closer now a wide medium and still coming in on the kids
and what if they meet a monster in their dream
they turn their back on it
grins hopefully takes away its energy and it disappears
what happens if they dont do that
shrugs i guess those people dont wake up to tell what happens
she leans over the railing poking her face back into her book
glen tips its cover and reads its title
our zoom is still moving closer a medium close up now
booby traps and improvised anti personel devices
i found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on ventura
shocked well what you reading it for
our zoom locks in on a tight two on their faces nancys grimly determined
im into survival
she walks away out of frame leaving glen watching after her in astonishment
shes starting to scare the living shit out of me
angle across nancys tree lawn the grass between the sidewalk and the street in the general direction of glens home
this angle doesnt quite reveal nancys house
foreground is a utility truck in which a half dozen hispanic workers are loading tools extension cords and hardware
they look like theyve put in one hell of a hard days work
marge appears and hands a check to the foreman of the crew a white guy in clean coveralls and a gold chain
he scrutinizes it
and the other
marge forks over a wad of cash hands trembling in her half drunk helpless rage
wheres your mask and gun
the foreman counts the money swiftly
dont bust my chops lady
if the city found out i put em in without inside releases id loose my license
he shoves the money in his pocket and climbs in his truck
marge exits frame for her house
pan with the truck as it pulls away then pick up nancy walking across the street from the corner
she lifts her eyes to her home and stops in her tracks
widening to reveal the house as nancy walks across her front
every single window has been covered with brand new ornamental iron bars bolted deeply into their frames closer at a window
nancy gives a set of bars a powerful shake
they dont budge
then girl looks up and sees even the window to her second floor bedroom is barred
and the rose trellis has been ripped down and heaped at the foundation in a tangle of wood thorns and broken flowers
angle on the doorway into the hall
easy listening music wafts through the air
nancy appears in the doorway
mom whats with the bars
reverse to marge propped against the headboard of her bed a
crooked shadow in the gloom
a fresh bottle of gin glints in her hand
the girl crosses and reaches gently for the bottle
marge snatches it away
she rocks the bottle in her arms
whats with the bars
nancy sits on the bed a surprising compassion entering her voice
mom i want to know what you know about fred krueger
dead and gone
i want to know how where if you dont tell me im going to call daddy
marge gives a laugh a rasping chachination from deep in her chest
your father the cop
thats a good one
colder forget fred krueger
you dont want to know believe me
do want to know
hes not dead and gone hes after me and if i sleep hell get me
ive got to know
marge blinks at her a moment then cracks a terrible crooked grin
marge drags nancy headlong down the cellar stairs and across the room with a crazy fury twisting her down near the foundation
and she thrusts her face so close to her daughters that nancy reels from the alcohol
you want to know who fred krueger was
he was a filthy child killer who got at least twenty kids kids from our area kids we all knew
it drove us all crazy when we didnt know who was doing it but it was even worse when they caught him
marge draws herself up with a shake
oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place and fred krueger was free just like that
so hes alive
marge smiles grimly
he wouldnve stopped
the bastard wouldve got more kids first chance he got they found nearly ten bodies in his boiler room as it was
but the law couldnt touch him
at the mention of boiler room nancy gives a shake
marge misses this too busy taking a pull on the bottle thats never left her hand
what was needed were some private citizens willing to do what had to be done she reels slowly looking at nancy is defiance
hushed what did you do mother
marge cradles the bottle
bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go
found him in an old boiler room just like before
saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore drunk an asleep with his weird knives by his side
dreading it go on
marge reaches over and taps a dusty two gallon jug of gasoline near the lawn mower
we poured gasoline all around the place left a trail out the door locked the door then
she mimes striking a match her arms shoot up and her eyes go wide with the light of that fire
theres awe in her voice
then she drops her arms
hushed remembering but just when it seemed not even the devil could live in there any more he crashed out like a banshee all on fire swinging those fingerknives every
which direction and screaming he
he was going to get us by killing all our kids
she stops with a sudden quake and drinks for a long moment
but the intake doesnt hide the image
her face bathed in tears she looks at her daughter and shakes her head
there were all those men nancy even your father oh yes even him
but none could do what had to be done krueger rolling and screaming so loud the whole state could hear no one could take your fathers gun and kill him
good and proper except me she sweeps her hand across the air in a terrific slash then stops her hand shaking her voice hoarse and terrified
she looks at her daughter begging
so hes dead nan
he cant get you
mommy killed him
for someone who started this film at a very young seventeen nancys now the battle tempered veteran as she takes her mother in her arms and rocks her
who was there
were tinas parents there
marge sags back
sure and glens
all of us
but thats in the past now baby
slyly we even took his knives
the woman twists around and opens the door on an old furnace a furnace unused since the newer gas one nearby was put in
she fishes inside the cavity as then we hear a touch of the familiar scrriitch
next moment she pulls out an object wrapped in rags opens it and displays the long rusted blades and their glove like apparatus
nancy stares at the damn things chilled
all these years youve kept those things buried down here
in our own house
proof hes declawed
as for him we buried him good and deep
marge shoves the knives into their hiding place closes the little iron door
sos okay you can sleep
she lurches up and staggers upstairs
nancy shivers and looks down at her arm
the cut beneath her bandage has begun to bleed again
and from inside the furnace as if from deep below the pulsing of the boundless nightmare boiler room can be faintly heard
wide on the street and both houses glens on the right nancys on the left
a telephone rings
zoom in on glens upstairs
glen yawning crosses and picks up his telephone
nancy telephone hi
hi how ydoing
nancy looks out the window and touches her hair
stand by your window so i can see you
you sound a million miles away
in the lighted window across the way she can see glen move into sight
in his shot we can see nancy step into her window behind the bars
i heard your ma went ape at the security store today
you look like the prisoner of zenda or something
how longs it been since you slept
coming up on the seventh day
its okay i checked guiness
the records eleven and ill beat that if i have to
beat listen i

yeah and if he gets me im pretty sure youre next
glen is appalled
why would anyone want to kill me
dont ask just give me some help nailing this guy when i bring him out
bring him out of what
how you plan to do that
just like i did the hat
have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up
switching back to a more comfortable reality wait a minute you cant bring someone out of a dream
if i cant then you all can relax because itll just be a simple case of me being nuts
i can save you the trouble
youre nutty as a fruitcake
i love you anyway
good then you wont mind cold cocking this guy when i bring him out
what simplicity itself you heard me
i grab him in the dream you see me struggling so you wake me up
we both come out you cold cock the fucker and we got him
hit him with what
youre a jock
you must have a baseball bat or something
come to my window at midnight
meanwhile whatever you do dont fall asleep
she hangs up
glens eyes bug out
baseball bats and boogemen
high wide shot
the moon is above the horizon
a cool wind slides a bank of white fog inland
the valley and its lights stretch forever an endless net of illumination and darkness
a coyote howls on the dark hill
a palm frond scuttles across the center of the parking lot
lt thompson arrives in an unmarked car
cop passing lieutenant thompson what you doing in at this time
cant sleep thought id come break up the poker game
the cop laughs and goes his way
thompsons smile evaporates
thompson enters and checks the log
nearby sgt garcia pours coffee
if it was any more quiet we could hear owls farting
is quiet isnt it
too casually hows your girl
thompson looks at the desk sergeant a moment then tosses down the log
shell sleep sooner or later
the neighborhood is utterly still most of the homes already dark
but not nancys
glens father watches eleven oclocks news a dreary film clip stock of war and refugees in a far away land
mr lantz takes a pull on his bud
youd think theyd have some thing bout the lane kid hanging himself
mrs lantz walks through the room drying her hands on a dishtowel
maybe were all making more out of it than we should
she heads upstairs
mr lantz pops the automatic tuner
carson blinks on
i wouldnt touch that line with a ten foot pole
ed mcmahon and the audience laugh in delight
mrs lantz comes along the upstairs hall and knocks gently at a closed door
you all right
she puts her ear to the door and listens
glen lies sprawled across the bed long legs flung over the end head not visible
his mother enters
she looks at the boy turns off the tv
looks at him again
from this angle she can see his head earphones crammed over it rasping their tinny noise
but no movement from the kid at all
mrs lantz crosses and pokes him in the ribs
glen lurches up arms windmilling
he refocuses his eyes takes off his earphones
how can you listen to carson and a record at the same time
glen swings his legs over the edge of the bed and shakes his head to clear the cobwebs
wasnt listening to the tube just watching
miss nude americas supposed to be on tonight
well how you gonna hear what she says
who cares what she says
the mother gives up
you should get to sleep soon glen
its almost midnight
goodness knows weve all had enough of a time the last few days
i will mom
in a while
you guys turning in
his mother sighs and goes out closing the door behind her
glen flips the tv back on and glances at the clock
insert of clock
tight on glens face
he clamps the earphones back on and turns
the volume up high
the music is so loud we can hear it resonating inside his skull
camera moves past glen to his window then zooms through to continue zooming into the lighted window of nancys barred second floor bedroom and close on marge weaving on the
edge of nancys bed stroking the girls hair
nancys still something of a wreck but less than marge
well go away take a vacation
get your hair colored nice the way it was
no one will ever know
sniffs this whole room smells of coffee yknow
she gathers up nancys coffee cups and empty nodoz boxes leans down and kisses her
its all over now baby
the nightmares over
nancy nods her head half stubborn half sadly
she can barely keep her eyes open now
she scrunches into her pillow
marge smiles haggardly and shuts off the light taking the coffee pot with her as she leaves
marge smiles relieved
the girl pulls the blanket around her shoulders
her eyes flutter closed her breathing becomes regular and deep
once again shes the litle girl marge fantasizes she is
the mother tiptoes out of the room closing the door behind her
hold on nancys sleeping face as the door closes
her eyes remain closed another beat then open wide
she quietly jumps out of bed and shakes herself savagely to scatter the sleep settling so quickly
still in the dark she fishes a full electric coffepot from under her bed and pours herself a fresh fix into a mug she digs from beneath her pillow
the face illuminated by the neon light on the pot is set in absolute determination
nancy drains the cup then crosses to her closet retrieves a pitcher of ice water from behind a heap of clothes and splashes her eyes and the back of her
that done she eases open her window and presses her face to the bars sucking in cool night air until every shred of sleep is gone from her brain
then she starts pulling on clothes
angle on marge as she checks the lock on the backdoor
angle in the living room as she pads through the darkened house
feels her way to a wall of shelves and takes down a book
then another and a third
then reaches in and fishes out a bottle of gin
the sky has gathered in greater darkness
low distant thunder rolls around the horizon like a great drum
angle on nancys house from across the street
the moon glints off the barred windows
camera zooms to nancys window
the imprisoned girl hovers in the darkness behind the grill like a ghost her eyes turned towards glens
then she switches to something much closer to camera angle and she draws back
reverse on glens father standing on the front porch of his
home also in the shadows looking straight across and up at nancy
he draws on his cigarette his face glows red
nancy pulls down the shade
glens father grinds the cigarette beneath his shoe
as the man turns our shot widens to reveal mrs lantz
know what i think
i think that kids some kinda lunatic
the woman spoons more sweetness into her mouth and rubs her forehead
shouldnt say such a thing about the poor child
if you mean the bars marges just being cautious her being alone and nancy acting so nervous lately
the woman rises and pulls him gently towards the living room
as he goes inside he takes one last look
well she aint gonna hang around our boy no more
once the two are inside the door is locked
close on nancys face
her eyes stare ahead red rimmed anxious
she picks absently at the thick bandage covering her forearm
the long cuts from fred kruegers fingers are bleeding again but she doesnt even care anymore
too late to sweat the small stuff
she crosses the room
on the bedside table with the nearly empty pyrex coffee maker the empty cup and the empty box of no doz is her old fashioned alarm clock and a phone
nancy pours herself the last of the coffee and drinks it to the dregs then looks to the clock
insert clock ten minutes to midnight
nancys eyes go to the door
fully clothed and in a jacket now she creeps to the door and cracks it just to make sure
in nancys pov through the door we see marge rummaging around in the linen closet not fifteen feet away
theres no way nancy can get past her
the woman pulls out a full bottle of gin in satisfaction and begins fumbling with its cap
nancy eases the door closed again and sinks to the key hole watching through it with a sinking heart
very quiet very intense hang on glen
glen coat now on goes to his window checking
glens pov nancys porch is deserted front door closed lights out
no sign of nancy
glen shrugs takes off his jacket and plops back onto his bed
well im not gonna risk sneaking out until she does
he puts the earphones back on
absolutely frustrated nancy turns from the keyhole to the window
she opens the blind and eases back the curtain
in nancys pov through the bars we zoom directly across to glens window
glen lies on his bed fully clothed earphones over his ears carson droning from the tv
and the boys eyes begin to droop
nancy picks up her phone bites her lip then begins dialing
tight on phone as it begins ringing loudly
wider shot revealing glen asleep background the music still loud in his earphones
ringing here too just as mr lantz is turning out the lights for bed
he stops in the dark scowling
who at this hour
he refuses to turn the light back on
his wife picks her way to the telephone
listens frowns slightly oh
covers the mouthpiece its her she wants to talk to glen
the father crosses to the telephone suspicious
whispering about what
into phone whats this about nancy
she listens covers up again
she says its private
very private and very important
mr lantz grabs the telephone from his wife and barks into it
talk to him tomorrow
he slams down the telephone with a grunt of satisfaction to his wife
just got to be firm with kids is all
then as a refinement he takes the phone off the hook and lays it on the table
nancy dials again
this time she gets a busy signal
she slams the phone down in frustration and looks out the window
dont fall asleep
she goes and sits on the bed propping her chin on her fists
the telephone rings
nancy snatches it up
tight on her zooming even closer on her ear and the earpiece as we hear the awful scritching scrape of steel fingerknives
nancy slaps the phone down as if it were diseased then in pure rage rips the things cord from the wall
spent instantly she puts the receiver back on the cradle and lays it on her bed chiding herself
now what if glen calls
she wraps the phone cord around the useless machine and puts it on her bed then sneaks back to the door
this time she gives an expression of relief and opens the door
marge is gone
then the telephone rings again
camera moves in on nancy as she turns slowly
reverse in her pov
the telephone rings again despite the fact
that the end of its janked out cord is clearly visible
the nightmare music theme slips right up our spines
back on nancy
she starts to shake
she goes to the telephone as we widen unwraps it as it rings even louder
shes shaking so hard by now she can barely manage to lift the receiver
move in close on her so close we can hear her teeth chattering as she brings the phone to her ear
the unmistakeable voice of fred krueger comes over the phone garbled by time and unknown dimensions but clear enough
triumphant im your boyfriend now
its changed from a normal telephone mouthpiece to an actual mouth fred kruegers mouth and his long slick tongue flicks out and darts into the startled girls mouth wider as
nancy explodes from her micro dream absolutely mad
she jerks the telephone away from her and smashes it against her wall then attacks it with her feet and hands smashing it to smithereens
angle on the telephone pieces
normal pieces of a normal telephone
she pinches herself hard until tears come and her flesh is nearly bleeding
im awake i am awake
this is not a dream
i am she stops realizing what krueger meant
nancy barrels down the stairs and across the darkened living room to the front door
it takes her a moment of tugging and fumbling to realize the deadbolt is locked from inside
and theres no key in it now
she races to a porch window and throws it open shaking and banging on the bars like a mad woman
but theres no getting through
she staggers back stymied and furious
then somebody moves behind her in the dark
nancy jumps around in shock
her mother has posted herself on the couch with her bottle
furious give me the key mother
i dont even have it on me so forget it
the word is final
nancy runs past the woman to the back door to one window after the other shaking bars and slamming locks and screaming in teenage fury
but its no good
the house is her prison
drunk satisfaction paid the guy damn good to make sure you stayed put
you aint goin nowhere kid
youre gonna sleep tonight if it kills me
nancy clenches her fists and screams at the top of her lungs a heart wrenching eardrum breaking cry of love in despair close on glens from directly above
the music is tinny from the earphones the tv sound distant and echoed
the boy is breathing deeply now slowly and gently
then unmistakeably he begins to snore
very faintly far in the background we can hear nancy
dont fall asleeeeeep
camera pulls back and straight up as the snores merge with a weird unsettling music cue
the boy lies sprawled still clothed in the middle of his bed
save for the bedside lamp the room is dark
full wide angle from this high spot looking down at him as from the eyes of some great fly hung on the ceiling
the music theres a heartbeats pause
then with tremendous force two powerful arms shoot up beneath the red and yellow bedspread and grab glen around the waist
next moment the young mans body is dragged straight down into the bed as if some huge beast had grabbed him and heaved him down
his feet and his arms shoot up theres another hauling yank and the boy disappears except for his hands and fingers down into the pit in the middle of the
his hands are last to go clawing for a hold
but soon they vanish as well dragging blankets and bedsheets wires and stereo across the caved in bed and into the abyss
theres hideous screeching of music jamming in with glens echoing screams then an unholy sudden silence
next moment whats left of glen is vomited up from the pit of the nightmare bed
a horrible mess of blood and bone and hair and wires
streaming out and over the bed
then the pit in the bed is gone as if it were never there
drawn by the terribly screams and struggle glens mother bursts into the room
the women stares for one moment of horrified disbelief then reels back and lets out the most god awful scream imaginable
the cry splits the night
the sound of the scream cross fades with the wail of the ambulance as it screeches to a halt at the curb followed by two black and whites and an
uniformed policemen spill out foreground
lt thompson and parker exit the unmarked car
by habit or by premonition thompson glances at the house that was his home
his eye is caught by a movement his daughter is at her upstairs window white haired hollow eyed looking down on him through her bars
she gives a little wave
unnerved thompson waves back then walks rapidly for glens home
mr lantz pale as a ghost himself waits on the porch we can hear the mothers wailing inside
close on nancys big old windup alarm clock
its big and little hands sweep together at midnight
theres a babble of police radios sirens winding down running foot steps shouts neighborhood kids and dogs barking as camera lifts to nancys face
the girl pulls the window shade on it all then looks at her bed
okay krueger you bastard
we play in your court
lt thompson is halfway across the living room when he stops
something dark and red is welling from a crack in the ceiling
one of his men is rigging a bucket beneah to catch the leaking
the telephone rings and parker picks it up
its your daughter
says its urgent
thompson turns away from the dripping
low tell her im not here tell her
uh she just saw you sir
thompson nods crosses and picks up the telephone
screen splits we see both
i know what happened
then you know more than i do i havent even been upstairs
guessing you know hes dead though right
thompson debates then admits it
yeah apparantly hes dead
how the helld you know
a tear coarses down nancys cheek but her voice remains firm
ive got a proposition for you

nan i please
im gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you
i just need you be right there to arrest him
just tell me who did it and ill go get him baby
fred krueger did it daddy and only i can get him
its my nightmare he comes to
the detective flinches at the name
whered you hear about krueger nancy presses very firm very rational
i want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now can you do that
thatll be exactly half past midnight
time for me to fall asleep and find him
sure sure honey
you just do that get yourself some sleep thats what ive been saying all along
and youll be here to catch him right
lieutenant theyre waiting upstairs
thompson waves curtly still speaking to nancy
sure okay ill be there
now you just turn in and get some rest sweetheart
nancy hangs up
lt thompson starts upstairs
but then he stops and as an afterthought he could never really explain turns to get outside and watch her house
if you see anything funny call me
anything funny like what
thompson shakes his head embarassed
i dont know but one thing for sure i dont want her coming over here
shes way too far gone to be able to to handle this
as parker exits angle cuts to nancys kitchen as the girl hangs up and sinks back agiainst the wall trapped by her own resolution
she looks at her watch
insert five past midnight
nancy switches modes to stopwatch
and sets the countdown going at twenty five minutes
lt thompson steps into glens room anxious to be done with it
he hits a wall of stench and horror even before he takes it in with his eyes and as soon as he sees the bed he claps his hand over
his mouth pivots and walks right back into the hallway
he sags against the wall unable to look at the cops who hover there
faint what the hell did that lieutenant
there aint even a head left
goddamed if i know
tries to straighten whats the coronor say
hes in the john puking since he saw it
nancy pulls tools and hardware out with grim resolution
hammer nails spools of wire an old square of heavy fishneting some old shot gun shells a file referring only once to the booklet in her hand
barely able to control her shaking hands nancy starts stringing off the spool of wire across the living room crying and swearing at the same time
dissolve to her hands wrapping bare lamp wire around two thumbtacks stuck into the insides of the pinchers of a common wooden clothespin
the wire goes off screen
another angle as she inserts a lifesaver between the two prongs
one end of the fishline is tied to the lifesaver
the whole now is stretched taut about three inches off the living room carpet
on nancy carefully filing a hole in a lightbulb
oh her pouring powder and shot from shotgun shells into the opening in the bulb until its full then sealing it with tape
dissolve to her screwing the bulb back into the floor lamp and placing the thing near the foot of the stairs
nancy completes installing a sturdy sliding bolt to the outside of her own bedroom door
nancy screws a hinge into the wall directly above her door
attached to the hinge is the shank of something some kind of tool
we cant see what it is because camera never quite frames the whole thing
nancy tiptoes to her mothers door and peeks in
marge lies propped in her bed looking back at nancy
her drunkeness has been altered by the sirens and babble outside into a sort of comatose clarity
guess i shouldna done it
just sleep now mom
just wanted to protect you nan
just wanted to protect you
marge slides over on her side
nancy smooths her hair covers her as she would a child then exits the room
the girl enters turns out her bedside light slips out of her dress and puts on her nightgown
then she kneels by her bed
nancy quietly now i lay me down to sleep i pray the lord my soul to keep
if i should die before i wake i pray the lord my soul to take
she gets into bed and pulls the blankets to her chin
close on nancys face
she stares straight up at the ceiling for a long moment then closes her eyes
lt thompson trudges down the stais and confronts glens father
i know its hard to think at a time like this walter but can you think of anyone who couldve done such a thing
the father stares away his voice low and dull
he done it
thompson looks at the man baffled
who did that
the father gives him the strangest look
had tove done it
no one else was in there
how you know that
cause i thought glen was gonna sneak out to see your lunatic daughter thats why
so i locked him in his room
getting control sorry
anyways the door was still locked when we heard the screams
maybe gods punishing us all
much lower and hard keep your head this is a fucking flesh and blood killer were talking about
like rod lane
a voice calls down from upstairs
coronor wants to show you something
thompson gives mr lantz one final look then heads upstairs
these rewrites of scenes and a replace nancy walking through the dream streets at night and nancy approaching the huge deserted building at night prior to her entering the boiler
room the final time
low angle up stairs as nancy appears at head
as she comes downstairs camera moves with her through the hallway to the cellar door
she opens the door
nancy appears at top of these stairs hesitates then comes down
wider as nancy approaches center of room stops in cu then turns eyes
we hear the distant sound of the boiler room now faint but unmistakeable
nancy moves and camera pans her to the cellars side wall where another new doorway is revealed
nancy opens this door and looks down
firelight is on nancys face now and the sound of the boiler room is very clear
nancy goes through the door
nancy decends like orpheus into hell but without weapon save her wits
she decends a steel stair to the lowest level then hears the sound of the knives from down another shaft
she sees theres an even deeper place down there
she starts down
again and then again nancy decends each ladder narrower or more twisting each level deeper wetter darker more airless
soon shes gasping for air but still she pushes herself on
she doesnt stop until she breaks out at last at the very bottom of the place a wet firelit sump deep in the bowels of the place
camera now pans around with her and for the first time we see the vast maul of the empty boiler behind her
she stares at it
its seething with some dark wind that soughs and whines like a huge dying dog
nancy crosses to it touching the pile of old coal dusted dirt at its base
it looks almost like an old grave
she turns suddenly listening
then hearing nothing she looks down
nancys pov as she picks up glens earphones
wider as she suddenly drops them staring at her fingers
theyre dripping blood
theres another beep
insert on nancys watch the count down a blur of black digits c
counting down to zero
theyve just crossed the ten minute warning
close on nancys face
she speaks into the night
quietly come out and show yourself you bastard
no sooner are these words off her lips than the huge bulk of fred krueger lurches up behind her
the man is even more hideous hatless his bald head and tormented face veiled in skeins of ruined flesh his ragged teeth barred the great spider of razor blades flashing
from his fingertips
he leaps but the girl leaps just as fast a fierce jump that sends her out over black space and down into a huge dark sump of blackness
close angle on nancy as she curves like a swan though her apogee and begins falling diving planing through black air the wind ripping at her hair and eyes
suddenly the complex glittering skein of light that is the san fernando valley seen from the air slides into frame and we see shes falling from high high over the
nancy falls falls in slow motion against the spinning lights free as a sky diver freefalling a giddy acrophobic plunge
nancy crashes suddenly out of the night and into a hedge just outside her own front door rolling out at its bottom scratched and bloodied
if she were in any normal reality shed be a mass of broken bones but somehow shes able to claw her way up and look at her watch once more
just a few seconds from zero
she staggers for her houses front door but a moment later krueger crashes down atop her
nancy struggles to her knees just as the man lunges with that godawful handful of blades
but instead of running she ducks inside the deadly grab and seizes him in a desperate bearhug
the surprise move sends him pitching backwards her still on him and they fall into the jumble of torn down trellis of roses beneath her window
almost at that very second we hear the jarring deafening ringing of nancys alarm clock
nancy sprawls out of her bed onto the floor twisting from the jabs of the already vanished thorns briars and brush
gasping she takes a second to get her bearings angle on the bed as she recovers quick as she can snatching up the net ready for an assault from any
but the room is empty
hardly able to catch her breath her hair tangled her nightgown torn she drops the net
she sits on the bed turns on the bedside lamp and re examines her room
no one there but herself
its a terrible blow despite the fact that shes safe
her face is covered with tears shes shaking and breathless
she rattles her head in confusion and despair realizing her own madness
im crazy after all
at that very instant fred krueger leaps up from the far side of the bed with an explosive shout of rage he lunges across the table for her missing by
inches as nancy pitches backwards and scrambles for the window
but shes stopped by the bars
krueger incredibly fast regains his feet and leaps again the girl wheels and shatters the coffeepot over his head
as he crashes backwards nancy flings open the door of her room and dives through only to rebound off someone on the other side marge knocked flying by nancys charge
hits the floor hard knocking the wind out of herself
nancy sees what shes done jumps over the body and slams the door and throws the new bolt home
next instant she gingerly ties a string to the doors knob a string that trails down from the ceiling attached to something up there thats still just barely out of
next instant shes dragging her mother towards the womans bedroom as fast as she can
krueger is already splintering the doorway behind her as nancy dips and makes it into marges room slamming the door behind her and locking it in a flash
the maniac breaks the bolt and rips open the door
but the in the very act of doing this he of course unknowingly pulls the string attached to the outside doorknob with terrific force
close angle on the ceiling
the string jerks against a single edged razor which in turn cuts a tight wind of cord holding a heavy wedge of steel to the ceiling
wider as the thing falls free pivoting at the hinge at the far end of its handle and drives straight into kruegers groin with a terrific blow
as he catapaults backwards with an incredulous shriek the twenty pound sledge hammer swings back and reveals to camera just what it is
angle down on krueger clawwing his way up despite his agony lurching and cursing forward like an enraged bull
wider angle in the hallway as krueger roars out only to immediately strike the length of wire strung across the hallway catching it just above the thigh
he cartwheels head over heels and lands flat on his back
instantly the door to nancys mothers bedroom flies open and nancy brings a brass lamp down over kruegers head with all her might
it sounds like a line drive caroming off a metal flagpole
nancy slams the door as krueger struggles up clutching his head
enraged the huge man crashes against the door with terrific force and rears back and starts smashing against the door like the utter homicidal lunatic that he is
high angle at the second floor level
nancy jerks open the window to her mothers bedroom and jams her face to the bars
the ambulance is pulling away with a tremendous wail of its siren as nancy screams down trying to make herself heard
hey daddy i got him trapped
where are you
angle on the street
parker assigned to guard the house sees
nancy hair white eyes wide pounding on the bars and screaming like a lunatic
but her meaning is utterly lost in the noise of the ambulance next to him
yelling up at her everythings going to be all right
everythings under control
angle at the window
close on nancys face incredulous at his response
get my father you asshole
parker does a little take
that almost sounded sane
you heard what i said
now get back inside or ill tell your dad
behind her the door splinters
nancy whirls around just in time
to see krueger bull in
nancys eyes go wide shes trapped against the bars and has nowhere to go
the man bunches his knives into a single thick blade and rushes her stabbing
nancy closes her eyes then from out of frame marge leaps between the two
she blocks the charge perfectly blocking the knives
both she and nancy are slammed backwards against the bars behind
drunk though she is is hanging onto kruegers weapon hand keeping the knives inside herself away from her daughter
nancy for gods sakes run
but nancy turns to the window instead screaming for her father
where are you
parker just about to turn back to the business at glens house sees nancy and someone else fall just inside the window
something begins to dawn on the man
just a little
poor womans got her hands full with that kid
maybe i better tell the lieutenant
he turns and jogs towards glens house
angle on krueger hauling marge up in rage knocking her senseless across her bed and climbing after her with his knives raised
nancy wheels behind him and whams him in the kidneys with her fists spilling him back off the bed then running past him for the door
she makes it to safety then turning back
she flips the monster the bird her eyes wild with pain and fury
hey fuckface cant catch me the bait works krueger leaves marge and howls after nancy
as nancy clears the hall and makes the stairs krueger lurches through the shattered doorway after her
the girl careens down the stairs across the room and to the front door banging against it with terrified fury
screaming come on hes in here
dont let him kill me too
behind her the huge man is thumping down the stairs knocking things over scraping his long steel fingernails along the wall with a horrible sound
nancy flings a heavy ash tray through the porch window and screams through the bars
krueger bloody and spewwing threats staggers for her nancy dives behind the couch
close on kruegers feet as they hit another wire
close on the lifesaver jerking out the clothespin snapping together completing the circuit with a crackling spark
wider on the explosion that rips out of the floor lamp next to krueger and knocks him sprawling across the room
nancy peeks out from behind the couch
the man lies in a smoking heap
nancy runs to the windows and screams out again
i got the bastard
krueger roars up behind her she throws herself sideways he crashes into the window frame smashing glass and wood to bits
nancy turns screaming and runs deeper into the house
she careens down the stairs throwing on the lights the man thundering after her
angle at the far end of the cellar
nancy brakes at the wall
nowhere left to hide
the scrapping of the blades against brick turns her to see the huge killer holding his knife laden fingers up for her
ready for these
on nancy she ducks behind the furnace comes out the other
side with the big jug of gasoline and lets krueger have it straight over the head
the heavy container shatters showering its contents over every square inch of the man
he staggers backwards with a roar of fury nancy screaming after him with a box of kitchen matches
before the man can realize what shes up to she ignites the whole box and throws it in kruegers face
theres a blinding whoosh and krueger goes up in a terrific ball of fire
faster than a flash the girl runs past the howling maniac and makes for the stairs krueger after her in full pyrrhic rage
nancy holds the heavy door until the precisely right moment
just as the burning blind monster tops the stairs nancy brings the heavy oak door round with all her might and catches him in a great ringing concussion
it sends him windmilling backwards and down the stairs in an ass over teakettle sprawl of sparks and flames
nancy slams the door and throws the deadbolt home
no sooner does she accomplish this than the man is slamming again and again against the door from the cellar
the terrible screams and curses peak then grow weaker and more garbled
then theres just silence
nancy staggers half blind from the kitchen
as the room begins seething smoke from every pore we the coroner steps out of the bathroom peeling bloody rubber gloves
pale and sweating
found you something donald
should remind you of something
the man shoves out his hand to lt thompson
thompson stares at it without touching it
a long thin steel blade razor sharp attached to some sort of ring and armature broken off
the coroner gives a sweaty grim smile
only place i ever heard of such a thing before was ten years ago
remember that fucker fred krueger
lt thompson has just knocked parker sprawling in his race to the stairs
hey your daughters acting kinda
thompsons gone strange
crash as nancy breaks another window and presses against the bars
the house shudders and glows orange behind her
she sees her father bursting out the front door of glens house
oh jesus nancy
to his men hey
we got a fire
angle on nancys front door
many men batter the door down as
black smoke pours from the windows and nancys screams and shouts fill the air
within moments theyve destroyed the door and lt thompson has pulled his daughter into the safety of his arms
but nancy immediately fights free and darts right back to the front door beckoning him to follow gesturing like a wild woman
i got him i got fred krueger
thompson stares at his wild little girl in astonishment then runs in after her
the others follow coughing and choking
thompson collides with nancy as she brakes frozen
the smoke is belching out of the cellar but whoever was locked in there certainly isnt now
the door is flat on the kitchen floor
what the hell are you talking about nancy
nancy wheels without answering
a series of tiny isolated fires burn across the living room and up the stairs
hes after mom
she darts across the living room following the flaming footprints of fred krueger up the stairs before thompson can stop her
nancy stops in the splintered doorway a ragged gold red light splashing her horrified face
reverse in her pov fred krueger literally a man of fire has
a screaming marge pinned to the bed and is crawling all over her
nancy gives a banshees howl snatches up a chair and brings it down over the back of the firey beast stunning him
by the time lt thompson races into the room nancys seized a heavy blanket has thrown over both of them fighting the flames
the father joins his daughter without a second thought heaving another blanket over the bed and smothering the last of the flames
hes under there
thompson pushes the girl back yanks out his
and pulls off
the first cover
he pulls back a second one ready to fire
but the only thing he sees is the blackened half skeleton of his ex wife smoking and seething and sinking into the fluid like mattress sinking right down through it
as if she were sinking into a lake
a blackened gnarled hand goes last then the bed solidifies over the place shes disappeared
and its as if no one was ever there
nancy turns and looks at lt thompson her face white as her ghostly hair
thompson shoves his
back in its holster and finds a cigarette his hands shaking so badly he can barely manage
now do you believe me
parker barges in
the room is filled with smoke the bed is stripped but other than that the place seems normal
you find him
looking closer at thompson sir
lt thompson just walks by him
parker chases after
fading sir here let me light that for you lieutenant
gone wider on nancy alone in the room
she turns and looks at the bed
music slips in and builds
the bed has changed color its now an ash darkened red and yellow
closer on nancy from the direction of the bed
stops and the surface of the red and yellow bed gets a bump in its center that keeps raising raising until its a hump thats a head and shoulders still
raising until it looms over nancy
then fred kruegers entire shape sweeps up into the yellow and red mass and the garish head smoking and seething pops through
new angle krueger a burned sizzling black hump of a killer clumps onto the floor between nancy and the door
nancy falls absoltely still and her face goes through a strange almost sublime transformation
quietly i know youre there krueger
she turns and faces him
you think you was gonna get away from me
nancy shakes her head
i know you too well now freddie
krueger smiles bitterly
and now you die
theres a slickering rattle at his side and he raises the only thing on him not charred the gleaming steel talons
nancy simply shakes her head again as if seeing a light at the
end of her long long tunnel
and the way she says the words they might be appearing on the inside of her eyes
its too late krueger
i know the secret now this is just a dream too youre not alive the whole thing is a dream so fuck off
i want my mother and friends again
krueger grins insanely confused and amused at the same time
you what even firm i take back every bit of energy i ever gave you
and then she turns her back on him
krueger bunches his fingers producing a single ragged bundle of razor talons and raises his hand over the back of her head and neck
nancy closes her eyes and steps to the door
close on her hand touching the door knob
close on kruegers knife fingers poised
music builds then shrieks as krueger stabs down right through as if she were an optical illusion loosing his balance and falling down down down
and hes gone
close on nancys front door as nancy jerks it open and blinks in the bright diffused light
the music fades on a transitional note into light
we hear birds
early morning sounds
to herself god its bright
marge sticks her head out squinting and nods
gonna burn off soon or it wouldnt be so bright
nancy turns and looks her mother over
they say youve bottomed out when you cant remember the night before
shakes her head no more drinking baby suddenly i just dont feel like it any more
she touches nancy
didnt keep you up last night did i
you look a little peeked
just slept heavy
the girl gives a wave and goes off
marge calls after
nancy turns and waves
wider on nancy as she walks to the curb
the whole scene is
wrapped in an unseasonal tule fog bright yet diffuse
we notice that nancys house no longer has bars on its windows
then we see a familiar convertible pull up at the curb top down
tina and rod are in the back seat
they all wave to marge as nancy climbs in
calling you believe this fog
laughs i believe anythings possible
tina slaps five with nancy
lookin good girl
angle inside the convertible
glen slips into the seat next to nancy
someone else is driving it seems
nancy looks up to the driver
the big man turns and grins at nancy a terrible scarred hideous leer of a grin fred kruegers grin
angle back outside the convertible as its top clamps over the kids within a bright red and yellow top that closes as fast and hard as a beartrap
nancys frightened face flies to the window pressing against the thick glass as the car roars away from the curb and into the thick fog
camera pans to a group of little girls half hidden by the fog
jumping rope and singing gayly
one two freddys coming for you
three four better lock your door
five six get your crucifix seven eight gonna stay up late
nine ten never sleep again
