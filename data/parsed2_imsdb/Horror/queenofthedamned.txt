written by scott abbott and michael petroni based on the novel by anne rice an empty breeze blows across a deserted cemetery
we hear the sound of footsteps approaching then nineteenth century boots enter frame
we follow them strolling past the headstones and mausoleums
the sound of a horse and carriage echoes in the distance
there comes a time for every vampire when the idea of eternity becomes momentarily unbearable
as we reach an old stone tomb the boots leap up and out of frame
pan up to reveal a figure stands steadily atop the roof of the tomb silhouetted against the moon like a large black bird
the wounds suffered from love and failed friendships dont heal like a humans but seem to only gape larger
the longing to be mortal returns a longing for finiteness
a beat as the indistinct figure gazes out at the night
the figure enters an alabaster tomb and closes the door
in i suffered such a spell and decided to cease feeding on blood
just lie in the earth and let time return to its natural state
as the wind picks up the leaves of a fledgling vine growing up the side of the tomb begin to rattle faster and faster until curiously time seems to speed
night passes to day and back to night
shadows from the sun and moon drift across the tomb
as days and months fly by the vine winds and grows in circuitous patterns all around the tomb
i had hoped the sounds of the passing eras would fade out and a kind of death might happen
a kind of forgetting where i would be healed from my wounds
the clip clop of horses and the squeak of perambulators dissolve into the thump and scrape of industrial engines
but as i lay there the sounds didnt fade but grew with the world
the buzz of prop engines melt into the sound of a jet streaming overhead
cars machines radio broadcasts merge into a medley of music from this century jack and gradually the world didnt sound like the place i had left but something different
as we draw closer to the now vine covered tomb sounds of the s s s persist
a new fearless attitude had possessed the world brave and godless
i began to wonder if it was not time to resurrect
but the thing that eventually brought me back the decisive thing really came like a bolt out of the blue
guitars strike drums crack and the music slams out raw and dark
slender hands with long painted nails gothic rings and a half pound of silver bracelets play their instruments
long hair body piercings celtic tattoos and brightly colored nylons show a lot of pale smooth flesh
in the confusion of glimpses its hard to tell whos a boy or girl but theyre all young and beautiful
breaking in on the cacophony of music comes one guitar closer and louder than the rest
a scraping roar like a bandsaw being twisted into the most gorgeous powerful chords almost religious in its emotion
a music so sublime so deeply vampiric i had no doubt it could be heard in hades
i had no choice
it summoned me
an ultra fast techno beat begins and the full sound of a band rushes in creating a sense of vertigo with its energy
the bands sounds echo about the stone chamber thrumming a deep life giving pulse
suddenly the lid of a sarcophagus scrapes and slides to one side
the figure re emerges from the tomb his cape now in tatters posture bent
he creeps across the cemetery in unnatural staccato movements as if hindered by the physics of distance and time
all the while the song plays drawing the figure toward it
the figure moves through the shadows avoiding the spill of yellow light from the street lamps
stopping in a darkened alleyway he gasps for air exhausted by his movements
he listens again to the mesmeric tune of the band in the distance when from down the alley a voice
in french subtitled need a fix
staring hungrily at
a man proffering a little parcel wrapped in foil
pulling deeper into the shadows the caped figure beckons the dealer over
the man approaches when with a wild animal cry the figure lunges like a phantom a flash of teeth the dealer is on the ground the figure set upon him
over this scene the bands song rushes in loud again reaching an incredible crescendo as the violent frenzy continues the monster gnawing at the dealers neck
its vein refilling with the flow of warm blood skin regaining a youthful tautness
rising from his victim we see for the first time the revitalized face of this creature a mane of blond hair frames the beautiful features of the vampire lestat his
bulbous lips glistening red
whether it was that first meal the music or the years of rest im not sure but suddenly i was feeling better than ever
my appetite for living was voracious
my hearing so exact i could locate precisely the source of the music
in the street lestat emerges from the shadows in the dealers snug fitting leather outfit
he looks up at an extremely run down flophouse
my old house
high in the attic a single window glows with dim light
the source of the music
the whole house is shaking from the sound of the band playing upstairs
the room booms with music speakers stacked high on all sides literally shaking the house to its foundations
reveal the band members of satans night out
james alex and maudy stare at each other as if in some tantric trance as they play their music alexs long fingers climbing up and down his guitar maudys waifish
body sensually curls around her keyboard the waves of music flowing through them while james on drums drives them further into it
it was hard to believe these beings were mortal so confident in their skin
everything in my body wanted to be with them
i couldnt help myself
then from somewhere in the room an angelic voice begins to hum the most hypnotic melody over the tune melding in exquisite harmony
arching her neck in some higher ecstasy maudy looks across the makeshift studio and suddenly stops playing
what the hell maudy
seeing maudys stunned face alex and james turn to see lestat perched like a raven on top of the stack of speakers eyes closed still humming to the fading reverb
of the guitars
slowly opening his cool grey eyes please dont stop
what the f how did you get in here
the door of course
james and alex look at the door on the other side of the attic they should have seen him
maudy stares at lestat quite taken by the handsome vampires looks drinking maudy in with his eyes your music woke me from the longest sleep
in two hundred years ive never heard anything quite like it
who the hell are you
the question provoked an irresistible urge
you may call me the vampire lestat
as we remain on the stunned looks of the bands faces it just rolled out of my mouth
with one simple sentence i had betrayed everything about my kind
betrayed our code of secrecy
your struggles are over
suddenly from across the room all that youve ever dreamed of will be yours
they spin around to see lestat now right behind them smiling
terrified what the hell is this
your lucky day
they all stare at him faces white
then james breaks into a big smile
we got our very own vampire
maudy and alex look at each other getting used to it
they break into smiles going with it
hey vampire lestat ive always wondered
about keith richards
flying across night skies as the distinctive dark sound of satans night out kicks in to join lestats soaring voice
it was a bold move i admit
but from that moment on they were my friends my children my band
together we rode on the wave of my preternatural ambition to superstardom giving the world a new god
we come across the city lights of london
below police cars section off a few blocks around a very sleek ultramodern office building where a huge crowd has gathered
through the crowd a very long black limousine snakes its way toward the building
rows of fans dressed as goths ghouls and vampires scream out
girls press their breasts and necks up against the limousine
fan after female fan flings herself on the car
groupies scream with pure excitement
confusion of screams as the door to the limo opens
the crowds scream reaches a fever pitch as
james alex and maudy climb out ogle at the sight
roger smythe their business manager s gets out next hustling them through the crowd
a wave of hysteria hits the fans
roger hustles the band through the crowd and up the stairs into the church past the giant billboard with their own images written huge lestats smiling face above them all
and the announcement a high tech conference room
the band sitting up front is faced by an audience of over fifty journalists and then another fifty photographers and tv cameras
the room crackles with anticipation
roger steps to the podium
may i present the vampire lestat
he pushes a button and a black curtain slides open to reveal a huge monitor on the wall
every eye is glued to the screen
then suddenly on the screen a face in shadow appears
his voice booms out over the crowd
im so sorry im late
i was just having my
then lestat leans forward into the light
hushed whispers move through the crowd
lestats eyes burn unnaturally bright
his white skin absolutely glows luminous
lestat smiles out at them with a tight smile
then grins wider revealing his fangs
excellent makeup job
marilyn manson look out
a thousand questions suddenly burst out of the journalists
were gonna keep this short here
one at a time
he points to a pretty french journalist
you say youre a real vampire
correct me if im wrong but what i remember about vampires is you guys usually keep your identity secret
but why hide it in this day and age
ive hidden in the shadows for centuries
its time to share myself with the world
in the corner roger gives a big winking smile to the camera crew
the journalists smile playing along
a younger hipper music magazine journalist pipes in
and it doesnt hurt the record sales huh
your album just topped all kinds of sales records
our label isnt complaining no
could you prove it
you know give us a demonstration of your powers
if you like ill give you a private demonstration in your hotel room tonight
the journalists laugh
the french journalist looks a little frightened fascinated by lestats leer
why not a demo at your own house
i mean whats with all the secrecy about where you stay
is it true you move residences every few days
smiles giving away nothing after calling one stone tomb home sweet home for so long i like to experience as much diversity as i can
the lifestyle journalist smiles
there are a lot of rumors flying around the internet about the hidden meaning in your lyrics that youre giving away vampire secrets
something in all that
in a dark room the interview continues
maybe im trying to resurrect a few old friends with my words
daring them to come out
of the closet
smiles the casket
theyre enjoying this performance although no one is taking it very seriously
pull out to reveal we are a man in a dark suit plays pool
looking up over his dark glasses his strange luminescent grey eyes stare up at lestat on the tv scornfully
your first and only concerts in death valley just days away
why just the one
grins i dont like repeating myself
but these other vampires arent they going to be pissed that youre giving away their secrets
i imagine they are yes
do you have anything to say to the other vampires listening out there
yes as a matter of fact i do
leaning forward lestat smiles at the tv camera
come out come out wherever you are
camera booms down to reveal
a group of dangerous looking vampires dressed in various styles staring stony faced up at the screen their eyes glowing strangely in the ultra violet light
the pool player is in the b
other vampires dressed in black eyes cold as ice stare up at the tv
goddamn fools going to bring back the inquisition
i say we kill him before this gets out of hand
bleed him dry
gotta find him first
never know where hes going to turn up
well we know one place hes definitely going to be
next to him sits a female vampire evian bottle in hand
when i was in manchester the coven there was saying exactly the same thing
that we should nail him at the concert
i dont know if hes as old as they say hes gotta be pretty strong
if you came within a mile of him hed eat you alive
she brings her evian bottle to her lips
the liquid inside glistens deep red
well lets see how he handles a thousand of us at once
crack the pool player sinks the last ball on the pool table
the tv suddenly explodes
he smiles at the journalists
see you all in death valley
the screen goes black
in the flesh
reveal he is
all alone in his magnificent chateau
he sits in front of a video camera and monitor set up for the two way remote feed
lestat puts the remote down
laughs out loud with the pure pleasure of it all
he stands crosses to huge doors
goes out to
lestat walks across his lavish grounds gazes up into the night
staring up at the dark heavens lestat inhales like an emperor taking in his kingdom stretches his arms out still drinking in the adulation
slowly his grin fades
a melancholy look comes over lestat
quietly to world come out come out whoever you are
as he lowers his arms the camera pulls up and out from lestat whirling into the dark night
as it plays lestats song
a beautiful young woman jesse lays in black satin sheets
her long red hair snakes over her slender neck as she sleeps to lestats voice still as death
flickering candles all over the room reveal her lithe strong body pale as the moon
she is surrounded by her work ancient language books her laptop computer
another book is clenched in her hand
the unconscious vampire
we move in on her fluttering eyes
pull back to reveal these eyes belong to a th century porcelain doll
we track across rows and rows of dolls from different eras all exquisitely detailed
track past the billowing floor to ceiling curtains to reveal a six year old girl lying awake in a large bed jesse green eyes and long red curls
laughter wafts in with the breeze
jesses bare feet pad down the endless corridor
the little girl is dwarfed by the stone pedestals all lit with candles
laughter echoes through the halls
jesse moves past rough hewn columns watching something with great curiosity
behind her we glimpse a giant mural of names cut into the stone walls
a family tree extending up onto the ceiling and down to the floor
a grand party is in progress
there are about thirty vampires all thin pale and beautiful
an eclectic group elegantly dressed in indian silks arabic veils mixed with a few gaudy versace outfits
guests lean into each others necks showing blood red tongues and fangs
a young vampire scoops jesse up and puts her on his knee
you want to come and play with us dont you
she stares at him nervous intrigued
soon soon little one
ill make sure youre with us forever
more urgent jesse
jesse sits up with a start
she stands heart pounding trying to shake the dream off
we see on a bulletin board behind her a flyer for lestats concert
she takes off the headphones
walking over to the mantel above her fireplace she picks up a solitary framed photo holds it tight
young jesse the girl from the dream stares straight at camera
she is held in the arms of a red haired woman her back to camera
jesse puts the photo down catches her reflection in a mirror lit by flickering candlelight
her face is distressed troubled by the dream
she goes to the window stares out into the black night
the dark waters of the thames snake through the london cityscape
jesse blows out the candles
fluorescence pierces the black night
jesse comes out of the tube station in a tight short skirt boots
she looks down the street
in one direction a busy brightly lit street
jesse gazes at a group of tourists coming out of a pub laughing
then she turns looks the other direction
a dark street
she hesitates a long moment stares at the light then cant help herself plunges toward the darkness the laughter echoing then jesse passes rent boys stepping from the shadows as
cars cruise by
jesse unable to look away gazes as one gets in a car
he stares back at her disappears into the car
jesse passes couples using the shadows for privacy in the dark filthy streets
she strides past a girl leaning against a brick wall the man grunting moving rhythmically against her
fog floats in the yellow vapor lights
jesse pauses at the intersection of a narrow alley
she hesitates nervous then turns down the dark lane disappearing into the blackness
jesse from the shadows gazes wide eyed at the soho private clubs entrance a solitary door with a faded sign and a dull blue light mounted above
jesse hears strange whispering
she sees now figures moving through the fog
one pushes a buzzer
jesse stares barely breathing her heart pounding
the figures have white luminescent faces strange bright glowing eyes
their fingernails are glass like
a moment later a slot in the door opens
the glowing eyes of another creature stares out at them scrutinizing them
the door closes quickly
jesse stands there deliberating
she takes a step closer to the door
takes another nervous step
she hears something whirls around
another group of the strange figures walk steadily down the street towards her
jesse begins backing away
a hissing sound slowly fills the alley
smiling revealing his fangs
reveal we are
lestats face appears on a video screen in front of a room lined from floor to ceiling with leather bound books ancient scrolls
subjects are marked werewolves poltergeists possession
jesse making a presentation stands before an impressive and imposing group of talamascans wearing demure suits
jesse is excited a bit nervous hoping to impress
she holds a remote which controls images appearing on the large video screen
clips from lestats press conference continue
jesse gazes out at the talamascans
i have reason to believe lestats the real thing
and an ancient one
i dont know jesse
it looks to me like the guys got a good p
man with a flair for the theatrical
leans forward eagerly it would appear that way
but have you listened to his songs
read his lyrics
the talamascans glance at each other surprised
shake their heads
a few laugh
theyre not lestats usual audience
well i have
in one of his songs he refers to a pub called the sailors arms
i think its a clue
she pushes a button the lyrics appear on screen
reading screen where are you now
back in the sailors arms somewhere in the back streets of soho
i tracked down the old leases in london
it turns out in the late s there was a pub right in the backstreets of soho called the sailors arms
the lyrics on screen are replaced now by an old engraving of a pub with the sign reading sailors arms
and it had a reputation for dealing with black magic
witches covens seances that sort of thing
quick flashes of gruesome drawings appear animal sacrifices
a corpses floating above a table
jesse talks faster and faster with her enthusiasm
and most importantly reports of people being lured there and subsequently attacked by bloodsucking fiends
quick flashes of gruesome period newspaper drawings blood pouring from the neck of a screaming woman
a white faced ghoul with fangs
jesse is smiling wider excited by her discovery
on screen an old map of london appears
heres where you could find the sailors arms in old london
a modern map appears overlaying the old map
and here is where it would be today
of course the sailors arms is not there anymore
that part of london is mostly old warehouses meat packing plants
in a few years it will be artists lofts and pretentious french cafes
jesse leans forward now as she talks
yes but right now theres only one place to get a drink of sorts
a private club in exactly the same place
the waverly arms
on screen a photo of the waverly arms
well what happens at the waverly arms now makes the sailors arms look like a happy meal at mcdonalds
she pauses for emphasis gazing at the faces of the talamascans gauging their reactions
its a vampire coven
and lestats leading us to it
many of definite interest
some of definite skepticism
jesses face shines bright with her enthusiasm
skeptical and what makes you think so
pushes a button
ready to receive the talamascans approval
on screen a new picture appears of several figures white faces dark clothes but theyre very blurry
jesse can you uh focus that any better
excitement dampened by embarrassment well
it was taken
clears throat in motion
talamascan smiles at her sympathetically
jesse gazes out at the other talamascans sees shes losing their interest
quickly trying to cover but listen if you look closely you can see theyre vampires
im sure of it
and lestats leading us to them and interrupting interesting
perhaps we should assign someone to observe oh please based on this so called data
thats a waste of time
looking up for a moment interrupting wait a second
who took this picture
a beat softly i did
murmurs bubble through the entire group now
they stare at jesse dismayed
you went there
and who gave you this directive
quickly look i know it was breaking protocol and im really sorry its just i think jesse
youre just an apprentice here
you must follow our rules
or perhaps we need to reconsider your position
she stares at him
for centuries our mission as talamascans has been to observe and record paranormal behavior
but never get involved
youre getting far too close
gesturing to photo defending herself hey does it look like i got involved
that is not called involvement
that is called running
leaning forward trying to help but jesse tell us what did you see
jesse turns to her
im sure of it
jesse steps from the podium moving through the talamascans as she pleads her case
she talks a mile a minute her passion rising
you have to listen to lestats lyrics
many of the references could only be derived from years of research in the bibliotech de paris which seems unlikely for a young rock star in his early twenties
plus there are historical details dating back hundreds of years lestat describes that dont exist anywhere
except in our library
he refers to marius the great white lord who ruled over a group of islands off the bay of naples in the late th century
what im trying to say here and maybe im not doing the best job of it is that lestat may be the oldest and most powerful vampire ever documented
jesse sees some of the talamascans are again listening
but talamascan shakes his head
it doesnt make any sense
why would he be forecasting this to the world
hes all but drawn a map and marked an x
what vampires hold sacred is keeping their kind a secret
you never name other immortals tell where their lairs are
theyd be hunted down
thats the best part
lestats not afraid to piss them off
he wants mortals and immortals to know hes there to know he exists
i dont know why
glancing at skeptical talamascan but this has never happened before
dont you see
hes a one man revolution
all the talamascans gaze at her a moment
jesse holds her breath
has she gotten them back
and this photo is your evidence
its hardly conclusive
it looks like the blair witch
the talamascans burst out laughing even talamascan
jesse gazes at them her face burning red
shes lost them blown it
made a fool of herself
her frustration rises she can no longer contain it
it bursts out of her
well then i guess ill just have to go back and get better more conclusive evidence
maybe you just cant unravel all the mysteries of the world out there by sitting around all day in a dusty old library in here
as they gaze at her astonished she gathers her materials starts out
several start shouting back at her
amidst the uproar a voice booms across the room
david talbot stands in the back of the room
hes clearly the superior talamascan though younger than some very charismatic
he turns walks out
all the talamascans look at jesse
it doesnt look good
her face burning red jesse turns leaves
a line of hopefuls wanting to enter the exclusive club wait for the judgement of two bouncers one buff one
okay you in
smiles at a sexy girl you in
to unattractive guy you no
cmon man shes waiting for me in there
she said she was putting me on the list
my names norman yeah yeah right
hey get a life alright
to another sexy girl you in
across the street a figure in the shadows watches
bouncer is now making out with one of the young sexy girls he let in trying to get a hand up her dress
a cold wind suddenly blows fluttering her skirt
he looks up
a dark figure stands in the shadows
hey perv get the hell out of here
the figure steps from the shadows
the bouncers face turns white
the bouncer starts to back way
the girl starts to scream
lestat clamps his hand over the girls mouth
to the girl
he gestures to the club
the girl turns and runs for her life
as the bouncer backs away terrified lestat turns to him
lestat lunges like a phantom a flash of teeth as they fall from frame the distinct sound of bone crushing
over this scene the bands song rushes in
dabs his mouth politely with a white handkerchief the sound of the band practicing from below
lestat and his band rehearse one of their numbers music and voice melding into a grand almost operatic harmony
two sound engineers work the board
whens the concert
these guys are gonna kill
behind them roger sits pensively watching
surreptitiously he glances down at a book on his lap its title vampires the occult truth
he talks on a phone
well need a limo from the airport
i dont know which airfield yet
i dont know the arrival time either
ill call you from the plane
nope ill tell the driver where hes taking us
hey i dont even know myself
pick up address in london
youd never find this place
christ well probably have changed houses again by then
what can i say the guys just
shaking his head phil glances down at his vampire book
looking back up he see lestat now staring at him intensely while he sings
softly just uh
lestat slides into a high c leaning into the microphone catching his own reflection in the booths window and roger jumps out of his skin stifling a cry
james alex and maudy whoop with excitement
yes id say im down with that
they all laugh
im ready for los angeles
im ready for death valley
jazzed two days till we go
through the broken glass we see roger slump into a chair his nerves totally frayed
think we can call that a night
unhooking their instruments alex and james start to pack up as maudy slowly approaches lestat and nuzzles his neck
he shivers with temptation
her hand moves down the front of his pants
lestat pulls her into his arms
leaning into her neck he breathes in her scent closes his eyes and
suddenly opens them right at roger who looks on extremely perturbed
smiling like the devil
oh the sweet song of her blood
roger stares on terrified
ill hear it in my head all night
gently letting maudy go
he goes directly to roger reaches into his open shirt pulls out the crucifix around his neck
i didnt know you were religious
roger tries to laugh it off
lestat sniffs the air
as roger backs away he turns to open the door stumbles cutting his hand on a fallen shard of glass
blood trickles from the cut
roger looks up at lestat whose dark eyes stare intensely at rogers blood
roger quickly sticks his hand in his mouth
with a horrified expression he realizes hes sucking his blood
he quickly heads out
but lestat is faster and reaches into rogers shirt pocket
pulls out a clove of garlic
lestat shakes his head with a smile
roger tries to laugh
reaches for the garlic to put it back in his pocket
but lestat grabs rogers hand blood trickling down his wrist
lestat speaks intensely
be careful roger
lestat walks away
roger exhales with relief
a wood lined room walls covered with books artifacts paintings
jesse stands before talbot
he fixes his eyes on her pours her some coffee
you sleeping okay
yeah im great
i just found a vampire
considers her jesse
youre taking this lestat stuff pretty seriously
cause i think im on to something pretty big
the most important sighting talamascas had in years
beat sighs jesus i dont know david
i thought i was onto something
maybe i didnt see anything
talbot takes in the dark circles around her eyes how quickly shes emptied her coffee cup
he pours her more smiles gently
you know we work in a really strange field
the supernatural is beguiling at times
it doesnt like to just be observed it is only satisfied when it has drawn us in completely
i know cause ive felt these things myself
thats what we have to resist as talamascans
as a shadow crosses his face its not always easy
leaning forward talbot
you know me
im not freaking out on you
im just onto what looks alright looked like a good lead
youre the one who taught me how to do all this
youre the one who taught me to keep pushing and pushing
he still looks at her with a penetrating glance
she looks back at him
theres nothing else
nothing is beguiling me alright
he gazes at her as she downs her whole coffee registering her strong denial
he smiles at her forcefully changes the mood
jesse starts out
looking down at papers on his desk talbot calls out almost casually
well all i can say is youre really lucky youre not lying dead in a gutter with two holes on your neck
id be even luckier if that damn picture came out
stops in her tracks turns back gazes at him amazed wait a second
so you do believe me
you do think its a vampire coven
looks up eyes sparkling yes
but not exactly for the reasons you think
though your research is top notch of course
smiles come back here
im gonna show you something
he goes to the paintings hanging on a wall in the back of his office covered with black velvet
he unveils them
they stand before an eighteenth century painting
the interior of an enormous italian villa
theres a man in his forties with long white hair back to us but his face is reflected in a standing mirror
what do you see
theyre all nightscapes
the detail is amazing
and what do you see in this one
jesse moves to the next painting
another nightscape a giant medieval tableaux circa bruegel
and i know its a dutch pastoral
jesse runs her finger across the faces then stops on the face of a gentleman with long white hair watching the bloodshed of gory battles and the sacrifices of saints
burned at the stake
this man is in both
hes in all of them
jesse moves to the next painting then the next and the next all nightscapes set and painted in the style of different eras all featuring a portrait of the same
white maned man
have you carbon tested
the different paint samples are all authentic
all painted at the time of that particular style
jesse stops at a contemporary self portrait
its marius jesse
whirling around marius
from lestats lyrics
i knew i was right
yes you were
she smiles at him victorious
ive been personally tracing him for decades
my little obsession
the oldest vampire ever documented
the closest weve come to the original vampire
what do you mean the original vampire
pointing to a larger depiction of a beautiful woman in egyptian garb theres a mesopotamian legend that there once was a queen of egypt akasha long before tutankhamen or nefertiti
she was believed to be the original vampire
marius himself dates back to b
jesse gazes at all the paintings shaking her head in wonder then speaks softly
david youve been tracking marius your whole life
maybe hes out there waiting for you right now
without looking at him dont you ever want to just go and find him and talbot crosses to her
jesus we are not talking about having a drink at the dorchester jesse
you know that
especially with the ancient vampires the older they are the more powerful the more dangerous
he takes her by the arm smiles down at her
anyway you dont need to go and stake out some club
your time is too valuable
i have something far better for you
surprised you do
he steers her over to a locked cabinet
and ill tell you something
ive never shown this to anyone
no one else has proved themself in the way you have
what is it
as he unlocks the cabinet
oh youre gonna love this
glancing at her although im sure it will keep you up nights to come with nightmares
he takes out an old leather bound journal
turns to jesse
i found it some years ago
this is where youll find the answers you need
jesse stares up at him in absolute awe taking it in
talbot gestures in the direction of the talamascans in the library
they dont need to know everything right
she smiles at him
he gives her the diary
thank you for this
when i took you on as an apprentice i knew it was the smartest thing id ever done
now you and ill meet when youre done
this will be our project
as jesse goes out holding the journal talbot smiles after her
but after the door closes his gaze turns again to concern
he crosses back to the paintings pauses a moment staring up into mariuss eyes
then talbot covers each with the black velvet
jesse sits on the floor curtains drawn the room lit with candles
a lestat song plays in the b
she opens the journal
je suis le vampire lestat
a beat i am the vampire lestat
a solitary paradise in a rough nighttime sea
it was the winter of and i was brought to a mediterranean island by the man who made me
a lightning flash illuminates a sprawling th century sea front villa
if a man is what youd call him
a great round room encircled with candles their reflections flickering in the great glass windows braving back the outside storm
a huge antique bed sits in the rooms center and on it
lestat lays feverish and fitful dressed in a soft linen nightshirt
his neck wears a swollen bite
another flash of lightning suddenly jolts him awake
his hands feel the inflamed wound as he sees
an indistinct shape of a man dressed in draping red velvet sitting asleep in a chair across the room
an easel stands before him holding an unseen painting
lestat rises out of the bed and grabs his clothes from a nearby louis iv chair
he makes for a door when
lestat suddenly stops
he looks back to see the painting that stands on the easel
its a portrait of himself in ancient roman garb like the god mars complete with his blond hair and fiery blue eyes
unable to help himself he approaches the painting completely fascinated by his own image when suddenly
the sleeping man leaps up grabs lestat unmercifully and again plunges his teeth into the young mans neck
lestat fights as best he can but his strength is no match as hes slowly drawn down to the floor
the strange man lifts himself up from lestats neck to reveal the face of the vampire marius the mysterious figure
wiping his blooded mouth on his painters cloth lestat
weakened and helpless lestat drags himself back across the floor in terror
who are you
do i know you
im unknowable by nature
marius advances again on the young man
but you may call me marius
as lestat keeps weakly dragging himself away
im the lord of a great manor
theyll send an army of men to look for me
i doubt theyll find you lord de lioncourt
youre a long way from home
his strength leaving him lestat slumps flat on the floor
i can barely hear your heartbeat
ill kill you
marius smiles impressed
you really do fear nothing
it is why i chose you
because you think things are possible which arent possible
lestat stares at him his eyes wide
someone to share my burden
bending down he gazes at lestat
youve lost a great deal of blood
near tears im dying
suddenly marius draws a knife from a roman sheath on his belt
with the last of his strength lestat grabs his attackers wrist
guiding lestats hand with the knife marius smiles and cuts his own arm opening his veins
lestat stares in true terror as marius lets his blood drip onto lestats lip
lestat pulls away as the blood slides into his mouth
good is it not
it does taste good
thats the new terror thats gripping him
he crosses himself and stares up into mariuss gentle eyes
marius bends down cups lestats chin
drink and live
youve been brave enough for one night my son
marius brings his open vein to lestats lips
lestat hesitates but then suddenly
feeds hungrily as mariuss face fills with the bond
he slowly sinks down to his knees as lestat feeds and feeds
as lestat drinks a barrage of images flood into him
of mariuss life through the ages
impressionistic subliminal burst of images color
the glory days of the roman empire to this very moment flash by
he keeps drinking from the vampire marius who gasps with the creation of his child
drink and learn
lestats body grows stronger his back arching up as he draws the life into him with full force as
marius begins to weaken himself
that will do
but lestat keeps on feeding hungrily
lestat no more
with one great move marius pulls lestat off his arm and tosses him across the floor twenty feet away
marius reels back clamping his open vein with his hand as lestat curls on the ground gasping ecstatically from the rush
slowly lestat starts to feel something
pain begins travelling through his body consuming him until he screams
marius crosses to lestat convulsing on the floor
he kneels and gently wipes his brow
lestats body thrashes as he grabs at his own limbs
dont be afraid its only your body that dies
wiping his brow as he dies
then lestats face still buried in his arms he begins to laugh almost drunkenly
raising his head his metamorphosis is clear as his face pales and his eyes fill with a new kind of power
lestat smiles with red glistening lips
a beat on marius as he slowly smiles too
a million stars
i impressed my maker with my thirst for things
he set out to educate me in the unknown
taught me all about the world its hidden history
and about myself
tilt down to reveal an old fisherman who cries out as lestat bites into his throat
marius watches as the fishermans body relaxes
he pulls lestat away
thats enough my son
when you feed you must hold back from the moment of death
you must never take the last drop or it will draw you in and you will die
the fisherman is moaning
looking down at the suffering victim marius swiftly snaps his neck and dumps him into a boat
he picks up an oar and with vampire strength drives it like a stake through the bottom of the boat
water starts bubbling in
remember there is wisdom in the flesh lestat
a man wears his history on his skin
marius feels lestats gaze turns to him
im talking about humanity
as lestat watches the water begin to fill the bottom of the boat
snort were murderers
were more than that
their blood that we take into us carries with it life
their life their knowledge their complexity
appreciate your prey lestat
marius gazes at the fisherman then with vampire strength shoves the boat far out into the ocean
below the brightest of summer night skies lestat and marius walk along talking intensely
the ocean appears to shimmer in the faint light of stars
in the distance several bonfires burn on the sand dancing figures gathered around
my senses run amok like a newborn child
and as for my new powers i was beside myself with the pleasure of it all
the trick is to find the way to face eternity head on
the spirit can be annihilated by boredom just as the body can be destroyed by sun or fire
my solace my delight is witnessing the unfolding of human destiny
lestat gazes at mariuss eyes dancing with intellectual fervor
as they walk they pass a group of teenagers just younger than lestat at a bonfire dancing laughing
lestat gazes over at them as he and marius pass hidden in shadow
from christ to the dark ages to the enlightenment ive never been able to divine what was coming
thats what keeps me going i cant wait to see what human beings are going to do next
lestat nods taking it in
they pass another bonfire
music floats through the night
an older man plays balalaika while his daughter plays violin with great passion
who couldve predicted the enlightenment
or hannibal and his elephants
marius stops talking turns
lestat is no longer beside him
marius turns back and sees lestat standing in the shadows listening to the music
the young woman sensing something turns towards lestat in the shadows as she plays
marius goes to lestat pulls him farther into the shadows
but why must we hide marius
we are the powerful we are the immortal
we should walk fearless in the open
the life of a vampire is a life of discretion
we must sleep during the day when we are vulnerable to the sun
mortals must never know about us
it is forbidden for the sake of all our kind
gazing at violin player as it sinks in so i could never know her
not unless you wanted to kill her
beat quietly intensely so i can never be known
youre known by me
i granted you that
there are others of our kind
though most are solitary creatures
lestats eyes fill with some existential realization
youre no longer in his realm
now we must leave
relenting lestat starts to follow
but the music quickens
lestat pauses turns back
as if the music is calling to him
the girl still faces into the shadows towards him and plays fast and wild her fingers flying
lestat stands there frozen to the spot
the music pulses through him
he gazes at her fingers studying their intricate movements intensely
impulsively lestat goes back to them hovers his face still somewhat obscured by the darkness
lestat starts clapping along to the music exuberantly
the girl and father smile nod to him as they play
marius in the shadows is fuming
lestats eyes fill with the moment the girls vitality
he notices that sitting on the ground by the girl are several instruments
impulsively he reaches over picks up a violin
he studies the girls playing again then with his new powers as if by osmosis
begins to play with exactly her skill exactly her movements
the girl and her father laugh delighted with this new musician
lestat plays along with them joyful exhilarated
the girls fingers fly
lestats fingers pick up speed
a glittering torrent of notes fly out of his violin as if made of gold
unconsciously lestat steps closer to the music into firelight
the father and his daughter become less certain as they gaze at lestats strange pale glowing skin the luminous shine of eyes
but lestat is completely taken by the music the moment
the father and the daughter sensing something strange stop playing
lestat looks up
sees terror in their eyes
the father is slowly backing away pointing in horror at lestat
lightning fast out of the shadows steps marius
he grabs the father
the girl drops her violin turns starts running down the beach to a bonfire in the distance
stop her lestat
lestat turns to marius shaking his head no in horror
lestat hesitates then runs after the girl
she turns back sees him getting closer starts to scream
lestat is suddenly in front of her with his hand over her mouth covering her muffled scream
her struggle is no use against his strength
reaching up to her neck he touches it
he looks into her terrified eyes
marius kneels over the body of the father on the islands deserted shoreline
tosses him in a boat
lestat gazes at the lifeless body of the girl
marius turns to lestat furious
i will not have you put everything at risk
you will mind our laws
picking up lestats victim marius tosses her into the boat as well
we remain in the shadows
to do otherwise is a road to destruction
marius turns to lestat who stands in silence gazing at the girl and her father
quietly i see you still have a few lingering mortal emotions
they will serve you no good lestat
lestat turns to marius shaking his head speaks in a horrified whisper
my god what have you done to me
lestat turns again toward the bodies of the dead girl and her father his face filled with pain enormous sadness
whisper shes just a child
closes his eyes
a violent violin strain as we pull back to see
lestat standing alone in the bedroom in a deep reverie playing the girls violin with incredible passion
his playing picks up speed as he works himself into a pagnani furor
the faces of my victims haunted me rising behind my eyes reminding me of my fate
i played for days trying to expel the last bit of my human feelings
and face the cold dark wasteland of eternity
the violin dissolves into lestats rock music
reading the journal listening to lestats music
she hears the lyrics
mine eyes dazzle she died so young
she looks up her eyes fill with tears moved by lestats loneliness
she gazes into the dark night
then turns sees her camera
jesse moves steadily along the street past darkened warehouses
several bonfires line the lane illuminating rows of prone bodies cardboard shelters empty bottles
the drunks look up at her with dead eyes
jesse goes deeper into a labyrinth of alleys the street becoming darker with every step
in the distance she sees the blue light
figures moving through the fog
jesse moves slowly along a wall in the shadows trying to get a better look
suddenly out of the shadows a bottle smashes
she starts quickens her pace
runs straight into a bulky figure
a primal scream rises from her stomach
the figure is a homeless drunk more scared than she is who scuttles off quickly into the night
jesse presses her back against the wall
she inches around the corner
and from the shadows gazes at figures knocking on the solitary door in the wall up ahead with the dull blue light mounted above
the slot in the door slides open
a moment later the figures vanish inside
a moment later two couples approach dressed in black
jesse takes a deep breath then
falls into step behind them
one knocks on the door
a face peers out at the group
the door opens
jesse follows the couples in
the door shuts behind her
the music is part blues part kurt weil part gothic dark and ominous as if the pianist knew exactly the sort of trouble jesse was in
the bar is comprised of elaborately carved chinese dragons a tv mounted incongruously in the corner showing a silent vampire lestat video
couples dance cheek to cheek rotating like figures on a music box
another couple is necking hot and heavy in the corner
jesse stares at the patrons of this vampire coven
many of the faces are unnaturally pale gaunt
their eyes shine with a strange reflective light
jesse moves through the tables passing a mortal yuppie type sitting with a vampire girl hes obviously just met that night
this is the coolest after hours club ever
you sure you dont want a drink
the vampire girl smiles glances up at jesse as she passes
jesse looks away quickly moves on
the pianist watches as she passes by
the couple necking in the corner begins to get even more aroused
a mortal girl sips on her drink while her lover a vampire kisses her shoulder her throat
unaware that she is being watched jesse continues her circuit
as jesse approaches the bar where three punk vampires slouch looking up at lestat on the video
we watch the punk vampires and hear every word they say as the other sounds fade away
every covens going
reveal unknown pov
a vampire face hidden behind a hood seems extremely interested in what the punk vampires are saying
a young girl dressed in goth gear sits down at the bar
punk vampire turns and smiles insincerely at her as she stares up at lestat on the tv
getting a sudden chill the goth girl takes her drink and moves back into the crowd as the vampire looks after her with murderous eyes
reaches the punk vampires
they fall silent as she pauses at the bar
she turns stares at the necking couple
a brief glimpse of the tiny trickle of blood on the mortal girls neck as she swoons
an even briefer flash as her vampire lover comes up for air his lips and teeth shiny with blood
come here often
jesse turns to see punk vampire leaning towards her
sure all the time
the punk vampire pulls down her collar
dont see any marks
you havent seen the rest of my body
is that an invitation
jesse finds herself surrounded by the three vampires
she shakes her head too frightened to get out a response
so wheres your host
oh hes here somewhere
she peers into the darkness starts moving towards the door
finds herself blocked by punk vampire
whats his name
jesse looks around trying not to panic
pale faces pale eyes stare at her
a long terrible pause
leans forward surprised studies this strange mortal fascinated
dont know the guy
the punk vampires laugh
jesse desperately tries to cover her terror
marius has the blood of the ancients flowing in his veins
there arent any ancients left
they all turned to dust
thats a myth
marius is around here somewhere
jesse again heads for the door
but punk vampire has appeared in front of her
she stares at him terrified
you really should meet him
and why is that
jesse watches the other punk vampires slowly begin to close in on her
as she speaks she slowly edges to the door
hes wise a philosopher
he asks the big questions
like how are you going to get through eternity
its easier for us mortals
life is brief but for you
she inches toward the door desperately stalling
their white faces gleam menacingly as they close in
she struggles to get the words out
what can you really do with immortality besides just slip from one day to the next trapped in a void of meaninglessness relieved only by your next victim
how do you not give in to despair and just wither away from boredom hopelessness
the punk vampires pause staring at her as her words sink in
the hooded figure leans forward revealing his face
it is lestat
he stares at jesse amazed
jesse glances desperately at the door
its just a few feet away now
you know its like they say the more things change the more they stay the same
for you thats forever right
all around her vampires are turning to look
the punk vampires stare at her eyes narrowing
jesse is now inches from the door
she can barely breathe
punk vampire gazes at her his confusion suddenly turning to anger
you know youre really a downer
he bares his fangs
jesse bolts out the door
pan across vampire faces staring after jesse to lestat who gazes at her absolutely entranced
he watches the punk vampires head after jesse
jesse hurries up the alley
breaks into a run
but the three punk vampires from the bar have somehow gotten outside
they land in front of her beside her behind her
heart racing she shakes with fear
they close in smiling
now this isnt gonna hurt
you might even enjoy it
he runs his hand up and down her body
jesse starts to shake
she breaks out in a cold sweat
the others grin
he picks her up by the throat
her legs flail in the air
suddenly the two vampires turn and hiss like cats
jesse hits the flagstones hard with a grunt
she gasps for air looks up as the vampires are hurled out of the alley by an invisible force
jesse alone turns still woozy
finds herself staring at
jesses eyes open wide entirely stunned
he drinks her in with his eyes marking the soft paleness of her skin her long red hair the flush on her cheeks her pulsing jugular
jesse stares into his entrancing grey eyes tries to gather herself together half fearful half titillated
they gaze at each other the air suddenly electric
you saved me
so you know marius
jesse notices her rucksack cast aside by the punk vampires lestats journal sticks out
she glances at lestat
he mustnt see it
she steps away tries to distract him
i know a lot of things
he gazes at her
moves closer breathing her in making her flustered
not how to stay alive apparently
well i guess weve got that in common
although i think im a little ahead in the race here
a beat surprised at her brazenness well i can fix that
he circles her
jesse is shaking terrified
enjoying the game lestat smiles moves closer
but jesse suddenly blurts out
mine eyes dazzle she died so young
its about the girl with the violin isnt it
that stops lestat
he gazes at jesse surprised
recovers his composure
stares at her intensely regarding her anew
and what else do you think you know
desperate stalling i
i think youre a lot like marius lestat
staring into her eyes probing am i
tell me all about it
youre both artists
hes a painter
youre a singer
as she speaks lestat guides jesse over to a pile of crates
she stares at some beer bottles shattered on the top of one
he guides her hand downward closer to the shattered glass
is that so
what i do is art is it
you try to create
shaking now as her hand gets closer and closer out of the
the cold dark wasteland of eternity
he stares at her the words oddly familiar then scrapes her finger along the bits of broken glass gravel
she gasps with pain
lestat gazes at the drops of blood that appear glistening on jesses finger
softly something beautiful
but marius isnt a rebel
youre different in that way
you dont want to hide follow the laws concealed in the shadows like some insect
you still want to walk with the living dont you lestat
he stares into her eyes slowly brings her bleeding finger toward his mouth
well im not hiding now am i
as her bleeding thumb gets closer and closer to his mouth
no but the only time youre not really alone is when you kill
but lestat you cant help it
its not your fault
he made you this way
with her blood on his lips shakes his head ah
poor poor me
as he brings her finger closer and closer to his mouth
their eyes bore into each other he stares at her rosy cheeks the cold sweat on her forehead taking in her remarkable if foolhardy daring
her eyes gazing straight into his
he brings her bleeding finger into his mouth
she may swoon
lestats eyes burn as he tastes her for mortality her fragility a brief second listening to her blood
theres something there that surprises him as he gazes at this mortal girl
he feels something
then her blood speaks to him as lestats eyes fall on her rucksack
he sees the journal
it all falls into place
lestats lip curls in anger
he shoves jesse away
wipes his mouth
the mood suddenly changes
well talamascan youre certainly a very clever librarian arent you
she stares at him found out
he turns from her laughing but not the kind of laugh to make jesse think alls well
shaking his head how sad you people always trying to know the unknowable
so was it a good read
jesse slowly nods admitting to all
he shakes his head
talamascas been following me for years
ive never known one to be so brave
or is it just foolish
im only an apprentice
he waves her off dismissive
im through with you
your kind never satisfies my thirst
he turns walks away
jesse lets out a sigh of relief then stares after him
she hesitates then suddenly calls out does anything lestat
a pause in his gait
but he keeps walking away
jesse hesitates again but still calls out
i mean whats the point of coming into the light if not to have someone really know you
but he keeps going
she takes one last chance you want the world to see youre real dont you lestat
well here i am
suddenly lestat spins
stares at the fragile mortal girl risking everything
he now stands right before her
he grabs her pulls her to him close tight hard
he could just snap her neck and be done with it
you better just stick to your books talamascan
cause you have it all wrong
i love all this
i delight in it
the dark dreary world i went to sleep in has burnt itself out and been replaced by the th century can you imagine my joy at waking up to discover
such a world
it has outdistanced my wildest dreams of it
i scream of good and evil and mortals stand and cheer
i adore being back in action
every moment every single drop of it
now consider yourself exceedingly lucky and go
he pushes her away
she gasps humbled by his physical power
she retrieves her rucksack
as she reaches the end of the alley she pauses takes a breath turns back daring everything
he turns back stares at her astonished
theres something you left out of your diary
stares right into his eyes you kept her violin didnt you
a beat then lestat shakes his head laughs at the absurdity of what shes saying
but jesse is undaunted
hey its okay
softly after all its only human
that stops him
their eyes bore into each other again
then lestat hisses at her the inhuman sound filling the alley
lestat lunges fangs bared
finds herself in the midst of traffic on a busy street
people walking by
she stands there a moment happy amazed to be alive
then it sinks in
she realizes lestat let her go
she glances back at the alley but lestat is gone
she brings her finger to her mouth slowly sticks it in tastes her own blood shivers with fear and something else desire
what she doesnt see is
lestat in the shadows silently watching her
he gazes at her youth her bright eyes her daring her mortal passion
she has affected him
he watches as she turns and runs away
the camera tracks with two young groupies as they walk through the lavish palace
i heard that lestat keeps all these girls in all his wine cellars and its really nice and they give you food and cable and weed
thats what i heard
but you have to let him suck you on your neck whenever he wants
doesnt sound too bad
grins weve done worse
giggling damn straight
hey do you remember that cute guys name at the kid rock concert
the one behind the bathroom
let me think
his first name was blow
and his second name was me i think
they crack up
lestat enters the bedroom
behind him lestats dressing room stretches off into the distance rows of beautiful suits made from the finest wools and silks
the gradation of colors is spectacular
peering out at the near dawn light a look of loneliness clouds his face
he crosses to the closet
opens a panel to reveal a safe
stares at it a moment
punches in the code
it swings open to reveal something wrapped carefully in black velvet
lestat unwraps it delicately
its the ancient violin
softly clever clever librarian
he quickly puts the violin back closes the safe door
he shakes his head tries to laugh it off
but a shadow remains on his face
lestat hears a gasp
roger has just entered
i didnt see you come in
no roger you wouldnt have
so this house is fine i assume
to your liking
for the moment
well be here for what
a week you think
i wouldnt unpack if i were you
girls you asked for
theyre in the guest wing
lestat gazes at the door pensive
do you want me to take them home later
lestat smiles at the clumsy attempt to protect the girls
no thank you roger
ill make sure theyre taken care of
roger nods trying to hide his nervousness
camera moves out into the lavish room toward the two girls who are now dreamy floating with the effect of the joint they are smoking
reveal lestat as he approaches the girls
looking up they smile childishly at their host then fall about laughing
i dont think weve met
oh my god
its really you isnt it
we want to be your slaves
of course you do
she offers a joint
lestat calmly shakes his head
circling the couches he just smiles
im always hungry
weve got the munchies
you got any food
vampires dont eat
the girls laugh nervously
lestat laughs dangerously
you hungry for something else
she opens her legs provocatively
pacing across the room he stands before the girls
he curls his finger around the first groupies hair when a shadow crosses his face
mine eyes dazzle she died so young
its a very old poem of mine
losing enthusiasm lestat walks away and drops himself onto a couch
with a clap of his hands the tv switches on
he silently watches one of his video clips
the girls glance at each other then giggling crawl over toward lestat
groupie slides her hand slowly up his leg
cmon dont you want to have some fun
she reaches for his belt
but he recoils at the touch and slides off the couch onto the floor with grace
dont do that
giggling are you ticklish
deadpan im very ticklish
the second groupie giggles as well
hey you ever been tickled by four hands at once
hey can you take both us lestat
and at once they both start after lestat on all fours to tickle him
he gazes at them torn then laughs at the sight and gets down on
all fours as well as he leads them around the room in a childish game
i dont know
they try to tickle him but he stays just a few feet ahead of them the whole time
the girls giggle as they pursue
lestat crawling just ahead of them across the floor and
up the wall
the teenagers keep giggling as they watch him ascend the wall like a spider
they cant believe what theyre seeing as
lestat reaches the walls top and now crawls upside down across the ceiling
the girls begin to giggle and half cry
as they arch their necks all the way back to see
lestat crawling down the opposite wall
the girls sit open mouthed with terror as lestat reaches the ground he heads straight for them
the girls begin to scream
screams continue over
close on jesse her face bright walking quietly talking intensely on a cell phone
youre right david
the journal has everything in it
i knew youd appreciate its scientific significance
struggles a moment im going to los angeles for the concert
you are not
i forbid it
i talked to him
look im sorry
i have to see whats out there with my own eyes
im onto something
i just dont know what yet
i have to find out
holding the phone stunned
he leans forward speaks intensely his face grave
jesse you listen to me very very carefully now
you are no longer seeing things clearly
your emotions are clouding things
its not emotion
ill return when i have my findings
angry jesse wait
she hangs up
cant quite believe what shes doing
reveal jesse is heading for a boarding gate at heathrow airport
she hands over the ticket boards the plane
in his inner sanctum
he looks at all the paintings
his neat protected world
its as if marius is taunting him
he slams his fist down in fury
stares at the rising dust
jesse puts on headphones listens to lestats music
as she opens the journal lestats music dissolves into lestat standing alone in the bedroom in a deep reverie playing the violin with incredible passion
his playing picks up speed the bow bending across the strings with a maestros speed and precision
yes marius was impressed with my thirst for knowledge
but it turned out that there was such a thing as knowing too much
there were things marius was not yet ready to teach me
and marius and i parted ways
suddenly the bow flies out of his hand and slides across the floor jamming itself under an old bookcase
lestat comes out of his spell walks across the room to the bookcase bends down to cleave the bow out from under it
having difficulty he pushes back an old rug on the floor when he sees something
carved into one of the floorboards is an egyptian eye with a hole dug out of its iris
stepping aside he realizes he is standing on a manhole
a beat on lestat as he thinks
poking his finger through the hole of the egyptian eye he lifts the manhole to reveal a steep set of steps leading down into the villas basement
lestat looks around wondering what to do
taking a candelabra off the table he ventures down the stairs peering down into the darkness
lestat negotiates a circling flight of stone steps winding its way into the lowest bowels of the villa still carrying his violin
lestat finds himself facing a steeply descending passageway that stretches into darkness
he tests the stones ahead of him with caution
suddenly the sconces along the passageway come to life
in quick succession they flare up and burn with an unnatural intensity
lestat struck with curiosity and wonder puts down his candelabra and ventures forth
we follow lestat as he rounds the corner and stops
there is an open foyer area leading to two great wooden doors held firm by a tree sized carved wooden bolt that bars the doors shut from the outside
suddenly the bolt flies up and splinters with a shrieking crack
the doors fly open revealing a bright light from within
lestat apprehensive continues towards the open doorway
lestat enters squinting through the bright light from scores of burning sconces
at the far end of the sanctuary lestat makes out the shape of two statues an egyptian man and an egyptian woman sitting stone still seemingly staring straight at him
akasha and her king enkil
we recognize akasha from the sketches in talbots office
stepping closer they appear not to be statues at all but rather alabaster humans with the palest skin imaginable
his eyes widen at the sight of their clothes the most valuable egyptian finery bracelets of gold headdresses of incredible gems clothes of silk
staring up into their faces lestat is struck with the realization
lestat is drawn to the woman her form and beauty is exquisite even in its absolute stillness
as if this statue had just asked him to play lestat holds out his violin
would you like me to play for you
her eyes still bore into him
he raises his violin and begins to play
the song of the violin echoes around the walls
lestat plays with increasing abandon
akasha and enkil sit frozen
lestat plays and plays lost in the music
he throws a glance up at the throne and stops
akasha is moving
slowly her eyelids pull back to reveal pale green eyes
lestat stares in amazement
her arm rises up her wrist extended outward towards lestat
the pulse of a heartbeat begins
lestat moves toward her as if beckoned
a green vein appears beneath the marble surface of her skin
the vein pulses as the blood courses around
the heartbeat pounds louder deeper
the sound fills lestats head as he is drawn closer to akashas wrist
lowering himself as if genuflecting lestat bends closer to the vein which looks like the very font of life to him
marius sits under the stars painting when his hand begins to tremble
suddenly he drops his brush startled by some unexpected feeling that passes through him
he stands bolt upright as a frightening gust of wind sweeps across him
lestat sinks his teeth into akashas vein drawing in the unimaginable font
a burst of image and color floods into him as
of ancient egypt
all impressionistic subliminal
the bright burning sun red lips blood spurting like a fountain
in the sanctuary hovering over lestat who lays on the stone floor in a catatonic state staring
marius looks down upon him the sconces above blazing high with flames
mariuss voice echoing furiously
what have you done lestat
lestat lays in bed feverish his skin paler than ever
at the foot of the bed stands marius
the young vampires eyes bulge open in the grip of some incredible sensation smiling the most wicked of smiles
lestats chest heaves upward pulling his body with it only to be jerked back by the manacles that hold him to the bed
i dont think so my little lord
lestat writhes with a physical delight that is almost painful
lestat realizes he is shackled to the bed with manacles and chains
struggles against them
let me go
youve drunk the purest blood
seen the oldest of things far too much for one as young as you
youve been unconscious for days
god her blood is like liquid fire
squirms who are they
she is your mother my mother
akasha the queen of all who are damned
and he is her king
lestat struggles with all his might
one of his manacles splits releasing a leg
marius stares surprised
she made you quite powerful
withdrawing a saber from its sheath dont make me use this
lestat still struggles
the manacles strain
marius please just one more time
i felt the sun
the light marius the light
suddenly pressing the knife to lestats throat lestat listen to me
i have watched over akasha and her king for years
they must never awaken
lestat stares up at him
akasha and her king nearly drank this earth dry when they ruled over egypt
they drank until they lost their will to drink
they became living statues
and yet akasha still sustains the life force of all vampires
it is believed what happens to her happens to all of us
lestat gazes up at him taking it in
marius moves slowly away
if she were ever to rise she would again desiccate the earth
she has no respect for anything except the taste of blood
immortal and human alike
lestat roars and struggles against his manacles
youll not stop me
marius stares at him shocked
i hear her blood in your voice
in all the years ive cared for them not once have they moved
and she chose me
youll not stop me
marius moves at super speed grabs lestat by the neck and pins him down
you are part of a great coven
you take responsibility for your kind
snarls i must have more
lestat lost looks at marius his eyes intoxicated with akashas blood
marius steps back
looks at his fledgling with great sadness anger disappointment
i chose you for your bravery but i was wrong
you know only selfishness
i can no longer trust you
it gives me no pleasure to look upon what i have created
marius turns his back on lestat
lestat stares after him
through the balcony we see the last warm colors of the sunset vanish into the blue of night
lestat awakens his manacles removed
he stretches shakes his head as if clearing his head but something causes him to stop
something has changed
mariuss paints have gone
some of his paintings remain but his easel and paint boxes are removed leaving splattered outlines on the faded marble floor
lestat runs down the staircase which is dark except for the candelabra in his hand
lestat throws open the doors and enters to find
akasha and enkil have been taken as have the thrones and most of the royal paraphernalia
lestat runs down the beach the sand showing no footprints
many times since i have called to marius
i howled into the night in loneliness and pain
lestat screams into the darkness filled with despair grief
he disappears off into the night
but there was no answer just the endless procession of days months years
my teacher left me to my darkest lesson that in the end we are alone
lestat looks up from feeding on a mortal
wipes the blood from his mouth gazes into the dark night
jesse closes the journal her eyes wide with the new knowledge of lestats past
she sits there a moment speechless then stares out at the vast black night
pan down to lestat standing on the edge of a very high fence high above the sparkling lights of downtown gazing into the dark night
the fence encircles his hollywood hills home a high tech modern version of a medieval fortress of steel and glass hidden deep in the canyon his only neighbors chaparral and
lestat closes his eyes as if listening to something
as we pull back again and rise up into the sky a lestat song begins to play and magically we are in the music and with a visual splash we
moving swiftly across the globe with the music as we cut across the world into the west and into
the night fallen over asia where we soon find ourselves in
where lestats music plays for the evening shift over a sweatshop boom box
where lestats music plays from speakers in a shop window
we travel westward to
ground splits open before our very eyes
from out of the dirt a beautiful teenage boy stands naked
he pulls the pieces of a worm eaten coffin from his person as the music travels further to
parting as another resurrected figure rises from the darkness and reveals itself to be
with one self assured twist of her head she shakes the red dust from her hair to reveal long curling black tresses falling down over her dark skinned shoulders
the music travels further to
held by a camel driver camping out in the sahara desert
his camel brays fearfully
the camel driver stares before him drop jawed and terrified and we now see what he sees
a corner stone of a desert sarcophagus begins to move as a figure in tattered rags emerges from the sarcophagus and unbandages his face and neck shakes the sand from
his hair and eyes to reveal a skeletal form with white leathery skin bulging with strange blue veins
the vampire khayman offers the driver a polite smile
the driver faints back into the sand as the camels bolt off
and still lestats music plays as we finally end up an over the shoulder shot of enkil sitting motionless in his throne not resurrecting at all
akasha and her throne remain o
we move closer to reveal
enkils throat gapes torn open and whereas before his skin was pale its now a chalkish powder
and next to him
akashas throne sits empty
a god again walks the earth
a gust of wind suddenly blows and enkil crumbles into white dust
a tall shapely female flight attendant sways down the first class aisle of an airplane her back to us
she stops by a seat where jesse sleeps uncomfortably
pulling out a blanket the attendant drapes it over jesse tucking it closely around her neck then curiously the stewardess leans down
begins to sensually kiss jesses neck
we begin to hear the beating of a heart getting louder
the lips part to expose fangs slowly sinking themselves into jesses skin
she murmurs in her sleep
she stirs awake to see the face of akasha her green eyes flashing bright
wakes with a start
jesse looks up to see the real attendant is standing next to her
weve started our approach into l
you should fasten your seat belt
jesse nods and quickly fastens her belt pulls it tight
lestat suddenly glides through an open door and calmly touches ground
he empties his pockets out on a coffee table
we see a sky bar
dabbing his mouth with a handkerchief lestat tosses it on top of the matches to reveal fresh bloodstains on the cloth
a look of loneliness clouds his face
i hate bedtime
he turns enters his bedroom closing the door behind him
we find ourselves in the strange blue grey world of a vampires pov walking through lestats mansion
past his band james alex and maudy laying in the studio in a hazy sleep from yet another night of debauchery
we move menacingly into
lestats expensive living quarters past the huge glassed in space and into lestats private hall leading to his bedroom door
we enter easily passing the enormous bed and continue through into a smaller darker chamber
over to lestats coffin stealthily approaching his sleeping figure laying closed eyed and almost peaceful looking when
bolts up and looks around the room to see
lestats instincts are as alive as they could ever be as he scans the room with all his powers and to his utter surprise finally sees
a painting leans against a wall turned front side over
lestat gets out of his coffin and goes over to the painting with trepidation
he turns it over and then smiles to himself
it is a portrait of lestat as a rocker
the hand and style are unmistakable
lestat bursts out the doors of his bedroom and looks down into the living room
marius sits on a couch still dressed in red velvet studying the rolling stone with lestat on the cover
marius looks up
the two vampires regard each other for a long moment
lestat is overcome with conflicting emotions
guarded smiles rise to their faces
it is good to see you lestat
still wearing the old fashions i see
old habits die hard
how did you manage to slip through the s in red velvet
dont think you missed much
holding up the rolling stone youre bigger than he is now
id say a few pounds lighter
though if you ever catch me wearing a white jumpsuit you have my permission to slice off my head
if someone doesnt get to you first
lestat grins feeling mariuss disapproval
live and let live
if it were only so simple my son
a beat how did you find me
we ancients have powers no ordinary vampires possess
and i know you
i remembered how you admired the medieval fortresses in the hilltowns of lyon
gestures to house all youre missing is the moat and the cannons
which you may need
lestat doesnt want to hear it
come let me show you what it means to live in the light
lestat and marius sit perched on a giant billboard advertising lestats concert
down below sunset strip is filled with goths club hoppers honking cars a traffic jam
reminds me of mad old druids running around chanting in the forest
very primitive stuff
thousands and thousands
they worship me
millions of arms reach out to embrace beg me to come into their lives
its what youve always wanted
with all my black little heart
do you think of anyone but yourself
i only have myself
it may be time to get ready for some company
whats that supposed to mean
your musics woken a very old friend
lestat looks at marius trying to understand
cant you hear it
or is the applause all you can hear now
marius becomes eerily still
a deep somber tone starts to vibrate
the ground rumbles
lestat taken aback remembers the scope of mariuss power
lestat stares at marius then closes his eyes
as the sounds of the world seem to fade away revealing beneath the cacophony of mortals a deep pulse like the beating of a heart the size of a planet
lestat suddenly opens his eyes as the sounds of the world rush back in
marius stares for a beat then akasha has risen
she has taken her kings blood
absorbed his power
youve done it this time
lestat stares at marius letting the knowledge sink in
then he grins
im glad shes risen
let her come
dont you understand
you must stop this concert
shakes his head at marius years and the same broken record
not the same
youve only known akasha dormant
she too will find you
she is choosing her moment
she has come to destroy you lestat
and in her wrath she will devour everything that moves
mortal and vampire alike
smiles at marius softly well then its every vampire for himself
just the kind of rules i like
the rules you taught me
marius is enraged tries to control himself
lestat gazes at him speaks steadily
do you remember your first words to me marius
i am unknowable
shakes his head id rather not exist at all than have to live eternally as a ghost
and youre taking everyone with you you fool
we were once mortals too
it is our heritage we protect
moving away such reverence for mortals
then you should have left me as one
youre a monster
shakes his head with a dark laugh said the vampire to his son
lestat turns leaps off the billboard disappearing into the black night
marius stands alone
no mortals in sight
amongst various vampires we spy the vampire lover talking to the punk vampire who tried to attack jesse
the vampire doorman opens the door and peers out
a figure moves towards him
glowing beautiful majestic
the vampire doorman is frightened but mesmerized as she moves in
the barman looks up at the sound of the door slamming
he does a double take and watches in awe as
akasha steps in
everyone in the bar turns
she smiles at all the undead staring at her
her eyes sweep the room taking in every inch searching then she hears a vampire lestat video playing
she whirls around quickly to the tv gazes at the video intensely
her eyes narrow focus on lestat speaks as if to herself
his scent is fading
he was here too long ago
the vampire lover slides up next to her
you like him love
still staring at tv he reminds me of someone i know
all hes gonna remind you of soon is a pile of bones
were gonna dismember him
bleed him dry
is that what youre going to do
she turns to vampire lover takes him in
as if with a new idea smiles at him moves to the dance floor moving to lestats music her eyes closed swaying sensually her hips gyrating
the dance is seductive slow her head thrown back
the vampires turn stare at her mesmerized aroused by her movements
they move to the dance floor watching
akasha opens her eyes smiles at them then turns to vampire lover points to him beckons
he smiles back happy to be chosen moves onto the dance floor
she dances a little farther away
he hears a laugh
but shes disappeared
akashas behind him now
he stares at her
her hips are gyrating her body slithering
a moan escapes from him
again he moves to her reaches for her
shes dancing across the floor now
vampire lovers smile is not so friendly now
he steps toward her determined
she moves behind him
her body pressed up tight against his
he smiles shudders with a rush of desire
all the other vampires watch envious
her lips brush his neck her hands run up and down his body pausing on his chest
he reaches for her
she kisses him just as he kissed the mortal girl
on vampire lovers face pure pleasure
then again you could always do this
akasha sinks her fangs into his neck and at the same time plunges her hand down
we cant see where
we stay on vampire lovers face as akasha disappears from frame
the sound of bone snapping the squish of ripping flesh
a look of horror appears on vampire lovers face
in her hand she now holds
his dripping heart
she brings it to her lips sucks again thirstily
vampire lover gurgles as she sucks the heart to a dry husk then tosses it
she turns back to vampire lover his face frozen in a grotesque mask
she laughs drops him unceremoniously to the floor
akasha turns to face the rest of the horrified vampires
they begin to back away
but the door locks itself akasha sways again to the music moving faster now as if refreshed
turn up the music
the terrified barman quickly complies
smiles to herself oh i do love the st century
akasha turns to the terrified barman again pulls him over the bar and attacks him as if she were just reaching for a snack
he flails but is overwhelmed by her strength
the vampire girl who jesse saw vanish with the yuppie flies towards akasha knife raised but akasha just turns
suddenly there is an explosion of flames
the vampire girl screams as she is consumed
the piano player and guitar player go up in flames
all hell breaks loose as the other vampires run for the door
the lock wont budge and its too late anyway as the flames overwhelm them
and through the flames we see akasha smiling now sucking on the punk vampires aorta like its a straw
she tosses his body her long tongue slowly licks her bloody thirsty lips
she strides out through the flames
in a whispery sing song voice
come out come out wherever you are
marius stands in the hills by the hollywood sign gazing down his brow furrowed at lestats fortress like mansion hidden in the canyon below
the wind blows the trees bushes
marius turns uneasy sensing something peers into the shadows cast by the brightly lit sign
marius stares as a figure emerges from the shadows
it is mael a vampire his face hidden in a cloak
marius youve broken your oath
you were to watch over akasha and khayman
you are a great disappointment to me
marius looks up to see all the ancients now stepping from the shadows
khayman the desert vampire in egyptian dress along with pandora the dark haired beauty in her sari armand the boy sage in his mesopotamian robes
last maharet steps from her grand door
she is beautiful with long red hair alabaster skin
pandora armand its been a long time
khayman maharet to what do i owe this honor
you have been summoned because of your errant child
khayman crosses to the edge peers menacingly into the distance at lestats house
giving deep sexy laugh hes quite the devil isnt he
his music mocks us pandora
his music moves my blood
keep your amorous thoughts to yourself
his music is a threat to all vampires
we will let the covens dismember him at his concert
it will set an example
i dont see how this solves things
this isnt thought through
marius we understand your affection for lestat but your duty is to us
he gazes again down at lestats house with a threatening glance
turns to marius with a look of warning
we could always get rid of him right now
we will contact the covens
let them know we condone the slaying
it will be better for all to see
marius with a tortured expression gazes at mael
maharet steps up
never mind lestat
we have greater problems
stepping up maharet is right
it is akasha we face now
joyous is it true maharet
has our queen really risen
dont be so happy pandora
i knew akasha when she walked this earth
i was her slave
i am now her enemy
i know what she is capable of
weve all felt her presence even as she hides from us
as others nod acknowledging the truth of this what does she want now
she knows only one thing
taking pleasure in destroying life
she is already killing the young ones to build her strength
shes sucked the life out of her king like a praying mantis
i sense she is getting closer
she has come to destroy lestat but he will only whet her thirst more
the ancients look to each other taking this in
pandora looks around suddenly nervous
if we act together we have a chance to destroy her
they all gaze at maharet astonished
we must destroy her immediately
if she is not stopped im afraid of what will happen to the entire mortal world
but can she be destroyed
i am left to bear the scars of the last attempt on her life
she was dragged into the sun
but we almost didnt
removing his hood we see his terribly burned face
they all stare at him
what happens to our queen happens to us
if akasha dies we die as well
then so be it
we must take that chance
she gazes at them all intensely as the meaning of her words sink in
we must destroy akasha
for the sake of humanity
we must find her
but perhaps she has come to kill lestat and then will go back to her slumber
that is our only hope
she and the covens will take care of that brat
we must go to the concert and pay our respects to our great queen
with your own throat
youve all been asleep too long
youre still dreaming
marius steps up beside maharet
maharet speaks the truth
it is our only hope
marius then goes and stands beside maharet and khayman
the others gaze at the three standing together now
armand is right
we will go to the concert and first see what she does
there may be no need for action
pandora and armand nod their assent
the two groups face each other
maharet gazes at their faces spits out the words
then you go to the concert and you shall see
shakes her head and i thought the ancients became wise with their years
as we remain on the ancient ones akashas heartbeat creeps back in over
marius gazes again down at lestats house anguish on his face
cruising the hollywood streets wearing sunglasses hat
he sees something
a goth girl on the street in front of a record store
he sighs pulls over
behind him now we see a cab pull over
its jesse trailing roger
she gazes at him intently
rogers back is to us as he talks to a goth girl in a whisper
jesse pays the driver
gazes at roger
loud intense music as the band rehearses
lestat creates a fantastic melody around the beat
he lets the note trail off eyes closed smiling the reverb still ringing in the room
lestat hears something turns
outside in the hollywood hills dogs are howling across the canyons like wolves
lestat crosses to the huge glass doors goes outside
lestat stares out at the ominous night
as maudy and the band continue to play the wolflike howls in the night get louder
and beneath it all a deep pulse beats
the song comes to an end
lestat turns gazes back at the band through the window at their excitement
he comes back inside
roger now stands there a nervous look on his face
girls you asked for lestat
theyre here in the guest wing
lestat gazes in that direction pensive
i was uh
just gonna go catch a movie at the chinese
i dont suppose youd all want to
lestat smiles at the clumsy attempt to protect the girls
no thank you roger
well entertain ourselves
as roger leads lestat to the guest room he can hear faint giggling
lestat turns back to the night
the pulse of akasha still echoes in his ears
roger and lestat walk in
a young groupie giggles nervously
oh my god its him
its really him
she turns in paroxysm of excitement to the girl next to her
lestat stares taken aback
it is jesse
dressed in goth gear
jesse stares back at lestat brazenly
a long moment
perhaps you would like a tour of the place
oh yeah wow wed love that
would you be so kind
surprised relieved sure
right this way girls
as they start off lestat puts up his hand points to jesse
not that one
leave her to me
the other groupie pouts disappointed
she goes out with roger
lestat turns to jesse
you must be very keen to die
jesses heart pounds with terror
the talamascans have become quite stealthy
i didnt know infiltration was quite their style
i came on my own
he stares at her taking her in
how did you find me
ive been tracking your manager for days
gesturing to her goth outfit then i figured out you simply have to look the part
you should know based on all your research that groupies dont ever find their way out of here again
im not a groupie
lestat gazes at jesses pulsing jugular
he steps closer
then why are you following me
what do you want
terrified in a whisper are you granting wishes
smiles in a whisper playing with her last wishes
show me what its like to be you
thats my last wish
grant it lestat
he stares at her feeling some connection with this strange mortal girl
she stares at him with penetrating eyes
he again finds himself drawn to her
tries to fight it
turning away i dont have time for this
all a vampire has is time
the covens are coming for you
softly i understand why youre doing it
you have to be who you are no matter what happens
he turns gazes at her
she steps forward
but how are you spending what may be your last night on earth lestat
as you always have
jesse takes a breath crosses to him stands very close stares up into his eyes
he stares down at her amazed his heart pounding
he breathes in her hair the scent of her skin
dont kill me yet
lets spend our last nights together
share it with me
show me what its like to be you
you dont know what youre asking
i dont know whats in that librarians head of yours but its not what you think
you dont know whats in my head lestat
do you want to
ill know when i kill you
gee lestat thats a great way to get to know someone
ill give you a preview
this is what youll find
she crosses to him stands close
i have this recurring dream that im a child and im living in this big house filled with vampires
and every night when i go to sleep i wish to god the same thing
you know what that is lestat
he gazes at her
she leans forward
that i will have the dream again
because in the dream im happy
and the dream is more real than my life
i dont know how but i know you lestat
my life is a big mystery and you you have the answer
he gazes at her being taken in tries to resist it
jesse moves even closer
he stares down at her the softness of her skin her penetrating gaze the heat of her body
i cant go on pretending this life of mine is real
i cant live a lie
im just like you lestat
were the same
softly are we
i seek the light
you seek the shadows
were looking for exactly the same thing
you know it
he stares at her
her eyes gazing directly into his
jesse breaks into a smile
this may be painful for a mortal
youre still attached to your skin
an excited whisper i dont care
close your eyes
her heart pounding fluttering her eyes closed jesse holds one deep hesitant breath and
flash with preternatural speed
whisk through the night flashing past trees and houses
opening her eyes for a moment jesse watches the world whiz past her at incredible speed and suddenly they stop on a dime
jesse gasps catching her breath to find herself at hollywoods highest peak overlooking the city laying out before her like a glimmering blanket
looking out over the observatorys ledge jesse cant believe whats just happened
she laughs intoxicated by the experience
do that again
lestat laughs impressed by her bravado
for a moment she laughs like a child
then they look at each other deeply feeling something
he wants to kiss her
she knows it
he turns away
and now for my next trick
lestat pulls out a knife quickly slices his arm open
jesse gazes at his blood dripping down his arm something stirring in her
magically the wound heals up
she stares impressed
did it hurt
for just a moment
but as the pain is more intense for us so is ecstacy
gazes at her you see we love our victims
i thought it was the blood
no although the taste is so rich and sweet
love is the essence of the dark gift
the connection is so much more satisfying brief as it is than anything else
lestat again becomes aware of jesses pulsing jugular the white flesh of her neck
he reaches out touches her neck strokes it
jesse shivers under his touch terrified but wanting more
lestat brushes his lips against her hair her neck
runs his hands down her arms
she closes her eyes lost in the gentle rhythm of his voice
as you drink you feel the heart weakening
it struggles even though theres no hope
you feel the life slipping away the flash of those brief years
the taste of mortality you can no longer experience
and it is beautiful
pulls away sharply no relationship no commingling can ever reach the heights of that experience
but jesse steps forward
lestat turns stares at her
her eyes burn with an urge that will not be silenced
one button at a time her fingers quivering she opens her blouse down to her navel
lestat stares as jesse removes a long silver hairpin from the mane of her red locks which then cascade about her shoulders
her face remains aimed unwavering at lestats as she brings the hairpin down to her breast
with her eyes moored to his she draws a line with the point across her breast
she inhales through clenched teeth
then settles as we see the long incision go from pink to red then the blood like a hot spring pouring over the brim and dripping down her chest
breaking their stare he accepts her gift lapping up the overspill and then onto the wound itself
lestat closes her eyes
he comes up to her face brushing his lips against her cheek
groans your blood
murmurs do you like it
losing himself yes
he comes down to her slender neck
stares at the soft pulsing skin
he bares his fangs
whispering overcome do it to me
with your blood ill know you
he cant help himself
he moves to jesses white neck
ill know everything
but suddenly her words catch him
his head flails as he tries to stop his natural impulse
lestat lets out a desperate cry and throws her aside
jesse gazes at him surprised
he looms over her angry
you want to know everything
you want to see what its like
ill show you
lestat and jesse quietly move among the trees
lestat stops on a dime senses tuned
he looks into the dark
jesse is about to speak when lestat raises his finger to her lips and then points at
a couple of lovers moving across the meadow
they sit on a park bench
the woman giggles drunkenly
jesse watches and gasps as she realizes the male lover is a vampire
lestat moves forward
jesse gingerly follows
taking his lover in his arms the vampire begins to bite her neck
lestat looks over at jesse who watches fascinated and disturbed
the vampire senses anothers presence stops and turns to reveal his vampire eyes shining in the dark
lestat steps into the halo of a street lamp and hisses
sensing lestats power the vampire hisses and instantly the vampire is gone
jesse turns to lestat but he has disappeared too
spinning around again she sees
lestat hovering over the mortal woman who is still in a swoon
checking to see that the vampire is gone jesse moves closer to the bench
is she alright
lestat looks up to face her revealing his blood stained lips
jesse reflexively looks away
come closer jesse
you want to see
you want to know
lestats expression turns cold as ice he arches his back like a great cat and goes in for the kill
the womans body convulses
jesse watches in horror as
the womans hands clutch at lestat her back stiffens
finally her legs relax in an obscene parody of orgasm
jesse gasps backs away
lestat finishes and wiping his mouth approaches jesse
you see now
are you ready
now do you want it
he gazes into her eyes finding himself desperately wanting her to say yes
the horror the revulsion in jesses face says it all
of course you dont
she backs away from him now terrified
somethings changed in his eyes
they are cold blank
well i didnt grant your final wish
shakes his head it was an impossible wish to begin with
you see i am unknowable
his eyes still as death he starts moving away
lestat turns toward her suddenly grabs her forcefully pulls her into his arms gazes into her eyes
good bye talamascan
jesse closes her eyes in terror knowing her life is about to be over
then jesse reaches for her mouth as if she were touched by something when
the image of lestats lips kissing her lips flashes by in vampire time as
jesses face is completely still in human time
as her hand drops she realizes what just happened
and with that lestat disappears
she stares into the night
theres a swish and the sound of rushing air
jesse turns screams backs away
its not lestat standing there at all but mael the druid vampire
with great speed he glides towards her envelops jesse in his cloak muffling her cries
pull back to reveal a porcelain doll beautiful perfect but unsettling
we track across rows and rows of dolls from different eras
track past the billowing floor to ceiling curtains to reveal jesse still an adult but lying awake in bed just as she had as a little girl
jesse gets out of bed trapped in her own childhood memory
is she dreaming now
making her way down a long hall she passes an amazing array of medieval tapestries
jesse as a child picking at the thread of a wall hanging in a large room
she stands wondering eyes moving back and forth with rapid thoughts when
she sees a door at the end of the hall
walking a little faster now she draws toward it as
jesse as a little girl wanders down a similar hall toward what sounds like a cocktail party
reaching the thick wooden door she peeps through to see
jesse stares up at an enormous mural dominating the far wall a mural of names a family tree extending up onto the ceiling and down to the floor
jesse as a little girl walking beside maharet looks up at the mural
furious why cant i stay with you
please auntie maharet
i dont want you to go but you must
a tear of blood trickles down maharets cheek
auntie youre bleeding
jesse takes the tear and goes to put it to her mouth but maharet violently grabs her hand
young jesse is frightened
you must be with your own my sweetest girl
ill always be watching over you
i want to stay with you forever
jesse stares into nothingness
again the voice but much gentler
forever is a very long time
jesse looks up out of her memory to see in the doorway down the end of the hall
hello my princess
jesse rushes to her
stares at her aunts glowing eyes the strange pallor of her skin
oh jesse ive missed you so much but i had to keep this from you
jesse stands there soaking it in
maharet takes her hands gently
oh my god this is why
i knew i was different
i knew strongly come
jesse follows maharet to the mural of the family tree
you are the most precious of my great family
you are not
i was once mortal too
my sister died before her child was one year old
i took care of that child and her children and her childrens children
pointing up to the huge family tree
this is our family my way of coping with eternity
the labyrinth of life
the family teaches me the rhythms and passions of each age
her finger trails down the great line to a name jessica reeves
you are my most prized light
you are what keeps me connected to the world of the living
jesse stares at maharet amazed
when your parents died i took you to india to take care of you
and something happened there
i stopped it from happening
and i will again
maharet stands close gazes at her
jesse you must stay away from lestat
you must forget all about him
jesse looks at her surprised
yes i know about your new friend
you think you love him but its not as you thought it would be
jesse stares at maharet surprised she understands so well
i thought i was like him
i know but it is not who you are not who you are meant to be
you have found that out now
jesse sits on a stone bench confused
maharet smiles sadly feeling jesses inner turmoil
lestats all i can think about
i felt like i belonged with him
now i know why
maharet sits beside her speaks emphatically
jesse you must forget about him
you must trust me
gazes up at her a long moment i missed you so much aunt maharet
just then the gloom of the pre dawns light begins to illuminate the windows of the great hall
you will go home to london in the morning
jesse holds maharets eyes
but this is my home
this is where i belong
why do you want to get rid of me so quickly
maharet touches her face gently
now is not the time to be here
the light is getting brighter
you were seeking answers
now you have found them
the family is who you are
maharet goes to jesse wraps her arms tight around jesse
despite the coldness of her skin jesse warms to the embrace closes her eyes holds her tight
then beaten by the sun maharet stands exits into the shadows turns back to jesse gazes at her
you will go home to london tomorrow
lestat stands by his bed playing the ancient violin
a long mournful note
he stops a moment lost in his thoughts
a flash of the first morning light reflects off the ancient wood
lestat puts the violin away
a tear of blood trickles down his cheek
his face is filled with sadness at what will never be
a word escapes from his lips
lestat draws the curtains and enters his sanctum where his coffin sits in the safety of darkness
the sun breaks through the date palms
jesse moves down the hallway past paintings of vampires
she pauses at one of maharet
as jesse shifts the glass over the painting catches jesses reflection
jesse moves slowly until her face just covers maharets
in the reflection jesses eyes now glow with maharets luminescence
jesse stares a long long moment
jesse sits at a desk writing a note torment confusion on her face
dear aunt maharet my whole life ive felt
kind of crazy i guess different from everyone and now i know why
you say i now know who i am meant to be
i have found my answers
you are right
she takes a deep breath
jesse moves to the front entrance gazes at the walls surrounding the front gate
i know you want me to be a regular human girl
but im not
i cant be
she looks back at the house then quickly slips out the gate
maharets sprawling compound sits alone in the empty desert
nothing for as far as the eye can see
lestat is my destiny
i know that now
i love you aunt maharet
jesse walks away from the house
coming to a highway she reads a sign death valley miles
just then a vw minibus barrels down the road in jesses direction
she sticks out her thumb
the minibus pulls to a stop on the shoulder in a cloud of dust
a vampire driver leans out the window not a real vampire just a kid with white face paint and fake fangs
need a ride
jesse peers past the driver to a crowd of goths and fake vampires
the vampire lestat blares from the speakers
we see a line of traffic snake out along a desert road toward a strange red glow rising into the dark night sky
a distant sound of drums beating chaotic rhythms is heard
as we fly closer the drumming becomes louder and clearer
until we are right above an incredible scene
a mass of people gather in a valley of red rock
looking at the scene jesse is bedazzled
pushing through people she disappears into the throng as
as he pushes through the sea of white paint and plastic vampire teeth
but she has disappeared
talbot is jostled dropping his glasses on the ground
talbot crouches down and finds his glasses
reemerging he senses something and looks up
watching him at a distance
next to the real thing all these fake vampires look ridiculous
quietly hello david
i must show you my new paintings sometime
talbot is awestruck the goal of a lifetimes searching
he tries to say something but its too late
marius is moving through the crowd at unnatural speed
enormous pipes spout flames high into the sky run like a corridor of red light along the crowd leading to two enormous egyptian effigies of akasha and enkil flanking a
stage at the top end
and before the stage stretches a mass of human bacchanalian debauchery
woodstock on mescaline
naked bodies pierced and tattooed mingle with the strangest of fashions as crowds gather in circles around their own lit fires drumming out awesome rhythms
the whole place is an enormous flaming mosh pit naked bodies walk across heads of people while others get tossed and thrown
this crowd is determined to get what they were promised
nothing like theyve ever seen
a new world a world of the initiated who have somehow managed to include themselves in the select number of attendees to a sacred rite
and among the mortals are the immortals
amidst them we see the tattooed vampires the armani vampire the others now dressed in cloaks which they use to hide their knives and sickles
standing on the strange rocks are the ancient vampires except for maharet
some of whom cant help but smile at the scene below
marius is now with them
wistful to mael its just like neros day
they scan the horizon the darkening sky
akasha will not be able to resist this
the crowd begins to clap drums from different circles begin to impatiently beat into one deafening rhythm
backstage is all abuzz with pre show energy press everywhere
roger still worrying and sweating
james alex and maudy sit in their own circle jamming with their unplugged instruments psyching themselves up for the biggest night of their lives
lestat stretches out with his eyes closed as the sounds of the drumming crowd begin to make the whole van shudder
roger pops his head in
theyre getting pretty worked up out there
lestat emerges from his honey wagon splendid in his concert costume
he looks ready for business whatever may happen
the band look at each other then look to lestat
this is the moment
he smiles like a father at them
come on children
alex maudy and james start beating out the rhythm with the crowd as they move through backstage
the drum beats rise to a crescendo
jesse makes her way through the throng trying to get closer to the stage
suddenly the torches go out sending the place into utter darkness
a stunned moment
the place goes berserk
we see the dim figures of the band take their places
jesse desperately tries to push toward the front
lestat readies himself as he scans the valley from behind a speaker and sees
wait here and there in the audience set to attack
who smiles to himself
boom the torches relight and an enormous chord surges through the crowd louder than a jet on takeoff
the mass surges forward
the stage lights up in a huge halo of blood red light
the band plays a hypnotic tune that would put the devil in a spell as
we wait for lestat
the band keeps playing the pounding cadence as
the audience doesnt see lestat anywhere and cheers over the sound and it seems as if the whole of death valley is shaking when
lestat appears above the stage inhumanly levitating and
im so glad i decided to rise
shouting after tonight death valley will live up to its name
the place erupts into one solid scream as the band kicks it in
he swoops down through the air over the stage and into their very midst
jesse in the crowd screams up to him
but her voice is lost in the thousands of screams for him
lestat takes the microphone and leans his lips into it letting his voice soar into an inhuman note filling the valley like a demon demanding heaven be replaced with hell
two studio engineers sit dazed
cockney accent could we turn it down a tad
the second engineer looks to the mixing panel
his mics not even up
they stare dumbfounded
the pulsing strain moves into a faster beat as the whole place resonates with the most incredible harmonics the energy throbbing the crowd almost genuflecting in front of this papal
all move and sway except for
jesse desperately squeezing through bodies trying to get closer and closer to
lestat who commands the place with his echoing voice
lestat holds the place in the palm of his hand
lestats dark soul seems ready to burst as he moves his voice into an even higher unworldly octave and then
the vampires move through the crowd
goth girls in the front row weeping
maudy james and alex off in the clouds playing the best music of their lives
the place has gone wild living off its own energy now as waves of sound bounce through the valley band up into the night sky
you want more
the crowd screams
this ones for those whove come for me
all yell that they have but the covens know its for them
lestat launches the band into a new number that makes the previous song seem like a lullaby
he eyes the coven assassins here and there and sings straight to them
his lyrics challenging the assassins flaunting them with satire
jesse whirls around spying the assassins in the crowd
she shakes her head no
the covens need no more encouragement as they begin to move through the crowd toward the stage
we rise up over the crowd to see fifty assassins snaking at preternatural speed unseen to all except us in our inhuman vantage
marius spies the covens slipping through the crowd at a strange velocity
he looks to lestat worried
the assassins approach closer lestat assaults with relentless lyrics
reaching the stage they are suddenly on it roadies run in and are immediately cast aside by inhuman powers
we speed into vampire time as
note in camera no c
the assassins draw knives and lunge determined to dismember lestat
lestat does an acrobatic leap dodging the knives
he rips the microphone from the stand and holds it up just in time
as an assassin is impaled
the assassin squirms and convulses
the crowd goes insane
lestat snarls at the audience as if this really were part of the performance
the assassins attack again this time hurtling massive light stands like they were small spears
lestat dodges them
the assassins break glass bottles lunge with the deadly shards
note band should not be seen in this part of sequence
can hold himself back no longer
he flies over equipment and roadies up into the air
the ancients gaze after him and
he lands square in the middle of the fray
back to mortal time
the crowd cheers at the sudden appearance of the figure on stage loving the show
lestat grins at marius
the band keeps playing
marius hurls a huge light at the assassins
it explodes as it hits them pinning one with shards
but an assassin hurls a sickle at lestat
lestat is struck down his singing stopped
the assassins move in
watch from their rocks
pandoras face filled with excitement
there are too many of them
theyre going to dismember him
armand is enjoying the show
assassins corner lestat and marius blades broken bottles reflecting the spotlight
lestat raises his arms for the crowd
the crowd jeers
lestat looks to maudy and the band
get out of here
the band scampers off stage as the assassins fly past the reverb from their guitars whistle into a deafening pitch
jesse joins the screaming crowds
as the killer vampires make their final move it looks bleak for lestat
but one after the other they spontaneously combust turning hot white to black ash and drift up into the air like strange supernatural kites
the crowd hollers and screams not quite believing what they saw or how it was done when
down in the throng vampires also begin to combust hot flashes of white exploding through the crowd turning into black paper dolls wafting up over the valley crumbling into fluttering
puffs of soot
panic takes over the mass of people running in all directions
jesse remains pinned to her spot
stands in wonder as marius stares up into the high darkness
soft to himself akasha
the valley fills with hundreds of burning kites floating like black ghosts
khayman pandora and armand gaze up at the sky
she is here
stares in wonder and terror at the burning kites
then seizes her chance
she pushes toward the stage against the tide of bodies fleeing
roger is trying to manage the building chaos backstage as the fire marshal and several firemen follow after him
you dont have a permit for any of these stunts
i told you i dont know anything about it
a walkie talkie distracts the fire marshal long enough to allow roger to run
last time i work for a bloody vampire
looking up at the sky he stares in awe
there is a low powerful rumble
the mortal crowd looks around distracted from their panic as they sense something truly awesome
senses it too
he looks up not knowing from which direction the attack will come
the stage starts to shudder and shake violently
jesse now almost to the stage screams to him
suddenly the wooden platform beneath lestat begins to buckle under his feet
fragments of wood explode upwards around lestat
marius loses his balance and staggers backwards
fragments of sharp wood fly into the audience
jesse raises her hands to protect herself
she looks up
akasha rises up through the stage
beautiful and terrifying
she grabs lestat and the two of them shoot up into the air
the crowd stares in awe
jesse is frozen
roger the fire marshal the band everyone is frozen
talbot stares up at akasha his face white unable to believe his eyes
even the ancient ones are stunned to see their queen come to life
scaffolds collapse in an explosion of electrical sparks
note practical explosion
the ancient ones stare up into the sky as
akasha and lestat vanish
jesse stares in horror after them
lestat opens his eyes and finds himself high above the desert the tiny lights of the concert far below
lestat whirls around to suddenly see behind him akasha in an extravagant egyptian robe its sheer cloth of gold draping her godly form
lestat is awestruck
akasha comes to life
akasha still says nothing she advances with a luscious curling smile
why so surprised my love
you called and i have come
lestat is awestruck
there is such an unearthly power in akashas voice
everything seems to hum and vibrate with her breath
never fear me lestat
your wishes have all come true
you have yearned for a companion to share eternity
you have cried out to the world
i have answered your call
akasha spreads her arms moving ever closer to lestat
you are so bold like your music
it woke me
you live your life in the open like i did long ago when i had a king
had a king
hes no more
you are my consort
ive kept you safe alive
you thought it was all you
laughing you have the ego of a king as well
i know you lestat
i know that you crave to have the world at your feet
i have come to give it to you
akasha bites her own lip
blood trickles slightly across her chin
lestat stares at the blood yearns towards it as the pulse of her blood increases
lestat looks at it both wanting and fearful
wrapping her arms around lestat she braces him licks his face
has your tongue lost its taste for blood
but you didnt kill the mortal girl
lestat looks caught
instead you kissed her
now kiss me
note shoot as practical actor against plain night sky as much as possible
akasha rises above him hovers over lestat letting a single drop of blood spill into his mouth
lestat levitates above the ground to meet her as
akasha hovers higher drawing him into the sky until their mouths finally meet and her blood flows freely into him
lestat pulls away as a great surge of power gathers in him and floods his body with an electric rush
be my king
forget about everything else
lestat looks straight at akasha his face flushed
his eyes are empty of everything except her blood
whats your answer
lestat looks at her and then smiles
akashas mouth spreads into a smile
flashes of brilliant light strobe over them as lestat moves to her sucks again
theres a powerful rush of wind that engulfs them as they spin together detached from time and space
all intercut with akashas skin her body taut and arching
lestat falls back in ecstasy
he shakes out his body and lets out a howl of pleasure feels his arms his chest his groin as akashas blood courses through his veins
akasha watches and waits
finally lestat grins boyishly through bloody teeth and wipes his lips with the back of his hand
can we try that again
akasha smiles at him then laughs a strange laugh a kind of purr growl
lestat gazes at her as the sensual hissing seems to surround him
it is seductive and scary
lestat steps up puts a finger to her lips
show me the world
akashas mouth spreads into a smile and she yanks him up into the air and off into the night
mael leads jesse down the hall
she stares ahead at what looks like statues standing in the shadows
her eyes widen as the statues come to life armand pandora khayman marius are talking in hushed tones gathered before maharets great family tree
camera sweeps over the endless lines the rows of names that stretch down the stone wall across the floor filling room after room
the ancients all stare deeply moved
maharet turns to them
we see now what akasha means to do
rule as queen again
pointing to the great family this is why we must fight akasha
maharet looks around determined challenging each of the immortals
for the sake of all mortals
she must be stopped or the mortal world will end
the ancients fall silent as they take this in
they gaze again at maharets great family humbled for a moment by her lifes passion
but is there a way
we dont know
when she opens herself to give her blood she is vulnerable
then we weaken her
drain her of almost all her blood but leave her just one drop
we cant take that chance
we must finish her
if she dies we all die
were damned no matter what happens
maharet gazes at them her mind working
pandora khayman mael gaze at each other still uncertain
and what about lestat
lestat has joined with akasha
he is lost to us now
he is never coming back
i dont believe that
beaming with a possessed look his eyes brimming with visions
lestat opens his eyes and sees an island approaching
in the distance lights sparkle as an enormous plantation villa is revealed nestled into the far shore
lestat and akasha stand on a cliff top
wind rips through the trees
everywhere there are torches and a million candles light the vast house
lestat and akasha glide past the forest of exotic flowers
past the fountains and statues up the steps to the open french doors
long white curtains billow in the sea wind
where are we
we are home
you live here
we live everywhere and anywhere we choose
the world is our garden
lestat steps in through billowing curtains stops
there are three west indian girls young voluptuous beautiful dressed in simple working clothes and traditional head wraps
they stare at lestat nervous yet fascinated
they move towards him
lestat finds himself surrounded by hands touching him reaching beneath his shirt pulling his clothes from his body
he swoons closes his eyes smiles
sniffs their skin their blood
they serve the living goddess and her consort
they find you beautiful
you are a god in their eyes
golden dark hands pull clothes away from lestats white skin
breasts strain through white linen as they press themselves closer to him
the surface of water scented with red rose petals
lestats white skin breaks the surface
lestat is lowered into the bath his skin alive with the dancing candles reflected in the water
the water laps gently strange sighs of pleasure as girls hands caress lestats torso
their hands reach down lower and lower through the water
lestats eyes remain closed but his mouth opens
now its akasha kissing him
lestat responds but his eyes sneak a peek
akasha smiles takes his head in her hands she kisses him pushes him back he tries to resist he cant startled by her strength
akasha kisses his neck his chest bites
lestat arches in ecstasy
akasha rises up from his breast blood on her lips smiles goes back down and drinks
now moved to the bed surrounded by the fine nets
kissing probing each others bodies floating above the bed
akasha rolls him over smiles down at him a fang exposed
she draws her wrist across her mouth
a globule of blood smacks lestats open lips
flash a thousand images in a second
lestat jolted as if by a million volts
blood smears their bodies they bathe in it
the most lascivious smile spreading over his face even as the waves of pleasure still course through him causing his mouth to twitch and tremble
he closes his eyes
opens his eyes
he sits up alone in the canopied bed disoriented
akasha is nowhere to be seen
he looks toward the window
the sun is just about to disappear below the horizon
lestat stares amazed blinking
shielding his eyes lestat goes to window gazes in awe at the setting sun
as the last rays slice through the sky lestat closes his eyes stretches his arms out feels the warm sun on his skin
he smiles at this feeling hes craved for so long
still smiling he opens his eyes blinking from the light
he turns gazes towards the bath and gasps
the dying light illuminates
the servant girls bodies now grey with death lying around the edge of the bath
the roses are now black and the water is colored a rich deep red
lestat steps into the hallway stares at dead bodies sprinkling the ground both servants formally dressed and guests in white tropical evening dress
the candles have all melted forming pools that spread across the lace cloth
food sits uneaten on plates
the last of the suns rays strikes ten dead bodies sitting around the table some slumped onto their food some frozen in death
lestat moves through the room a feeling of dread spreading
we follow as he moves
out the french windows onto the beach bodies of servants and villagers are scattered
lestats feet step down the wooden stairs onto the sand through the bodies
lestat shielding his eyes stares up in horror at the pink sky
behold our kingdom
lestat sees akasha standing further down on the beach
puzzled why not
this is the reason you have risen
they believed in nothing now they are nothing
but you and i will change all that
we will give the world something to believe in again
akasha smiles raises her hand suddenly slices her wrist with a knife
lestat stares at her dripping blood
she crosses to him her eyes locked on his
she lifts her wrist drips her blood into lestats mouth
lestats eyes glaze over again
he smiles feeds hungrily lost again
come my king
we have a score to settle
the queen and her king swiftly fly up into the darkness
the ancients are still debating
suddenly the whole place begins to shake
note practical shadows not c
a shadow passes over the ancients faces
the windows along one side of the hall explode with a startling gust
the ancient ones look up to see
akashas silhouette looming dark and foreboding
it warms my blood to see you all gathered
plotting against me
they trade glances and begin to fan out around the room
you will address my king first
lestat enters his possessed eyes showing only evil now
unable to help herself
he turns slowly to the corner where she sits
they lock eyes
lestats face stares cold and hard
what has she done to you
made me see
taking his arm akasha draws lestat to her
the ancient vampires subtly position themselves under the medieval weapons hanging on the walls as marius moves toward his son
she is my queen
marius looks for some recognition in lestats eyes
there is none
maharet turns to akasha
the world has changed since you reigned
then we shall change it back
humans are animals brute creatures
their destruction can only make sense
weve found other ways to co exist
in the shadows
for respect of mortals
they are nothing to us
they are only
she casts a dangerous eye towards jesse
maharet instinctively moves forward to protect her
still trying to hold onto what i took from you
maharet doesnt even flinch
venomous you think you can change my will
im tired of this discussion
join me or die
i will not
i will not
i want to hear it from every one of you
what will it be
akasha scans the faces of the other ancient ones staring deep into their souls
akasha sees khayman glance at the family tree
akashas eyes blaze with anger
dont tell me you have feelings for these ridiculous mortals
she crosses to the family tree traces the names down to one
akasha is beyond fury yet she keeps her temper under control and turns to lestat
do you love me
smiling she bites her lip letting a drop of blood glisten there tempting lestat
he draws closer
jesse stares mortified
akasha and lestats mouths almost meet when akasha pulls away
akasha slowly turns to jesse
shes nothing to me
just the same id like you to kill her
to the ancients ive had enough of this great family
its time to end it
maharet steps between lestat and jesse
you will not touch her
akasha flicks her wrist
maharet is hurled against a pillar pinned by akashas hand
you still think to challenge me maharet
i beg you spare this child
maharet struggles but akasha is too strong
jesse gazes at lestat
then steps forward
its all right maharet
maharet stops standing fixed with the sound of jesses newly strong and calm voice
jesse looks to lestat straight into his dark irises her gaze absolutely unwavering
its what i want
i am ready
she reaches up pulls aside her shirt revealing the top of her breast
a thin red scar remains from where she cut herself with the silver stick from the chinese barrette
lestat gazes at her begins to advance
jesse keeps her gaze steady into lestats risking everything
smirking how sweet
lestat moves closer and closer to her gazes into her eyes hesitates for a moment then continues on
jesse watches him with absolute love
he reaches her
maharet flies across the room but akasha meets her halfway
grabs her by the hair
maharet struggles but akasha is much more powerful
jesse offers up her neck to his bite
maharet looks away and akasha looks pleased as
lestat sinks his teeth into jesses neck
jesse gasps with the bite but puts her arm around lestat as he draws her into him draining her of her very life force as she holds him
with that maharets great family mural begins to weep blood from every name
all the ancients turn stare at the mural as
lestat drinks and drinks and jesse sighs with intimacy clutching his neck and back and drawing his bite deeper into her flesh
she slowly crumples to the floor being drawn down until finally
jesse lies on the floor eyes closed and pale
good bye great family
she turns to the mural with a fierce gaze
it explodes crumbling to a million pieces on the ground
maharet stares in horror
now my children remember your real family
she turns to them with a killing smile
but my queen youve forgotten my reward
she turns to him
my king youve just earned your crown
lestat smiles with a blood stained mouth
akasha approaches lestat and offers him her vein
she looks scornfully at the others as he cradles her wrist
you see how he obeys
you will or you will all die
lestat looks once at marius then sinks his teeth into its original font
he drinks as akasha gasps with pleasure at giving so much pleasure to him
she keeps smiling to the others
but lestat doesnt stop drinking
akasha looks back to him her face changing
thats enough lestat
still lestat doesnt stop
note scene as scripted here is quite different from what was analyzed in boards
notable potential expense or savings indicated with brackets
but lestat clamps down even harder
akasha thrashes trying to release herself
maharet and marius realize what hes doing see the chance lestat has gained for them
a silent signal passes between them as
the ancients make an instantaneous decision
akasha looks up gasping in time to see maharet marius khayman armand mael pandora flying towards her
akasha lets out a hiss
most of the ancients are thrown to the ground while mael ignites in mid air
maels skin bubbles
he screams the veins in his face rise up and explode as if his blood were burning acid
pandora too bursts into flames
she falls to the ground
but lestat strong with akashas blood keeps his hold and khayman armand marius maharet fly at her again
they swarm over akasha
she rises into the air thrashing about but they hang on forming a flying mass of flailing limbs
the thump of akashas heart accelerates as they try to drain her
akasha turns on khayman to incinerate him
he screams as his blood boils exploding out of his fingertips but he doesnt ignite
his wounds quickly heal
he moves in for another attack
the ancients are still flung around by akashas great strength but they all hold on as the thrashing finally begins to subside
the mass of bodies sinks to the ground
the ancients pull back to reveal that
akashas skin is deathly blue white
in horror she manages to spit out her words
you kill me you kill yourselves
the ancient ones look to each other uncertain a moment
akasha gazes at them then turns slowly fixes her gaze on lestat
he gazes back at her
suddenly akasha takes her chance rises her eyes flare green marshalling the last of her wrath
lestat cries out in agony as smoke rises from his limbs
fiercely determined lestat bites into akashas throat this time for the kill
akasha sinks her nails into his throat
he hangs on his teeth deep
they are locked in mortal combat
akasha slowly sinks to the ground real fear in her eyes as her strength finally vanishes
you must stop
lestat pulls away leaving akasha hanging in a twisted unnatural angle
they all stare waiting to see what will happen
maharet moves quickly
she strides over to akasha and sinks her fangs into akashas neck
akasha struggles but this time she cannot even rise up
maharet does not stop
a howling sound as if from hell fills the room
the ancient ones stare at akasha step back in awe
lestat sits up burned but still alive to see
akashas skin begins to grow horribly pale to harden and cake into a chalk
theres no blood left to flow from the gaping holes in akashas flesh
she slowly begins to transform back to her frozen statue state
her skin returning to marble
cracks multiply becoming fissures
finally akasha literally falls to pieces smashing on the stone floor like porcelain
a silent moment
the ancient ones look at each other astonished as they realize theyre still alive
whisper we survived
the ancients let out relieved hisses
but lestat is only concerned about jesse
he rushes to her picks up her lifeless head takes a dagger from the floor and slices his wrist
he brings the open vein to jesses mouth but shes not moving
lestat bends down to her ear and whispers
i left you one drop my love
drink deep and live
jesses lips slightly move and quiver as she tastes the blood
she begins to take the blood inside her and then finally truly drink and revive as lestat cradles her
she pulls away gasping
lestat looks into her eyes
i thought id lost you
drink my love
her lips move to his wrist
lestat strokes her hair soothes her
jesse gasps as pain courses through her
lestat holds her close
she looks up at him their eyes are locked together
i will never leave you again
he holds her tight in his arms
all the ancients gaze at lestat now understanding what he did
slowly jesse rises gazes at lestat her face pale her eyes glowing
then jesse turns stares at maharet
all the ancients turn follow her gaze
a whiteness is spreading across maharets face and skin
maharet stares at her arms and legs slowly turning to stone
jesse goes to her
my child let me look at you
you are finally happy
it is as it should be now
i will watch over you always
maharet reaches out embraces jesse
then maharet sinks into a chair and freezes into a statue
a reverent whisper she took akashas last drop took akashas death into herself
behold our queen
our new mother
the ancients slowly bow to maharet
jesse slowly slips from maharets arms
goes into lestats arms
no she will live forever
she sleeps and dreams of us
jesse and lestat hold onto each other gazing at maharets face
on maharets lips is the most content of smiles
jesse wipes away a tear
marius turns to lestat
their eyes meet
then marius bows at maharets feet
my queen i will watch over you always
the sun has long disappeared as the darkness settles
the shadows creep up the doorway
talbot sits at his desk covered with news clippings
images from the concert
rock n roll nightmare
drugs in water supply
the headline band starts world tour but where is lestat
talbot looks up to see jesse and lestat looking over his shoulder
he leaps out of his seat
sees the change in her instantly
smiles david this is lestat
he looks at lestat fear in his eyes
how do you do
charmed im sure
i told you id return with my findings
here they are
david stares shaken
but please sit down
youll have to excuse me
its just so
david looks sadly at jesse
please dont be sad
im where i belong
im happy now
lestat content for the first time since weve known him looks lovingly to jesse
a flicker of curiosity crosses davids face
excuse me for asking but
smiles whats it like
do you want to find out
im too old to live forever
well if you ever should change your mind
i have a present for you
from an old friend
she hands talbot a canvas
its a painting
he stares at it
the painting shows lestats concert
and in the crowd talbot finds marius now looking straight out at the viewer a smile on his lips
talbot sees standing beside marius is talbot himself dancing with a young pretty goth
and marius sent a message
you were right
he doesnt go to the dorchester
but hes gonna be at claridges later
talbot stares at them
well i guess this is good bye
take care of her lestat
talbot looks at jesse once his spiritual daughter
good bye jesse
talbot closes his eyes to shut out a tear and jesse is at his side and leans down to whisper in his ear
good bye dear friend
talbot opens his eyes to say something but theyre gone
talbot turns to the painting
stares at marius for a long moment
then stands grabs his coat heads for the door
jesse and lestat come out of the talamascan headquarters
he takes her hand and together they float up over the wall and out to the street
lestat pulls jesse into his arms
its long deep romantic
they pull away gaze sweetly lovingly into each others eyes
and exchange happy fanged smiles
shall we go get a drink love
she smiles nods
lestat and jesse take each others hands move into the crowd zipping through the streets at that strange preternatural speed
and vanish into the night
