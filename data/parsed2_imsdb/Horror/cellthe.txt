b if window
href b b the cell grains of sand dance in the wind
as we glide over a vast desert the speck of dust becomes a horse and rider
catherine young straddles the beautiful black animal her mesmerizing eyes scanning the horizon
a curious breeze blows across her exquisite face and she drinks it in as if the wind itself were telling something to her
catherine sees a flickering light in the sand
she pulls the reins and the horse stops moments before the dune drops into nothingness
she dismounts affectionately scratches the horses neck and follows the light
when she looks over her shoulder the arabian is now a childs wooden hobby horse
not surprised catherine smiles and walks down a dune sand sliding beneath her feet
she finds herself in a valley of dead trees whose decayed gnarled limbs appear to form hands
the light dances across her face
she shades her eyes and pinpoints the source
a small mirror reflecting rays of bright sun housed within a locket and chain
its held by edward a haunted looking boy of seven with a precocious grin and piercing eyes
he sits on a fallen tree trunk patiently waiting for her arrival
thanks for the horse
hes a shy child yet comfortable with catherine
you liked him
edward smiles delighted he made her happy
but i thought we were going sailing
the boy frowns
a devilish glint in his eye edward redirects the mirror
catherine follows the flicker to a toy boat in the sand
we cant fit into that
edward shines light in her eyes momentarily blinding her then snaps the locket shut
when her vision clears catherine sees a giant ship perched among the dunes
a craft weighing hundreds of tons just sitting there in the desert
she walks toward it but edward doesnt follow
coaxing him come on mister e
she extends her hand but he adamantly shakes his head no
nods at the ship s broken
finds herself standing on the deck
calling to him who says
no you dont
mocky lock is the bogeyman
mocky lock wants me where i am
i bet we can fix it
she opens a rusted iron door
it makes an horrific screeching sound
similar to metal on metal but more piercing more pained
as if made by a living thing
familiar with the noise a warning to him ed ward
the boys face contorts turning into something half human half animal
he screeches trying to frighten catherine but she cocks her head
no more mocky lock
the creature sticks its tongue out and dives
but its too late
edward mocky lock slithers into the sand and disappears
resigning herself to a failure she opens the palm of her left hand revealing a small bump in the flesh between thumb and forefinger
she presses hard and
we are looking at a large screen showing an electronically generated three dimensional view of a human brain featuring color coded neurological activity
in a specific section of the image cells flash from yellow to red
pull back to reveal henry west surrounded by computers monitors electronics and keyboards
miriam kent stands before a peculiar diagnostic machine scrutinizing data and images
both wear garb favored by surgeons or microchip assemblers
the impressive weird computer system hums as it shifts programs the unusual brain image changing colors
through a large window we see into an adjoining room within which a human figure hangs suspended in mid air by a series of cables designed to simulate flotation
at the console miriam uses a pen to hit specific areas of the touch sensitive screen changing the complex chemical symbols displayed there
in the procedure room a series of pharmaceuticals are injected into an intravenous tube feeding the sleeve arm of the figure
a featherweight cloth mask electronically rises revealing the sleeping face of catherine
at the console miriam hits a button and speaks into an intercom microphone
sing a song of sixpence
in the procedure room there is no reaction from catherine
sing a song of sixpence
hoarse groggy a pocketful of rye
four and twenty blackbirds
catherines eyes open
baked in a pie
in the control room henry hits a switch and catherine is lowered to the pedestal
miriam checks monitors displaying catherines vital signs and continuing what must be a routine presses numbers on a keypad to open the pressurized airtight door separating the two areas
in the procedure room lights come on and miriam eases catherine out of the apparatus
she checks her pupil dilation pulse throat and reflexes
she pokes and prods with a familiarity that would seem rude to an outside observer but is nothing to them
getting to her feet we see that catherines bodysuit is made of an unusual dark fabric almost liquid in consistency
at the console henry moves to another section and for the first time we see there are two elaborate neural monitors
and the brain pictured here is smaller
is doing fine
reveal a second figure suspended from the ceiling in the procedure room
a small boy is lowered to the pedestal and as miriam records data catherine removes the childs mask displaying the haunted face of edward
clearly the boy is in some kind of catatonic state
did we go sailing
mocky lock showed up
mocky lock is the bogeyman mocky lock wants me where i am
mocky lock is a pain in the ass
henry communicates with them via the intercom
where did that come from again
catherine looks annoyed how could he forget
a nursery rhyme
catherine detaches the cables and eases edwards frail body into a waiting wheelchair
miriam takes a penlight and examines the boys eyes
an emotionless void oddly beautiful
thinking aloud nursery rhymes fairy tales the bogeyman
all preparation for the horrors of the real world
making certain the child is comfortable catherine covers him with a blanket rests a teddy bear on his lap and pushes him into the control room accompanied by miriam
henry types in a command and moves to join them
a buzzer sounds and another door hisses open
a constantly fretting administrator barry cooperman is waiting for them in the corridor
edwards parents are here
we can see it in catherines face this isnt good news
situated in a corporate industrial area north of san diego california a series of well secured buildings form a mini compound
a sign near the gate reads campbell center a although this is a hospital room filled with medical equipment its sterility has been camouflaged with toys posters photographs and drawings
to make it more homey
some hint at aspects of edwards fantasy world
every comfort has been provided and no expense spared
henry miriam and catherine now wearing funky casual clothes under a lab coat stand opposite cooperman
sitting on the bed with edward is ella baines an elegantly dressed woman in her mid s
there is a soulfulness to her but the husband lucien baines s possesses the icy demeanor of a corporate tycoon
one might write him off as cold but we sense a genuine love for his wife and child
ella smiles and caresses edwards hair
he needs a haircut
ill tell the nurse
sensing something in edward god he loves when you visit
my husband wonders if thats true
delivering bad news he wants to place edward in a hospital
seeing an unfunded future henrys ready to disassociate himself from miriam and catherine
there are other applications for the scanner mr
i realize that henry
to miriam and i know your work dr
kent is invaluable to this company
you dont know about me though do you
catherine weve waited eighteen months for signs of progress
theres been progress
yes but there is no proof the procedure works
all i have is a belief that your interaction with my son is not a hallucination
catherine is hurt and vulnerable due to exhaustion and the intensity of her experience with edward but feels she must defend herself
to cooperman miriam henry you picked me remember
and i took the job
this is the next wave and i want to be part of it
no one is doubting your ability
then what is it
introspective and solemn eyed lucien takes a moment then ive invested millions of dollars in this study
and ive convinced others to do the same
i suppose i should feel responsible to them but i dont
i could care less if they see a profit
im responsible to my boy thats all that matters
looks her in the eye you tell me
am i doing the right thing
at first were not sure where we are or whats happening
its too bright the space confining
as our eyes adjust we seem to be in a bathroom or shower stall
we hear a woman crying and the camera finds anne vicksey
dark circles beneath eyes red and puffy from crying
hair wet and ratted
sweater and pants damp and stained
barefoot she shivers from cold and fear
pull back to show more of her surroundings
the white tiled x room features a shower head toilet and a push button spigot for drinking water
two walls are solid the other two mirrored the glass covered by thick clear plastic
the floor is littered with empty food wrappers candy bars juice boxes
in the center of the floor is a drain and above her on the ceiling a fluorescent lamp also encased in clear plastic
there is no door
a mechanism clicks
then a rumbling
anne seems to know whats coming
she presses against the wall removes her arms from the sleeves of the sweater hunches down and raises the garment over her head forming a tent
water erupts from the shower head
there is no steam so this water must be cold
shaking anne whispers a count to herself one one thousand two one thousand three
and so on
the spray hits everything in the room mirror toilet floor and a food wrapper drifts toward the drain
she peeks up from the tent but the water has not stopped and that isnt what she expected
we hear a soft sucking noise and a click
the wrapper rises on a puddle of water
anne pounds her fist on the wall
angry scared a puddle forms around her feet and she realizes the drain has somehow been sealed shut
her panic intensifies as we hear another click and the water pressure increases
in the darkened procedure room miriam finds catherine standing between the two suspension devices alone
catherine turns nods and tries to smile
has she been crying
miriam steps further into the room
he hates me
i wouldnt say hates
dislikes distrusts maybe
exactly what miriam wanted
she adores you
she thinks i can bring edward back
someday you can
we all believe that
catherine halfheartedly nods but her mind is elsewhere focused on the two apparatuses
i want to try it
miriam knows what this is about
weve been over this a dozen times
a trial run
what harm could it do
i dont want to find out
ever the doctor miriam finds herself surreptitiously examining catherines eyes flesh tone a slight trembling in her fingertips
why is it taking so long for us to reach him
because weve been reactive thats why
and we need to be active
miriam reaches for catherines wrist and takes her pulse
as miriam examines her catherine continues he creates the obstacles he decides which games to play
ive heard this argument before
its not happening
frustrated it could take years for me to get past the barriers hes created
if we reverse the feed and bring edward into your mind it could be devastating for him
imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world
i do it all the time
yes but youre a willing participant
picture edward in a strange place lost frightened
id be there for him
and he might blame you for terrifying him
that one moment could erase all youve accomplished
and if that happened the trust he has in you is gone
defeated okay okay
miriam takes a penlight and examines catherines eyes
besides i dont know what it might do to you
youre already exhausted
concerned have you been sleeping
i can prescribe something
catherine shakes her head no
miriam shuts off the penlight and looks at catherine with professional and personal concern
any more nightmares
we need you healthy and relaxed
youre going to eat well meditate exercise and watch mindless television
i dont want you up all night reading edwards case file of the nine millionth time
balance dear girl is the key
leave the work here
she taps catherines head
dont bring it home in this
miriam gathers her belongings
henry wants me to try this vietnamese place hes wild about
want to come
declining ive got to feed my cat
besides i want to get to bed early
thats my girl
miriam exits but catherine remains still curious what could happen if things were reversed
the corridors are dark and most everyone has gone home
at the nurses station a staff member observes the child on a closed circuit monitor
further down the hall miriam and henry exit
wearing a chic thrift store coat and lugging a worn book bag catherine stands outside edwards room watching him sleep
pleasant dreams mister e
a green ford pick up truck cruises down this deserted stretch of two lane blacktop the driver carefully maintaining the speed limit
he signals and exits
the truck rumbles along a stretch of bumpy unpaved road
the area is desolate depressing and deserted
it feels like no ones been anywhere near here for years
the pick up stops at a rusted gate and the driver a tall lean sinewy fellow undoes a combination lock and chain
we do not yet see his face
the truck parks inside a charred barn now hidden from view and the driver steps out followed by his dog
a magnificent white german shepherd
we notice a glint in its blue eyes the animals an albino
the driver points and whistles
well trained the shepard sprints to the gate and waits keeping a watchful eye on the road
from the outside a passerby would never know this sanctuary existed
within the foundation of a farm building never completed we find a small room in the center of a much larger space
we hear the whir of electronic equipment and notice video cameras mounted on tripods pointed at the two way glass
we follow cables to a massive video recorder the type used in surveillance able to record for days without maintenance and an elaborate timing device connected to a series of
valves and switches
as if in a beatific trance the driver moves to the window and gently rests his palm on the glass
arms flailing mouth gasping eyes filled with dread
the last spark of life
the driver jumps startled and frightened
almost shamefully he turns and hides unable to look at her
suddenly his body tenses and writhes as if seized by torturous pain
he opens his mouth in a silent scream
and then quickly as it came the pain subsides
hidden in shadow he breathes deeply regaining self control
he waits then moves back to the glass
annes dead face floats past him
he watches her and leans his head against the window closer
and the driver catches his own reflection in the mirror
meet carl stargher
small and isolated the nearest neighbor a block away
the place is a mess
computer print outs dirty dishes unopened mail videotapes and notepads cover tables chairs and floor
on the crammed bookshelves psychology texts sit next to volumes on mythology religion and the occult
totems figurines and artifacts central and south american in origin adorn the walls and tables
as portishead plays on the stereo we find catherine suffering from insomnia wearing goofy yet hip eyeglasses sweatpants and a ucsd t shirt sharing a late night snack with her
she shuts the refrigerator door and we linger on an odd postcard taped to the surface
a kitschy postcard of a warrior goddess
we move out of shadow toward a bright focused light following the albino german shepherd valentine as it enters a vast subterranean room
most of the walls have been knocked down leaving only thick support posts
valentine finds stargher in a dugout pit about five feet deeper than the rest of the room polishing a stainless steel table
a bright tungsten work light hangs above and near it is the chain cables and hooks of a customized mechanical hoist
the dog picks up an unpleasant scent and follows it to a far corner where there are empty jugs of bleach sitting next to a long deep cast iron tub
stargher whistles and valentine obediently retreats to a kennel cage
stargher gives him a chew toy and locks the dog inside before moving to the tub
soaking in the bleach is the nude corpse of anne vicksey
the interior of the tub is glazed with gleaming porcelain and the whiteness of her flesh makes it appear as though she is floating in nothingness but what hypnotizes and
appalls are her eyes
wide open transformed by the chlorine into something ghostly they are unforgettable
as the bleach gurgles down the drain stargher lifts anne from the tub and carries her to the table
he places her face up and dries her with a clean white towel
he moves her limbs lips hips and hands into desired positions then retreats into shadow
in the harsh light against the shiny table the bleached body has the quality of an apparition and we almost expect her to move
we hear stargher remove his clothes and he steps into the pool of light
nude we see that his lean muscular frame is laced with some rough tatoos
when he turns his back to us we find eight metal rings thick and strong pierced through his flesh
two columns of four on either side of the spine running from shoulder blade to just below the waist
what in gods name are they for
stargher shuts off the work light and moves to an area where he keeps television monitors and vcrs
he inserts a videocassette taken from the surveillance deck and watches the screen
in black and white we see anne awaken in the cell
her first moments inside
disoriented terrified trapped she examines her surroundings
stargher is mesmerized by her fear
fast forwarding to her death he presses a remote and we get sound
anne screaming begging for her life
aroused stimulated stargher drinks it in like a symphony
valentine cowers in the back of his cage hating this
lying on her bed a waterbed catherine sleepily stares at the ceiling rolls onto her side and feels herself drawn into the comforter
the folds of the fabric become ripples
ripples become dunes
and we find ourselves in the desert of edwards world
we fly over dunes and come up behind catherine as she struggles through waves of sand
the tree trunk is up ahead and we glimpse someone hiding inside
mockey lock erupts from within the tree trunk
catherine retreats silently screaming
in her own bed catherines eyes are open
in sharp contrast to a typical reaction to a nightmare she remains calm
no sweaty face no gasp no reaction at all really
she might as well have been dreaming of puppy dogs
wide awake her eyes return their gaze to the ceiling
chains attached to bizarre hooks dangle from the ceiling
admiring annes body stargher links the hooks to the rings in his back
he presses a remote unit and up in the rafters a series of gears click into motion
the sound is torturous as the mechanical hoist lifts stargher off the ground pulling at the rings strips of flesh rising
stargher grimaces but clearly he wants the pain needs it
as the hoist clicks into another gear it carries stargher over the table until his body is perfectly positioned above annes
in the flickering weird light of the television screen stargher resembles something from the twisted imagination of william blake a levitating demon ready to debauch an innocent angel
with his free hand he touches himself chains clinking and swaying
a railroad bridge and highway span an almost bone dry creek bed
gathered beneath the overpass are the police coroner criminialists and a local fbi
a sedan travels down a service road and stops nearby
two men exit identify themselves as fbi and move to the crime scene
special agent gordon ramsey is well groomed prides himself on professionalism and follows the bureau party line
special agent peter novak is rough around the edges introspective and intense
a loner who marches to the tune of a peculiar drummer hes unconventionally handsome with probing eyes
he moves slowly observing the scene the world for that matter from a unique perspective
as ramsey finds the fbis local liaison agent cole novak oblivious to the people around him touches dirt smells the air and examines road river bridge and sky
who found her
cole nods at a visibly shaken workman seated in a patrol car
surveyor for the railroad
bout six this morning
novak sees a female body wrapped in plastic and bound by wire
supervising the examination of the woman is fbi pathologist dr
theodore teddy lee a polite dapper southern gentleman
thanks for waiting teddy
teddy gives novak a friendly respectful salute my pleasure
novak dons gloves nods to an fbi photographer and assists teddy lee in snipping wire and peeling back thick clear plastic
as the photographer reacts to a strong smell teddy comments
as the man snaps pictures ramsey and cole join them
sadly novak recognizes the face
anne marie vicksey
we recognize her too
she the one from santa cruz
just graduated law school
had a two year old daughter
he and teddy expose the bleached flesh of her torso neither man surprised
coldly thorough novak finds another of the killers tell tale signs
instructing the photographer the semen on her legs and abdomen
photos are taken
someone looking after her little girl
live over in davis
novak looks into the dead white eyes of anne vicksey trying to imagine the horrors she beheld
he moves to the creek and sees only a few inches of water
his eyes move from the drop site to the highway above
the poor thing
were up there now on the overpass with the photographer and novak examining tire tracks in the soft shoulder
novak peers over the edge at the crime scene steps back and focuses on the highway imagining the killers truck as it disappeared into the night
a pretty young woman julia hickson shares lunch with her fiancee john tracy
they talk laugh and kiss not a care in the world
as talk radio plays carl stargher watches them specifically julia his eyes never off her for too long as his hands work on something banal but unseen
complaining about government subsidies for farmers
the voice on the radio becomes distorted as we hear it through starghers ears
but without subsidies families will starve and im nodd exagggeerrrrr
iff id werrrr up tooooo meeeee
the hosts voice fades into a guttural monstrous groan
meeeee gawwwwwdd caaaarrrrlll
mee god cum
returning to normal meeeee
be spending billions on other countries when weve got problems right here
he opens his eyes and watches john kiss julia goodbye as she returns to work
stargher looks down and we see what hes been working on a toy doll
stripped of its clothes a single metal ring stuck through its plastic neck
his lunch finished ramsey is on a cell phone talking to his wife
chain drinking coffee novak scrutinizes photos of the tire tracks
well honey whats worse
doing it yourself or asking your mother for help
gets his answer can it wait til i get back listens answers i have no idea jeannie
novak checks his watch and the street
clearly waiting for someone or something
well all right
good luck with the monster
i love you too
ramsey snaps shut the cell phone
we call jeannies mother the monster because well
she just is
novak is oblivious pouring over tire related info
i know you could care less about my personal life peter but i do appreciate the occasional hows your wife gordon
novak obliges how is she
thanks for asking
novak is distracted by teddy lee entering the diner
here he is
damn man i give up
your partner tells you his wifes gonna have a baby and all you care about is a coroners report
ramsey assesses the exhausted lonely intense man sitting across from him
i feel for those girls too pete
and their families
but its just a job
someday itll be over
and then whatll you have
much to novaks appreciation teddy lees arrival provides an escape from answering the question
hot off the presses
he gives them copies of the autopsy report and forensic analysis of anne marie vicksey
the waitress sees teddy approaches and offers a menu
doesnt need it chicken fried steak mashed potatoes garden salad with thousand island dressing and an iced tea
thank you darlin
she nods and moves to the kitchen
novak and ramsey flip through the documents
water in her lungs
same brand of bleach
match on the semen
lots of hair
unenthused more hair
i could knit this guy a toupee
novak finds something in the report that catches him by surprise
he double checks and shows the item to teddy
anne vicksey didnt own a dog
ramsey checks his copy
i need it
a monitor shows a single hair under a video microscope
teddy lee plays with the dials and gets a spectral view
complete absence of melanin
novak and ramsey stand over his shoulder
and that means
teddy moves aside and takes another bite of his lunch chicken fried steak now carry out
the dogs an albino
pictures it hed love an animal like that
gentlemen i believe an albino dog is rare indeed
exiting an elevator julia heads for her little toyota
smart girl that she is her eyes scan the area and her fingers hold a can of mace
julia climbs in checks her mirror and backs up
did she hit something
she brakes puts the car in park and checks her sideview mirror
reflected there is a wounded dog
a white german shepherd
she rolls down her window and can hear the poor thing whimpering
julia exits her car and kneels next to valentine who appears to be in terrible pain
i didnt see you
starghers hands come at her from behind
one grabs her hair and the other covers her face with a chloroform soaked towel
he presses so hard she cannot scream cannot move
after a brief struggle he shoves her into her car and holds her until she passes out
stargher pushes julia into the passenger seat and starts the car
pulls a dog treat from his pocket and whistles
the shepherd instantly perks up
and jumps into the car
feeds him a treat good boy
in a briefing room we find teddy lee ramsey cole and local cops
all in need of caffeine
they complain gossip and shoot the shit
resembling a demanding professor novak enters and through presence alone lacking any self consciousness about his dishevelled appearance takes control of the room by holding up a photograph of a
a new picture every time helen francis teresa manicki
the chatter dies
antoinette simms natalie pagels grace cassatt
every person is solemn and focused
smart gentle attractive young women
just starting out in life
embarking on careers going to school getting married
hes hooked them
the victims these women now mean something to them
with great effect he holds up grisly post mortem photos
they were killed
kidnapped tortured and murdered
by a white male
about years old
significantly who owns an albino dog
everyone knows this is a real clue and awareness is heightened
ramsey chimes in
a purebred german shepherd
novak shows them a picture of a white german shepherd taken from a resource on the internet
breeders typically destroy albino pups so this animal is truly unique
forensics found dog hair in her car but they had a k unit at the scene and never had it checked
the phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago
and we got the match
its his dog
ramsey holds up a thick list
registered breeders of german shepherds
the list is long and a few of the cops groan
novak silences them with a fierce look that says i will not rest until this man is found and neither should you
be thorough but be fast
this guys accelerating
he only waited six days this last time
when he started two months could pass
a desk seargent enters the room and hands a fax to ramsey
novak is curious about it but continues
this can mean different things
he thinks were stupid and cant catch him
hes having fun and needs more
thinking it through this dog hair thing is sloppy
the body this morning was found in less than three inches of water
he knew wed find her
he wants to be caught
but if we cant stop him
gravely concerned ramsey moves across the room
dreading whats on that fax he cant stop himself
stargher the awful pain eating away at his skull
he searches the medicine chest
me god feed on pain
the voice echoing inside his skull
cumm home to meee
struggling to stay on his feet he moves to the kitchen
valentine paces nervously whimpering concern
stargher reaches for a bottle of vodka but falls to the floor
valentine barks but gets no reaction from master
we move in on starghers unblinking eyes
go sleep carl
me god wake up now
julia hickson finds the snack foods drinking spigot toilet shower and drain
her bare feet try to adjust to the tile floor but its fucking cold
she glimpses herself in the mirror and is startled by what she sees a terrified girl
a tan sedan sits in the driveway of this modest middle class home
a ventura county sheriffs car sits nearby a deputy keeping watch
a distraught middle aged couple mr
hickson sit on the couch of their living room
family photos show them with julia whose fiancee john does his best to comfort the mother
novak and ramsey have the unfortunate task of interviewing them about their daughters disappearance
she was still living at home
we were looking at apartments
important they know but nobody was moving in together til after the wedding
novak hasnt said much
instead he looks at something in his hands a plastic evidence bag containing the toy doll
john you came to pick her up when
we were going out for my birthday
maybe you made a mistake
novak hides the doll
ramseys cell phone rings and he excuses himself to a corner of the room leaving novak alone to deal with this uncomfortable sad situation no one saying a word until
an emotionally shattered mrs
hickson fingering a rosary feels compelled to tell him
after three years she remembers what the guy drove
she remembers because it was her dream truck
wanted one just like it
ramsey and novak exit a small jet and are met by fbi agent ramsey novak
they nod and he directs them to a waiting gmc suburban
where is he
just east of loma park
swats had the house under surveillance for about twenty minutes
info memorized suspect is carl rudolph stargher
no registered weapons no priors
got a license for his dog though
named him valentine
stockwell is behind the wheel racing down the highway
ramseys in the passenger seat novak in back
shotguns and body armor line the cargo area
novaks eyes target the fax a copy of starghers license and registration and the grainy dot matrix image of the suspects face
and novak knows hes found him
youre the bad man arent you carl
a sparsely populated lower middle class neighborhood
a half dozen plain houses at the end of a cul de sac
crows in the air
the house furthest from the main road has a white ford f pick up in the driveway
the suburban hidden from starghers house four wheels it through a prairie and stops outside the backyard of a preschool where two more suburbans and a van already wait
stockwell introduces ramsey and novak to brock leader of the fbi tactical unit a calm confident ex marine wearing a black uniform and body armor
glad you could make it
we lose the sun in half an hour
novak and ramsey join him at the shaded window to observe starghers house
childrens drawings fill the wall
as brock explains novak checks with binoculars
perimeters two hundred yards around the house
three men at the rear two on each side four up front
ive got two marksmen on the roof
have they seen him
theres been movement in the kitchen
but it could be the dog
important you think shes in there
novak is careful with his answer
we proceed assuming she is
lets give old carl a call
tell him hes got company
to brock can you get a man close
and then we catch a glimpse of a figure advancing using any cover he can until he is right outside the house
the sneaky swat team member ericson whispers into his throat mic
im at the back door
in ericsons earpiece check the kitchen
ericson maneuvers his way to the kitchen window and uses a mirror to sneak a peek
in the reflection we see a motionless man lying on the floor
i have a man down
repeat man down
ericson chances a quick visual check and pops his head up before reporting
cant see his face
brock looks to novak urgency and tension mounting
novak knows how much is riding on this specific moment
all the various outcomes
the swat team swarms towards the house
he and three others rush inside
four men kick in and proceed through the front door
an odd quiet is all they encounter
in the back ericson moves through a laundry room and finds valentine hiding behind a pile of dirty clothes frightened by these masked figures in black
into throat mic ive got the dog
he points for someone to secure the animal and moves into the kitchen aiming his gun at the man on the floor finally getting a look at his face
recognizing him carl stargher
do not move
no problem there
stargher appears lifeless
as various swat team members secure the house ericson removes his mask and cuffs stargher startled at the sight of the horrible rings piercing his back
as an ambulance emerges from a hiding place behind another garage we follow novak and ramsey as they run from the preschool into the house
as a k unit secures valentine novak storms into the kitchen checks stargher for a pulse and barks at swat paramedics
ramsey pushes through and novak informs him
fbi agents and local police cordon off the area
valentine is muzzled and led away as the paramedics load stargher onto a stretcher
agent stockwell turns to a worried novak
theyll take him to county general
reids already there
make sure he stays cuffed
two men on him at all times
i dont want anyone treating him but reid
not so much as a thermometer up his ass
stockwell nods and follows the stretcher outside
a stoic ramsey enters from the living room and novak can see the disappointment in his eyes
shes not here
novak would give anything for that not to be true
it gets worse you should come downstairs
ramsey leads novak into starghers workroom
its all here the table the piercing supplies the bleach
an odd grisly collection of dolls fills cubby holes in a wooden storage shelf unit
novaks eyes are like a camera documenting and storing as much information as possible but its overwhelming
he moves through the basement
careful not to touch anything
he stops and focuses on the hoist and eight hooks situated over the stainless steel table
note on the equipment with a logo
ramsey switches on the video monitor and the screen fills with images of anne dying in the cell
novak is painfully tragically drawn to this
although hes seen his share of horrific things novak is truly disturbed by the sight of anne desperate to escape drowning slowly dying and he knows this is what will
happen to julia hickson unless he finds her
water sprays from the shower
caught by surprise julia blocks the spray with her hands and searches for a shut off valve
of course there is none
thirty seconds later the water stops
like an animal caught in a trap julias eyes dart around her cage
what kind of hell is this
shivering she catches herself in the mirror and looks deeply into it
somethings odd about the glass
is someone watching her
she bangs on it with her fist
but theres no response
only her reflection
a human eye
no movement no deviation of the iris
a fixed stare
the catatonic stargher lies in a hospital bed wrists cuffed to the frame
an iv feeds him fluids and monitors report his vital signs
as a nervous nurse exits we see two policemen standing guard in the outer hallway
novak ramsey and teddy lee stand by as the killer is examined by dr
milton reid a brilliant forensic m
currently shining an opthalmoscope into starghers eyes
he pulls away and checks the electroencenphelogram already on a lightbox
minimal activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
and here the anterior cingulate cortex
to novak and ramsey its what helps distinguish between external and internal stimuli
what the hell does that mean
answering for reid hes schizophrenic
novak doesnt like this
not one bit
whatre you doing here reid
paving the way for his insanity defense
there wont be a trial
this is no act
the coma is real
wait a minute
you ever hear of whalens infraction
re the eeg in any schizophrenic these areas would be affected
but in someone with whalens theyre hit hard and hit fast
novaks worry intensifies
starghers neurological system was infected by a virus in utero
it lay dormant
in his case for about
guesses at starghers age thirty years
most likely hes exhibited symptoms for awhile now but the infraction the breach didnt occur til today
you never know when itll happen at what age or why
the triggers vary but the results dont
fascinated by stargher he has no ties to reality
no awareness of this world or the people in it
what about thorazine
the normal psychotropics dont work
hes not just catatonic hes
like having a dream and never waking up
only he knows where she is
then im sorry
for her and for you
novak is past angry
hes bordering on devastation
ramsey attempts to placate him
well go back to his house pete
theres still a lot to do
analyze the videos track sales of the bleach go through his records
maybe he owns property somewhere
theyre in that fucking thing for forty hours gordon
he got julia at seven thirty last night
you know what time it is now
ramsey backs off knowing his partner is on the verge of really losing it
reid thinks perhaps he shouldnt but sensitive to novaks pain and anger mentions it anyway if only to keep his friend from true hopelessness
this is a longshot
i mean a real long shot
youre gonna think im crazy
the ships engine roars to life and the propeller spins through sand
at the tree trunk catherine extends her hand and suddenly edward is there quite close reaching out
catherines hand trembles
the boy is startled
surprised to herself im not signalling
her hand tenses and shakes uncontrollably
sing a song of sixpence
angry to the heavens im not signalling
edward is frightened by whats happening and runs away
catherine tries to call out but her throat constricts making speech difficult
catherines face is covered by a cloth floating down from the sky
the sky is replaced by the ceiling and overhead lights of the laboratory but miriams face remains constant
now conscious catherine finds herself in the lab at the campbell center the suspension device lowering
on intercom sing a song of sixpence
hoarse a pocketful of fucking rye
worried whats wrong
disappointed why did we stop
cooperman appears in the window and explains
on intercom i asked them to
with gravity we have a situation
a small tv screen shows footage of anne drowning in the cell
catherine cooperman henry and miriam watch with curiosity disgust pity
novak and ramsey flank the portable monitor vcr knowing this is a disturbing but powerful tool
theres someone else in the room
he cannot watch the video not again
catherine glances at him uncomfortable with his presence
when did he lapse into the coma
sometime yesterday morning
john tries to keep his composure but novaks making this tough for him
novak wants the scientists to see to understand the boys pain
each tape is the same
he provides food drinking water a toilet
periodically a shower starts
its on some kind of timer hes clever with machines building things
i think he wants them to believe this is a simple kidnapping
that theres a possibility of rescue
but its just a form of torture
at the end of the fortieth hour the drain shuts
the water starts and doesnt stop
gravely weve already lost more than a day
if she isnt found tonight
she dies like the rest
to miriam henry and catherine john and ella baines as well as the sunerset board of directors have given their approval but the decision is yours
what about the legalities of this
stargher is in custody
the functional equivalent of being under arrest
normally wed mirandize him and if he didnt lawyer up wed interrogate him
but because of his condition he doesnt have the capacity to waive those rights
so what youre asking us to do is illegal
no not at all
explains were dealing with exigent circumstances
somewhere theres a kidnapped woman still alive
if we weigh the suspects constitutional rights against the public safety
the law favors the victim and gives us a lot of leeway
its called the public safety exception
so what can you do
pretty much anything we want
theres a chance to save a human life
because of that stargher has no reasonable expectation of privacy
miriam henry and cooperman appear to be onboard
novaks made a persuasive heartfelt argument
only one person still remains uncertain
all eyes turn to her
what if he wasnt like this
what if he was normal
how far would you go
as far as i needed
catherine nods analyzes novaks eyes gestures body language and interrogates him
do you think hed tell you what you need to know
johns discomfort is increasing and novak is sensitive to it
theres always a chance theyll confess
i dont work with violent cases i work with children
but even a kid lies
they love it when they get you to believe something that isnt true
dont you think stargher would do the same
once theyve been caught they feel a need for disclosure
they have so much they want to tell
but theyve never had a sympathetic ear
they need someone to understand why
focusing on catherine stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully
it was part of the ritual
some werent found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean
but these last three
they were still in water always in water but clarifies listen he wasnt just careless
it went beyond that
lets assume he wanted you to find him that some part of him hated what he was doing
most likely that part is dead
schizophrenics with whalens infraction sever all ties with the real world
im sorry i really am
is it possible
if he came to trust me yes but it takes months to build that kind of trust
someone like stargher cant distinguish between fantasy and reality
its all the same
he might tell me shes in timbuktu and absolutely one hundred percent believe it to be true but shes
they turn to john tracy
his vulnerable barely audible voice forcing everyone to listen
not thing or it or her
do you know anything about her
do you know what weve been through
julia is everything to me
can you say that about anyone
catherine hangs her head
and finds herself looking at photograph of the girl in question
a smiling julia hickson looking right at her
whoop whoop whoop whoop
a helicopter descends onto the pad
a stretcher is removed from the side door of the helicopter
the staff watches with a mixture of fear and curiosity as a stretcher bearing the catatonic stargher is wheeled fast through the corridors by an fbi escort team
hundreds of photographs drawings diagrams maps blueprints and documents novaks case material cover every inch of wallspace
the table is littered with reference books atlases telephones a fax machine short wave radio and computer internet terminal
an fbi technician completes the electronics work and points out the speed dial functions to novak and ramsey
listing them quantico
san diego field office
and san francisco p
california arizona nevada state police
nine and ten are open lines
re radio set up direct link to the chopper
re the computer that gets you into the bureau database
once hes gone ramsey takes this moment alone to question his partner
you sure you want to go through with this
what else do we do
i dont know pete but for gods sake
this is nuts
do you really understand what theyre going to do
i dont have to
why jeopardize what weve already done
we caught the sonofabitch
thats going to be like bundy gacy dahmer
a case that makes careers
but if we push our luck
if this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it
tell you what
if this thing burns us i take that heat
i give you permission to point your finger at me and say it was all his idea
offended thats not what im talking about pete
im talking about waking up and realizing this girls gonna die
the words are anathema to novak
that wont happen
cooperman appears in the doorway and informs them
ramsey looks to his partner but novak is already on coopermans heels
resignedly ramsey follows
cooperman guides novak and ramsey into the lab
the fbi men are impressed but neither is quite sure what to make it all
the fbi escort team leader gets ramseys signature and novak undoes the cuffs from starghers wrists and ankles
following miriams direction the escorts guide the gurney carrying stargher into the procedure room
as cooperman shows them out henry seals shut the door
miriam assumes responsibility for starghers care and checks his pulse iv pupil dilation and vital signs
shouldnt we get a catheter in him
they took care of that thank you henry
getting him out of her hair why dont you give our guests a little tour
proud of his computer but uncomfortable around strangers henry directs novak and ramsey to the console
gentlemen you stand before the one and only neurological cartography and synaptic transfer system
although hes listening novaks eyes never really stray from his prisoner as miriam uses safety scissors to cut away starghers clothes
it provides a highly detailed map of the human mind
not the brain any mri can do that
self impressed it reads and processes electronically allowing information to be transferred and interrupted
for the laymen lets say your thoughts could be stored on dvd
if someone had the right kind of player they could watch and listen to what youre thinking
novak observes miriam as she undresses stargher and ramsey pokes around the lab
but we cant record or store the data
the connections between nerve cells are constantly being modified
miriam needs a moment to fully take in the scars
henry continues eager to focus attention back to him but even he is fascinated by starghers skin
its like the early days of television
the subject sends out a live feed and you receive it during time of broadcast
whatever happens happens
all you have to do is tune in
miriam gives stargher an alcohol bath the clinical procedure taking on the quality of ritual
her wash cloth moves under starghers chin and over his face
shes careful around the eyes and finds herself unable to look at them for long
but you do more than tune in
you become part of the snow
catherine enters from a dressing area wearing the bodysuit
filled with curiosity novak watches miriam and catherine fit stargher into his suit
i still dont understand why i cant do this
this isnt some troubled kid youre dealing with
i realize that
how hard could it be
catherine and miriam try to hide their laughter
six or seven times i went in
remember what happened
disorientation nausea migraines hallucinations insomnia paranoia
like a new years day hangover
he needs to be turned over
novak and catherine roll stargher onto his stomach
this man is deeply disturbed he
you dont know the procedure
i know him
that may be true but you dont have catherines gift
distracted by starghers back what happened here
we see a series of eight bandages
we removed eight metal rings
miriam peels away a bandage and examines the flesh
then he should like this
catherine connects stargher to the suspension apparatus and it hoists him off the table
theyre comforted by the feeling of weightlessness
like floating in water
henry catches ramsey poking his nose near a third suit and apparatus in the dressing area
dont touch that please
miriam prepares a series of chemical cartridges and loads them into a container connected to the iv like tubes linked to the suspension device
intimate quiet this isnt your responsibility
dont let them use guilt as a tool
if you want to stop say so
ill be fine
she said convincingly
catherine focuses on the procedure and makes the necessary connections
reluctantly miriam retreats to the monitoring station
she locks down the procedure room and joins henry novak and ramsey at the console
eyes on the chemical drug monitors thats the stuff
about twelve years of research right miriam
dont remind me
what is it are they exactly
thats like asking her to explain the rules of cricket
psychostimulants serotonin stabilizers meprobamate neurontin lithium carbonate
and my baby
it duplicates and expands upon the effects of a chemical called oxytocin forcing a break in the neuron connections that hold experience
so new experience can form
ramsey is utterly lost and just sort of nods but novak is fascinated
catherine presses the bump on her hand
a red indicator light flashes on
theres a touch sensitive microchip implanted in her hand
if she becomes frightened disoriented or simply wants to end the session she signals us to abort
catherine presses again and the red light shuts off
although none of what she experiences is real she can be tricked into thinking it is
the mind is awfully gullible so she needs to monitor herself
catherine and stargher are suspended from the ceiling
henry types and the lights dim to a more somber tranquil level
various screens flicker to life displaying the vital signs of both feed and receive
miriam initiates the injection program
im about to start
if you want me to wait or
in the procedure room we see chemicals mix with her blood then feed the iv
at the console as henry types furiously at the computer keyboard novak asks miriam you said she has a gift
overhearing henry interrupts pointing at a section of catherines mind map
not a gift
a highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex thats all
a genetic fluke
catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy
clarifies when we started there were a number of test subjects other therapists who acted as receivers
all they did was observe and report
but catherine she had the ability to feel what was happening
and the patient responded
edward engaged her in dialogue took her places showed her things
he knew she cared
a hopeful solemn novak gazes through the window watching catherines body as it becomes parallel to starghers
in the procedure room catherine takes a deep breath and as the drugs take effect feels herself losing consciousness
she glances at stargher a man who tortures and kills women then looks up as the cloth mask descends from the ceiling
intravenous administration complete
we follow fibrous wires running from catherines mask to starghers
their blood mixing with chemicals in the iv like containers
the computer system humming
transfer begins hours minutes seconds
catherines eye focuses on the mask
as it comes closer we see the lining is laced with thread like wires and microchips forming hyper miniature circuit boards
catherines eye blinks
the mask covers her face
catherines eye shuts
a faint light
microscopic veins in the eyelid become wires connected to chips
and were moving into the circuitry
the pattern of the electronics grows into something more organic textured concrete
evolving into a world
black and shadow filled it resembles a labyrinthine complex of vertical walls with cubicle like rooms carved deep into its core
our journey into this bleak grim place continues and we occasionally glimpse brief images of a boys baptism
intercut with this journey are sections of cloudy blackness and fragmented visions of catherine connected to the apparatus face masked descending into this world
there is an abrupt shift from still images to regular motion and we find ourselves gliding over a tidepool filled with tiny fish and tadpoles
at waters edge lying on rough pebble strewn ground is a hand
we sense movement but she remains still
from the darkness comes a dog
black in color and featureless it sniffs catherine dismisses her and meanders into a cubicle opposite her disappearing from view
after a moment of odd quiet a drop of blood hits the mask and we follow catherines hand as it moves to the cloth and removes it from her own
in macroscopic super slow motions another blood droplet sails into the air and comes crashing down hitting a red ant catapulting it onto what looks like a tree but is
just a twig
as the insect scurries away more drops pound the earth splatter against twig trees and explode into pools of stagnant water
as we begin to realize that this miniature landscape is the world into which catherine descended
she sits up shivering and breathes deeply acclimating to her surroundings
the floor is covered with filth ash pebbles and insects
water is present in many forms puddles moisture dripping ceilings
eyes focusing queasy not fully awake catherine notices the crimson stain on the cloth mask and the blood droplets showering the air
she turns and finds the source
the black dog stands in the opposite room next to a tub full of blood shaking himself dry after his bath
satisfied the animal stops and trots away
still adjusting to this nightmarish realm catherine at first doesnt hear it but then realizes that somewhere a child is crying
she looks around then through a crack in the floor briefly catches sight of a boy beneath her on a level lower than hers
as he disappears into corridor ending in nothing we pull back to show a massive landscape of blocks cubicles crawlspace walls stairs and ladders
leading everywhere and nowhere
catherine spots the boy as he crawls into a specific room
shortly after a light comes on within the cubicle and she moves to it
we feel as though were looking at a series of interlocked tenement rooms some walls of which have been torn away to expose rooms within rooms with no windows or
following a path of fragile steps catherine makes her way to the lighted room and enters
a mottled horse stands with its head down nose kissing the floor allowing the boy to caress its neck
this sweet animal is an incrongruous vision in this hellish world and catherine approaches with respect
the frightened child retreats into a corner of the claustrophobic room but the horse does not startle
surprisingly to the boy the horse takes an affectionate step toward catherine inviting her to take over
catherine allows the mare to smell her then vigorously scratches along the mane and shoulder much to the horses delight
yeah you like that dont you
she can see the boy hiding in the corner stealing glances at her from the shadows
is your name carl
the boy young stargher is startled and intrigued by the question how did she know that
but says nothing
another little boy i know he has a horse too
the boy reacts to an unusual sound coming from the ceiling
his names edward
the boy not the horse
the boy takes a few steps toward her out of the shadows but he seems more concerned about something in the ceiling than connecting with catherine
very anxiously he looks at the wall behind catherine and watches an old wind up kitchen timer click down
whats the matter carl
again a sharp sound from the ceiling
young stargher runs at her and shoves her hard
catherine falls back just as eight sheets of glass drop from the ceiling
like oversize razor blades they slice the horse into four clean sections
they separate and compact the quadrants until four glass contained sections of dissected horse stand within the room
catherine screams but the mare barely acknowledged what happened
betraying no emotion the boy runs
the shaken catherine takes a moment to collect herself then gives chase
young stargher knows his way around the landscape but catherine has difficulty simply keeping him in sight
she runs climbs and crawls
until shes utterly lost and disoriented
tired and having difficulty breathing she drops to her knees and cools down
she hears a noise nearby gets to her feet and finds a geared mechanism connected to some kind of shuttered door composed of an almost metallic looking glass
curious yet cautious she examines the nearby walls floor and ceiling for any signs of traps akin to the glass blades
finding none she pulls the mechanism and quickly steps back
the shutter opens and catherine knows theres something alive in the tiny cubicle beyond
she retreats into shadow hiding
released from the chamber is a woman
as she moves out of a darkness we see victim one
ghostly pale and adorned in eerie fetish garb she appears to sense the presence of a stranger targets catherine in the shadows and attacks
catherines had enough and moves to press the implant but she brutally grabs catherine throws her against the wall and smacks her head against it
catherine drops to the floor like a rag doll
victim one hefts catherine onto her shoulder and with great purpose carries her deep into the labyrinth toward the core
passing in and out of consciousness between darkness and light a dazed catherine is taken on a tour of starghers world
passing mausoleum like chambers filled with images of unspeakable horror and or disturbing intensity
at one of the rooms we think we see young stargher silently observing
sitting of standing in individual cubicles are starghers other victims two thru six each woman resembling the grotesque porcelain dolls glimpsed in the cubbyholes in starghers basement
dressed by a fetishistic sadist nine inch nails meets the brides of dracula they resemble bored housewives barely acknowledging the new member of the harem
victim one drops catherine in the center of the room and job done crawls away
groggy feeling sick catherine sits up
unbeknownst to her she is sitting at the base of a pedestal with her back to the kind of throne
and someone is there
in the dim pool of light above the pedestal we see a man rise from the throne
the wall behind him is covered in blood red cloth and as he descends we realize it is a cape connected to eight metal rings pierced through the flesh of
in a fluid motion waves of red give way to harshly textured concrete as the man reaches the floor
catherine knows he is there
unable to stop herself she turns
and sees the terrifying face of stargher
but no the same stargher
this is stargher king
primitive guttural where you come from priddy thing
in a split second catherine presses the implant on her hand
apparently capable of staying awake if properly caffeinated novak sits cross legged on the floor shoes off analyzing recent photos and documents sent to him via courier
ignoring a snoring ramsey napping on a nearby cot novak looks at blow ups from the videos blueprints of starghers house detailed shots of the basement and a draftsmans conceptual
drawing of the cell itself
novak looks at an intercom speaker
novak doesnt wait for his just stirring partner and moves
as he enters novak sees a concerned henry checking a print out of the procedure
mustve been rather unusual
noting novaks confusion henry points to a central monitor resembling a futuristic v
meter gradiated in sections of white yellow orange and red
re white yellow area if her neural activity stays within this range i know shes self cognitive
clarifies as if she were having a dream but she knows shes dreaming
she can wake up any time she wants to
as ramsey joins them novak nods understanding but his eyes are on catherine whos just coming back to consciousness
re orange section however if her level of involvement is rather intense as it was just now she can perceive things as true
its difficult to keep perspective
as novak lingers on that question ramsey gestures at the red section
what happens here
we dont talk about that
well theoretically while shes inside
if she came to believe that starghers world is her world her mind has the power to convince the body that anything done to it is um actually done
novak doesnt like the sound of that
thats why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely
we dont want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation
pump in two liters of pure oxygen please henry
henry types a command and novak speaks into the intercom
in the procedure room miriam eases catherine back to consciousness
when she sees stargher catherines flesh crawls
is it cold in here
incapable of being in the same room as him catherine tears out of the apparatus and anxiously exits
ill get her
a worried novak searches the halls of the campbell center
hes about to ask the staff for help but stops when he sees through the window to edwards room
catherine sits next to the boys bed holding edwards hand softly singing a lullaby to him to herself
feeling that he must speak to her novak intervenes
edward baines i presume
to the catatonic child hi ed
do you think thats funny
not at all
from what i understand he knows i m here isnt that right
novak picks up edwards fallen teddy bear and rests it in the crook of the childs arm
i read about a woman in texas who was in a coma for seven years
every time her husband came to visit her heart would beat faster
isnt that something
i dont know what name scientists have for something like that
it doesnt have much to do with science
whatever you want to call it
ah the part of us that cant be explained
she appreciates his understanding
and finds herself comforted by his presence
catherine scrutinizes novak his intensity his honesty his complexity
and asks agent novak
do you feel theres a side of yourself you dont show people
the question catches novak off guard but hes willing to answer
anything to get her talking
realizing its too personal i suppose everyone does
just like we all have fantasies right
things only we know that we dont share
thats what therapists are for right
it helps her relax
if only slightly
during the sessions
when im inside
i see those things
what a person hides what they despite what they want to control
this is difficult for her
with stargher i saw things
what did you see
professionally a kingdom
life without consequence or restriction
hes not even carl stargher anymore
idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases
a horrible primitive ugly thing
uncomfortable re edward i dont want to talk in here
she kisses edwards forehead and exits
catherine and novak sit on a bench in the center of the courtyard
john tracy is visible in the reception area unable to sleep desperately trying to fight frustration
whyd you bring him here
youre the shrink you tell me
already knows as soon as i met him you knew id say yes
he makes julia real for me
its an old lawyer trick
target the emotions
do it right you get a reluctant witness to testify a scared kid to confess
catherine looks at him with disbelief
before i was with the bureau i was an attorney a prosecutor
law and order
i had a murder case in north carolina
butchered seventeen people in three days
and because of one tiny piece of tainted evidence he walked
no regrets thats when i quit the das office and joined the fbi
catherine can see the pain and frustration in novaks eyes
she gives him a moment and asks you thought stargher wanted to be caught
i did yeah
you were right
theres a part of him that knows the truth
about what he did about himself
novaks curiosity is piqued
what about julia
this is going to sound terrible but
i dont think she matters anymore
not to him
he never finished her
he was able to make them his
you think you can do this dont you
he might tell me about julia
the part of him that wants to help that feels shame and remorse
who wants to be redeemed
skeptically this is stargher were talking about
not stargher not really
hes split himself right down the middle
good evil right wrong merciful cruel
and an innocent child
if i could reach the boy
arent they the same guy
dont you feel there are different sides to every personality
maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act
were all human
its hard for me to see stargher as human capable of something like remorse
then what is he
if you believe that
maybe this is a big fucking waste of time
sensing something what happened to charles gish
novak doesnt respond
she prods him
what difference does it make
god he does not want to do this
right after the trial the night after he was released
frank simmons found charlie sitting in their living room watching tv with their twelve year old daughter margaret
hed cut her right down the middle with a carving knife
found the girls heart in the freezer he thought they might want to keep it
grim humor luckily the next thing he did was slit his own throat
bleakly i am convinced of one thing
charles gish couldve been raised by ozzie and harriet and the same thing wouldve happened
he can see catherine doesnt accept that
a child can experience abuse worse than charlies
and grow up to be someone who would never ever hurt another living thing
youre sure of that
catherine realizes that was a confession
where the hell you been
they turn to see ramsey
next time tell me okay
but you looked so cute
ramsey shoots him a murderous look then asks catherine
your colleagues want to know what to do with stargher
novak looks to catherine for the answer
through the window blinds she watches john tracy lower his head
tell them to prep him
and that ill be right there
ramsey nods and heads back to the lab
briefly he touches her hand
catherine looks away from john to novaks hand to the photographs on the wall
starghers house valentine the pick up truck
i need something
a k unit fbi agent escorts valentine to the lab
as the agent brings the frightened animal into the monitoring area catherine and valentine share a moment of connection
slowly confidently she approaches the shepherd kneels and removes his leash and muzzle
she strokes him and the dog instantly warms up to her
sure wasnt like that with me
novak signs a document and the k agent exits
youre a good boy arent you valentine
the dog picks up a scent from the procedure room and moves it catherine and novak following
in the procedure room stargher lies face down on a gurney
now taped to the wall near stargher are pictures from the basement his dolls the hoist etc
miriam in surgical mask and gloves carefully re inserts the metal rings taken from an fbi evidence bag into the eight straps of flesh on his back
when he sees this valentine whimpers and hides
catherine comforts him
miriam finishes her task and removes her mask
i hate to admit it but theres something perversely satisfying about this
i think thats the whole point
valentine runs to his sleeping master and barks at catherine as if asking for help
she encourages the animal to lick and sniff starghers face and hands
in the control room he scrutinizes the monitor showing the detailed map of starghers brain
increased neural activity in the frontal lobes
rising dopamine levels in the basal ganglia
ever since the dog walked in
in the procedure room catherine readies herself in the receive apparatus
as stargher is lifted off the pedestal the doors hiss shut and valentine curls up on the floor beneath his master
as catherine is lifted she smiles at the animal then looks to stargher
comforting and coaching her remember julia hickson is priority number one
nothing else matters
find out where she is
catherines eyes shut
fade to black
we hear an electrical hum rise and fall
catherine opens her eyes and the lights blink on and off in a weird pattern making it difficult to see clearly
dont kid around henry
her suspension apparatus descends on the floor
its a power problem
i need you to go to the circuit breaker and check switches six through twelve
catherine moves toward the electrical panel
try to stay awake okay
yeah yeah yeah
im not sleepy
as she moves toward the panel everything becomes larger
by the time catherine reaches the circuit breaker it is the size of a garage door
curiouser and curiouser
she turns around to see the laboratory is empty and dead quiet
and she sees herself catherine as small as a mouse trapped in a giant walled space
at the console novak miriam and henry observe the procedure room
suspended in the apparatus
catherine turns to see
catherine lying in the fetal position locked in a box made of thick clean glass
the electronic hum becomes rhythmic ambient noise
inside the box staying calm she searches for and finds a trap door on the floor
she pushes out
the camera executes a complete degree perspective change
she tries to reach out to stop her descent but cannot
catherine falls through a dark cavernous room resembling a mammoth hollowed out rib cage
below her is a dome like structure growing out of the floor a hole in the center of its crest
dozens of other such domes are visible in the murky hell hole but catherine has no choice
shes dropping into this one
once she passes through the hole inside the dome catherines body looks as though its moving through water but there is no water
like an aerial artist she reverses her position so shes heads up
standing stable on the floor
sensing something with her
and knows it is
out from the darkness moving in normal motion comes the white german shepherd but in the thick haze his face is indistinct and ghostly
and as she steps toward him his face dissolves into a stark landscape
an ear becomes a hill the nose a stone mouth a path and the eye a house
young stargher retreats towards the bleak structure as catherine enters frame
seeing the invitation she presses on
young stargher is at the sink washing dishes an anxious eye on the clock
need some help
as catherine enters the claustrophobic house the boy hesitantly pushes a towel toward her but doesnt look
she reaches the counter and starts to dry much to young starghers relief
as he washes catherine hands him a mirror locket just like edwards
carl i want to give you a present
hes hypnotized by the thing his eyes lighting up
if you need me or if you feel that im around but cant find me just shine it like this
she shines reflected light onto the walls
carl hands catherine the wet plate and takes the locket
the dish slips from her fingers and shatters on the floor
the boys eyes fill with dread
the kitchen clock reads
he pushes catherine toward a broom closet and shoves her inside
whats wrong honey
with a finger to his lips he pockets the locket and shuts the door
from within the closet she watches the terrified child through a crack in the door
in the kitchen young stargher desperately tries to hide the broken plate
startlingly his father martin stargher is already in the room
cruel imposing manipulative man
what did you do know
you make a mess
i hate a mess
young stargher backs into a corner fearing what will come
dont lie now carl
in the closet catherine pushes but the door wont budge
in the kitchen we hear no sound
remember what i said about liars
liars will be punished
catherine hears the child scream
but the scream comes from behind and she spins around
young stargher is forced to sit on the lap of an ugly middle aged woman barely wearing a mans robe
on a nearby table are whisky tumblers and an ashtray filled with butts
i got you a present cutie pie
she gives him a toy doll
drunk she hugs and kisses him
embarrassed the boy tries to squirm away
youre not going anywhere
martin enters and sneers at the boy
go back to bed worm
its okay we was just
shut up cunt
the woman cowers familiar with his violent moods
the boy hurries to his room but martin grabs him by the collar
what is that
he pulls the doll from the childs hands turns to the woman and smacks her across the face with it gashing her cheek
you give him nothing
are you his mother
terrified she shakes her head no
martin sees young stargher quietly crawling away hoping to escape
martin lifts the boy off the floor with one hand and holds him in front of the woman
you see that
you slithered out one of them
but where is she now carl
as far from you as she could get thats where
shoves him at the woman you want a mommy
is that what you want
the poor boy trembles with fear
and martin notices a puddle of urine on the floor
he drops the boy and laughs
little worm pissed his pants
humiliated carl covers himself and hides in a corner
martin and the woman laugh and laugh delighting in the boys humiliation
feeling the boys shame catherine turns and finds a faded postcard taped to the wall
martin has discovered his sons secret hiding place a camouflaged corner of the attic
arranged in deliberate artistic fashion are scavenged dolls
heads limbs and torsos held together with twine tape and wire
some wrapped in filthy plastic
faded photographs including one of his mother mementos and most disturbingly the feathers and bones of dead birds insect carcasses and dissected desiccated mice
theres something peculiarly beautiful here but martin doesnt see it
not at all
only girls play with dolls
he turns and we see carl is bound to a wooden support beam a piece of tape covering his mouth
the boy is stripped to the waste barely conscious face streaked with tears and sweat
what kind of thing are you
a weird noise snaps catherine back to reality
she turns just as a door opens behind her
responding to the invitation she moves through it
the adult carl stargher sits at the edge of the tub his back to us smoking a cigarette
a white german shepherd puppy clicks across the tile floor and yips at catherine
she again hears the weird noise
a stainless steel bowl wobbles as starghers bloody rubber gloved hands fill it with something
stargher knows shes there and isnt surprised by her presence but hes not sure what to make of her
what to do with her
he rises and walks past her to the sink
he pulls off the gloves and washes his hands glancing at her in the mirror
catherine cannot resist looking in the tub
she sees a dead girl her torso sliced open
disgusted and mortified she pulls back
she was the first
she turns and stargher is no longer at the sink
didnt know what i was doing
she turns wheres this voice coming from
she steps back
the bumps into the stainless steel bowl and it topples to the floor spilling its contents of human organs
wobble wobble wobble
the bowl makes its now familiar noise
what did you do now
you make a mess
and she can see him coming out of the shadows
catherine backs into a corner fearing what will come
i hate a mess
stargher steps into a pool of light shooshes the puppy into the hall shuts the bathroom door and looks right at catherine
why are you here
god almighty what does she say
what does she tell him
dont lie now
scritch scritch scritch
the puppy scratches at the door and whimpers but starghers not about to let him back in
moving slowly carefully he approaches catherine
liars will be punished
catherine makes a break for the door
playfully stargher makes a half hearted attempt to block her but she evades him and reaches for the knob
but the doors not there
scritch scritch scritch
she can still hear the dog but theres no damn door
she turns no door
the girls body and bloody remains have vanished
an overhead light flickers on giving the room the look and feel of the cell
where do you think youre going
catherine turns back to the wall calm and intimidating stargher stands in the center regarding her with great curiosity
catherines ready to press the sensor
dont do that
if you go away youll never find her
how did he know
if you never find her she dies
like the rest
catherine stops and listens
she cant leave now
the path to julia has appeared
i mean thats why youre here right
why you came to my happy little home
he reaches for her and she flinches
expecting such behavior stargher grins
a pretty pretty thing
catherine cannot show her fear not now
she composes herself and approaches him
i want to help you carl
his grin broadens to a smile and he almost laughs
thats a good one
catherine stands her ground
you sound like your father
he gets close to her face and sneers
i am not like him
stargher retreats into the shadows but catherine persists
then help me
where is julia hickson
maybe because you want to
is that right
you think you know me
henry sees a rapid rise in catherines warning meter
a wave of fear of impending doom overtakes catherine
you wanna know who i am
you stupid bitch
and when he emerges from shadow stargher is stargher king
now shud you mouth priddy thing or me god slice you from the kunt to the tits
catherine moves to touch the sensor in her hand
he grabs lifts and slams her onto the floor the back of her head hitting hard
her vision blurs
ears are ringing
me god want you stay
stargher king straddles catherine and pins her arms behind her back
shes unable to touch the sensor
with the tip of the tool he traces a line from her pelvis up the center of her suit
me god mek you beaudiful
he shoves the tool through her neck and presses the trigger
a collar clamps shut around catherines neck and
she blacks out
a sensor alarm sounds on the computer
henry and miriam express shock at the sight of the monitor peaking in the red and move to the map of catherines mind
as it becomes cool starghers becomes hot
son of a bitch
in the procedure room valentine barks
the dog growls and backs away
as if he senses something horribly wrong within his master
in the control room novak questions the scientists
when we got here you just topped and pulled her out
that was with edward
shes accustomed to his world
starghers mind is unfamiliar territory
looks at the third suit someone has to go in
remind her whats really happening
and get her out
until then shes at his mercy
novaks mind reels
novak knows who that person will be
fueling herself with candy and juice julia examines the cell for a way out but finds tight seals everywhere
the shower erupts with water
she counts until thirty it stops
shivering julia stars at the drain as the water spirals down
trying to remember the words our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name
thy kingdom come thy will be done
on the other side of the glass we watch her through one way glass from the video cameras point of view
she looks right at us in the mirror saddened by the dark circles under her bloodshot eyes
on earth as it is in heaven
we drift to the right and see the l
counters clicking away
less than two hours to live and she has no idea
in the procedure room novak lies in a hastily rigged third apparatus suspension device
miriam connects him to the iv cylinder and tubes
i have done this you know
miriam nods knowing he wont accept an opposing argument
instructs him deep breaths
in the observation room henry adjusts monitors showing novaks vital signs
pulse is rapid pressures a little high
in the procedure room miriam asks nervous
she loads a microchip sensor into a high pressure injection gun and implants it in novaks hand
he winces from the brief pain as she loads the chemical cartridges
i have to ask you some things
are you taking any prescription drugs
for my stomach
any psychiatric medication
what about narcotics
i know your partners here but its very important that youre honest
im a pretty boring guy
i doubt that
henry checks the maps catherines vitals and reports
we should hurry
miriam walks novak through whats about to happen
the first five minutes will be disorienting
give yourself time
let the drugs do the work
if you can see smell feel hear taste things youre on the right track
once youve acclimated try to get a feeling for catherine
instinct plays a huge role in this
she gives him a supportive touch on the shoulder exits and shuts the door
in the observation room miriam continues via intercom
you can control how you see yourself clothes shoes that kind of thing but the rest of it is up to him
use only what he provides
dont try to change anything
or introduce something of your own
itll only upset him
in the procedure room novak flexes his fingers and sees the little bump beneath his flesh
press the sensor
novak does and the red light comes on
as novak is lifted he looks at catherine then stargher
valentine yips and settles beneath novak
the suspension device clicks into place and the mask descends
no matter what happens peter remember one thing its not real
novaks eyes fix on the clear liquid contained in the iv like cylinder
a liquid cloud of his blood grows within
preparing the mixture for injection
the viscosity of the fluid starts to thicken and the camera moves into the mixture
as blood and chemical swirls take shape we move fast
deeper into the fluid at a molecular level
we feel like were soaring over some kind of liquid landscape
hes having difficulty making the transition
flying faster faster faster
through an entire universe
novak is in the procedure room
his face contorted as if feeling the effects of tremendous g force
clouds hover above a dark gloomy landscape dotted with hills
three identical women sit on black earth their bodies positioned in a uniform pattern
pull back to reveal novak at their feet in a kneeling fetal position face down in the gritty soil a piece of cloth draped over his head
with difficulty practically inhaling black grit novak breathes deeply and rises to his knees
his hand moves to his face and hes briefly astounded by the texture of the gravel the sharpness of it against his face
removing the shroud like cloth he looks at the soil smells it tastes it
have you seen him
novak finds the first of the three visions of starghers mother addressing him
she like the other two speaks in a ghostly monotone nearly devoid of emotion
my boy my little one
his father took him from me
have you seen him
as she continues almost mantra like woman two begins similar monotone my child is an abomination
he is damned
he has no soul
the womens repetitive monologues overlap
aurual layers now added by three
me god me boy
me god good son
novak takes a moment to absorb his surroundings
the sights sounds and feel of the place
like being within a dream
as he backs away from the odd quartet shimmering light dances across his face
shading his eyes
novak searches for the source
opposite him across the valley is a sheer rock wall
a massive cliff face pockmarked with rough windows
like a star the light sparkles inside one of them a fragment of mirror reflecting a beam away from novaks face to a path cutting across the valley floor to
the base of the wall
the light guiding him novak follows the path and starts to climb finding stairs or ladders passing deep seemingly infinite passages
like tombs or the drawers of a mausoleum
deep within one of them the light flickers
and novak crawls into darkness
novak emerges in a cavernous room dripping with decadence
the place reeks of sex pain lust and cruelty
as he moves deeper into the chamber novak sees young stargher perched atop some kind of pedestal crouching fingering his mirror locket bouncing sparkles of light into the dark corners
of the room the flickering light pinpoints a figure emerging from the darkness
it is catherine
altered to an image of starghers victims
her skin face clothing eyes are just like the victims
its a shocking strange image made even more disturbing by the look of pleasure on her face
novak is staggered by the sight
his vision and hearing become affected by blurred vision sharp sounds then focus to clarity as he reminds himself
like an ethereal queen of the damned she strides toward him narrowing her eyes
she exhibits no recognition of her name
catherine seductively moves closer to novak their bodies almost touching her hands caressing his hair lips neck
listen to me
she presses her finger to his lips and forces him down onto the floor his back to the pedestal
catherine straddles novak and when he tries to stand she holds him down forcing him to stay
she steals a glance over his shoulder and glimpses a male figure coming toward them coming into the light
novak is utterly unaware of whats happening
catherine is keeping him occupied
waiting for the arrival of
novak catches only a fleeting glimpse of the monster before stargher king grabs him by the throat and smashes his head against a pedestal
eyelids rise and flutter
novak becomes conscious
and instantly realizes whats happened
he lies on the pedestal face up spread eagle his wrists and ankles bound to the cold stone surface with leathery cords
standing over him in a pool of light is stargher king
wearing what could be seen as ceremonial garb a silent solemn stargher king prepares himself for execution of a ritual by polishing and arranging an assortment of shiny sharp macabre
novak shuts his eyes and silently tells himself not real
he opens them breathes deeply and focuses on catherine
youre catherine young
you majored in psych at uc san diego
you work for sunerset industries
stargher kings fingers pass over an array of horrific instruments the throat piercer collar mechanism a cleaver knife a misshapen hammer a long slender needle
your grandmother raised you after your parents died in a car crash
stargher king lifts the blade like needle
so far catherine looks at novak like hes speaking gibberish
when you were twenty one you were arrested for possession and got off with community service
stargher king slices through novaks clothes exposing the flesh of his abdomen
reminding himself not real pete
this is not real
urgency you had to work at a center for abused kids for three months
you stayed on two years for no pay
you give half your fucking salary to the nursing home your grandmother stays at
stargher king grabs his throat and traces the blade down the center of novaks torso
novak struggles and pleads with catherine
i know this because i work for the fbi
peter novak remember
a desperate request remember
you are cath stargher king cuts his flesh and inserts the needle into his stomach
this fucking hurts
stargher king wiggles the needle pulls it out and digs his finger into the wound
novak cries in pain
tears forming horrified fucking feels real
the intensity of novaks cries hit catherine like a thunderbolt
theres a glimmer of life of recognition in her eyes
finally speaking me god gut you like a dear
although we dont see it we hear something awful
like stargher king fishing around inside the wound
a pale sweating novak tries to stay conscious
he will not go into shock
a female hand grabs the tool from the tray
mimicking novak laughing nod reel nod reel nod reel
thing through his throat
as stargher king stumbles away gagging blood pouring form his neck we see that she has returned to normal
the bride persona is gone
as stargher king emits animalistic growls catherine turns and sees an intact novak standing next to her
as if nothing had happened
catherine and novak run out of the den into the tunnel from which novak gained access
he stops ready to press the sensor when a flicker of light dances across catherines face
like hell wait
but she wont listen and hes forced to play catch up as she moves further from the den toward the cliff face
the flicker of light shines on the entrance to a specific tunnel
he wants us to follow
the little boy
he brought you to me didnt he
if you want julia to live trust me
on her hands and knees she enters the tunnel not waiting for him to respond
she knows what hell do
catherine and novak crawl through the dark grimy claustrophobic space playing with his mirror locket
he so desperately wants her affection but fear prevents him from reaching out to her
this is peter
scared he shakes his head no
dont be scared
youre my friend and i would never hurt you
she extends her hand
oh so hesitantly he takes it
will you take us to her
shyly hesitantly he nods
she smiles gratefully and affectionately touches the boys face
clasping her hand young stargher leads catherine and novak into utter darkness
more stylized than the actual cell its bigger and ornately decorated with the atmosphere of a church
individual images hang like shrines each showing julia hickson from different angles
central to the room is a window into the cell itself
where we find a beautiful mermaid like julia hickson floating in water
in the center of the room we find novak and catherine she holding the hand of young stargher he stunned at the sight of julia
the child looks at catherine with beatific sad eyes regarding her as one would a saviour
where the hell are we
carl do you know
like on a map
he shakes his head and buries his face in her shoulder
its okay its okay
you helped so much already
im proud of you
as a frustrated novak searches for anything identifying catherine comforts the boy and looks deeply into his sad haunted eyes
carl i think i can help you
would you like that
even if peter cant find julia i want to help you
the boy leans against her and she caresses his face
novak finds himself standing in front of the idealized cell
mounted beneath the glass is a shiny perfect metal plaque reading carver industrial equipment with a logo
novak recognizes it from the hoist in starghers basement
he pulls her to her feet
feeling betrayed and rejected the child breaks away from her
the roar of stargher king shakes the cell
terrified the boy searches for a place to hide
novak feels whats coming
i cant leave him
stargher king appears
his throat wounded bloody mess he descends out of dark nothingness howling with rage
he reaches for catherine but young stargher runs in front of her
little carl opens his mouth in a silent scream
catherines arms reach out to him but novak clasps her hand and presses
and she is haunted by the sight of a frightened child in the arms of a monster
henry notices significant activity on the monitors
everything happens fast
he and miriam frantically cease the procedure
novak and catherine are lowered and novak startles them by quickly regaining consciousness
miriam attempts to inject him with stabilizing drugs but hes already trying to tear himself out of the apparatus
get me out
miriam moves into the procedure room
miriam tries to follow protocol but novak is moving like a fish caught in a net ripping and tearing his way out of the apparatus and suit
he gets to his feet but soon falls to his knees dizzy and disoriented
novak is not listening
fighting off any after effects both physical and mental he moves for the door
catherine is coming back and miriam moves to her
novak pauses just for a moment
is she alright
but youre going to sit down right now
i have to
novak is already gone
novak speed dials a number on speaker phone hurriedly dresses and locates a photograph of starghers basement
when he hears someone pick up the line he barks this is novak whove i got
a confused ramsey enters and listens
a team of fbi agents is meticulously going through every inch of starghers house
crisscrossed wooden beams have been laid across the pit allowing forensics experts to search without disturbing anything
on the other end of the direct line is cole
i need you to find something in the basement
that hoist with the winch
we follow cole as he moves to the machine
theres some kind of plaque a metal plate with a logo
on the base
cole locates it
reading carver industrial equipment
novak instructs him
find out the history of that machine
who bought it used it sold it
and check starghers pay stubs
i want to know every contractor he worked for
im calling you from the chopper in ten minutes
dizziness and disorientation again hit novak
pale and sweating he winces as his stomach agonizingly cramps
jesus christ man you look like hell
considering where ive been
fighting the pain he gathers together maps slips on his shoes and grabs gun and holster
ramsey is apoplectic
whoa whoa whoa
mind telling me what the fuck is happening
novak points to the photo of starghers basement specifically the hoist
youre bettin the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows what kind of shit
i saw her
i saw everything
you mightve seen jimmy hoffa dancing with timothy leary
i dont care
novak is not stopping
in the procedure room miriam shines the penlight into catherines eyes
a pocketful of rye
four and twenty blackbirds
baked in a pie
at the console on a security monitor henry can see novak and ramsey exiting down the corridor
the fbi has left the building
in the procedure room miriam appears concerned
i didnt get a chance to clear him
catherine encourages her
as miriam hurries to catch novak she tells henry
keep an eye on her
he nods but isnt really paying attention
catherine turns to starghers motionless form still suspended still connected to the machinery
do something julia
she looks around the room and runs her hands along the walls the tile looking for a weak spot
she focuses on the ceiling panel and although its painful because of swollen fingers removes her engagement ring
a ready and waiting helicopter is on the pad
novak races out of the center ramsey right behind him shouting at each other in order to hear above the chopper noise
pete listen to me
what did you really learn in there
you really think stargher gave you a save the day clue
what if this is all some kind of trick your head is playing on you
he wont consider that
novak climbs into the helicopter and buckles himself in
he looks to ramsey you coming
ramsey pats the side of the chopper and signals for the pilot to take off
henry analyzes voluminous print outs from the last procedure
although his eyes are on the data he converses with catherine in the procedure room via intercom
there was a moment when we thought wed lost agent novak as well
we see chemicals flow and computer programs initiate the procedure but henry is oblivious
his post procedure consciousness recovery was remarkably quick
never saw that before
hey remember that one time
he jumps when the door to the procedure room seals shut and mechanisms hum
when he looks through the window catherine is again suspended the procedure under way
what are you doing
he types in a command but nothing happens
he tires again
on another keyboard but gets no response
when he looks at the map screens he sees something odd
its a small change but it makes all the difference in the world
like a rock climber in a crevasse julia shimmies up the walls of the cell by bracing herself in a corner and using her hands and feet to push up
the tile is slippery and each movement precarious
she uses strength and balance to reach a position just below the plexiglass the fluorescent light bathing her in an eerie intense glow
she sees a gap between the glass and the wall and uses her engagement ring to dig into it scape scrape scraping with the diamond
the shower sprays water
julia nearly loses her balance but manages to stay pressed into the corner
she kicks the shower head sending the spray as far from her as possible and continues to dig at the caulking around the light fixture
in the observation room we see something unexpected
the clock reads
that water isnt going to stop
miriam and ramsey return to the lab to find henry anxiously observing from the console
flustered she changed the codes
it would take hours to re route the system and even if i did i shouldnt
what are you talking about
miriam analyzes the situation and regretfully angrily worriedly realizes whats happened
shes done it
stupid stupid girl
instead of going into his mind
shes bringing stargher into hers
a bright deliriously colorful realm visually reflective of things we saw in catherines home
unusual trees rock formations totems statues and a brilliant pool of water
the pond ripples
visible through the crystal clear water is young stargher rising to the surface like a drowning victim suddenly breaking through to air
panicked he scrambles to shore and pulls himself to land
although the place is comforting and beautiful hes in strange territory and it frightens him
shivering he hunches down eyes darting this way and that
youre all right carl
the boy turns toward the voice and finds catherine her hair waving in the wind skin glowing eyes bright cutting a magnificent figure in clothes that make her a warrior
she opens her arms and the boy runs to her basking in the comfort of her embrace
he shivers and she holds him tightly
its okay honey youre with me now
youre safe here
she looks deeply into his eyes and reassuringly explains
i promised i would help you and i always keep my promises
catherine is astonished and relieve to hear him speak
a sad trembling little voice
can i stay here
she is touched that he would ask and strokes his face
no honey im sorry
its doesnt work that way
the boy breaks away from her turning his back
she gently takes his hand but he yanks it free
but what if i told you you could come visit
he slowly turns to her
ill make sure it happens carl
ill get them to let me do it
maybe we can
young starghers eyes open wide with silent terror
over his shoulder she sees a snake slither through the pool
centipedes crawl over her legs and hair
she stands and brushes them off
the atmosphere grows darker and ominous
he found me
catherine bristles as stargher king rises from the pool like a human serpent
the brilliant colors of catherines world fade to grim tones
he always finds me
stargher king screeches with anger and confusion
where thiisss att
me god no like id here
he snarls when he sees catherine
priddy bish hor kund
you big trubble mekker
sneers at the boy and you
you cumm home now liddle cogsugger worm
or me god haffa punish you
young stargher tightens his embrace of catherine
she steps back away from the pond hugging the boy tightly
stargher king laughs
hoo you thing you are
he comes close and reaches for the boy
you gimme liddle worm
for a moment catherine appears frightened and intimidated
perhaps near an emotional breakdown
but that is not the case
she quietly lowers little carl to the ground and whispers something in his ear
as the boy nods runs and hides a ferocity grows within her
i said no
like a vengeful valkyrie she emits what can only be called a battle cry
arms reaching for her
catherine blocks punches and kicks
stargher king doubles over
catherine grabs his ears and pulls his face into her bent knee breaking his nose
welcome to my world
as blood flows from his nostrils stargher king grins
you thing you stop me god
at the right moment catherine sidesteps and smashes him in the ribs as he passes
stargher king crumples to the ground and she kicks an uppercut to this chin
rising from the mud and muck stargher king lands a powerful blow to her head sending her flying
he lifts the stunned catherine with one hand and pulls her face to his
you cum back wif me god
you be good bish hor kund
catherine looks into his soulless eyes
then spits in them and bites his face
she breaks free as he yowls with pain
he steps toward her but his feet dont move
the earth itself appears to wrap around them and turn hard like concrete
stargher king howls with frustration
a shimmering knife seems to enrage from within her forearm out the flesh and into her hand
she slashes across his chest drawing blood
and turns to see the distraught young stargher
dont hurt him
she spins around and sees not stargher king but martin
he didnt mean it
i was bad
disturbed by the transformation catherine backs away
her vision blurs the sound distorts
and the earth cracks around stargher kings ankles
he teached me a lesson
i deserved it
fighting feelings of disorientation she kneels before the child and rests the knife on the ground
no one deserves it carl
she reaches out to him but the child is jerked into the air by stargher king
in one hand the monster holds little carl
in the other a knife
his face and chest red with crimson stargher king fixes his eyes on catherine with a predators stare
stargher king raises the blade toward the boys throat and snap
the strong arms of an adult stargher breaks his arm at the elbow
both the knife and boy are dropped to the ground as stargher king yowls like a stuck pig the good arm cradling the other
me god hurt
why you do that
stargher king regards him with disgust
martin starghers voice comes from the belly of the beast
ill tell you whats enough
stargher and stargher king square off
the boy stands between them with the knife at his feet
still speaking as martin shut up cunt
to the boy give it here worm
the child picks up the blade and stands between them looking to catherine for guidance
as martin you want a mommy
is that what you want
in an almost dream like motion the child hands the blade to adult stargher
and he drives the thing into stargher kings heart
for a brief moment martins face is superimposed over stargher kings
stunned he slumps and regards adult stargher with sad troubled eyes
as stargher king why
whatd i do
stargher twists the handle of the blade and martin stargher king drops dead
young stargher smiles and hugs catherine
time to go way
the boy runs to adult stargher who lifts the child into his arms and holds him close
she looks to adult stargher and begins to understand
he descends into the pool the boy resting his head on his shoulder
thank you catherine
you did help me
more than youll ever know
man and boy disappear beneath the waters surface
catherine stands and sees that stargher kings body has vanished
she walks to the shore and sees deep underwater stargher and little carl floating lifelessly like women in the cell
and fade from view
she presses the sensor in her hand
in the control room miriam is shocked by what she sees on the monitors and looks at stargher
hes in full arrest
catherine quietly returns to consciousness and is automatically lowered
she pulls the mask from her face rises and opens the door
miriam races inside and desperately attempts to revive stargher
but its no use
angry and stunned she demands of catherine
but catherine chooses not to
she knows carl stargher will never return to the world of the living
the chopper roars across the sky
as they head northeast away from the urban and toward the rural novak gazes out the window trying to stay focused fighting any after effects of the drugs
the pilot communicates via headset
cole and a handful of other agents pour into waiting suburbans
intercut with novak in helicopter
the hoist was manufactured by carver industrial equipment in
serial number j
purchased by a boat shop in lake havasu but sold to lattimers industrial supply in
the water is near the ceiling
kicking her legs to keep afloat julia digs with the ring and we see she has created a gap between the light fixture housing and an unused pipe leading to
she pushes but cant get anything to move
the opening will get no bigger
julia sucks the last bit of oxygen and swims to the bottom of the cell
searching for something she finds a juice box and pulls out the drinking straw
shaken but oddly transcendent catherine watches as starghers body is wheeled out of the lab on a gurney
she comforts a whimpering valentine and tells him
everythings alright now valentine
novak scans the topography of farms below listening to a new report
cole is the passenger on the radio to novak a driver next to him doing about a hundred down the interstate siren blaring
lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near delano
bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land its just sitting there
and guess who they hired to seal up the place
youre kidding me
i never kid
my wife hates it
says im too serious
novak locates delano on the map
the exact location cole
give it to me
the pilot grins and pushes the copper to top speed
julia is entirely underwater but alive
she uses the straw to suck oxygen through the gap in the ceiling but its difficult to tread water and her lungs are aching
novak uses binoculars to scan farmland
and there it is the abandoned farmhouse
julia tries to hold herself up by pressing her arms and legs against the walls but as she does the straw slips from her mouth
she reaches for it but only succeeds in pushing it away from her
it heads for the drain
the helicopter lands and novak jumps out
he knows this is the place
he runs into the barn but theres nothing no sign of her
the pilot looks at him with a true sense of loss
as julia desperately tires to find the straw through the tiny holes of the drain we see for the first time an expression which tells us shes given up
thump thump thump
the cell starts to vibrate
a repetitive noise whup whup whup comes from above
she swims to the top of the cell and pounds at the ceiling
fighting exhaustion and the side effects of the drugs novak pushes on
think peter think
his eyes find the water tanks and he shouts at the helicopter
cut the engine
as the motor dies novak listens and listens
there it is
water pipes beneath his feet
and very faintly a pounding
he follows the sound searching the earth
its clearer now louder
novak tosses aside rusted junk and the pilot runs to assist him
together they expose the entrance to the underground sanctuary
novak drops to the floor below
instantly affected by the similarities and the differences to the idealized cell of starghers mind he feels another wave of dizziness but pushes on
and is hit hard by the sight of drowned julia her motionless body floating past him
her eyes open and bubbles drift from her nose and mouth
novak bangs on the plexiglas and calls to her
the thick plexiglass still remains but she now can see him
novak pulls his id badge and smacks it against the glass
he pulls his gun and takes aim
julia swims to the top of the cell and presses herself against the ceiling
bang bang bang bang bang bang
novak fires a circle of shots into the thick plastic
water slowly leaks but the damn thing is still solid
he lifts the industrial vcr and rams it at the bullet damaged section
water pours from the cell
julias body descends on the torrent of water
novak reaches inside and pulls her to safety
hes just about to give her cpr when she coughs sputters and thirstily drinks in oxygen
holding her tightly novak sinks to the floor the water from the cell spilling everywhere
coles suburban leads a contingent of fbi vehicles and local police cars onto the property sirens blaring
hearing the sirens novak relaxes
for the first time in god knows how long he relaxes
and holds julia hickson as if his life depended on it
two cars parked outside
an old quirky volvo and a land rover
as a television plays the wizard of oz we find catherine watching the movie from the couch sitting up drinking a cup of tea
she looks rested and quite cute in gym shorts and a t shirt her cat sleeping next to her
in the kitchen miriam packs up her stethoscope and blood pressure monitor moves into the living room as dorothy falls asleep in a field of poppies
i left the nutritional information on the fridge door
catherine nods but shes more interested in the movie
miriam deposits prescription bottles onto a side table
i refilled the zyprexa and atavan
i dont need them anymore
but she leaves them just the same
ill come by tomorrow after work
say hi to henry and
give a kiss to edward
overlapping give a kiss to edward
the women exchange smiles and miriam exits
as miriam walks to her land rover she sees a government issue suburban park on the street and peter novak exit
youre looking well
six weeks off does a body good
conspiratorially i heard she got the approval to try the reversal with edward
thats a secret
federal bureau of investigation maam
we know all see all
novak opens the rear compartment of the suburban and we hear something moving inside
hows the patient
awaiting his arrival
what about the cat
miriams pager beeps and she hurries to her car
ive got to go
novak smiles waves goodbye and reaches into the suburban
as dorothy and her companions confront the wizard theres a knock at the screen door and catherine sees novak waiting
catherine cradles her cat
he opens the door and escorts a leashed valentine into the living room
catherines cat squirms from her arms and hides under the couch
that went well
give her a minute
smiles at the dog hello valentine
novak unleashes the albino shepherd and he runs to catherine licking her face wagging his tail
you sure about this
calling for the cat abigail
valentine picks up the cats scent and sniffs around the base of the sofa
i heard julia and john got married
good for them
valentine settles on the floor
slowly abigails curiosity gets the best of her and she creeps out sniffing the dogs nose
patient and sweet valentine lies still allowing the cat to reach an acceptable level of comfort
well look at that
i told you
you have to be optimistic
believe in them
so you say
amazingly abigail brushes up against the dog and purrs
my boss says its one of the strangest requests the bureaus ever had
she likes that
he also says that until proven differently julia hickson was found as a result of good old fashioned detective work
it doesnt matter
i dont know
i think it does
genuine concern you know catherine
if you ever want to talk about it
what happened to stargher
that last time
its painfully clear the thought of it still troubles her
not just yet
novak doesnt push it
he just takes her hand and gives it a gentle squeeze
the cat dashes into the kitchen and valentine follows
i got it
he moves into the kitchen
in a moment of quiet introspection catherine looks at the television screen at dorothy accidentally hitting the wicked witch with a bucket of water causing her to melt
and she looks away unable to watch disturbed by the image
she turns to the kitchen and sees novak feeding an appreciative dog and cat
he rises and returns to the living room
he smiles and nods gently resting his hand on her shoulder
catherine shuts her eyes and leans toward him comforted by simple human touch
