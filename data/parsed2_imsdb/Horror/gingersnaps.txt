written by karen walton july th the house is dark
the moon is almost full
a dog barks
a melancholy voice worn for its age narrates brigitte v o ever try bein different
an i dont mean jus thinkin about it either
ginger an me i mean i
the house numbers read
the slips the number now reads
ginger an i
went for different
theres a light on in a basement window
we creep up to it crushing the tulip
borders on the way
the window is propped open with a sneaker it looks like somebodys foot is caught in it
music plays inside gyrating in her underwear to bad girl grunge brigitte fitzgerald straddles ginger fitzgerald also and in underwear on one of the twin single beds
both girls have cigarettes lolling on their lower lips
both girls have pierced eyebrows pierced noses and streaked hair
brigitte has blue nail polish on
ginger has breasts
quit dickin around
jus do it
brigitte reluctantly stops her thrashing and douses a cotton ball in rubbing alcohol
without looking up from her tank girl comic ginger hauls her own shirt up to expose her navel
brigitte swabs gingers navel with the wet cotton ball
her eyes drift to gingers chest then back to what shes doing
gingers ten months older than me
were seriously tight
around them many candles burn
theres a dead bolt on the door
an attached full bath
the floors are thick with paranormal books
the walls are covered in images of ufos and horror flicks
a framed photo of kurt cobain with courtney love has a place of honor
theres an old polaroid of the girls at five in halloween costumes lill red riding hood and the big bad wolf
ginger is the wolf
brigitte produces an enormous darning needle
she levels it at gingers navel her hand shaking
without looking up uh huh
ginger gives brigitte a look over the top of her comic
brigitte takes a deep breath and lines the needle up again
brigitte swallows hard and applies pressure
the needle pierces gingers skin
her stomach muscles flinch
you said it wouldnt hurt
jus hurry up
the needle has stopped moving half way through the skin
brigitte wiggles the needle
blood wells up around it
i think its stuck
ginger lowers her comic
she takes one look at the needle half
in half out of her belly button and cracks up
snot funny ginger
laughing her head off ginger gives the needle a good tug from her end
the skin tugs with it resisting
ali gawd gross
ginger yanks the needle hard
this time it moves
i got it i got it
ginger grits her teeth
the needle begins a slow progress
its goin its goin gimme the ring brigitte grabs at a tiny silver ring on the bed spread but knocks it to the floor
brigitte scrambles after it
ginger yanks the needle
brigitte finds the ring and hands it to ginger
ginger sets the ring on the end of the needle looping it not so neatly through
oh groo oo o ss
the bloody needle pops clear
ginger grinds on the ring to close it
ginger wipes her bloody hands on the bed
brigitte is taking deep gulping breaths
i think so
yeah i think not
if you dint say it hurt id a been fine
ginger beams at her new piercing
pretty cool unh
the flesh around the navel is hot pink and bruising
brigitte grins too
now ill do you
brigitte bravely hangs onto to her smile
we do everything together
but at fifteen
a chick can change
you got no idea
its a beautiful autumn day in suburbia
the terrier next door norman barks and barks
a pierced navel is stretched taught filling with blood
gingers limp body is bent backward over a low fence
blood is flowing from where shes been speared through her chest gingers impaled on a white picket
dont get me wrong
its not like we were all happy or nothin to begin with
brigitte takes a long ponderous drag on her cigarette as unmoved she takes in gingers mortal wound
brigitte eyes the identical homes and gardens that stretch on to the horizon
the suburb of bailey downs
basically a well lit black hole
the kingdom of cul du sac
thats french for dead end
brigitte flicks her smoke into a pile of neatly raked leaves
it smolders then goes out
you had a gram of personality out here
life bit the big one
a truck with county regreening program on its side pulls up a few houses over
brigitte watches a shirtless sun bronzed adonis sam climb out of the cab
of course im generalizing
a tarty teenage girl trina bounds up to sam and gives him a big wet one
no im not
the fuck bee
take a picture already
brigitte raises a mm still camera to her eye and frames her sisters corpse in the viewfinder
a slide of ginger dead on a white picket fence smashes on
the head credits are superimposed on each of the slide images snap
ginger sliced up with an electric knife in the kitchen snap
ginger drowned in a bubble bath snap
ginger hanged by nylons in the laundry room snap
ginger mangled under the front tires of a mini van
the fitzgerald sisters stand over a slide projector in art class just finishing the slide show from the credit sequence
an empty frame of blinding white light snaps onto the collapsible screen at the front of the room
the homely art teacher looks very concerned as she hits the lights
the other students a all about fifteen middle class and raging conformists sit in stunned silence
as brigitte and ginger return to their side by side seats we were always considered freaks
for as long as i can remember there was us
and there was them
like from kindergarten
the students trade constipated looks
what does it mean for you
brigitte shrugs and squirms
means theres more to life than well li
the fitzgeralds look expectantly at row after row of blank faces
brigitte shakes her head
attempts at communication wore futile
jason mccardy a good looking high school casanova looks ginger over appraisingly
ginger ignores him
some of them did seem to wanna reach ginger
brigitte glances from gingers breasts to her own flat chest
brigitte takes a deep breath
but nobody wanned to reach me
the bell goes
a tad defensive like i cared
teens clog the halls
judging by the herd bailey high is not big on individual identity or at least its outward expression
ginger and brigitte slip down the crowded corridors sticking out like sore thumbs
ginger holds her forehead
they hurt my brain
they didnt even get it
theyre bone heads
they re somnambulists
theyre the goddamn walkin the girls stop before their locker
a folded up piece of loose leaf has been crushed into it its end sticking out
ginger opens the locker
she unfolds the paper
theres a big fat joint inside and a note that says ginger call
ginger pockets the joint crumples the paper into a ball and tosses it at a near by trash can
the girls head down the hall
somebody leaves you all
these jays an yer not even curious to call
ginger offers her a sucker and has one herself
a fat janitor scoops up the wad of loose leaf with great resentment and jams it into the trash
brigitte and ginger pass a necking couple practically dry humping girls applying make up to one another and boys snapping each other with their sports cups
jason and his fellow jock pals tim frank and jeremy are scoping babes
ginger bends to tie her boot lace and a collective groan swells from the guys
shes weird but hot
anybody poled fitzy yet
brigitte gives them a disgusted look
not that one
the cute one
brigittes face falls
ginger gives them a death stare
the boys try flirty smiles
to brigitte sad
must be hard to think with yer brains slappin around yer thighs like that all day
ginger pulls her on past a sign gymnasium
we didnt do guys
guys were too gross
everyone at bailey high was just too incredibly gross
ginger applies her boot to a swinging door and they enter the fitzgeralds stop dead
they take in a menagerie of wanna be girls changing for gym class
the background chat is all sex and mascara
there is only one free spot next to trina and her trina clones
the trinas slide into a size too small shorts while parading hefty chests
the trina acts like she owns the goddamn planet
the only thing worse than most teenage boys are most teenage girls
trinas are the limit
ginger digs at her lower abdomen painfully
i feel sick
gingler opens a locker and tears off her clothes
other girls glance at her navel piercing with disgust
brigitte is very self conscious she steps almost inside the locker hiding behind the door while she changes into the revolting school gym outfit
she eyes the buxom bubble heads with contempt as there was really only one trina but they were all the same
trina finds the fitzgeralds open locker door a nuisance
she pushes it out of her way hard enough to whack brigitte in the head on the other side
ginger gives trina a very dirty look
brigitte tries to rub her sore head while clutching her uniform to cover her chest
trina and her posse cackle as they prance out their butt cheeks waggling
the sisters continue changing
to brigitte y okays i hate her
like to feed her ground glass with tacks for desert
then make her puke it back up and swallow it again until shes like shredded to a bazillion pieces from the inside out
ginger grips her sides painfully and bends double
whats the matter
i got gas
maybe ill try an cut one right in her face out there
they slap hands laughing
they look down at their gym outfits which are so unflattering
brigitte and ginger exchange identical looks of agony
the twenty or so participants in this all girl gym class stand ready at centre field in lacrosse padding and helmets
brigitte and ginger stand apart from the others sharing a smoke
brigitte looks scared
ginger looks ill
after two weeks a high school
ya come to the conclusion its all about agony
ed sus practise takin pain
the gym teacher
sykes an aging former traffic cop hucks the players sticks with nets on one end
sykes is given to screaming
field lacrosse is no pussy assed tea party ya get in there get a lock on your target and push it
i want sweat i want action
the trinas giggle at sykes
ginger bends forward holding her sides
shake a leg fitzgeralds
an butt out you gotta death wish
feel really sick mz
cigarettesll do that for you
ginger flicks the smoke at sykes turned back
it falls short of course
the sisters trudge to their places on the field
ginger is on the offensive line
brigitte is in goal
is not optional at bailey high
sykes blows the whistle
a fast moving hard hitting lacrosse scrimmage begins
in rapid fire montage ginger gets caught in the crunch of sticks and bodies pushed kicked and punished by the trinas who are having fun
in rapid fire montage brigitte visibly cowers as a tangle of marauding ball whacking bodies descend on her
she takes a number of direct hits from the hard rubber ball
on a powerful press for a goal trina slams into brigitte so hard brigitte flies right out of the net area
and skids face first
into a mangled dogs body
the whistle blows and play stops
ginger lopes over breathless gripping her sore stomach
i been waiting for this
thered been a lot of dead dogs around lately but this was my personal first
brigitte slowly climbs out of the mucky canine remains to her knees
shes covered in doggie guts and maggots
oh how gro o o o oss
ginger snaps walton july the class edges toward them but maintains a horrified distance
even sykes struggles with a gag reflex on seeing brigitte s mess
brigitte fingers the dogs remains with a look of fascination
kay heres the weird thing about me
i dig dead stuff
live things make me sick theyre all warm and snotty and shitty and pissy
and live things jus suffer which i cant take
but a dead thing
skinda beautiful cause a dead things really i dunno like free
dont touch it fitzgerald
whats wrong with you two
get up and hit the showers
drains the blood out and drinks it ya know
heard they have sex with them first
gawd stop youll make me puke
everyone was all like oh its a teen cult or aah its some looney the beast a bailey downs
all right ladies settle
this is no joke
you have information about the dog deaths you do by rote tell a teacher principal fardor or the police
teen cult my ass
look ginge something went for its throat its not cut its chewed
brigitte looks up in time to see gingers eyes roll back in her head
the class inhales as one
sykes and the class stampede up
sykes pushes brigitte out of the way
gingers no pussy
she doesnt faint
i might faint
like if this pooch were only half dead i could faint
brigitte stumbles over the dog carcass
she hugs herself
brigitte sits in her bloodied uniform chewing her nails
nurse ferry a mrs
re type who chirps more than speaks is examining ginger
the fainting s worrisome you dont diet do you dear
anemias very common at your age
eat more red meat try an iron vitamin supplement
if it happens again straight to a proper doctor all righty
brigitte looks relieved
now as for the headache cramps lower back pain
im guessing your period is due
i havent got a um period
flow old are you
our mother says were late bloomers
well judging by your troubles id say you can expect to blossom any time now
brigitte pulls a face
ferry produces numerous samples of feminine hygiene products and heaps them onto ginger
are you familiar with all these
now what suits one girl might not be comfortable for another
the proper form of protection is a personal choice and may have a lot to do with your menstrual flow which naturally changes during the time youll have your little
miracle of nature
it could start thick and syrupy move to a straight forward basic bright red bleeding and then perhaps a deep brownish to blackish slime signaling the end of the flow
twenty eight days later or there abouts itll start all over again and continue every month until menopause in about thirty years time
nurse ferry produces a pocket calendar with a tampon or pad advertisement for every month
heres a little calendar to keep track count from the day it starts twenty eight days
thatll be your next time
you have any questions come see me again
to brigitte you too sweetheart be your turn shortly i expect
brigitte looks horrified
heres a dirty word
that fate fully intended us to be typical in any way sooner or later was so insulting
ginger and brigitte trudge homeward looking completely depressed
brigitte flips through the feminine hygiene calendar
ginger watches the pavement beneath her feet
reading a panty liner ad some days its all you need
what does that mean
so you pulled a quincy on that dog unh
ginger grabs the calendar and sticks it in her pocket
quincy that guy with the stiffs on cable
alls i remember is you goin teen cult my ass
well i dunno
she gives ginger a funny look
why are you looking at me like that
do i look different
can you tell im going to
ginger squints at her unconvinced
ginger snaps walton july wham
how can i have a miracle of nature an not be old enough to drive
ginger kicks a kiddie toy hard into a yard
brigitte doesnt have an answer to this
their house looks like a set in a home show
the girls take it in from the front drive with expressions of complete weariness
next door norman the terrier barks at them
if i start simpin around tampon dispensers and moanin over cramps or even think about buying somethin that says baby powder fresh
shoot me right
i il of course
they exchange grins
out by sixteen or dead in this scene
ginger raises her hand and brigitte smacks it hard
as they mount the drive ginger picks up a stone and hucks it at norman whos still barking
if we failed to get a life by gingers sixteenth birthday
we were sposed to gas ourselves in the garage
for smart girls we could be pretty dumb
we probly never woulda done it but we seemed to need a deadline
the fitzgerald family are having their evening meal
their parents henry see mens section seers catalogue and pamela see martha stewarts idea of living are liberal middle class folks in their early forties
ginger looks bored
brigitte eats like a pig
how was school today
the nicest thing i could say about henry and pamela was also the meanest thing i could say
didnt you have a presentation
howd it go
pamela and henry exchange irritatingly patient smiles
they were easily satisfied
a rogues gallery on the wall depicts henry and pamelas transformation over the years from angry young ban the bomb types into middle class mundane
made an appointment for you girls at my gynecologist
henry studies his plate
ginger almost imperceptibly shakes her head at brigitte
brigitte nods understanding
you know why
were not going to a gynecologist
what did i say about that tone of voice
you are going to the gynecologist
shes completely paranoid
id rather stay out of this
shes gonna have some fat jerk get his jollies poking his fingers up our
im actually eating here
henry neither one of them has had a period yet
as pamela says the next line ginger mou t hs it word for word
its very odd that two perfectly healthy fifteen year olds are not menstruating
briggitte apes henrys next line back to ginger
steaks really yummy tonight
this a new sauce
the sisters giggle
pamela is losing her cool
i started at eleven
the problem must be on your side henry
this is not my fault
no ones at fault here
when did your sister start
ive told you i really have no idea
oddly enough we never discussed it
why dont you call her and ask her yourself
i cant call her out of the blue and ask a thing like that
besides its dinner time
theyll be eating
well ive been checking panties for four years now mo othe er
you look at our underwear
hey hey i dont want to hear that word in my house
you will do as your mother says and i will change the subject
anybody going to tell me what happened to my fence
from under the table henry produces the bloodied sawed off picket stained bloody from gingers impaling
brigitte holds her full mouth open so ginger can see its masticated contents
ginger cracks up laughing
henry and pamela sigh
norman the terrier barks off screen constantl brigitte grimaces at the cartoon style diagrams of how to insert a tampon
she carefully unwraps one and sets it in a glass of water
she times its expansion on her watch
why dint you jus tell her youre going to get it
ginger is dissecting the gift joint from their locker
she sniffs its contents
cant take her attention
she grosses me out
cant believe shes our mother
brigitte puts a fresh tampon up her nose and lifts a polaroid camera at arms length from her face
yeah but now we have to see this doctor
you can jus say you got it but im screwed
the polaroid spits out the front
brigitte sticks another tampon in her free nostril and one in each ear as did i get you out of home ec
did i get you out of ballet classes
so ill get you out of this right
you better gawd the idea flash
brigitte takes a polaroid of herself with a tampon sticking out of every visible orifice
ginger slides the grass into a pre rolled fresh casing and sticks it in her mouth
i said i will i will
this jays fine
let us smoke sister
ginger cranks the stereo and throws on a coat
she double takes brigitte s tampon face
what are you doing
sticking tampons under her upper lip look a walrus
ginger steps up on the bed and swings the ground level window open
norman the terriers incessant barking goes on in the distance
the moon is full tonight
a plastic childs playhouse sits in their next door neighbors back yard
a cloud of blue smoke emanates from its doors and windows
there is an occasional flash
from within and the whir of the polaroids motor
in the moonlight the joints cherry burns hell fire red
a couple of polaroid buddy shots sit at their feet
brigitte tokes and passes the jay to ginger
howl you know when you finally get it any ways
probly feel like peein your pants
well im not too excited
checking her watch were missing unsolved mysteries
wish i was an unsolved mystery
brigitte reflects on this heavy thought nodding stoned
you smell somethin gross
ginger snaps walton july the girls sniff around the playhouse
ginger steps on something that makes an evil squeeshy sound
she skids and ends up on her ass
this is so not my day
brigitte helps her to her feet
ginger shakes what she slipped on off her shoe
its a long ropy intestine
she drags her shoe to get the blood and goo of it
thrilled to recognize the smell that isnt shit
a line of blood and gore trails across the grass to a back lane
brigitte follows it
ginger looks around for something on the ground
lost the jay
ginger joins brigitte whos squatted before another dogs body
this ones a fresh kill
ack its still warm gross
brigitte takes its picture flash
with the polaroid which is strung around her neck
why every dog but the mutt next door to us
hey we could take it home
try like an autopsy
like crack the case
lets put im in there so he wont
lraumatize the kiddies
ginger indicates a construction dumpster on the end of the lane
disappointed bee rolls down her sleeves to cover her hands
ginger does the same and they shovel the body onto their arms
they trot the dog over to the dumpster
we never do what i wanna do
oh c mon
would stink up the whole room
they hoist the dog up and dump it in the dumpster
its hind end sticks out
brigitte climbs into the dumpster dragging it all the way in
dusting herself off ginger notices some blood on her thigh
ginger wipes at the blood with her hand
she lifts up the hem of her skirt
her face falls
she looks around
she slips her fingers up to her crotch
her hand comes out bloody
i just got the curse
brigitte stops rooting garbage over the dog
ginger wiggles her wet fingers at her
we gotta go home
brigitte catches her kilt on a nail sticking out of a plank in the trash
something is crunching through the leaves toward them
ginger peers out into the darkness
hurry upt im stuck a few homes down a garages motion sensitive security lamp trips on
ginger squints blinded
brigitte contorts to deal with the nail
brigitte tears her hem free and jumps down
the light snaps off
indicating the opposite direction lets go this way
brigitte dips a hand back into the dumpster for the plank with the nail
off gingers look brigitte shrugs
they start walking down the lane
the greenery behind them starts swelling again
the leaves crunch faster
brigitte and ginger look at one another and walk faster
the lane empties behind a deserted strip mall
whatever is behind them knocks an empty trash can over
brigitte grabs gingers arm scared
this is stupid
were getting farther from home
ginger is pissed off now
she turns to confront their stalker
to the darkness all right you ass shes cut cold by a roaring blur of speeding fur and teeth and claws something takes ginger down hard
we cannot see it as a whole we cant make out what it is
its big heavy and raging
immense jaws snap vicious teeth going for gingers jugular
brigitte drops her plank
brigitte grabs and kicks at the creature
ginger raises her arms and covers her head screeching and kicking
the thing grabs ginger by the scruff and shakes the living daylights out of her
brigitte snatches up the plank with the nails
brigitte brings it down hard on the thing screaming
she smacks it once twice
the plank pops a shot off the camera flash
a horrible set of jaws and one golden eye are caught for a split second in the light
the third hit evokes a yelp and the thing backs off snarling
brigitte quakes with the board raised ready
the thing skitters before her as she screams
ginger scrambles to her foot and grabs bee with bloodied hands
go go go go go go
brigitte drops the plank and they run like hell
for a main thorough way ahead
it pursues them
the late night traffic is light but consistent
the thing is still coming
at a dead run brigitte and ginger sail between moving cars
the thing burns behind them
the girls are barely missed by an approaching truck
there is a long blast of a horn
then a sickening thud
brakes squeal incto a stop as a horrible dragging scrain fills the night air
the girls crash to the sidewalk spilling over top of one another
they glance over their shoulders even as they disappear into a new residential stretch
the county regreening program truck sits at a right angle in the road its front end smashed
sam slowly opens the cab door
he staggers to the bloody grill clearly shaken
he looks under the truck and follows a wet trail of gore back behind it to the mangled furry mass about twenty feet back
he takes it in stunned
then sam vomits
brigitte scrambles through the window and helps ginger through after her
theyre bloody sweaty and tearful
they slump shaking side by side on gingers bed catching their breath
brigitte notices the rivulets of blood trickling down gingers arms
gingers shirt is soaking with growing red stains
ginger looks at herself
ginger starts to cry
the fuck was that bee
brigitte flings open the vanity and collects various first aid items gauze tape band aids iodine
she snags a washcloth and wets it at the tap
i couldnt remember ginger crying ever
brigitte flies out to where ginger is painfully pealing off her shirt shaking and sobbing
brigitte offers ginger the wet cloth but gingers helpless
ginger sshhh dont kay
carefully brigitte begins to dab at gingers arms with it wiping off the blood
the damage is gradually revealed massive claw marks deep scratches and puncture wounds bite marks
brigittes eyes fill with tears
okay this is really bad
you need a doctor ginge i cant stop all the no
not tellin anybody
get in shit for bein out smokin up dont tell
what if you get sick
what if these bites get infected
i wont tell
brigitte starts tearing off strips of gauze and taping it on thick
oblivious ginger fumbles for a smoke
she cant get the lighter to work
wanted to kill me
i could tell
giving into tears i know i know
i was so scared i thought you were me too
dont say it
brigitte lights her smoke for her
ginger takes a drag and passes it back to brigitte
brigitte resumes her first aid
yeah im okay
it was crazy it was like rabid or somethin shit look at the size of these bites
im okay im okay im okay
brigitte doesnt look convinced
brigitte snaps the port of an internal vacuum system open and reaches into the tube
she withdraws a sample size of jack daniels
ginger glugs some down and passes the last mouthful left to brigit
brigitte waves it
away o ginger finishes it al
i seen this thing on bears
said bearsd come after like chicks on the rag
cause of the smell
wasnt my fault
i didnt say that
wasnt a f uckin bear either
whatever it was it wasnt a bear
i know im not do i stink
can you smell it
geez i was jus whatever
a heavy silence falls between them
brigitte keeps working
doesnt feel anythin like peeing your pants by the way
its gross though
its really gross
i better ya know deal with that
gingers only half bandaged up
she staggers to the bathroom and shuts the door
brigitte eyes the polaroid camera a picture sits ready to be dispensed
she pulls it free
we do not see the photo
brigittes eyes bug out as she examines it
the toilet flushes in the bathroom and brigitte pushes the photo under the pillow on her bed
shaking her head
it was blurry
it was really outta focus so
ya couldnt tell it was really anything
ginger emerges pulling uncomfortably at her crotch
she climbs painfully onto her bed and collapses
that booze straight to my head man
you really okay
ginger es eyes are already fluttering shut
you saved me
brigitte leans in listening to ginger breathe
me too ginge
ginger snaps walton july
brigitte sits straight up in bed sweating with eyes wide
i woke up later i thought the thing was in our room
brigitte peers at ginger shes snoring
brigitte pulls out the polaroid and fires up her lighter to see by
this time we see it too
a streak of fur fangs and a golden glinting eye
then i remembered sam the tree planter killed it with his truck an we were okay
but really ginger
its noon hour
the grounds are full
brigitte is eating as she ticks off the fourth day in gingers feminine hygiene calendar
brigit le counts days from the first check mark
her pen hovers over the date halloween arid the next full moon
the first day was a full moon
brigitte slowly circles them both
ginger wears long sleeves to hide her bandages and shades
shes looking boys up and down as they pass
gingers stomach is growling
an untouched sandwich sits on her lap
gonna eat that
ginger shakes her head as she picks at her bandages
brigitte helps herself
sad but pamelas egg salad is her best thing
like that she can do
no response like when she puts the baby onions in
no response and she gobs on it and adds those hard little pieces of ginger pulls at her own crotch
pads suck so ya know
should eat something
thanks pamela im aware
off brigittes insulted look t dunno im all blaaahh i got this like i can taste what i want but nothins it
brigitte stops in mid chew
brigitte chews very slowly as she stares at ginger
ginger squints at jason and his pals across the yard
mccardys a stoner right
cmon i wanna feel better
ginger heads off toward the boys without waiting
brigitte is in mid mouthful and has to scramble to catch up
jason and his pals butcho conversation sputters as ginger strides up like a cat in heat
brigitte stumbles up behind her keeping her distance
ginger snaps walton july uh hi
nice day blah blah blah
got any smoke
grass weed dope green bud nancy
brigitte hesitates before a rusted out old boogie van its rear door open and waiting
blue smoke billows out
of the interior
brigitte looks confused
i was all like so who are you an what have you done with my sister right
brigitte climbs in
ginger jason tim frank and jeremy sit toking a gagger
the guys are giddy with lust
brigitte is huddled in a corner attempting invisibility
jason hands ginger the joint making sure their fingers touch
i thought your slide show in art was cool
oh yeah unh huh very cool
jason and ginger exchange a coy smile that makes brigitte toke really hard on her pass
brigitte passes the dube to tim who winks at her
brigitte sneers and looks at her watch
she makes a pained face at ginger but is ignored
this home grown
this guy we know
learned hydrophonics in the pen man
brigitte gapes at ginger who does not respond
brigitte hides beneath her hair and presses even further into a corner
she starts quietly ripping up the corner of the old shag rug
there is a codified knock on the vain door
speak of the devil
the back doors open and sam the tree planter stands in silhouette backlit by the day
his battered county truck waits behind him
he has a pit bull with him morely
sam the man
sam and morely hop in and close the doors
brigitte is frozen at the sight of sam up so close
what happened to your truck
had an accident on the
it was weird it
morely stomps into brigittes lap sniffing her crotch
to brigitte sorry about him hes an ass hole
my girlfriends she wont leave him at home alone any more
ya know dog killers
brigittes mouth is hanging open
morely slobbers all over her hands
i know i look like an asshole
gingers perma smug smile fades as she makes eye contact with morely
morel growls at her
sam is about to resume his accident story when watcha got for us
sam produces several baggies of grass
morelys hackles rise
brigitte looks from the dog to ginger ginger squirms
new harvest see whatcha think
to morely whats your problem
never seen a pretty girl before
ginger sneers at morely and morely bares his teeth
digging out cash thanks man
morely bursts out barking and charges at ginger
mayhem as the guys try to contain the dog in the small space
jason uses the opportunity to shield ginger for a free body press
brigitte gets banged and shoved
ginger kicks and screams at the dog her boot connects squarely with his snout
morely keels back and sam snaps him up
sorry hes not really like this
im really sorry
jus getim out
im really well see you guys
and in another flash of daylight sam and morely are gone
brigitte looks longingly at the closed door
the stone has set in and everyone but brigitte giggles as they settle
brigitte takes in the lesser mortals like theyre lepers
just hate dogs
they give one another this corny smile
brigitte bugs her eyes at ginger
ginger rises reluctantly
thanks for the smoke
maybe we could ginger places a finger to her lips then makes a finger gun and shoots him
ill letcha know
ginger grins ear to ear elbowing brigitte
ginger kicks the van doors open and saunters out
brigitte follows trying not to laugh
brigitte stands stoned out of her bean in the girls washroom
she imitates gingers cavalier farewell from the last scene
ill letcha ill jus let choo know
wanna tell me about you and like the planet yer currently visiting
brigitte squints at the tampon dispenser next to her
she tries to work it without putting money in
she smacks her dry lips
brigitte bends over the sink and drinks from the tap
ginger snaps walton july bee
brigitte doesnt hear her over the roar of the tap in her face
it shuts off automatically over her gaping mouth
brigitte puts her finger up the spout and almost gets it stuck
brigitte shuffles to the wrong door opens it and finds it empty
she giggles and moves to the next one
that smoke fucked me up
brigitte finds ginger with her shirt and all the bandages peeled off
she is dabbing at herself with wads of toilet paper
the scratches and bites are oozing a clear gelatinous goo under which a fine film of dark hairs have sprouted
brigitte steps into the stall agape
the door hits her on the way in
ginger and brigitte stand nose to nose in the stall
brigitte has not fully closed the door
ginger is just as stoned as brigitte
geez thats not right
whats the sticky stuff
ginger snaps walton july brigitte carefully rubs a finger over the fuzzy hair in the wounds
i got it on my tits too look

no its itchy
i cant have a hairy chest bee thats fucked
yeah like forget that tattoo you wanned
the idiocy of the looks of awe on the others face makes them both crack up
this isnt funny
laughing hard i know but okay
what i think
she counts on her attacked
on a full moon
now yer hairy
im not harry im ginger
snorting too stop im serious

ginger stops laughing long enough to let the suggestion settle
thats so stupid
they both burst into gales again
there is a sound outside the stall as the trinas prance in to powder their noses
the trina grabs the first stall door brigitte and gingers
brigitte and ginger stand frozen like the proverbial deer in headlights
trina does not see gingers transformation
but ginger is just doing her top up
trina backs away her hands to her mouth
gawd theyre lesbos
brigitte smacks her forehead
ginger steps out and leers at trina licking her lips in a grotesque mock lust
the trinas shrink back against the farthest wall
yeah whos next
im still sticky
brigittes jaw drops
ginger turns to leave and the trinas start to relax
ginger whips around again barking like a dog rrr uf ruf rr of rufrf ginger gives the trinas a good dead eyed stave and walks out
brigitte stumbles out after her
todays assignment is hacking up little pig feti
course trina dint waste any time
trina stares brigitte down as she folds up a note and passes it to a classmate
it is read and passed on by every kid in the room during this scene
brigitte holds her scalpel over the over their piggy hesitating
gingers attention is riveted on the little carcass
theyre all looking at us
ginger looks up at jason who is reading the note
jason smiles at ginger and destroys the note
ginger grabs the knife from brigitte
she makes a deep incision in the pigs belly
youre growing fur an acting like a nut is so
ginger spies two girls giggling at her
using both hands ginger cracks the carcass
wide open like a clam
ginger digs in gouging out the pigs parts with her bare hands
ginger breaks into a sweat her breathing gets heavy
brigitte cautiously looks around at their classmates
she moves to shield ginger from prying eyes
hold on im goi
n for the brain
ginger has begun scraping away at the pigs cranium with her finger nails
a sickening creak snap and the brain is exposed
ginger unconsciously licks her fingers as she admires its frontal lobe
brigitte fights a ralph
cant believe you did that
before brigitte can answer ginger lifts the brain out on her finger tips gently pushes brigitte out of her way and
the brain lands squarely on trinas head
what it slipped
as ginger stomps out with the teacher
brigitte and trina gape at one another
that week ginger was all over the map
she was the goddamn schizo poster girl
she forgot the gyno guy
i couldnt believe she forgot
brigitte is dying a thousand deaths on the examining table with her feet in stirrups
the gynecologist is examining her
a nurse stands next to him smiling benignly as she passes him the contraption used to take a pap smear
brigitte is almost in tears
same moment in the examination procedure but now ginger is in the stirrups
and the doctor is shocked at his findings
brigitte gives ginger a pout as they both shift uncomfortably in their seats
the doctor is gulping cups of water from the water cooler his hand shaking
he talks to pamela like the girls arent even there
ive never seen anything like it
shes not built like a normal girl
ive sent samples to the lab
but this is very very unusual
brigitte pokes ginger in the ribs
ginger doesnt like this and pushes brigitte so hard she almost falls off her chair
the window is open
norman the terrier yams
ginger is in a tank shirt which reveals her hair growth is spreading
brigitte is sitting at
the desk with a pile of monster books
whatre you nuts
i got a skin thing whatever
if you just gotta skin thing why does it get worse everytime yer being a bitch
whys the gyno say youre a monster inside
he dint say that
just listen to these symptoms
im takin a shower
ginger slams the bathroom door shut
brigitte consults her books and the feminine hygiene calendar days are ticked off
norman the terrier barks on
the key to his survival is a constant diet of fresh warm blooded victims
his appetite is insatiable and grows with each kill
but his appetite is also the key to his own demise ginger is in the shower
she runs shaking hands over her body
ginger hears normans barking as super amplified
its persistence is making her mental
for eventually the blood lust over takes human reason overtakes oven the instinct for self preservation and he will risk all for the excitement of the euphoric high of his
ginger shaves the delicate area around her ankles
she cuts herself and freaks
ginger snaps the lady bic in half and throws the pieces hard against the shower wall
fuck fuck fuck fuck there are two other broken razors in the stall stuffed with hairs
blood mixes with the water and swirls around her toes
the doq is still barkin
brigitte closes her book
but see all the books and movies an shit said it had to be a full moon that itd be all at once
an ya know not one word about chick werewolves on the rag
ginger flings open the door tears to the window hauls herself out and is gone
brigitte is after her in a heart beat
ginger is over the fence with ease
norman barks more harder
brigitte cant vault the fence
she clambers up a shared tree at the fence line to see
ginger tries to grab the dog but he dances around her barking like crazy
she grabs his snout with her bare hands and he bites her hard
now livid ginger takes up a dead tree branch
up in the tree brigitte hides her face in her hands
ginger racks the stick over the dogs head
the yelping stops but ginger keeps hitting
blood splatters over her face
and ginger tastes it
ginger drops her stick
she drags the body into the hedge next to the fence
brigitte lowers her hands from her eyes
ginger is directly below her concealed from the house by the shrubs
ginger falls to her knees before the corpse
she lifts a rattling hand to touch him
she lowers her face to the bloody mess
shes sweating vibrating physically resisting an irresistible drive
gingers tongue slips between her lips
and ginger licks morelys body
ginger begins to eat the dead dog
quickly becomes a ravenous frenzy
above her brigitte leans over the branch shes barely balancing on hyperventilating
vomit sails down from brigittes perch
ginger snaps walton july the porch light comes on behind ginger
brigitte scrambles down the tree and yanks ginger off the dog
gingers face is smeared in blood
gingers stunned and reels dizzily
they crouch waiting
their neighbor opens the screen door shaking a box of dog biscuits
the neighbor steps into the yard
approaches the hedge
stops right before them they can see a pair of slippers twitching in the grass
then they disappear the porch light switches off the screen door shuts
brigitte sits staring into space
ginger is showering in the attached bath
ho ow much is that daw gy in the window
ever been too sick to be sick
like the bottom of your stomach is wrapped over the top of your head
there is a knock at the door
brigitte checks the dead bolt is on
whos showering so late
brigitte throws up her hands what an idiotic conversation
howd she get im tryin to study here
oh all right then
brigitte slumps against the door
the showers stops
ginger appears in a towel pink and clean and freshly furry in places
shes in a really good mood
she takes one look at brigittes face of doom and tries to be serious
i couldnt help it
guess you were right
ginger finds and lights a smoke
you know whats really weird
weirder than killing a dog and i liked it
i liked it a lot
i feel all fucki
n goofy now
like i dunno
brigitte shakes her head over and over
i feel like i just got off the planet smasher ride at warworid okay
ginger leaps to the stereo and blasts on some tunes
she flails around the room wildly
ginger grabs brigitte by the arms and makes her dance too
ginger spins and spins brigitte who fights it but laughs
so shed killed norman
never seen anyone bliss out like that
i wanted to be so blissed jus once
there is repeated pounding on their door
brigitte still entangled in ginger hits the music off
little late for that girls
bite me sorry they stand in each others arms listening to pamela mount the stairs off screen
ginger shoves brigitte backward onto her bed
ginger piles on top of her playfully pinning her down
i want more
brigitte squirms fitfully
no its too gross
youll get caught
not if you help
brigitte looks into her sisters beaming face
jus keep watch
look im gonna be somethin totally else
tell me you dont so dig it
tell me you dont wanna see what happens
bailey downs sleeps soundly as the hunt begins
the moon is a sliver of its former self
ginger cocks her head at the sound of a dog barking
she lifts her nose into the wind and sniffs
ginger is prowls like a wild cat through yards and service lanes as a study in much less stealth brigitte stumbles trips and slips after ginger
splits her sweats climbing fences
loses a shoe over garage roofs gets caught in automated lawn sprinklers falls into hidden cellar window troughs as a series of dogs perk their ears and snarl from their
dog houses chains and porch perches
low whistles and smoochy sounds lure the dogs into bushes behind cars around fences
strings of dogs chains strain tight then slacken
ginger wild eyed bloody mouthed and euphoric tosses collars at brigitte
brigitte misses most of the tosses
she picks up the collars and fingers these souvenirs with disgust
a little kid decked out for hockey practice waddles into his yard with a full dog food dish
his feet squish along his pets entrails
he finds his dogs body and drops the dish with a clatter on the cement patio
m m mmomi
days get ticked off on the feminine hygiene calendar
brigitte vb we became the beast of bailey downs
we got good
the moon vanishes then reappears in as a first quarter as brigittes getting the hang of things she practices expert surveillance from car roofs throws stones to trip motion sensitive
lamps starts moving like a super spy taking crime scene style polaroids of their victims as gingers kills get quicker she gets wilder more daring more ruthless and
brigitte gets cooler confident collected
shes mapping out attack routes and leading the frothing ginger to the big scores like dog kennels
the more we did the crazier she got
under a swelling moon brigitte and ginger tear around in the dark screaming and laughing and rough housing
brigitte shoves a fist full of collars under their mattresses
on the field ginger climbs up on the goal post and walks carefully across the narrow beam
the crazier she got the more she needed me
i liked that part
in their room brigitte helps ginger shave her back
ginger trims her elongating nails
brigitte plucks hairs from gingers palms
ginger brushes her teeth and a piece of tooth comes off she has a little fang
on the field both brigitte and ginger hang upside down from the goal post by their knees
brigitte is wearing a dog collar as a necklace
they are laughing their heads off and trying to pull each others shirts down to expose each others breasts
gingersnaps walton july ginger holds her mattress up while brigitte stuffs handfuls of the collars underneath
they collapse exhausted
ginger crawls on her hands and knees to the toilet in the ginger drinks out of the toilet like a dog
ginger burps loudly and crawls back to join her sister who offers her a cigarette
you love it
brigitte examines the feminine hygiene calendar
in it a cartoon of a female egg is personified with a heels and sunglasses strutting across the date
trey look yer ovulating
ginger rubs her belly
im still hungry bee
how can you youve done every dog we can its not enough
i want somethin
i need more
all the kids lounging on the grounds double take the fitzgerald girls entrance this morning
ginger is babe alicious in a hot tiny tee boots shades and very short shorts
she projects unbearably untouchable
brigitte flanks her without the wardrobe but the attitude is there
jason gapes as ginger heads toward him with an unlit smoke between her pointy teeth
she leaves an inch between his chest and her breasts
got a light jace
jason and his pals all fumble for lighters and five little flames appear before her smoke
she lights her smoke on jasons and exhaling looks him up and down
the boys flames go out all at once
my sister would like one also
obediently they all light up for brigitte
brigitte falters before the attention
at gingers nod brigitte lights up too
ginger turns to see trina and the clones sizing her up
ginger seems to tower over the trinas today
trina cant match the menace
ginger exhales smoke in trinals face and climbs the steps into the school
brigitte double takes gingers back
gingers spine is protruding sharply through her shirt
trina leers at brigitte
better watch your back fitzenstein
brigitte snorts and follows ginger in
under her breath like im scared
ginger chews her nails like a dog does when cleaning them
brigitte and the rest of the class watch an rcmp officer holding a reward poster at the front of the room
we need your cooperation
if you know anything about the so called beast of bailey downs call in
you can be anonymous
as if they werent already
but your pets arent safe until the perpetrator is caught
ginger sighs loudly and brigitte prods her
the girls gym class is prepping for lacrosse again
the trinas square off across the half way mark from ginger
sykes blows her whistle
the scrimmage begins
trina whips the indian rubber ball right into gingers face
ginger drops her stick and launches herself at trina
play stops with the whistle but ginger and trina are just going at it
trina bites gingers sore arm and ginger rakes her nails over trinas neck
ginger draws blood
sykes breaks it up by dragging ginger off trina
sykes tends to triria who bawls
ginger wipes her bloody hand over her mouth
gingers rolling the taste of trinas blood around in her mouth
you cant do that thats human blood
brigitte and ginger stare at one another
ginger first shakes her head
but then nods
ginger looks around and whispers ginger snaps walton july its sick but im all like horny
brigitte makes a sour face
what she started it
brigitte watches ginger march to the sidelines throwing off her gear as she goes
pick that stuff up
ginger gives sykes the finger without looking back
brigitte waits outside a door marked guidance
trina struggles by with the help of her clones
trina sports a big ugly bandage on her neck knees and an arm in a sling
she shoots brigitte a death stare
yer bitch sisters dead freak
under her breath fuck off
jason lopes up
he indicates the guidance office door
ginger in there again
brigitte ignores him

brigitte s face clouds

under his breath freak
jason takes a post on the opposite brigitte to wait
brigitte glares at him
the grossly over weight guidance councilor mr
wayne is perched on the edge of his fake wood desk holding their death slides from the credit sequence up to the fluorescent light
his arm pits are stained with sweat
ginger slumps in a chair before him
there is a fish bowl full of condoms on his desk
ginger picks one out unwrapping it examining it as he talks
look you keep getting sent here
we might as well be friendly
i dont do friendly mr

ginger fakes an eye lash batting smile
she winds the condom over her erect fingers
okay you arent a kid

ginger snaps walton july ginger rubs the condoms lubricant between her two free fingers intrigued by the texture
im reaching out here

ginger gives him a cold dead stare

ginger slams the guidance office door on her way out
fuckin guidance my ass
she pounds her fist into a locker and makes a dent
ginger admires the damage
ginger notices jason and visibly brightens
whatcha doin now

jason and brigittes faces darken simultaneously
ginger we should get home
no we shouldnt
brigitte drags ginger aside
ginger notes brigittes hand squeezing her arm with a dangerous look
twenty minutes ago you coulda killed somebody

i dont think so
ginger shakes brigittes hand off
well i do

ginger takes jasons hand and pulls him off to the exit
jason gives brigitte such a smug look over his shoulder
brigitte stands alone in the hall gaping after them
when henry renovated the basement to build our room
i was like ten an in the way an shit
well he rammed iue with this beam right in my stomach
brigitte wanders over the emptying school
she looks small and alone
she looks disoriented
but all the air came outta my lungs at once an i kept tryin to breathe but i couldnt
i forgot all about that
till like right now
brigitte consults the hygiene calendar
gingers ending the third week of checked off days
a special note on todays date asks do you have pms
jasons van is parked on a rise that offers an impressive overview of bailey downs
the moon is rising
ginger and jason sit in the front seat of his van
theyre making out
ginger is enjoying herself
ginger bites his lip
ginger draws blood
cant believe you never had a boyfriend
ginger licks his blood from her own lips and freezes dead cold
jason dives back at her for more
ginger looks both aroused and unnerved by her arousal
gingers stomach growls
ginger pushes jason off of her
i have to go
its getting late
its only six oclock
jason presses himself on her again
ginger shoves him off hard

now you get all moody on me
hey you got no idea
ginger slams the van door and rushes away from the van
chicks yer all the same
ginger stops in her tracks
she shakes her head and continues away
brigitte shuffles along the curb the picture of dejection
she slows to watch sam loading some enormous tree branches into the back of his truck packing up for the night lie has been cutting back an enormous tree in
someones front yard
when sam glances her way brigitte picks up her pace without looking back
trina wears a radio headset that pounds post disco dance mix as she jogs
morely dashes in and out of the surrounding greenery
he dashes in once more and does not reappear
trina looks back expectantly
she runs in place waiting for him
she heads back looking for him
ginger pops out of the brush before trina
gingers face smeared with blood from mo
ginger grins insanely
ginger wiggles morelys collar
trina clicks off her head set
brigitte descends the stairs to her room
music blasts from the basement
tell your sister to turn that stereo down
brigitte lets herself in
the music is now deafening
trina is bound in a chair at the end of her bed screaming her head off
her screams are buried by the music
brigitte slams and locks the door behind her
yelling over noise stop screaming or ill rip your permed head right off you neck
an ya know what
i can do that
now open wide ginger force feeds trina something on a spoon
trina screams with her mouth full trying to spit it back out
ginger offers trina a glass of milk
ginger snaps walton july blood trickles out of the corners of trinas mouth as she chews while bawling
ginger sets the glass of milk on the desk
ginger what are you doing
ginger grins and shows bee a bowl of crushed glass and tacks
jus like you said bee
brigitte grabs the bowl away glass shards and tacks rain around them
are you crazy
im join this for you
as the sisters argue trina rocks the chair back and forth trying to free herself
oh no no way
yer still burnt over jason
no ginger im burnt cause you dont see like jail in yer future
you dont get how hugely fucked this is
trina lurches back hard and rocks forward
trina struggles to get her toes to meet the floor
she lurches back for more momentum
you sayin im stupid
im sayin she
will tell on you
this is someone who will tell
trina throws herself forward again and her toes connect firmly with the floor just as her temple connects with a sickening crack on the sharp corner of the desk
the milk glass dumps on top of her
brigitte and ginger look at her
trina hangs there in the chair at this strange angle for a moment dripping milk
then trina and the chair keel to the floor
trina is still
brigitte turns the music off and creeps up to trina
blood trickles out of trinas ear and swirls into the milky glass mess at her mouth
her open eyes stare at nothing
ginger grabs her own right arm most damaged by the original attack and shudders with pain
owchee wow ow
brigitte takes trina in from head to toe
brigitte checks trina for a pulse
brigitte snaps her hand back as though it were burned
a tremor wracks brigittes body and she convulses
brigitte runs to the bathroom
off screen brigitte throws up
meanwhile ginger raises her afflicted hand
the hand is nowsomething clearly on the way to being a wolfen paw
the nails are black curling claws
oblivious brigitte climbs back into bed and covers her face with a pillow
my life is basically over
awestruck they both watch as ginger extends and retracts her new set of claws
there is a knock at the door
the girls look at one another in mute horror
ginger addresses the door
are you two fighting
ginger snaps walton july
come on then
brigitte and ginger hop up and down in a brief freak fit
ginger has her new paw curled up in an over sized sweat jacket sleeve
brigitte stares at the stew before them with grave distaste
pamela has a number of used tissues around her shes been crying
the gynecologist called
pamela grasps gingers gnarly arm and squeezes it through her sleeve
brigitte and ginger look at pamelas hand
theres something wrong ginger
he wants to do an ultra sound
pamela dont scare her
how could the cells not be human cells
well send you to somebody else
im sure your fathers right
im just upset
how are you feeling do you feel
lowering her voice no unusual discharge or anything like that
henry brigitte and ginger groan
i worry all right
ive made another appointment with a new doctor
early next month was the earliest he could see you
they all begin eating in silence
except brigitte who gags as henry squirts ketchup all over his stew
trinas body is wrapped in a bedspread and stuffed in a kids wagon
brigitte is keeping a look out looking pale and sickened
grass and dirt spray out of the playhouse
ginger is digging up the ground inside doggie style
she emerges shaking the turf out of her new paw
they struggle to get trina inside but shes already too stiff to bend up
knew we shoulda skipped dinner
can we do it my way now
brigitte hesitates her anxieties rising
so is this it
you doin people now
she wont fit unless i you know what i mean
i dint kill her
but were you gonna
there is a long pause
ginger tries to laugh it off with no
im not doing people
brigitte takes a deep breath nodding
she acts belief
ginger drags a section of the body into the playhouse with her
disgusting gnashing and tearing bones snapping and other sounds of devouring are heard from within
brigitte keeps watch
tears appear in her eyes
the body is dragged another foot into the playhouse
ginger is eating trina to make her fit in the grave
trina was dead
trina was dinner
this was bad
ani kept wonderin what sam was doin right then
i couldnt help it he jus kept poppin into my head like
brigitte lifts the lid of a large freezer
our pov is from inside the freezer
its light illuminates the brown paper parcels ginger sets inside next to the frozen waffles and veggies
the parcels are labeled t bone t thigh t breast
what ginger couldnt finish we froze cause the less we left for whoever would find trina the better
watch a lot of crime tv so
brigittes sizing ginger up behind her back
ginger finishes loading the freezer
brigitte drops the lid
the room is dark
ginger is asleep
brigitte is in bed with her back turned to gingers bed
brigitte has a penlight on a collection of open monster books
she is examining a sketch of a plant with yellow flowers
the beast was usually finally eliminated with a bullet the cost of breaking the curse the human life that bore it
however many believed wolfs bane see diagram right had the power not only to protect the innocent but calmed those afflicted to a restored sense of reason and self control
what cha join
brigitte nearly jumps into orbit slamming her book shut as ginger appears over her shoulder
big book of monsters hunh
thought they were useless
rrigitte gives ginger a nervous smile
ginger smiles back
her fangs show
their alarm clock goes off reading am
gingers paw comes down hard on it cracking the plastic casing
brigitte is already up
she sweeps up the glass mess from the night before
ginger rolls out of bed steps over brigitte and stumbles to the bathroom
ginger steps on tacks and doesnt even react
man im not getting enough sleep
ginger closes the bathroom door
brigitte leaps to the door looping one end of a noosed extension cord around the handle
the other end is tied to the door handle of the bedroom door
brigitte checks to ensure the latter is bolted shut
off screen the toilet flushes
off screen ginger tries to open the door
beef brigitte watches the vibrating length of cord hold the door firmly in place
ginger bangs hard on the door
ginger dont be pissed
open the fuckin door you feeb
ginger pounds on the door with great violence
want pamela dc h e
the pounding sto s
we have to stop it ginge

i ll be back before dark
brigitte tears the page with the plant out of her book and leaves by the window
told pammy ginger wasnt feeling well
just to get her checkin regular on
her keep the pressure on ginger to be cool
brigitte steps off a county bus at the drive
theres a police car parked next to the sams truck
she looks back to the bus but the doors swing shut and it pulls away
brigitte smoothes her hair takes a deep breath and over acts innocent as she walks up
brigitte can hear male voices as she minces down the leafy aisles
its in your best interests to be cooperative
my lawyers co operative i just know my rights
i dont know where she is im very concerned
thats it unless you got a warrant
she ends up backing into a cop behind some palms
i mean sorry
to cop you can see i got customers so if thats all
the cop gives sam a final dirty harry squint and leaves
sam collects himself with difficulty
so does brigitte

sam takes it
brigitte yanks her own hair hard
tryin to kill somebody
off her look well you know its poisonous right

anyways theyre perennials only flowers in spring
brigitte turns to leave hot with frustration huinilliation
sam watches her stamp toward the door
ranunculaceae come in about a hundred species
ive gotta cousin monkshood
not so toxic
if youre interested
brigitte stops and considers him
dont know if itd help
they sit together amidst beautiful plants and flowers
picks a tiny purple flower from a bed of young plants and hands it to brigitte
scalled monkshood cause people used to think it kept em pure from dirty thoughts
make my life easier
surprised by this brigitte smiles and hides under her hair
this is awful
but the whole time i was with him there
i dint even think how id just put pieces of his girlfriend in the deep freeze like at all
ginger pulls with all
her might to get the door open a few inches
the door knobs on both doors are straining
something starts to crack
with ferocious effort ginger contorts herself through two inches of space
the cracking is coming from ginger as she squeezes her body bizarre ly out of joint as a contortionist might
once through she snaps and clicks her distended bones back in place
she gasps for breath
her face is distorted with murderous fury
there is a knock on the bedroom door
ginger feeling any better
ginger climbs noiselessly out of the window
pamela o s ginger
god i hate this lock i know its privacy but what if you were in trouble in there for gods sake
brigitte stands at her on locker tying a rubber band around stalks of the monkshood
there is a goofy half smile on her face and shes humming
the book said dry it out before using it
i figured id keep ginger locked up feeding her trina till it was ready
she hangs the monkshood upside down in the locker
the buzzer goes as she slams the door shut
ginger stalks past the neighbors yard with the playhouse where trina is buried
a new puppy romps
he sniffs around the edge of the playhouse
he smells something
he starts to whine and dig
ginger stomps the deserted halls with their class schedule in hand
classes are in session
a fat silhouette appears at the end of the corridor
my office ginger faces him with a dreadful expression
brigitte slumps in her seat doodling
the rcmp officer is back speaking to the class
the poster this time has a class photo of trina
if any of you have seen trina please let us know
she went for a run this morning and has not returned or contacted her family or friends
ginger stands imposingly over mr
wayne in his chair
sit down ginger
i cant stay
i said sit
an i said
cutting her off you are expelled
this is not your personal playground this is a school
gingers good hand lifts the telephone receiver on mr
with her wolfen paw she dials
in the background we see blood splattered over the walls
imitating pamela hello main office
this is mrs
would you page my daughter brigitte please
im waiting to meet her in the guidance office
thank you so much
brigitte catches herself writing sams name on her binder
she scribbles it out looking very guilty
would brigitte fitzgerald please report to guidance
the cop the teacher the whole class look at her
brigitte scoops up her stuff
brigitte reaches the door and finds it locked
the door opens a crack and gingers transformed arm grabs brig
ille hauling her inside
the door slams shut and locks
dont ever fuck with me like that again
brigitte gapes at all the blood
ginger is very agitated
he asked for it
was gonna expel me
backing away brigitte trips over mr
waynes foot sticking out from under the desk
what do we do bee
what do we do
brigitte sinks into a chair looking completely traumatized
ginger hops about charged by the kill
cmon we need a fuckin plan here
the school bell goes off
brigitte snaps out of her daze reaches up and hits the light switch off
they now sit in virtual darkness
wait till everyone goes
well stuff him someplace
clean this up
the sound of the full halls around them seems very loud now
bee gotta a smoke
brigitte hands her a smoke
sorry about this
dont be mad kay
im not mad
the school is deserted
the lock pops on the guidance door and brigitte and ginger peer out
lock the door
ill knock once
brigitte slips out and creeps down the corridor
ginger shuts the door
then ginger whips it open again
shut the door ginger
brigitte blinks at her then continues to skulk away
the office door shuts and the lock locking reverbs after her
brigitte walks fast looking for a place for the body
she looks inside full garbage cans and sizes them up
she looks up at a loose ceiling panel
she jumps a few times trying to reach it
she gets an idea
brigitte jogs past the sign directing us to gym
a janitor pushes his cart toward the guidance office
he stops at another door produces keys and lets himself in
he returns with a trash can and empties into his bin
he replaces the can closes the door and locks it
ginger gnaws on mr
waynes arm but really isnt enjoying it
she stops in mid chew and listens
the janitors footsteps approach his cart wheels squeak the janitor wheels up to the guidance office
he slides this key in the lock
ginger grips the door knob as best she can with her one good hand her feet braced against the wall on either side
on the other side the janitor tugs and tugs again
gingers getting madder the more he persists
the janitor gives the door one last wrench and it flies open
brigitte wheels a large cloth cart full of basket balls around a corner
the janitor crawls toward her his hands lifted to her for help blood spurting from his slashed throat
he tries to cry out but only makes a gurgling whistle the air in his qi s passing through blood
ginger walks behind him as he crawls
ginger applies her boot to his ass and makes him slip face first in his own gore
ginger looks up and sees brigitte gaping in utter revulsion at her
for a split second ginger stops cold
ginger seems to falter before her sisters horror
then without breaking their locked gaze without even seeming conscious shes doing it ginger steps on the mans fingers and breaks them with a series of snaps
brigitte tries to pry her eyes away but cant
still staring at brigitte ginger extends her claws
ginger shakes her head as if to say i cant help it
ginger pounces on the man
brigitte turns her face to the wall
the lanitor makes a final horrible noise
the halls fall silent
as brigitte stuffs mr
wayne into the gym basket and covers him with balls ginger runs madly up and down the halls screeching and whooping slamming her monster arm into the lockers bashing them
as brigitte pushes the janitors body into a ground level air ginger breaks the fire extinguisher out of its case and unleashes foam into the halls
ginger snaps walton july brigitte mops up the janitors blood with his own cart stuff
the guidance office is already clean
ginger lifts the fire extinguisher over her head
she starts running with it toward through the frosted glass window of the main office with a triumphant war whoop
brigitte steps between ginger and her target
ginger throws the canister any way forcing brigitte to dive out of the way
glass rains down over
brigitte lifts her head in time to see ginger burn down the hall looking for more mischief
brigitte curls into a fetal position burying her face in her lap and rocks herself
off screen we hear ginger cont
inuing her ram a e else where in the school
brigitte wanders up to the janitors cart looking like a plane crash survivor dazed and wretched
brigitte picks up a bottle of cleaning fluid
she sniffs it
she closes her eyes and tips it back
she washes it around in her mouth and lifts her chin to swallow
she spews it into the air the taste making her heave instinctively
she dry heaves a couple of times
she throws the bottle at the wall
exhausted brigitte trails ginger who is tired too and heading for the exit
they stop dead at the doors
a trucks headlights pin them in full view
ginger rolls her sleeve down over her paw
brigitte swoons as if she might black out on the spot
the trucks engine cuts and the doors slowly open
well well well
ginger snaps walton jufy jason and his pals climb out of the van
they hold beer bottles they have come here to drink
the fair sisters fitzgerald

he extends his hand to shake on it
linger shakes it awkwardly with her good hand
brigitte thumps her head against the wall
ginger leans on the bathroom door which is shut
brigitte is sitting on the closed seat of the toilet trying to pull her hair out
shut up leave me alone
its not that big a deal
how can you say that
two people are dead because of you
they pissed me off
brigitte opens the bathroom door

ginger prods a claw into brigittes chest pinning her in place

i think yer sooo jealous
yeah im jealous yer turning into a nympho
im so jealous yer killing people who did never did nothing to you
brigitte takes a deep breath swallows hard
i dont wanna do this any more
gingers claw pricks brigittes skin
blood appears around the claw
im sorry but
brigitte writhes in pain as gingers claw slices in deeper
this is me
ginger retracts the claw and brigitte grabs the wound
ginger hurls brigitte against the wall
ginger throws herself on top of brigitte
ginger raises her killing claw to bri g
e s neck
who needs you
brigitte is helpless and looks terrified
gingers face is contorted with intensity with madness
a drip of gob drops onto brigittes face
very small ginger
ginger lifts brigitte by the shirt front and searches her eyes
ginger drops brigitte to the floor and grabs her coat
brigitte grabs gingers leg
brigitte struggles to hang on to rise from the floor gingers really hurt her
maybe we can stop it
ginger kicks free
an spoil my fun
ill skin you alive first
brigitte struggles to a point between ginger and the window
youre fucked without me
theyll catch you
no you wake up
nobodyll live to catch me
yer a two faced lil chicken shit
your problem brigitte
i dont need ya
i dont wantcha
so stay away from me or ill kill you i swear ill have you for breakfast
brigitte backs out of gingers way
ginger steps up i
o the window and climbs through
brigitte rubs her throat trying hard to keep breathing
brigitte dashes to her own bed and drags an adidas gym bag from under it
brigitte starts grabbing clothes off the floor and jamming them into the bag
i was like okay
fuck you too
shed be sorry
and id be like i dunno somewheres totally else goin not my problem
brigitte trudges up to the bus stop next to the fence of the playhouse yard with her full adidas bag
light streams from inside the yard multi coloured strobing
it looks like a ufo has landed on the other side of the fence
she peers through the slats
she sees the playhouse lit up like a christmas tree
she sees gloved hands and police uniforms
then sliding past the long almost endless shape on a stretcher being drawn out of the playhouse theyve found trinas body
the bus appears approaching from way down the road
brigitte looks from it to the crime scene
the crime scene photographers flash
pops in brigittes face blinding her for a second
brigitte rubs her eyes
she shakes her head hard
the bus is indicating slowing to pull over
brigitte opens her eyes
the bus is almost here
brigitte grips her adidas bag
but you cant break up with blood
you cant divorce yer sister
you jus cant
the bus passes obscuring brigitte from view as its body fills frame
when its tail lights pass brigitte is far down the street running like a champion in the direction she came from
brigitte carefully unlocks the bedroom door and slowly opens it
the room is dark and just as she left it
gingers hed has not been slept in and she is no where to be seen
id get the monkshood from my locker at school the next morning
brigitte creeps to the bathroom and snaps the light on
id find ginger id find out if the stuff even worked
brigitte locks the window shut
she locks the bedroom door and pushes a bureau of drawers in front of it
i could deal with whatever as long as i tried
if it was the last thing she ever saw me do it was gonna be me goin fer somethin by myself
the real ginger woulda dug that large
brigitte turns on the bedside lamp and fishes a baseball bat out of the closet
i would try to save my sister when the sun came up
you know if the sun came up
brigitte climbs into bed snuggling the bat in with her
she lights a smoke
she finds the feminine hygiene calendar on the bedside table next to the photo of the girls as kids at halloween taken many years before
the calendar tells us it is about to be friday
friday is the full moon
friday is halloween
the lamp is still on
the ash tray is full of butts
brigitte stirs in her sleep
ginger stands at the end of brigittes bed staring at her
brigitte snaps to gripping the bat
ginger snorts and climbs into her own bed
brigitte swings her gaze to the window
it is still shut and locked
the bureau is still in front of the door
brigitte holds her hat tightly and watches her sisters back in the next bed terrified
brigitte jogs up to the school
the yard is full of students
teachers are marshaling them into lines and seating them on the grass
brigitte plows through
ginger rides past piggy backed by jason
ginger completely ignores brigitte
brigitte looks very worried
ginger fitzgerald is such a slut
you hear about trina sinclair
dug her up in somebodys back yard
oh thats so sad
poor trina ga awd
as brigitte gets closer to the building she finds police cars and cops at the main entrance
principal fardor is speaking with the rcmp constable who has been visiting classes
fardor holds a hanky over his face
that stench near the staff offices what is that you think
brigitte hedges up the steps toward the door
i couldnt say sir
now is there anyone you suggest we talk to
anyone with something against the school
brigitte slips past the two men
for gods sake look around you
i got angry young people bored blind
helluva day for my goddamn cleaning staff to be late
brigitte stops at the threshold
the hell you goin
i left something in my locker
find your homeroom and wait
schools outta bounds until we call you in
brigitte backs down the steps looking like she just took a good slap
she turns to confront the mass confusion around her
brigitte spots ginger dancing on the roof of a car in the lot now surrounded by boys
brigitte spots sams truck near by
sam is sit in his truck slumped over the wheel
he holds an almost gone bottle of rye
brigitte runs up
sam is crying
he doesnt see brigitte arrive at his window so she turns to tip toe away
sam looks up
his eyes tell us hes stoned
brigitte stops and turns to face him
sam dries his face on his sleeve and pops his passenger door
brigitte looks around and slides in
ginger is watching brigitte out of the corner of her eye
i showed up to see trina
but shes im goin strange in the head
brigitte doesnt know what to say so she offers his a smoke
he takes it
why would ya do a thing like that
brigitte examine his
face for an implication
there isnt one
whats unny is i dumped her that night
feel bad about it now
truth is she was a pain in the ass
i sound like a jerk right
yeah well while she was disappearin im off have a time at the highway home with my buddy georgio

brigitte raises a hand to touch him chickens out and then scores on the second attempt
he rolls right into her arms
for a brief moment brigitte has her nose in his hair her cheek on his shoulder her hands on his back
hes crying and she fights her own tears
sorry this is strange
i dont even
last time i saw her she was so mad at me
an we did have some times we did
makes me sick what her last thought a me musta been though
their eyes meet their faces are inches apart
brigitte kisses him very softly and very quickly and then pulls out
sam looks shocked
brigitte looks more shocked
ginger stops dancing a second
she is staring at brigitte and sam in his truck
her face darkens
im really um
sam leans in and kisses her right back
i shouldnt well
but that was really nice
they sit staring straight ahead a moment
a cop ahead double takes them and reaches into his car for the radio mic

ginger snaps walton july brigitte

brigitte drags her hands over her face with extreme anxiety
gingers yer sister right
sam grimaces as brigitte nods
oh rumors say shes doin all these guys at some party
goias around shes a big time ho that kinder thing

nobody mentioned you
gingers most maniacal laugh drifts over to them
brigitte sees her dancing sexily on the roof of a car with a whole crowd of leering boys
take it off

ginger stops dancing
anger floods her face
you know about that
ginger snaps walton july

sam grabs brigitte

brigitte slips out of the truck as they stare at one another with that look you get when youre scared because you just kissed someone you really really like
two more squad cars are gliding up the street toward the school
brigitte makes her way toward ginger
fie was jus drunk im thinkin
i mean he probly dint mean it
beyond sams truck behind brigitte the two new cruisers lurch to a stop
cops approach sams vehicle with extreme caution
brigitte arrives at the car with ginger as all a you guys
very sinister i wanna party with everybody
well do it till you drop
the crowd applauds
brigitte stares at ginger like shes watching a cruise missile coming in
ginger notices brigitte watching her
ginger pretends she doesnt see her
ginger was gonna kill every one of l em
a commotion behind them causes everyone to turn
sam is being dragged from his truck by the cops
he is flung face first onto the hood and hand cuffed
youre under arrest for the murder of trina sinclair
brigitte physically fights with herself not to yell out
she runs a few steps toward sam
brigitte looks back at ginger who drills her with an evil warning glare
the cops shove sam into the back of a cruiser
they roar off
brigitte stands alone apart from the crowd
the cruisers flashing lights disappear down the street
brigitte turns to face ginger mustering her own first menacing look
ginger accepts a cigarette offered by one of her boys
they closed the school that day
so i never got to my locker
so i never got the monkshood
i thought this is it
i fucked up
the full moon is just making an appearance
brigitte stands in the front room window which is decorated with a happy halloween paper sign and plastic bats
brigittes watching henry put styrofoam tombstones in the front yard
the fitzgerald family is eating
brigitte pokes at her food
ginger eats like a fiend with sunglasses on
her monster arm has been wrapped in gauze from tip to elbow
now just remember no boys in you bedroom during this party
your room is off limits
ginger are you sure that arms not sprained or worse
mm henry whend you get this new meat from tinnys
brigitte and ginger exchange a look
i havent been to tinnys
then wheres all the packs marked t come from
brigitte spits out her food
i be excused
brigitte is using the vehicles portable phone as she eyes the silhouettes of the family still at the dining table in the window above her
she stares at her watch during the following do you need fire ambulance or police please
speaking very sam mcdonald is not the beast of bailey downs
he was at the highway home motel when trina sinclair was killed
sam didnt do it
brigitte whips the phone shut hanging up
she breathes out long and slow
in case this was the last thing id do
i wanned sam out of it
sam shouldnt suffer
brigitte hovers in the door way
henry is reading the paper
that sinclair girl was found at the bernsteins can you believe it
what last night
i didnt hear a thing
never going to have these done in time
pamela is feverishly creating little straw witches and such party decorations
she has a se ecl
on of dried flowers wheat etc on the table before her
brigitte honey were thrilled you two are making friends
but next time you two do something like this give mummy a little more notice will you
hate having to scramble
brigitte slides into her regular chair and props her hands on her wrists in an attitude of complete distraction
whats your sister up to
brigitte looks at henry as he works on a little witch
she said she had a lot of work to do on her costume
should we dress up you think
he sifts through the dried plants before them
brigitte double takes the pile
youre no fun at all
brigitte sits bolt up right in her seat
what is this stuff
just weeds old cuttings from the yard
no this stuff
brigitte plucks out a handful of dried plant with tiny purple flowers
oh i had that around the dahlias
man at the greenhouse said itd keep the cats out
seemed to do the job
its got a funny name nuns robe priest hat something monkshood
do we have a budding botanist in the family
pamela giggles as does henry
brigitte grabs a fistful of monkshood and races for the door
hey we need that
but brigitte is gone
that was my accent colour
the half finished basement has a rec room which pamela has decked out in an infantile version of ghoulish for the party
punch sits ready next to case lot pop and tupperware brimming with snacks
ginger snaps walton july
brigitte walks through to the door with a sign off limits
brigitte unlocks the door and slips the monkshood up her shirt
candles are burning all over
gingers bed is turned down ready
brigitte walks in on jason climbing through the open window
must be the place right
brigitte sneers at him
he holds a half gone bottle of schnapps a dress shirt and his good jeans on
the toilet flushes in the john
brigitte knocks on the door
the bathroom door unlocks but
git in here an gimme a hand
brigitte casts an uncertain look at jason
cmon ladies theres six other guys sitting in the shrub waiting
brigittes face darkens
she slips into the bathroom and shuts the door
do you think some people deserve to die
brigitte does not tryo to hide her fear of being in a confined space with ginger
there are razors and whiskers all over the floor
shaving cream every where
ginger is red faced sweating and hostile
dont say a fuckin word
ginger lowers the towel shes wearing enough to show the bump on her butt is now a twitching tail
take this gauze and tie it flat
ginger you cant brigitte takes the roll of gauze
she grabs the tail between her fingers and coils it up with utter disgust
brigittes hands tremble
jason sits on the edge of gingers bed and bounces up and down a bit
between his legs we glimpse a dog tag hanging between the mattresses
brigitte tapes the gauze in place
ginger throws a robe on and grabs the door
now get outta my life
brigitte grits her teeth
i gotta get ready for the party
then wait here till im done
what through all fifty a them
oh dont tempt me
ginger takes a deep breath before she opens the bathroom door
her breath is ragged
she smoothes her hair and chews her lip
ginger opens the door and closes it behind her
ginger snaps walton july brigitte hears its really dark in here
brigitte puts the toilet seat down and sits on it
brigitte lights a smoke
brigitte withdraws the monkshood from under her shirt and has a good scratch where it was itching her
off screen are the sounds of slurp kisses and jasons moans
a fly unzips
clothes fall with soft plunks to the floor
bed springs creak
plastic condom wrappers crinkle and then the snap whap of one being fitted on pretty roughly
somewhere above them the door bell starts ringing
from a vanity cupboard she pulls a zombie face painting kit and sets it next to the monkshood
cars are streaming down the street in both directions
groups of costumed teenage boys flock down the walks over lawns and que up to get into the fitzgerald party
on their front porch pamela and henry meet and greet the young men awed by their numbers
to pamela notice any girls
brigitte now in zombie face rubs the monkshood between her fingers crumbling it into a neat pile on the counter
off screen from the bedroom the sounds of ginger having rough sex continue
brigitte peels a centimeter of paper off the end of an unlit smoke and wiggles the cigarette creating a second pile of tobacco
she reaches into the radiator vent and withdraws a package of rolling papers
ginger snaps walton july
one boy in a skeleton costume creeps along the shrubs toward the fitzgerald sisters bedroom window
he stumbles over a demon a frankenstein and a mummy
they curse one another
off screen from the rec room part noise grows as things get under way outside
ginger waves good bye to jason as she undoes franks shirt buttons
the bathroom door is now inching open a crack
on the counter at the sink all evidence of brigittes project with the monkshood are gone
brigitte peers out the cracked door and then looks away fighting an urge to watch in spite of being grossed out
the sounds of sex drift in from the bedroom
she catches sight of herself in the mirror
as a zombie
she tugs her shirt tight over her breasts
nothing to see
she smoothes her shirt with her hands then moves her palms down over her waist her hips
over her crotch
brigittes fingers skip under her skirt
brigittes face tells us shes searching for something under there
shes trying this out
but nothings happening
she draws her hands out of her skirt and quickly washes her hands in the sink
she checks her watch and sighs
brigitte creeps out of the bathroom on all fours
above her gingers feet and some guys writhe on the bed
brigitte reaches up to the bedroom door knob
she opens it and crawls out
the rec room is packed with over grown ghouls
pamela is trying to play it cool from her perch behind the punch bowl as she marvels at the costumes and all these kids shes never even
henry has a group of boys cornered with a college football story
brigitte leans against the wall watching the party and looking at her watch
in english i heard about this chick who used a mans name to get her books read
she went by george but she was really mary ann
goes its never too late to be what you might have been
i was jus there thinkin is that true
was it too late to be an unsolved mystery
alls i had to do was walk away
brigitte looks up to see a cheap plastic frankenstein mask looking down at her
its owner flips it up its sam
brigittes eyes snap wide open in shock
they let me go
no evidence someone called in this tip
so i decided to stay
hey you gotta get outta here ginger emerges from the bedroom like a reigning diva and the room stops dead
brigitte drops her glass of punch
ginger has come out as herself as an almost full blown werewolf
she wears a lill red riding hood cape jobbie and a plastic mask
shes the best looking monster you ever laid eyes on
down her belly she has six perfect nipples showing and everything
the room bursts into a cheerinq round of applause
that make up is amazing
ginger it looks totally real
to pamela told you
shes a arts type for chrissakes look at that
shes very good isnt she
to brigitte wow yer sisters gone to town
yeah shes gone all right
can you do me a favor

brigitte shows him what appears to be a joint
sam takes it
dont tell her i gave it to you

she wont take it if its from me
an dont like go any wheres with her
jus come right back kay

brigitte smiles embarrassed and freaking at the exact same time
be right back
ginger snaps walton july
across the densely crowded room sam whispers in gingers ear
ginger smiles and nods and palms something he passes her
ginger glances at brigitte who tries to pretend shes not watching
when brigitte checks again ginger is leading sam by the hand toward her bedroom
sam looks over his shoulder and lifts a finger one second back at brigitte
the bedroom door shuts behind them
brigitte leaps toward the bedroom
someone catches her arm and holds her back
one minute young lady i could use a little help here
let go of me i have to get ginger
i have to get two more veggie trays down those stairs
i think your sister be fine for two minutes
pamela is already marching brigitte up the stairs
brigitte strains to get back
looking between her mother and her closed bedroom door desperately
pamela snags brigitte again as brigitte dumps the veggie tray and tries to get to the bedroom
all these boys came to see you two least you can do is stop hiding in your room
honestly you act like someoned forced this party down your throat
now go be nice
pamela stands between brigitte and the bedroom door her arms folded
you dont understand
yes i do
i was shy too at your age
brigitte backs away with such a dirty look on her face
she turns to confront the eager painted faces around her all desperate for some female attention
brigitte has i want to scream written all over her face
sam pushes ginger away from him
ginger has brigittes gift joint smoldering between her finger tips
ginger is pretty out of it she totters
okay cut it out now
this dopes fucked
makin me blaarrggh

told yer sister id be right back
whats up your ass
dont get mean snothin personal
i happen to think brigittes pretty cool
and leave my baby sister alone
do me dont hurt her
i wont hurt her
now be a good girl and finish up your joint
well fuck you
ginger takes a big toke as she paces between sam and the door
suddenly shes coughing uncontrollably rubbing her eyes wailing in pain
what is this
sam makes a move toward her and ginger blindly lashes out at him
ginger hurls sam into the bed
sams flight path knocks the mattress askew dozens and dozens of dog collars pour out over him
sam fingers one in particular
brigitte sits on the stairs to the main floor cornered by a guy dressed as a cow
something was definitely fucked
brigitte eyes pamela who is slowly being distracted by horny young men who will now dance with anybody even pamela
do you think this is a faggy costume for a guy
you can just say
i dunno i been gettin funny looks
what like we arent advanced enough that a guy can show up completely in the spirit of the thing with an udder an not get treated like a freakin fruit
brigitte looks at her watch
pamela is dragged off into the throng by a band of juveniles singing do the hustle
brigitte makes her move at last
brigitte makes a badly faked would be casual bee line for their bedroom door
brigitte wiggles the knob
brigitte still a zombie unlocks the door and peers in
the light is on in the bathroom the door is ajar
the shower is running
there are a few candles burning in corners
otherwise the room is dark
brigitte steps inside closing the door on the party behind her
she grabs a flashlight and turns it on
the walls are splattered with blood
there is gore on the floor
brigitte plucks the monkshead joint from a pool of bloody goo it is soaked
ginger snaps walton july on the bed sam lays with his shirt off and his fly open
his face is mutilated
hes missing an eye
brigitte creeps toward him
brigitte leaps back
she tries to speak but her voice isnt working
her face transforms from horror to fury
then she heads to bathroom door
brigitte discovers ginger sitting in the tub floor under the running shower weeping
her eyes are swollen
ginger is now covered in coarse hair
the water around her is full of blood
there is a kitchen knife next to her
gingers stoned numb on the monkshood dose
shes groggy and weak
ginger is squeezing her now full tail at its base where the blood is oozing between her f
ginger has tried and tailed to eul her tail off
ginger doesnt move
ginger looks so pathetic its heart breaking
brigitte snatches the knife away and shuts off the water
nobodyll want me now any ways
brigitte takes in the cut the rest of the monstrosity her sister has become
i dont wanna do this any more
brigitte yanks ginger out of the tub and grabs a towel frantic
press this on the cut
ginger snaps walton july ginger does as shes told
brigitte digs out gauze and tape packages
theyre both almost empty theyve used it all up
brigitte throws them on the floor
i missed you bee
brigitte searches gingers face
that you in there
ginger cracks an uncertain pained smile
brigitte does too an exact replica in fact
brigitte gently turns ginger around to try and deal with her tail
ginger is woozy and weak from blood loss
i cant clean this one up
we have to go
like go go
can you do it
im so woozy
brigitte glances out into the bedroom
ever bite something you dint kill
misinterpreting the question hopeful wanna be one with me
tll be right back
sam is fingering his wounds half conscious drooling bile and blood
brigitte still a zombie looms up behind him with her baseball bat
she fishes in his pants pocket and withdraws a set of keys
i really did think you were
so you know whatever
im really sorry i have to
sam moans as his good eye rolls up at her
brigitte blinks away tears and looks away collecting herself
brigitte raises the bat over her head and swings it down as the party is rocking along
pamela knocks on their door
you in there
youre not being very sociable
theres no answer
she tries the knob and is surprised to find it unlocked
she opens the door
she turns on the lights
pamela takes in the bloody muck everywhere
the room is deserted
no sisters fitzgerald
pamela swoons and drops like a deadweight to the floor
henry rushes up looking in over his wifes body
the boys in costume crowd in behind him
pamela honey its just a prank you know how they
he fingers some holy mother of its warm
where are my kids
ginger went in here with sam mcdonald a while back
yeah you know
the guy they thought was the beast but they let im go
henry steps into the room
he spots a bloody trail up to the open ground level window
tires squeal in the street and the county regreening truck lurches out of its parking spot
brigitte still a zombie throws the truck into gear with an amateurs hand
her adidas bag and her jar of two dollar bills is on the seat next to her
ginger is just seen through the grate between the cab and the dark back of the truck
plans plans arc good
course i hardly had one
adrenaline though adrenaline is pretty speedy shit
dont eat the body okay
i got this idea an well need sam
brigitte floors it and the truck blasts down their cul du sac to the main road
the truck speeds down the street a tad erratical ly
sirens rise around it
brigitte slows looking left right and in the side mirrors trying to see where the sirens are coming from
fuck fuck fuck fuck
then suddenly four cop cars blast past them in the opposite direction
heading back to the fitzgerald house
all rightie then
brigitte drives on
what she cannot see behind her in the grate are the glimpses of ginger in the flickering lights of the passing street lamps
her final spurt of transformation is taking place flash
her face is filling in with fur
her eyes glow golden yellow wolfen
her face pulls into a wet snout
a long pink tongue lolls out between glistening white fangs
the truck rolls to the crest of the hill over bailey downs the sight of the bush party
the moon is immense up here
you could almost touch it
brigitte eases the truck to the edge of the hill
the lights of the homes below them creep into view
theyll think that sam took us from our room right
cause of his record an the arrest right
were gonna make this look like he did any ways
he got us maybe killed us took our bodies to do some unspeakable thingy
sam killed himself
ginger doesnt answer
so boom diversion
meanwhile you an me hit the highway
we can hitch get you cleaned up
by the time the find out we werent in sams clutches at all we could be any wheres
ginger doesnt answer
brigitte puts the brake on but does not cut the engine
brigitte climbs out of the cab
she moves to the back doors of the truck and opens them
in the inky darkness inside she hears heavy panting
cmon we got move
shove sam down here
brigitte climbs up into the truck reaching for something on its floor
brigitte f itids sams prone feet
an animal ginger launches out at her knocking her back out clear of the truck
ginger isnt ginger any more what we can glimpse in the darkness is an attack by a creature much like the one that bit ginger
and its attacking brigitte
brigitte flails kicks and punches at it
she breaks free and clambers at the tool rack on the inside panel of the truck
she grabs a shovel as the creature comes snarling up at her
i mean it
it lunges at her again and brigitte clocks it
it slides dazed off the back of the truck to the ground
brigitte drags sams body into the front seat
she sets her adidas bag on the gas pedal
she releases the brake
the truck rolls forward
off the top of the hill
brigitte watches as it crashes down down rolling and twisting into the suburb below
it lands in a heap and bursts into flames
brigitte returns to where it ginger was last seen on the ground
the shovel and blanket are there
a bloody pool trails off into the woods
brigitte hefts the shovel warily shoulders the blanket and follows the wetness shining in the moonlight
leave a fuckin trail much
could leave everybody a fuckin map
tense seconds pass as she searches through the scrub and trees shovel ready
we can hear panting and growling
i wont hurt you if you dont hurt me
brigitte spots something ahead and lowers the shovel as she approaches it
it ginger cowers in the brush collapsed
her head and tail are bleeding
brigitte drops to her knees nest to her sister frantic with grief
i didnt mean it ginger is gasping fading
her eyes start rolling back in her head
brigittes hand is shaking as it reaches out but cant touch her
ginger licks brigittes fingers slowly
brigitte buries her face in gingers ruff moaning
you cant you cant were out
you cant dont dont do this to me
look look its all taken care of
were unsolved mysteries
the sunrise has the sky this bloody red
brigitte drags ginger a few feet past a sign next to the road thank you for visiting bailey downs
we made it out
there was this road
an the space between here and where ever
i did it
brigitte opens the blanket
ginger has returned to human form
because ginger is dead
in a small grove of trees brigitte pushes the last pile of dirt over gingers shallow grave
brigitte wipes her caked hands off in the dewy grass
beneath the dirt and dried blood she finds puncture wounds
brigitte looks to camera
she rolls her eyes wearily
brigitte stands and heads to the side of the road
a semi appears on the horizon coming her way
brigitte lifts her thumb
the semis turn indicator comes on as it slows and veers to arrive before her
roll tail credits as excerpts from an episode of the television program unsolved mysteries roll
it tells the story of the mysterious disappearance of two teenage girls sisters who disappeared under strange circumstances in the normally quiet suburb of bailey downs
brigitte and ginger look a likes re enact the summarized events of their flight from justice
the cops figured out their faked deaths of course
henry and pamela have reportedly denied comment
it is seen from the communitys perspective as two delusional young women gone totally wrong a grotesque tragedy of youth wasted by mental illness
no one can explain though the non human blood trails leaving the scene of their last crime
at the segments close and the credits roll
out we see the traditional high school photos of brigitte and ginger
brigitte and ginger fitzgerald are considered armed and dangerous
if you see these two young women or have any information on their whereabouts please contact crimestoppers or your local detachment of the rcmp
