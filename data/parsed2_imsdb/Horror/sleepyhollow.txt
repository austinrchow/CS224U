sleepy hollow early by andrew kevin walker sleepy hollow being the true storie of one ichabod crane and the headless horseman kevin yagher and andrew kevin walker based on the
legend of sleepy hollow by washington irving screenplay by andrew kevin walker third draft a pleasing land of drowsy head it was of dreams that wave before the half shut eye
an ugly man charges through on a horse holding a lantern forward on a long pole
he looks back terrified
sleepy hollow new york thunderous hoofbeats are heard behind
the ugly man glances back again
his lantern swings wild
shatters against a tree
the jammed up pole slams the ugly man off his horse
he hits the ground
he runs trips falls and scrambles up
deep in the forest we glimpse the source of the hoofbeats a huge form on a huge black horse already gone
the ugly man pushes through thorny bushes
jagged branches slit his hands and cheeks
he bursts from the briar patch and tumbles to a trail
he lifts his bloodied face
in the forest behind the hooves of the black horse rip underbrush
a spur digs into the snorting steeds already bleeding flank
the pursuers gloved hand draws a sword blade ringing
on the trail the ugly man runs on
the shrill whistle of a sword swing is heard as the pursuer blurs past
the ugly man is still running when his head lolls back at an impossible angle
tumbles off his shoulders
his headless body hits the dirt
empty cobblestone streets
a rapidly clanging bell breaks the silence from afar
new york city two constables clamor round a corner lanterns held high listening
they rush into an alleyway
elsewhere piers border the hudson river
the bell is louder
the two constables arrive searching
no one around
constable one hefts his pistol scared
where are you
mans voice o
they hurry to the rivers edge
down a hill the man another constable stands with his back to us
hes waist deep in water tossing away his alarm bell
i need your help with this
constable two crosses on the peir above
constable one moves forward wary
the man grunts lifting something
is that you
the man turns
meet ichabod crane handsome eyes piercing
yes it is me
but not only me
lifting struggling i found someone here
he drags a bloated male corpse up from the murky water
someone quite dead
the elderly high constable lifts a blanket off the corpse on a wheelbarrow manned by constable two
a snobby magistrate looks disgusted
constable one and ichabod wait
constable two wheels the corpse inside
just a moment
if i may
it is possible this man was murdered
anyone could see
there are surgical ways of telling how he died
by the water in his lungs
ichabod follows the high constable and magistrate in
constable two wheels the body ahead past many booking tables
a jailer moves to unlock a massive door
he will be burned pursuant to statutes of health
i could determine if he were dead before he went into the hudson
must we again hear these heretical rantings
yes must we
there is nothing heretical about science sir
the chinese have written on it for hundreds of years
procedural study used to solve seemingly unsolvable crimes
the door is opened
the corpse again leads the way
a two tiered prison alive with moans of agony and cries of insanity
cells are full of wretched men in chains and iron gags
many are against the bars watching
our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence but if we were more often able to ensure justice after the fact then criminals would truly have something
to fear from law enforcement
have they nothing to fear presently
without disrespect look around you
motioning to cells we overflow
as do our courts
and with disrespect constable if jails and courts overflow it is testimony to success not failure
but how many innocents rot here
and how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets
the high constable reaches a desk taking a seat
guards wait to process beaten bloody prisoners
very few if any
even though i have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused often quite literally
for one who calls himself a federalist your mouth reeks of republican liberalism
to high constable um sir
might i suggest
the magistrate whispers in the high constables ear
ichabod notices with worry that constables one and two wheel the corpse onwards into another room
the magistrate finishes
the high constable smiles faintly
to ichabod there is a farming community upstate constable
ten days journey north in the hudson highlands
it is named sleepy hollow
within a fortnight three persons have been murdered there
each with their head lopped cleanly off
holds up papers the elders of the hollow have sent dispatches to me requesting assistance and now just this very moment i have chosen you
these methods of yours
there has been no practical application
not for lack of trying
and so you take your experimentations to sleepy hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place
bring him here to face our good justice
will you do this for me
swallowing doubt i shall gladly
then you are excused till morning
ichabod moves away heading to where the corpse was taken
oh and constable
off ichabods look do make certain that you meet with success
perhaps you should not come back at all
the high constable smiles a sardonic smile
the corpse burns in a raging furnace
constable one pumps bellows which fan the flames
ichabod steps from darkness nearby
he watches with bitter regret as the corpse is consumed
market town streets bustle
pigs roam free
decorated in early american mad scientist books papers and jars of chemicals
charts of anatomy above a small bed
such a day for such a sad farewell
but this is goodbye my sweet
at the window ichabod holds a bird cage with a red cardinal inside
he opens the cage
the bird flies free
ichabod watches it go then looks down
a coach halts in the street below
the forlorn driver looks up
ichabod absently studies his hands touching the strange scars on both palms evenly dispersed tiny dots of tissue
ichabod lifts a leather satchel checking its contents
two families of migrant workers travel a path leading over burdened horses
ichabods coach approaches from the other direction
ichabod looks out unnerved
one gaunt man watches ichabod pass
there is a dead worried look in the mans eyes
others stare at ichabod
ichabod faces two massive vine covered pillars unsure
he turns to watch the driver lead the coach away
ichabod walks between the pillars to a long straight road
he does not notice above three dead ravens hang from a tree limb twine wrapped round their necks
ichabod walks on with baggage
the square is empty a church and graveyard at one end
the road ahead is bordered by businesses and homes
conversation drifts from a tavern
a criminal sits in stocks
a quiet crying is heard
he looks for its source
its from a window above louder
sounds like the sobbing of an old woman
a belltower stands tall like a mast pole with a crows nest basket atop
theres a man in the basket and a huge bell
ichabod ponders this as he continues
ahead on a hill the grand van tassel manor house
many children in a circle taunt a blindfolded young woman spun round by the handsome barrel chested man brom van brunt
a few young men and ladies watch
brom releases the woman
everyone quiets and avoids her searching hands
this is such a silly game
be a sport and stop complaining
the woman moves to broms voice
he backs away flanked by peers glenn and theodore
ichabod enters clearing his throat
no one notices
the blindfolded woman keeps grasping
one little girl sees ichabod and goes to him finger to her lips
she tugs him
before ichabod can protest he is placed in the blindfolded womans grip
there i have someone
am i finished
you have to tell who it is
the woman touches ichabods face
he is uncomfortable affected by this caress
brom watches jealously
at least make a guess
i dont know
is it brom bones
excuse me miss
takes her hands they have a laugh at your expense
she takes the kerchief off to reveal a stunning beauty katrina van tassel
ichabod tries to compose himself
forgive me i didnt know
i am looking for baltus van tassel
we havent heard your name yet friend
well unless your name is baltus you should not worry over mine
brom grabs ichabods collar pissed
you need some manners
brom looks at her then reluctantly releases ichabod
mans voice o
what is this then
baltus van tassel has entered a working class aristocrat
lady van tassel stands behind a mix of home spun wife and well kept lady
can i help you sir
ichabods relieved to have a proper focal point
children gather around katrina and hide behind her
i have been sent from the city with a letter of introduction
i am told you offer me room and board
ichabod hands over papers
baltus reads furrows his brow
if we could speak alone
nods looks to katrina this is not a time for frivolity katrina is it
am i mistaken
theyre only children father
baltus snorts then exits with ichabod
the others huddle to gossip except katrina who moves beside lady van tassel to watch ichabod and baltus walk down the hall
doctor lancaster dour and always sweaty takes a seat by the fire joining baltus and three other elders
a pretty servant sarah brings a pipe cradle while lady van tassel sets down food
ichabod is standing
that will be all ladies
waits as they exit we are joined by doctor thomas lancaster constable
and to his left are clergyman steenwyck and our able magistrate samuel philipse both keeping order in their own ways
philipse is youngest eyes bloodshot mug in hand and pipe in mouth
clergyman steenwyck is formidably built wearing a constant look of disapproval
i myself am in charge of financial matters and the regulation of currency in our commonwealth
and lastly this fine fellow is james hardenbrook our notary
hardenbrook is oldest ancient with one eye pale and blind
an honor gentlemen
in time i will need every detail of the three murderings youve had but for now i ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the
killer might be
i say is there any one person suspect in these acts
i was afraid of this
philipse shoots a look to baltus
angst amongst the elders
are you aware
to be honest you are not what we expected
we sent for the militia
why not tell us what you have heard
how much have your superiors bothered to tell you
all i know is three are slain their heads found severed from their bodies
the heads were not found severed
the heads were not found at all
withered hardenbrook leans forward his voice cragged
taken by the headless horseman
taken back to hell
you have not been well informed of our troubles sir
if you would
baltus gestures for ichabod to sit
baltus lights his pipe
he was a hessian mercenary sent to our shores by german princes to help keep americans under the thumb of england
however unlike his compatriots who came as muscle in trade for currency he came willingly
for love of carnage
the hessian horseman rides his black steed into a gory close quarters clash his cloaked uniform adorned with edged weapons
he cuts down americans left and right
he was infamous for taking his horse daredevil hard into battle
chopping off heads at full gallop
he dismounts hoisting a battle axe
with sword and axe he annihilates
just to look on him made your blood run cold for he had filed down his teeth to rapiers
to add to the ferocity of his appearance
the horseman lets out a war cry
cannons can be heard booming from afar
daredevil lies dead in red snow
follow footprints away
he would not finally meet his end till the winter of seventy nine when new york city was held by henry clinton and washington occupied west point
it was between those two places not far from here
the horseman flees cloak flowing chased by five rag tag revolutionary soldiers
ahead a steep rocky area prevents escape
soldier one aims a rifle and fires
blood explodes from the horsemans arm as he runs
his sword falls from his now functionless hand
soldier two grabs the sword
at the rocks the horseman faces the men
another rifleman raises his rifle
the horseman reaches over his shoulder to grasp a sheathed knife throws thock
the rifleman jerks back knife in his eye socket
the horseman readies an axe
the revolutionaries move in with swords
they battle steel against steel
the horseman fends off blows from all sides
soldier three lunges stabs his blade deep into the horsemans side
the horseman roars brings his axe down
breaks the sword at the hilt
an upwards stroke sends soldier three head over heels in a fountain of blood
the horseman staggers howling trying to pull the blade from his ribs
the remaining soldiers close in
pipe smoke wafts from philipses mouth
cut off his head with his own sword
its a legend told for twenty years
but only recently has the headless hessian been seen prowling the hollow in search of a head to suit his shoulders
just a moment
sits back incredulous are you saying it is he
aggravated loud when a goblin leaps from the nether world others follow
poltergeists of the air water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations
hardenbrook bangs his cane on a table
baltus puts a calming hand on senile hardenbrooks shoulder
no one knows why he chose to now to climb out from his grave
it is very clear why
citizens here have long tried to hide sins behind closed doors
their failed faith has saturated the soil and called forth one of satans own
excuse me gentlemen but
who has seen this horseman
then name one person who has seen him with their own eyes
a long wait
no reply from the elders
while i will do everything i can to find your assassin i will look for a man of flesh and blood
not some goblin demon from hell
the belltower is covered in defensive spikes
a man climbs down a rope ladder
below many armed men gather
philipse moves to the center on horseback
gather and quiet
the hour has come to choose for this night
each mans name is in this box and has been checked
a box is handed up
ichabod and baltus arrive on foot at the back of the mob
at a nearby forest men light torch posts in a line bordering the forest edge for at least a half mile
philipse draws a folded paper from the box holds it up
may the lord watch over him
unfolds paper jonathan masbath
are you here
i take my responsibility
the crowd parts as jonathan masbath a dirt poor farmer with a bow and quiver of arrows moves forward
his son young masbath grips his arm
up to philipse hes already been up once
why does he go again
it is a lottery son
it just as easily might have been one of them
i go with you
you obey my wishes
looks to crowd brom
look after him will you
brom steps up nodding
jonathan kisses his sons cheek then heads to the rope ladder
men pat him on the back
someone leave him a horse
young masbath watches his father go
brom coaxes him away
at the back of the crowd ichabod watches skeptically looks to young masbath as he and brom pass
you worry for naught little man
nothing will harm him there
looks up sotto it is problems here on the ground you people need begin to worry about
ichabod watches jonathan climb very high above
ichabod makes notations in a ledger book
you will dream
katrina strolls in sits on the bed
ichabod is nervous
did they tell
it is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone
according to the elders an indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken and spells cast then still linger to this day
do you often make a habit of sitting on strange mens beds
you are horribly old fashioned arent you
feel free to form your own opinion
facing his ledger though it appears you already have
well i intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend brom van brunt but it seems ive made matters worse
getting up to go ill leave you to your business
i should apologize
have no great love of
it might have been more
might have been positively grand talk
ichabod offers his chair backing away
seeing it is the only one he remains standing
is it me or are you this nervous around all women
perhaps it is because your suitors hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat
the massive fellow
for someone you call friend he misplaces a good portion of jealousy
he has proposed to me twice
which may explain his temperament
to have asked twice means the answer was no at least once
katrina looks down discards this with a smile
ive read a great deal about your new york city
do be a dear and tell me all about it
sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life
extra ordinary yes
but first you tell me about the headless horseman
the torches burn bright
above in the belltower jonathan masbath loads a rifle
jonathan stands looking to a sky that is all stars and moon
a horse is heard shrieking
below the horse tied at the base of the tower is spooked
a commotion is heard ground rumbling
jonathan grips a rifle cocks it and moves to look
at the forest edge a herd of deer stampedes out
they sprint past the tower and across the field
jonathan crosses to watch the herd scatter
he crosses back to peer at the forest
a thick fog creeps from the woods
as the fog overtakes the base of each torch a tentacle of mist snakes up to the flame killing it
all along the forest arms of vapor snuff torches
one by one by one
above jonathan sights the rifle along the trees
come out devil
ichabod leans on a dresser
katrinas still seated
not all think it is the horseman
many say witches come from the western woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons
some believe a person in this very town kneels before lucifer offering death as tribute
and still others believe none of it
are you so superstitious
to call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic but not all magic is black
there is no such thing as magic
what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom or even in a teardrop
poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions
laughs you are funny
ichabod doesnt get whats so funny about that
the distant toll of a bell is heard
katrina looks fearful
she goes to open a window
the bell tolls
tolls mournfully over farms and forests
tolls as a man comes from his barn listening then sprinting towards his home
tolls across the deserted square
windows go dark
shutters are slammed shut
ichabod bounds out to the lawn halting to listen
katrina and baltus come out on the porch
constable where are you going
ichabod chases away
come back sir
watches him go madness
baltus ushers katrina back in
the door slams
ichabod charges across the rocky field
he slows awed
the belltower is down its mast is splintered
the horse is gone
ichabod moves to where the crows nest lies smashed
no sign of jonathan
jonathan runs past gripping his bow
till hoofbeats are heard in pursuit
trees are silhouetted against the sky
as hoofbeats get louder branches bend like arms and fingers yearning to touch
as hoofbeats roar past the trees relax
further on jonathan runs
wind begins to blow
behind in motion we see daredevils snorting visage eyes lizard like with vertical slits literally aglow
the horsemans hand yanks a wooden war hammer from a saddle mount
no clear view of the horseman
closing in on jonathan
jonathan is overtaken
the horseman swings the hammer whoomp sends jonathan sprawling
jonathan tries to get up but pain shoots through him
he crawls to retrieve his bow
against a tree he takes an arrow from his shoulder quiver and readies it
a metal tapping is heard o
jonathan pulls the bow taut pained lips bloody
elsewhere daredevil approaches slow
the horseman taps his sword on his spur clink
foliage moves as the horsemans form pushes through
jonathan releases the arrow whistles
imbeds in the horsemans chest
continues jonathan readies a second arrow
pulls and releases o
jonathan cries out crawling away desperately
crawling through underbrush over roots and rocks
jonathan gives up spent face to the dirt
he closes his eyes
daredevil halts astride jonathan two legs on each side of jonathans body
baltus and a large dullardly man ride
behind ichabod rides with magistrate philipse
ichabod is not adept at riding his old nag gunpowder
the van garretts died first a man and his son survived by a wife and two infants
and the widow windsor was next
and now jonathan masbath
looks back ponders why would he flee this direction with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover
he would not have gone into the western woods
no sane man would
philipse drinks from a whiskey flask sees ichabod watching and offers some
van ripper there
ahead the dullard van ripper sloppily spits tobacco
found the body this morning
pause you do believe now dont you
you said yourself
what mere man could have downed the belltower
it is a prime tenet of science philipse that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical
you need less big words and more common sense
philipse fingers an iron key talisman he wears on a cord
what is that you wear
it will protect against the horseman if i show a brave face
but i cannot run
if i run in fear it is worthless
so much for common sense
brom and baltus stand at a horses corpse amongst jagged boulders
the flesh has been stripped guts exposed
philipse and ichabod arrive and dismount
was this jonathans
seems he panicked across here and broke two legs
who took the meat
must have been the redman
a lenape indian lives in the western woods
these woods of yours sound a bit crowded what with all the witches ghouls and indians living there
brom climbs up onto his own horse a black beauty
theres only one lenape
he eats small animals and lost children
and the occasional constable when he can get it
ichabod goes to the dead horse digs in his satchel for a thin iron tool which he uses it to pry off one horseshoe
a whistle is heard o
everyone looks far ahead to where van ripper has ridden
the doctor and others are there
van ripper waves
doctor lancaster stands with several armed men
a coffin on a cart is covered by a blanket
ichabod is crouched nearby
why did you move the body doctor
to place it inside its coffin
ichabod nods vaguely annoyed
he puts the horseshoe into a hoofprint in the dirt
ichabod rises walks studying the ground kicking up leaves
brom van ripper baltus and philipse watch
ichabod finds a deep hoofprint
he compares the horseshoe
the hoofprint is much larger
ichabod pulls his satchel off his shoulder takes out a bowl bottle of water and bag of brown powder begins mixing water and powder with a fork to make plaster
the others watch finding this bizarre whispering
brom comes up to stand over ichabod irritated
what the hell are you doing
ignoring pause you are the blacksmith
ever shod a horse with a hoof this large
a shoe that size i would have remembered
ichabod starts to fill the print with plaster
can you show where the body lay
i can show exactly
van ripper dismounts wiping tobacco drool
ichabod rises to follow with his satchel
in front of this oak facing north
to the best of your recollection where did the open wound fall
van ripper points
ichabod takes a bottle of white powder from his pocket
he uncorks the bottle cautiously pouring powder in an x on the dirt there then waiting
a chemical reaction causes the powder to bubble a bit
there was not much blood was there
i didnt see none
ichabod stands puzzled
he walks to the coffin cart rolling up his sleeves
others come to watch but keep distance
ichabod removes the blanket
reveals jonathans headless corpse
philipse cant look
ichabod takes strange spectacles from his satchel wire framed with many lenses
he examines the gross neck wound sniffs it
he pokes the flesh and severed spinal cord
what is that
this should have bled by the pint
yet no blistering or scorched flesh
whatever weapon was used
it cauterized somehow
ichabod straightens eyes weirdly big in the spectacles
it instantly burnt the wound shut
a coffin in a grave
headstone reads masbath
a crowd gathered
young masbath broods
clergyman steenwyck steps forward to take a handful of newly dug dirt
men with guns stand at the outskirts like on guard
steenwyck sprinkles dirt into the grave with prayerful words
in the crowd people whisper
they steal glances at ichabod who stands with the van tassels
sarah and two other servants collect plates
a few people still sup including van ripper his warty wife and two kids
van ripper guzzles ale laughs at something his also drunk wife says
in the hall and foyer funeral goers socialize quietly
further on in the sitting room men smoke
young masbath is confronting ichabod who is leaving
i am not here for revenge
i am here to bring justice
you still need a second to tend to your things
i manage fine alone
i deserve to help you
dont you see how much this means
he was a good man
faces masbath young masbath i am sorry for your loss
it is a great and sad tragedy
i cannot be the one to look after you now
angry i did not ask you to did i
young masbath exits
ichabod remains impassive
ichabod comes out
killian a dashingly rustic man carries his son thomas and chats with baltus
doctor lancaster peers off at something through a spyglass
how are you
your gathering does honor to the deceased
still using spyglass we must be a curious sight to him
what are you spying on
offers the spyglass the lenape
he comes to gawk at civilization from time to time
searching a line of trees and foliage far away
doctor lancaster o
do you see the redskinned bastard
there he is the lenape
a towering savage with misshapen features covered in tumors
he ducks away
ichabod lowers the spyglass a little awed
he is a behemoth
a diseased monster
if you gentlemen will excuse the doctor and i
we have financial matters to discuss
ichabod and killian nod as baltus and lancaster head in
master crane sir
im glad we have time alone
youve been told plenty about the horseman im certain
more than enough actually
tired laugh i beg you no more please
no sir no
if you ask me i say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass
ichabod ponders folding the spyglass
tell me something
pause what becomes of young masbath
van ripper and his wife agreed to take him
they have children and a good home and good land
he turns to look through the window
in the dining room van ripper rises ill
his wife questions his health but he holds her off and vomits
ichabod notes this with a deep sigh
ichabod rides to young masbath seated on the ground miserable
young masbath does not look up
find yourself a place in the servants residence and wake me before dawn
our first task will be an unsavory one
young masbath runs to his horse and follows
steenwyck is on horseback looking down at ichabod furious
it is sacrilege
i cannot proceed without examining the previous victims
steenwyck looks to men with shovels
philipse hung over stands beside young masbath
magistrate philipse surely you can stop this
philipse just looks up with a helpless expression
i will not allow it
i will not
protest to my superiors if you like
your superiors are two days away
then you should have left two days ago because i have men willing to help me today
killian leads the men to the graveyard
steenwyck watches enraged
he kicks his horse and rides
philipse looks worried
a psalm is heard read by steenwyck o
while a coffin is exhumed
ichabod guides the lifting
the coffin is put near the headstone windsor
at the church steenwyck faces about fifty people who now take up the prayer
across the cemetery two coffins one small one large are pried open
killian leads the effort with young masbaths aid
the lids come off revealing the headless bodies of a man and a little boy
young masbath backs away
at the windsor coffin nails creak as ichabod opens the lid
we do not see inside but when ichabod does he is aghast
he looks to the men angry
why was i not told of this
killian arrives nods solemnly
the widow windsor
is that all you say
look at her
its not something people speak of openly
she did not remarry
ichabod kneels studying
now we see the belly of the headless corpse is bulbous because the widow windsor was very far along in a pregnancy
ichabod notices a tear in the cloth of widows blouse
he reaches through the tear feeling the stomach
he straightens greatly troubled
scissors cut open the widows blouse
theres an inch long wound on the moldering belly a sword puncture
ichabod examines the corpse on a table
lancaster watches anxiously mopping his face
young masbaths in a corner
ichabod goes to write in his ledger full of notes
what is the common thread between these victims
im sure i dont know
we must discover it
the reason the murderer chose these persons
ichabod goes to look at the widows corpse pondering
the wounds are the same
no chopping or half measures either
one stroke took the head
have you seen doctor
pointing to it even the spinal bone
sliced as smooth as butter
i do not care
you are welcome to use my work area but i beg you
return her to her resting place
in time doctor
soon as i finish
ichabod picks up an iron knife
he looks to young masbath
you should step outside
ichabod and others restore graves
ichabod looks to the church where clergyman steenwyck stands in the door
the devil sent you ichabod crane
the lord will not forgive your sins
steenwyck shuts the creaky doors
ichabod sleeps dreaming
a young boy stands in a wheat field with his back to us
a female voice is heard faintly getting louder
the boy young ichabod turns smiling
we follow to a clearing behind a frontier home
she kisses him
young ichabod in bed has one eye open
across the room mother has her back to him
shes whispering something to no one
young ichabod pretends he is asleep
a drawer is heard shutting
ichabod gets up curious opens a drawer
finds something behind clothing
its a piece of reed grass woven into an elaborate pattern with shafts of wheat twisted into the center
young ichabod replaces it closes the drawer
a busy muddy street lined by wares and produce
young ichabod walks with father an emotionless man
father stops to examine tools
young ichabod stays by him but something captures his attention
across the way mother is involved in a argument with a freakish looking woman
people stop to watch
cant make out words but freakish woman is furious
lightning flashes over tree tops
ichabod jerks awake in his bed
ichabod enters with a lantern and his ledger
he sits studies notes then notices theres a light down the hall
opposite an elaborate loom katrina reads by candlelight
she looks up seeing ichabod enter
sorry for disturbing you
i thought a forgotten candle was burning
katrina self consciously closes her shabby book puts it with another on her lap and covers them
you do not disturb me
having trouble sleeping
may i ask
why do you cover your book that way
you pay great attention to small things
i hide these as i hide all my books
father would not approve lest it were the bible
i have something to show you if you have a moment
ichabod sits looking through his ledger
these are strange
she takes his hand spreads the fingers to the palm
she touches the many evenly spaced scars
how did you get them
i have had them since childhood
i cannot remember what from
it would be interesting to find out
their eyes meet
ichabod gets back to the ledger
katrina seems to relish the effect she has
ichabod finds a paper disk on string illustrated thusly here it is
a bird on one side
his cage on the other
now stare at it
spinning it the bird seems to be in his cage
yes he does
may i try
ichabod gives it
she spins it smiling
he only appears to be inside the cage
the point being
you made this and the drawings
yes but listen
the illusion is easily explained
the eye retains each image till they combine
and yet some would call this toy magic
dont you see why
look closely a moment
put your intellect aside
spinning it cant you see what is inexplicable
ichabod watches it spin
he shakes his head unimpressed
oh you are hopeless
may i keep it at least
if you want
then i also have a gift for you
true magic which even you will not be able to deny
she hands him a book
romeo and juliet
ichabod stands offering it back but she will not take it
i insist that you have it
resigned leaving very well
but it will only sit gathering dust
that would be a pity
those words might show you something youve never seen before
ichabod stops at the door looks back
a light glows in ichabods window
looking in ichabods in bed fully dressed
he sits up
he crosses to pick up romeo and juliet
he begins to read
ichabod walks with philipse
young masbath follows with the horses
cicadas chatter from a vast corn field
not more than a year ago a mob hung a man for stealing a horse
for stealing a horse
and you dig up our dead
are you saying i should be frightened
is this a message passed on from clergyman steenwyck
the cicadas suddenly go silent
young masbath notices
we are farmers here not lawyers or bankers or even constables
every penny we earn comes from what we send down the hudson
i know it
excuse me sirs
still to ichabod because of the horseman our migrant workers flee for their lives
there is a danger that our crops will rot
so if you are going to help us you stop the horseman
that is your task
to kill an undead thing
young masbath looks to a fenced grazing area worried
the sheep there are agitated all running one direction away
listen to what you say
no you listen
you may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards
at times i do
what will it take for you to realize this is no laughing matter
the horses go crazy braying and rearing
the reins yank young masbath off his feet as the horses flee
ichabod and philipse look to masbath
a sound is heard distant thundering hoofbeats
wind kicks up
hoofbeats seem to come from all directions
philipse looks to the corn field
a flock of birds alights a great sheet of black against the sky
oh my oh my oh my
philipse runs towards his house past masbath
hoofbeats are louder closer
ichabod faces the corn field
the field explodes open stalks bending to make way as the headless horseman gallops into view atop daredevil
young masbath runs following philipse
he looks down to draw his flintlock pistol but the horseman blows by before he can raise it
a blast of air knocks ichabod off his feet
the horseman chases masbath and philipse
the horseman draws his sword
young masbath falls in the grass
daredevils pounding hooves will certainly crush him
daredevil leaps over young masbath continuing the charge
philipse has a long way to go before home
he looks over his shoulder
no way hell make it
ichabod running watches philipse slow
philipse gathers all his courage and stops turning
the horseman is closing sword held high
philipse raises his talisman
philipse holds the talisman up trying to be fearless
the horseman swings we hear the clank of sword on talisman
philipses severed head spins
his body falls and folds
ichabod runs past young masbath
the horseman halts just as ichabod reaches a point in front of dead philipse aiming his pistol
daredevil lets out a screechy cry
the horseman rides toward ichabod
ichabod gets on one knee trying to steady his pistol
the horseman closes
ichabod sweats bullets
the slug slams the horseman dead center bursts through and rends his uniform without slowing him
the horseman is almost on ichabod
ichabod cringes arms up
as the horseman passes
the horseman leans to skewer philipses head with his sword
with the head as his prize the horseman races away
ichabod gets up watches the horseman head to the forest
ichabod looks to young masbath finds his legs will not support him falls trembling
lady van tassel comes to a door knocks
sarah stands behind with a tray of food
young masbath is seated near
to young masbath has he not come out at all
young masbath shakes his head
knocking is heard
ichabod sleeps restlessly
wind and pounding rain blast open a window
mother comes to it then moves to comfort fearful young ichabod in bed
mothers voice v
dont be afraid
dont be afraid
young ichabods eye peers in
mother is kneeled before flour on the floor
she draws patterns in it whispering
she blows the flour away
the freakish woman who argued with mother walks towards the home supported by a sad man
she weeps carrying something in a blanket
young ichabod comes a window watching scared
the freakish woman is so weak that she falls
the blanket opens
the corpse of an infant tumbles to the dirt
the freakish womans wailing grows louder
two men in black drag mother to a coach
she looks back fearful pulled along
a third man in black follows
young ichabod struggles as father restrains him
the third man peers back a gray haired cotton mather ish man with a villainous face
freakish woman v
the night of the great storm i saw her cross my windows
many people in the gallery
the third man stands in front of the tearful freakish woman in the witness box
you are certain it was she
in the lighting i did see her
mother sits in shackles
i will never forget
the next moment i found my infant dead
with the blood welt on his breast
those in attendance cry out at this
ichabod is seated beside father eyes filled with tears
as before a storm rages
ichabod is in mothers arms
freakish woman v
the night of the great storm i saw her cross my windows
dont be afraid
knocking is heard
ichabod gasps awake
ichabod looks at his hands balled into fists
he opens them has one half of philipses talisman in each palm
katrina holds a tray of food
the door is heard unlocking
ichabod sits at his work table
are you hungry
ichabod shakes his head wont look up
she begins picking up pieces of the plaster hoofprint cast which lies shattered on the floor
you promised justice
if these are the random stalkings of a monster what good am i
people have put their trust in you
they have done nothing of the sort
wont they still have that justice
patience waning or was it a vain promise
ichabod stews head in his hands
someone is heard running
young masbath enters frightened
something has happened
the lenape indian hangs dead in a tree lynched
townsfolk are gathered
ichabod makes his way through followed by young masbath looking up
we do not need you constable
brom strides towards ichabod from a group of men spreading a sheet under the tree
van rippers there
the men who did this have been taken
we do not need you here
brom points to where two filthy men in chains sit in a horse drawn cart
an armed man guards them
you should thank us
the killings will end
we saved you all
the armed man shoves the filthy man to shut him up
they spend two days in chains
or would you remake our laws now that magistrate philipse has given up the ghost
does that look like an animal hanging
looks like an indian
van ripper cuts the noose rope at the trunk
the lenape corpse free falls landing hard
the lenape lies in a heap on the sheet
van ripper and others come to lift the sheet with the lenape in the middle
ichabod watches noticing
the lenape wears a woven piece of reed grass a cord on his loin cloth twisted in a pattern
give me a moment
he removes the woven piece looking across the diseased lenapes body
the lenapes mouth is agape teeth rotting
ichabod looks around finds a twig
he uses it to pull the lenapes mouth open
gets close to peer inside the lenapes mouth
a drawing of the lenapes woven piece in ichabods ledger
the piece lies near
ichabod sits staring at it trance like
the lenape indian had much to tell once i opened his mouth
how could he
someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth
the lenape could not have done that for himself
closes his journal someone out there cared for him
ichabod rises deciding
he picks up his satchel and exits
young masbath is surprised
a massive wooden windmill raised off the ground on a center post
ichabod and masbath walk to it
ichabod and young masbath enter via a ladder from the underbelly
gears and counter wheels turn millstones
a few men work in the grain powder filled air
ichabod leads the way to a staircase up twists and turns
where are we going
ichabod and young masbath climb out a door to the roof
the rotors spin nearby
ichabod searches the countryside
below many men are ride up the long straight road
what is it
its payment day
loan monies are given to baltus the last day each month
almost everyone borrows
for tools or to hire workers
ichabod sits takes a bowl from his bag and gives it to masbath then produces a bottle of water
fills the bowl
points out there
what do you see
the western woods
a plume of smoke rises from woods far
ichabod holds a piece of straw in his mouth rubs the point of a sewing needle against a small black rock
are you familiar with magnets
what kind of nuts
not for eating i assure you
ichabod shows the magnet grab the needle
young masbath is amazed reaching for it
ichabod watches him play with it
smiles pause yes
i suppose it is
no i couldnt
i have others
all i need is this
ichabod takes the needle poking its butt end into the tip of the straw
young masbath studies the rock pockets it
nods almost shy now hold the bowl steady
back to business
young masbath lifts the bowl
ichabod drops in the needle straw which floats and turns compass like
if the western woods are truly the devils glen we will see for ourselves
uneasy father said witches live there
witches do not exist
ichabod uses a knife to notch the bowl lip where the needle points then surveys the smoke making a second notch
not long ago i would have said the same for headless horseman
katrinas on horseback below unhappy
i need to speak with you
ichabod and katrina lead their horses
a heated argument
why would you do such a thing
no stone may be left unturned
it may appear harsh
i have misjudged you i think
i did not imagine you were so cruel
you are not regarding it in full
the widow windsor had been run through by a sword
i followed the bloodless wound a wound whose path i could not comprehend till i had seen the horseman with my own eyes
what are you on about
the child she carried was eight months grown at least
near to birthing
the sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly
must i hear this
there was no blind stabbing
this singular thrust found its target omnipotently as if the horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother
and this gives worth to butchery
it was not butchery
what is it then
how can any of this matter in the slightest
i have no solution for its meaning yet but i could not just ignore it
take a lesson from young masbaths desires ichabod crane
he follows with you to avenge his fathers death
that i understand
but what do you want
to avenge his father and the others
tell me why
ichabod struggles for a reply
you falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it
cant you see
youll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it
fed up growing anger if it had been surgery on a living person done to save that persons life you would not question it
not for a moment
so let me be the first to tell you dear girl
on the other side of these sheltering mountains a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours
and someday no matter how much you fear it that world will come to roust sleepy hollow out of its slumber
katrina storms away
ichabods already regretting
ichabod and young masbath ride to the western woods horses loaded for expedition
at the belltower remnants ichabod slows looking to the wreckage
at forests edge young masbath waits
ichabod circles the tower
with a sigh he rides to join young masbath
they head into the woods
dark dense and creepy
ichabod and young masbath move through
young masbath halts his horse and looks around
what is it
listens looks i hear nothing
no crickets or cicadas calling
no bird songs
ichabod notes this unhappily
ichabods hand drops the needle straw in the water bowl
the needle spins
the bowl is turned to match notches
ichabod points the way to young masbath
elsewhere someone watches a moving p
watches them as they ride follows
ichabod and masbath reach a hill crest
they stop uneasy
below a cave with a rock archway
an ill fitting door covers the mouth
the chimney spews smoke
we have apparently arrived
the horses are tied to a tree
ichabod walks to the cave door
unsure he hesitantly knocks
ichabod and young masbath step in
walls are hung with skins and skeletons dry flowers and reed grass in patterns
an old crone sits facing away
the old crone a mountain woman with matted hair and grey features sits disinterested
ichabod edges closer
you did not answer when i knocked
are we intruding
you are from the hollow
in a way yes
ichabod looks at tables of gourd bowls of dead insects and acorns
knifes scissors yellow bones
he takes the lenapes piece of reed grass from his pocket
the lenape who lived in these woods
do you know him
uncomfortable wait i should tell you
he has been murdered
you are not welcome here
the old crone places something on a table beside her a dead cardinal bright red
ichabod is afraid backing away but young masbath takes the woven piece and steps to the crone
were you a friend to the indian
waits you should have this
if you were his friend
young masbath puts the woven piece beside the cardinal
he walks to join ichabod in leaving
you seek remedy against the horseman
the old crone reaches to pick up the weaving
she stands faces them
to young masbath go out and keep away child
to ichabod you stay
follow with me
the old crone takes a candle and walks deep into the cave
the old crone comes through a passage in the wet walls
ichabod enters scared bent under low ceiling
i hear him
he rides to the hollow and back
ichabod sits on crooked stool
the old crone kneels with her back to him gathers straw in a pile on the floor
can you help
you want to see into the nether world
i can show you
whatever you see do not move or speak
i will hold him
she gathers bowls putting grass and powder on the pile
what are you doing
turns furious close your mouth
she takes two jars from a table pours ashes on the pile from one
she shakes the other roughly takes the lid off and upends it
a baby bat squirms on the floor dazed
the old crone holds the bat using a knife to cut off its head
she soaks the straw with blood speaking in tongues guttural
using a wick she lights the straw
she grasps two metal cuffs with chains attached slides these onto her bony wrists then bends to inhale smoke
he comes now
ichabod would like to leave now
young masbath waiting by the horses looks up
through the trees black clouds billow and block the sun
the old crone slumps still with her back to ichabod
she does not move
wind howls through a hole window
candles blow out
ichabod stands worried
she remains motionless
the storm outside intensifies
we see the skin of the crones wrists transform swelling in the cuffs hardening cracking and bleeding
some thing ichabod cannot see
he inches closer
are you alright
the crone turns hideous leaping erect a half human half demon creature
its black clawed hands reaching
ichabod recoils crying out
chains on restraining cuffs yank the creature back
ichabod hits the floor knocking over a table of bones
the creature is chained but still wants ichabod
the old crones face seethes from transformation eyes blood red nostrils dripping teeth now jagged
you seek the warrior bathed in blood
the headless horseman
ichabod slides back as far as possible while the creature claws the rock floor yearning
follow the indian trail to where the sun dies
follow to the tree of the dead
the creature pulls testing the chains
behind the bolt holding the chains to the wall slips
the wall cracks
climb down to the horsemans soulless place and let loose his silent shrieking
do you hear
do you hear
ichabod nods quaking aghast
he glances to the exit
the chain bolt gives more
he who holds fast the horsemans desire will guide his reaping hand
catch hold of his desire
ichabod bolts for the door
the creature howls leaping
the chain bolt breaks
ichabod cries out tackled to the floor
it is the old crone who landed on him
she has returned to human form semi conscious
ichabod shoves her off
ichabod runs out into the howling storm past masbath
we are leaving
ichabod scrambles onto gunpowder heading further into the woods glancing back
young masbath follows
a lanterns glow creates shifting shadows as ichabod and young masbath ride
follow the indian trail to where the sun dies
to the tree of the dead
looking back maybe we passed it by
how could something named the tree of the dead fail to draw attention
a bird cries out
ichabods startled looking up
the bird is heard alighting
leaves float downwards
we should not go much further in this murk
should we go back
we are far from the hollow
dismounts troubled loath to say it
better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning
horses are tied
ichabod is seated against a tree
a campfire burns
young masbath lies on a blanket rifle cross his chest staring to treetops
leaves and branches shift in the wind
bats fly wildly
what does it mean
climb down to the horsemans soulless place
let loose his silent shrieking
who knows till we work at it
i admit not being anxious to find out
pause he who holds the horsemans desire will guide his reaping hand
whatever the horsemans desire is other than extinguishing lives
a snapping branch
ichabod raises his pistol
to young masbath do not move
he creeps forward pistol and lantern forward
foliage is thick
crunching leaves are heard
ichabod crouches puts down the lantern and picks up a branch
he tosses the branch to the foliage
some animal darts away a running blur
ichabod rises following with his pistol
low to the ground moving swiftly at ichabod
ichabod spins blindsided
young masbath fires his rifle crack
the animal is knocked down mid leap yelping
the beast lands a mass of grey fur
ichabod comes to stare down
young masbath arrives
they both look to the beast horrified
the creature lies helplessly spastic a two headed wolf with one head blown open to brain and gore
its living head lifts mewing sadly eyes pleading
ichabod step up with pistol
what god forsaken hell is this
ichabod swallows back sickness looking away
something catches his eye
through the forest the skys lit up
ichabod and masbath ride up confronted by the crones cave vomiting flame out all orifices
embers swirl everywhere
the old crones body lies amongst bloodied leaves
a mob in front of the home marked lancaster physician
steenwyck addresses the rabble
you all stand idle while this man goes about with a book of secrets and a bag filled with magic
you all stand idle while the shadow of the devil falls over our town
baltus lady van tassel and katrina watch at safe distance
i say if you do nothing you share in the blasphemy of ichabod crane
killian on horseback beside his wife beth and son thomas rides to one side of the shouting crowd
listen to me
do you want to save your crops
or would you rather see your farms go to ruin
how is he saving our farms
ichabod crane has brought into our midst the soulless moldering corpse of a heretic
ichabod examines the crones neck wound with magnification spectacles
young masbath is seated ledger in his lap
the wound is neither smooth nor cauterized but jagged
she bleeds like a fountain
ichabod lifts her dead hand to show bruises and cuts
she did not go quietly
doctor lancaster wrings his hands
his wife rocks nervously in a rocking chair
the crowd outside roars as a bonfire lights up the curtained windows
the front door is pounded open
angry men enter
lancaster stands lips quivering
he points insistently to a door
angry men break in
ichabod looks up
step aside constable
ichabod is shoved aside spectacles knocked off
the group grasps the crone
masbath stands on his chair clutching the ledger
ichabod grabs one man
what are you doing
the man slams ichabod back
magnification spectacles are crushed under foot
angry men carry the corpse to a raging bonfire
the mob makes way
steenwyck cheers them
let her burn
let her burn
ichabod comes out followed by young masbath
the crones corpse is thrown in the fire
cheers all around
at ichabods side a man tries to grab the ledger young masbath holds
young masbath cries out hanging on to the book
ichabod joins the struggle
katrina watches emotions conflicting
other men grab ichabod
one punches ichabod in the face
katrina rides forward as baltus calls for her to stop
katrina leaps down into the crowd pulls men off ichabod
leave them alone
a shot rings out
everyone turns quieting
the men around masbath and ichabod turn to face brom bones
brom holds a smoking pistol flanked by theodore and glenn
let them go pointing are you going to beat an orphaned child imbecile
masbath is released along with the ledger
steenwyck moves forward pushing people aside
are you ichabod cranes protector brom bones
only for the moment
you side with him in this
i agree he has only made matters worse
but that will change if you listen
he trades with theodore pistol for a long rifle
brom hefts the rifle taking a round slug from his pocket
theodore glenn and i offer to ride each day and night to watch over the hollow
we will stalk the border of the western woods and haunt the horseman for a change with rifles like this
and slugs like this
brom brings the slug to his lips blows
hollowed out and filled with powder
brom smiles at katrina who watches unimpressed
constable crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side
i fired upon the horseman and the bullet did nothing
you must have missed your mark
i hit him square
to the crowd i say
if the horseman is solid enough to take the lives of our people hes solid enough to feel this
brom aims the rifle at a barrel down the road
plunk the barrel is hit explodes
in bed ichabod is having unpleasant dreams once more
freakish woman v
the night of the great storm i saw her cross my windows
young ichabod is seated beside father eyes tearful
we are back in the court where mother stands trial
in the lightning i did see her
points to mother her
i will never forget it
the next moment i found my infant son was dead with the blood welt on his breast
the evil third man turns to a jury of twelve men
you have heard it
the blood welt is the mark of satans touch
as the crowd murmurs in fear young ichabod looks to father who sits with hands clenched emotionless
in the quiet kitchen young ichabod looks across the table
father stares into his food
she was with me father
nothing can be done against them
she was with me that night
father doesnt even look up
young ichabod carries a lantern past pews
a soldier is seated near the altar with a rifle
may i see her
the soldier exits through a white door
young ichabod waits looking up at the vast church
the white door opens and the third man steps out
may i see my mother
you do not want to be here
go home to your father
she did not do it
she is guilty
no sir please
she is innocent
she has confessed
she has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession
do you know what confession is
off ichabods nod all that is left for you now is to pray for her soul
the third man leaves through the white door
young ichabod buttons his shirt
young ichabod comes out looks to the lawn not understanding
father loads a wagon full of belongings
we are leaving
long pause she has gone away
realization comes to young ichabod
he runs away across the lawn as father calls after him
young ichabod runs weeping
third man v
she has confessed
doors are thrown open and young ichabod enters
he goes down the aisle towards the white door
third man v
she has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession
young ichabod enters halting
the room contains torture devices iron cuffs thumb screws knifes and needles
third man v
do you know what confession is
he walks numb eyes locked forward
in the corner is a spiked chair adorned with sharp iron spikes
hundreds of spikes
it is fitted with straps for holding down the accused
tears stream down young ichabods face
he kneels hands on the spikes of the chair pressing hard
as he sobs blood runs down from his hands
in bed ichabod opens tear filled eyes
he sits up bringing his trembling hands to wipe his cheeks
his hands trail blood
he looks to them
the old scars are bleeding
katrina comes to the door
ichabod is seated by the fire eyes bleary palms wrapped with bloodied cloth
katrina comes beside ichabods chair
allow me some time
i have spent every hour in the company of others
i need to be alone
what troubles you
she moves in front
ichabod gets up and crosses to sit facing away
katrina takes the chair he deserted
the things i said to you before
i was wrong to say them
no actually you were not
every word you spoke had truth in it
what has happened
ichabod sits silent puts his head back eyes closed
lady van tassel
she is your stepmother isnt she
she bears so little resemblance
she is not your birth mother is she
why do you ask that
what happened to your mother
is she still alive
her lungs were diseased
two years ago
what is this about
memories have come back
i had them forgotten and wish i could forget them again
but they are here now
pause lord how i hate this place
if you want me to go i will
do you want me to leave
i do not know
i no longer know what i think or what i feel
katrina walks to him
she touches his back
why are you so afraid of that
is there truly such harm in uncertainty
she kneels smiles a little for him
she reaches to touch his face holds his head in her hands
leans to kiss him
he rests his head against hers weary putting his arms around her
they kiss passionately
dawn light is visible over forests pounded by rain
ichabod exits his room satchel in hand
he looks down the hall then steps back in to take a white rose from a vase
around a corner ichabod comes to the last door
he bends slipping the white rose under the crack of the door
ichabod comes out
across the lawn young masbath is bringing the horses
lady van tassel o
good morrow constable
ichabod turns to see lady van tassel in a chair sewing
returning to the western woods
nods studies her do you know
i think those are the first words i have heard from you my entire time here
as my husband says a wife should be always like an echo and at the same time quite unlike an echo
off ichabods confusion like an echo she should speak only when spoken to and unlike an echo should never try to have the last word or at least that is
what he believes
baltus comes out the door irritable skillet in hand
did you notice anything out of the ordinary during the night
ichabod eyes the skillet ill at ease trying not to be
i did not
sarah has gone missing
my servant girl
her things are gone
she has joined the migration out of town
to lady van tassel what about breakfast woman
or am i to starve to death
lady van tassel gets up and goes in taking the skillet
i should be going
good day to you
ichabod heads towards young masbath
baltus watches from the porch disgruntled
he goes in
ichabod and young masbath ride side by side
if the crones wound bled hard that means she was not killed by the hessian
someone only tried to make it look that way
you grow sharper by the minute little man
it boggles my mind but i begin to prefer your company over all others
im one of the few people who likes you
laughs true enough
then who murdered the old crone
good questions deserving answers of which we are in short supply
a sound is heard
ichabod looks back then to masbath
ichabod rides faster
young masbath keeps up
further on they charge over a hill
ichabod halts gunpowder and climbs clumsily off
young masbath obeys
ichabod takes out his pistol and wades into forest growth backtracking
inside the forest ichabod bounds through underbrush low
a horse is heard snorting
he pushes through branches
moving behind a figure in a grey cloak on horseback
halt and turn
i have a pistol aimed at your head
the figure stops pushes off the cloak hood
it is only me
why do you follow
i apologize if i worried you
a woman should not be out alone in these woods
but i am not alone am i
i only wished to see what you were up to and
takes out white rose to thank you
ichabod softens but doesnt want to
ichabod masbath and katrina come into a clearing mouths falling open at the sight of
a monstrously huge tree of the dead at the clearings center with branches reaching far and wide knotted and gross like agony captured in wood sculpture
ichabod dismounts crossing a line beyond which grass and weeds will not grow
young masbath and katrina dismount
you were right
it does draw attention to itself
ichabod stares up into the endless dead canopy of branches
he circles the incredibly wide trunk
theres a vertical wound in the bark as if the tree once had a terrible vertical in it now partially healed and disgustingly scarred
he feels the mushy scar picking at its scabs till much sap begins to trickle
it is red and ichabod fingers it
what did you say
ichabod goes to where katrina and masbath wait with the horses digs in a saddle bag for a hand axe
what is it
at the trunk ichabod thumps the flat end of the axe against the suture
it sounds hollow
ichabod begins to chop
he pulls away loose bark
the tree drips more blood and a clear goo
ichabod uses both hands on the axe to hack at the festering suture
what are you doing
keep where you are
ignoring young masbath moves closer
ichabod keeps chopping then grips a large loose flap of wood trying to bend it
its not easy
katrina follows masbaths slow advance
the flap suddenly gives revealing a blood soaked wide eyed gap mouthed human head
behind him katrina stifles a scream taking young masbath in her arms to keep him from looking
it is philipses head hanging off the trunk flap held by roots grown around and into the flesh
ichabod reapproaches back of his hand to his mouth
four other severed decaying heads are held by ingrown roots within the dewy innards
what has happened
he tries to take the heads
they will not pass
he looks to the branches towering above
must be some sort of gateway
but why this place
we should go
why this tree
ichabod begins looking at the ground moving around the tree
he gets to his knees pushing mud away
uncovering a flush headstone carved with
to himself climb down to the horsemans soulless place
to masbath bring the shovel
young masbaths crouched muddy rifle across his knees
hes watching the tree
behind him katrina climbs out of the shallow grave near a pile of mud
ichabod hands up the shovel
masbath weve found it
young masbath goes to the grave
ichabod pulls at thick burlap cloth straining as it comes away
ichabod looks down disbelieving
it cannot be true
we see roots have gripped the horsemans bones and tattered uniform
the skeleton is all there except the skull
why is it every grave i open holds a new mystery inside
the skull is gone
i did notice that thank you
ichabod climbs out weary in body and spirit
he stares at the bones
this is his silent shrieking
and his desire to reclaim his head
ichabod turns looking to the bordering forest
he who holds fast the horsemans desire will guide his reaping hand
pause someone controls the horseman
ichabod turns looks
katrina and young masbath back away because the roots in the grave are alive further entwining around remains
ichabod spins to the twisted tree
the vertical suture seethes pulling inwards
sucking philipses head back in and closing bubbling
ichabod bounds over grave dirt pile hastening katrina and young masbath along as he flees
at the tree the suture swells
ichabod katrina and young masbath pass where their freaking horses are tied to a fallen trunk heading for cover
a rumbling is heard from the twisted tree which suddenly bursts wide spitting smoldering cinders
at the tree line ichabod katrina and young masbath cower looking back
from the tree wound a glow brightens till the headless horseman and daredevil explode into existence
they hit the ground running
ichabod watches the horseman ride away with bolts of lightning striking the ground behind
the horseman disappears in the forest
his next victim is chosen
to masbath give me distance then guide her back to the hollow
ichabod runs towards the horses
the horseman rips past on daredevil
ichabod rides as fast as gunpowder is able
killian thomas and beth have finished supper
beth clears plates as killian picks his teeth with a knife
may i be excused father
do you deserve to be
shyly i think so
smiles then go
thomas gets down from his chair
he goes to the fireplace to light a tallow wick which he takes to the next room
thomas plops on the floor and lights his magic lantern a lantern with an outer sleeve of glass painted with silhouettes of lions and monsters
thomas turns the lantern and looks to the walls where the creatures shadows are thrown
he roars for them imagining them real and having a grand time
beth comes for more dishes
dont pick teeth
you teach thomas bad habits
killian pulls her to him playful
i am a bad habit
theres nothing for it
kisses him no one knows better than i
thomas continues his fun shadow animals circling him
in the shifting light a baby spider comes from a crack in the wall
then another spider skitters out
a black horse runs hooves pounding the ground
thunder is heard
the horse slows and stops
it is broms horse with brom aboard
brom looks skyward
the storm harshens roaring through the trees
distant hoofbeats can be heard
brom takes his rifle off his shoulder
the hoofbeats grow louder and pass far away
brom turns in the saddle and whistles
he kicks his horse and rides
thomas still watches shadow beasts but sees something else
he goes to the crack where hundreds of spiders flee all directions
thomas is amused
behind killian mantelpiece stones pulse breathing almost imperceptibly
demonic faces form then disappear and reform again shifting
beth enters looking at thomas
what are you doing there
the magic lantern stops spinning
shadow creatures freeze
the entire house creaks
killian looks up
the howling wind is loud
beth comes to thomas side as he points
beth bends to see the swarming spiders
she looks up noticing the ferocity of the wind
killian stands looking up
the house creaks again then suddenly the wind ceases
beth picks up thomas
the magic lantern creatures begin spinning anew all around
with a roar the fire flares
whhooosh the fire shoots up the fireplace
behind killian the door splinters inwards
the horseman steps in a battle axe in each hand
the door to the other room slams
killian grabs a kitchen chair and hurls it at the horseman
the horseman swings smashing it aside
beth hugs thomas to her as she backs away
from kitchen get out
killian grabs an iron skewer from the fireplace swings it to fend off a blow from the horseman
the horseman swings the other axe
the axe cracks fireplace stone throwing sparks
killian lunges jamming the skewer into the horseman
the skewer comes through the horsemans back
the horseman swipes with the flat of one axe pounding killian aside
killian hits the wall bashing his head
hits the floor
beth kicks a carpet to reveal a trap door
the horseman pulls the skewer out of his body throws it
he goes to lift killian by the hair with one hand brings back the axe in the other
at the trap door beth lowers thomas to stairs leading to the cellar
thomas is crying
dont let him get you
you hide now
beth closes the trap door frantically replacing the carpet
the rooms door flies open and the horseman strides in carrying killians severed head
the horseman steps forward knocks over the magic lantern
beths screams are abruptly cut off
her body is heard hitting the floor above
thomas crosses the cellar stumbles
he scurries into the shelter of a wheelbarrow propped against the wall
footsteps are heard
the horsemans hands place killians and beths heads in a sack cinching the sack shut
the headless horseman enters bends to retrieve the battle axe he left
thomas trembling hands pull the wheelbarrow closer
he tries to control his sobbing
the horseman turns falls to his knees
he starts to chop at the floor with both axes
chopping chopping chopping
making quick work of it
a hole appears in the ceiling as debris falls
thomas looks up terrified
he gets up to run away
the horsemans arm shoves through above grasping thomas and yanking him up
brom rides from the forest charging across killians field
at killians house daredevil rides up as the headless horseman walks out with his sack of heads
the horseman ties the sack to the saddle and leaps up
brom puts his reins in his mouth raising his rifle
the horseman heads away past the barn as brom gains
boom the slug explodes blowing the horseman off daredevil
daredevil keeps going
the horsemans smoldering body is left face down
brom halts his horse
he climbs down pleased
the horseman moves
brom backs away satisfaction diminishing
the horseman gets on his knees
brom falls to one knee begins reloading
he fills the gun from his powder horn
the horseman stands unsheathes his sword and turns
the blast has blown apart his uniform at the chest and shoulder exposing rotten flesh and maggot infested muscle
brom readies his ramrod jamming powder in the barrel
the horseman charges
brom stands pulling out the ramrod
the horseman is on him
brom swings the rifle blocking
the battle is on with brom fending off the horsemans sword with the gun clank clank clank
across the field ichabod and gunpowder break into the open
up the field the horseman makes a backhanded swing
brom goes down his rifle sent flying
brom rolls to avoid as the horseman slashes
the horseman pulls and throws a knife
thwap the knife imbeds in broms thigh
the horseman runs towards brom
ichabod closes in pulling an unlit lantern off his saddle
brom tries to get up bends to extract the knife
the horseman mid run changes his sword grip blade down
he plants one foot on broms back raising his sword about to skewer
ichabod arrives full gallop smashes the lantern into the horseman knocking the horseman off brom
at the edge of the forest theodore and glen arrive on horseback
they hold a moment watching
brom runs limping to the barn goal in sight farm implements propped there
brom grabs scythes with long curved blades one in per hand
the horseman rises
ichabod turns gunpowder and leaps off runs to brom
the horseman moves towards them hefting a battle axe in his free hand
ichabod steps up pistol aimed furious
for what its worth
fires the bullet rips through the horsemans stomach to reveal putrid innards as he keeps advancing
at the forest theodore looks to glenn turns and flees
brom steps up scythes ready
he and the horseman go at it
brom blocks axe and sword catching and deflecting blows
at the forest glenn follows theodore away
ichabod grabs a long handled sickle
brom swings the scythes
the horseman avoids
ichabod moves to the side looking for an opening
he swings the sickle
the horseman blocks
the horseman battles both at once catching blows
countering every strike metal ringing
brom catches the horsemans sword in one scythe holding it off
catches the axe handle in the other scythe
the horseman flatfoot kicks broms chest sending him down
ichabod swings the sickle blade
hits the horseman the blade embedding to the hilt
the horseman drops his axe and grasps the sickle jerking
the sickle handle slams ichabods knocking him away
ichabod crawls tries to shake off the blow
he looks up
the horseman staggers spastically trying to pull the blade from his body
brom limps to ichabod yanks him to his feet
we cannot win this
they head towards the forest
behind the horseman extracts the sickle throws it
he strides after them picks up his axe on the way
ichabod and brom stumble down a hillside
they run to a dock at the edge of a wide rapid river
they jump into a flat boat barge
go to the front and guide it
brom uses a scythe to slash the ropes
ichabod picks up a guide pole
the barge lurches set free
ichabod struggles to push the boat out
it moves swiftly caught in rain swollen current
brom looks back
he leaves the scythe and moves to the front hefting another pole to help guide
lets see him catch us now
ichabod looks to the shore
lightning illuminates ahead the horseman stands on the bank with axe and sword
well pass right by the son of a bitch
ichabod and brom push with the poles trying for speed
at the bank the horseman walks directly to the water
just as he takes a step onto the water the rain churned surface transforms instantly becoming a sheet of ice
spreading and supporting the horseman as he advances
ice shoots out ahead of him towards a point in the river where it will intercept the barge
the horsemans ice bridge engulfs the barge halting it
ichabod and brom are thrown
the barge is trapped
the horseman nears
brom runs to the rear to retrieve his scythe
ichabod holds up the only weapon he has his guide pole
the horseman steps on board
the horsemans axe cracks the pole in half
the horseman thrusts with sword into ichabods chest clean through
it sizzles as ichabod screams
the horseman lifts ichabod up flips him pulling the sword out as ichabod goes
smashing through the ice and under
underwater water carries ichabod slams him against ice above
hes pulled down by undertow
above water beyond the edge of the ice bridge ichabod comes up gasping choking on rain
he treads water looking to the barge
aboard the barge the horseman cuts brom down
stands over him chopping with sword
our view grows blurry and
ichabod shirtless feverish opens his eyes
the wound at the top of his chest is raw
katrina inserts a needle in the skin around it
lay still ichabod
do not move
doctor he is awake
ichabod tries to sit
pain stops him
lady van tassel helps bleed the wound with the needle and a tube leading to a suction jar of blood
barely a voice what
what are you doing
im drawing bad blood from the wound
doctor lancaster comes to the bed
keep still constable
you were half drowned when they found you
he is dead
you would be also if your wound had not somehow shut
bring young masbath here
you need to sleep
you need rest
ichabod gives up closes his eyes
katrina needle in one hand brings her other hand to hold ichabods
blood drips into the suction jar
ichabod is soundly asleep
across the room katrina is at his work table
katrina looks to him
once she is satisfied he will not wake she returns to what she was doing turning a page
she is reading his ledger
young masbath lies awake
a glint of light crosses the window
masbath looks to it gets up peers out
through the window he can see the van tassel manor house in the distance
lantern light crosses the lawn
the lantern light moves through the orchard away from the house
we cannot make out the person
elsewhere young masbath runs in pursuit
he hides against one tree leans to look
the light enters forest
young masbath follows
masbath helps with a shirt
someone left last night
looked like they headed to the square but i lost them in the forest
man or woman
all i saw was their lantern
business best hidden is hidden best at night
ichabod goes to his work table organizing his satchel
if someone has the horsemans skull
if they control the horseman then why havent they sent him for your head yet
because i serve a fine purpose alive
it is perfection for our murderer if i return to new york city with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul
pause we must uncover the reason these victims were targeted
what was taken from them
other than their lives
who benefits by their deaths
ichabod fumbles the bottle of white powder
it bounces cork popping out
rolls under the bed
ichabod kneels pained
a trail of the blood detecting powder has spilled
the bottle is out of reach
ill get it
young masbath gets down ready to crawl for it but ichabod stops him peering under
far under near the bottle some powder is bubbling
ichabod moves to the end of the bed and lifts in pain
young masbath helps
they drag the bed to one side
under the bed a satanic pentagram has been drawn in blood
ichabod stares trying to grasp the implication
masbath is about to speak but ichabod puts a finger to his lips
ichabod moves to lock the door
whispers who did this
ichabod does not answer
he picks up a wash basin and dumps the water to wash the pentagram away
wagons horses and townspeople swarm
a crowd loots the towns general store
provisions are passed along man to man and loaded on wheelbarrows
all up and down the long straight road home owners board up windows with lumber
ichabod and young masbath ride passing many angry faces
panic has set in
they stop tying their horses and climbing stairs to the door of the notary
ichabod looks off
down the road at the far end people head to the church
much activity there as well
or so they hope
families put up tents all around the church within the bordering wrought iron fence
people work to build and erect massive wooden crosses
young masbath watches ichabod hand a slip of paper to the elderly notary hardenbrook
do you have these persons wills
i have everything
birth certificates death certificates
but do you have these
hardenbrook studies the paper with his one good eye
hardenbrook nods handing the list back grinning
ichabod stands waiting
hardenbrook is still nodding
may i see them master hardenbrook
may we look at them now
you want them
it shall not take long
hardenbrook heads across the room
ichabod offers the list
maybe you should take this
a fine idea
hardenbrook takes it and exits
young masbath sits
what good is this
to discover what might have been taken from those who died it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place
after a moment he looks uncertain
he crosses to the half open door
ichabod sticks his head in not liking what he sees
hardenbrooks amidst unbelievable disarray
tables shelves and baskets of unevenly piled documents
hardenbrook looks on a shelf confused then goes to a table lifting papers mumbling
hardenbrook turns a bit startled
perhaps i could assist in finding them
that might be
hardenbrook is asleep in a chair snoring blind eye open
ichabod and young masbath face official looking documents with ichabod focused on one will in hand
my father had farm land
it was the only thing we owned of any value
still reading and it now belongs to you according to baltus
i heard him say it
ichabod turns the will in his hand to masbath
then look here at your fathers will and tell me why you are not listed
young masbath takes it boggled
ichabod grabs another
van garrett had denoted his elder son in his last wishes the same son murdered along with him
but van garretts wife and two infant children are not written
and they were spared
picks up another will do you see
philipse had no family to bestow his farm to
picks up another the widow windsor was listed on her late husbands will
after her inheritance she amended the document to include her bastard child
this is why the horseman made absolutely certain to impale the unborn descendant
ichabod sits back
only the heirs were killed
proof that the horseman slaughters by assignment
but if the farm is not mine who stole it away
no one yet far as i can tell
it has gone intestate
all the farms
they belong to no one
what does it mean
ichabod stares off
often in such cases property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to
and who in this town is owed a great many debts
realization baltus van tassel
did your father take a loan
i rode with him on payment days
ichabod stands grim gathering wills and his ledger
tonight we answer questions
and to discover who moves about the van tassel house after dark
all we need is a candle
a loud noise is heard from the other room
ichabod bursts in
no one there
a chair has been knocked over and the front door is ajar
all around is the commotion in the square as before
no telling who it was who just fled
young masbath is seated bored
ichabod writes in his ledger
a knock on the door
they both look up
from outside door constable
are you there
long pause ichabod
the knob is tried and found locked
at the bottom of the door a red rose is passed under
this saddens ichabod
the church is a sight with a yard resembling an empty squatters tent city surrounded by crosses
boarded over windows leak shafts of light
moving past the windows many eyes peer out from the slats
up in the belfry two riflemen are on watch
ichabod and masbath are in darkness still waiting
ichabod takes the cover off a lantern looks at a clock
midnight straight up
ichabod stands picks up an unlit candle
midnight seems an appropriate time
ichabod and young masbath look out cautious
they move to the nearest door
ichabod crouches using the candle to mark the seam of the door and door frame
hes making a low wax seal
if the door opens the seal will break
they move to a second door quietly
ichabod makes another low wax mark
ichabod and masbath come downstairs to a hall
ichabod continues his wax marking at each door
ichabod and young masbath enter shutting the door
ichabod walks to shelves at baltus desk looks through ribbon bound documents and hands some to masbath
young masbath pulls off the ribbon pages through these loan agreement parchments
ichabod brings another pile
whispering they are alphabetical
young masbath has the ms
maryie megapolenisis and melyn
not finding what he wants
there is no masbath here
my fathers loan papers are missing
regarding his documents there are none for magistrate philipse either
paasch james pieter thomas pos william
a floorboard creaks
ichabod looks blows out the lantern
he and young masbath stand frozen
across the room light comes under the door stops then continues
a door is heard opening and shutting
ichabod crosses to follow pointing back
then hide in my room and bolt the door till i return
lantern light moves far ahead
ichabod stops hidden
he can see the light ahead but it is no longer in motion
a lantern sits on a rock
on a blanket a semi naked man and semi naked woman are in the midst of rough sex
ichabod crawls to peer from underbrush
the couple keeps coupling with the man on top
his grunts and gasps are particularly desperate
hes all over the woman who lays back
it is lady van tassel
ichabod swallows inches closer
lady van tassel pulls the mans shirt exposes his flesh
she raises a small sharp knife behind his back
ichabods eyes widen
lady van tassel brings the blade to her own hand slicing deep in her palm
she rubs her cut hand over her partners arching back smearing blood
lady van tassel caresses the mans chest neck face
the man lifts his head in ecstasy sucks the womans bloody fingers
its clergyman steenwyck
ichabod backs away having seen more than plenty
young masbath unlocks the door
i was getting worried
who was it
lady van tassel
what was she doing
something i really wish i had not seen
never mind it
did you find the victims loan agreements
they are all missing
this troubles ichabod
there is more though
while you were gone i could hear someone else walking through the house
ichabod and young masbath creep round a corner
going to the last door ichabod crouches eyes narrowing
whispers to himself katrina
the wax seal is broken flecks of wax on the floor
ichabod and masbath come downstairs checking all the wax marks
young masbath finds one broken
ichabod comes over pushes the door
the kitchen is empty
ichabod crosses to another door crouches
another broken wax mark
the room with the elaborate loom
ichabod moves his lantern to make a quick search goes to table
he touches the top of a candle
his finger comes away with a bit of still wet wax
there are no other doors
this is as far as she could have gone
it is nothing
she comes to read books so her father will not find her
to convince himself it is absolutely nothing
fiction plays and novels
baltus does not approve
it may not be long before lady van tassel returns
where are they
ichabod stops looking around
no books anywhere
if there is a secret place for books
it could be just as good for the missing loan agreements
ichabod ponders this without saying anything
drawers are opened and searched quietly
young masbath uses a candle to look up the fireplace
ichabod opens a linen cabinet unfolding blankets
young masbath looks in a closet filled with big spools of sewing thread on his knees pulls a wooden box forward
inside it he finds only old cups and silverware
ichabod pulls up a rug feeling along the floorboards
young masbath crawls doing the same
he climbs under the loom tapping on the floor
he crawls further under the loom
a hollow sound
he taps again
ichabod comes over as young masbath lifts a loose board
under the floor there are piles of books
masbath brings them up handing them to ichabod who studies the spines
young masbath reaches in up to his shoulder
he comes up with loan agreements
here they are
ichabod takes them
names are near the top masbath van garret philipse and killian
ichabod sits back numb his heart bitterly broken
lady van tassel prepares food with two servants at the open fireplace oven
ichabod enters rushed
excuse me lady van tassel
katrina is not in her room
she has gone out
she has taken the last of our grain to be milled
crossing to him you do have a background in the medical arts dont you constable
i must be going
lady van tassel holds out her cut palm the gash sewn shut
will you look at this
i cut my hand this morning i sewed it myself but i am afraid it will go bad
ichabod takes her hand distracted and nervous
it appears well
it has already clotted
do you have anything to clean it with
it is fine
now i must
lady van tassel grabs ichabod by the wrist tight
whispering close i know you saw me
lady van tassel glances to servants keeps her voice low
i know you followed last night
you must promise not to tell baltus
ichabod tries to pull away but she grips tighter
the front door is heard slamming
ichabod is panicky
have mercy on me
ichabod pulls away just as baltus enters
lady van tassel goes back to work as if nothing happened
constable it is urgent that we speak
baltus leads ichabod to the porch
clergyman steenwyck is calling a meeting
this time he is determined to have you forced out or worse
how did you hear this
he came to me
he promised great violence
said i should cast you out for my own protection
troubled pause i must speak honestly
there is no reason to think he will not meet with success
ichabod looks to barn sees masbath bringing the horses
the church bell is heard tolling far away
that is the meeting bell already calling
with the murder of killian and brom no one sees any good from you
if you were to leave
you might be saving your own life
ichabod studies baltus then offers his hand
i appreciate your concern
i thank you sir
ichabod hurries off across the lawn exasperated
masbath runs to him
ichabod takes gunpowder and climbs up
mounting his horse what now
where is she
things have become complicated
katrina is at the mill
ride ahead find her and bring her to meet me outside the church
find her at all costs
they ride fast
a conjuring pile of straw burns
gloved hands unfold a paper filled with clippings of human hair
the hair is sprinkled on the fire
a cloaked figure is kneeled at the pile
the figure turns to remove a human skull from a cloth bag
the skull is placed at center in the flames
its teeth are sharp cut to points
the horsemans skull
in the church yard refugee camp food is prepared over fire
people inhabit the tents
in the church its crowded with families
pews filled with bedding and belongings
steenwyck comes to close the double doors of his quarters turning angry
you are astonishing constable
do you truly think your ridiculous accusations frighten me
ichabod is doing nothing to hide his disdain
only if i repeat them outside this room
and i will if i must
points to doors out there for all to hear
you may speak as planned
but you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures
you will not run me out
no one will believe a word of what you say
far as i can tell a rumor does not travel alone for long here
are you a deist
is that it
a free thinker who does not believe in divinity
it is only important what you are
i am the lords voice in this town
wallowing in sin and lust
they need guidance
wallowing quite literally in blood
snapping quaking damn you sir
god damn you to hell
but not soon enough for you and not on your behalf
steenwyck is humiliated
you are so upset now
and yet you seemed in such good spirits last night
you cannot do this
i am a man of god
climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find father
that is the closest you ever come to god
pews are packed
steenwyck enters walks to the altar
steenwyck has composed himself barely
those of you still on your farms i thank you for coming
he sees ichabod near the back
thunder is heard outside
i address unfortunate business
pause i am forced to take my leave from sleepy hollow
i will be moving on to do the lords work elsewhere
the gatherers murmur shock
ichabod walks out
baltus and lady van tassel ride
the meeting has most certainly already begun
we do not want steenwyck as our enemy
lady van tassel trails
wood is heard splintering
just off the road a tree falls
the trunk catches lady van tassels horse on its rear flank
the horse falls
lady van tassel hits the dirt
baltus looks back halting
lady van tassel looks up to baltus in fear then turns
behind her the headless horseman trots from the forest on daredevil stops
he takes his axe in hand
the meeting is letting out
near the churchyard gate young masbath rides with katrina following on a horse cart
ichabod walks up as katrina dismounts
what is so urgent
come with me
ichabod leads her to where they can talk away from others
why have i not seen your face for so long
you look much better
she touches his face but he takes her hand places the loan agreements there
i found them secreted away in the sewing room
katrinas expression changes just so slightly to guilt
why have i scrambled and run and clawed in all directions only to find you against me
he stares at her
katrina stares back in a small way defeated
she looks for an out but there is none
i have been reading your journal
i found it too fascinating to resist
pause ashamed i rode to catch up with you at the notary out of curiosity
before i found you though i overheard what you were said
it was you there
when you spoke fathers name along with accusations i could not believe it
i had to hide these
at least till i could confront him myself
and what did he say
he did not do these things
if you knew him you would realize
what did he say katrina
i have not been able to face him yet
the loans give the land to your father
it does not matter survivors are still on their farms
they could be thrown off
a year from now
yes i have seen that and i told you why i hid them
what would you have me believe
tiring angry if you think i am behind this say it
the name van tassel is blackened
you share that name
call me a liar then and a murderess
say it out and out
many people are starting to notice the confrontation
speak the words constable
what is stopping you
what has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality
emotions tear at him
rain seems to pound down harder
dont dare stand looking as if you still care for me after all that you have said
if i were to confess would that ease your suffering
would that make it easier for you to hate me
a tortured cry is heard o
baltus comes charging through the square on his horse
the horseman is coming
hes barely hanging on
he stops practically falling off running towards katrina and ichabod
he killed her
baltus grasps katrina fearful
hoofbeats are heard
the horseman has killed her
far behind the horseman rides to follow axe held up
instant mayhem people scatter all directions screaming
baltus runs headlong to the church
katrina runs after baltus
ichabod backs away watching the horseman come then heads to the church with masbath
baltus pushes through the iron gate into tent city joining the swarm of townsfolk pouring into the church
the horseman rides behind closing the gap
men women and children run for cover all along the square
amidst the churchyard panic ichabod looks back
the horseman reaches the open gate and daredevil suddenly rears up snorting unwilling to enter
the horseman grabs daredevils reins tries to move forward again
daredevil freaks out
baltus makes his way in shoving
people are still clamoring in through the doors
men pass rifles from stockpiles and climb onto pews at boarded windows
women herd children into a cellar
baltus searches for a hiding place
he looks across the church to see steenwyck closing the doors of his living quarters
at the front doors katrina squeezes in with ichabod and young masbath just as people are forcing the doors closed
people outside begin pounding
ichabod goes to a window looking out between boards
across the yard the horseman gives his axe an underhand toss to the ground inside the gate
the axe instantly begins to degrade to dust in the rain
the horseman rides keeping outside the fence
ichabod comes away from the window looking to panicked citizens
he sees katrina moving up the aisle
shes heading towards baltus who slams against the door to steenwycks room
damn you steenwyck
let me in
rifles boom loudly as men at the windows begin firing
the horseman circles under fire
great clouds of gun smoke shoot from the church
men fire down from the belfry
parts of the horseman and daredevil splatter red into the rain as slugs hit without effect
at the other side of the church the horseman comes around heading to the town square
rifleman shout to each other running to the opposite windows to follow the horseman
young masbath grabs a rifle and leaps to join the brigade
baltus is still beating steenwycks door when a huge farmer grips baltus angrily and throws him
youll kill us all
baltus falls knocking over pews
youre the one the horseman wants
why should we die for you
the huge farmer picks baltus up dragging him and shoving katrina aside as she approaches
ichabods pushing past people trying to reach them
the horseman brings daredevil to a halt yanking a large coil of rope off a hitching post
the huge farmer shoves baltus to the floor again
others join the rage pulling baltus towards the front of the church shouting
ichabod struggles to push them off
ichabod gets to baltus side trying to protect
the horseman cannot enter
it does not matter who he wants he cannot cross the gate
at the windows one rifleman turns crying out
hes coming back
the huge farmer moves towards baltus
we have to save ourselves
baltus pulls the pistol from ichabods holster brandishing
get away from me
the horseman rides past the front fired upon
he halts at the wrought iron gate reaching to yank off one post which is pointed on top like an arrow head
baltus holds everyones back with the pistol
the next person to lay hands on me will have a bullet
were safe here
points at ichabod you said it
the horseman will not have me
crash the harpoon like post spears through a window trailing rope tied to it
crack skewers baltus from behind the bloodied point bursting out his breast bone
baltus looks down drops the gun
clutching the post with both hands
blood streams out his mouth
the rope yanks baltus back
he slams into the window
baltus crashes out hits the ground dragged
outside the fence daredevil runs with the rope tied around his saddle pommel
the horseman strides forward sword out
baltus slams the fence and the rope snaps
he is held there awkwardly gurgling blood
the horseman reaches baltus
chops off his head
the storm has passed
long peaceful pause till ichabod makes his way through searching the ground
ichabod comes to look down a small hill
the corpse of lady van tassel lies headless in a dirty torn dress
ichabod walks to the body
lady van tassels arm is twisted behind
the sewn cut on the palm of her hand faces up
shouting back here
i have found her
looking at corpse quiet and miserable here she is
doctor lancaster comes out from where katrina is asleep
he closes the door wipes his sweaty face
it has been a terrible jolt to her nerves
you will stay at her side
doctor lancaster nods
its getting dark
ichabod comes out and crosses the porch
a few of the hollows residents are here
young masbath gets up and follows ichabod onto the lawn
ichabod walks without waiting
shes the one who controlled the horseman isnt she sir
no answer i need time for thinking
without you hanging on my coattails for a change
ichabod keeps walking
young masbath stops wounded
ichabod stands holding a torch looking up
the whole area is bright from the light off a giant fire
there are broken lanterns and barrels around the agonized twisted tree
the tree is aflame fire dancing up the trunk and through every branch to lick the sky
ichabod is seated overlooking the hudson
he stares at the beauty around him brooding through bleary eyes
gunpowder is tied to a tree
the ledger is open in ichabods lap
he thumbs pages absently just keeps staring off
a fire burns in a circle of rocks
ichabods ledger is thrown in
the pages catch quickly
ichabod watches then walks away
hes about to climb onto gunpowder but on second thought he opens his satchel and digs out a book
he walks back to the fire throws it on
romeo and juliet
flames devour it
the clearing is silent
the twisted tree still stands smoldering impressive as ever or perhaps even more so with the alien appearance its blackened skin now affords it
ichabod packs up baggage
young masbath is miserable
wont you change your mind sir
what can i say to convince you
to hell with this place and all the people here
ichabod closes a bag throws it with others
why are you like this
pause softening you do not know all that has happened
pause you cannot understand
a coach with gunpowder as one of its team waits in the orchard
van ripper comes to meet ichabod and masbath
half when we reach the city
ichabod hands van ripper money
van ripper takes the baggage
ichabod looks to the manor house
only one light shines in a second floor window
katrina can be seen there a moment as she closes curtains
ichabod turns to young masbath who is beginning to cry
this is farewell
take me with you
theres nothing left for me here
bends to masbath you should not worry
pause sorrow van ripper and his wife will look after you
you will be well cared for
young masbath hugs
ichabod hugs back swallowing
i am sorry
quietly forgive me
i failed you
ichabod releases and goes quickly away finding this misery unbearable
he climbs in the coach
do not go constable
how can you leave
inside the coach ichabod slumps back in darkness and closes his eyes
he pounds twice on the coach wall
outside van ripper whips the reins
the coach starts
young masbath follows
the coach picks up speed on the long straight road
young masbath stops wiping tears
ichabods coach moves through the town square
a few people in the churchyards tent city come out to watch it pass
the door is pushed open
young masbath enters looks around the empty room
he goes to sit in a chair at the work table crossing his arms and resting his head
a plate of food sits untouched
katrina is slumped down in a chair heartbroken staring into the fireplace
behind her a shadow moves across the room
van ripper leads the coach through the stone pillars marking the entrance of sleepy hollow
ichabod takes off his hat sets it on the seat
the window between him and the driver slides open
this is yours
offering something the van tassel girl said to give it to you after you were gone
ichabod takes it
it is the bird cage spinning toy
he studies it
katrina sits with her eyes closed
a board is heard creaking
she sits up
suddenly a figure in black is behind her as she turns
a gloved fist strikes
a dull thud is heard downstairs like a body falling
young masbath takes notice
he moves to the door
ichabod turns the strings on the bird cage toy ponders it
the paper disk spins images flickering until the bird appears to be inside the cage
ichabod keeps spinning it looks out the window
a tear rolls down his cheek
the bird cage toys rotation slows
ichabod looks at it a long moment then pockets it and leans forward to the window at front
ichabods face appears behind van ripper
van ripper turn the coach about
what did you say
young masbath comes down the stairs looking around meekly
masbath starts down a hall
he does not see in another room katrinas body is dragged across the floor
the coach comes to lancasters
ichabod climbs out before it even stops fully satchel in hand
doctor lancaster half asleep comes to answer banging on his door
ichabod pushes past taking lancasters lantern
pardon the intrusion
there are two coffins on the floor
i never examined these bodies
ichabod removes the lid from one coffin
lancaster is about to say something indignant but then just looks disgusted
help yourself you pompous ass
i will be in bed
would you stay doctor
i may need assistance
lancaster reluctantly remains
ichabod stares at the dead lady van tassel
the neck wound is covered by a stained brown cloth which ichabod unwraps
stains of blood
what of it
ichabod takes out one of the lenses that survived the magnification spectacles bends to examine the neck
pause the horseman did not do this
ichabod moves to the side of the coffin lifting the hand with the stitched gash on its palm
hold this just so
lancaster holds the lens so that ichabod can study the cut through it
ichabod takes a scalpel like knife from his satchel lifts the hand and cuts stitches
through the lens the gash spreads easily soft bloodless
no clotting or gathering of pus
no healing at all
when this cut was made this person was already dead
stands straight this is not lady van tassel
young masbath enters
the door swings shut
steps forward is anyone here
behind him the door slams open lady van tassel reaches to grab young masbath by the throat
ichabod charges up to the church doors pounding
open the door
open up damn it
pounds shouting lady van tassel is alive
the horseman is her puppet
the door opens and huge farmer points a rifle at ichabod
frightened people peer out from behind
arent we rid of you
listen to me
lady van tassel has faked her death
i need able men
shes dead and you have gone mad
steps forward get out
isnt it enough that you have ruined this town
ichabod backs away from the gun frustrated runs
at the doctors residence van ripper is still on the coach
ichabod sprints over breathless taking out his pistol
do you have a gun
van ripper hold up a rifle
ichabod holds out his hand
may i see it
van rippers confused but hands the rifle over
ichabod immediately points his pistol at van ripper
van ripper climbs off
ichabod climbs up whips the horses
van ripper watches the coach leave still with his hands up
in a wooded area katrina lies unconscious
gloved hands reach to her hair and cut off a clump with scissors
a conjuring pile has been made containing a small animals heart with an iron nail through it
katrinas hair is added and the pile is lit to burn
nearby young masbath watches on his belly with his hands tied behind his back
lady van tassel whispers over the fire her white horse tied nearby
she looks to katrina who stirs
lady van tassel takes the horsemans skull from a bag over her shoulder places the skull in the flames
thunder is heard
lady van tassel looks up smiles
the wind tosses leaves in swirls
the twisted tree opens wide with a rumble shafts of light shooting out
ichabod drives the coach hard ahead
katrina sits up groggy
lady van tassel looks down at her
you are alive
or are you and young masbath dead along with me
katrina sees young masbath and beyond him the dying fire
she commands the horseman
and quite beautifully done wouldnt you say
it is almost over
wind starts to pick up
of the wind he rides tonight
father saw you die
he saw me thrown
saw the horseman looming over me as i fled
things i wanted him to see
but as long as i govern the horseman he cannot harm me
baltus did not stay enough to see that
he ran as a coward unfettered by my fate
then whose body was it
the precious servant girl sarah
i killed her and kept her body hidden till i needed it
and when i return to the hollow tomorrow my version of the truth will come to pass
faking meekness i mean there i was that fateful day following baltus into the woods
i did not know what he was up to
where he was going
i worried for his safety
katrina cautiously moves the hand shes supporting herself with feels a rock and clutches it
imagine my surprise finding him on a liason with a common servant
a girl who had apparently become his secret love
no one will believe your lies whore
this whore will see your mouth shut forever very soon
i am not going to kill you
she picks up the horsemans skull in her gloved hand
he will have that honor
the horseman rides daredevil a freight train of moldering flesh heading towards a chasm with no bridge
they reach it galloping in mid air to the other side
ichabod guides the coach into the van tassel orchard
lady van tassel admires the skull
mock sorrow woe is me
that spying on my husband in his filthy indiscretion i saw he and sarah attacked by the horseman
oh pity me
so overcome was i that i wandered in the western woods
nearly blind from terror
lady van tassel crouches rubbing dirt on her face
and tomorrow is my grand performance having barely survived the elements
more emoting by sheer luck i found my way back to the hollow
what do i find here
my dear sweet step daughter katrina is dead
why has god forsaken her
seeing that lady van tassel lavish attention on katrina masbath takes this opportunity to ease onto his knees
of herself pleased no one will suspect this sad woman who has been through such an ordeal
with only the empty solace of her money and land to comfort her
ichabod leaps from the coach bounds up the porch
ichabod is heard
lady van tassel turns astonished
katrina slings the rock strikes lady van tassel in the head a glancing blow that knocks her down
katrina grips young masbath helping him up
but lady van tassel scrambles up grabs katrina and throws her back to the ground
lady van tassel steps hard on katrinas ankle touches her forehead bleeding pissed
youve been a naughty girl
young masbath leaps to action charging head first slams into lady van tassel sends her backwards
katrina runs and pulls masbath up
lady van tassel rolls recovering not very concerned
ichabod comes out the open front doors
far away ichabod
ichabod climbs back on the coach taking off
katrina and young masbath run out from a line of trees
here we are
behind in the forest lady van tassel rides her white horse in no hurry
wind kicks hard
hoofbeats are heard
fast as your pretty legs will carry you
it makes no difference
on the lawn ichabod drives towards katrina and masbath
behind at the tree line lady van tassel holds up the horsemans skull wind tossing her dress and hair
nothing will stop him now
at mid field ichabod reaches katrina and masbath
lady van tassel
with katrina and masbath on board ichabod turns the coach
katrina unties masbaths hands
hoofbeats get louder
olly olly oxen free
ichabod looks back towards lady van tassel
at the treeline the horseman breaks into the open hell on horseback
full speed ahead
the coach hits the long straight road away from the house
katrina and masbath hold on as the coach shakes violently
where are we going
i do not know
here he comes
behind the horseman can be seen on the forest bordered road
we might make it to the church
masbath takes a lantern crawls back to the roof
he ignores reaching the rear of the coach and throwing the lantern at the horseman
it smashes on the trail
damn it boy get back here
young masbath slides back
katrina helps him
what can we do
take the reins
young masbath takes them
ichabod slings van rippers rifle over his shoulder and starts back
katrina grips him
masbath is right
we must do something
ichabod gets to the luggage area at the rear struggling to open a storage box
behind the horseman draws his sword closer
ichabod opens the box hefting out a long jagged saw
the horseman rides up swinging
ichabod recoils thwack just missed by sword
the horseman lets the coach get ahead shifting to the other side of the trail
coming along side
ichabod backpedals looking to masbath
keep him off
masbath guides the horses over
the horseman must fall behind to avoid the wheels
the coach hits a large fallen tree trunk
ichabod bounces falling
he hangs off the side of the coach
katrina climbs to offer her hand
ichabod offers the saw
katrina takes the saw
now with both hands ichabod tries for better purchase
he grips the coach door
ichabod clings to the open door as branches slam him
hes reaching to the coach threshold reaching
ichabod pulls himself inside
boom the door hits a tree trunk bashed to pieces
ichabod looks out from the coach dazed
katrina looks back as young masbath guides the coach to block the horseman again
the horseman sheaths his sword riding
reaching to grip the back corner of the coach
the horseman dismounts clinging climbing
ichabod takes the rifle off his shoulder aiming
splattering the horsemans hand point blank
the horseman hangs on with his other hand
the horseman re grips with the blasted hand amazing since its now all mush and bone
ichabod throws the rifle on his way to the drivers perch taking the saw from katrina
katrina looks to the horses then at ichabod
ichabod takes the reins from young masbath
reins in one hand and saw in the other ichabod waits
the horseman rises up and moves in taking out his sword
young masbath climbs down to the wooden pole connecting the coach to the bridles puts out his hand
katrina takes it
behind the horseman swings
ichabod blocks with the saw
young masbath guides katrina as she leaps onto one horse
young masbath straddles the horse beside her
the horseman swings backhanded knocks the sword from ichabods hand as ichabod falls back
ichabod hits the bridle post hanging onto straps for dear life
his feet drag on the trail
above the horseman comes to the drivers perch close enough to kill katrina
he raises his sword
katrina screams ducking helpless
below ichabod pulls a bolt from the coachs hitching rod
he shoves off with his feet
the horseman swings
the horses detach from the coach dragging ichabod along
the coach careens out of control
it flies off the trail hits an incline and sails off throwing the horseman
the coach hits a tree trunk and smashes
further down the trail the coach horses stop
young masbath and katrina climb off as ichabod gets to his feet hurting clutching his previously wounded shoulder
i doubt thats the end
he moves too fast
ichabod unhooks a lantern off the bridle rail
the trail behind is silent till a bone chilling screech is heard
what was that
they start moving
ichabod looks around
through the tree line the hollows massive windmill can be seen against the sky
katrina and young masbath run
ichabod katrina and young masbath book into this open area heading to the windmill
another horrible squeal echoes
ichabod looks over his shoulder
heavy low hanging branches and vines at the forest edge creep to life parting
forming a sort of black tunnel
the horseman gallops out throwing leaves in his wake
the horseman readies a battle axe
ichabod gets under the windmill helping young masbath up the ladder and in
the horseman is almost there
ichabod follows katrina
he gets in feet dangling
the horseman dismounts
ichabod leaps up and struggles with the heavy trap door
he closes the latch just as the horseman hits
the door buckles
it wont hold
ichabod goes to a large grindstone against a wall
he struggles to roll it
young masbath helps him roll it to the trap door
it falls on top with a thud
the horsemans sword jabs up through the grindstones center hole
the sword withdraws
a pounding begins
the horseman chops at the door with his axe
the grindstone shifts
katrina and young masbath back away
ichabod holds his lantern up desperate for ideas searching
above to the right is the milling platform where grain is ground and bagged
to the left is the crooked staircase
ichabod picks up a bailing hook a plan forming
he gives his lantern to katrina and points
get up those stairs
open the door to the roof and wait
katrina and young masbath obey
ichabod crosses and climbs the ladder to the milling platform
he grasps a wooden lever pulling it
gears above begin to turn
the windmills rotors creak to life spinning
under the windmill the horseman keeps chopping
his axe exposes grindstone throwing sparks
katrina looks down from the stairs
the horsemans axe pries at the seam of the trap door
i will follow
ichabod pulls bags of grain lining them up at the edge of the milling platform
under his breath hopefully
above young masbath reaches the ceiling throws open the door to the roof
below ichabod cuts holes into the grain bags so milled grain spills out and falls to the floor creating dust
he grabs one open bag and dumps it
more grain dust
masbath and katrina come out
rotors spin behind them
ichabod sees below
the horseman sticks a hand through trying to push the grindstone aside then withdrawing
the racking axe continues
wont be long
ichabod grabs one half full bag of grain swings it with effort throws
the bag smashes on the grindstone busting the door
the grindstone falls through slamming the horseman down
ichabod slices into a sack hanging from a pulley system
more and more dust rises
below the horseman enters
katrina shouts from above
the horseman moves toward the ladder milling platform ladder but ichabod grabs it pulling it up
the horseman just misses the final rung
ichabod throws the ladder aside as the horseman backs off
ichabod looks to the staircase
no way to climb down from the milling platform and get there
the horseman runs and leaps grabbing a hanging chain
the horseman climbs the chain swinging
ichabod runs across the platform jumps
ichabod grasps the frail rail of the staircase barely
the rail creaks about to break
behind the horseman lands on the milling platform
ichabod is losing grip
young masbath races down the stairs grabs his hand
he pulls ichabod up
ichabods pistol slips from its holster and falls
ichabod and young masbath look
the horseman following ichabods lead runs across the milling platform and leaps
grabs the staircase rail only a few feet from ichabod and masbath
ichabod kicks the rail breaking it
the horseman falls in billowing dust crashing below
ichabod pushes masbath up the stairs
katrina helps them onto the roof
quickly close it
takes lantern points get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump
the horseman runs agile up stairs
ichabod shepherds katrina and young masbath to the edge where the rotors spin close
the blades will carry us to the ground
face front and wait for me
i cant do this
we have no choice
ichabod moves back to the trap door
katrina and young masbath look at the rotors and down at the long distance between them and the ground
ichabod throws the lantern into the windmill and runs
the horseman continues up
the lantern falls past
young masbath jumps
ichabod grips katrina and jumps
they hit one rotor and cling to the frame and cloth
the rotor begins its downwards swing
the lantern hits the ground and shatters
grain dust is consumed instantaneously flames roar upwards filling the windmill
engulfing the horseman
the rotor is halfway to its lowest point
masbath katrina and ichabod hang on as the entire structure trembles
boom flames shoot out the windows doors and seams lighting up the night
on the rattling rotor ichabod struggles to hold the frame with one hand and keep a grip on katrina
ichabod releases katrina then drops
they hit the ground
ichabod rolls gasping holding his shoulder
they all look at each other in disbelief a moment
ichabod lets out a sort of rasping laugh standing
ichabod ushers them across the field uphill
lightning flashes across the sky
a bolt strikes the windmill and it explodes
the rotors bust apart
splinters of burning wood spin all directions
across the field ichabod katrina and young masbath keep running
there is a wooden cart parked ahead
in the windmill rubble the horseman rises shoving off burning debris
his flame ravaged uniform smolders
across the field ichabod stumbles onwards but notices something horrible
in the distance lady van tassels white horse roams free
as this registers oh no
young masbath and katrina are just past the cart when lady van tassel rises from behind it swings a plank
slams ichabod in the chest and sends him down
lady van tassel grabs katrinas hair drags her
should have stayed away constable
ichabod gets up slow furious reaches to his holster only to find it empty
he moves forward
keep back or i kill her
she takes out scissors holds them to katrinas neck
katrina ceases struggling
ichabod keeps masbath behind him keeps his distance
lady van tassel shoots a glance
par off the horseman strides from the wreckage
you cannot kill what is already dead
let her go
i think i will
lady van tassel spins and throws katrina in the cart shoving against it
the cart rolls downhill
ichabod moves forward
lady van tassel turns brandishing the scissors slashing and missing
ichabod backs off
downhill the cart picks up speed headed for the horseman
the horseman starts running to meet it
uphill lady van tassel grins
say goodbye to her
lady van tassel lunges stabbing
ichabod avoids puts all his fury behind his fist punches her in the face
lady van tassel hits the ground and her bag falls open sending the horsemans skull rolling out
the skull rolls
landing far away
downhill katrina leaps out from the cart
she lands hard
the horseman shoves the empty cart aside still on the move
uphill ichabod sees the skull
he runs towards it
lady van tassel grabs ichabod by the ankle
downhill katrina runs back
the horseman is catching up
uphill ichabod tries to pull f ree from lady van tassel
young masbath comes behind her bam hits her in the head with the wooden plank
ichabod scrambles to his feet
downhill the horseman catches katrina taking her by the hair as she falls to her knees and screams
uphill ichabod runs
grasps the horsemans skull
he runs towards the horseman and katrina
downhill katrina struggles but the horseman holds her ready by her hair
raises his sword
uphill ichabod throws the skull
the skull spins through the air
the horseman drops katrina reaches up
catches the skull
ichabod runs to meet her grabs her as she falls exhausted
together they back away from the horseman
the horseman holds the skull out then brings it to his shoulders to its rightful place
transformation begins blood and flesh rise up from the horsemans throat and grip the skull
young masbath drops the plank watching in awe
the horsemans reformation continues
liquids become solids
he is made whole once more the same evil human face we saw in baltus stories
he looks to ichabod and katrina touches his restored face
daredevil rides up screeching
the horseman replaces his sward and climbs into the saddle
he rides towards katrina and ichabod but passes them by
they are so exhausted they fall down
young masbath backs up as the horseman comes but the horseman does not want him either
the horseman leans to grab lady van tassels unconscious form pulls her up across daredevils back
he rides away with her
ichabod and katrina watch him go
they look at each other then kiss gratefully
ichabod looks to young masbath
how are you
ichabod smiles and holds out his arm
masbath comes over
lightning brightens the farmland around them
the horseman enters the clearing keeping a hand on lady van tassel
ahead the twisted tree awaits
lady van tassel is awakening face bloody
she turns her head and looks forward
the twisted trees wound opens wide and glowing
daredevil picks up speed
daredevil leaps just as a lightning bolt blasts down striking the horseman
for an instant horseman and horse are transformed skeletons of light entering the tree
silence and smoke
at the tree lady van tassels hand sticks out from the tight shut suture
the sewn wound on her palm seeps blood
a bright busy day in new york
a coach pulls up to ichabods home
ichabod is the driver
he gets off goes and opens the coach door
he helps katrina down
next young masbath sticks his head out
ichabod goes about unloading bags
katrina holds young masbaths hand and they look down the street in wonder
