written by john logan music and lyrics by stephen sondheim adapted from the stage musical sweeney todd the demon barber of fleet street music and lyrics by stephen sondheim book
by hugh wheeler based on a version of sweeney todd by christopher bond th december foreboding organ music is heard
we are looking down at a rough brick floor
is it an alley
a cobblestone street
were not sure
the flickering glow of flame is the only illumination
the ominous organ music continues as
from the bottom of the frame
a dark pool of blood slowly begins to spread
moving up the frame defying gravity
the flickering flame reflected in the blood
finally the pool of blood fills the entire frame
a shrill factory whistle blows enormously loud blood chilling and spine shattering the whistle is a bizarre combination of sound a factory whistle a hog being slaughtered a dog snarling
a roaring inferno a human scream and a mans face appears upside down reflected in the pool of blood
he is the gentleman a slender dandy in pearl grey gloves and matching waistcoat
a cold and superior aristocrat
the camera slowly revolves the gentleman becoming right side up as attend the tale of sweeney todd
his skin was pale and his eye was odd
he shaved the faces of gentlemen who never thereafter were heard of again
he trod a path that few have trod did sweeney todd the demon barber of fleet street
we cut from the blood to see the gentleman standing before us
we are in an eerie dark chamber unclear a low ceiling a world of silhouettes and shadows
another figure emerges from the miasma of shadows into the hellish flickering of flame the banker
he is large rotund and sleek
he kept a shop in london town of fancy clients and good renown and what if none of their souls were saved
they went to their maker impeccably shaved
more figures begin to emerge from the shadows joining the gentleman and the banker as
by sweeney by sweeney todd the demon barber of fleet street
although prosaic in appearance these figures are in fact swing your razor wide sweeney
hold it to the skies
freely flows the blood of those who moralize
as they continue the new figures become more distinct
the general a tough leather skinned military man in a crimson imperial uniform
his needs were few his room was bare the priest a lean severe man with pale skin in clerical attire
a lavabo and a fancy chair
the tourist a small meek man with glasses in an ill fitting suit
a mug of suds and a leather strop an apron a towel a pail and a mop
the student a dashing young man from oxford with luxurious long hair
for neatness he deserves a nod does sweeney todd
the demon barber of fleet street
the ghosts are a bit more insinuating now as they move around this mysterious world
variously inconspicuous sweeney was quick and quiet and clean e was
back of his smile under his word sweeney heard music that nobody heard
sweeney pondered and sweeney planned like a perfect machine e planned sweeney was smooth sweeney was subtle sweeney would blink and rats would scuttle
the specters are becoming more insistent their strange impassivity giving way to accusation as the flickering red flame becomes an inferno variously sweeney was smooth sweeney was subtle sweeney would
blink and rats would scuttle
inconspicuous sweeney was quick and quiet and clean e was like a perfect machine e was was sweeney
on this explosive note we revolve away from the ghostly furies to discover sweeney todd
standing before us
an unclear figure silhouetted in blazing red flames
we slowly push in on him as attend the tale of sweeney todd
he served a dark and a vengeful god
what happened then well whos to say
and he wouldnt want us to give it away variously not sweeney not sweeney todd the demon barber of fleet street
on this note we push in tight on the figure of todd
music and the clanging of a clock tower bell are heard as we slowly begin pulling back and are imperceptibly transported to
anthony a young sailor of about is standing at the rail of a ship
we see the obscure shape of rigging and sails behind him
the cries of sailors echo
behind him stand the gentleman and the banker
they are looking past anthony looking at something
they move away as anthony peers through the fog straining to see
gradually as the ship approaches the towering spires and mountainous rooftops of the city begin to stand out in relief to emerge through the fog like a tiger creeping toward
music continues as anthony takes in the dreadful and magnificent spectacle of the th century metropolis
the gnarl of rooftops
the labyrinth of streets and alleys
the black trails of smoke reaching up like skeletal fingers from a thousand chimneys
anthony is awestruck
i have sailed the world beheld its wonders from the dardanelles to the mountains of peru but theres no place like london
then sweeney todd steps to anthonys side grimly interrupting no theres no place like london
you are young
life has been kind to you
you will learn
todds glares forward his haunted gaze never leaving the approaching city
music continues as todd stands very still and takes in the shadowy figures on the docks
anthony seems almost lost at his side overwhelmed by the scale and aura of the city
takes your breath away doesnt it
todd shudders violently almost snarling
theres a hole in the world like a great black pit and the vermin of the world inhabit it and its morals arent worth what a pig could spit and
it goes by the name of london
at the top of the hole sit the privileged few making mock of the vermin in the lower zoo turning beauty into filth and greed
i too have sailed the world and seen its wonders for the cruelty of men is as wondrous as peru but theres no place like london
anthony looks at his friend mystified by his grim reaction to the city
i beg your indulgence anthony
my mind is far from easy
in these once familiar streets i feel shadows everywhere
anthony looking at him questioning
todd continues quietly there was a barber and his wife and she was beautiful a foolish barber and his wife she was his reason and his life and she was
beautiful and she was virtuous
and he was
a breath naive
anthony watches rapt as todd remembers
fifteen years before
todd walks with his beautiful wife lucy through a crowded flower market a colorful explosion of blossoms
lucy carries their one year old baby johanna
todd is almost unrecognizable to us content and smiling
chatting with his wife
there was another man who saw that she was beautiful a pious vulture of the law who with a gesture of his claw removed the barber from his plate
then there was nothing but to wait and she would fall so soft so young so lost and oh so beautiful
during the above judge turpin an elderly man with a saturnine demeanor eyes lucy through the luxurious bunches of flowers
he stalks her desiring her
with the judge is his nefarious creature beadle bamford
the beadle is a large man his florid nature and pink powdered face never quite disguising his lethality
the judge whispers to the beadle indicating todd
then the beadle and several policemen sweep in and drag todd off
the judge moves in on lucy like a predator
and we return to
and the lady sir
did she succumb
oh that was many years ago
i doubt if anyone would know
a quiet beat
i owe you my life anthony
if you hadnt spotted me i would be lost on the ocean still
todd picks up his duffel bag preparing to go
will i see you again
you might find me if you like around fleet street
until then my friend
he offers his hand
todd takes it and shakes
then todd quickly turns and goes
anthony stands for a moment saddened by the mysterious pall that hangs over his friend
todd strides along deep in thought
the emotions roiling within him finally seethe out in a dark mutter theres a hole in the world like a great black pit and its filled with people who are
filled with shit and the vermin of the world inhabit it
he disappears down the street as the music thunders we zoom ahead of todd cutting through the city at lightning pace down twisting alleys and up crowded boulevards into tunnels
and over bridges slashing through london at breakneck speed the insane explosion of music sending us hurtling to fleet street
we see the exterior of mrs
lovetts pie shop
it is tatty and unloved by all
yet it has a strange ghostly presence to it
imposing and dead at the same time
there is an exterior staircase leading up to a darkened second floor room with a window overlooking the street
the music slows and continues as we see todd standing in front of the shop considering it deeply
the general we saw before passes glancing at todd
here and then gone
todd finally strides to the shop and enters
behind the dusty counter is
lovett a venal vigorous and slatternly woman in her s
she is currently busy chopping a loathsome mess of suet with a wicked looking knife her greasy hair hanging down over her face
the moment todd enters and the bell at the door sounds her head snaps up and her eyes are on him like a bird of prey a customer
todd is startled starts to go wait
whats yer rush
whats yer hurry
she sticks the knife into the counter you gave me such a wipes her hands on her apron fright
i thought you was a ghost
half a minute cantcher
sit ye down
an order sit
he obeys all i meant is that i havent seen a customer for weeks
did you come here for a pie sir
she flicks a bit of dust off a pie with a rag do forgive me if me heads a little vague ugh
she plucks something off the pie examines it what is that
but youd think we had the plague she drops it on the floor and stamps on it from the way that people she flicks something off the pie with her
finger keep avoiding spotting it moving no you dont
she smacks it with her hand heaven knows i try sir
lifts her hand looks at it tsk
she wipes it on the edge of the counter but theres no one comes in even to inhale tsk
she blows the last dust off the pie as she brings it to him right you are sir
would you like a drop of ale
todd nods mind you i cant hardly blame them pouring a tankard of ale these are probably the worst pies in london
i know why nobody cares to take them i should know i make them
no the worst pies in london even thats polite
the worst pies in london if you doubt it take a bite
its horrible is that just disgusting
you have to concede it
its nothing but crusting here drink this youll need it she gives him the ale the worst pies in london
during the following she slams lumps of dough on the counter and rolls them out grunting frequently as she goes and no wonder with the price of meat what it
is grunt when you get it
grunt never grunt thought id live to see the day mend think it was a treat finding poor grunt animals grunt wot are dying in the street
mooney has a pie shop does a business but i noticed something weird lately all her neighbors cats have disappeared
shrugs have to hand it to her wot i calls enterprise popping pussies into pies
wouldnt do in my shop just the thought of its enough to make you sick
and im telling you them pussy cats is quick
leans on counter exhausted no denying times is hard sir even harder than the worst pies in london
only lard and nothing more as todd gamely tries another mouthful is that just revolting
all greasy and gritty it looks like its molting and tastes like well pity a woman alone with limited wind and the worst pies in london
sighs heavily ah sir times is hard
times is hard
she finishes one of the crusts with a flourish as the music ends
todd meanwhile is gulping at his ale trying to wash down mrs
lovetts hideous creation
trust me dearie its going to take more than ale to wash that taste out
come with me and well get you a nice tumbler of gin
she leads him through the curtains at the back of the pie shop and into
her parlor is a wonder of seedy faux middle class victoriana
little knickknacks dusty plants and dingy doilies
there is a threadbare mauve sofa in front of a comfortable fire
a faded picture postcard of the seaside hangs on a wall
she goes to a sideboard and pours him a huge glass of gin as isnt this homey now
me cheery wallpaper was a real bargain too it being only partly singed when the chapel burnt down
she hands him the gin
he gulps it down washing the taste of her pie out of his mouth
theres a good boy now you sit down and warm your bones you look chilled through
he sits before the fire isnt that a room over the shop
if times are so hard why dont you rent it out
she glances up at the roof considering the room over them
oh no one will go near it
she turns to him something a little intense and probing about her gaze
people think its haunted
she holds his gaze
and whos to say theyre wrong
you see years ago something happened up there
something not very nice
the flickering flame from the fire begins to cast a more intense red glow on her face
there was a barber and his wife and he was beautiful a proper artist with a knife but they transported him for life
sighs and he was beautiful
the music continues as she looks at him again with that rather intense gaze barker his name was benjamin barker
what was his crime
with an edge foolishness
she turns again to the fire the red glow bathing her face as she remembers
lucy is pacing holding baby johanna to her closely
lucy is distraught strained tears in her eyes
as lucy paces we notice the room is full of dead and dying flowers dozens of dried bouquets tossed aside and ignored
he had this wife you see pretty little thing silly little nit had her chance for the moon on a string poor thing
lucy moves to the window looks out
she sees judge turpin and the beadle waiting below
the judge holds yet another bouquet
there was this judge you see wanted her like mad every day hed send her a flower but did she come down from her tower
sat up there and sobbed by the hour poor fool
lucy moves away from the window sobbing
ah but there was worse yet to come poor thing
the beadle is leading a nervous lucy along an exclusive street of dark stone mansions grand but somehow menacing
lucy is wearing her best dress
the beadle calls on her all polite poor thing poor thing
the judge he tells her is all contrite he blames himself for her dreadful plight she must come straight to his house tonight
poor thing poor thing
the beadle ushers lucy into a ballroom
she is shocked to see a fancy dress ball in progress
masked couples swirl around the ballroom their number sinisterly multiplied by the distorting mirrors that frame the room
the hanging chandeliers draped in red cloth cast a disquieting incarnadine glow on the proceedings
of course when she goes there poor thing poor thing theyre having this ball all in masks
lucy wanders lost through the swirling dancers they buffet her confusing her
theres no one she knows there poor dear poor thing she wanders tormented and drinks poor thing
the judge has repented she thinks poor thing
oh where is judge turpin
the beadle finds lucy again and graciously gives her his arm leading her through the party
she is thankful for the salvation he provides
he brings her to judge turpin
the judge descends on lucy raping her
the other guests crowd around ravenously enjoying the spectacle
a feverish nightmare
he was there all right only not so contrite
she wasnt no match for such craft you see and everyone thought it so droll
they figured she had to be daft you see so all of em stood there and laughed you see poor soul
todds wild howl shatters the memory and tears us back to todd is bolting up from the sofa tormented he stands for a terrible beat
would no one have mercy on her
so it is you benjamin barker
wheres my wife
she poisoned herself
arsenic from the apothecary on the corner
i tried to stop her but she wouldnt listen to me
and hes got your daughter
adopted her like his own
todd absorbs this sickening news
fifteen years of sweating in a living hell on a false charge
fifteen years dreaming that i might come home to find a loving wife and child
a beat as he stares into the fire madness and purpose creeping in
well i cant say the years have been particularly kind to you mr
barker but you still no not barker
that man is dead
its todd now
and he will have his revenge
he continues with a chilling and quiet resolve as he stares with unblinking eyes into the fire judge turpin and the beadle will pay for what they did
he finally turns to her
first i must have my shop back
they emerge from the pie shop
she begins to scale the exterior staircase to the darkened second floor room
she continues up he slowly follows
a macabre shroud of dust and spiders webs
furniture covered in sheets
a broken mirror on one wall
we hear footsteps approaching and then mrs
the door creaks like a living thing
not to worry a touch of oil will put that right
she turns back to todd nothing to be afraid of love come in
she moves into the room
but todd hesitates at the door looking into the room
for him this is a truly haunted place
meanwhile she kneels and pries loose a floorboard
underneath there is a hidden area
within that something covered with a velvet cloth
she removes it and carefully unwraps it
her touch is particularly gentle and respectful
we discover it is a fine leather case
she looks at it for a beat
then turns to him dusting it off
i dont believe it
he finally steps into the room drawn toward the case
when they came for the girl i hid em
i thought who knows
maybe the silly blighterll be back again
cracked in the head wasnt i
haunting music begins as she opens the case
and we see it contains a beautiful set of razors
he stands for a long moment gazing down at his beloved razors
those handles is chased silver aint they
these are my friends see how they glisten
he picks up a small razor see this one shine how he smiles in the light
my friend my faithful friend
holding it to his ear feeling the edge with his thumb speak to me friend whisper ill listen
listening i know i know youve been locked out of sight all these years like me my friend
well ive come home to find you waiting
home and were together and well do wonders wont we
lovett leans over him in her own kind of trance as well
they now sing simultaneously picking out a larger razor you there my friend come let me hold you
now with a sigh you grow warm in my hand my friend my clever friend
putting it back rest now my friends
soon ill unfold you
soon youll know splendors you never have dreamed all your days im your friend too mr
if you only knew mr
todd ooh mr
todd youre warm in my hand
youve come home
always had a fondness for you i did
my lucky friends
till now your shine was merely silver
friends you shall drip rubies youll soon drip precious rubies
never you fear mr
todd you can move in here mr
splendors you never have dreamed all your days will be yours
im your friend
and youre mine
dont they shine beautiful
silvers good enough for me mr
the music continues quietly as todd stares at one of his razors
leave me now
todd finally picks up his biggest razor and slowly opens it looks at it
at last my arm is complete again
and he remains standing
then in the shattered mirror on the wall he suddenly sees the distorted reflections of the gentleman the banker and the general looking at him lift your razor high sweeney
hear it singing yes
sink it in the rosy skin of righteousness
todd turns to them
variously his voice was soft his manner mild
he seldom laughed but he often smiled hed seen how civilized men behave
he never forgot and he never forgave not sweeney not sweeney todd the demon barber of fleet street
todd pulls a sheet off baby johannas cradle
a cloud of dust rises
the ghosts disappear in the cloud of dust and todd stands alone staring at the cradle holding his razor
anthony now out of his sailors uniform is walking along the sidewalk near the judges mansion absorbed in a copy of baedekers london
he stops lost trying to get his bearings studying his map
then an unusual sound emerges through the normal cosmopolitan bustle
it is the sound of a woman humming
he looks up to see
johanna a year old girl with golden hair beautiful and hauntingly sad
she sits at her window above behind bars humming to herself as she does needlepoint
anthony watches her absolutely mesmerized
johanna notices a bird seller passing
he carries a long wooden pole with little bird cages attached
green finch and linnet bird nightingale blackbird how is it you sing
how can you jubilate sitting in cages never taking wing
outside the sky waits beckoning beckoning just beyond the bars
how can you remain staring at the rain maddened by the stars
how is it you sing anything
how is it you sing
she sees anthony on the sidewalk below
there is a long look between them
her intense melancholy expression moves him
she continues singing the strange anguish and yearning of her words seem intended only for him
my cage has many rooms damask and dark
nothing there sings not even my lark
larks never will you know when theyre captive
teach me to be more adaptive
green finch and linnet bird nightingale blackbird teach me how to sing
if i cannot fly let me sing
then she turns away quickly alarmed when someone enters her room
she looks terrified
below anthony is concerned for her
he sees her move from the window
he is craning to see better when a beggar woman a filthy tendril of a woman her foul clothes of rags like a second skin suddenly thrusts her arm up
from the curb imploring alms
for a miserable woman on a miserable chilly morning
anthony drops a coin into her hand thank yer sir thank yer
maam could tell me whose house this is
thats the great judge turpins house that is
and the young lady who resides there
thats johanna his pretty little ward
keeps her snug he does all locked up
so dont you go trespassing there or its a good whipping for you or any other young man with mischief on his mind
she suddenly leers into a lewd and demented assault ow would you like a little muff dear a little jig jig a little bounce around the bush
wouldnt you like to push me parsley
it looks to me dear like you got plenty there to push
she grabs at anthonys crotch anthony starts back she turns away instantly plaintive again and appeals to other pedestrians as she goes alms
for a desperate woman
anthony considers the mansion
he sees a figure standing at a window unclear behind the shutters watching him
he sits on a bench outside the mansion and sings quietly i feel you johanna i feel you
i was half convinced id waken satisfied enough to dream you
happily i was mistaken johanna
ill steal you johanna ill steal you
then the figure disappears from the window above
anthony stands waits
then the doors to the mansion swing open
anthony is expecting johanna
but it is judge turpin the predator we met in todds flashback who steps into the doorway
he seems a different man now
paternal and warm he smiles and beckons to anthony
anthony hesitates unsure
the judge beckons again
again the warm smile
come in lad
anthony goes into the mansion
judge turpin leads anthony into the dark library filled with books
anthony is looking around for johanna
he is wary this is all very strange
you were looking for hyde park you say
yes its terribly large on the map but i keep getting lost
sit down lad sit down
anthony sits uncomfortable as the judge pours two snifters of brandy
its embarrassing for a sailor to lose his bearings but well there you are
the large form of the beadle appears from the shadows
no introduction is made
anthony glances to him uneasy
a sailor eh
the bountiful out of plymouth
handing him a snifter of brandy a sailor must know the ways of the world yes
must be practiced in the ways of the world
would you say you are practiced boy
the judge moves to consider some beautiful volumes bound in the richest leather
he runs a finger along the spines of the books his large library of pornography
the geishas of japan
the concubines of siam
the catamites of greece
the harlots of india
i have them all here
drawings of them
judge contd he turns again to anthony all the vile things youve done with your whores
anthony is speechless
the judge just smiles at him amiably
would you like to see
standing i think theres been some mistake oh i think not
you gandered at my ward johanna
you gandered at her yes sir you gandered
the beadle moves behind anthony
glancing nervously back at the beadle i meant no harm your meaning is immaterial
mark me if i see your face again on this street youll rue the day your bitch of a mother gave you birth
anthony is stunned
the judge proceeds with shocking venom my johanna isnt one of your bloody cock chafers
my johanna is not to be gandered at
he nods to the beadle the beadle instantly grabs anthony and brutally hauls him out
the beadle drags anthony through a rear door of the mansion and flings him into a filthy alley
anthony pulls himself up
hyde park is that way young sir
a right and then a left then straight on you see
beadle contd points over there
flustered anthony turns to look the instant anthonys back is turned the beadle swings his lethal billyclub and slams him from behind brutally in the kidneys anthonys knees buckle the
beadle then slams anthony across the back of the neck anthony falls hard the beadle then uses one dainty foot to roll anthony over anthony gazes up at him panting for breath in agony you heard judge turpin little man
he presses the end of his billyclub into anthonys forehead grinding it hard next time itll be your pretty brains all over the pavement
with that the beadle returns to the mansion and slams the door
anthony slowly pulls himself to his knees doubled over coughing up blood
a long beat as anthony gets his breath wiping blood from his face
still doubled over he sings with burning intensity ill steal you johanna ill steal you
do they think that walls can hide you
even now im at your window
i am in the dark beside you buried sweetly in your yellow hair
he pulls himself up every movement is agony
he makes his way down the alley leaning on the wall for support
the music swells as anthony emerges from the dark alley into the bright sunlight
he makes his way along the sidewalk i feel you johanna and one day ill steal you
till im with you then im with you there sweetly buried in your yellow hair
the soaring music continues as anthony stops at a park across the street from turpins mansion bravely gazing up at johannas window
sweeney todd and mrs
lovett are moving quickly she struggles to keep up with his long loping stride
he carries his razor case she carries a shopping basket
hes here every thursday
all the rage he is
not for long
they round a corner and move into the bustling marketplace
a steady mercantile hum as the cries of merchants and wandering coster mongers fill the air
todd and mrs
lovett move toward a hand drawn caravan dominating one corner of the marketplace
it is painted like a sicilian donkey cart and on its side a sign declaims signor adolfo pirelli haircutter to his royal majesty the king of naples
do you really think you can do it
by tomorrow theyll all be flocking to me like sheep to be shorn he stops abruptly when he sees the beadle casually strolling through the crowd
todd is transfixed his ancient enemy so close
seeing the beadle pulling his arm come along now dear he might recognize you i will do what i have vowed to do
he continues to glare at the beadle his voice low come closer my friend closer
then toby a year old boy a bit small for his age malnourished and consumptively pale emerges from pirellis caravan
he bangs on a tin drum drawing customers
a crowd begins to gather at the caravan as ladies and gentlemen
may i have your attention perlease
do you wake every morning in shame and despair to discover your pillow is covered with hair wot ought not to be there
well ladies and gentlemen from now on you can waken at ease
you need never again have a worry or care i will show you a miracle marvelous rare gentlemen you are about to see something wot rose from the dead
a woman gasps he smiles and wiggles a finger no on the top of my head
he dramatically doffs his cap revealing mountains of hair which cascade to his shoulder
twas pirellis miracle elixir thats wot did the trick sir true sir true
was it quick sir
did it in a tick sir
just like an elixir ought to do
to a bald man how about a bottle mister
only costs a penny guaranteed
pours a drop on the bald mans head does pirellis stimulate the growth sir
you can have my oath sir tis unique
applies the bald mans hand to the wet spot rub a minute stimulatin in it
soon youll have to thin it once a week
more customers are stepping up and buying bottles
todd opens a bottle of the elixir takes a whiff
he smiles to mrs
lovett his plan falling into place
loudly to mrs
lovett pardon me maam whats that awful stench
are we standing near an open trench
to a woman in the crowd must be standing near an open trench
the crowd responds to todd and mrs
lovett looking askance and sniffing at the bottles
toby nervously tries to distract them buy pirellis miracle elixir anything wots slick sir soon sprouts curls
when they see how thick sir you can have your pick sir of the girls
want to buy a bottle missus
sniffing bottle of elixir what is this
sniffing another customers bottle what is this
smells like piss
smells like phew
this is piss
piss with ink
the music speeds up toby is getting desperate let pirellis activate your roots sir keep it off your boots sir eats right through
yes get pirellis
use a bottle of it
ladies seem to love it flies do too
suddenly the curtains on the caravan are dramatically flung wide to reveal pirelli a flamboyant italian with a velvet suit thick wavy hair and a dazzling smile
pirelli poses splendidly for a moment
then i am adolfo pirelli da king of da barbers da barber of kings e buon giorno good day i blow you a kiss
he does so and i da so famous pirelli i wish a to know a who has a da nerve a to say my elixir is piss
who says this
todd moves forward boldly
i am mr
sweeney todd of fleet street
i have opened a bottle of pirellis elixir and i say to you that it is nothing but an arrant fraud concocted from piss and ink
the crowd gasps
pirelli is about to respond outraged but todd continues and furthermore signor i have serviced no kings yet i wager i can shave a cheek with ten times more dexterity
that any street mountebank
he snaps open his razor case and holds it up for the crowd to see turning to display the wondrous razors you see these razors
to the crowd the finest in england
glaring at pirelli i lay them against five pounds you are no match for me
you hear me sir
either accept my challenge or reveal yourself as a sham
the crowd is enjoying this now whispering eagerly about the bold challenge
in the crowd we see a quick flash of the meek tourist we saw earlier
pirelli studies the razors for a moment and then turns to the crowd with a confident smile you hear zis foolish man
watch and see how he will regret his folly
music begins as todd moves into action preparing the challenge friends whos for a free shave
two men step forward
a plain wooden chair is brought for todd as he moves into the boldest part of this plan
he carefully turns to
will beadle bamford be the judge
lovetts eyes shoot to todd alarmed the beadle moves toward todd
todd smiles amiably but quivers internally at being so dreadfully close to his prey
lovett watches concerned
will the beadle recognize the features of benjamin barker
the beadle stops right before todd and smiles
glad as always to oblige my friends and neighbors to the crowd let the challenge commence
one man sits in todds plain chair as the other moves to an elaborate chair on pirellis caravan
pirelli shakes out a fancy bib with a flourish and covers his man
toby prepares pirellis ornate shaving supplies as todd takes a plain towel and tucks it around his mans neck
the fastest smoothest shave is the winner
he blows his shrill whistle
agitated music begins
pirelli strops his razor quickly todd in a leisurely manner
pirelli keeps glancing at todd in various paranoid ways throughout frightened of todds progress
he starts whipping up lather rapidly while mixing furiously now signorini signori we mix a da lather but first a you gather around signorini signori you looking a man who
have had a da glory to shave a da pope
sweeney so smart splatters the customer with shaving cream oh i beg a you pardon ll call me a lie was a only a cardinal nope
it was a da pope
unexpectedly todd still shows no signs of starting to shave his man
he merely watches pirellis performance
lovett looks at him nervously wishing he would get on with it
pirelli now feeling he can take his time sings lyrically as he lathers and shaves with rhythmic scrapes and elaborate gestures of wiping the razor
to shave a da face to cut a da hair require da grace require da flair for if a you slip you nick da skin you clip a da chin
you rip a da lip a bit beyond a repair
todd strops his razor slowly and deliberately shoop shoop shoop disconcerting pirelli and drawing the crowds attention
to shave a da face or even a part widout it a smart require da heart
not just a da flash it take a panache it take a da passion for da art
todd is unconcerned
he just continues to slowly strop his razor shoop shoop shoop which flusters pirelli
to shave a da face to trim a da beard to make a da bristle clean like a whistle dis is from early infancy da talent give to me by
crosses himself with his razor it take a da skill it take a da brains it take a da will to take a da pains it take a da pace
it take a da graaaaaace
while pirelli holds this note elaborately todd with a few deft strokes quickly lathers his mans face shaves him and signals the beadle to examine him
blowing whistle the winner is todd
feeling the customers cheek smooth as a babys arse
to todd well done dear
the crowd laughs and applauds todd as pirelli goes to him a profound bow sir i bow to a skill far defter than my own
the five pounds
pirelli produces a distinctive chatelaine purse and removes a five pound note gives it to todd here sir
and may the good lord smile on you a quick stab of a smile until we meet again
he bows his head quickly and then moves away beckoning to toby come boy
were pulling out sir
without warning pirelli slaps toby viciously across the face toby almost falls snarling were pulling out yes
lovett has observed all of this as she moves away with todd who is making his way inexorably toward the beadle
some eager customers surround todd among them is the mr
todd sir do you have an establishment of your own
lovett is on him like a hawk he certainly does
sweeney todds tonsorial parlor above my meatpie emporium in fleet street
todd has led them right to the beadle i thank you for your honest adjudication sir
you are a paragon of integrity
well i try to do my best for my friends and neighbors
your establishment is in fleet street you say
todd you will surely see me there before the week is out
you will be welcome beadle bamford and i guarantee to give you without a pennys charge the closest shave you will ever know
todd and mrs
lovett are walking away from the marketplace
she chatters happily like to give me a coronary right there
what if he had recognized you
lord my heart was beating a mile a minute just like a little finch it was
arent those lovely birds now
always so twittery and happy
she continues chattering
but todd is not listening
his eyes dart to the side to see the gentleman is walking next to him whispering subtle insinuating
sweeney pondered and sweeney planned
like a perfect machine e planned
the banker moves in next to the gentleman
barbing the hook baiting the trap setting it out for the beadle to snap
the general joins them
slyly courted im sweeney did set a sort of a scene e did
laying the trail showing the traces letting it lead to higher places
the last word echoes
and then they are gone
disappearing from todds mind
swallowed up by the crowd of pedestrians
todd looks to mrs
lovett and she continues chattering suppose its just me gentle heart but i do hate to see a boy treated like that no better than your aunt doreens dog mr
todd are you listening to me
but then his eyes dart again looking for the specters
he only sees strangers
johanna sits framed by the window quietly cutting out silhouettes
aimless victorian handicrafts
but we see there are tears in her eyes
she steals a glance across the room
we see a small hole in the wallpaper
through this hole the judge is watching her from another chamber
johanna finally stands and casually glances out from between the shutters at her window
anthony standing at the park across the street keeping up his lonely vigil gazing up at the mansion
she watches him for a moment and then makes her decision
she moves to a table and opens a drawer
reaches in and removes something
anthony sees a figure at the shutters then hears a clinking sound
metal on pavement
he quickly moves across the street and looks
a key dropped from above
he looks up to the shutters and smiles then snatches up the key and hurries off
peering through the shutters johanna watches him go
we linger on her face and then dissolve to another face also watching
todds face staring out the window intense and brooding
seething with discontent
lovett chatters as she moves around behind him its not much of a chair ill grant but itll serve
was me poor alberts chair
sat in it all day long he did after his leg give out from the gout poor dear
he moves from the window and paces like a caged tiger in the small barber shop
though it has been cleaned it is still a spartan room
a tatty parlor chair
a large chest
a few counters with meager bottles of tonsorial supplies
and his gleaming razors always waiting
why doesnt the beadle come
before the week is out thats what he said
and who says the weeks out
its only tuesday
todd moves away from her she pursues trying to calm and soothe him
hush love hush
dont distress yourself whats your rush
keep your thoughts nice and lush
he continues to pace hush love hush
think it through
once it bubbles then whats to do
watch it close
let it brew
he does not respond
she dares to move closer
ive been thinking flowers maybe daisies to brighten up the room
dont you think some flowers pretty daisies might relieve the gloom
ah wait love wait
todd sourly tosses himself into the chair he picks up his largest razor and looks at it intensely to razor and the judge
when will we get to him
cant you think of nothing else
always broodin away on yer wrongs what happened heaven knows how many years ago
dont you know silly man half the fun is to plan the plan
all good things come to those who can wait
her gentle words have calmed him considerably
she moves even closer
risks touching him softly
gillyflowers maybe stead of daisies
i dont know though
what do you think
then todd tilts the razor in his hand suddenly the face of the gentleman a flash reflected in the razor then a bell rings from outside the shop the effect
is electric todd bolts up senses alert mrs
lovett spins to the door todd holds his razor open as he moves strategically toward the door we hear footsteps ascending the stairs outside quickly then anthony enters breathless mr
thank god ive found you todd turns closing the razor as anthony sees mrs
lovett oh im sorry excuse me
a pleasure maam continues to todd you see theres a girl who needs my help such a sad girl and lonely but beautiful too and slow down anthony
takes a breath yes im sorry
this girl has a guardian so tyrannical that he keeps her locked away
but then this morning she dropped this
produces the key it must be a sign that johanna wants me to help her thats her name johanna and turpin that of her guardian
a judge of some sort
todd and mrs
lovett exchange a quick glance as anthony continues ive met him mr
todd and he is unnatural
once he goes to court im going to slip into the house and release her and beg her to come away with me
oh this is all terribly romantic
yes but you see i dont know anyone in london to todd and i need somewhere safe to bring her till ive hired a coach to take us to plymouth
he looks at todd deeply if i could keep her here just for an hour or two i would forever be in your debt
todd stares at him his mind racing to figure out how this new twist might aid in his plans
it is mrs
lovett who smoothly replies bring her here dear
thank you maam
to todd mr
the girl may come
taking his hand thank you my friend
seems like the fates are favoring you at last mr
todd grunts unhappy what is it love
youll have her back before the day is out
for a few hours
before he carries her off to the other end of england
let him bring her here and then since youre so hot for a little makes a throat cutting gesture thats the throat to slit dear
todd moves again to his post at the window he stares out deep in thought
meanwhile she happily moves around the shop straightening things up and trying to make it all a bit more cozy poor little johanna
all those years without a scrap of motherly affection
well well soon see to that
alert sees something whats this
lovett joins him at the window
below they see pirelli approaching with toby in tow
look at that face hes up to mischief
go keep the boy below with you
she nods and scurries out
we go with her
lovett quickly moves down the steps outside the barber shop to greet pirelli and toby as they are about to ascend
we see a new sign on the stairs sweeney todds tonsorial parlor
signora is mr
todd at home
plying his trade upstairs dontcher know
she stands on the staircase blocking their way looking at toby mrs
lovett contd would you look at it now
dont look like its had a kind word since half past never
to pirelli you wouldnt mind if i gave him a nice juicy meat pie would yer
impatient yes yes whatever you like
pirelli climbs the stairs as she takes toby by the hand and leads him toward the pie shop door come with me now
your teeth is strong i hope
they go into the pie shop
todd is standing arms folded
reverting to his natural irish call me danny
daniel higgins the name when its not professional
id like me five quid back ifn ya dont mind
because you entered into our little wager on false pretenses me friend and so you might remember to be more forthright in the future youll be handing over half your
profits to me share and share alike
todd shakes his head amused and begins to turn away when pirelli says mr
lovett hands toby one of her grisly pies he devours eagerly
thats my boy tuck in
but her attention is almost entirely on the roof above
the muffled voices
the sound of shoes walking
her eyes keep darting up as she chatters distractedly with toby like to see a man with a healthy appetite
reminds me of my dear albert like to gorge himself to bloatation he did
he didnt have your nice full head though to tell the truth he pulls off the wig which covers his own short cropped hair it gets awful hot
pirelli is expansively strolling around the shop taking it all in savoring every second yes this will do very nicely
you dont remember me
well why should you
i was just a down and out irish pug you hired for a couple of weeks sweeping up hair and the like he picks up one of todds razors but
i remember these and how could i ever forget you benjamin barker
pirelli contd i would sit right there and watch you and dream of the day i could be a proper barber meself
you might say you were an inspiration to me
todd glares at him
so do we have a deal or should i run down the street for me pal beadle bamford
what do you say to that now mr
without a word of warning like a thunderbolt todd is on him
he leaps across the shop and brutally grabs pirelli by the neck violently strangling him pirelli is surprisingly strong and puts up a desperate struggle they thump awkwardly around the
lovett hears the muffled sounds of the struggle above
she nervously begins to shift and clang some things around as she cleans the counter trying to cover the sound chattering my my my always work to be done
spic and span thats my motto
cleanliness is next to whatever it is
so ah how did you end up with that dreadful eyetalian
still eating happily got me from the workhouse e did
been there since i was born
got no mum got nobody
a wasted soul thats what i am a sudden urgent thought oh god
hes got an appointment with his tailor he bolts up clearly terrified of pirelli if hes late hell blame me
but he is gone toby vaults up the stairs to the barber shop todd is standing calmly when toby bursts in signor you got an appointment
he stops when he realizes pirelli is nowhere to be seen
signor pirelli has been called away
you better run after him
oh no sir
i better wait for him here or itll be a lashing
hes a great one for the lashings
he moves past todd to the large chest and sits only now do we see one of pirellis hands protruding from the chest dangling limply
toby doesnt notice it
todd at this moment however does
he smiles nervously
so hmmm mrs
lovett gave you a pie did she
shes a real lady
model of all true christian virtue
then pirellis hand
toby doesnt notice
todd does stares at it anxiously
that she is
that she is
but if i know a growing boy theres still room for some more pie eh
id say sir pats his stomach an aching void
pirellis hand begins to twitch more desperately now perilously close to where tobys hand rests
then why dont you run downstairs and wait for your master there
therell be another pie in it for you im sure
pirellis hand is twitching closer to tobys now
no i should stay here
a sudden inspiration i know why dont you tell mrs
lovett i said to give you a nice big tot of gin
leaps up gin sir
thanking you kindly sir
youre a christian indeed
he races out happily and clatters down the stairs
a beat as todd gets his breath
then he goes to the trunk leans down to open it the camera follows him down and up again when he rises the gentleman is standing right behind him
the gentlemans face is completely impassive
he is not spectral
he does not disappear
he just stands there
todd looks at him
then the gentlemans eyes slowly move to a counter
todd follows his look to see
his largest razor
a long beat as todd looks at the razor
the point of no return
todd strides to the razor and he snaps it open with a sharp quick flick of his wrist then he moves to the chest and with great ferocity he hauls
pirelli up pirellis eyes snap open and todd slashes his throat the piercing factory whistle screams todd remains standing over pirelli as the painful whistle echoes into music
we see that the gentleman is still standing there watching todd
his hands were quick his fingers strong
it stung a little but not for long
the dashing oxford student is now leaning against a wall arms folded looking at todd
and those who thought him a simple clod were soon reconsidering under the sod
the tourist stands by the window
consigned there with a friendly prod from sweeney todd the demon barber of fleet street
see your razor gleam sweeney feel how well it fits as it floats across the throats of hypocrites
the last word echoes to silence as we cut to a high angle shot of the room
the ghosts are gone
todd stands alone over pirellis body
blood dripping from his razor
judge turpin lurks over the proceedings
he sits the personification of power very high at the bench
he glares down a wasted wretch of a boy
the beadle stands next to the boy
this is the second time sir that you have been brought before this bench
though it is my earnest wish to ever temper justice with mercy your persistent dedication to a life of crime is an abomination before god and man
he places a black cloth on his head i therefore sentence you to hang by the neck until you are dead and may the lord have mercy on your soul
the wretched boy collapses in sobs
the beadle is pleased with the verdict
the judge removes the black cloth and tosses it casually on his desk this court is adjourned
the judge and the beadle walk away from the impressive edifices of the old bailey
thank you your honor
just the sentence we wanted
was he guilty
well if he didnt do it hes surely done something to warrant a hanging
quietly what man has not
no matter come walk home with me
i have news for you my friend
in order to shield her from the evils of this world i have decided to marry my dear johanna
ah sir happy news indeed
strange though when i offered myself to her she showed a certain
the beadle proceeds with exquisite and obsequious delicacy excuse me my lord may i request my lord permission my lord to speak
forgive me if i suggest my lord youre looking less than your best my lord theres powder upon your vest my lord
and stubble upon your cheek and ladies my lord are weak
as they round a corner the judge feels his chin stubble you say
perhaps at times i am a little overhasty with my morning ablutions
cheerily fret not though my lord i know a place my lord a barber my lord of skill
thus armed with a shaven face my lord some eau de cologne to brace my lord and musk to enhance the chase my lord youll dazzle the girl until she
bows to your every will
a barber eh
take me to him
i am honored my lord
his name is todd
and he is the very last word in barberin
they head off
lovett is pouring toby a glass of gin not his first
he gulps down the gin between ravenous bites of another meat pie as she nervously glances up to the ceiling wondering what the hell is going on up there
you ought to slow down a bit lad
itll go to your head
weaned on the stuff i was
they used to give it to us at the workhouse sos we could sleep
not that youd ever want to sleep in that place maam
not with the things wot happen in the dark
thats nice dear
i think ill just pop in on mr
todd for a tick
youll be all right here
leave the bottle
todd is methodically cleaning his razor
gawd the lad is drinking me out of house and home how long until pirelli gets back
he wont be back
instantly suspicious mr
he casually points the razor toward the chest
she lifts the lid and sees pirellis body at the bottom of the chest
spinning on todd youre barking mad
killing a man wot done you no harm
he recognized me from the old days
he tried to blackmail me half my earnings
relieved oh well thats a different matter
for a moment there i thought youd lost your marbles
she looks into the chest again
all that blood
enough to make you come all over gooseflesh aint it
she starts to close the chest then has an idea
she reaches in and rummages around the body
pulls out pirellis chatelaine purse then drops the lid of the chest
looking through purse three quid
well waste not want not i always say
she tucks the purse into her dress now what are we going to do about the boy
send him up
she stops looks at him
oh we dont need to worry about him hes a simple thing
ill pawn him off with some story
cold send him up woman
quickly now mr
surely ones enough for today
dont want to indulge yourself after all
she busily starts to straighten up the room sides i was thinking about hiring a lad to help around the shop me poor knees not being what they used to
todd sighs and moves to his familiar post at the window anything you say
course well have to stock up on the gin the boy drinks like a barbary sailor todd suddenly gasps a great shocking intake of breath as his whole body tenses
like iron mrs
lovett spins to him the judge
lovett hurries to the window below they can see the judge and the beadle approaching
they see them exchanging a few words and then the beadle moves off as the judge approaches the shop todd whispers his eyes blazing justice
lovett gives him a quick kiss and then very quickly leaves
a beat as todd prepares himself
he turns from the window and looks around the shop shifting nervously
now that his great moment of revenge is at hand he doesnt quite know what to do with himself
he snatches up his large razor coils by the door ready to attack
he wants to savor this
he quickly moves and puts the razor down
finally he just stands
all his demons settling into a bizarre sort of calm
he hears the judges footsteps approaching on the stairs
then the judge enters
todd slowly turns at your service
an honor to receive your patronage my lord
you know me sir
a polite bow who in this wide world is not familiar with the honored judge turpin
the judge grunts and glances around the shop these premises are hardly prepossessing and yet the beadle tells me you are the most accomplished of all the barbers in the
that is gracious of him sir
indicates for the judge to sit sit if you please sir
the judge settles into the parlor chair as music begins
and what may i do for you today sir
a stylish trimming of the hair
a soothing skin massage
you see sir a man infatuate with love her ardent and eager slave
so fetch the pomade and pumice stone and lend me a more seductive tone a sprinkling perhaps of french cologne but first sir i think a shave
the closest i ever gave
he whips a sheet over the judge then tucks the bib in
the judge hums flicking imaginary dust off the sheet todd whistles gaily
youre in a merry mood today mr
mixing lather tis your delight sir catching fire from one man to the next
tis true sir love can still inspire the blood to pound the heart leap higher
what more what more can man require than love sir
more than love sir
ah yes women
the judge hums jauntily todd whistles and starts stropping his razor rhythmically
he then lathers the judges face
still whistling todd stands back to survey the judge who is now totally relaxed eyes closed
todd goes to his razor and picks it up sings to it gently now then my friend
now to your purpose
patience enjoy it
revenge cant be taken in haste
opening his eyes make haste and if we wed youll be commended sir
goes to him and who may it be said is your intended sir
a shocked tremor through todd as the judge closes his eyes again and settles in comfortably
and pretty as a rosebud
the music rises
pretty as her mother
mildly puzzled what
what was that
oh nothing sir
may we proceed
the music builds as he steps behind the judge his razor ready we are sure the great moment has come the music still builds todd finally puts the razor at
the judges throat then with an easy flick of his wrist he just begins to shave the judge as pretty women
sipping coffee dancing
pretty women are a wonder
sitting in the window or standing on the stair something in them cheers the air
stay within you
blowing out their candles or combing out their hair
they sing simultaneously then they leave
even when they leave you and vanish they somehow can still remain there with you there with you
even when they leave they still are there
ah pretty women
at their mirrors
in their gardens
how they make a man sing
proof of heaven as youre living pretty women sir
the music approaches a feverish crescendo as todd prepares to finally kill the judge and they sing simultaneously pretty women yes
pretty women sir
pretty women sir
pretty women heres to pretty women all the pretty women just as the music reaches a climax todd raises his arm in a huge arc and is about to slash
the judges throat when suddenly anthony bursts in mr
ive seen johanna
she said shell leave with me tonight
the judge jumps up away from todd you
there is indeed a higher power to warn me thus in time he tears off the sheet as he advances savagely on anthony johanna elope with you
ill lock her up in some obscure retreat where neither you nor any other vile creature shall ever lay eyes on her again
he spins with venom to todd and as for you barber it is all too clear what company you keep
service them well and hold their custom for youll have none of mine
he strides out
todd stands frozen
todd you have to help me ive talked to johanna and
todd suddenly turns on him with a ferocious roar utterly stunned at his friends ferocity anthony backs away leaves the shop
music begins very agitated as todd stands motionless
his mind cracking apart
lovett hurries in all this shouting and running about whats happened
i had him and then the sailor busted in i know i saw them both running down the street and i said todd interrupts wildly i had him
his throat was bare beneath my hand
there there dear
dont fret spins on her violently no i had him
his throat was there and hell never come again
hush love hush
i keep telling you when
whats your rush
why did i wait
you told me to wait
now hell never come again
the music becomes ferocious as todds wrenching insanity always close to the surface finally explodes theres a hole in the world like a great black pit and its filled with
people who are filled with shit and the vermin of the world inhabit it but not for long
he suddenly looks to mrs
lovett she starts back alarmed by the pure madness in his eyes they all deserve to die
tell you why mrs
lovett tell you why because in all of the whole human race mrs
lovett there are two kinds of men and only two
theres the one staying put in his proper place and the one with his foot in the other ones face look at me mrs
lovett look at you he suddenly lurches and grabs mrs
lovett tightly no we all deserve to die
even you mrs
lovett even i
because the lives of the wicked should be slashes at the air violently made brief
for the rest of us death will be a relief we all deserve to die
he clutches her to him very tightly as he suddenly keens a howl of pure agony and ill never see johanna no ill never hug my girl to me he
lovett away from him finished
we suddenly slash to in todds mind
we are moving with him as he stalks relentlessly holding his razor striding down a busy street like a tiger
the many pedestrians he passes dont even notice him
he is invisible to them a wolf among the sheep as he beckons all right
you sir how about a shave
come and visit your good friend sweeney
todd continues to stride beckoning to another man you sir too sir welcome to the grave
i will have vengeance i will have salvation
todd continues to stride beckoning to another man who sir
no ones in the chair come on come on sweeneys waiting
i want you bleeders
todd continues to stride beckoning to another man you sir anybody
gentlemen now dont be shy
not one man no nor ten men nor a hundred can assuage me i will have you
todd continues to prowl
and i will get him back even as he gloats
in the meantime ill practice on less honorable throats todd suddenly falls to his knees keening in anguish and my lucy lies in ashes and ill never see my girl
again but the work waits im alive at last a final exalted cry and im full of jooooooy
he raises his razor high on the soaring last note as we pull back
our view is suddenly obscured by a strange frenzied fluttering of black wings
we continue to pull back
we discover the black wings are pigeons thousands of them flying up in a great cloud
we continue to pull back to finally discover that todd is kneeling in the heart of a church square
empty but for him
as his cry ends we slash back to todd is kneeling sweat pouring through his clothes panting for air
lovett stands looking down at him intently
thats all very well but what are we going to do about kicks the chest the dear departed
todd remains kneeling motionless
she goes to him firm listen
do you hear me
get a hold of yourself
she slaps his cheek he looks up at her barely seeing her
oh you great useless thing come on she hauls him up and drags him out
she pulls him in
he thumps down still in his own dark world
she quickly glances around for toby and then goes into her parlor
she discovers toby is asleep on the sofa before the fire
she quickly snatches up a bottle of gin from the sideboard and returns to the pie shop
she pours todd a tumbler of gin hands it to him there drink it down all the way thats right
he does so now we got a body molderin away upstairs what do you intend we should do about that
later on when its dark well take him to some secret place and bury him
well yes of course we could do that
i dont suppose hes got any relatives going to come poking around looking for him
a chord of music
he looks at her uncomprehendingly
well you know me sometimes bright ideas just pop right into my head and i keep thinking
seems a downright shame
seems an awful waste
such a nice plump frame wots his name has
nor it cant be traced
business needs a lift debts to be erased think of it as thrift as a gift
if you get my drift
todd has no idea what she is talking about no
she sighs seems an awful waste
i mean with the price of meat what it is when you get it if you get it todd suddenly understands ah
good you got it
she warms to the idea take for instance mrs
mooney and her pie shop
business never better using only pussycats and toast
and a pussys good for maybe six or seven at the most
and im sure they cant compare as far as taste mrs
lovett what a charming notion the music builds as they sing simultaneously eminently practical and yet appropriate as always
lovett how ive lived without you all these years ill never know
well it does seem a waste
its an idea
think about it
lots of other gentlemenll soon be coming for a shave wont they
think of all them pies
a triumphant waltz theme begins for whats the sound of the world out there
todd what mr
todd what is that sound
those crunching noises pervading the air
todd yes mr
todd yes all around its man devouring man my dear they sing simultaneously and who are we to deny it in here
then who are we to deny it in here
music continues under ah these are desperate times mrs
lovett and desperate measures are called for
she goes to the counter and comes back with an imaginary pie here we are now hot out of the oven
she holds the imaginary pie out to him with a sly and wicked smile
what is that
have a little priest
is it really good
sir its too good at least
then again they dont commit sins of the flesh so its pretty fresh
looking at it awful lot of fat
only where it sat
havent you got poet or something like that
no you see the trouble with poet is how do you know its deceased
try the priest
tasting it mmm
not as hearty as bishop perhaps but not as bland as curate either
lovett presents another imaginary pie lawyers rather nice
if its for a price
order something else though to follow since no one should swallow it twice
anything thats lean
well then if youre british and loyal you might enjoy royal marine
anyway its clean
though of course it tastes of wherever its been
looking past her to imaginary oven is that squire on the fire
mercy no sir look closer youll notice its grocer
more like vicar
no it has to be grocer its green
todd laughs as the glorious waltz theme returns the history of the world my love save a lot of graves do a lot of relatives favors
is those below serving those up above
everybody shaves so there should be plenty of flavors
how gratifying for once to know indicating barber shop above that those above will serve those down below
the music continues under since marine doesnt appeal to you how about rear admiral
i prefer general
with or without his privates
with is extra
todd chortles as mrs
lovett offers another pie with a particular flamboyant panache what is that
finest in the shop
or we have some shepherds pie peppered with actual shepherd on top
and ive just begun
heres a politician so oily its served with a doily have one
put it on a bun
she looks at him quizzically well you never know if its going to run
try the friar
fried its drier
no the clergy is really too coarse and too mealy
then actor thats compacter
yes and always arrives overdone
he is suddenly dark and purposeful ill come again when you have judge on the menu
the music vamps deliciously as true we dont have judge yet but would you settle for the next best thing
she offers him a butchers cleaver executioner
he takes the cleaver feels the heft of it
then he picks up her wooden rolling pin hands it to her as the music builds into the triumphant waltz have charity towards the world my pet yes yes i
know my love well take the customers that we can get
high born and low my love
well not discriminate great from small
no well serve anyone well serve anyone and to anyone at all
the music builds to a climax as they joyously brandish their weapons
small white hands
removing some clothes from a drawer putting them into a portmanteau
locking the case
johanna wearing traveling clothes is packing to leave when a voice surprises her so its true
the judge stands in the doorway
a gentlemen knocks before entering a ladys room
indeed he does
but i see no lady
he enters dangerously quiet
and terrifically hurt
i told myself the sailor was lying
i told myself this was a cruel fiction that my johanna would never betray me
never hurt me so
he moves toward her
she stands her ground
i will leave this place
i think that only appropriate
since you no longer find my company to your liking madam we shall provide you with new lodgings
he stands very close to her
still she holds her ground
until this moment i have spared the rod
and the ungrateful child has broken my heart
now you will learn discipline
the large form of the beadle fills the doorway
she glances to him disquieted
when you have learned to appreciate what you have perhaps we shall meet again
think on your sins
he nods to the beadle the beadle surges forward and grabs johanna brutally she screams and fights like a tiger to no avail the beadle covers her mouth with one
of his huge hands and hauls her out anthony is racing toward the front of mansion when he sees a hansom cab is just pulling away johannas terrified face looking at him through the window anthony sees the beadle pulling her away from the window as the carriage clatters off judge turpin stands on the steps of the mansion anthony goes to him in a murderous rage where are you taking her
tell me or i swear by god
the judge spins and roars a hellish howl that echoes anthonys eyes burn into the judge but he is no killer
he turns and races after the hansom cab
it rounds a corner and is gone
the judge watches as anthony pursues the cab disappearing around the corner
and we fade to
the face of the beggar woman
she sits crouched on her haunches peering up from under her few greasy locks of hair
she is watching something intently
a few pedestrians move quickly down the sidewalk past her excited
they chatter back and forth eagerly
the beggar woman uncoils and follows
and we finally see what the beggar woman has been watching so intently
lovetts wretched establishment has been transformed
she has created a modest outdoor eating garden with tables surrounded by glowing chinese lanterns
a fresh coat of paint a few bushes in pots and birds in cages add to the feeling of upward mobility
a new sign hangs proudly over the entrance to the pie shop mrs
lovetts world famous meat pies
and then in smaller letters like mother used to make
the eating garden is already crowded the benches at the tables are filled and other customers stand and mill about
all eating eating eating
the most delicious looking meat pies you could ever imagine
thick luxurious gravy
tart and tangy meat
the customers take great hungry mouthfuls the steaming gravy oozing down greedy faces
the beggar women stands across the street ravenously hungry
she finally gets the nerve to approach when toby wearing a spiffy new outfit with apron bursts from the shop and circulates through the customers ladies and gentlemen may i
have your attention perlease
are your nostrils aquiver and tingling as well at that delicate luscious ambrosial smell
yes they are i can tell
he moves through the greedily eating customers in the outdoor garden and toward the street as well ladies and gentlemen that aroma enriching the breeze is like nothing compared to
its succulent source as the gourmets among you will tell you of course
he arrives at the street and drums up some more business ladies and gentlemen you cant imagine the rapture in store indicating the pie shop just inside of this door
there youll sample mrs
lovetts meat pies savory and sweet pies as youll see
you who eat pies mrs
lovetts meat pies conjure up the treat pies used to be
just then mrs
lovett sweeps from the pie shop with a tray of hot steaming pies
like her shop she has been transformed as well
she wears her somewhat gauche notion of a fancy dress
buckets of decolletage
and her hair has been dyed a rather unique aubergine color
pushing past a customer scuse me
indicating a beckoning customer ale there
the customers suddenly exclaim their joy through awkward mouthfuls of pie god thats good
toby scurries inside to get a jug of ale whisks back out and starts filling tankards as mrs
lovett circulates grandly
she is a bundle of activity serving pies collecting money giving orders addressing the patrons individually and with equal buoyant insincerity nice to see you dearie
how have you been keeping
cor me bones is weary
indicating a customer one for the gentleman

to a woman frankly dear forgive my candor family secret all to do with herbs
things like being careful with your coriander thats what makes the gravy grander
the customers are getting more rabid now stuffing in the gorgeous meat pies in great fistfuls more hot pies
music continues as todd makes the final adjustments to his chair
he stands back
seems delighted with the results of his tinkering
the ratty old parlor chair has been transformed into a sleek victorian barber chair with unique refinements
he leaves the barber shop
todd stands at the top of the stairs watching the street hungrily
as below mrs
lovett smiles to another customer incidentally dearie you know mrs
salesve been so dreary she spots the beggar woman again toby
continuing to the customer about mrs

she sees the man going up to the barber shop
todd is still standing at the top of the stairs
he smiles secretly to mrs
lovett as he ushers the man in
the man goes into the barber shop as she happily takes down the sold out sign and turns again to the customers how about it dearie
expecting more pies be here in a twinkling

lovett then spots the beggar woman approaching again she spins to toby with truly shocking viciousness toby
throw the old woman out
lovett watches intently as toby leads the beggar woman away
the customers meanwhile are building to a pure frenzy of mastication chewing and gulping and snapping at the heavenly pies god thats good that is de have you licious ever
tasted smell such oh my god what perfect more thats pies such flavor god thats good
the music comes to a rousing conclusion as mrs
lovett stands at the door to her shop
todd is alone
he sits in the barber chair smoking a pipe
he is holding an old daguerreotype creased stained and bleached out
the image shows his wife lucy smiling and holding baby johanna
the childs features are almost completely obscured by a stain on the picture
he looks at it deeply
then church bells echo in the distance
the church bells continue as we discover anthony searching through the streets for johanna
we see him in long shot as he moves through the contours of the city
he starts his search in a luxurious area of wealth
his journey through the city will take him lower and lower into the darkest corners of london
i feel you johanna i feel you
do they think that walls can hide you
even now im at your window
i am in the dark beside you buried sweetly in your yellow hair johanna
he continues walking
todd gazes quietly at the daguerreotype johanna
and are you beautiful and pale with yellow hair like her
id want you beautiful and pale the way ive dreamed you were
we see the figure of anthony walking along the docks
todd shaves a customer
we recognize the customer instantly it is the gentleman
the daguerreotype now rest on the counter
todd remains wistful detached dream like
and if youre beautiful what then with yellow hair like wheat
i think we shall not meet again he quietly slits the gentlemans throat my little dove my sweet
we see the figure of anthony walking past hanging carcasses of the busy meat market
ill steal you johanna
the dead gentleman is slumped in the chair
goodbye johanna youre gone and yet youre mine
im fine johanna im fine
he pulls a lever on the newly adjusted chair the chair becomes a slide and the gentleman disappears through a trapdoor in the floor down a chute todd pulls the
lever again and the chair returns to its normal position
we see anthony moving past a crowded tenement redolent of cholera
music continues as mrs
lovett descends a long and very claustrophobic series of steps down to the bakehouse
she unbolts and pulls aside a heavy iron door and enters
we remain outside
a fiery red glow spills out the roar of the oven within is thundering
the beggar woman stands on fleet street
the hellish metropolis glows the smoke from a thousand chimneys creating a great pall over the city
in a demented rage smoke
sign of the devil
sign of the devil
city on fire
to disgusted passers by witch
smell it sir
an evil smell
every night at the vespers bell smoke that comes from the mouth of hell city on fire
city on fire
she begins to scuttle off mischief
the red glow of sunset fills the shop as todd ushers in another customer and prepares to shave him and if i never hear your voice my turtledove my dear
i still have reason to rejoice the way ahead is clear
we see the figure of anthony moving down a dark alley
shadowy figures lurk along the alley walls
i feel you
todd continues to prepare to shave the customer and in that darkness when im blind with what i cant forget its always morning in my mind my little lamb my
we see anthony moving past an lonely graveyard
you stay johanna
he quietly cuts the customers throat the way ive dreamed you are
todd notices dusk outside the window oh look johanna pulls the lever and the customer disappears a star
tossing the customers hat down the chute a shooting star
anthony continues to move past the graveyard
buried sweetly in your yellow hair
music continues as mrs
lovett emerges from the bakehouse with a rack of hot pies
she walks out of frame up the steps as we push in on the crack in the door
the fiery roar of the oven within is overpowering
the beggar woman is scuttling madly along fleet street
pointing to the smoke over rooftops there
somebody somebody look up there
the passers by continue to ignore her didnt i tell you
smell that air
city on fire
she approaches the pie shop the agitated music matching her increasing frenzy
she grabs a stunned toby who is carrying some packages toward the pie shop panicked quick sir
run and tell
warn em all of the witchs spell
there it is there it is the unholy smell
tell it to the beadle and the police as well
she spots mrs
lovett emerging from the pie shop and explodes in desperation pointing madly help
city on fire
toby pulls away from her as she begins to scuttle off city on fire
she appeals to other pedestrians as she goes alms
toby turns to consider the horrible black smoke belching from the chimney of the pie shop
something about the foul ebony smoke troubles him
todd is standing alone contemplative slowly and methodically stropping his razor
and though ill think of you i guess until the day i die i think i miss you less and less as every day goes by
we see the figure of anthony trudging past the sinister opium dens and depraved taverns of the east end
todd completes shaving a customer
the customers wife and daughter are waiting
and youd be beautiful and pale and look too much like her
if only angels could prevail wed be the way we were
the customer pays
with a pleasant smile todd ushers them out
anthony wanders past the high and impenetrable walls of a madhouse the demented souls within can be seen moving about in silhouette behind barred windows
i feel you
something makes him stop
he turns to consider the asylum
todd shaves another customer
a beautiful morning outside the window
wake up johanna
another bright red day
he slits the customers throat we learn johanna to say
as the note continues he pulls the lever and the customer disappears down the chute
anthony stares up at the asylum
ill steal you
as the music concludes todd picks up the faded daguerreotype and again sits in his barber chair
he gazes at the picture lost in revery
lovett and todd rest on a picnic blanket just like any other couple out enjoying the fine day
the remains of a nice picnic lunch are scattered around them and toby can be seen flying a kite a bit away
lovett watches happy couples moving about
dogs and kids running hither and yon
military officers squiring their ladies
nurses with prams
todd is distinctly ill at ease brooding as she chatters which is not to say we couldnt get some nice taxidermy animals to bring a touch of gentility to the
you know a boars head or two
glancing at the unresponsive todd mr
are you listening to me
then what did i just say
back in his somber reflections there must be a way to the judge
snaps the bloody old judge
always harping on the bloody old judge
she massages his neck we got a nice respectable business now money coming in regular and since were careful to pick and choose only strangers and such like wot wont
be missed whos going to catch on
no response from todd
she leans across and pecks him on the cheek oooh mr
todd kisses him again im so happy again i could again eat you up i really could
you know what id like to do mr
kisses him what i dream again if the business stays as good where id really like to go no response in a year or so
no response dont you want to know
couldnt care less of course
do you really want to know
forces a pained smile yes yes i do i do
the music continues as she leans back comfortably beginning to imagine a wonderful domestic future
ive always had this dream of living at the seaside
i got a picture postcard from me aunt nettie once
oh it seems like such a grand place
notes toby flying his kite and all that fresh aquatic airs bound to be good for the lads poxy lungs
by the sea mr
todd thats the life i covet by the sea mr
todd ooh i know youd love it
you and me mr
we could be alone in a house wot wed almost own down by the sea
grumbles anything you say
wouldnt that be smashing
and we go to
she and todd sit in the exact same positions as in hampstead heath
only now they are sitting on a beach
they are wearing what she imagines as fashionable seaside bathing clothes
toby who is not consumptively pale but overly rosy cheeked in her fantasy is building a sandcastle nearby
lovett is sitting with her dream todd of course so he has a bland smile on his face
in fact there is something vaguely unreal and stilted about all of this
with the sea at our gate well have kippered herring wot have swum to us straight from the straits of bering
every night in the kip when were through our kippers ill be there slippin off your slippers by the sea
with the fishies splashing
by the sea
wouldnt that be smashing
down by the sea anything you say anything you say
lovett strolls with todd on a boardwalk
artificially lovely couples like rotogravure magazine pictures move about
toby runs along ahead of them
i can see us waking the breakers breaking the seagulls squawking hoo
i do me baking then i go walking with yoo hoo
she waves to toby yoo hoo
lovett and todd recline on comfortable deck chairs having tea and scones
ill warm me bones on the esplanade have tea and scones with me gay young blade
lovetts notion of a fashionable little seaside cottage
crushing in its bourgeois blandness
she is making toby try on a sweater
todd is writing a letter
then ill knit a sweater while you write a letter
back on the beach she cuddles into todd coyly unless we got better to do hoo
anything you say
lovett and todd snuggle into bed think how snug itll be underneath our flannel when its just you and me and the english channel
lovett and todd entertain some unnaturally jolly chums
in our cozy retreat kept all neat and tidy well have chums over every friday
back on the beach
by the sea
anything you say
toby pulls mrs
lovett over to examine his little sandcastle as dont you love the weather by the sea
well grow old together by the seaside beckons to todd to join them hoo
by the beautiful sea
music continues as todd joins them
he kneels with toby to help him work on the sandcastle
lovett stands watching them the picture of the doting mother
itll be so quiet that wholl come by it except a seagull
we shouldnt try it though till its legal for two hoo
lovett and todd getting married
this being her fantasy after all she wears white
todd is in a constricting morning coat with a rakish top hat
toby the best man watches proudly
but a seaside wedding could be devised me rumpled bedding legitimized
they exchange vows and kiss
my eyelidsll flutter ill turn into butter the moment i mutter i do hoo
lovett is placing a plate of kippers on the table amidst a proper english breakfast
a guest stands leaning against a wall waiting to eat
by the sea in our nest we could share our kippers with the odd paying guest from the weekend trippers have a nice sunny suite for the guest to rest
in a dark shape quickly moves past the guest todd then the guest slides down the wall a splash of blood on the wallpaper now and then you could do the guest in back at the beach mrs
lovett todd and toby sit comfortably
watching an unnaturally gorgeous sunset
a picture postcard of a happy family
by the sea
married nice and proper by the sea bring along your chopper to the seaside hoo
by the beautiful sea
the music concludes as she throws her arms affectionately around her two men
we cut back to mrs
lovett is sitting in the exact same position with todd
her smiles fades as she considers him
the grim brooding reality is so clear next to her lovely dream
she watches him in silence as we fade to
todd is standing at his usual post the window gazing intently down at fleet street
lovett enters with a tray of food brought you some breakfast dear farm fresh eggs and a dollop of lovely clotted cream only the best for my
she stops when he realizes he isnt even listening to her
her heart sinks seeing him at the window wearing his obsession like a cloak
a beat as she looks at him
might i ask you a question
not turning mm
what did your lucy look like
he turns to her
you heard me
cant really remember can you
she had yellow hair
he turns back to the window
lovett proceeds with great sincerity youve got to leave all this behind you now
you keep looking down into the grave youre never gonna look up
and life will just pass right by
life is for the alive my dear
he does not answer
we could have a life we two
maybe not like i dreamed maybe not like you remember
but we could get by
he does not answer
come away from the window
a long beat
he finally turns from the window
almost as if to leave his demons behind
she smiles quietly and holds out her hand
she begins to cross to him
standing right behind mrs
lovett he is glaring at todd relentless and accusatory blood pouring from his throat a shocking horror movie vision then the bell rings outside the shop
the gentleman is gone
we hear footsteps climbing the stairs
lovett remains standing her hand out to him as anthony enters absolutely exhausted
sinks into a chair
seems ive not slept in a week but its done what is it anthony
bitter he has her locked in a madhouse
todds head snaps to anthony riveted youve found johanna
for all the good itll do its impossible to get to her
todd begins pacing the tiger again his mind is racing a madhouse
but ive circled the place a dozen times
theres no way in
its a fortress
anthony fades to a brooding silence as todd continues pacing thinking thinking
lovett watches him concerned
todd suddenly stops
we see him settling into an inspired sort of calm as if he can finally see the promised land
a whisper ive got him
to anthony weve got her
where do you suppose all the wigmakers of london go to obtain their human hair
they get their hair from the lunatics at bedlam i dont understand todd suddenly grabs anthony and hauls him up holds him close forehead to forehead his whispered intensity truly
disturbing we shall set you up as a wigmaker in search of hair that will gain you access then you will take her
you will not be deterred you will slaughter the world to bring her here
lovett watches troubled as todd embraces anthony closely
he holds him for a long beat
then todd is all action hurries to get some money and gives it to anthony as go and outfit yourself properly you are to be a gentlemen wigmaker
when you return we shall dispatch a letter to this mr
fogg announcing your arrival
go quickly now
clasping todds hand mr
todd how can i ever
anthony hurries out
todd immediately hurls himself into a chair and begins writing a letter his violent scrawl slashing across the page
dear i wonder if fetch the boy
dont you think its time you fetch the boy
lovett begins going down the stairs outside the barber shop
then she stops
she stands for a long moment disturbed that todds demons are again devouring him
she looks down and sees toby washing the tables in the outdoor garden
toby is serious about his work vigorously scrubbing the tables with soap and water
she watches him for a moment and then continues down the steps toby
todd requires you
he goes up the steps
she just stands deep in thought
todd is finishing the letter as toby enters mr
still writing you know where the old bailey is
oh yes sir
not that i ever interrupts folding up letter take this there and seek out a judge turpin
go to the old bailey
find judge turpin
handing him letter put this into his hands
only to him
do you understand
yes sir and while im out do you mind if i stop by the grocer and pick up the todd pounces like a panther he suddenly leaps up and grabs
toby by the throat with shocking brutality dont chatter boy
you are not to stop
you are not to speak
you are to deliver this letter
do you toby is stunned and terrified
it is the first time he has seen this side of his friend mr
todd releases him
toby races out
todd immediately begins pacing like a caged animal back and forth back and forth whispering to himself neurotically as day becomes evening
toby walks back to the pie shop upset
he stops when he sees todd at the window above unblinking gazing like a falcon into the street
he continues on to mrs
lovett who is clearing up the remains of a meal in the outdoor garden
where you been lad
we had quite the luncheon rush
me poor bones is ready to drop
she looks at him notes his dark expression
what is it toby
she sits next to him
todd sent me on an errand
and on the way back i went by the workhouse
and i was thinkin
but for you i would be there now
or someplace worse
seems like the good lord sent you for me
oh love i feel quite the same way hear me out mum

music continues what is this foolishness now

little things wot i been thinking
not to worry not to worry i may not be smart but i aint dumb
i can do it put me to it show me something i can overcome
not to worry mum
he leans into her she puts her arms around him but her expression is deeply troubled
being close and being clever aint like being true i dont need to i wont never hide a thing from you like some
music continues as she nervously comforts him now toby dear havent we had enough of this foolish chatter
lovett contd reaching for her purse here how about i give you a shiny new penny and you can fetch us some nice toffees
she pulls pirellis chatelaine purse from her dress thats signor pirellis purse
no no love this is just something mr
give me for my birthday see that proves it what i been thinkin he stands urgently pulling her hand we gotta go maam right now we gotta find the beadle
and get the law here she pulls him down to her again agitated her mind racing hush now toby hush
here you just sit next to me nice and quiet
calming how could you think such a thing of mr
todd whos been so good to us
he calms down a bit as she holds him
and she comes to a painful dreadful decision
nothings gonna harm you not while im around
nothings gonna harm you darling not while im around
he leans into her demonsll charm you with a smile for a while but in time nothings gonna harm you not while im around
the music continues as she holds him
there are tears in her eyes
but we see that her gentle song has calmed him
softly funny we should be having this little chat right now
cause i was just thinkin you know how youve always fancied coming into the bakehouse with me to help make the pies
dreamily yes maam
she quickly dries her eyes and then turns him to look at her
no time like the present
lovett leads toby down the claustrophobic long stairway toward the bakehouse
my heart bleeds for you havin to go up and down all these stairs
well thatll be your job now
she arrives at the heavy iron door to the bakehouse
we can hear the seismic rumble of the bake oven within
she unbolts the door and ushers toby in
and we finally enter
a macabre vision of hell
the roof hangs low in this subterranean chamber
the grisly tools of her trade are scattered about the place a large stained chopping block a meat grinder buckets of questionable viscous liquid cleavers and bone saws and meat
hooks wet sewer grates for the blood
a metal sheet hinged at the top has been attached to cover an opening in the wall the mouth of the chute from the barber shop above
and eeriest of all
the thundering roar of flame coming from a large industrial oven against one wall
toby takes in the cavernous bakehouse coo quite a stink aint there
she indicates the sewer grates those grates go right down to the sewers and the whiffs come up always a few rats gone home to jesus down there
so where do i start
she leads him across to the thrumming fiery oven now this would be the bake oven
ten dozen at a time
always be sure the doors is closed properly like this
trying to remember it all yesm always closed properly
she leads him to the meat grinder and heres the grinder
demonstrates it you pop in the meat give it a good grind and it comes out here
practicing with the grinder good grind comes out there
thats my boy
smoothly smoothly now ive got to pop upstairs back in two shakes all right
she begins to go
he stops her with do you think i might have a pie while i wait
he is standing at a rack of cooling pies
as many as you like son
as many as you like
she goes and shuts the door behind her
she leans against the bakehouse door tormented gasping for air
then she slowly bolts the door
a cacophony of madness
the ragged inmates of the asylum are slammed together in a series of cramped cells the low ceiling pressing down
we discover anthony dressed as a fashionable wigmaker walking past the cells with the odious mr
fogg carries a large pair of scissors
oh yes sir i agree it would be to our mutual interest to come to some arrangement in regard to my poor childrens hair
he moves to one of the cells and unlocks it i keep the blondes over here
it was yellow hair you was looking for sir
fogg goes into the crowded cell the inmates all blonde women scurry back clearly terrified of fogg
anthony sees johanna wearing a filthy straitjacket hunched like a feral animal cowering in a corner of the cell
points that one has hair the shade i need
fogg goes to fetch johanna hauls her to anthony come child
smile for the gentleman and you shall have a sweetie
johannas eyes shoot wide when she sees anthony but she says nothing
prepares scissors now where shall i cut
before fogg can react anthony pulls a revolver from his clothing grabs johanna and pushes fogg back into the cell
he swings the cell door shut locking fogg in
not a word mr
fogg or it will be your last
now i leave you to the mercy of your children
he grabs johanna and pulls her away
he is locked in with the blonde inmates
they slowly begin to advance on him
it is likely they are going to rip him limb from limb
todd and mrs
lovett are hurrying down the stairs from the barber shop urgent
todd has a razor
i got him locked in but if he escapes hell go to the law
then he cant escape
i dont know maybe we could the judge will be here soon
i have no time woman
they turn a corner and walk straight into the beadle
excuse me sir
you gave me a fright
not my intention good madam though i am here on official business
elaborately prepares a pinch of snuff you see theres been complaints
about the stink from your chimney
they say at night its something most foul
health regulations and the general public welfare naturally being my duty im afraid ill have to take a look
inhales the snuff sneezes and daintily wipes his nose at your bakehouse
smoothly of course
but first why dont you come upstairs and let me attend to you
much as i do appreciate tonsorial adornment i really ought see to my official obligations first
an admirable sentiment but i must ask you out of professional curiosity you understand is that a cream or a tallow pomade
touches his hair oh not a pomade at all
me secret is a touch of ambergris
but sir hair that delicate requires a genuine pomade
come along let me show you the difference
you are the expert in these matters
and well finish you off with a nice facial rub of bay rum
oooh bay rum is bracing
and all on the house for my friend beadle bamford
well sir i take that very kindly
bowing i am sir entirely at your his eyes flit to mrs
he leads the beadle away
lovett allows herself a breath
from across the street we see todd leading the beadle up the stairs to the barber shop chatting with him easily
we realize we are seeing the perspective of the beggar woman hunched across the street watching them closely
toby is eating a pie as he slowly wanders around the bakehouse
he stops to consider the many stained cleavers and bone saws curious
then he bites on something hard stops he reaches into his mouth and pulls something out
looks at it it is a fingernail
to be exact it is the severed tip of a finger
toby drops it in horror and starts back suddenly a loud thumping and clanging makes him spin alarmed as the bloody body of the beadle explodes suddenly from the mouth
of the chute toby screams and races to the door pulls at it
he bangs on the heavy iron door wildly the thundering roar from the bake oven seems to rise to match his frenzy as in panic toby races to the sewer
grate yanks it up and disappears down into the sewers as the shrill factory whistle screams and we cut to todd stands by the chair his razor high his eyes blazing his face covered in a spray of blood lost in rapture
not for long
the gentleman the banker the general move into the frame with purpose impatient
the gentleman flicks out his handkerchief and begins to clean the blood off todds face he is not gentle the blood smears the engine roared the motor hissed and who
could see how the road would twist
meanwhile the banker pulls off todds stained barber tunic and hands todd his jacket in sweeneys ledger the entries matched a beadle arrived and a beadle dispatched
meanwhile the general is cleaning up the blood on the barber chair to satisfy the hungry god of sweeney todd
the demon barber of fleet
suddenly a sharp cry from across the room todd spins street
todd sees that more and more of the ghastly specters are moving around the room multiplying exponentially we see the tourist the student the priest and others
they are more intrusive than they have ever been touching todd eagerly preparing him for the finale of his drama variously sweeney
by now the ghosts are fully furies demented and threatening sweeney
the screeching music transforms into a strange symphony of inarticulate moans and howls and chants taking us to
todd and mrs
lovett are searching for toby through a horrible catacomb of decaying sewers
todd carries a razor
their voices echo bizarrely toby
where are you love
where are you lad
nothings gonna harm you
not while im around
nothings gonna harm you darling
nothing to be afraid of boy
not while im around
demons are prowling everywhere nowadays
music takes us to
anthony and johanna hurry into the barber shop
she is now dressed as a scruffy boy a cap hiding her hair
she is distracted and disturbed
you wait for him here ill return with the coach in less than half an hour
she gently touches todds collection of razors
dont worry darling in those clothes no one will recognize you
youre safe now
she picks up the largest razor looks at it an eerie echo of her father
darkly ironic safe
so we run away and then all our dreams come true
i hope so
i have never had dreams
when were free of this place all the ghosts will go away
she looks at him very intensely no anthony they never go away
he gently touches her face
ill be right back to you
half an hour and well be free
she turns to the window watches him go
her expression is sad he will never fully comprehend her depth
then she sees the beggar woman approaching from across the street
the beggar woman begins climbing the stairs to the barber shop beadle
no good hiding i saw you
are you in there still
johanna hears the beggar woman singing climbing the stairs
johanna looks around urgently sees the large chest
she quickly climbs into it and shuts the lid as the beggar woman enters
beadle dear beadle
the room has a strange effect on her as if she were vaguely recalling some distant dream
she intones to pretty lullaby music
beadle deedle deedle deedle deedle dumpling beadle dumpling be deedle dumpling
without warning like a thunderbolt todd leaps into the room what are you doing here
clutching at his arm ah evil is here sir
the stink of evil from below from her
calling beadle dear beadle
he looks anxiously out the window for the judge be quiet woman
still clutching at him shes the devils wife
oh beware her sir
she with no pity
slowing looking at him more closely in her heart
out of here
really peering at him now hey dont i know you mister
todd suddenly sees the judge
walking toward the shop todd has no time
the music thunders as in one brutal motion he swings around and grabs his razor fiercely slashes her throat tosses her in the chair pulls the lever she slides through
the floor he pulls the chair back to its normal position just as the judge enters
where is she
wheres the girl
below your honor
with my neighbor
thank heavens the sailor did not molest her
thank heavens too she has seen the error of her ways
oh yes sir your lesson was well learned
she speaks only of you longing for forgiveness
then she shall have it
shell be here soon you say
the music builds the pace increases i think i hear her now
excited oh excellent my friend
is that her dainty footstep on the stair
i hear nothing
yes isnt that her shadow on the wall
primping making herself even prettier than usual even prettier
blissful ohhhhhhh pretty women
pretty women yes
straightening his coat quickly sir a splash of bay rum
sit sir sit
settling into chair in lecherous rapture johanna johanna
todd gets a towel puts it carefully around the judge moves to get a bottle of bay rum pretty women
pretty women are a wonder
youre in a merry mood again today barber
joyfully pretty women
what we do for they sing simultaneously as todd smoothes bay rum on the judges face and then reaches for his razor pretty women
blowing out their candles combing out their hair then they leave even when they leave you and vanish they somehow can still remain there with you there
blowing out their candles or combing out their hair even when they leave they still are there theyre there
the music builds dangerously as how seldom it is one meets a fellow spirit
with fellow tastes in women at least
the years no doubt have changed me sir
todd contd but then i suppose the face of a barber the face of a prisoner in the dock is not particularly memorable
a horrified realization benjamin barker
the factory whistle screams a steady terrible blast as todd brutally slashes the judges throat severing his jugular the spray of blood drenches todd he pulls the lever and sends
the body tumbling out of sight down the chute
the music continues
as todd stands for a long moment blood dripping from his face exalted
then he sinks to his knees overcome
the music stops
a long beat of silence
then todd looks at his razor deeply rest now my friend rest now forever sleep now the untroubled sleep of the angels
then silence as he reverently sets the razor on the floor and looks at it
we focus on his face
his quest is completed
his demons silenced
the ghosts are gone
he just kneels there
no reason to move
no purpose in life
a sound from the chest
a slight thump
his eyes dart to the chest
he slowly picks up his razor and moves to the chest
then suddenly wrenches it open and hauls out johanna darkly come for a shave have you lad
he tosses her in the chair throws back his arm his razor ready surely yes
everyone needs a good shave
lovetts voice screaming to raise the dead todd rivets johanna pointing the razor at her a lethal warning forget my face
he spins and bolts out of the shop leaving her sitting in the chair mrs
lovett is standing in horror by the mouth of the chute
the judge still barely alive clutches at her skirt she tries to wrench herself away from his vise like grip die
god in heaven die
the judges fingers finally relax their grip he is dead
lovett backs away from him and for the first time notices the body of the beggar woman
can it be
have all the demons of hell come to torment me
she grabs the beggar woman and starts dragging her quickly toward the oven as todd races in why did you scream
does the judge live still
he was clutching holding on to my dress but hes finished now
she continues quickly dragging the beggar woman toward the oven
leave them to me
open the doors
he waves her toward the oven no
dont touch her
open the doors
he shoves her toward the oven and leans over to pick up the beggar womans body whats the matter with you
its only a silly old beggar then mrs
lovett opens the oven doors the thundering roar from the oven crashes through the room as the fiery light slashes across the floor clearly illuminating the face of the beggar
a chord of music as todd realizes who she is
music continues and builds as oh no
dont i know you
he looks up to mrs
lovett you knew she lived
from the moment that i came into your shop you knew my lucy lived
i was only thinking of you
looking down again lucy
a crazy hag picking bones and rotten spuds out of alley ashcans
would you have wanted to know she ended up like that
looking up you lied to me
desperately no no not lied at all
no i never lied
to beggar woman lucy
said she took the poison she did never said that she died poor thing she lived ive come home again
but it left her weak in the head all she did for months was just lie there in bed lucy
shouldve been in hospital wound up in bedlam instead poor thing
oh my god
better you should think she was dead
passionately yes i lied cos i love you
id be twice the wife she was
i love you
could that thing have cared for you like me
a harrowing keen todds eyes suddenly snap up to mrs
lovett as the glorious little priest waltz theme returns mrs
lovett youre a bloody wonder eminently practical and yet appropriate as always as youve said repeatedly theres little point in dwelling on the past
he steps toward her she steps back unsure as they sing simultaneously no come here my love
not a thing to fear my love
whats dead is dead
do you mean it
everything i did i swear i thought was only for the best believe me
a heartbreaking plea can we still be married
todd steps toward her darkly
she knows she is doomed
but steps into his arms anyway for a final triumphant waltz the history of the world my pet through tears oh mr
todd ooh mr
todd leave it to me
is learn forgiveness and try to forget
the lost dream by the sea mr
todd well be comfy cozy by the sea mr
todd where theres no one nosy
he waltzes her toward the roaring oven
she offers no resistance fully aware of whats coming
the blazing thundering inferno of the oven makes it seem they are the damned dancing through hell
and life is for the alive my dear so lets keep living it
just keep living it really living it
the music reaches a thundering crescendo as he flings her into the oven and slams the doors we hear her screaming
and banging on the oven doors
todd sinks to his knees and covers his ears desperately as the banging and screaming and music finally fade to silence
then he slowly drags himself across the floor to the beggar woman
he cradles her head in his arms
there was a barber and his wife and she was beautiful
a foolish barber and his wife she was his reason and his life
and she was beautiful
and she was virtuous
and he was
todd folds himself over his dead wife
the only sound his deep anguished sobs
a long beat
then he becomes aware of something
he looks over to see
toby staring at him from the open sewer grate
he has seen everything
todd watches as toby silently pulls himself up
todd gently sets lucy down and then still kneeling turns to face toby
a long beat as they look at each other
then toby slowly moves and carefully picks up todds razor
todd looks at him
then slowly unbuttons his collar and exposes his neck
he bends his head back offering his naked throat
toby slowly goes to him and methodically slits his throat
todd continues to gaze up at toby as we hear the lonely sound of wind escaping from his severed wind pipe
then toby turns and leaves the bakehouse
todd leans forward dying
we cut to his point of view the rough brick floor
from the bottom of the frame
a dark pool of blood slowly begins to spread
moving up the frame
the fiery glow from the bake oven reflected in the blood
finally the pool of blood fills the entire frame
we realize this is the first image we saw in the story
as he dies
as before the gentlemans face appears reflected in the pool of blood
attend the tale of sweeney todd his skin was pale and his eye was odd
the banker emerges from the shadows of the bakehouse
he shaved the faces of gentlemen who never thereafter were heard of again
the general emerges
and the tourist
and the priest and the student
variously he trod a path that few have trod did sweeney todd the demon barber of fleet street
then a new ghost
a face we recognize
the beggar woman
he kept a shop in london town of fancy clients and good renown
she is joined by the judge
and what if none of their souls were saved
they went to their maker impeccably shaved
by sweeney by sweeney todd the demon barber of fleet street
the beadle and pirelli join the ghosts
swing your razor wide sweeney
hold it to the skies
freely flows the blood of those who moralize
the ghosts move around the bakehouse considering the meat grinder and stained cleavers and chopping block
variously his needs are few his room is bare
he hardly uses his fancy chair
the more he bleeds the more he lives
he never forgets and he never forgives
perhaps today you gave a nod to sweeney todd
the demon barber of fleet street
hunting like predators we begin to move urgently through the ghosts
their long shadows tower bizarrely against the walls and ceiling of the bakehouse
the fiery red roar of the bake oven builds in intensity
variously sweeney wishes the world away sweeneys weeping for yesterday hugging the blade waiting the years hearing the music that nobody hears
sweeney waits in the parlor hall sweeney leans on the office wall
no one can help nothing can hide you isnt that sweeney there beside you
sweeney wishes the world away sweeneys weeping for yesterday is sweeney
there he is its sweeney
we tear through them with increasing frenzy cutting quickly vertiginous angles as the music builds variously there
almost a scream now there
they move away revealing todd and mrs
facing each other
we circle them attend the tale of sweeney todd
he served a dark and a hungry god
sharply to mrs
lovett to seek revenge may lead to hell
coldly to him but everyone does it if seldom as well as sweeney
as sweeney todd
the demon barber of fleet
the ghosts begin to disappear
fading into the shadows of the bakehouse
leaving todd and mrs
the febrile music continues as todd and mrs
lovett stand alone continuing to glare at each other
finally she gives him a grim little smile and disappears into the darkness
he stands alone
and we cut to a series of images from earlier in our story cut to the music todds life flashing before his eyes the images building as the music races
toward its conclusion todd singing slashing smiling striding the final crash of music at the final image todd kneeling hunched over the pool of blood on the bakehouse floor
into the blood
snap to black
