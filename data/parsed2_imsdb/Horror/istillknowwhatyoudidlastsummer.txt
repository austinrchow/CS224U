written by trey callaway the setting sun backlights a series of abstract colored images
holy images of stained glass and lead
footsteps echo across the marble floor
a little older a little wiser yet still very pretty no doubt
but shes all alone in the house of the lord
and those doleful eyes of hers clearly telegraph a very heavy burden still rests upon her soul
she reluctantly walks past the rows of empty pews toward a curtained julie slides the drapes shut behind her as she enters kneeling before the closed screen
a beat and the screen slides open
enters the adjacent booth barely visible through the wicker mesh
julie looks down crosses herself and begins
bless me father for i have sinned
a beat its been a year since my last confession
julie swallows hard
this is difficult for her
julie contd ive never told anyone this
not my mom not the poice not even my friends except for the ones who were there and they
well theyre not around anymore
you see i
i killed a man
well i thought i had
she balks at the memory of it
the priest bows his head in the shadows of the other side
julie contd emotional youve got to understand
it was all an accident
a terrible accident
its been a whole year
ive tried to get past this but i just cant
i have these dreams
and this man is always there with me
reassuring i know
you see he was a killer
he murdered helen and barry and he would have killed me too if i hadnt
gotten away with it
regathering i dont know i guess i just need to deal with the fear the guilt
to finally say his name
his name was ben willis
the confession is cathartic for julie
she looks relieved until i know
looks through the screen
a chill shoots through her body
but how could you
clouds of icy steam shoot through the partition
julie moves closer to the screen trying to get a better look
growls smashes through the screen right in julies face
still screaming julie jumps back seemingly knocked out of her chair
she fights the unseen demon
sitting beside her julies friend will benson reacts
hes a good looking kid in a shy humble kind of way
and he tries to help her but shes too busy turning ten shades of red
the professor lowers his glasses makes it even worse
nice to see you find political science so stimulating the lecture hall erupts with laughter
im sorry julie grabs her stuff and bolts
julie explodes out of the building
hurries down a sidewalk
will finally catches up
you dont seem fine
julie realizes this is true
i had another dream will
will takes this seriously
the shower again
it was in a church
it was so real
i mean i could feel his breath on me
caring im sorry
i thought i was over the dreams for good
i really did
i hadnt had one for months
it just takes time julie
its gonna get better
it cant get worse
i mean its not like this was the first time i freaked out in class
i hardly ever get a full nights sleep my grades suck im this close from being thrown out of school
julie jumps out of her skin
its just students letting off firecrackers as they fly past on bicycles
will and julie are now thinking the same thing
contd it was one year ago
thats whats going on
take it easy on yourself
weary im trying
i really am
sometimes i dont even know why i came up here in the first place
cheering her up to get out of southport
now i remember
he smiles at her
she smiles back
they stop in front of her apartment building
julie contd are you getting out of town on the fourth
ill probably just be here studying for finals
the joys of summer school
beat are you okay
are you sure
she touches his face affectionately
thanks for the talk will
youre good to me
will stands there akwardly um
will walks away
julie watches him a beat then turns down her walk steps out of the shadows
julie practically faints
oh my god ray
you scared me
recovering she hugs ray genuinely glad to see him
hes a bit cold
i got in early
i was excited
re the receding will who was that guy
oh thats will
hes a friend
youd like him
ray were just friend
every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good friend thing first
why are you being like this
it should be obvious ray feels insecure in the college environs but theyre miscommunicating
hey im sorry
are you ready to go
ive got the old truck
you know the drill
crab boil at ollies
croaker queen pageant
its only small town fun but its still nice
people really miss you
i miss you
she looks at ray his compassionate demeanor
this is hard to say softly but resolved ray i cant
i just feel like some part of me hasnt healed up enough to go back
like some critical piece is missing
ray is cold
this is what hes expected all along
i understand something
its not like that
its not you
i want to go back
i want to be with you
i want to be fine
i want everything to be like it used to be
beat it just isnt
ray is hurt and confused
julie contd hey why dont you stay up here
they have fireworks over the river
theres a million things to do
i have to work julie
my boats in southport remember
but i get it
you need your space from craokerland
and maybe from me too
ray starts walking away
ray contd you know where to find me
at least come up for a while
ray keeps on walking
im just gonna go
julie follows him out to the road
a group of laughing students block her way
ray im sorry
i didnt mean
to herself im just scared
but ray is already gone
julie stares after him a beat then turns quickly to her door
she clearly feels uncomfortable exposed on the walk alone
she nervously pulls her keys
a can of mace dangles from the keychain
students throw frisbee in the street
ray walks to his old truck which is wedged between a new sport utility and a bmw
he clambers into the front seat
then digs into his pocket and pulls out the unmistakable shape of an engagement ring box
he throws it in the glove box starts the truck and drives away
julie opens the door and steps inside
she locks three deadbolts
she stands there alone listening to the silence
she doesnt even have a cat
a faucet drips in the kitchen
the faucet drips
julie turns the handle
she checks the lock on each window
she stands for a moment
she picks up a bag of chips and eats a handful
she opens the fridge and takes out a can of nacho cheese sauce
she grabs a soft drink and a jar of bread and butter pickles
she gets some cookies from a shelf
opens the freezer pulls out some fat free sorbet
she takes the whole mess toward her bedroom
she hits the light switch
a bedside light goes on
its a sparsely furnished room
the bed is pilled high with pillows
she checks the windows then climbs into bed with the food
on the bedside table are pictures of family and friends
she looks at one of helen and barry
she looks around the room
outside we hear young people having fun slamming car doors going places
she picks at the food then puts it on the table
she turns off the bedside light and enjoys the golden late afternoon glow in the room
julie sound asleep is curled into fetal position on the bed
theres a click in the front hall
julies eyes shoot open
another sound almost like the front door being closed
her arm reaches for the bedside light
she hits the switch
the bulb whispers okay
face your fears
she gets off the bed and stands still
julie contd whisper theres nothing
theres another noise down the hall
julie contd whisper quiet
julie silently scoots out of her bedroom toward the kitchen
she gets a large knife
it sounds like somones in the living room
she steps through the kitchen door
as she moves we see a shadow pass the other way down the hallway toward her bedroom
theres no one there
julie contd okay calm down imagination
she relaxes until she sees that her front door is slightly ajar light from the hallway slanting through
julie contd i cant take this anymore
holding the knife in front of her she tiptoes to the hallway
theres a soft rustling coning from her bedroom
she gets a flashlight out of a drawer and starts down the hallway
julie contd fatalistic lets just do it
she moves faster toward her bedroom
she listens outside the doorway
it sounds like someones in the closet
she moves into the room
theres a noise in the darkened closet
julie moves into position
she turns the flashlight on and lunges for the closet
karla wilson all grace and attitude is on tiptoes reaching for a box of shoes
they both scream together
julie drops the knife and flashlight
i thought you were out of town
what are you doing in my closet
they hug jumping up and down with relief
i thought you were out of town
what are you doing in my closet
i just wanted your black pants but im not ready to die for them
julie turns on the light in the hallway
karla has her shoes in her hand and black pants draped over her arm
that was heart attack time karla
when i put these skinny pants on my body
now thats heart attack time
karla looks down and sees the knife
she picks it up with two fingers karla contd and were going to put away the utensils and youre coming with me
julie flops down on her bed
im not going anywhere
im fat ugly and depressed
yeah right whatever
i think i just really hurt rays feelings
keeping it upbeat listen to me julie
rays a great guy nothing against old ray but hes so
i mean he lives in southport
wills a nice guy too and he lives right down the street
karla picks up the flashlight and goes into the closet
theres nothing between will and me
she emerges with clothes for julie
holds up one outfit
karla contd what we gotta do is keep moving
no time to mope
im working at the club tonight
and you dancing queen are coming with me
no im not
karla holds up another dress for julie strapless sexy the one
fine then be fat ugly and depressed
karla is dancing around
julie laughs at her friend and takes the dress when karla hands it to her
its a hopping college joint crowded loud music a dance floor and rivers of cheap booze
julie sits next to karla as she waits for her drink order
a handsome young man slides in front of them
this is tyrell martin handsome no pretention a little dangerous with a killer smile
you know what i want to do to you right now dont you
theres gotta be somewhere we can be alone
playful i dont think so
its pretty crowded
just for a minute baby
i got something i wanna tell you
hes looking for a dark corner or a storeroom or something
teasing if you can say all you gotta say in a minute then i dont wanna hear it
ill talk real slow
hes kissing her ear
she starts to giggle
the bartender sets down drinks on karlas tray
re julie ask her to dance
karla contd go on
karla cuts away through the crowd delivering drinks
tyrell turns to julie
youre the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight jules
tyrell you are an unstoppable force of nature
its how the species survives
youll never convince me otherwise
beat wanna dance
karla passes by say yes
no means yes
tyrell i appreciate it but have you seen my people dance
we make the mouth face we move the fingers heading for the floor worse comes to worse you can stand there and watch me
come on ill take a break and well all dance
is packed and thumping
karla is dancing her way through the crowd
tyrell and julie follow behind her
karla sees will
hes dressed up and nervous
karla contd whaddayou know
will benson lookin fine
suspicious but having fun karla
did you tell him id be here
i told him that you absolutely positively would not be here at this bar between ten oclock and eleven oclock tonight
and then he came anyway
shy to a fault this was not my idea
i said this
do you want a drink
will looks down at his feet
he and julie stand there not quite knowing what to do
where i come from you want to snatch the goodies you got to at least talk to them first
tyrell and karla go for it on the dance floor leaving will and julie alone
they look at each other
they look at everyone dancing
how about a drink
will is a few steps ahead as they move for the bar
julie seems to be relaxing having a good time
then she looks up into the balcony and sees in a strobe lights flash watching her intently
she squints for a better look but hes gone
yelling over the din you okay
shes chalk white and crestfallen
her whole affect is will i ever have a normal time
she drifts amay toward the stairs to the balcony
will contd hey julie
will catches karla and tyrells eyes
julie catches another glimps of the slicker
she pushes her way through the crowd up the stairs
julie looks all around finally spotting the man in the slicker from behind making his way to the other side
he slices through a crowd of students and julie keeps following
he turns down a service corridor
julie follows frightened but unable to resist
she catches him at the end of the corridor
she reaches out and grabs the strangers arm
the stranger turns around
its only a club kid in a tacky vinyl raincoat and hat
you following me up here
a come on well all right
julie turns away and hurries down the hallway
todd follows but his figure quickly fades
with morning sun filtering through her blinds julie wakes up to the strange sound of thumping
she gets out of bed and slowly exits the room
the noise gets louder as she heads down the hall
the noise is at its loudest julie reaches for a doorknob and yanks open the door
rocking and banging inside the closet
julie spins once again startled by karla who crosses to the dryer flipping open the lid and then jumping back to catch the shoes as they pop out on the
still sleepy that could break the machine
julie people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers
its a fact
the phone rings
karla looks at her watch
karla contd its tyrell
resigned the numbers unlisted

answering the phone hi ty
a dj for a local radio station booms from the phone

julie watches her friend get excited
mark in the morning

julie hits the speakerphone button and karla hangs up
the djs voice echos through the appartment
good then i hope you remember your geography karla because all you have to do to win is tell me the capital of brazil
karlas smile abruptly fades
into phone brazil
she looks to julie whose face is as blank as hers

shrugs south america

karla reads the label blurting rio de janeiro

bells and whistles and triumphant music

i won i won i won
teasing now lets see
theres tyrell thats one
and theres my parents and i got some cousins
beat okay julie you can come but mark said four tickets
that means you gotta get yourself a date
julie thinks she seems torn
a small mound of red snapper is dumped wiggling and suffocating its way across the deck of a fishing boat
we pull away to reveal its ray whos just done the dumping
a coworker dave friendly playful and down to earth calls out from the dock hey ray
ray takes the phone
ray is happy to hear her voice but cautious
im really glad you called
compassoinate no you dont have to be sorry
im the one no i shouldnt have left so fast

dave holds up two wriggling snappers
he dances them toward each other in a puppetlike mating ritual making kissing sounds and narrating as the fish julie i love you
i know im only a humble fish but if you really look at it youre a fish too
girl voice oh ray youre right
do me like a snapper
mashing the fish together hey something smells like fish
ray waves him away concentrating on his call
ray karla won a trip to the bahamas
an island called tower bay
and she wants us to come with her
daves interest is piqued
wed have a long weekend just to sit in the sun drink fruity drinks and swim and
sexy you know
dave is watching ray closely
rays expression hardens

karla is watching julie
its not you its southport
and its the bahamas

karla is watching julie
you gotta sell his butt on the bahamas

dave looks at him like hes crazy

dave moves one of the fish like its been shot through the heart

i really miss you
she hangs up and karla sits next to her
that boy has got fish on the brain
sensitive hey cheer up charlie
singing a rumba were going to the bahamas
bahama mama yeah
ray is staring unhappily at the little pile of snapper
dave is staring at him in disbelief
man what is your problem
we havent caught anything for days
pull the big ugly stick out of your butt
she asked you to go to the bahamas
man you gotta go
well both drive up
i got friends i can see up there
ray realizes how right he is
what were you thinkng
ray looks at dave a contemplative beat then walks over to his truck
he leans in the passenger side and pulls out the engagement ring box
dave walks over
you wanna see what ive been thinking
he holds up the box and slowly opens it
dave is stunned
jeez ray fourth and forty throw the bomb
i should go up there
i should call her back tell her im coming
no way man
shell be psyched
ray is excited by the plan and daves right there with him
we stare out at a rain soaked stretch of road
a pickup roars past cruising along with its radio loud and windows rolled down
the musics even louder in here
the mood is high
two buddies going to propose to a girl
dave adjusts the radio to another am station man i love am radio
you got right wing conspiracy tips for pregnant womem single a baseball games and real country music
none of that new crap
he adjusts the dial again tuning in a country song mamas dont let your babies grow up to be cowboys by waylon jennings and willie nelson
dave starts singing along extra loud and out of tune
dave contd singing
mamas dont let your babies grow up to be cowboys dont let em pick guitars and drive them old trucks
let em be doctors and lawyers and such
ray looks at his goofy friend singing and starts to get a little happy himself
then ray sees something in the road ahead
he turns down the radio
they both stare its hazards blinking
ray slows and creeps past the car
the drivers door is open
it appears empty
is sprawled out in the road away from the car
ray pulls over to the shoulder and stops
nervous i dont know man
maybe we should keep going find a phone no
the guy looks dead
ray has seen this before maybe not
he throws open his door
ray steps from his truck
looks back at the empty car then turns toward the body
buddy whats up
the body doesnt move
and behind dave in the other car a figure in a slicker sits up in the back seat and gets out of the car
ray continues toward the body
ray moves closer to the all to familiar image
slicker figure moves toward the unsuspecting dave
dave watches ray in the road
he leans across the seat and rolls up rays window
behind him the slicker figure gets closer moving to the passenger side of the truck
ray nears the body
he kneels down
hey can you hear me
ray reaches toward the body
something flashes in the side view mirror
ray turns over the body
something isnt right
ray jumps back its eerie smile mocking ray who turns for the truck
dave hears something
he turns to late
the fisherman jams his hook through daves jaw and skull and yanks dave out of the dave
theres no answer from dead dave
ray tries to see around the headlights
he moves slowly toward the truck
the brights and fogs come on blinding ray
the trucks engine revs
the truck rolls a few inches adjusting a bead on ray
then tires spinning the truck launches straight at ray
ray runs at the truck
at the last minute he ducks behind the parked car
his truck goes screaming past
ray backs around the car goes barreling by in the other direction
ray dives out of the way
ray is exposed
he sees his truck closing fast
hes got nowhere to go
then at the very last second jumps off the edge of the road
his truck slams into the barrier right ray falls through the air
lands hard on his leg
tumbles down the hill finally stopping with a crash
he lies motionless at the bottom of a ravine
karla exits the building
she watches julie sitting on the curb
a truck turns onto the street
julie looks hopeful but its not ray
karla approaches her friend
girl its gettin down to the wire
hes not coming
i thought he was just
julie you left four messages
but he said hed try
he said hed try
try is like maybe
try is nothing
appoligizing for him he does work hard
work hard huh
hes breaking your heart just because he can
hesitant and i dont want to have to say i told you so
a jeep cherokee stops and an ebullient tyrell steps out wearing shorts and a hawaiian shirt
hey baby we gonna get tropical or we gonna get tropical
the passenger door opens and will benson steps hesitantly around the jeep
re will hey sorry
quick playing it off hes my friend too
and that ticket is not going to waste
will reads julies expression
julie is everything cool
i said we start having fun
and that means now
julie takes a last look up the street
is there a problem here
where theres a will theres a way
deciding you know what
were going to the bahamas
will is relieved
getting into the spirit we goin bahamas im tys bahama mama
we goin bahamas
she bops over to tyrell
a wide body jet screams through the clouds
a nearly empty jet
karla has her head on tyrells shoulder
julie is reading a book
wills knuckles are white from gripping the armrests in fear and his eyes are clenched shut
julie looks on with concern
just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood
what if i dont have anything happy from childhood
sorry i cant relax going five hundred miles an hour or four thousand four hundred feet a minute
calculating which is over seven hundred feet a second
imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second
deep breaths no deep breaths fumes build up in the fuel tanks
you can by surface to air missiles over the internet
planes use o rings
which freeze in tap water
planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all
youve got a better chance of getting hit by lightning
planes get hit by lightning
they get hit by meteors
they hit other planes
tyrell shakes his head
exasperated something is gonna hit your butt if you dont quit complaining
sypathetic honey some folks just cant fly
will doesnt move frozen with fear of flying but more closely bonded with the concerned julie
a board of tourism kind of shot
a boat chugs by with the words tower bay painted on the side
tyrell throws up over the side
more of a small tub than a ferry
julie karla will and tyrell are the only passengers
at the bow julie and karla laugh and play king of the world
julie in the prow karla behind her
deadpan im the king of the world
deadpan no im the king of the world
they switch places
they look at each other and crack up laughing
karla takes in the surroundings the salt spray the day remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin i do
for a weekend once every ten years
sharing the moment i will and you remind me of the same thing
they throws their arms around each other and stare into the horizon
will talks to a very green tyrell
you just gotta breathe
tyrell is trying to keep from puking cant talk right now
slightly malicious see its not a macho thing
its about equilibrium in your inner ear
you couldve used a patch but its too late now
get used to it
then some folks just cant sail
paulsen the boat captain overhears as he passes thats too bad too because its the only way on or off the island
slightly ominous unless you have an accident
and then they call the coast guard
julie and karla have rejoined the men
its pretty remote here
thats what the tourists pay for sun sea and solitude
are we there yet
few more minutes
we move off the boat and reveal the island
the intrepid vacationers excitedly take in the island
an isolated tropical paradise with jungle growing to the beach
the ferry pulls in to a canopied dock
a white sand beach stretches in every direction
beautiful tourists stroll about without a care in the world
tyrell stamps his feet on the dock
i feel like im still on that thing
a dockhand derrick glides past him toward the ladies
that way for a complimentary planters punch to get you readjusted
mile wide smile i can get used to this
derrick reaches for julies hand clearly checking her out in the process
welcome fair princess to tower bay
a wink im derrick
at your service for the duration of your stay
julie smiles politely
will gently nudges her on
they walk away
to derrick mocking im at your service princess
shrugs seasons over old man
so i gotta work fast
if marine radios right about the weather youre already out of time
he hangs a sign at the end of the gangplank
it reads last departing our guys are already at the end of the dock
an opulent carribean style hacienda resort with all the accoutrements
the main building is two stories high with a tiled roof
a bell tower rises from one side
and of course it is surounded on all sides by suffocating fooliage
julie and karla take in the beauty of the resort
check it out
catch the eyes of tyrell and will
karla thwacks him on the back of the head but theyre all having fun
the path widens
the trees part
its even nicer up close
they walk across a tiled plaza
behind them three young guys carry their girlfriends piggyback racing each other toward the departure dock
our two arriving couples move on toward the entrace passing a fenced tennis court on the left
a glass paned orchid house straight ahead
and on the right a lush pool with a built in jacuzzi in the shallow end
an outdoor thatched roof bar stands nearby and just beyonk it a small pool a guys unintelligible rasta voice calls out anybudorsomethin
they turn to see titus white guy dreads full rasta demeanor
hes a phony but sincere about it
titus approaches tyrell my brother can i interest you in the islands finest ganja
teasing hey tyrell we found you brother

titus contd how bout you ladies
titus moves his hips
titus contd lascivious something i can do for you
karla looks him up and down wrinkles her nose take a bath maybe
thats cold but if thats how you want it
the group moves on
titus watches them go titus contd yelling after them anybudorsomethin you come and see me
around twenty to thirty guests are on their way out as julie and the others walk in
julie smiles at an old porter helping the departing guests with their bags
he doesnt smile back
the hotel is tastefully appointed with island decor
an ornate metal staircase leads up to the rooms and down as the sign says to a in one direction the foyer meets the entrance to a tropical restaurant bar
and in the other a looby lounge is visible surrounded by four walls of books and hotel memorabilia
in a dark corner of the room a uniformed maid named olga dusts off a massive wooden globe
julie smiles at the woman on their way through the lobby but olga shyly looks away
arriving at the front desk the four of them find it deserted
they wait patiently then impatiently
as karla slaps it with her palm
the bell rings for a long time then fades into silence
where is everyone
ill ask julie turns to consult the maid
the big ball is spinning
but olga is no longer in sight
tyrell heads toward a door beside the counter with a sign which reads ill scare somebody up
he grabs the knob and pulls the door open to
a pit bull on a chain jumps up into his face its toothy maw snapping shut about a half inch from his nose
tyrell contd whoa
julie and karla laugh
karla goes to hit the bell once more only to karla gasps
we see the hand belongs to the hotel manager brooks balding s talks slowly and seems to have secrets he wont share with guests
what can i do for you
will saunters away to look at the books in the lobby
condescending ah yes
roll out the red carpet
our contest winners are here at last
he scans a sheet as tyrell stares at the pit bull
ive found peices of guys like you in his stool
tyrell is put off by this aggressive comment
whats your problem buddy
innocent i dont have a problem in the world
covering it sure is a beautiful old hotel
proud built in for a member of the rockefeller clan
the tile work was imported from spain
a lot of history in these walls
judy garland stayed here
hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock okay we get it

creepy thing to say
slides a registration form
brooks contd wilson comma karla
sees something on the form oh oh what
brooks covers youre in and
expecting this is that bad

tyrell wraps his arms around karla
julie looks uncomfortably towards will
i take it you kids havent exchanged vows yet

excited thatll be just fine with us
and while youre here our marginally trained off season staff of five will attend to your every need
did you say off season
july fourth weekend
storm season starts today
the clouds roll in like clockwork
its our version of winter
hands over the keys and
theres scrabble and parcheesi in the lobby
and brooks turns away through the office door
they walk toward their rooms
will catches up with them
they walk down the hallway
karla seems annoyed
aint nothin free in this world
everybody says it and its true
dissapointed i wanted you all to have a good trip
we will baby
all this means is we got the whole island to ourselves
and its been blue skies all day
it might be perfect all weekend
it beets being on the mainland
oooh the mainland somebodys gone tropical on us baby
the mood is improving
a squeeking noise interupts
a brass luggage cart has appeared behind them
and estes s the weary haitian porter steps from behind it
a carribean accent and
who put you in
hesitant dont use these much suspicious whys that
he sees their happy expectant faces and changes the subject
no real reason
then pretty fancy rooms for kids your age
we won a competition
what you have to do
guess the capital of brazil rio baby
ahh good for you girl
waiting for a cue and where would you like me to put the bags
a beat as julie and karla exchange a look
then karla tosses one of the keys to julie
to estes their stuff in there
grabbing tyrell and ours in here
looking at tyrell i also promised tyrell
promised me what baby
joking around i made all my promises to william
tyrell makes fake goo goo eyes at will
estes looks away
tyrell contd sweetie you brought your nightie didnt you
a girl needs time to make up his mind
to julie thoughtful julie look if its cool ill sleep on the couch and they can have their own room to practice for that real honeymoon
but tyrell grabs karla and drags her into the room
we here giggles
ill take those
no ive been doing this since before you were a dream in your fathers eye
estes grabs the bags and takes them into the room
julie and will are left staring at each other
you sure its okay with you
noting his sweetness sure
as long as you dont snore
you can toss a shoe at me if it gets out of hand
she laughs and they go into the room
ray is hooked up to a heart monitor
although hes asleep we can tell hes bruised and generally beaten up
we rack to a doctor checking on him through the glass
we see a cop next to the doctor
hes beaten up pretty bad yes but he seemed certain his friend was killed out on the highway by somebody named ben willis
hisitant he said he has a hook on his hand
he said he was driving a bmw
as the cop stares at him deadpan the doctor realizes how rediculous this must sound
close up rays eyes pop open
the cop explains things to the doctor
theres no body
and there was no other vehical involved
beat he fell asleep at the wheel
and ran his old truck into a guardrail
he got thrown way the hell down into a ditch
hes damn lucky
they walk back down the icu
nodding he suffered a severe head trauma probably once he rests up itll all come back to him
the doctor and cop approach the nurses station
the nurse is reading a magazine
she folds it away
suddenly the monitoring equpment goes off with a series of loud already moving thats your number twelve the doctor nurse and country cop hurry back toward rays room
nurse contd yelling get me some help down here
we got a flatline room twelve
the wires and monitors are unhooked and ray is gone
a resort bar on the beach
ocean breezes and surf sounds come through the window
its tiki galore complete with a bamboo bar and fishing gear hanging from decorative nets from the ceiling
theres a karaoke stage in the corner
will and tyrell enter and head straight to the bar
a bored bar tender nancy looks just like jennifer esposito doesnt look up from her paperback

nancy continues making their cocktails
backs into something turns and gasps its a statue of an old whaler complete with harpoon white beard and yellow slicker

they all pick up their drinks

nancy looks straight at will make fun of tourists mainly
beat or let them make fun of themselves
she flips a switch that lights the karaoke stage
dont even think about it
okay i wont
shes already heading for the stage
close on the karaoke machine
karla flips through a binder full of songs
oh this aint for me baby this is for somebody who really needs it
finds one ah hah
one single with extra cheese
its true everyone thinks their a singer
come on itll be fun
ladies and gentlemen please put your hands together for my friend my very best friend julie james
but there will be no mercy
chanting in unison ju lie
reluctantly she goes to the song book
she sees something particularily awful
you asked for it
to tyrell song number thirty nine
tyrell nods and punches a few buttons
julie takes the stage as sappy strings begin to swell
she looks at the monitor then melodramatically at the crowd and begins to sing no belt gloria gaynors i will survive
julie contd singing first i was afraid
i was petrified
continues singing under will stands clapping
tyrell pounds his chest
karla flips up her lighter swaying like a hard core fan
and julie continues crooning out the chorus as the beat kicks in and the gang begins to dance
julie contd singing i will survive
i will survive
the schmaltzy lyrics keep scrolling by white against black
in the middle of the song
the color changes
red capital julie contd singing then trailing off and i still know
what you did
her voice trails
her smile abruptly fades
falls to the floor
the room echoes with an electronic whump
everyone stops dancing confused
trembling shaking a mess
will jumps onstage
what do you mean julie
he did something to the screen
it it said
julie loos at the screen the normal lyrics are still scrolling
she suddenly feels their eyes upon her
theyre looking at her like shes having a nervous breakdown
julie contd nothing
nothing im sorry
stung she rushes off the stage
but its to late
shes bolted from the bar
julie steps into her room
closes the door behind her
she falls back against it trying to calm herself down
theres no way
just stop it right now
she looks around the cozy room
julie contd closet
no need to panic
julie starts to undress get ready for bed the day of travel finally catching up with her
she grabs something to sleep in
tosses it on the bed
and thats when she sees it propped on the pillows
her name written across
she is frozen momentarily
almost against her will she moves toward the envelope
she reaches down and picks it up
she hesitates then opens the envelope
she pulls out a single white in bold print it reads surprise
appears over julies shoulder
julie can feel the presence
she spins scaring who yells and drops the flowers and champagne he was holding
the bottle bursts and covers them with spray
realizing oh will
its my fault
i shouldnt have
i didnt think
she grabs a towel off the bathroom door trying to help him clean up the mess
no no no
this was really sweet
i scared you i crossed the line no its not that
im just a little on edge
im really sorry
hey you dont have to appologize to me
im the one
covering the awkwardness im going to take a walk and dry off
are you sure
i really appreciate it
he picks up a rose
most of its petals on the floor
i just really like you and i want you to feel good about everything
i want you to be happy
he hands the rose to her
theres a moment between them
he reluctantly heads for the door
will looks down at his wet pants
passing karla and tyrells room on his way down the hall will spots the do not disturb sign
he hears an incredible pounding from inside
he shakes his head and mopes down the hall
karla bounces playfully on their big bed as tyrell crosses toward the windows
bounce ive decided
bounce im changing my major to finance
bounce and going to wall street
cause thats the only way im ever gonna be able to afford a big bed like this
she falls back against the plush comforter looking up at herself in a long mirror hanging right over the bed
tyrell loves this and quickly moves beside her in the bed
she lets him get real close then she jumps up karla contd jacuzzi
tyrell reaches for her but she bounces off the bed
ah baby lets stay right here
karla pulls her suit out of a bag and models it seductively and flirtatiously for tyrell
i spent a hundred bucks on it
even if its just so you can pull it off
tyrell gets off the bed i like the sound of this
derrick the dockhand whistles in the darkness as he coils the bow rope of a service boat around a cleat on the dock
ominous shadows play all along the dock
out on the water theres a big splash
the dockhand rises looking out at the water with a sigh
i shouldve brought my pole
he turns away
as he does we see where a sinister slicker figure stands perfectly still silhouetted by moonlight
derrick paces down the dock the other way past a handfull of other tied off staff and service boats
he picks up a hose and begins spraying down the hull of a sunfish sailboat
he turns the hose off and begins coiling it backing toward an equipment shack
suddenly a hand touches him on the back
he jumps and turns to see standing there smoking a spliff
get lost you scared me
fish are all over the water
come on let us take a boat out
titus youre so stoned youd end up in spain
thats why youll come with titus mon
derrick throws the hose in its place
theres a storm comin titus
no boats are going out
storm is what makes it interesting
thass why all the fish are up
less hook us a couple big ones
derrick is now ignoring titus
i got work to do
take the bake elsewhere
up tighteous and self righteous
titus glides away into the dark
derrick watches him go
theres another splash in the water near the dock
derrick walks to where the splash was
he kneels down by the edge watching bubbles rise from the dark water below
to the fish hello little sea bass
youre lucky im busy or id hook you myself
derrick hears a splash and just in time for
as poor derricks blood mixes with bubbles
bubbles of a different kind
the jacuzzi sits in an enclosure at the shallow end of the swimming pool
and enjoying its warmth karla and tyrell are liplocked in the churning tub
music plays on the boombox beside them
the tempurature rises and tys hands begin to wander
still clad in her cute bikini karla pulls away you sure you didnt pick up my hair tie
rubbing his bald head hello
okay i just didnt wanna get my hair wet
baby i finally got you alone in this jacuzzi and i dont wanna be discussin hair care
she splashes him
dont you get feisty
tyrell moves in for the kill
he wont take no for an answer
too late for that
were miles from anywhere baby
no ones gonna hear you scream
he goes in for a serious kiss
things start to heat up i used to be a lifeguard
id hate to have to blow my whistle
playful id hate for you to have to blow
tyrell is done talking
he pulls her over to him and the moment becomes more passionate
karla opens her eyes in time to see surface in the pool next to them
and not just because it was a surprise
titus looks even uglier when hes wet
titus opens his mouth reveals a smoking philly blunt on the end of his tounge
no water sports after midnight
titus eyes karla in the jacuzzi
tyrell moves protectively in front of her
whats the policy on burnin herb
we got one for that too
its dont try until you buy
beat you dont buy any you dont get any
titus blows a cloud of smoke on them both rolls the joint back into his mouth and swims off
tyrell is angry but karla pulls him back
a dejected will appears in his bathing suit a towel over his arm
tyrell sees him coming
theres ten people on this whole island and theyre all gonna end up in this jacuzzi with us
getting in hows the water
will slips into the water ignoring tyrells look
ahh that feels great
considerate hows julie
in the room
to karla got any advise
find another jacuzzi
karla shoots tyrell a look
to will your not out yet slugger
you gotta just get back up there and keep swingin
ray is at a telephone booth up the street from julies apartment
he looks exausted
blood seeps through his shirt
hes in pain
i need an international operator
in the empty night lobby behind the desk rings and rings
we push in on the phone ringing unanswered in the night
nobody is around to answer it
the door creaks open once again to her room
and from a strangers pov a cloud of steam billows from the open bathroom
the sound of a shower is heard
we move toward it
eyes closed julie stands with her face right under the showerhead trying to relax
something softly goes thump
julie opens her eyes
turns off the shower
stands there frozen listening
calling out will
in a robe with a towel on her head julie peeks into her room
she sighs and crosses back to the bathroom sink
julie looks to a spot where her toothbrush should be
some of her things are missing
she peers into the fogged up bathroom mirror
she whips the towel off her head and wipes it across the mirror ready to spit she looks down
and in that instant we see a shadowy figure pass behind her in the bedroom
she looks back up
and hes gone
julie turns on the water to rinse
as it slowly creaks shut the sound drowned out by the sink
julie turns off the water and klunk klunk and noise at her door
the sound stops
she steps out of the bathroom crossing toward the door
she peers through the peephole
julie contd is that you
she unlocks and opens it
julie quickly closes the door and relocks it her heart rate just begining to rise again as
she hears it again
then the sound stops
but standing at the door she realizes thats not where it came from
her eyes immediately go to
thats where it came from
she slowy pads across the room in her slippers toward the door
she reaches for the handle
and theres nothing
she stares a beat
drip drip drip
she sees something on the floor of the closet
she touches a finger to it
she looks up
comes dropping down at her dangling enmeshed in barbed wire
hes dying before our eyes
blood bubbling from his mouth
his body twitching
julie stares at the body
shes almost catatonic
she blinks again
suddenly in death convulsions his arms fly toward her she screams karla and tyrell are drying off beside will as their hysterical friend comes racing across the pool plaza
its happening again
theres a body
will cathes her in his arms and she sobs uncontrollably
what are you talking about
its in my room
they can see shes not fooling around
everyone is gathered in the center of julies room
julie is held tight by will
brooks the hotel manager conducts the investigation
brooks approaches the closet door
julie holds her breath
he throws it open
a long beat
i dont find this at all funny
julie steps in stares into the empty closet
she cant believe her eyes
she searches their faces looking for someone to believe her
there was a body
i swear it
delicately julie you said you were tired
waybe you were dreaming
sharp i wasnt dreaming
i knew you people were goining to be trouble
i knew from the first time i laid eyes on you
julie grabs brooks by his robe
listen to me
who is here
she doesnt know where to start
nancy pokes her head around the door
whats going on
julie thinks theres a dead guy in the closet
the rest of us see bathrobes
sharp i am not crazy tyrell
he was right there
not taking it seriously fine
show me the body
will wanders over to the closet and checks it out
think about this julie
what did you actually see
the dockhand guy
hanging by his neck from up there
case closed in the morning well talk to derrick the dockhand guy and put the whole thing to rest
looks to nancy now lets slow down on the dark and stormies and get some sleep
dont look at me i want off this island
tired not possible im afraid
the last ferry left hours ago
and we got a storm coming
there wont be another one for days
theres a storm coming
tis the season like i told you
its a big one
julie goes for the phone
then ill call the mainland for a charter
phones went down a few minutes ago
she picks up the phone listens then dangles it from her hand
an exasperated brooks heads for the door
the next couple of days is gonna be rough but well make it
what about a radio
what the hell would you call this
id call this four spoiled city kids who wouldnt know a hurricane if it blew up their butts
beat all we can do now is batten down and ride it out
if things get really bad theres a storm shelter
and brooks is gone
outside the window it starts to rain
theres a clap of thunder
looks out the window with glazed over eyes
and we pull away from julies face through the glass slowly tilting above her room to another in the bell tower
a candle burns and lighning flashes illuminate the haggard face of estes the porter
its a claustrophobic room
estes turns away from the window shirtless in his uniform pants
a beaded cord hangs around his neck small fishhook dangling from it
beside the candle he picks up a leather bag and dumps out a handful of voodoo icons roots coins sea glass chickens foot
he sets them on a divination tray
he opens vials and sprinkles powder and assorted liquids into a small wooden bowl
he opens a drawer and extracts a toothbrush
he dips the brush in the bowl covering its bristles with a sticky goo
he holds the brush over the candles flame
the old man watches it sizzle
estes picks up and impales it on his fishhook necklace
his eyes roll back in his head
he enters a trance
olga the maid pushes her laundry cart toward the end of a long dimly lit hall
she sees a pile of dirty linens outside of a room she stops perplexed
theres nobody staying in this room
she picks them up and stuff them in her cart
then she knocks on the door
she knocks again and notices her hand leaving bloody marks on the door
she looks at her other hand
her arms and hands are covered in blood
she turns back to the linens
something bloody is wrapped inside of them
she paws at the sheets trying to unravel the mystery the door the room slowly cracks open
a steel hook reaches out and slices into her apron
she turns and she starts to scream she is yanked into the room
a do not disturb sign flips over the handle and the door slams shut
we hear her screams from inside
bars on the windows
neon pawn fickering
hand painted sign reads se habla ingles
rays engagement ring
the pawn shop owner mac cowboy hat knows his job holds it up to the viewing loop next to his eye
jeez thats a full carat how much
well theres some flaws in her
mac looks around his shop at the usual jumble of crap vacuum cleaners golf clubs guitar amps
dont really have the market for something like this
like it hurts him i can go two
make it three hundred
and throw that in too
encased in a glass cabinet
hell thats worth three easy
and you got your waiting period
im not waiting
so give me the gun and keep the ring
mac barely hasitates he knows hes getting a steal fine buddy
go down on the counter next to each other
mac pulls out some forms
mac contd fill these out
leave the dates blank
ray starts writing
mac is overcome by a moment of humanity
mac contd buddy are you sure this is the way you want to go
ray gives him a steely stare is it loaded
mac shakes his head
ray contd load it
off macs sadness at young people today
we move into the hotel room and gradually reveal four sets of feet at the end of one bed
they are crammed into a king size bed together
julie is awake
she gets out of bed and moves toward the window
its raining outside
the wind is blowing
the storm has arrived
karla pulls a sleeping hand off her chest
the hand belongs to will
she pinches the hand
tyrell kicks his feet around trying to get some room
this aint the romantic weekend i had in mind
karla kisses tyrell on the cheek
to julie you get any sleep at all
tyrell glares at julie by the window
sees the incredible rain
another day in paradise with julie your tour director
miss psychotic episode
hey calling to julie see any dead bodies out there
any fresh kill
how bout freddy jason
julie ignores him staring out the window
leave her alone
angry at her boyfriend karla gets out of bed and joins julie
im just saying what all of you are thinking
its bad enough gettin rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time
you dont have to be a jerk
karla pulls julie close in a show of support for her friend whose mind everyone believes has been inventing dead bodies
he doesnt believe me
thats his right
im starting to think im crazy too
hey slow down turn off the little motor up in there
what do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress
julie doesnt look to enthusiastic
karla and julie enter the gym
it has nautilus machines treadmills life cycles free weights tanning beds speed and heavy bags
karla walks over and does a full roundhouse spinning and planting her foot dead center of the heavy bag
ill be givin your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it
julie smiles at her friend bravado
she steps over to a stairmaster and starts her workout
will and tyrell step out of the room into the long empty corridor
they cross to a balcony overlooking the lobby
the whole place seems deserted
where is everybody
gallows humor theyre all dead
dead i tell you
ghostly ahhhh were all deaaaddddd
tyrellll joinnnn usss
wills voice echoes across the lobby
tyrell is maybe a little nervous but hiding it
they walk down the steps to the lobby
they cross the lobby
calling out hello
worried theres nobody here tyrell
tyrells already out the front entrance
will and tyrell exit the hotel and make their way down the steps outside and go splashing across the flooded grounds
debris from the storm is scattered all around them
they just dont care about us cause were the contest winners
beat lets go find stoner boy
make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or ping pong paddles or something
nervous you know the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression hey shut up okay
tyrell keeps walking
will looks around at the wind and water swept vista
not much of a day for activities
sotto i dont like to fish
tyrell moves across the grounds
he looks back
will is stopped in his tracks looking up at estes staring down at them
calling to will you coming
will trots after him but he takes a glance back at the window
estes is gone
julie has finished on the stairmaster
both she and karla are sweaty after a good workout
their moods have improved
come on vampira
i got just the thing for you
karla leads julie over to the tanning beds
cancer in a box
no this is the safe sun
joking its better than a day at the beach
julie is reluctant
karla contd come on a little photosynthesis and youll feel like a new houseplant
karla opens the canopy of the tanning bed
julie peels off her sweats
lies down in her underwear
straps on a small pair of goggles
karla lowers the canopy over julie
karla sets the dial
karla contd set to three seventy five bake for one hour
come to life julie is bathed in purple light
tyrell looks across the grounds and sees at the far end of the tennis court half obscured by the heavy fooliage surrounding the court
tyrell walks away from will toward the cart
he hears the jam box on the cart playing trenchtown rock by bob marley
one good thing about music
when it hits you feel no pain
the open door of the entrance clangs against the fence in the wind
tyrell decides to cut through the court to the far entrance and the cart
tyrell walks across the court to the sagging net
there is a rustling in the foliage around the court
something moving fast and quietly
calling out hey bong marley
the door slams shut behind him
tyrell looks back at the door
the latch seems to have stuck and its no longer swinging
tyrell turns back toward the other door and sees the pit bull standing in the doorway
tyrell stares at the dog
the dog growls at tyrell low and menacing
im gonna kill you bong boy
simultaneously tyrell turns and the dog lunges forward
tyrell sprints to the door its locked by a length of metal slipped into the coupling
he turns to see the dog bounding at him tyrell leaps up the fence just as the pit bull lunges for him
the dog catches his pant leg
tyrell kicks him away and frantically scrambles up
the dog relentlessly barks and snaps as tyrell climbs the fence
looks in at the dog angrily charging the chain link
he looks up at tyrell
ive got you
he reaches out to try and catch tyrell
tyrell finally looses his grip and falls back landing on top of will
he rolls quickly to his feet
furious i gotta find me a pool boy
karla hammers the bag with a series of quick punches
she finally stops to catch her breath and hears a thumping from the other room
karla sticks her head out the door to the gym listening
at the end of the hall is visible a single bare bulb lighting the room
karla moves curiously toward it
karla slowly sticks her head around the corner just as the thumping noise sounds loundly
she reacts in a small laundry room
doing julie gee karla
thatll break the machine
she approaches the machine which is rocking with the noise
karla contd damn
how many pairs you got in there
she opens the dryer door and jumps back
flies out and into her arms
she looks down a beat and screams bloody murder
a hot spray of blood gushes from the machine
tumbling inside the dryer
karla screams again
then she hears the sound of heavy boots coming down the hall
she runs to the door and locks it
shes trapped in a bloody basement cell
suddenly somebody pounds on the door
she runs across the room shoving a folding table toward a row of the door is hit again and again
somebody is throwing their shoulder against it
karla bangs hysterically on the windows leaving bloody handprints on the panes
julies eyes suddenly open through the goggles
she thumbs off her you say something
and just as julie lies down again karlas frantic screams echo down the hall
julie goes to push open the canopy
as she does the canopy lid is jammed down on top of her
a chain shoots through the handles
julie is locked on the grill
julie contd karla
hey this isnt funny
suddenly the lights go off
julie thrashes around trying to free herself
she sees someone walking around in the room
the person steps closer
julie could almost reach out and touch him
she begins to scream
tyrell angrily makes his way past the outdoor pool bar as will follows
tyrell spots a tray of empty bottles
he picks one up and smashes it in half on the ground
he holds out the jagged bottle to will
and do what with it
tyrell breaks another bottle in half
julienne of pool boy
they move toward the nearby pool house
tyrell and will stop outside the door
theres music from inside
more bob marley lively up yourself
tyrell contd im gonna throw the door
tyrell opens the door and charges in
wills right behind him
they spill into the room
a light fog hangs in the air
the two of them begin to cough and choke
titus sits on the floor facing away from them facing a window through which gray light pierces the gloom
titus doesnt move
hes too still
in front of him is a large bong that still smokes slightly
hey pool boy
tyrell closes the distance and kicks titus in the back
titus falls over like a block of wood rictus already setting in
his hands are bound behind him
the cord is tied off to some pipes against the wall
into the floor scrabbling for the window and fresh air
will points out two empty one gallon plastic bottles
one is labeled chlorine the other muriatic acid
will pulls tyrell from the pool house
the two of them collapse coughing and choking
will splashes a puddle of rainwater on his face thats chlorine and muriatic acid
put the two together and you get cyanide
tyrell rolls over on his back next to will practically coughing up a lung
like poison gas
reality dawning you mean somebody really killed him
suddenly they both hear karla screaming
they sprint for the main building
tyrell and will follow karlas cries to a narrow srip of basement window which runs along the side of the hotel
her palms have bloodied one of the windows
get back karla ducks down on the table just as the window explodes inward
tyrell kicks in the pane and looks in
tyrell contd give me your hand
she reaches for him
he pulls her up and out through the window
karla tumbles to the ground with only one thing to say
tyrell and will suddenly burst through the door
where julie is just visible her fingers madly groping for a way out
oh god get me out
get me out
will struggles to open the bed but the chain holds strong
tyrell grabs a nearby dumbbell
tyrell slams the barbell down shattering the fiberglass handles
a few of the ultraviolet tubes pop as will yanks up on the cover
they help julie up her eyes adjusting to non purple light
almost relieved im not crazy
im not crazy
already moving for the door weve got to get to the radio and call for help
i think we can classify this as an emergency situation
they head for the managers office
they burst into the middle of the room before seeing that brookss head has a machete sticking out of it
yo brooks listen up reacting whoa tyrell will and karla look at the radio which is smashed on the floor next to brooks
julie stares in shock at the reverse wall at with the words i still know written on it in blood
karla screams somebody
is a sick fingerpainting psycho
we gotta get out of here
the power cuts out and the hotel plunges into darkness
julie screams and runs from the hotel
julie runs down the steps and cuts through the blowing palms
julie is at the end of the dock
tears are streaming down her face her chest heaving
the others catch up with her
karla realizes the boats are gone
everyone is freaking out
there were boats here
refresh my memory there were boats
tyrell picks up the end of a cut mooring line they were cut loose
wanna tell us what is going on here
they look at julie
their escape is cut off by water
freaking out were all going to die
hes going to kill us one by one
not this again oh stop it
you killed him
now get over it
we gotta think here
they never found the body
her voice is low and urgent an impromptu confessional
julie contd two summers ago
we lied to the authorities
we hit ben willis with our car
ray me barry and helen we threw the body in the water to cover it up julie
only he wasnt dead
he killed barry and helen last july fourth
tyrell begins backing away from julie
he picks up a piece of driftwood from the dock
julie contd i thought ray and i killed him on the boat but we didnt and now hes back to finish up the job
tyrell holds up the log as a weapon
hes angry and afraid were on an island miles from anywhere
i dont give a crap about youre fisherman
theres dead bodies pilling up everywhere and theres one guy missing will moves closer to tyrell the porter
whats his name
old asbestos estes
thats exactly who it is
that old guy knows something
we can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first
tyrell turns and heads down the dock
will goes with him
karla takes a few hesitant steps after them then turns back toward julie who hasnt moved
julie we have to do something
julie sees her friend caught in the middle sees her suffering
she reluctantly starts for karla sotto its not him
standard bus folks old people in panama hats buzz cut military geeks on holiday
ray sits in a seat
hes in pain and does not look good
he pops a handful of pills into his mouth and washes them down with an orange crush a dignified old lady has been watching him people live healthy in miami
sincere but unsettling its the future down there every day of the week
ray slumps back waiting for the pills to work
ill keep that in mind
the door to estess room bangs inward
tyrell will karla and julie charge into the room
yo freak boy the cluttered room is empty
hes not here
tyrell and will begin roughly searching through estess possessions
were gonna find some weird crap in here
in the corner there is a curtain used as a partition
julie pulls the curtain back and discovers sitting in the corner
it seems to glow from inside while casting an evil pall over the room
julie moves toward it and hesitates before opening the doors
inside is a small voodoo shrine
a candle has burned low before it
hanging before the altar is impaled on a fishhook
i told you
julie looks closer
she sees her toothbrush a hair tie assorted other knickknacks belonging to her friends
to karla missing a hair tie
karla looks in
tyrell snatches the straw man up
we found our guy
thunder rumbles across the sky like the judgement of god
julie karla tyrell and will walk quickly down the corridor
they have grabbed some of their things
we gotta find flashlights torches guns if they got em anything thatll help
will and tyrell eye the stairs leading down to the lobby
maybe hes down there collecting the body parts
will and tyrell exchange a glance an are you man enough
kind of glance
the men head into the kitchen and bar area
well only be a second okay
yeah wait right here its the safest place
karla is terrified and waits by the stairs but something catches julies eye
she walks across the lobby
julie where are you going
julie keeps walking
she sees historical pictures of the hotel work crews during construction the first limbo contest fishermen standing next to sailfish and marlin
near the pictures julie sees the globe
its spinning slowly
julie hesitates then walks toward the globe
it stops spinning
she looks down at it
and julies hand finding brazil
we see the capital is not rio but brazilia
this is dawning on julie when we hear estes v
she jumps out of her skin
estes was standing right there in the shadows
estes contd thats the capital of brazil not rio
tyrell comes flying across the lobby past karla
he dives on estes tackling him to the floor
will is right behind him
i got him
we got you
leave him alone
tyrell holds up battered estes heres youre killer no we found your voodoo crap no they shake estes finally giving him a chance to speak
estes contd i found the bodies this morning
i tried to use the radio but he already destroyed it
let him go
i believe him
come on julie
you saw his room
i havent hurt anyone
i stole those things to help you
to protect you
hes telling the truth
he couldve easily killed me
beat while this sinks in look we didnt even answer the radio question right
this whole thing was a setup
what do you mean
rio isnt the capital of brazil
it was the wrong answer
sorry we lose
starting to lose it youve got all these theories but where is he
wheres your fisherman killer
i dont know
losing it you never do
the guy at the nightclub the body in your room last night
little notes that only mean something to you
how do we even know youre not the one behind this estes steps forward to tyrell how do we know youre not
to julie i know who youre talking about
he used to work here at the hotel
beat and ive seen him around again
out in the woods by the orchard
they look at estes
is he telling the truth
i cant remeber his name but i dont forget a face
beseeching i can show you
they stare a beat how do we know youre not setting us up
where else you gonna go son
they look to the office the gym
the sense of death surrounding them
i know i dont want to stay in here
well be better off in the open
if we stick together maybe we can kill this creep for good
they begin moving for the door
the rain pounds a fleet of fishing boats
the boats are securely battened down in the weather
ray limps past heading for a small building at the end of the dock
its sign reads island ferry jack paulsen proprieter
a gear strewn office
paulsen watches an episode of party of five
there is a loud knocking at the door
paulsen slowly gets up
he cracks the door open
ray stands silhouetted against the rain
i need to get to tower bay island
paulsen senses something isnt right
ray pushes his way in i need to get there now
paulsen looks at him standing there drenched
did you happen to notice whats going on outside
ray pulls out the gun and points it at paulsen im not looking for a weather report im looking for a boat
so which ones yours
estes will tyrell julie and karla walk along a trail through the heart of the island
the storm has abated for a few minutes
its windy dark and spooky
the kind of place youd take people if you wanted to scare them with a classic ghost story
that is just what estes is doing
he worked here for many years
he had a nice family
a pretty wife and two little ones
a boy and a girl
theyd be about your age now
they continue along the path
estes looks at them in the dark slowing for just a second
estes contd one day his wife went missing
maid found blood all over the honeymoon suite room
there are strange noises out in the woods
estes contd eventually they found her body
a leg in the swamp
an arm washed up on three mile beach
beat and the head they found much later
a huge branch is blown from a tree and comes crashing down through the underbrush scaring them
estes calmly steps around it
estes contd careful softly did he do it
people say she was running around on him
people say he caught her in bed with other men
people say a lot of things
beat he disappeared taking the two small ones with him
at least they were never found
the winding path leads to a small orchard
they hang on his every word
estes contd were here
in the center of the orchard is a cemetery
they move off the path into the safety of the woods
there seems to be activity around the place
its silent and eerie
julie stares fascinated
she is slowly drawn toward the house
karla grabs for her arm
be careful julie
ive got to see
she leads they follow circling the house
julie rounds a corner of the shack and stops
she sees the first stone reads sarah willis birth death the second stone reads susie willis birth death beyond them and the group moves slowly toward it
the headstone partially obscured by the mound of dirt comes into view
the third headstone reads born september died july a lying whore a lying whore is scratched with a knife
realizing todays july fourth
will goes to comfort julie im not dying on this island will
louder do you hear me
julie shouts into the darkness
julie contd you want me ben willis
come and get me
im right here
she kicks over her headstone julie contd my grave stays empty
she looks defiantly down the path
julie the boats are gone the phones are down
theres no way off this place
then we fight will looks around
estes is gone
whered estes go
what is up with that weirdo
ill go find him
he cant help us
hes probably the only one who can help us
ill come with you
are you crazy

he couldnt have gone far
ill catch up with you later
will disappears into the darkness
maybe we should just wait here
hide in a tree
im not hiding up no tree
to julie im with her
lets arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psychos butt
they move cautiously into the kitchen
blue emergency lights flicker above them
its a big room with plenty of nooks and crannies for somebody to be hiding in
tyrell picks up a couple of different knives
he hefts them in his hand
what i need is a gun
not a steak knife
karla grabs a paring knife tyrell contd you gonna clean vegetables
you gonna stir fry
you need something thatll get his attention
he picks up a huge butchers knife and cuts the air with it
he then roughly empties other drawers looking for more weapons
karla looks to julie something on her mind
julie catches the look
hurt im your best friend
you could have told me the truth about what happened
i wouldve understood
sad karla i just wanted the whole thing to be over
i didnt want to involve anybody else
its too late for that
julie steps over to karla
im so sorry
i brought this on everyone
its my fault
tyrell picks up on the mood swing
he moves closer to them
you didnt do nothing
this fishermans a piece of scum
hard for him to admit i shouldve been listening to you
julie smiles for a second
tyrell contd now lets take a look at the pantry
you think thats a good place to hide
i dont know but im starving
will runs from the trees and finds himself by an old house
he sees estes by the ocean near a boat
whered you go
estes doesnt answer right away he keeps his back to will
will contd you abandoning us
how come you didnt tell us you had a boat
estes picks up the boats oar
he speaks low almost inaudibly
this has to end
estes swings the oar cracking wills head hard
tyrell julie and karla approach the pantry a huge steel door
tyrell steps inside
he starts looking for something to eat clank
theres a soft clattering from somewhere in the room
everyone freezes staring into the darkness
tyrell puts a finger to his lips then creeps down an aisle listening
theres nothing but silence
he moves toward the first aisle
he jumps out
the aisle is empty
move down an aisle behind him
tyrell ducks around to the second aisle
he slices the air ready to pounce
this aisle is empty
nervously move another aisle down
tyrell moves stealthily toward the third aisle
this is it
he lunges forward into the row
theres a small sound
a mouse scampers off under the shelves
tyrell turns and smiles at karla and julie its just a bashes him on the back of the head
tyrell hits the floor unconscious
a dark figure jumps down from the shelves
tyrell puts his arms up yelling for mercy dont kill me wait its nancy nancy the bartender steps out of the shadows brandishing her rolling pin
tyrell stands at the sink where karla holds a towel full of ice to his head
nancy the bartender looks on apologetically
im sorry but you couldve been the one doing all of this and so could you crazy fool
you stumbled into my hiding place
must have missed the sign
excuse me but this island didnt have a murder rate until you people showed up
chilled ive never seen a dead body before
get used to it
whos doing this
friendly dont even get her started
its a long long story and you probably wouldnt believe a word of it
tyrell moves as he talks fed up and exhasted
he crosses past the stove and under a huge hanging rack of pots and pans
tyrell contd i mean all i know for sure is this is the worst vacation of my life
im tired and im hungry and i personally havent seen one damn psycho killer
sinks deep into the base of tyrells shaved skull a look of abject surprise on his face
the women freeze as tyrell dances like a marionette before being hoisted up and hung on the rack like a used saucepan
is in the vent above the stove
he stares out at them from the hood of his slicker
ben jumps from the range onto the floor
karla is in shock
julie yanks her and they flee
as she goes julie picks up and hides it in her back pocket
ray pilots the boat through the dark choppy water
hes navigating by compass maps spread before him
he sees something off the bow drifting on the fast sea
the words tower bay are painted on the side
ray pulls alongside and discovers the boat is empty
he reaches for the radio
into radio come in
this is summer breeze requesting emergency assistance for tower bay island
this is summer breeze
ray guns the boat away
julie karla and nancy run into the lobby
the storm is wailing outside the front doors
they pause for a second
behind them we hear the rapid thud thud thud of bens boots
nancy goes straight to a desk and pulls out a flashlight
she points to the main staircase
i know where we can hide
the women run up the stairs
behind them we hear bens footfalls echoing
on the top floor they race toward the end of a dark hallway
at the far end of the hall nancy illuminates a section of the ceiling
give me a boost up julie helps nancy reach a pull cord in the ceiling
nancy quickly climbs up
enters the hallway and continues toward them
karla slips nearly knocking julie to the floor
they both scramble upwards ben hits the ladder just as julie reaches the top rung she screams nancy appears in the opening and throws a brick down at ben
it hits him in the chest and knocks him back
julie makes it into the attic
they pull the ladder up behind them like a drawbridge
julie karla and nancy surround the hatch theyve just shut
they fumble with it theres no way to lock it
what do we do
from below comes laughter
theres a tug on the hatch cracking it open
the girls pull it back shut but its hard to get a grip
theres more tugging the hatch bending down they can see ben
then the rope snaps
the hatch slams shut
theres no way to grip this thing
suddenly the steel tip of the hook pokes through the crack
it wriggles around
and begins to pull the hatch down
they try to hold it
but its no use
they let go and jump away
the attic is lit by a cathedral window
its crosshatched with wooden beams and pink insulation
watch your step
karlas foot goes through a gap between two beams
dangles through the ceiling
julie helps karla back up onto a beam
nancy contd stay on the beams
karla and julie follow her precarious progress
ben climbs off the ladder to a beam
he watches them leap from beam to beam
his hook glints in the light
julie karla and nancy move toward the cathedral window
they are cut off
they spread out against the wall looking for an opening to get back to the hatch
ben feints toward nancy then swipes at julie he misses
she leaps away
she looks down
instead of insulation she sees a she sees her bed through a one way mirror
julie stares momentarily transfixed
karla is edging her way around the side of ben
re the mirror youd be amazed by what youd see
my wife with every man on the island for example
to julie and you sexy
i loved watching you
you sick freak
ben suddenly whirls and lunges at karla
he grabs her but they both lose their balance teetering for a moment on one of the beams before falling they crash through the mirror karla and ben hit the
bed in a rain of glass
karla bounces to her feet and dives out of the way as ben swings his hook
karla backs onto the porch
she backs up against the railing
julie and nancy reach the cathedral window
they open it and look out
and ben advancing toward karla whose back is against the railing
karla looks behind her sees which doesnt look nealy strong enough to suppor her
ben advances swining the hook
karla leaps over the railing and onto the glass
karla keeps a wary eye on ben as she gingerly backs up on the glass
the glass begins cracking subtle crack lines splintering out from her footsteps
ben lunges and swipes at her with his hook
karla leans away from the attack and loses her balance slipping onto her back on the glass
she lifts her head
starts to move
the glass is fracuring beneath her
she looks through the glass
she tries to slide toward a support
the glass creaks and moans as she moves across the room
to herself oh god no shes almost to the support when taking karla down into the orchid house
the roof shatters in an explosion of flying glass
karla land on her back
shes unconsious julie and nancy look at the empty space which once was a roof supporting karla screaming karla
ben turns and looks up at nancy and julie
then he sprints from the balcony
julie and nancy duck back into the attic
julie and nancy climb down into the hallway
they are cautious expecting ben at every turn
they hurry across the lobby
a sprawling steam filled room dense with vegetation of all sorts and shelf after shelf of beautiful orchids
karla lies unconscious
slowly she opens her eyes
theres a rustling in the flowers
she tries to get up but cant yet
she waits in terror as fly up and out of the hole shes made in the roof
karla tries to stand and her leg gives way
she tests her knee oww
karla starts hobbling
she reaches the door its locked from the other side
there is a thick glass window set in the middle of the door
the cranes startle again something upsetting them
karla spins to look
julie and nancy arrive at the door
karla pounds on the other side points to the lock
nancy sees a key ring by the door
its gotta be one of these
nancy tries the first of many keys
something catches julies eye
she moves in for a closer look
her eyes go wide a powerful bolt of lightning cracks
fills the room with a pulse of bright light
ben is standing inside and hes heading straight for terrified hes inside
her terrified scream blends with the cranes now shrieking violently
nancy fumbles with the keys
julie tries to keep calm
ben closes fast slicing the tops off orchids as he goes
he skewers a bud on the tip of his hook
karla pounds on the door
nancy fumbles for the right key but the lock is old
crying its jammed
the key is stuck
through glass come on
shes running out of time
julie sees a fire axe encased in the glass safety box
determined no way
julie smashes the glass with her elbow
grabs the axe
to nancy move
julie hammers the door with the axe
ben is almost on top of karla now
the axe breaks the glass pulls the frame out
julie drops the axe
they grab karla
pull her through
the hook rips karlas shoe but julie and nancy pull her through
julie and ben are face to face
julie has the axe in her hands
she stares him down
come on gimme a shot ben rips off his hook eyeing julie
shouting julie come on
ben tries the door realizes it had locked behind him
he cant fit through the circular window
he throws his shoulder against the door
the door frame starts to give julie karla and nancy approach the iron door to the underground storm cellar
julie carries the axe
its over there
they struggle together to open the heavy door
stairs lead down into darkness
karla hesitates i dont know
come on you can make it
julie gets in pulling karla in behind her
they pull the door closed behind them
theres a light somewhere
the darkness is complete
we hear movement
im right here
grab my hand
this place has emergency power
just ease you way down the stairs and ill find the light
im at the bottom
karla just get my hand
im holding your hand
no youre not
nancy pulls the chain on an overhead bulb
the lights go on illuminating of brooks derrick olga and titus whose hand karla is holding
the women scream
they muddle together trying to collect themselves
suddenly there is a pounding on the iron door
then julie remembers the axe
she motions the others to stay back all right the iron hatch is slowly opening
julie gets the axe into possition pokes his head through
hes clutching a piece of wood as a weapon
its you guys thank god
is everyone okay
they are ecstatic to see him
they bound up the concrete stairs helps here
will is already on the move toward the hotel

did you get help
will shakes his head
hes walking woozily
julie contd what happened
estes came after me with a gaffing hook

i guess so
julie points out that his chest and stomach are covered in blood too
your stomach youre hurt will looks down clutches himself and keeps moving
when i was coming back i saw your slicker friend looking for you guys down by the water
beat lets hurry and get inside
ray guns the boat straight up onto the beach
he leaps from the boat
will slumps down on the bar floor
hes floating in and out of consciousness
julie leans over him concerned
oh my god youre bleeding to death
she looks back towards nancy julie contd we need a first aid kit
already moving i saw one in the lobby
karla starts then hesitates
will moans looks at her
nancy contd ill come with you
youll be okay
karla and nancy rush from the bar
julie looks tenderly at will
he looks back at her
she pulls some hair off his forehead
he smiles weakly
will just hold on
well get you fixed up
karla and nancy go to the area near the check in and behind the desk
look up there
ill look over here
karla looks behind the desk
nancy is searching the shelves
julie tenderly searches the area around wills stomach
shes fussing with the clothes looking for the wound
youve got blood everywhere but i cant find the wound
will takes her head in his hands looks her in the eye
thats because its not my blood
the slow change in julie as she realizes
she starts to run
will roughly grabs her
will contd its time you woke up julie
his voice switches to that of a familiar radio disk jockey
will contd as mark in the morning he drags her out of the bar
nancy sees a white metal box sitting on a shelf
she reaches for it
its a first aid kit
reaches over and lands on top of her hand
she jumps and sees estes right behind her
hes in on it
hes suddenly estess expression changes to surprise and appears in the front of his chest
nancy screams and looks over estess shoulder to see standing there holding a spear gun
estes topples over on top of nancy pinning her underneath his dying convulsing body
nancy struggles to get loose
karla rushes to nancy
she tugs on her arm trying to pull her free
the fisherman strides toward them
he raises his hook
he swings at karlas head
on a beam
karla struggle with nancy
come on come on
ben tries to free his hook hand
karla looks up at him
he calmly puts his foot onto estess back and steps down with all of his weight driving deep into nancy who expires with a sigh
karla contd damn you
karla blind with rage attacks the fisherman
he kicks out with a boot and sends karla fying onto in the lobby area
the table explodes
karla is finished
the fisherman works his hook free from the post
karla is unmoving and looks quite dead
will pulls julie along a muddy path in the rain
hes got her by the hair
shes slipping and falling
look at the bright side jules
we finally get to spend some quality time together
julies trying to get to the knife shes stashed in her back pocket
why are you doing this to me

i cant sleep
im not doing well in school
im having trouble with my boyfriend
i trusted you

i can tell you one thing though
ray didnt trust me
he was right
hes dead but he was right
they come into the orchard
they are covered in mud
julie stumbles again
goes to her knees
works the knife free and slashes up at will
she slices him across the face
he steps back feels the blood
will contd whatd you have to do that for
there is a creepy pause
will stares at his own blood
she catches her breath
then suddenly will knocks the knife from her hand
he lifts her by the hair
enraged he puches her in the face
she goes down
will has julie in a choke hold
he drags her toward the open graves
julie is losing energy slowly giving up
come on julie
youll get it
will benson bens son
he shoves her
she falls backward into the arms of ben willis
will contd hi dad
julie wails struggling wildly in bens grasp
thats my boy
ben holds her back to look at her
he throws back the hood of his slicker
we see his face clearly for the first time
no no no ben pulls off his hook and strokes julies cheek with his stump
no more screaming
no more running
time to die
let go of her
ben and will spin to see like the hero from a western step out from behind a tree
ben starts to laugh
will joins him
you gotta be kiddin me
whatre you gonna do boy
call us names
let her go
ray raises the
he cocks the hammer
ben doesnt let go of julie
lightning fast he slaps his hook back on and gets the point to julies neck
think about it boy
youre no killer
beat thats my job
ray hesitates his finger on the trigger
he does look scared
ben takes a step toward ray
then another pushing julie in front of him
will moves closer too
stop right there
rays finger squeezing down the trigger
you dont have it in you
suddenly will dives for ray
ray gets a shot off tagging ben in the shoulder
the gun goes flying
julie spins and hits ben in the face
he knocks her into her own grave
mud begins to slide in on her
she tries to scramble out
will and ray wrestle punching each other repeatedly in the face
will has ray down and his hands around his kneck
he looks him in the eye
we havent missed you down here ray boy
i got to know julie real well
will gets the better of ray
he yanks him up choking him
ray is begging to check out
will contd think of all the things im gonna do to her
beat dad finish him
ben charges toward rays back
he pulls back the hook for a roundhouse slashing at the last second ray dips elbows will
goes straight into wills chest
the fisherman has hooked his own son
father and son make final eye contact the sons eyes go blank
ben stares in shock as will expires falling back into the mud
ben screams in rage
ray is tired
ben begins beating ray
he puches him
he straight arms him with the hook
he knocks him again and again and ray is beaten giving up
ben has ray against a tombstone
the hook slowly inches toward his eye
gonna blind you first
the hook is touching the eyelid rings out
a look of wonder crosses bens face
he slowly turns away from ray
stands behind him holding the gun
she empties the gun into ben who flies backward into julies grave
as he tumbles ben releases the dirt stacked beside the grave
slowly covers ben up
bens face is covering over
his mouth starting to fill with dirt you cant kill me
his face is completely covered
his mouth still moving
ben contd ill always be with you
the dirt covers him
it continues to fill until just the waves futilely out of the dirt
then is stops wiggling
julie goes to ray
ray and julie limp across the grounds of the hotel
they are moving past some shrubbery when jumps out
she and ray jump back
stops in the middle of her kamikaze attack knife held out
oh god its you youre okay
they go to her jubilant group hug time
they compose themselves
karla contd you know its true what they say about package vacations
you get what you pay for
beat now how about we get off this piece of crap island
the first rays of the morning sun appear
ray looks adoringly at julie as the beautific light catches her face
ray kisses her
she kisses him back
they are silhouetted against a beautiful orange sunrise
smiling we dont have to tell anyone it rained the whole time
it can just be our little secret
the three of them throw their arms around each others shoulders and they start walking for the beach as
rises into view
the sun setting over a quaint street in a college town
julie pedals her bicycle down the street
she has a book bag over her shoulder
it feels like one of the first days of school
she rides the bike up to a small house on the perfect street
she rolls the bike right up to the front door
julie lets herself into the house
she leans her bike against another bike in the hallway
its a perfect day
wind in the willows
theres another noise
from inside her house
she goes perfectly still
behind her by the kitchen the shadow of a figure moves
she creeps down the hallway toward her kitchen
she pauses the dark figure almost knocks into her
hes holding a disemboweled toaster
what are you doing
its not working right
youre home early
sees shes shaken did i scare you
never do that again
tender hey i didnt know you were here
beat we got the refrigerator in
she sees the love in his eyes
she hugs him
i love it here
its gonna be great
julie climbs to the top of the stairs
she passes ray in the bathroom
she pauses in the doorway ray is at the sink in boxer shorts
hes using an electric waterpic devicice that has just been opened a gift from the party
it makes a low whirring sound
seeing her checking the locks again
you know me to well
julie smile and walks to the bedroom
julie climbs into bed with a book
the bedroom is clean and orderly
the windows are closed
the closet door is shut
the room is decorated simply a high antique bed unopened boxes a highboy an antique mirror leaning against the wall
a stuffed bear sits in a chair
there is a clatter from another room
she hears it again
she climbs out of bed
julie walks into the dark spare bedroom
the clattering sound comes from the open window
the wind is blowing the blinds
she shuts the window
as she leaves the room we notice the dirty imprint of a boot below the window
julie passes ray who is still absorbed with the new toy
behind him the door softly closes
the lock twists
ray is oblivious happy being the dental hygene pacesetter of the household
julie enters the room
she looks at the closet door
it is open a crack
she hesitates trying to remember if it was open before it wasnt
julie approaches the closet
she catches her refelction in the mirror next to the closet
she peers into the crack of the closet
she cant see anything
she throws open the closet door
she looks around the room
what is my problem
she sits down on the bed
we see her bare feet from under the bed
she smiles relaxes
she looks in the mirror leaning against the wall
something has caught her eye
she turns slowly back to the reflection in the mirror
she sees the glint of steel julie turns too late the fisherman lunges out and grabs her legs
she goes down her nails scrape into the wooden floor as she is dragged under the bed
