written by sonny mallhi revision by frank baldwin april sunlight pours through the window of an empty silent dorm room
the room seems alive somehow
as if its waiting patiently for this years kids
a long beat
the room darkens for an instant
just the sun right dipping behind a cloud
over credits we pan down a hallway full of college kids
they carry boxes stereo speakers stand around chatting
sara matthews gets out of a taxi in front of a dorm
shes pretty with optimistic eyes and brown hair cut just above her shoulders
shes dressed casually but still chic
she carries a backpack on one shoulder a duffle bag on the other and a huge suitcase in her hand
and shes staring through the buildings window at
newly minted college students milling about inside
their parents in tow pride and sadness mingled in their faces
sara walks to the registration table
a resident assistant smiles up at her
she looks her up in the computer
she plays with a simple silver chain around her neck
des moines iowa
she says it nicely but it still stings
sara smiles gamely
youre in room three sixteen
she hands sara a room key
she fingers it smiling
elevator doors open on sara as she
pushes an ancient flat bed cart out of the elevator and down the hall struggling to control its wobbly wheels
she bumps into other carts but everyone just laughs it off
sara stops in front of room
she opens the door and looks in on a run of the mill freshman dorm room
tiny bathroom down the hall twin beds
sara steps in
she looks at the two empty beds
big choice here
she drops her stuff on the bed by the window
she sits down on it
im really here
first things first sara takes a framed picture out of her duffle bag and sets it on the dresser
its a picture of a young girl maybe ten
she looks a little like sara
sara hauls a white styrofoam design mannequin off the cart
its full of pin and chalk marks
she sets it by her bed
told you wed make it
she steps back to the doorway
as she hauls her suitcase off the cart
another cart slams into hers
a box tumbles off the other cart
sara kneels to help the other girl cute frizzy hair clean up the mess
a slew of clothes lie on the carpet
and peeking out from under them
a bottle of vodka
the girl smiles sheepishly
in case of emergency
balancing boxes they manage to shake hands
a gorgeous fall day
sara strolls across the quad taking it all in
kids tossing frisbees
sunning on the grass
music pours out of speakers mounted in dorm windows
saras cell phone buzzes
she answers it
yeah its amazing here
i met this really cool biker
hes taking me to mexico this weekend
just tell him im kidding
sara stops in front of the campus coffee shop
she eyes a work study ad on the wall
no shes not here yet so i got to choose my side of the room
she tears a tab off the flyer
establishing shot of carnegie a solid red brick dorm
saras half settled in now
the wall beside her bed is peppered with fashion pages ripped out of vogue and in style
she sits in a lounge chair paging through a vanity fair photo shoot
she spots a cool outfit and tears out the page
a knock on the door
sara walks over
she opens it expectantly to see
tracy tracys roommate kim and two other hallmates
all dressed to party
s throwing a bash
theyre a frat
i dont know
i might just hang and wait for my roommate
groans all around
sara bites her lip considering
just let me change
the girls cheer
establishing shot of a proud frat house
students piled on a giant porch and theres a long line going up the steps to the front door
music blasts out of the windows
sara tracy kim and the others from the floor are at the head of the line stepping into the house
theyre met by a motions to a crowded keg if you want beer ill need ids
for a frat party
he holds up a handful of ugly lime green wristbands
kim steps around him
i dont drink anyway
tracy looks at her mouth agape
theres punch and non alcoholic beer over there
he points to a table with a giant bowl and cups
no one is around it
tracy tries to flirt with the bouncer
come on just us
we wont tell
the bouncer is tempted but not budging
honestly im just a pledge
theyll kick me out
she stomps by him
defeated tracy walks over to the table
turns back to sara
you want something to drink
whats the point
tracy huffs as sara walks into a sea of kids
were talking extreme fire hazard
extreme moral hazard
sara moves through the crowd
her clothes are low wattage but stylish
shes drawn to the music coming from a large room
a high energy college band on stage
theyre not very good but they dont care
sara finds a spot along the wall and watches them
in particular the drummer
a cute goof spastically whaling away
hes mouthing the lyrics eyes closed
really into it
sara chuckles at the sight not taking her eyes off him
he definitely stands out
suddenly a hand grabs her shoulder
tracy pulls herself in with kim close behind and they start dancing to the band
juice spilling over the brim of her cup
sara stays by the wall afraid of getting any spilled on her
yells over the music why arent you dancing
theyre not that bad
tracy pulls sara deeper in the crowd
now all three start jumping up and down to the music
saras getting into it as tracy chugs her drink
a dj rules the room now
sara and kim are dancing with others from the floor
sara notices a speck of punch on her shirt
she stops dancing
wets her fingers and tries to rub it out
kim still dances as sara starts to look around
she was getting more punch
sara then spots tracy with a full cup precariously climbing onto the stage next to the djs table with a bunch of other girls already dancing
she starts dancing suggestively egging on the crowd
guys yell out
several hands armed with camera phones stretch out above the crowd
tracy cant hear her
sara starts making her way to the stage
tracy is dancing getting into it
she grabs the bottom of her shirt
teases the crowd
sara slams into stephen the drummer from the band
who inadvertently dumps his whole beer down her shirt
saras drenched as an enormous cheer erupts from the crowd
camera phones clicking all at once
sara looks up
i have to go clean this up
looks like my plan backfired
sara turns back towards him
to spill beer on you so i can start a conversation
you spilled beer on me purposely
she looks at him
pretty good looking
its hard to be mad at him
she then grabs a beer out of a dancing partiers hand and dumps it on stephen
ill get over it
he laughs making her smile
im not sure how shes so wasted
all shes had is punch
stephen grins conspiratorially and grabs her hand
stephen now with a full beer watches as sara sips some of the punch
its pretty good
she drinks some more
it doesnt taste that strong
he takes a drink of his beer as sara takes a long chug of hers
by the way
stephen and sara are dancing
shes holding her cup
drinking bumping into a couple of people
stephen laughs grabs her hand pulling her back towards him and twirls her bringing her close
she notices for the first time that hes not wearing a wristband and grabs his wrist with her other hand
hey why do you get to drink beer
tell me about it
my back is killing me
they dont move for a moment saras resting her back against his chest
besides frat brothers dont have to wear those ugly wristbands
youre in this frat
he jokingly untwirls her away and she bumps into people behind her
sara laughs as she notices kim dancing holding up a cup of punch
did you try the punch
its pretty good
what happened to tracy
im the worst roommate ever
kim goes back to dancing sara looks a little worried which stephen notices
do you want to look for your friend
sara looks at him sweetly
they spot tracy propped up against the railing at the bottom of the stairs
sara rushes over to her
a couple frat boys stand over her
not sure what to do with her
i got her
she struggles to hold tracy up the girls heavier than she looks and saras balance is not so great herself
the frat boys notice her struggling
whos got you
tracy nearly brings sara down to the floor
but stephens there to catch her
guess that would be me
but then he stumbles nearly dropping them both
whos got you
stephen looks at tracy in one arm
the other arm around saras waist
sara rolls her eyes
sara stephen and tracy stumble into the dorm lobby
sara wears a jacket stephen gave her for the walk
kim and another girl step forward and grab tracy
they linger smiling checking out stephen
they step into the elevator
holding it for sara
you want us to wait
sara turns and glares at kim
an obvious no
kim lets the doors close as sara turns back to stephen
you know im going to be pulling kitchen duty all week for helping girls leave a frat party
its like opposite everything we stand for
sara leans in and gives him a long kiss
then separates but her lips still very close to his
low and romantic does that make it worth it
she laughs out loud
do you want to come up
more than i can tell you but that wouldnt be fair
sara starts to take off stephens jacket
he stops her
till next time
and sorry about kitchen duty
and walks away into the night
sara looks after him
and now its her turn to take a deep breath which suddenly makes her a little more queasy
sara heads for her room holding onto the wall as she goes
she reaches her door
she takes one more deep breath then opens it
sara closes the door behind her
almost pitch black just a little moonlight through the window
sara knocks into her lounge chair
she reaches her bed and plops down on her back
clenching her eyes shut
the room is spinning
she may puke at any second
she struggles to sit up
she fumbles for the lamp next to her bed almost knocking it over
she hits the switch revealing the other bed
the girl takes her picture further blinding and disorienting sara
who are you
sara calms catching on
what are you doing
taking your picture
sara grabs her stomach
her cheeks chipmunk as she rushes out the door
sara gingerly walks out of the bathroom back to her room holding her head
the door is slightly open
rebeccas covers are pulled up to her neck
her eyes are closed
sara makes it back to her bed
she falls onto it and turns toward the wall
rebeccas eyes open
and they stay open
she watches sara go to sleep
its the middle of the day and students carry their books everywhere
headache dry mouth the works
the sun through the window is way too bright
she slowly turns over to see
rebecca up and about arranging her side of the room
in the light of day we see that shes a knockout
mellow music plays through top of the line speakers that flank an awesome stereo system
rebecca sees that saras awake
sara stares at her blankly
who is this girl
what happened last night
we met last night
racking her brain starts with a
she hands sara a glass of water and two aspirin
itll help trust me
sara washes down the aspirin
rebecca smiles genuinely touched
i didnt throw up on you did i
you made it to the bathroom
sara looks around the room
her lounge chair has been moved to her side
rebecca starts to tape drawings to the wall
theyre various self portraits of rebecca
sara looks at one where rebecca is staring straight back at us
did you do those
theyre really cool
i just like capturing my moods
sara closes her eyes
bits and pieces of the night before are coming back to her now
rebecca did you take my picture last night
its just something i do
for my drawings
cmon lets hit the bookstore
the walk will help your head
sara rolls over groaning
its too damn early for me
its three in the afternoon
saras eyes bug out
sara walks along the back aisle weighed down with textbooks
all look used and worn
she spots the last book she needs and reaches for it just as another girl reaches too
they both pull back neither sure who has claim to it
so what do we do
sara looks her over
checks out her outfit
sara snatches the book
im on financial aid
sara finds rebecca by the art supplies shes picking up the stuff she needs
sara scans rebeccas books
theyre all art books shiny and new
saras phone rings
she looks at it jason
her finger hovers over the talk button
she hits it right before it goes to voicemail
what are you doing
i just wanted to hear your voice
i told you not to do this
i need to talk to you
youre just making it harder
sara listen i
i want to come out there
but you didnt come out here remember
thats the problem
she says it too loud
other students in line are eyeing her
ive gotta go
sara hangs up
she exhales flustered
that didnt sound good
off rebeccas confused look
rebeccas warm smile makes sara want to open up
they walk along the stacks of books
we dated since tenth grade and were supposed to go to college together
we both applied to brown
i got in he got wait listed
i stuck to our agreement and we both committed here
then two weeks ago
a spot opened up at brown
he took it
sara nods glumly what an asshole
do you miss him
sometimes i think i do
its hard to let go
believe me i know
but youre in college now
a girls gotta move on
sara smiles glad to find a kindred spirit
she looks at her phone
and stuffs it into her pocket as they reach the register
rebecca sits on her bed drawing
sara is putting her books away on a shelf
as she reaches the end of it she notices something out of the corner of her eye
oh my god
sara walks to the closet
her modest clothes hang on one side
but the other side is now taken up by rebeccas killer i am so jealous
ive got a lot of clothes
mind if i put some on your side
borrow anything you want
i havent worn half of them
sara reverently fingers through them
de la renta
jimmy choo shoes
a miu miu handbag
some still carry their price tags
jesus some of these ive only ever seen in vogue
my parents idea of bonding is to turn me loose in beverly hills with a platinum card
oh you here
off saras confused look
about minutes away
you can go home on weekends
not gonna happen
sara gives her a puzzled stare
its a long story
lets just say nothings free in my house
she wants to know more
but its too soon to pry
she nods at rebeccas drawing pad
can i take a look
she walks over
rebecca clutches the pad to her chest
sara stops dead in her tracks
rebecca realizes that came across pretty harsh
not till its done
its just my
i wouldnt want to show you anything unless it was perfect
establishing shot of a big college cafeteria
sara and rebecca have just finished their dinner
i thought you were a design major
why are you taking calc and psychology
the girls get up with their trays
with a smirk i am
i want to be well rounded
off her look and theyre requirements
sara sees tracy sitting by the window with kim
sara walks over but rebecca doesnt follow
this is my roommate rebecca
she turns but rebecca is standing at a distance
sara waves her over
rebecca comes reluctantly
she flashes a small wave
what can we call you
how bout reba
tracy sticks her finger down her throat
i like becca
tracys grimace vetoes that one too
how bout becky
the girls all turn to rebecca for approval
i like rebecca
rebecca walks out
sara shrugs at tracy and kim
sara enters the design building
sara peeks in the open door of a classroom
frustration in her eyes the class she couldnt get into
she watches professor roberts long haired dashing lecture his students
here we are
and each one of you is asking yourself the same question
he taps his own chest who is this guy
why should i turn off my blackberry and pay attention to him
mild laughter from the class
ill tell you why because i hold the keys to the kingdom
think of your favorite designers
ive got news for you all of their magic stems from the same source the fundamental principles of design
i can teach you those principles
he lets the power of his words sink in
the journey to the catwalks of new york
starts right here in this room
and all you have to do is open your minds
man she wants in
sara stands by the door watching the students file out
as the last one leaves she screws up her courage and walks in
professor roberts is gathering up his papers
he flashes a disarming smile
im sorry to bother you its just
i absolutely must take this class
im afraid were full
but dont worry intro design has three other sections
but youre not teaching them
i want to learn from the best
he smiles at her
whats your name
i brought a request form
she holds it out to him
he takes the form but his eyes stay on sara
roaming over her
tell me sara why should i sign your request form when ive turned down a dozen others
would that be fair
saras face falls
a long beat
no i guess it wouldnt
she walks toward the door
roberts eyes go to her ass
who said life was fair
you happen to have two things i cant teach
he walks to her
and hands her the signed form
he smiles signs the form and hands it to sara
sara clutches the form to her chest smiling
sara and rebecca sit on their respective beds
rebecca listens to her walkman
sara types on her laptop
rebecca removes her earbud
whats your facebook page
ill add you as a friend
i dont have a facebook page
i dont spend a lot of time sara stares at rebecca
rebecca walks over and looks at the computer over saras shoulder
on computer screen saras facebook page
her picture in the corner
pictures and posts from a dozen friends
among them a stylish attractive woman in her s
she graduated from the art institute out here last year
shes an artist
a design apprentice for marc jacobs
hey check out these posts
sara scrolls down irenes recent posts paris was amazing
milan in the fall
off to barcelona
who doesnt have a facebook page
ill get one
tracy knocks on the partially open front door
and marches right in
cancel those library plans
guess who made the guest list at rebar
you guys in
i trust you have fake ids
yes you do
thanks to my badass self
tracy pulls out a fake id
she walks to rebecca and holds it out to her
a peace offering
rebecca stares at tracy for a beat
then goes back to her sketchbook
clubs really arent my scene
tracy stands there hung out to dry the id in her hand
a posh los angeles bar
loud and packed to the gills with mostly young students
sara and tracy stand at the bar getting jostled looking like
two naive college kids
as they try to get the bartenders attention older guys check them out smiling and mouthing hi
sara tries to ignore them but tracys in heaven
how great is this
they clink their empty glasses in a toast
she puts her wallet and cell phone into tracys purse
too bad rebecca blew us off
talk about the life of the party
dont be mean
im just saying
shes just a little hard to get to know
as tracy rolls her eyes
the bartender sets two drinks down in front of them
he nods down the bar at
two middle aged suits
tracy flashes them a smile
saras not so sure about this
what do you think
tracy raises her shot glass
she and sara clink and drink
tracy waves at the suits again
we can do better
she takes saras hand and pulls her out onto the dance floor
sara and tracy whirl in the hot mix of bodies
having the time of their lives
a handsome guy moves in his eyes on tracy
tracy loves it
they dance together as sara watches smiling
tracy and the handsome guy drift further away from sara
sara is now dancing by herself
a guy moves in on her but she politely dances away
she scans the dance floor for tracy
whered she go
she steps off the dance floor and scans the bar no sign of her
sara walks into the crowded ladies room
a bummed sara walks out of the club alone
she rubs her arms against the chill
she nervously tugs on her silver chain as she scans the stragglers loitering outside
she takes one last peek into the club doorway hoping against hope that tracy will magically appear
she starts walking down the street away from the club
weary and unnerved
rebecca lies in bed wide awake in the dark
her cell phone rings
she stares at it
two more rings
she picks it up
would you accept a collect call from
an old school gas station on a barren corner of the city
no cars in either direction
a lone white i bmw with a black soft top sits next to an ancient pump
rebecca half asleep climbs out and grabs the nozzle sticking it in the fuel tank
can i help you out
she turns to see a year old good looking gas station attendant
his name tag rick
rebecca sizes him up
just in a hurry
she keeps pumping
speeding it up
rick ambles up to her treading beyond appropriate personal space
he points to the full service sign
just doing my job
she stands her ground as he places his hand over hers on the gas pump and squeezes
she looks down at his hand on top of hers
then lets go of the pump nudging his hand away
she pulls the nozzle out of the tank and tries to place it back at the pump
he stops her
motions to her face
you have a little something
no she doesnt
he ever so gently rubs his index finger and thumb on her cheek to remove the imaginary smudge until he lurches back
his crotch is wet as gasoline drips from the nozzle
but she does it again holding the lever down dousing him head to toe
he scrambles backward out of range
the nozzles still in her hand pouring gas in every direction
she opens her car door grabbing a lighter
charges towards her
you spoiled c he spots the lighter in her hand
she absentmindedly flicks it
it sparks but doesnt light
the gas is now pouring towards him
the meter on the pump is still ticking up
he scrambles again as she casually flips the lighter at him and drops the still pouring nozzle
a hint of a grin and a pitying shake of her head as she pulls out a loose hundred dollar bill
places it on top of the pump
she gets into her car and drives off
leaving rick soaked in gasoline
sara sits by herself in a booth by the window
hugging a cup of hot sobering coffee
rebeccas car pulls up into a parking spot
the headlights shine right in saras eyes
and now turn off
saras tired eyes light up as she sees rebecca get out of the car
rebecca doesnt wave back as she heads for the door
rebecca walks up to saras booth
so wheres tracy
no idea i couldnt find her
rebecca sits down dropping her purse and keys on the table
as long as im here
sara smiles gratefully
rebecca opens the menu
i cant believe she ran out on you
thanks for coming
rebecca looks up from the menu
tracy had her shot tonight
tomorrow youre all mine
ill show you the big city
the right way
and i promise i wont abandon you
rebecca leads sara through the sculpture room
these are the modern pieces
a little wilder than the old stuff
shes a savvy tour guide confident at ease
she doesnt just walk past pieces she studies them
saras cell phone buzzes
she checks the display jason
she tilts it so that rebecca can see and rolls her eyes
she buries her cell phone in her purse
sara spots a bizarre metal structure and walks over to it
okay i have no idea what this is supposed to be
even i dont get that one
come on i want to show you something
rebecca shows sara into a room full of paintings
in the background is a banner announcing an upcoming richard prince exhibition
they stop in front of richard princes nurse of greenmeadow
its a portrait of a woman in a nurses mask
her eyes peer directly at the viewer
blood is smeared on her smock
this is my favorite
sara steps closer to examine it
rebecca stays behind her
i love how he captures her personality through her eyes
its like she really wants to help you
rebeccas hands tug anxiously at her shirt
she really wants sara to like this painting
sara moves even closer
she squints trying to see what rebecca sees
the womans expression in the painting is actually pretty sinister
saras a little freaked out
but she turns to see rebeccas hopeful expression
i love it
sara and rebecca window shop along a block of thrift stores
sara spots a graffiti laden wall next to a tattoo parlor
some first rate tagging here bright colors funky shapes
that is so cool
no graffiti in des moines
bobby loves jenny
chrissy loves rick
nothing like this
rebecca pulls out her camera
but now grabs rebecca and pulls her in
both of us
they both hold the camera extended at arms length
she looks at the picture
she can see the tattoo parlor in the background
now thats one art form i dont get
needles into skin
i have a tattoo
but she can see in saras eyes that shes serious
sara pulls down her shirt and sweater a bit to reveal over her heart a simple tattoo emily
my older sister
she died when i was nine
oh im sorry
pats her heart this keeps her with me
i always wanted a sister
sara smiles and interlocks her arm with rebeccas as they walk down the street
sara sits on her bed in sweats typing on her laptop
rebecca sits on her own bed glancing over at sara as she draws
guess who im listing as my favorite artist on my facebook page
rebecca smiles genuinely touched
she walks over to check out the rest of saras facebook favorites
favorite book favorite band etc
your favorite movie is coyote ugly
its about a small town girl making it in the big city
isnt every movie
they both laugh
sara in shorts and warm up jacket runs down the sidewalk
her heads on a swivel taking in the city sights
rebecca takes down a few of her drawings
in their place she puts up a big coyote ugly poster
she straightens it out
she checks her watch and walks to the window
she looks out anxious for sara to come home
she looks over at saras side of the room
curious she starts perusing her things
she walks to saras dresser and picks up the picture of emily
she tenderly brushes emilys face with her thumb
she spots saras silver chain
she picks it up and places it around her neck
she fingers it carefully and looks at herself in the mirror
sara finishes off her run strong striding out the last ten yards to the dorm
she catches her breath and hears a kitten
sara looks in between the columns outside the dorm and finds a stray kitten
shes cute as they come a black and white furball
the kitten purrs
look at you
she kneels and pets it
the kitten purrs
no collar baby
sara glances around to see if anyone is watching
sara quickly walks in and closes the door
rebecca sits in her windowsill drawing
sara sits down on her own bed
she notices the coyote ugly poster
i thought youd like it
rebecca sees the moving bulge under saras jacket
she cuts sara a look
apprehensively she unzips her jacket and the kitten pops out
rebecca sits up
the kitten jumps over to her bed
she pets it
i know i know
its stupid and ive just broken about forty different dorm rules and i should just take it to a shelter
what do you want to name it
saras face lights up
she smiles gratefully
itll be our secret
just between us
rebecca keeps petting the kitten
getting more attached
i named her in the elevator
she smiles and scoops her up
suddenly her smile vanishes
is that my necklace
rebecca touches it
shed forgotten she still had it on
i was just trying it on
sara puts down the kitten and walks to rebecca who quickly takes it off
sara takes it back annoyed
she rubs it protectively
this was my sisters
sara looks at it a moment longer
she looks at rebecca
you can borrow anything of mine
except for this
its the only thing i kept of hers
sara sits down on the bed next to her
im really sorry
you didnt know
were you two close
youre the first roommate ive had since she died
so it feels a little odd
in a good way or a bad way
a good way
establishing of life at the quads
a cool college hangout lined with old wooden tables and comfy couches
more like a living room than a coffee shop
lots of laid back students and
one stressed out sara dropping drinks off at a table and now rushing back to the register for the next order
her co worker clearly stoned moves in slow motion
not a care in his world
you wanted a mocha smoothie right
do you know whats in that
the kid shrugs
sara hops to the blender and guesses some ingredients
she starts it up
she takes her hand off the lid and
the blender explodes splashing mocha smoothie all over her apron
shes frozen in shock
the co worker casually hands her a towel
she snatches it
she turns to find
stephen standing at the front of the line
this seems like a pattern
shes psyched to see him in spite of the havoc
she leans in and speaks quietly
just because i kissed you doesnt mean ill let you cut in line
so what does it mean
she coyly shrugs
hey the gentlemen of psi upsilon are reviving a sacred tradition tonight
sara stares at him blankly
were having another keg party
im still having flashbacks from the last one
you know what
how about if i use you as my excuse not to go
sara smiles bits of smoothie dripping from her apron
sara walks off the elevator still sky high
she walks through the lounge where tracy sits on the couch
a television plays in the background
sara thinks about ignoring her but stops
her tone is cold
so you can ditch me again
the guy had a porsche
and a hot tub
thats your apology
tracy jumps up and walks over
what i meant to say is im sorry i totally screwed up
down the hall we see rebecca open her door and peek out
she watches tracy and sara
tracy gives sara sad puppy dog eyes
i forgive you
tracy gives her a big exaggerated hug
over saras shoulder she spots rebecca looking at them
tracy flashes a big smile
relief at making up with sara
but thats not how rebecca takes it
but youre on your own at psi u
someone has a date
rebecca hears this
she slips back into the room and closes the door
sara turns and walks down the hallway
sara walks in to find rebecca slipping into a black dress
richard prince is having a showing
i bought two tickets
since hes your favorite artist
sort of have a date
rebecca goes back to getting dressed
heavy silence in the room
sara watches her
you know i could reschedule
being a martyr you dont have to
i want to
on one condition
sara pulls a cute jacket from her closet and puts it on rebecca
they both look at rebecca in the mirror
i love it whos the designer
what are you a label whore
i got it at a flea market and it looks great with the dress
rebecca nods in agreement
it just needs one last touch
she grabs a pair of small gold hoop earrings from her dresser
she places them in rebeccas hand
im gonna jump in the shower then well head out
she grabs her stuff and hurries out the door
rebecca eyes the earrings in her palm
she turns towards the full length mirror behind the door
as she leans into the mirror we see that her ears arent pierced
she takes one of the earrings and touches the pin against the skin of her right lobe
after a moment of hesitation
she pushes the pin in hard
a small pop
blood trickles down her ear onto her neck
she wipes it off with her thumb and touches the other hoop to her left ear
sara and rebecca at the richard prince showing
the paintings are all similar to the one we saw in the museum
a series of women peering at the viewer
rebecca wears her hair up showing off her earrings
every guy in the room is checking out these two babes
but rebeccas into the art and sara is texting stephen
on cell phone sorry
next time rebecca notices and frowns
sara puts the phone away and starts studying the paintings
its night and theres not a soul in sight
we track slowly down the empty hallway towards the door to the
sara sleeps peacefully
cuddles lies on top of her awake
her eyes glowing in the dark
but not as creepy as
rebecca in the other bed
shes staring back at the kitten
envy in her eyes
or of sara
rebecca removes the covers and quietly gets out of bed
she walks over to saras bed
but not to pet cuddles
she stands directly above sara
looking down at her
if sara would simply open her eyes shed see her
tracy is passed out in her bed
she stirs as she wakes
she reaches around her slapping her end table
i need water
she stumbles to the mini fridge and looks in empty
she grabs an empty cup
opens her door
and lets out a sharp little scream
rebecca sits right across from tracys door her back against the wall
staring at tracy
what are you doing
rebecca cocks her head at tracy as if shes trying to comprehend her
and walks to her
tracy takes a step back shaken by rebeccas calm morose demeanor
rebecca stares right into her eyes
she makes a slight move towards tracy who flinches
rebecca turns and walks down to her room
at her door she turns and smiles
she disappears into her room
tracy stands there spooked
aerial view of sara and rebecca walking to class
tracy walks ten yards behind them waiting until
rebecca and sara wave goodbye to each other and head down different paths
tracy hurries after sara and catches up
how was the party
are you still the beer bong queen
but tracys in no mood to joke
she pulls sara to a stop
something is up with your roommate
what do you mean
she was outside my room this morning
waiting for me
i opened my door
and there she was
just sitting there staring
like some psycho
are you sure
you dont believe me
no its just
why would she do that
why dont you ask her
ive gotta go
ill see ya later
tracy stops and watches sara as she continues on
tracy turns to go the other way but before she leaves her eyes catch rebecca standing in front of a nearby building
rebecca stares at tracy much like she did in the hallway
tracy leaves in a hurry
sara sits in her design class
professor roberts stands at the podium
three white design mannequins behind him each sporting a different fashion style
contrary to popular opinion beauty is not in the eye of the beholder
its in the hands of the designer
sara listens intently soaking it all in
her cell buzzes with a text message
she discreetly takes a look
who can tell me the difference between fashion and style
from irene th ford
be there now
sara smiles at the message
professor roberts notices sara looking at her cell phone and calls on her
without missing a beat sara replies
fashions something you can buy but style you either have or you dont
all the money in the world cant buy you style
but it can buy you a good stylist
the class chuckles
professor roberts smiles
sara comes out of the building texting on her cell as she walks
rebecca is waiting holding two cups of coffee
howd you know when my class got out
rebecca shrugs playing it off
im your roommate
sara smiles and grabs a cup
they walk through the quads
other students are around some strolling leisurely others rushing to get to class
tracy told me something kinda weird
she says you
scared her this morning
rebecca stops and looks at sara
she starts laughing
its more like she scared me
she was racing to the bathroom like she was gonna hurl
she almost knocked me over
a beat as sara ponders it all
the girl does like to party
anyway i wouldnt worry about it
rebecca takes a victory sip as sara gets another text from irene where r u
i gotta go meet irene
raises her cup thanks for the coffee
rebecca watches her walk off
she takes another sip
sara gets out of a cab
she looks up at a big building
sara walks through a design studio
models and make up artists are rushing around dragging thousands of dollars worth of dresses
sara loves the places chaotic energy
she knocks on an open door and sees a young model being worked on by a designer who isnt much older
mouth full of pins finally
she gets up to hug sara
nearly tearing the dress
irene is putting a dress together on a model
sara watches in awe
an older designer walks by
checks on irenes work
nods his approval
i so want to be you when i grow up
hell i wanna be me when i grow up
shes going to be a star
irene rolls her eyes
you know your dad left me four messages last week
making sure im looking out for his baby
i hope you told him im closing down the library every night
i told him i havent seen you
and that for all i know youre a crack ho by now
even the model laughs
sara walks along looking for a table
she spots stephen sitting by himself
drumming on his leg with a pencil
ignoring the open textbook in front of him
she sits down across from him
they both smile
i havent seen you around too much since you blew me off for dinner
actually how about dinner tonight
she takes his book
hes on page two
yeah but its really dense
off saras smile
kim exits the bathroom and passes tracy coming the other way
hows it goin
tracy wearing just a towel and brushing her teeth as she walks steps into the bathroom
she hums to herself as she spits out the toothpaste
she removes the towel and steps into the shower pulling the curtain closed
as she shampoos her hair
the lights go out
you have to be kidding me
the only light is some distorted moonlight through the window
tracy steps out of the shower grabbing her towel
just as she starts to feel her way along the wall
the lights come back on
she sighs happily
sheds her towel
and steps back under the steaming water
the lights go off again
she turns off the shower
a beat of silence but now
one of the other showers turns on
what the hell
hey how about turning on the light
yet another shower turns on
whos out there
tracy back in her towel nervous now feels her way along the wall again
she turns on the lights
the curtains are drawn in front of both running showers
tracy stares at them
i know its you
she walks over to the shower
she rips away one curtain
nothing behind it but the running shower
she turns it off
she stares at the other curtain
sara thinks youre weird
she told me
she pulls back the other curtain
she turns off that shower too
but she can still hear running water
she looks back
the curtain from her own shower is closed again
the sound of running water behind it
she walks over
not funny rebecca
under her breath bitch
she grips the curtain
she steels herself
she yanks the curtain open to see
just running water
tracy shakes her head
she looks around no one
she slips her towel off and slips back under the water
screw rebecca shes going to finish this shower
just as the warm water starts to relax her
the shower curtain crashes over her pile driven by rebecca
the curtain comes right off the rings
tracy is slammed against the shower wall
she hits the floor hard with rebecca on top of her
water pelting them both
rebecca clamps a hand over tracys mouth and pins her against the wall
the shower curtain covers her from the neck down
tracy wide eyed and terrified stares at rebecca
so sara thinks im weird
let me tell you what i think
i think youre a little whore and a bad influence on her
and i think that if you tell anyone about
what im about to do
youll regret it
rebecca one hand still on tracys mouth slides her other hand beneath the shower curtain
tracys eyes widen further
rebecca finds what shes looking for
gets the grip she needs
and violently jerks her hand out of the curtain
a muffled scream from tracy
tears stream down her face
as tracy sobs quietly on the shower floor rebecca looks down at
the bloody ring in her hand
nice belly ring
she tosses it to tracy
and walks away
sara and stephen are sitting on a couch
his arm around her shoulder lightly playing with the ends of her hair
im going to flunk my test tomorrow thanks to you
then lets make sure it was worth it
she gives him a slow lingering kiss
duh jokes on you
i was going to flunk anyway
rebecca sits on her bed petting cuddles blood still on her fingers humming the tune that tracy was humming in the bathroom
she hears steps and voices in the hallway
she smiles must be sara
she quickly turns off the light and pretends to sleep
but the steps pass her door and keep going
she turns on the light
worry in her eyes
she picks up her cell phone and dials
sara and stephen step off the elevator
time to say goodbye
thanks for helping me
he kisses her
sweet and tender
sara sees rebecca
standing just five feet away
staring at them
where were you
i kept calling and calling
i turned my cell off at the library and forgot to turn it back on
this is stephen
he flashes a smile
rebecca doesnt even look at him
im going to bed now
im glad youre okay
she walks out of the lounge
that was awkward
sara bites her lip as if to say what can you do
you got a curfew
well shes right
i shoulda called
he smiles no big deal
he kisses her and steps into the elevator
they look at each other waiting for the ancient doors to close
stephen steps forward and sneaks in one more kiss
the doors close
sara smiles what a night
she glances down toward her door and sighs
sara and rebecca walk in silence sipping their coffees
rebecca looks straight ahead listening to her walkman
as they reach the fork in the path
i guess ill see you later
i was just worried about you
you dont need to worry about me
i can take care of myself
rebecca slowly nods
were good right
sara nods and smiles
sara and stephen at a table books spread around them
stephen is reading rolling stone
saras on her laptop checking her facebook page
she gets a message for adding a new friend
she clicks to add her
rebecca sits in a chair on the other side of the library
unbeknownst to sara and stephen rebecca watches them through the glass
sara clicks onto rebeccas facebook page
shes listed only one friend sara
shes posted the picture of her and sara in front of the graffiti wall
and some of her drawings
and a picture of a pretty brunette teenager captioned maria
sara looks at rebeccas interests
favorite artist richard prince
favorite passion drawing
favorite movie coyote ugly
best friend sara
her smile fades
im already her best friend
thats a little sad
but the look on her face says she agrees
maybe she really likes you
if you know what i mean
she looks at him quizzically
he just looks at her raising his eyebrows suggestively
rebecca watches stephen kiss sara her expression is tough to read
is she jealous
sara gets up and leaves
stephen goes to the stacks
stephen alone searches for a book among the remote stacks
the stacks are massive and endless row after row of them
stephen thumbs through books not finding the one he needs
he drops a book and bends down to pick it up
over his shoulder we see
rebeccas eyes in the space between the shelves
shes in the next aisle over
stephen replaces the book
he walks down the aisle looking at the numbers of the books
rebecca mimics his pacing as she follows him down her aisle
her hands gently brush against the books her eyes on stephen
he turns in her direction and stops in his tracks
so does rebecca
shes completely still
stephen walks over
he puts his hand on the book that covers rebecca
hes about to pull it out and reveal her
but its not the right one
he keeps walking
he reaches the end of his aisle
and rebecca the end of hers
shes right around the corner from him
he reads the markers at the end of the aisle trying to figure out which direction to go
rebeccas hands are sweaty
does she want to get caught
stephen turns right away from her and starts down the next aisle
rebecca softly exhales
and now whispers to herself
stephen stops dead
did he hear something
he keeps going scanning the book numbers again
shit wrong aisle
he doubles back and turns into rebeccas aisle
we hear a door close in the distance
stephen and sara walk on a tree lined path
he checks his watch
should we head back home
they walk by a small playground comprised of the slide jungle gym etc
the question is whose home
ill make you a bet
i go back to your place or you take me home to my twin bed and roommate
whats the bet
she eyes the jungle gym
sara and stephen are each hanging from the jungle gym
this has been going on for a few minutes
stephens worse off
this is kind of a stupid bet
whyd you agree
apparently im kind of a stupid guy
making me laugh isnt going to help you
they stare each other down
shes stifling a laugh much more in control as stephen is straining
he tries to swing his legs and kick her
she avoids him
he catches a peek at her bare midriff
finally this makes him fall
she then lets go victorious
i was a gymnast until i hit a growth spurt my freshman year
stephen brushes himself off
dejected that he was this close
she walks up to him
gives him a playful shove
so i win
he gives her a playful shove back
she seductively walks back towards him
takes his hand
lets go back to your place
she gives him a seductive grin
rebecca sketches in her bed
she looks at the clock a
and no sara
history is repeating itself
and rebeccas pissed
she rips out her sketch page and throws it away
she starts pacing the floor
she angrily moves saras chair back to her side
she whips out her phone and eyes the dial button
she starts to dial
but kills the call
she picks up her sketchpad again
suddenly a buzzing sound from saras desk
rebecca pulls out the desk drawer and finds saras cell phone
on the call screen a long beat
she pushes the talk button
but just listens
sara you answered
can we talk
rebeccas eyes clear
shes in control again
she sits down on saras bed tossing cuddles roughly to the floor
and now she lies down
i miss you
she moves her hand across her stomach
i want you jason
want you too
rebeccas hand moves toward her panties
i miss touching you
do you miss touching me
like you wouldnt believe
sara and stephen slam along the walls in a fever
kissing madly missing each others mouths
at his door
he cracks it open and peeks inside
his room is a disaster
definitely a new world record for empty beer cans pizza boxes and strewn clothes
just give me thirty seconds
but he slips into the room and closes the door behind him
sara leans back against the wall
flushed breathing hard
stephen is a whirlwind
he tosses everything beer cans clothes study papers into one big garbage bag
through the door im going to start taking my clothes off out here
hes not quite buying it
but hes cleaning faster
there goes my shirt
shes got his attention now
he speeds up
you know i dont believe you
wait goddamnit thats supposed to be my strip tease
there go the jeans
hes popping breath mints
while clearing off his bed
im just going to put your clothes back on and make you strip again
top or bottom
stephen stops and stares at the door
sara stands there fully dressed
she looks down the empty hallway
who do we have here
let me ask you
bra or panties
just calm down
the door swings open
stephen stands in front of her grinning
i knew you didnt have the guts
she flicks her bra at his face
he catches it shocked
he tosses it aside and yanks her into the room
the door slams shut behind them
rebecca is breathing harder and faster now
still holding the phone from which we hear jasons moans
say my name jason
until i tell you to stop
she puts the phone on speaker and lays it on the pillow beside her
both her hands ease back under the covers
rebecca writhes eyes closed
sara and stephen make out in bed half naked
he lies on top of her
looking into her eyes
sweet and intimate
rebecca writhes and moans
they moan together
louder and louder
and now they finish
a long beat
catching his breath jesus sara
that was incredible
i miss you so much
her smile dies
she picks up the phone
a cruel gleam in her eyes
dont ever call me again
she kills the call
and now deletes it from the phone log
carnegie dorm on a bright clear morning
sara hair mussed up but eyes shining
sara opens her door and steps in
shes tentative expecting rebecca to jump down her throat
but rebecca smiles
well good morning
sorry i didnt call
i forgot my phone
sara opens her desk drawer and grabs her phone
she quickly checks
rebecca looks sara over and smiles
dont i get any details
a nice girl doesnt kiss and tell
a nice easy vibe between them
you want to go get some breakfa before she can finish cuddles bolts out the door and down the hallway
sara chases after her as rebecca gets up from her bed
sara turns the corner to see
the resident assistant with cuddles cradled in her arms
sara apprehensively walks up to him
is this your cat sara
she nods as she gingerly takes cuddles from his arms
she turns to walk back to the room
and if you keep her i lose my job
do we understand each other
looks at him
sara walks back to her room
rebecca stands in the doorway
they exchange despondent looks
irene opens the door and sara walks in
what took you so long
its ten bucks for a cab and im a student
you cant just walk around downtown l
this is not des moines
seriously listen to me
thats why i own a gun
big cities are crawling with crazies
sara moves into the apartment
her phone rings
yeah im over at irenes
i meant to leave you a note
uh huh uh huh oh
thats a good idea
let me check hold on
sara covers the phone and turns to irene
do you like cats
we have to get rid of one
travel too much
poor thing would starve to death
back into phone no she cant
oh i dont know
whenever i get there
who was that
more than a little overprotective
thats no fun
so where is it
you said you had a surprise for me
i went through my closet
theres nothing here ive worn in the past six months
irene walks toward the couch where theres a pile of clothes
youre kidding all of these
we have no closet space at the dorms
rebeccas already using half of mine
oh my god i just had the best idea
why dont you move in here with me
yeah im never here
the place is huge
ditch the roommate
and the building allows pets
let me talk to rebecca about it
so hows jason
i really liked him
we broke up
sara stuffs her new clothes into her tiny closet
the bags spill out into the room taking up floor space
rebecca sits on her bed her laptop open
shes staring at irenes facebook profile
there are some racy pictures of irene and some girlfriends
irene gave them to me
she had a lot more but we dont have the room
too bad she couldnt take cuddles huh
well maybe thats not a problem
she actually suggested that i move in with her
you want to move
no of course not
i love living here
sara smiles as she sits down next to rebecca trying to put a bright spin on things
look id still technically be living here
so you wouldnt have to get a new roommate
her place is huge and its not like you couldnt use the extra closet space
id just move some of my stuff over and spend a few nights a week there
wed both have a lot more space
i dont want more space
she checks herself
a beat of awkward silence
nothings set in stone
its just something to think about
plus wed be able to keep cuddles
as sara hangs more new clothes in her closet rebecca stares across the room at
as sara crosses the quads she spots tracy up ahead walking by herself
tracy slows for a split second then keeps walking
as if she didnt hear anything
sara hurries to catch up with her
tracy smiles but weakly
the girls lost all her sparkle
her eyes dart around nervously like a birds
i heard you changed dorms
yeah conrad hall
seemed like a better vibe
well we should get together
like grab a bite or something
sara turns and waves at rebecca
rebecca starts to walk over to tracy and sara
ill call you
but shes already walking away
what was that about
i dont know
she just walked away
well shes always been a flake
sara whips up a latte for a customer her cell phone to her ear
shes really got the hang of this job now
in charge moving with a purpose
she snatches an issue of high times from her co workers hand and points him toward the sink
he starts washing blenders
i do so call mom
her latte customer rolls his eyes
he takes his drink and walks away
well actually i was thinking id do thanksgiving here and see you guys for christmas
she listens her face telling us that she doesnt like what shes hearing
ya know what im at work and im really getting slammed
there isnt another customer in sight
ill call you later okay
tell dad i said hello
she hangs up the phone and sighs
rebecca gathers her laundry into a giant duffle bag
as she carries it toward the door she passes cuddles curled up on saras bed
she scoops her up
looks like its just you and me tonight
rebecca walks downstairs down the hallway to the laundry room
rebecca waits for her clothes to finish drying
cuddles plays with a sock on top of a nearby washer
rebecca checks on her clothes
theyre dry with two minutes still left on the timer
she stuffs the clothes into her duffle bag
she walks to the washers and picks up cuddles
she pets her gently
she walks back to the dryer and places cuddles inside
see how nice and warm it is in there
cuddles seems to enjoy the warmth
rebecca closes the door and watches the confused kitten paw at the glass
she gently pushes the start button just enough to get the dryer moving for a sec
cuddles stumbles falls over and gets back up
rebecca pushes the button again a little longer this time
the dryer beeps
out of time
cuddles meows at rebecca wanting out
she reaches into her pocket
and pulls out her last quarter
she gently places it in the slot
on dryer display minutes
rebecca stares through the glass at the kitten
she fingers the button
before she pushes it sara walks in to find rebecca sprawled on her bed crying
she rushes over
hey whats wrong
rebecca looks up at her eyes red
cuddles got out
in the dorm
i was doing laundry
i took her with me
she jumped out of the bag and ran outside
i went after her but
im so sorry
sara stands pissed
she wants to really go off on rebecca
but the girls so distraught so fragile
maybe shell come back
im going to go find her
do you want me to help
but saras already gone slamming the door behind her
sara and rebecca sit alone at a table
just karma or something
we werent allowed to keep her anyway
youre not mad at me
it was an accident
stress after stress you know
is something else wrong
a beat as sara decides whether to confide
my parents really want me to come home for thanksgiving
you dont want to go
its not exactly the most festive holiday in the matthews household
emily died two days before thanksgiving
rebecca pats saras hand
i know i should be there with them but its like theres a ghost at the table
you can come with me
rebecca sits up her excitement growing
yeah spend thanksgiving at my house
your folks wouldnt mind
like theyd even notice
okay well see
professor roberts stands at the blackboard wrapping up a lecture
your midterm designs are due friday
remember class simplicity
who founded our industry
eve when she handed adam that fig leaf
students laugh on their way out the door
as sara walks past roberts
could i see you in my office please
ive got a class right now
but ill come right after it
sara knocks on professor roberts open door
she steps into his office
its small and intimate with books stacked along every wall
scraps of fabric are pinned to cork boards
roberts smiles at her from his chair
he walks to the door and closes it
he walks back pulls a chair close to hers and sits down
she crosses her legs her knees accidentally brushing against his
i dont think i need to tell you how impressed ive been with your work
every year i go to fashion week in paris
the photo shoots
that incredible runway
when the first model bursts through the curtain and hits that catwalk
sara a roar goes up from that crowd thats like
nothing youve ever heard
the college allows me to take one student
all expenses paid
full backstage access
usually its a senior
but it doesnt have to be
saras pulse is racing
im not sure i understand
are you saying what i think youre saying
im saying you have a shot
youd have to earn it sara
roberts stands and walks to the window
he looks out at the quad
and now turns back to sara
id like to see more danger in your work
your designs are always crisp theyre always clear
but theyre a little
sara cant keep the red from rising in her face
roberts walks over to her
dont be afraid to go to some of the
he delicately taps her temple
darker places in here
he squats beside her his hand on her shoulder now
he looks into her eyes
the best designers push the boundaries of whats
they take chances
do you like to take chances sara
so do i
he kisses her
sara pushes him away jumping out of her chair
she stands in front of him shaking
i cant believe you just did that
i took a chance thats all
with a student that i trust
i better go
sara grabs her books
as she heads for the door
dont blow the chance of a lifetime
she hurries out of the office
rebecca sits alone at a study table
sara walks up and drops down her books
students look over from other tables
sara doesnt care
she sits down and stares blankly into space trying to forget what just happened
rebecca leans over concerned
my design professor just kissed me
rebecca turns very serious
she gets up and sits down next to sara
are you alright
yeah it just really creeped me out
and i think the assholes married
rebecca puts her hand on saras
professor roberts at his desk set to call it a day
he tosses some design sheets into his briefcase
he opens a desk drawer
grabs his wedding ring
and slips it onto his finger
he hears footsteps in the hallway
the sexy unmistakable clicking of a womans heels
they come closer
and now stop at his door
roberts watches the door waiting for a knock
he walks to it
he can see the silhouette of two feet at the bottom of the door
he smiles sara coming back to him
he opens the door revealing rebecca
she wears a snug v neck cardigan skin tight black jeans and silver stiletto heels
a small purse on her shoulder
roberts swallows his surprise
im glad i caught you
actually i was just
but rebecca steps past him into the office her heels snapping on the worn hardwood floor
roberts a little annoyed but also intrigued follows her back inside
they face each other
youre not one of my students
thats why im here
she steps to his desk and leans against it
her cool manner is disarming
im failing intro pysch
and why is that
because im bored
i thought it would be all about freud and deep dark secrets
but its brain chemistry
i cant stay awake in class
im sorry to hear that
but im not sure what i can do to help
tomorrows the last day to drop a course without penalty
unless i can add another one in its place ill fall way behind in credits
daddy wont take that very well
he might even pull the plug
im pretty much at your mercy professor
this girl is a trip
is she for real
shes so calm so steady
roberts cant get a handle on her
look ive always made it a policy not to accept any students this late in the term
do i look like just any student to you
and eases up onto his desk
pretty feet dangling ankles locked
she eases her purse off her shoulder and onto the desk
she sees the framed picture of a woman and two kids
she picks it up
your wife is very pretty
the game is on now
roberts slowly walks around the desk until hes behind rebecca
in the picture frames reflection rebecca sees him slip off his wedding ring
he palms it
a few things id need to know
ask me anything
hes circling the desk now
predator and prey
do you have any design experience
what do you know about clothes
only one thing
and whats that
i definitely look better out of them than in them
what an answer
roberts stops in front of her
he moves in close between her parting legs
he looks into her eyes
i think we might be able to work something out
just tell me and ill do anything
ill take it from there
he kisses her
she opens her lips for a tantalizing second and now gently pushes him away
he holds his ground
hes had a taste he wants a lot more
suddenly rebeccas face hardens
youre hurting me
roberts stares at her in shock
hes not even touching her
whats going on
rebecca smiles again
this girl is whacked
but damn roberts wants her
and her eyes are inviting him back
as he presses in to kiss her again
she rockets a knee into his groin and he crumples to the floor gasping for air
he drops his wedding ring which rolls away across the floor
rebecca steps to the desk where her purse sits open
we can see the walkman inside
she takes it out
smiles at him
you should get one theyre great
she slips on the earbuds
plays with the walkman for a few seconds
and now hits the play button
we hear their prior conversation played back
just tell me and ill do anything
ill take it from there
owl youre hurting me
rage and betrayal in roberts eyes
you bitch tease
oh im not teasing
she starts to circle him now as he writhes in pain on the floor
do you see enough danger in me now professor
did i go to a dark enough place for you
he recognizes his own words to sara
who are you
he lunges at her ankle
she steps out of his grasp
and slams the sharp spike of her heel down on his hand
he yells again
she trusted you
she walks toward the door
please dont do this
everything i worked for
ill pay for that tape
rebecca stops at the door
she kneels picks up his wedding ring and rolls it across the floor to him
yes you will
she walks out the door
sara sits on stephens bed
she is looking out the window holding a theory book in her hand
stephen watches her from his side of the bed
sara is taken out of her own world what
are you ok
stephen smiles back
sara looks down in her book again
sara looks up at the building
she sighs before she enters
she walks slowly toward the classroom letting other students pass her
she steps into the doorway and sees
a woman standing at professor roberts podium
she gestures for everyone to come in
sara like the rest is confused
im professor jacobs
ill be taking over the class for the rest of the semester
sara cant believe it
she takes a seat and turns to the student next to her
sara walks in with a tray still a bit dazed
she sees a half dozen hallmates milling about and rebecca sitting by herself in the corner drawing
sara joins her
remember what i told you about professor roberts
what do you mean
well theyre calling it a leave of absence
but what i heard
someone sent the dean an anonymous recording of him hitting on another student
oh my god
thats called karma
sara serves up two fresh lattes
and now leans against the counter to watch the band
he catches her looking at him
stephen sweaty is behind the counter helping sara clean up
ive made a decision
lemme hear it
im gonna quit the band
its a waste of time and we suck
why would you say that
well let me think about this
the only places we can get booked is at my own frat house and at my girlfriends coffee shop
you guys do suck
did you just say girlfriend
you heard me
so you think itll be fun to stay here during thanksgiving
dinner at the frat the football games
dont forget the always awkward homoerotic humor
sounds like a blast
a somber rebecca stares at herself in the full length mirror on the back of the front door
a very strange expression in her eyes
she looks herself over makes a fist and now
punches herself on the temple
she staggers nearly knocked out
looks in the mirror
her skin is already bruising
she punches herself again
and again with her other fist this time
and now a shot to her shoulder
its painful to watch
but shes getting more and more numb to the blows
she inspects herself closely
and now reaches down and grabs an artists utility knife
it looks like a large retractable box cutter
she extends the blade all the way out
she pulls up her shirt
turns to the side a bit
places the knife against her skin and
sara opens the door and finds rebecca curled up in a fetal position in a corner of the room
sara drops her things and runs over to her
oh my god
she cradles rebecca who buries her head in between her knees
sara checks the bruises on her head and arms
youre safe now
talk to me
i was looking for cuddles
pulled me into an alley
sara holds her
she cant finish
i got away
youre alright now
sara notices a streak of blood against rebeccas shirt
she pulls it up and sees a slash
rebecca newly showered hair still wet sits on her bed in her underwear
sara is tending to her wounds
ice for the bruises
disinfectant for the cut
its not deep thank god
but you should see a doctor
rebecca you need to
and then the police
rebecca pulls back on her bed ruining the gauze job
i dont want to
sara pulls out her cell phone
youre calling them or i am
theres a psycho walking around this campus
i didnt see him
shes so frazzled shes undoing saras nursing efforts
i wont call
just let me help you
rebecca calms down
lets sara finish
watching her intently as she works
saras on the sidewalk in front of her dorm with stephen
inside the lobby is busy with students getting ready to go home for the holiday
sorry about not staying
i get it
im going to make out with my pillow and pretend its you
just say youll miss me
ill miss you
rebecca pulls up in her car
sara gets in
rebecca gives stephen an i win look as sara closes the door
sara looks down at her phone
i havent heard from jason in weeks
its weird how he just stopped calling
its what you wanted right
sara nods reassuring herself
yeah it is
sara looks out the window
rebecca shows a hint of a smile
rebeccas car pulls up to the iron gates of a huge mansion that could be straight out of lifestyles of the rich and famous
rebecca and sara stand in the driveway looking up at the mansion
sara is in shock
this is your home
its my parents house
it was never a home
rebecca and sara walk in
rebeccas on edge flinching as sara closes the door
rebeccas parents rush in from the living room
her father gives her an awkward hug
we didnt think you would make it
her mother sees the bruises on her face
this isnt nothing
leave it alone
sara is stunned
but rebeccas parents cease
her mom gives her a tender protracted embrace
rebecca endures it barely raising her arms
and you are
she puts out her hand but cuts rebecca a look
you didnt tell them
saras my roommate
rebeccas mother comes over and unexpectedly embraces sara
its so great to meet you sara
rebecca grabs sara by the arm
come on let me show you my room
rebecca slams the door behind them startling sara
you didnt tell them we were coming
they didnt need to know
rebecca plops down on the bed
sara looks around
its a typical teenage girls bedroom
except no posters
just drawings covering the walls
the drawings are of teenage girls more precisely theyre different drawings of one teenage girl
theyre odd but compelling
these are interesting
yeah some of my high school work
i havent gotten around to takin them down
family and guest sit around a very nice but not too large dining table
the contents of the house are expensive but not pretentious
rebecca plays with her food clearly not wanting to engage her parents who are undaunted
all smiles and warmth
rebeccas a pretty great artist
yeah we think rebecca is so talented
rebecca shakes her head uncomfortable with the flattery
shes an awesome roommate too
looks at his daughter thats nice to hear and im sure she likes you because she never brings anyone home before
rebecca stares at her father
as a parent you worry
you protect your daughter all her life and then she goes off to college and shes on her own
im just relieved she got a good roommate
sara cuts discreet looks around the table
who are these people
sara ill make up a room for you shell stay in my room
sara turns to rebecca confused but willing to go along
sara and rebecca are getting ready to sleep
sara has made a makeshift bed in the middle of the floor
we can share the bed if you want
sara looks down at her own bed and takes a glance at the walls
on the floor shes going to be surrounded by the drawings of rebecca looking at her
sara climbs into bed with rebecca
they lay back to back
rebecca turns the lamp off next to the bed
thanks for coming
next thanksgiving you can run interference with my family
sara closes her eyes
rebecca turns over
she opens her eyes just inches from sara
she ever so slowly raises her hand and gently strokes saras hair
sara opens her eyes for a second
not sure if she felt something
she closes them again
jeff walks from the stairs into the pitch black kitchen
hes lived here long enough to know his way in the dark
jeff opens the fridge
the soft light barely illuminates rebecca sitting stoically at the table behind her father
he recovers standing by the open fridge
you scared me
rebecca glass of milk in her hand gives her father a dirty look
we know how much she hates nicknames
sara wakes up alone in bed
she can hear soft voices from downstairs
she climbs out of bed and walks to the door
sara stands at the top of the stairs
she walks down them and to the kitchen doorway
she peeks inside to see
rebecca and her father sitting at the table
just the moonlight through the window falling over them
howre you doing
my grades are good
thats not what i meant
she looks down at the table
im making friends
jeff very subtly cringes
a long beat
rebecca look at me for a second
now she looks at him
your mother and i are very fond of you
he doesnt know what else to say
outside sara sees the framed photos on the wall
each features rebeccas parents in some exotic locale on the beach
on the ski slopes
on a cruise ship
they smile happily at the camera
rebecca isnt in a single picture
i just wanted to make sure
good night im heading back to bed
sara turns and walks up the stairs
sara waits by the front door
alison walks in
rebeccas going to show me some of her high school hangouts
alison peers up the stairs
rebecca seems to be doing well
i think she is
is she taking her medication
alison turns to see
her daughter at the top of the stairs
did she hear them
she walks down
she kisses her on the cheek
rebecca is annoyed
sara nods but shes still reeling from alisons words
she looks back but alison waves cheerfully
have a great time you two
its an affluent but quaint little towns main street
rebecca and sara stroll down the sidewalk
sara cuts discreet sideways glances at rebecca
is everything okay
she wants to ask her about that medication
nice to see where you come from
sara and rebecca are in line for their drinks
the teenage cashier takes their money
but keeps staring at rebecca
she doesnt pay any attention to him
sara takes her coffee
the cashier stares at her as if trying to figure sara out
whats she doing with rebecca
the girls sit at a table
the cashier and barista keep glancing over whispering to each other
rebecca shoots them a look
like a warning
start doing busy work
i used to come here like every day after school
the door opens
three girls walk in laughing and chatting
one brunette spots rebecca and stops dead in her tracks
sara recognizes her
its maria the girl from rebeccas facebook and the subject of all those wall sketches
the chatting girls all fall silent
you know them
they went to my high school
rebecca doesnt answer her
shes focused on making eye contact with the brunette
the girls linger by the door whispering among themselves
finally the brunette sits down at a table by the entrance
as far away from rebeccas and saras table as possible
the other two girls walk to the counter
they sneak glances at rebecca as they order their drinks
sara looks back and forth between rebecca and the girls
rebecca doesnt waver
she keeps staring at the brunette
suddenly rebecca gets up
rebecca walks towards the door
sara confused gathers her things and gets up
rebecca stops at the brunettes table
the brunette sits there like a deer caught in headlights
the other girls walk over
rebecca unfazed looks them over sending shivers down their spines
they want to back up their friend but they look as scared as she does
sara watches all this from a few feet away
rebecca suddenly turns cheerful
oh i wanted to introduce you to sara
sara gives a small wave to maria who looks her over
almost as if she feels sorry for her
rebecca keeps eyeing maria a superior grin on her face
an awkward beat
sara clears her throat
well we better go
rebecca snaps out of it
they start to walk out
but as they open the door
everyone turns to maria
she looks rebecca in the eye
we were never friends
rebecca stares at her grinding her teeth
the tension building
maria doesnt back down though
she needed to say this
sara grabs rebeccas shoulder gently
come on lets go
headed back to school
sara looks out the window
lost in thought
i guess college is a fresh start for both of us
rebecca doesnt look at her
just a hint of acknowledgement on her face
saras phone buzzes
this gets rebeccas attention
sara looks at the text message she just received from irene back in la
lemme know abt movin in
irenes back in town
sara types and sends a text back
rebecca watches her
saras running through the quad
sara coming in from a run times it perfectly sneaking in the front door as a student walks out
she bypasses the elevator heading straight to the stairs
she bursts out the door and into the hallway
she walks in still a bit out of breath
rebecca is packing her back pack
not looking up good run
between deep breaths great
you wanna go get dinner
im going to the art studio
catch you later then
dont wait up sara
i feel inspired
shes out the door
sara notices that rebecca left her sketchpad behind on her bed
she eyes it for a beat
looks at the closed door
as she steps toward the sketchpad
rebecca charges back in
forgot my pad
she snags it from her bed and leaves
sara eyes rebeccas dresser
she walks to the door and opens it
sara peeks her head out and looks down both sides of the empty hallway
she hears the elevator ding
sara heads straight for rebeccas dresser
is she really going to do this
she slides open the top drawer supplies
the second drawer sketchpads
she leafs through them empty
she searches the third drawer sweaters
she feels around beneath them
wait a minute
she pulls out two bottles of prescription medicine
both bottles are full of pills
as sara stares at them
she leaps out of her socks
but its just stephen
your door was open
oh my god
sara grabs him and gives him a long hug
stephen holds her tight and speaks muffled by her neck
what are those
should she bring him into this
thats what i intend to find out
rebecca is standing up back pack around her shoulder her drawing pad in her other hand
her arm is wrapped around a pole for balance
she stares out the window
she looks like shes staring at her own reflection
the train comes to a halt
riders shuffle around
rebecca sees a seat open up and sits down
she opens her drawing pad and starts on a blank piece of paper
she looks up and we see what shes been staring at irene
sara and stephen stand at saras desk over her computer
sara googles lithium and apd and clicks on an entry
apd anti social personality disorder
also known as sociopathy
they look at each other
i thought she was just weird
it says lithium can control the condition
nodding at the bottles maybe these are refills
maybe shes been taking it all along
certainly doesnt seem like shes been taking them
hes right and she knows it
i think its time i moved in with irene
a stylish hip night club
a sophisticated crowd
irene and three friends sit in the lounge section sipping exotic martinis and watching the dance floor
and on that dance floor one particular woman dances by herself lost in the music oblivious to everything around her
she turns as she dances and we see that its rebecca
irene gets up and heads towards the bathroom
as she winds her away around the borders of the dance floor she notices rebecca
she pauses to watch her
their eyes meet for more irene stands at the mirror fixing her make up
the door opens and closes
she glances over to see rebecca walking in
rebecca steps to the sink just a few feet down from irene
shes out of breath a sexy sheen of sweat on her arms
irene breaks out a tube of lip gloss
rebecca is watching her in the mirror and irene knows it
she applies the gloss and smiles at the little kick it gives her
her eyes find rebeccas in the mirror
im sorry to stare but you are so beautiful
so are you
what kind is it
a girl never knows how late shes gonna party
can i try it
irene hands her the lip gloss
rebecca takes her hand and pulls her close
she kisses irene full on the lips
this rooms heating up fast
irenes eyes meet rebeccas
why dont we get out of here
id invite you to my place but i have a roommate
as luck would have it im only two blocks away and
what are we waiting for
an alarm clock buzzes with no effect to irene who is dead to the world
she grunts and finally opens her eyes
she wipes the sleep from her eyes she looks around confused looks to the empty side of her bed where someone had obviously spent the night
irene sits up and turns off the alarm
she looks at an empty glass on her bedside table
irene gets up with the empty glass in her hand
she stumbles out into the
she staggers to keep her balance on her way to the kitchen
we stay in the hallway as irene enters in the kitchen and switches on the light
we can see her shadow in the hallway and hear irene fill her glass
its quiet for a moment
she fills the glass again
irene comes back into the hallway with glass in hand
she switches off the light in the kitchen
but as she starts to go back to her room
rebecca charges out of nowhere and crashes into irene
sara is going for a run through the city
she stops at an old art deco apartment building
sara spots irenes name on the buzzer and calls up
she walks out the door
and takes off running again
sara hands on hips walks down the hallway and opens the door
she finds rebecca sitting on her bed
she lights up when she sees sara
where were you all night
oh i got inspired
i just lost track of time
sara pulls off her sweaty top and throws it in the hamper grabbing a towel
shes wearing a sportsbra revealing her tattoo
sara grabs a robe
shes nervous but she needs to do this
time for the big talk
she sits on her bed and faces rebecca
i want a tattoo
will you come with me
it would mean a lot to me
i wont be able to do it without you
sara looks into her plaintive eyes
so much want in them
the girls walk along the wall checking out the samples
you cant rush this rebecca
we can always come back
i know what i want
im out here if you need me
sara sits down as the tattoo artist escorts rebecca upstairs
she looks giddy and nervous
when shes gone sara takes out her phone and texts irene
sara bored leafs through a tattoo magazine for the th time
her phone buzzes
a response from irene outta town for a gig
will call when back saras relieved
rebecca walks slowly down the stairs
wincing in pain
sara puts the phone back in her pocket and stands up
lets see it
rebecca pulls down the collar of her shirt to reveal just under her collarbone sara stunned speechless starts backing away from her
think of me as your sister
rebecca is oblivious to the rage building in sara
if you want
you can call me emily
sara clenches her fists
shes shaking with rage
she moves toward rebecca whose grin fades
whats the matter
sara steps up to her inches away ready to beat the shit out of her
and rebecca cant believe it
shes that far gone
her eyes search saras for an answer
sara abruptly turns and walks out the door
rebecca watches her leave through the front window
sara never looks back
the elevator doors open
sara emotionally exhausted steps out carrying a box of her things
stephen waits by the door
this is all youre taking
ill get the rest of my things when irene comes back to town
he takes the box
then notices wheres your necklace
she instinctively rubs the base of her neck
i cant find it
im not going back up there
he hands her the box
time to man up
ill go look for it
she kisses him tenderly unbelievably appreciative
sara walks out to the cab
shes tempted to look back at her dorm room window
but she doesnt
good thing too
rebecca sits on the ledge looking down
her face is blank
not hurt not angry completely blank
rebecca still sits at the window
she holds her camera up taking a picture down below
she turns as stephen enters
she puts the camera down
have you seen saras necklace
rebecca solemnly shakes her head
he looks around the dresser
in the drawers
flips over saras pillow
rebecca watches him
what did i do
he stops searching
looks at her
she just needs to move on
he doesnt answer
he keeps searching
but he can feel rebeccas eyes on him now
he gives up
if you do find it can you let me know
instead of answering rebecca raises her camera and takes his picture
stephen stares at her unnerved
he finally snaps out of it and walks out the door
she watches him go
sara is cleaning trying to make a dent in a world class mess
she doesnt mind a big weights off her shoulders
you should call someone
the deans office
or at least your r
she keeps cleaning
and tell them what
what has she really done to me
no one can do anything
its the weirdest thing stephen
the girls own parents are afraid of her
well she sure scared the shit out of me
sara really wants to change the subject
she holds up two of his t shirts
are these dirty or clean
stephen sniffs the shirts
somewhere in between
she throws the t shirts at him
sara heads to class walking faster than usual
bumping into people as she looks around making sure shell spot rebecca before rebecca spots her
she makes it to the front door of the building
she looks back at the quads
sara locks the front door and heads back home
she walks down an empty quad
she slows at the sight of
walking directly towards her from the other end of the quad
no one else is in sight
sara thinks about veering off to the side
she can do this
she walks straight ahead
rebecca keeps her pace hooded sweater up looking down at the pavement listening to her walkman
sara takes a deep breath as they get closer to each other preparing herself for the confrontation
ten feet away now
but rebecca passes her without looking
sara walks a little further and turns around
rebecca keeps walking
did she even see her
sara hurries up the stairs to the fraternity house
sara reaches psi u
and closes the door behind her
she looks around at the messy first floor
at the pack of guys in the living room yelling at the hoops game on tv
rebecca is alone with just a crack of light coming from the open door to the hallway
shes sketching still wearing her walkman
hundreds of sheets of paper are scattered around the floor but we cant see what shes drawing
sara is trying to study at a cramped desk but the music from outside the room is too loud
stephen is on the bed reading
hes used to it
she hears a loud commotion from the hallway
frustrated she gets up
its a couple of guys playing nerf basketball
is it a game to be as loud as you possibly can
she waves her arms like a crazy person
how many walls can you possibly bump into
they just return blank stares
she slams the door shut
sara tries to study while the fraternity brothers continue to shout down the hall
stephen eyes her warily
her cellphone rings
she pulls it out of the purse jason
and now stuffs the phone back in her bag as she gets up from the table
hey im going to hit the library
i can walk you there
no its okay
party starts at ten
really cool band
i hear the drummers really hot
he may be but im sleeping with his girlfriend
she kisses him
jason a handsome all american midwestern kid stands in front of saras dorm
hes talking into his cell phone
im in front of your dorm
i just flew in
im at the roosevelt hotel room
call me okay
he hangs up
some students leave the dorm and he grabs the door before it closes
rebecca kneels down in front of her dresser
opens the bottom drawer
she fishes underneath them
pulls out her lithium pills
but just looks at them
anger in her eyes
she puts the bottle back
jason walks through the hallway checking the numbers on the doors
he stops in front of saras room
knocks lightly on the door
rebecca sits back into saras chair staring at the door ignoring the knocks
her right hand slowly drags a utility knife over the armrest shredding it to pieces
jason writes a note
he folds it and slides it under the door
he hesitates for a second hoping this is the right thing to do then walks back down the hallway towards the elevator
rebecca stares at the note for a moment
she walks to the door picks it up and begins to read jasons note
i know you wont take my calls but im here and i just want to see you
im at the roosevelt hotel room until
however long it takes
love rebecca crumples up the paper and throws it in the trash
rebecca lets the water soak her
she runs her fingers through her now long dark brown hair
black water trickles down her legs and puddles near the drain
rebecca stands naked in front of the mirror staring at her reflection
she then digs into her bag and pulls out a long pair of shears
her emily tattoo is starting to heal
she gently traces the letters with the sharp tips of the shears still looking at it in the mirror
she lifts the shears and starts cutting her hair shorter
just above her shoulders
rebecca walks over to saras closet
she opens it and thumbs through some of the clothes that sara left behind
she pulls out a dress
holds it in front of herself as she stands in front of the mirror
nice but somethings missing
rebecca goes to her drawer and pulls out saras silver chain
which she caresses in her hand
saras kicked her feet on the table reading a book
enjoying the silence
a raucous party in full swing
stephens band has just finished playing and hes walking off the cheap stage
a hot girl smiles at him
help me find the keg
sure i have to go look for my girlfriend anyway
she walks away
and now checks his watch
the elevator door opens revealing rebecca
or is it sara
rebecca looks just like her
as she steps into the hallway she gently fingers the necklace
she walks along looking at the room numbers
she stops in front of a room
shes about to knock
but she sees a housekeeping cart a few doors down in front of an open room
she walks to the cart
she peeks inside the room
and now plucks the master key card off the cart
jason shirtless sleeps on his stomach in bed
the front door clicks and slowly creaks open just enough for a silhouette of a woman to appear
she closes the door
jason barely acknowledges the noise in his sleep
rebecca walks to the bed in the soft moonlight
she stares down at jason
she slips off her dress which falls to the floor
shes in just bra and panties now
she climbs onto the bed beside jason
he starts awake
she crawls onto him not letting him turn over
she starts kissing the back of his neck
you got my voicemail
kissing his back now moving lower
oh man sara
oh that feels good
she works her way back up to his ear
did that sound like sara
but as jason turns over he sees
that unmistakable emily tattoo
close your eyes
she reaches beneath the blanket and does what she needs to
she settles onto him
and now starts to move
and as she moves we go behind her and see shining in the low light the utility knife beneath her bra strap
flat against the skin of her back
jason lies still eyes clenched shut
i love you sara
she lets him have one two three seconds of heaven
her hands reach behind her and ease out the utility knife
but she doesnt love you
jasons eyes fly open
that wasnt saras voice
and those arent saras eyes boring into his
rebecca leans down her face to his
jasons eyes widen in shock horror and now pain as her unseen hands drive the knife deep into his gut
you hurt her
she kisses him the last thing hell ever feel
he shudders trembles and lies still eyes open
saras still reading
a hand touches her shoulder
she jumps but its just the librarian
were about to close
sara cant believe its so late
she puts her things away
grabs her phone to check the time distracted by the new voicemail message
shes about to press the voicemail button
but a text comes in from irene
get your butt over here ive got another surprise for you
stephen walks around beer less searching the crowd for sara
he checks his watch
pats his pocket no cell phone
he heads up the stairs and into his room
stephen picks his phone off the dresser
sees he has a new voicemail from sara
he plays the message hi stephen its me
im stopping by irenes come on by
i want you guys to meet
its on south grand apt
a sharp knock and the bedroom door opens
all hands on deck the kegs still alive
sara comes fast paced down the sidewalk
she enters irenes building
sara rides up the elevator
sara walks to the door of irenes apartment
its open but theres not a sound
no music no cocktail chatter
she checks the apartment number again
its the right one
she knocks lightly
sara steps into the foyer
she walks down the long entryway into a newly renovated living room
dark and empty
saras starting to feel uneasy
theres a bedroom dead ahead
warm light pours out
she slowly walks to the open door
close on saras eyes
horror stricken by what she sees
the bedroom is dark except for the single lamp above
she lies on the bed each of her wrists cuffed to a bedpost
a red hermes scarf is stuffed in her mouth
sara cant move
she stares at irene in shock
irene mumbles her eyes wide open in terror
as sara starts toward irene
some role model she turned out to be
couldnt even take care of herself
rebecca steps out of the darkness a gun in her hand
sara drops her phone on the floor
rebecca holds the gun steady on sara
sit down and shut up
sara lowers herself into a black chair her eyes on irene
rebecca picks up saras cell phone
listen to me
all i ever wanted was to be your friend
sara knows she has to play this just right
rebecca you are my friend
were not friends
were here because you betrayed me
rebecca im sorry stop it
stop saying things you dont mean
i protected you
from that whore tracy and that nasty little kitten
and that scumbag of a professor
even that loser ex boyfriend of yours
whatre you talking about
whatd you do to them
whatd you do to jason
i got rid of them all
and how do you repay me
by leaving me
sara sinks out of the chair onto her knees in astonishment
she looks at irene
sara digs deep
lifts up her face
and looks rebecca in the eye
she puts everything she has into this
rebecca please forgive me
a long beat
rebeccas face lights up
now we can start all over again
lets make things the way they were sara
that first day
just the two of us
sara sees rebecca start to twist a garbage bag in her hands
you can only have one best friend
rebecca whips the bag around irenes head
irene starts to buck and thrash
but it doesnt help her
lay still bitch
dont do this
she stares at irene
she cant watch her die
she walks toward the bed ignoring rebeccas gun
i mean it
rebecca raises the gun to saras face but sara keeps coming
rebecca realizes she cant stop sara
she cracks sara across the temple with the gun butt knocking her to the floor
she kneels down beside sara
clearing the hair from saras face
im so sorry
sara backhands her knocking the gun out of her hand
it skitters across the floor and out the door into the living room
sara stands up first and dives for the bed but rebecca grabs sara by the neck and rips her off the bed
she puts her in a chokehold
sara backs rebecca into the wall trying to loosen the chokehold
she slams her back against the wall
sara smashes her elbow into rebeccas jaw breaking her grip
she heads for the door but rebecca trips her
as sara rises
rebecca knees her in her stomach knocking the wind out of her
as sara gasps for breath
rebecca races out into the living room for the gun
sara gets up quickly and slams the door shut and locks it
rebecca turns around and goes for the door
sara goes to the bed and rips open the garbage bag on irenes head
irenes eyes pop open
huge relief in saras face
rebecca bangs the door
dont do this sara
sara takes the scarf out of irenes mouth and pulls against the steel handcuffs
rebecca wipes blood off her lip and leans up to the door
dont make me hurt you sara
i just want to be your friend
sara and irene are frantic
she nods her head and sara sees the phone on the bed table
she rushes for it
no good the wire is cut
theres a fire escape
you can reach it
rebecca looks around for the gun
throwing chairs and furniture around
she finds it
picks the gun off the floor
sara races to the window and throws it open
theres just an empty street below
she eyes the fire escape
a nearly impossible leap away
but saras out of options
sara takes a tentative step out onto the slim ledge
her foot hits a flowerpot which plummets ten stories
and smashes to pieces in the alley
sara shuts her eyes
rebecca back at the bedroom door raises the gun and fires
the door shatters and the bullet continues straight ahead and tears a pillow open just beside irenes head
feathers go flying
rebecca kicks the door open and steps in gun in hand
i know youre scared sara
but i promise everything is gonna be okay
she stops short at the sight of
sara on the ledge
rebecca turns and stares at irene
fresh panic rising in irenes eyes
but shes my friend not yours
she raises the gun at the helpless irene
but out of nowhere stephen rushing up from behind knocks her arm
the gun fires wildly one bullet
exploding through the window shattering it and startling sara who loses her balance and slips off the ledge
she grabs on by her fingertips her face hitting the brick wall
the more she screams the more she loses her grip
rebecca fires another shot hitting a giant bedroom mirror shattering its reflection of rebeccas struggle with stephen
rebecca slams her head into his lip knocking him backward
he keeps hold of her and they hit the floor the gun flying out of rebeccas hand
stephen gets on top
he lifts his arm high and balls his fist before he puts it right in her face full throttle knocking her out cold
he quickly takes the gun and puts it inside his belt as he races for the window
he sees sara dangling outside and reaches for her
saras crying barely mouthing stephens name
he grabs her arms
leaning halfway outside he starts to pull her up
part of the way up he holds her against his chest and lets her cry
okay ive got you
everything is gonna be okay
he pulls her halfway in the window
but a shadow rises behind him
a loud unpleasant sound
then stephen stiffens his body straightening in shock
and now sara stares in horror as
blood runs down his face
he looks into saras eyes
and lets go of her
she falls but manages to hook onto the ledge as stephen disappears from the window frame
using the brick wall for leverage she arduously lifts herself up into the window in time to see
stephen glassy eyed backing away from the window
he slumps to the floor revealing rebecca
shes a crazed mess hair and eyes wild
rebecca drops the bloody fireplace poker and rushes to the window
she helps sara in
they tumble onto the floor
sara tosses rebecca to the side and rushes over to stephen
stephen is out
she sees the gun in his belt
she pulls it out spins and levels it at rebecca
the gun shakes violently in her hand
rebecca stands and walks calmly towards sara who is still on the floor
you wont do it
were fr sara pulls the trigger
rebecca stares in shock
sara closes her eyes in frustration
she drops the gun
tears stream down rebeccas face
she cant believe sara pulled that trigger
but as if flipping a switch
rebeccas sadness turns to rage
she balls her fists her knuckles white and
charges at sara full force slamming her against the wall
she tosses her like a ragdoll across the room where
saras head slams the nightstand knocking the contents of rebeccas purse everywhere
rebecca wipes the tears from her eyes
it hurts her to hurt sara
friends help each other
they take care of each other
sara dazed and weak stares at rebecca
we were never friends
thats the last straw
rebecca comes hard murder in her eyes
she grabs sara around the throat pulls her up from the floor and slams her against the wall
she starts choking the life out of her
saras face turns red
but suddenly rebeccas grip loosens
her eyes stare in shock
sara pulls rebeccas hands off her neck with one hand
the utility knife is in her other hand
stuck between rebeccas shoulder blades
rebecca falls to the floor bringing sara down with her
she wont let go of sara
as she gasps for air she sees
saras tattoo visible beneath her torn shirt
sara self consciously notices her looking at it
rebecca reaches out and grabs saras hand
sara lets go of her hand and removes the necklace from around rebeccas neck
irene is trembling in the bed
too shocked to say anything
she races over to him
hes barely alive
she finds her phone on the floor
she steps back to stephen and cradles his head in her lap as she dials
he looks into her eyes and smiles
she smiles through her tears love in her eyes
its a warm spring day
sara melancholy but looking in much better shape since the last time we saw her stands in front of her dorm looking to restart her college career
she plays with the silver chain once again around her neck
she opens the front door and walks in
students milling about look at her
know who she is
we see kim and tracy
they dont say anything
dont know what to say
sara opens the door
the simple room is identical to her previous one
she hesitates at first but then walks in
there is a box marked sara filled with the things she left behind in her old dorm
theres a knock on the open door
how are you feeling
stephen enters the room
you being heres gonna help
hows moving in going
just got here
well let me give you some time to get settled in
actually i need you right here right now
he likes where this is headed
sara and stephen push the twin bed into the hallway
this isnt exactly what i had in mind
now i can get settled in
ill be back to pick you up for dinner
you gonna be ready
stephen takes off down the hall
sara follows him with her eyes before she goes back into her room
sara sits down on her bed
she watches the empty space where the other bed used to be
she just stares at it
the camera slowly tracks sideways until we see the side of the bookshelf where unseen by sara theres a flyer hung with a picture of richard princes nurse of greenmeadow
announcing an upcoming gallery exhibition
