written by david koepp based on the novel richard matheson march sometimes within the brains old ghostly house i hear far off at some forgotten door a music and an
eerie faint carouse and stir of echoes down the creaking floor
chambers of imagery archibald macleish in the black a child hums
gentle water sounds
jake a four year old boy sits in a bathtub
the door to thi bathroom is open and his mother is visible in the background walking back and forth in the bedroom getting dressed to go out
the stereo is blaring in the bedroom the music echoes off the tile in the tiny bathroom
jake is playing with a plastic airplane
he answers a question
with my toys
he looks up but were close in on him and cant see who hes looking at
jake contd my
the one with the gray tape around the middle
he lands the airplane on the water
jake coast d thats silly
from the bedroom jake
you all right in there
calling out to the door the airplane takes off again
jake lowers his voice to a whisper
jake contd what
my daddy but he doesnt know about it yet
he brings the airplane in for a careful water landing and lets go of it
he looks up
jake cont d can i ask you a question
he pauses looks to the door to make sure his mother isnt too close
moving back now we see that jake is all alone in the bathroom staring at the empty bathtub across from him
jake contd does it hurt to be dead
the toy airplane sinks and crash lands on the bottom of the tub
maggie witzky twenty six or seven jakes mom city girl knows how to take care of herself pokes her head in the doorway buttoning up her blouse
who you talkin to jake
he turns to her and whispers
its a secret
tom witzky maggies age lean and muscled like somebody who works for a living lies on jakes bed next to his son reading him a story
jake is nearly asleep
well i was walking in the night and i saw nothing scary
for i have never been afraid of anything
i was deep within the woods when suddenly i spied them
i saw a pair of pale green pants with nobody inside them
i wasnt scared
but yet i stopped
what could those pants be there for
what could a pair of pants at night be standing in the air for
maggie leans in the doorway and whispers
is he asleep
my brothers here
tom looks at jake who is asleep
tom closes the book turns off the light and covers his son
he kisses him on the forehead
tom goes to a dresser and turns on the baby monitor the transmitter
its red light glows
after tom leaves jake opens his eyes and stares
the chicago skyline looms over the street they live on
not the suburbs but not quite downtown either
two story brick houses jammed side by side barely room for a raised voice across the narrow driveways
bar on the corner neon sign bernies tap
a homeless guy rants his way down the opposite sidewalk
tom maggie and philip early twenties come out of the house and head down the steps
tom carries the baby monitor the receiver in one hand
jakes breathing is clearly audible on the speaker
toms on the sidewalk
maggie still three steps up stops and puts her arms wide
tom turns around and maggie lets herself go falling straight forward
tom catches her on his back and carries her piggy back
she leans around and bites his ear
what are the odds of a single woman being at this thing
bout a million to one
any hot mommies
how big you like em
the hot engine of a yellow trans am fires up in the driveway of the house across the street
it backs into the street its passenger door hanging open
the driver honks the horn and a seventeen year old kid runs out of another house and jumps into the moving vehicle
they take off
the homeless guy berates them shaking his fist
they reach the steps of the house next door
party noise comes from within shadows move in the windows
tom swings maggie around puts her on the step wraps his arms around her and kisses her
it goes on
excuse me hello i enjoy soft core as much as the next guy but this is almost like incest for me
still kissing tom should we tell him
get the fuck outta here
he grabs maggie and hugs her
tom starts up the steps
philip cont d look at this i havent even had a second date in a year and a half you guys are on your second kid
philip catches up to tom and throws his arms around him
philip cont d you big huggable bear
youre still goin back to school though right

i dont know i just found out about this
im telling you if you never go back to college youll regret it for the rest of your life
the memories i have of being a freshman those were three of the happiest years of my life
twenty or thirty people are crowded into a living room
its loud smoky theres music and a ton of booze empty beer bottles five gallon jugs of wine big liter bottles of vodka and gin
the men are mostly on one side women on the other
as maggie heads toward the women tom grabs her arm and pulls her back close
seven years and ive still never been to a party where you werent the one i wanted to hang with
she smiles melted and they part
tom joins the men
bobby vanessas husband an athletic looking guy holding a sleeping three year old on his shoulder talks with frank mccarthy fortyish big irish drinker and harry damon who is also
older than the rest
tom tom tommy how are ya
he shoves a beer into toms hand
alive on the planet

noise and wandered in but to actually invite him into your home

philip surveys the selection of females
he sees vanessa late twenties hasnt lost the weight from the last baby yet not attracted to
sheila a thin nervous woman around franks age philip cont d not drunk enough for

philip cont d frightened by
everyone has eaten some have left the ones that remain are bombed
a drunk couple dances dirty
frank stares long and hard at someones cleavage
sheila the nervous woman stares at frank pissed off
he looks at her gives her a what
must be married to each other
tom on the other side of the room hears a shriek of womens voice and turns
he sees maggie blushing receiving hugs and congrltulations from the two or three women around her
vanessa talks to maggie while she mixes up a blender of margaritas
the room is jammed with people
how did you and tom meet
he saved my life
the summer i was nineteen i was at jones beach i swam out too far and got a cramp in my leg
there was no way i was gonna make it back
i was goin down i was swallowing water and everything
tom was a lifeguard
i dont know what he was doing out that far he said he just had a feeling
oh my god did you have sex with him like that night
he said im his slave until i saved him back
thats so romantic
bobby and i met when i peed in the guys john at a bon jovi concert
she hits puree on the blender
the partys down to the hard core half dozen who are passing a joint
tom sits on the couch feet on the coffee table next to their baby monitor
maggie is next to him frank and sheila are jammed in there too
bobby and vanessa sit on the floor opposite
philip is in a chair at the end
p ople who say they were hypnotized werent really they were just you kn w playing along
then how could they have needles stuck into their throats without bleeding
without even making a sound

she clutches her arms around her breasts as she says that
you get the feeling shed like to expose herself

we promise not to make you do a strip tease on the kitchen table
sheila glares at him

hey frank youre the one whos so curious why dont you no
ah thats different
whaddya got to hide

tom sits forward
what the hell
ill try anything once
a hand switches off the lamp on the table
another hand turns off the lamp in the corner
the music is turned off
tom sits in the armchair in the n arly darkened room
philip shoves the coffee table back and sits on it directly in front of him
the others crowd around expectantly silent
from anyone please
any distraction can break it up
he raises his index finger and holds it about a foot in front of toms face
philip cont d okay

damn fine lookin finger
they do look at it
keep looking at it
dont look at anything else just my finger
can you clean out the nail its kinda makin me sick here
philip raises two fingers and jabs tom in the eyes
tom cont d hey what the fuck

well ive seen it done a dozen times
try not to screw him up permanently
to tom you want to be hypnotized
i want to be hypnotized
i want to be fuckin hypnotized already
close your eyes
as tom does our eyes close too big heavy lashes dropping over everything and plunging us into blackness
just listen for a moment
we can still hear the sounds of the living room
ice clinks in a glass as someone drinks
a car hums by outside
now look at the backs of your eyelids
do you see anything there
out of the pitch black we can detect tiny images
focus on it
a small squiggly line comes into focus drifting up through the black then bouncing suddenly downward
i want you to pretend youre in a theatre
were sitting in a theatre a bare stage at the front
a movie theatre
okay were sitting in a movie theatre
its crowded with people waiting for the movie to start
youre the only one there
the people disappear
the theatre is empty
youre sitting near the front
we pop up ten rows closer to the screen
the walls of the theatre are black covered with black velvet
black velvet descends over the walls
the seats are covered with black velvet
black velvet crawls over the seats
there is no light in the theatre
the lights click off
in the whole pitch black theatre theres only one thing you can see
the white screen
you drift toward it in your chair
up ahead of us the screen is a dazzling white
we move slowly toward it floating over the seats
there are letters up on the screen
tall thick black letters but theyre out of focus
you drift closer to them trying to read them
blurry black letters appear on the screen
we drift closer
youre comfortable in your black velvet seat very comfortable
you just sit there looking at the screen drifting closer in your chair staring at those letters on the screen
your feet and ankles are relaxed
your legs are relaxed
your hands are limp and heavy
your arms are relaxed
the letters come into focus youre close enough now you can read them
the letters are right in front of us now but still blurry
the letters spell
the moment he speaks the word five giant black letters come into focus on the white screen filling our entire field of vision
we stare at that word for a moment and then everything goes black
no sound no image no nothing
six faces stare right at us from up close
tom is in the chair eyes open looking disoriented
didnt work huh
all six faces burst out laughing a great nervous tension released
somebody turns the lights back on somebody else hits the music
tom cont d what
philip seems very pleased with himself
maggie comes and sits on the arm of the chair next to tom puts her hand on his face
are you okay
did somethin happen
people start talking all at once
you were faking it
you had to be faking it
what are you talking about
that was the weirdest thing ive ever seen in my whole fuckin life
how do you feel
how am i supposed to feel
everybojy laughs again
tom wipes his forehead
hes covered with sweat
he gets up
he doesnt like this at all being the only one not in on the joke
whatd you do to me
just had you stretched out as stiff as a board between those two chairs he points to two dining room chairs that are sitting back to back four or five
philip cont d lighting a lighter and ran this back and forth under your legs
tom feels the backs of his legs
he looks at maggie
you said it didnt hurt at all
and he kept it moving
hey thanks a lot it was very nice of you not to burn my flesh
joey ariola woulda burned it
they laugh again
tom looks at him stunned
the kid who beat you up all the time when you were twelve
you told us all about him
you were cryin and everything
tom seethes humiliated
vanessa looks at her watch
low to vanessa dont
not time yet
not time for what
tom you didnt do anything embarrassing or anything
aright somebody else go

tom look nobody
well then i guess the partys over aint it

lightening up a bit i mean joey ariola christ i havent thought about him in maybe ten years and come on man somebody else has gotta go
dont make me be the only
on the mantle over the fireplace a clock chimes
everyone is immediately silent staring at tom
he looks at the clock
he lifts his foot pulls off his shoe and throws it out the window
there is an explosion of laughter
whyd you do that tom
have no idea
even more laughter now everybodys slapping him on the back
tom nods yeah yeah laugh it up
i couldnt resist
tom cranks an arm around philips neck and pulls him down choking him
but its playful his sense of humor returning
any other surprises you left in my head you fuckin dead man you
tom and maggie lie in bed awake
i hope its a girl i cant help it
six brothers i mean give me a break
im sick of all these balls around the house
he doesnt laugh
she rolls over strokes his chest with one hand
maggie cont d whats the matter

how did this happen
she slides one hand down under the covers
imitating him please baby please baby just this one time i cant feel anything with one of those on
no i now how it happened im just sayin
youre gonna have to stop work at least for a while
ill be workin saturdays for at least another year maybe two
you dont have to
well get by we always do
tom stares at a dark brown water stain on the ceiling
how many times i gotta ask harry to fix that
he said he fixed this place up so how come the roof leaks every time it rains
her hand is moving
maggie you dont think i mean ten twelve years from now
i dont want you to think im gonna be a line man forever you know like frank or somethin
its a good job
you know how many guys would kill for your job
im smarter than that i know i am
kisses his ear relax
shes making it hard for him to concentrate
im smarter than philip christ six years in college hes still got his head up his ass
i just want you to know this aint where i plan to stop
she licks his ear
he closes his eyes
tom cont d all my life i feel like theres something better inside me its trying like hell to get out and its like x wont let it
she rolls on top of him and whispers
let me help
the clock reads a
maggie is asleep tom is lying on his back still awake
he looks over at the clock agitated
he stares up at the ceiling
he closes his eyes
races across the back of his eyelids philips face close to his a finger held in front of him
a flame leaping out from a cigarette lighter
six more faces pressed in close to his
himself floating in an armchair above an empty movie theatre
tom snaps his eyes open
he rolls over onto his side punching his pillow
he closes his eyes again
faster this time
we share his point of view a twelve year old boy beats us up in an alley near a dumpster
a fourteen year old girl kisses us behind a brick building
a vicious dog sinks its teeth into our calf
maggie drowning reaches out to us
the images increase in speed a half a dozen flip by so fast theyre almcst subliminal a car tire a broken arm falling into water breaking window ham and eggs
a bolt of lightning
tom sits up abruptly shaking his head to clear it
the fuck man
he puts his hands to the side of his head
maggie stirs but doesnt wake up
tom gets up and walks out
as he passes jakes room he does a double take
the four year old is awake
not just awake but standing next to his bed perfectly straight staring at the open doorway
tom steps in
he can see by the light of the nightlight
the little boy doesnt answer
tom walks slowly over to the boy and squats down in front of him putting his arms on the boys shoulders
tom cont d are you okay
jake just looks at tom straight into his fathers eyes
the boys face lights up in a wide smile
he reaches out with one hand and rests his fingertips on toms forehead
dont be afraid of it daddy
the hell does that mean
but before tom can respond jake turns climbs back in bed rolls over to face the wall and goes back to sleep
tom shakes some advil into his palm washes three down with a glass of water
he runs water in the sink splashes some on his face
he straigltens looks in the mirror as he wipes his dripping face
he stares at himself for a moment then summons his nerve and closes his eyes
more images come
the front of toms own house from a distance
a man in an overcoat stands on the porch waving to us to come in
rough hands attack us covering our eyes and face
a face close to ours but blurry and distorted as if seen through dirty blue tinted eyeglasses
wooden floorboards as we race down toward them
we hit hard and our blood sprays out onto the wood
toms eyes pop open
that was disturbing
tom strides into the living room
their house is small crowded with kids toys and furniture they got for their wedding
tom paces back and forth holding his head in his hands
he turns and bolts into the kitchen
tom rips the refrigerator open and searches the top shelf
he finds what hes looking for a large carton of orange juice
he opens a cabinet takes out a glass and fills it
he upends the glass drains it in one gulp
still unsatisfied he picks up the carton
he drinks the rest
juice runs down his chin
tom drops onto the sofa
he sits for a moment trying to regain himself
his breathing returns to normal
he sits forward picks up the remote off the coffee table points it at the tv and turns it on
when he sits back theres a woman sitting next to him
shes eighteen or nineteen years old so pale her skins almost luminous
shes attractive but odd she wears a billowy black dress with a diamond pattern bangles up and down each wrist
her lips are light blue her eyes red rimmed
steam rises softly from her hair and skin when she speaks her breath comes out of her mouth in clouds of vapor
you can kiss me if you want to
tom bolts to his feet and staggers away from the couch
the woman stares intently at him and says something else but her words are lost under the rising sound of static on the television
she repeats but he can only see her lips moving the words are lost under the static
realizing tom turns hurriedly toward the tv and hits the mute switch
when he turns back the woman is gone
he stands in the middle of the room looking all around him
but hes alone
tom crawls back into bed and pulls the blankets up tight around him
drops over him and he nearly jumps out of his skin
its maggie rolling over to embrace him in her sleep
he takes her hand in his and lies still eyes wide open
tom and maggie sit at the kitchen table
from the living room we can hear a kids morning show on the television
tom is wearing jeans and a phone company uniform shirt
maggie is staring at him
they keep their voices low
what do you mean like
you mean like a hallucination
i was awake i know that
she nods thinking no idea how to deal with this
did you uh get her name
you know she didnt menti
you sure you werent dreami
i had this headache like you wouldnt believe and i was thirsty as hell
what should we do
you want to call philip
yeah ill call him
but i dont think hes got a fuckin clue in life
from the living room jake laughs uproariously at something on the tv
how about my cousin elizabeth
i dont need brain surgery i just had a weird thing happen thats all
like a hypnosis hangover
one time deal dont worry about it
well if anything like this happens again we should go talk to elizabeth
theres a pickup football game in the street a half a dozen sixteen and seventeen year olds timing their plays to coincide with the red lights
tom gets into a pickup truck with a phone compaty logo on the door starts it up and pulls forward to the neat house
he hits the horn
while he waits he turns and loo s back up at the front of his own house
one of the images that blasted through his mind last night
its his own house on a wintry day
a man in an overcoat is standing on the porch waving an arm in a friendly way cmon in
but the image is silent slow and eerie
we move slowly toward the porch toward the man in the overcoat
tom turns slowly away from his house just as bangs off his windshield nearly breaking it
two bodies hurtle through the air and land on his hood with a loud metal tom jumps a foot
he gets out of the car
adam mccarthy seventeen climbs off the hood embarrassed
jesus you guys scared the shit out of me
the kid with adam doesnt seem embarrassed he just reaches for the football
tom beats him to it
tom cont d you gotta play right here in the middle of the street
frank is out of his house now approaching the truck
he wears the same uniform shirt as tom carries a tool belt over his shoulder
lighten up tommy you sound like your own grandfather
looking at his hood aw man its dented
this aint even my truck
theyre gonna dock me for this
thatll pop right out
use one of them plunger things
adam say youre sorry
im really sorry mr
there you go he said hes sorry whaddya want from a kid
frank gets in the truck
the other football players walk toward tom calling for the ball
kurt damon a great looking seventeen year old stares pointedly at the ball in toms hand
tom looks at him
hell of an arm ya got there
kurt smiles and shrugs
tom tosses the ball back to him
kurt turns and catches it behind his back as he walks away
tom gets back in and closes the door
that damon kid hes gonna break your old passing records this friday
bound to happen some time
comin to the game
starts the car yeah im comin im comin harry o
harry damon the guy from across the street is headed toward him
but tom notices something behind harry
a police car has turned onto the block and is rolling to a stop
the uniformed cop behind the wheel is staring out the window looking right at tom
harry comes up to the open window and starts talking but tom is looking past him at the cop who has stopped now
harry cont d thought id stop by and pick up the rent
save you the trip across the street
its still two days yet isnt it
tom looks more closely at the cop
he realizes the cop isnt looking at him hes looking past him toward toms house
yeah just thought youd want to get it out of your hair
well my checkbooks inside
i can wait
hey frank some game we picked to miss last night huh
how many yards adam end up with
tom turns in his seat following the cops line of vision
two hundred eleven and two touchdowns
harry lets out a low whistle
tom sees what the cop is looking at so intently its jake whos playing on the sidewalk in front of their house while maggie watches
tom turns back but as he does the police car is just pulling away
the signal division of the local phone company has a large main floor
a twenty foot wall on one side of the room shows a forest of jagged blinking lines
tom is wedged between giant walls of circuit boards
he pulls a red circuit clip from his belt and picks a line at random
he pulls up the test handset unit that hangs fromhis belt and listens hoping from a dial tone
instead he cuts in on a voice o
on phone line which was okay i guess but then he told me he loves me and it was just like oh my god can you please make yourself any
tom pulls off the clip and picks another line
now its a voice o
unless they find out we already locked in with cooper at eighty so its imperative we lead them to believe were honestly trying to tom clips to another line
its a sexy womans voice
start at my lips and lick your way all the way down to my tom starts to unclip then hesitates only human
the voice abruptly changes
voice coast d hey did somebody pick up on your end
is your wife there
tom unclips and picks another line
he gets a dial tone
he enters a number on his headset
a sleepy voice answers
phil its tom

philip maggiea brother is still in bed in his apartment
its a smallish place one wall is all windows with a lovely view of a factory its stacks belching black smoke into the air

tom stops thinking for a long moment

but tom has hung up
philip unplugs the phone and goes back to sleep
jake sits at the kitchen table in his pajamas eating a bowl of cereal
maggie in work clothes is walking back and forth behind him talking on the phone finishing her makeup drinking coffee and doing the dishes
hi adriana its maggie

tom reaches the open doorway and glances back inside
dorothy is looking at him as he swings the door shut
ext front porch nif ht the buzzing stops the momen the door is shut
tom and maggie go down the steps
tom lookz back over his shoulder at the house in time to see dorothys face peering out between the blinds at them
she releases the blinds and they snap back into place
tom and maggie walk down a crowded sidewalk with frank and sheila from next door

tom glances up at a mercury vapor streetlight as they pass under it
the same buzzing sound the one he heard when he first looked at dorothy comes back now seeming to come from the street light
tom shakes it off
frank cost d now adam and i admit l am biased but my kid is having ona hell of a season and its like nol
if theyd just give him he carries he could break a thousand yards
and on an eight game schedule
he pulls out a pint bottle of schnapps and has a bump offers one to tom who declines
a sexy teenage girl walks past
sheila and maggie walk together
sheila stares at frank as he ogles the teenager
look at him
why doesnt he just lick them when they walk by
according to tom the average guy carries around a hard on two and a half hours out of every day
what are you gonna do
ive got a few ideas
a middle aged woman walks past and frank gives her the big crank around
sheila cont d look at that
hes not even picky
i swear to god that man will stick it in a bowl of soup if its still warm
maggie notices tom up ahead with a hand to his temple
she catches up
are you okay
he forces a smile
they head into a crowded tunnel that leads into the stadium
frank raises his voice still higher
it becomes a horrible drone to tom
six eighty three with three game
left he only needs to average ti
iat a hundred and five hundred and six yards a game
he hits a thousand and were talkin major scholarships the kid could write his own ticket
that kinda things good for everybody helps the whole neighborhood
hes goin a hell of a lot farther than i ever did
look at the quality of the tail hes already gettin
he passed me in that department when he was about fourteen
he passes tom the bottle
this time he takes a swig
they come through the tunnel and into the stands
below the field is brightly lit
franks voice is thankfully drowned out by the enthusiasm of the crowd
they make their way to the first open seats in the bleachers and sit down
the crowd is delirious with anticipation and a bit loaded theres a lot of schnapps in that crowd and beers snuck in here and there
and thats the grown ups
the visitors kick off
the crowd roars
tom tries to concentrate on the game but hes totally distracted
he looks to the right drawn by a flash of light
a car is pulling into the parking lot at the end of the field with its high beams on
tom stares at the lights
the buzzing sound comes back louder the longer he stares
the crowd roars its approval of something
tom turns back tries to follow the game
he wipes sweat from his forehead
maggie is staring at him
she takes his hand and leans over shouting into his ear
as tom turns to her his eye is drawn by something just over her head
a giant light stanchion towers over them
when tom s ares directly into the dozen large globes the buzzing souni overwhelms him nearly deafening
his hands shoot up to his ears and he leaps to his feet
sf s taxing bim awway
tom fights his way out of the row climbing right over people
they shout their objections
tom races down the now empty tunnel
a light shines at the far end buzzing madly
a few seconds later maggie starts into the tunnel
tom bursts out onto the busy sidewalk threading his way between people and cars as fast as he can
maggie follows a few moments later
tom races around the corner and onto his block
he bolts across the street forcing a car to lock em up at the last second
the driver shouts tom keeps running
he reaches the sidewalk just in front of his house and stops in his tracks staring at the house wild eyed
all the lights are off
he bounds up the steps and tries the door
he fumbles in his pockets for the keys
tom unlocks the door and bursts inside
he races up the stairs
tom smacks open the door to jakes room and flicks on the lights
in jakes bed the covers are pulled back the sheets are rumpled
but jake js gone
tom races out
still staring at that empty bed we can hear other doors in the house being thrown open lights being switched on and toms outraged voice calling out for his son
maggie comes hurrying up the steps of the porch just as the front door flies open
what the hell is the she took him
oh my god
she bounds up the steps calling out for jake
she cant be that far
he runs to the corner desperate and looks up and down the street in both directions
there are a lot of people out she could be anywhere
he turns looks up and down the side street
nothing in the first direction but when he looks the other way he hears a faint buzzing sound in the distance
he doesnt hesitate just takes off toward it
tom is running as hard as he can
he stops abruptly
the buzzing sound is gone
he looks to his right
behind a wall there is a large parking lot filled with buses
he turns around
a dull white glow comes from the windows of the place on the corner
he looks up at the sign
its a greyhound bus station
tom hurries back toward it reaching the door just as maggie comes running up from the opposite direction
wait right here keep your eyes open
he opens the door and goes inside
tom steps into the station still breathing hard
the buzzing sound returns
but from where
is it in his mind this time or really here in the bus station
the place is empty except for one person sitting on a wooden bench with their back to him near the departure doors
tom walks slowly across the place to the figure
as he draws closer he sees jakes face over dorothys shoulder
jakes eyes are open and hes staring up at the ceiling
tom follows his sons gaze
jake is staring up at the lights the old style fluorescent tubes that give the place its cancerous look
the tubes buzz loudly
its the sound toms been hearing
jake sees his father and smiles
tom puts a finger to his lips shhhh
jake yawns closes his eyes and drops his head onto dorothys shoulder
he goes back to sleep
tom walks slowly around the end of the bench
dorothy is singing softly an old nursery rhyme
she looks up suddenly and sees tom
she starts to jerk to her feet
tom puts a hand out take it easy
dorothy sits back caught
tom steps closer to her carefully
he holds both his hands out palms up
give him to me
she shakes her head no
outside a siren whines and a police car flashes past the window its red lights spinning
they both hear it and glance over then look back at each other
tom raises an eyebrow
she knows what he means
tom contd give him to me dorothy
trembling dorothy reaches out jake in her arms
tom gently takes the boy from her and holds him tight
the front door flies open and maggie races inside
tom gives jake over to her
half asleep oh hi mommy
shes relieved but livid
to dorothy what the hell is the matter with you
dorothy jumps to her feet and races through the door that leads to the back where the buses leave from
to maggie take him home
ill be there as soon as i can
he runs after dorothy
dorothy races out of the bus station and into the forest of parked buses
tom comes out a few seconds later giving chase
dorothy cuts between two parked buses and is nearly hit by a third thats just arriving
its horn blares as she trips and falls to the ground the bus just missing as it roars past her
tom reaches her
dorothy writhes on the ground sobbing raking her hands through the gravel hysterical
sit up i want to talk to you
she manages to drag herself into a sitting position
she shoves back against the wheel of a bus
beyond them the bus that nearly hit her stops on the far side of the lot
dorothy is quivering still crying
tom squats in front of her a few feet away
tom cant d why were you taking my son
do you want me to call the police
shakes her head no then tell me why you took him
he isnt safe in your house
why do you say that
he told me
he told me so
the driver of the bus that nearly hit her is out of his bus now
he shouts at them from the other side of the lot
jake said that
she nods what else did he say
i was sitting there i was watching him sleep i was just watching him like im supposed to and
and he sat up in bed he looked right at me and he said im not safe in this house
two times he said it and then he went back to sleep
where were you taking him
to my fathers house
my real father not like poison on her tongue duane
jake would be safe at my fathers house wed both be safe there
she nods why arent you safe here
she doesnt answer
the driver is coming over to them still tom cont d dorothy
dorothy why arent you safe here
the driver is still closer
frightened dorothy gets up to run again
tom grabs her
tom coat d hey wait a sec as his hands close around her arms flashes through his mind
a mans face sweaty and unshaven leers over us too close
tom abruptly pulls back from dorothy
he is enraged
who is he
she just looks at him frightened
he shakes her violently
tom cont d duane fortyish slouches on a sofa watching moe hit curly with a rake
duanes drinking bourbon
in his defense he is using a glass
duanes face is the one tom just saw in the image in his mind
duane hears the front door open and close
your moms still at work
hey do you know if she bought any more who the fuck are you
tom is storming across the room toward him
duane cant d hey hey hey hey hey
tom already has duane by the collar
he wrenches him to his feet
duane cont d are you duane
i dont even know who youre duane looks over toms shoulder
dorothy is standing in the doorway frightened
duane cont d dorothy who the fuck is this guy
tom hurls duane across the coffee table knocking over duanes bong
duane hits the floor hard
he starts fumbling in his pocket but tom is on him ripping him to his feet again
shes a little girl you son of a bitch
she s fifteen years old and you fucked her
what the hell is the matter with you
you dont do shit look man i dont know who you are or what she told you but tom hurls duane across the room
he smashes into a bookcase breaking the glass shelves and knocking a bunch of pictures and knickknacks to the ground
duane screams tries to roll away to escape tom but tom picks him up by the back of his collar and his belt like a dog
he hurls duane toward the stairs
duane crunches down hard
before he can get up tom hauls him to his feet and hurls him furthe up
hes kicking duanes ass up the stairs
at the ttom dorothy watches her hands over her mouth
duane lands a few feet ahead of tom
this time hes got a second or two and he manages to dig the butterfly knife he was groping for out of his pocket
he whips it around opening it but tom is fast and crazy with rage he just grabs the thing by the blade and rips it away from duane
blood flows over toms knuckles as he tightens his grip on the knife
he twists it around holding it by the butt
theres madness in toms eyes
wielding the knife you got ten minutes
pack your shit
you dont leave a note you dont try to call and if you ever ever come back here again ill know ill find you and ill stick this so far
into you theyll never get it out
you got it
duane nods terrified
dorothy sits on her hands at the edge of the sofa waiting nervously
tom comes down the stairs
he folds the knife uncertainly never handled one of these things before
he shoves it in his pocket
ill stay until hes gone
upstairs dresser drawers slam duane curses
tom cont d shouldnt be long
she hurries into the kitchen
tom looks around at the mess hes made
hes embarrassed frightened by his own rage
dorothy comes back with a dish towel
she takes toms hand wipes the blood away and wraps the towel around it
dorothy cont d than you
he starts to pick up the things that were knocked off the bookcase
tell your mother ill pay for this
he picks up a framed photograph
broken glass falls out of the frame as he turns it over
dorothy contd whats the matter
tom just stares at the picture
dorothy cont d what
tom turns the picture around to show dorothy
the woman in the picture is about eighteen or nineteen bears a faint resemblance to dorothy and is the same woman he saw in his living room
dorothy coast d yeah
who is this woman
did she have a black dress kind of a diamond pattern on it
she wore a lot of bracelets those thick ones different colors all up and down her arms
yeah all t time she probably still does
you know that
upstairs there is a tremendous slam as a closet door closes and duane shouts
where is she
i dont know
can i talk to her
she ran away
about six months ago
where did she go
i dont know
she dont write or nothin
tom looks down at the photograph again
whats your sisters name dorothy
int tom i maggies house night the red light glows on the baby monitor and jakes breathing can be heard from in his bedroom
tom and maggie sit on the couch in their living room the nonitor beside them just one light on
he has his arms arounc her holding her tight
his hand is bandaged
thats what she said
where have i heard that name before
dorothy said she ran away about six months ago
but she could still be around
hiding or something
i mean she could have actually been here when you saw her
if she was shes very quick getting in and out of a room
where was she
when you saw her where was she exactly
on the cushion right next to you
maggie looks down at the empty half of the couch freaked out
she pulls in closer to him
what was it like
at the game i mean how did you know about jake
did you see anything
its hard to explain
i just got this feeling
like when i was drowning
a little bit
but a hundred times stronger
does it hurt when it happens
like you wouldnt believe
fecls like my brain is tearing in half
god tommy whats the matter with you
why do you assume its bad
maybe this is a good thing
if your brain is tearing in half
i told you there was somethin in me
maybe its comin out
i like it better in
just roll with it
whats the worst that can happen
youll go insane
kill me and jake first
well yeah that
i want you to go see my cousin elizabeth
make sure theres nothing wrong
just tell her about the headaches thats all she needs to know you dont have to bring up the other stuff
suddenly he smiles
hey know what
she looks at him it is a girl
she furrows her brow how do you know
then follows his gaze down to her belly where his hand is resting
tom dressed in a patients gown walks down a hospital corridor with dr
elizabeth noonan fortyish
elizabeth makes notes on a clipboard walking and talking fast all business
elizabeth does not have the human touch
do you have any metal plates in your skull
any shrapnel lodged anywhere in your body
no cardiac pacemaker i assume iron filings near your eyes
you dont work with sheet metal do you
they turn down another corridor
elizabeth cont d do you have an inner ear transplant
aneurism clips in your brain
do you suffer from claustrophobia
only in like really small spaces
she looks at him straight you have a great sense of humor
right then jog left
do we really gotta do this
youve had no head trauma no serious viral infections you can recall you havent been out of the country youre not a drug user you have no history of migraines
i suppose i could open up your skull in the operating room and then decide what to do but id rather take a few pictures first wouldnt you
she pushes through a set of double doors
the mri machine is a long tunnel with a body slab sticking out obscenely like a tongue
two nurses stand on either side of it
one wall of the room is glass behind the glass are the technicians and maggie who waves supportively
hows it work
elizabeth goes to a computer terminal and types in some commands
it creates an electromagnetic field thirty thousand times stronger than the earths
that stimulates your brains protons to align themselves
then we shoot radio waves into you which knocks the protons out of alignment
they then realign themselves sending out radio signals we record on the scanner
the computer reads the signals and makes a series of detailed cross sections of the layers of tissue
tom looks at the machine then back at her
can i have another valium
tom lies down on the tongue
the nurses wrap sheets around his arms and tuck them in under his body immobilizing them
he looks at one of them questioningly
so your arms dont touch the sides of the machine
that would be bad
she smiles and nods
the other nurse puts a white cloth over his hair
your party hat
he tries to smile but he is unnerved
elizabeth leans in staring down at tom
its so nice you and maggie finally came to see me at work
a technician hits a series of switches
the tongue starts to move sliding into the tunnel
tom lies still staring upward as he is pulled inside like a corpse in a drawer sliding back into the wall of the morgue
its only about two feet across and less from top to bottom
tom blinks staring up at the ceiling as the tongue comes to a stop
its incredibly claustrophobic
kinda hot in the coffin
elizabeths voice comes blaring out of speakers mounted on either side of the tunnel
yo hey hey woah im right here
can you turn it down a little bit
elizabeth leans back from a microphone and turns to a technician
the technician enters some commands on a keyboard
the giant hammers that are contained in the cylinders that surround the tunnel start to move slowly at first
elizabeth turns to maggie
did he bring any music
yeah right here
she hands him a cassette
elizabeth puts it into a tape deck and pushes play
the hammers pick up speed and these things move
it gets noisy fast
toms eyes widen
the hammers whip faster
their pounding is tremendous
toms music starts playing from the speakers
its the doors people are strange
the hammers whip faster
elizabeth was right its good the music is loud because the sound coming from the hammers is deafening like gunshots going off all around his head
tom in spite of himself bursts out laughing
they can hear the thundering hammers the blaring music and above it all toms crazy kind of laughter
elizabeth looks at maggie
three electronic screens two red and one whitish blue display various cross sections of toms brain
graphs and columns of numbers are listed alongside
no tumors no growths no scars or lesions no intrusions or damaged tissue of any kind
except for one tiny abnormality your brain anatomy is textbook
well its so insignificant its hardly worth mentioning
she leans forward to one of the screens and points to a spot on a cross section
elizabeth cont d its the parietal lobe
theres a slight distension just the tiniest bulge here in the arc of the crescent
one in a half million maybe it doesnt really have a name
but it isnt consequential
wouldnt have any effect on cognitive processes
theres nothing wrong with me i gotta get back to work
stands and shakes hands thank you for everything elizabeth i owe you a giant one hey you think i can get some of that valium to go
elizabeth scowls at him
tom cont d worth a try
take care say hi to michael
to maggie ill pick up jake i told him id take him to the pier tonight
he heads for the door eager to get the hell out of there
maggie lingers looking at elizabeth hopeful
theres really nothing wrong with him
nothing at all
i said nothing physical
maggie is in the bedroom cleaning up
she picks up toms pair of jeans from the floor and folds them over one arm
something thunks to the floor
she picks it up
its the butterfly knife the one he took from duane
she stares at it fascinated and frightened
she lets it drop open
there is dried blood on the blade
gingerly she closes it again
she opens a drawer and puts it in then thinks better of that
she takes it out again looks for a place to put it
she drops it in her purse and zips it shut
shell deal with it later
navy pier is an amusement park shopping mall built on a pier jutting out into lake michigan
its a nice night the pier is crowded just enough urban edge to be interesting
a figure bobs along above the crowd jake sitting on toms shoulders
they stop and join a crowd watching a juggler a good one keeps five burning pins in the air
jake suddenly looks up confused by something
he stares past the juggler through the flames
behind the juggler a uniformed cop is staring at the little boy its the same cop who was parked outside their house earlier
jake stares back the flaming pins flying up between them
tom moves on his boy still on his shoulders
the cop turns and watches them go
jake turns looking back over his shoulder at the cop
the cop raises a hand and waves
jake just stares
there is an elaborate model train set on display in the window
woah check it out
he stops helps jake down off his shoulders
jake presses right up against the glass staring at the train as it circles the track
tom squats admiring it with him
the cop is still watching them
he walks closer stops only about ten feet away staring
tom glances up sees him thinks nothing of it
the op steps closer
tom sees the reflection of the cop
closer now staring
tom turns and smiles tight lipped
he recognizes him from the other day
the cop smiles back doesnt go away
to jake hey look at that one
he carries jake to the next window over a different display
the cop wanders closer
tom finally turns to him tense
tom cont d how ya doin
hes staring at jake
is there a law against lookin in the window now
oh no course not
im off duty
i live right up there
see ya later
he sweeps jake up onto one hip and starts to walk away
its even stronger in him than it is in you
the cop smiles and makes a face you heard me
tom cont d i dont know what youre talking about
jont be afraid of it
tom just star
s at the cop trembling slightly
the cop walks forward
fascinated tom does not back away
the cop lowers his voice
cop cont d youre not alone
tom is too rattled to speak
cop cont d you dont know about cacophony yet
tom shakes his head no
the cop pulls out a note pad scribbles something on a page tears it out and holds it out to tom
cop cont d come next time
his hand shaking tom accepts the paper
the cop reaches out and tousles jakes hair
cop coast d bye jake
the cop turns and walks away
the cop looks back over his shoulder and smiles
tom looks at his son as if hes never seen him before
jake fresh from a bath and in his pajamas sits on the floor of his room playing with model cars intent
hes humming a soft tune to himself the same one he hummed during his bath in the opening
tom and maggie sit near him staring at him
theyre freaked out
what have they got on their hands here
their tone is soft gently probing
jake do you remember the other day when we were talking in the kitchen
jake doesnt look up just keeps playing and humming
maggie cont d i was loo
ing for a baby sitter remember
jake plays and you said samantha told you about dorothy
do you remember that
he keeps playing humming
mommys asking you a question
is samantha someone who talks to you sometimes jake
she tries a different route
maggie contd can you remember any of the things that saman jake looks up sharply
dont ask the boy any more questions
they freeze staring at him
his tone was odd
and did he just refer to himself in the third person
jake cant d talk to me
he goes back to playing and to that little tune
its becoming rather haunting
maggie and tom look at each other
tom and maggie are asleep in bed
suddenly toms eyes pop open
he sits up
his head is killing him again
theres a glass of water on the night table
le grabs it and drinks greedily
he turns and looks to the open loorway
he stands up
he looks down at maggie whos still sound asleep
he walks to the door
maggie stirs feeling him gone
tom walks down the narrow hallway toward the staircase at the far end
he starts down the stairs
halfway down he dares a look through the wooden posts that support the handrail
samantha is standing in the middle of the room
she looks up at him
for a long moment they just stare at each other
steam rises lightly from her as she breathes
tom is shaking barely finds his voice
she speaks but when her voice comes out its horrible and distorted muffled in a strange way
he takes a few trembling steps down the stairs closer to her
she walks forward a step or two
she speaks again louder but the voice is still unintelligible and bizarre
tom reaches the bottom of the stairs
she reaches out a hand
he stares terrified
the hand draws closer
almost beyond his own control tom raises his own hand
she comes closer
tom is frozen at the bottom of the stairs
their hands draw closer still
their fingertips touch
tom gasps as if something very heavy were put down on his chest
his mouth drops open his chest twitches
he cant breathe
they stand there frozen in that position
tom tries but cant draw air
maggies voice calls out from the top ci the stairs
he cant answer
hes panicked but unable to move
with every twitch of his chest clouds of steam burst from his mouth all the air going out none coming in
from the top of the stairs maggie can see him standing there hand outstretched into the darkness touching nothing
but from toms point of view hes touching fingertips with samantha
hes frozen breathless and now his cheeks start to turn pale unnaturally white
another few seconds of this and hell pass out
maggie con t d tom
she races down the stairs
maggie cont d tom cant look at her cant move
a tear rolls down his cheek as his lips begin to turn blue
maggie cont d tom br
she grabs hold of him
as soon as maggie makes contact tom collapses
he sees samantha break away from him with a shriek of irritation
she moves not quite walking but a herky jerky kind of lateral movement toward the dining room fast like someone on a dozen espressos an angry thing that has to
slow itself down to a crawl just to talk to us
in the dining room she flops over onto the floor like a reflection appearing suddenly on the surface of a pond
into the floor she disappears
maggie grabs toms face and turns it toward her
he takes a big lungful of air
maggie cont d was she here
tom nods sucking air greedily
maggie contd why
i think we better find out
its a street party and its jammed
police barricades are at both ends of the block
half barrels of beer sit in big plastic garbage cans ice dumped over them
everyone seems to have agreed on which radio station to listen to and most of the couple dozen cars parked in the driveways have their radios tuned to it loud
the windows hanging open
outside bernies tap the bar on the corner a dozen drunk guys are running pass patterns out the front door cutting left at the mailbox and catching a football thrown
from inside the bar out an open window
well they dont actually catch the ball
the homeless guy weve seen on the street a few times is drinking right out of one of the beer taps while nobody is watching
lenny the local crank we met before is outraged
he chases him off trying to kick him in the ass but spilling his own beer in the process
lenny cont d to no one in particular you see what im talkin about
you see what i mean
jake plays with a couple other neighborhood kids
frank is giving a lurid lesson on the proper way to pump the keg to two attractive young women
tom joins him
err r ab a

he gestures to sheila franks wife whos about ten feet away keeping an angry eye on him
what can i do
nature commands me to spread my seed
i hear and obey
sure great just dont be surprised if some day sheila digs out your and buries a slug or two in your ass
the woman cant even step on a spider
spider doesnt fuck around on her
sheila is talking to maggie disgusted with frank

oh frank would love that
i want him out

how long have you guys been there

somebody actually manages to catch one of the passes coming from out of the bar and is immediately tackled by three drunks
on the pavement
tom is now talking to harry damon

talking to a couple other guys

pulling free dad
behind them the guys playing football out of bernies tap have now organized a full fledged game of tackle in the street over the objections of their wives and girlfriends
who shout at them to stop
i embarrass him

toms askin about that muller girl from over by baldwin you know the one that ran away
jesus lenny dont use that word
she was almost your age adam
you know anything about her
adam doesnt answer right away
they all look at him
suddenly the guys playing football run a play right through the middle of them sweaty middle aged bodies fly in every direction
everybody shouts and lunges backward protecting their beers
the conversation is broken up
but the football players are upset and a fight breaks out
the crowd gets out of the way half to watch the fight with glee the other half to shake their heads and watch the fight
while the fight goes on in the background adam wanders away from the group and sits down on the hood of kurt damons car
kurt notices him and comes over
he sits next to him
kurt is looking atihim im fine
you dont look fine
how do i look
hands up in surrender all right all right
just if theres you know if theres somethin you wanna bullshit about or anything just let me know
you could climb off my back thatd help
adam walks away
two police cars arrive their lights flashing
cops jump out and wade through the crowd to bust up the fight
so much for the party
sheila shakes her head
it cant ever just be nice
someones always got to ruin it
the city lights are on
the sound of sobbing rises faintly over them
were on the roof of a house and a figure with its back to us is doing the crying
the figure drinks from a bottle
a long hard pull
coming around thefrontwe see the figure is adam mccarthy frank and sheilasson sitting on the roof of his house staring out at thecityand getting quietly shit faced
tom pries his eyes open exhausted
sunlight streams through the window right into his face
he squints looks at the clock
he sits up painfully
a beam of sunlight cuts him right across the eyes
tom pulls his jeans on
he sits on a chair puts on a shoe
but the other ones gone
he feels under the chair
he opens the closet door
he looks under the bed
there it is
he grabs it
a note is taped to the bathroom mirror went to the park tom takes it down and reads it
tom comes downstairs and heads for the kitchen
theres someone standing in his living room in the doorway from the dining room
its frank his neighbor from next door wearing a red shirt
frank is staring at the floor
what are you doing here
frank looks up at him
his face is sad
theyre going to kill you tommy
you and maggie both
frank turns and walks to the front door
he opens it walks outside and sits on the top step of the porch looking out at the street
tom follows him
its a beautiful day but the street is still kind of a m
ss from the party yesterday
tom comes out and looks down at frank whos just sitting there staring out at the litter
why did you say that frank
in his own world this is a decent neighborhood
on the street two kids ride their bikes straight at each other full tilt screaming
at the last second one of the kids swerves the other taunts him with cries of chicken
a bird swoops over toms head too low and tom flinches
he walks across the driveway toward franks house
the mailman waves to him headed down the block
tom waves back
tom walks up the steps to franks front door and knocks
a voice calls from inside
tom opens the door and comes in
adam franks son is standing in the middle of the living room floor a big smile on his face and one arm behind his back
want to see what ive got
adam pulls his arm around from behind his back
hes holding a with a carved white handle
tom cont d is that your dads
come here tom walks toward him
adam cont d closer
tom walks closer
hes right in front of adam
adam cont d i bet you never saw this before
he points the gun barrel at tom then swings it around and points it at his own heart
oh dont do that
adam pulls the trigger
tom screams as adam collapses to the floor blood pouring from his chest
his body convulses and toms eyes pop open in bed
that was weird
tom blinks exhausted
sunlight streams through the window right into his face
he squints looks at the clock
he sits up painfully
a beam of sunlight cuts him right across the eyes
tom pulls on a pair of jeans
he sits down puts on a shoe
but the other ones gone
he feels under the chair
he opens the closet door
tom blinks unsettled
this is kinda familiar
he turns and looks at the bed
please dont be under there
he bends down lifts the blanket and looks under the bed
theres his shoe
tom cont d shit
he grabs it
a note is taped to the bathroom mirror went to the park tom winces as he takes it down and reads it
shod tom comes down the stairs and into the living room
franks not there thank god
tom goes to the front door and opens it
but franks not on the porch either
tom steps outside
its a beautiful day but the street is still kind of a mess from the party yesterday
a shout draws toms attention
those same two kids ride their bikes at each other full tilt
tom walks down the steps of the porch staring at them as they scream
at the last second one of the kids turns away
the other taunts him with cries of chicken
tom stands frozen on the sidewalk
a bird swoops low over his head he really flinches this time
the mailman waves to him headed down the block
too stunned tom doesnt wave back
he turns panicked and looks at franks house
he starts to walk toward it slowly at first then picking up speed jogging across the driveway
hes halfway there when a gunshot rings out from inside
he races the rest of the way bounds up the steps to the house rips open the screen door
but the front door is locked
he pounds on it
tom coast d he pounds harder but theres no answer
he goes to the window beside the door and peers through it
he sees adam lying on the floor in the middle of the living room
oh god no
tom picks up a porch chair and heaves it through the window
glass shatters and sprays all over the floor
tom knocks the rest out of the frame with his elbow and climbs into the house
he races over to adams body
there is a pool of blood around his chest and his body is convulsing
in his right hand he clutches a with a carved white handle
oh god no jesus no please
he grabs a blanket off a chair nearby presses it to adams chest trying to stop the bleeding
tom cont d this is really happening
its really happening
tom sits on his front steps shell shocked red light flashing off his face
an ambulance and two police cars are parked in front of the house next door radios squawking with official activity
tom just stares
a car comes barreling around the corner and squeals to a halt in front of the house
frank and sheila leap out of the car and race toward the house
tom watches as theyre intercepted by a cop who tries to restrain them for a second
but theyre hysterical theyve obviously been told something serious has happened and theyre desperate to get inside
they blow past the cop and hurry up the stairs just as three paramedics wheel a stretcher out of the house headed for the ambulance
the sheet isnt over adams head at least but thats about the only good sign theyre working on him frantically
tom buries his head in his lap as he hears the cries of adams parents franks anguished disbelieving bellow sheilas horrified scream
close on a torn off piece of notebook paper with an address and a time scribbled on it
the word cacophony is legible
maggie picks it up stares at it for a moment then hands it to tom who is by the front door zipping his jacket
he takes it and shoves it in his pocket
they both are
she smooths his jacket
he turns to go but she tightens her grip on his jacket
doesnt want to let him go
we need some answers right
maybe theyre the only ones who have any
thinking of something she picks up her car keys from the table by the door and pulls something off the ring
im sure theyre very nice people but in case they arent she hands a thin black cannister to him
maggie coat d mace the shit out of em
he smiles and shoves it in his pocket
she kisses him
tom walks down a street in a dodgy neighborhood at night checking addresses
he stops and looks up at an old formerly grand apartment building thats fallen on hard times
the corridor is even creepier
tom reaches a door all the way at the end and knocks
a moment later the door opens
a very heavy set woman in a floral print dress vivian smiles at him
i hope you like fondue
vivian sets a plate down on a tv tray in front of tom
there is a pile of chunks of various hard to identify meats a silver fondue spear and a chocolate cupcake with an american flag stuck in it
tom sits on an overstuffed couch thats leaking stuffing
listen is uh vivian gives another plate to a man sitting next to tom herman in his seventies in a wheelchair an oxygen tube running into his nostrils
tom coat d is there a guy named neil here
hes a cop
well of course he is
she turns and heads back into the kitchen passing beverly her identical twin whos wearing the same print dress this one with a red background instead of blue
beverly serves two people on the far couch one a thirteen year old girl the other a homey in his early twenties
tom picks up a ham chunk and looks at the steaming fondue pot full of cheese
beverly dips and eats winks at him and flits off across the room
herman turns to tom and asks something in a raspy voice
irritated herman gestures for him to lean closer
what does it want you to do
im sorry i dont under herman wraps his bony fingers around toms wrist
then youre not listening
its his first time herman
give him a break
neil the cop he saw the other night has come in from the kitchen
tonight hes in street clothes
neil cont d points at tom lemme guess
distended parietal lobe right
who are you guys
dont have a name
cacophony society somebody said once that stuck for a while
you know like too many voices in our heads
i think its too melodramatic
how about fellow sufferers
vivian comes in from the kitchen with two big gallon jugs of orange juice
there are aaaahs of appreciation
does everybody here see things like me
buncha freaks huh
speak for yourself
no herman youre a freak
mutants is a better word for the rest of us
he pulls ip a chair and sits down opposite tom
on the other side of tie room vivian and beverly tell an animated two part story to he teenage girl and the homey finishing each others se
neil cont d like any other part of our body our brains have evolved a lot in a hundred thousand years
our first thoughts were formless
an instinctive tie to our environment
but then our brains began to focus
we sacrificed the intuitions we first had so our thoughts could be directed so we could master specific functions
thats where we are at the moment
were brilliant with technique but weve given up instinct
so the next evolutionary step the step yet to come or perhaps its already in the making is actually backward
to maintain our higher functions but reawaken the part of our brain that was pure intuition
that was receptive to anything because it didnt know enough not to believe
youre a freak of nature pal an evolutionary step
youre double jointed
taps his head up here
are we the only ones
ive heard of groups like ours in san francisco new york minneapolis those are just the cities ive been to
tom youre what they used to call a medium
youre like a man in a dark tunnel with a flashlight but the light only goes on once in a while
when it flickers on you get a glimpse of something but not enough of a glimpse to know what it is
just enough to know its there
what about my son
sn files the ncxt generation
much better flashlight
wright if theres all these people who got this power why doesnt everybody know about it
why isnt it common knowledge
a lotta people know
unfortunately the easiest people to convince the believer types they also tend to be the dumbest
and people who demand proof well this isnt something we can control it comes when it comes so if you cant make it happen how can you prove it
its like that singing frog in the cartoon but when the guy puts it on stage it just croaks and he looks like a jerk
herman laughs horribly
he likes that cartoon
neil cont d some of us try anyway
i say who needs that kind of aggravation
this all started when i was hypnotized
is that how it always is
first time ive heard that one
it comes all different ways
sometimes it goes the same way it came
so it does go away
for some people
dont look for rules
were off the map here
what does it want you to do
what does what want me to do
you saw a ghos didnt you
girl that disappeared from my neighborhood
now the kid next door just tried to kill himself
i think he knew something but now ill never know what it was
and i gotta know
look whatd the bitch want
why do you assume she wants something
they always do
something they need finished something they cant do any more
because shes confused
doesnt know why other people wont answer her
she only knows that you will
if she hasnt asked for something yet she will
and once they ask its very difficult to stop yourself from doing it
what do you mean
she can it can make me do something i dont want to do
youll want to
you wont think about anything else
you wont sleep
you wont eat
and god help anyone who tries to stop you
what if i stop me
what if i just dont do it
then you got a weird bitch friend for the rest of your life
just listen to her tom let her tell you what she wants
a hand pounds on an apartment door
philip opens up
he was asleep
what what what
i want you to hypnotize me again
tom paces the floor in philips apartment
just slow down you gotta be a little patient with me here cause um
well tom tom ive got a confession to make
see i i i just smoked this great big fatty a few minutes before you walked in so this shit youre tellin me here is fuckin with my mind just
a little bit extra okay
tom grabs a chair from philips desk and sits
they sit face to face
close your eyes
tom closes his eyes
just like last time i want you to concentrate
listen to the room around you
the factory churns softly outsioi the windows
a few cars in the street below
philip cont d now focus
look at the backs of your eyelids
do you see anything there
opens his eyes would you just get to it please
all right all right
tom closes his eyes again
philip cont d i want you to pretend youre in a movie theatre
were sitting alone in an empty movie theatre
the seats and walls are covered in black velvet
its very dark
everything is covered in black velvet
the seats the walls the floor
in the whole pitch black theatre theres only one thing you can see
the white screen
you drift toward it in your chair
up ahead of us the screen is a dazzling white
we move slowly toward it floating over the seats
there are letters up on the screen
tall thick black letters but theyre out of focus
you drift closer to them
we do drift closer to the blurry letters but our attention is diverted by something
three rows from the screen there is a figure in one of the seats its back to us
toms eyes are sill closed
his face furrows in conctrn
theres someone in here
no its empty
theres someone else here
no man i said youre alone in the theatre
but there is someone in the theatre with us and we continue to drift forward toward them
youre comfortable in your black velvet seat very comfortable
actually were quite nervous drifting closer and closer to that figure sitting in the third row its back to us
your feet and ankles are relaxed
your legs are relaxed
toms eyes are still closed
his chest is twitching
hard to breathe the figure in the seat is only a row or two ahead of us now
its a woman
we keep drifting closer
your hands are limp and heavy
your arms are relaxed
our hand reaches out touches the shoulder of the woman
her face is shrouded in plastic
her mouth presses against the plastic it forms a horrible round contorted in a silent scream
toms eyes flicker madly under the lids
i want you to look at the screen
i cant breathe
look at the screen tom
now toms not just an observer in the movie theatre hes in the movie theatre sitting right next to samantha
shes pawing at him its all he can do to fight her hands off
in their struggle his fingers close around the plastic that shrouds her face
he sweeps it off her head
the screen tom look at the screen
you can read the letters now
samanthas face is bloodied and bruised as the plastic comes off she gasps for air and lets out a ghastly inhuman shriek that fills the theatre
philips voice gets louder as he struggles to maintain control of the hypnosis
look at the screen tom youre close enough now you can read the letters youre right up next to them
tom still holding off samanthas grasping hands turns and looks up at the movie screen
the letters come into focus they spell toms eyes widen as he stares at the screen
three huge letters pop into focus and fill our field of vision
the letters say
toms eyes pop open and he staggers backwards gasping for air knocking the chair out from under himself
he falls back against philips desk scared out of his mind
are you okay
tom wipes his brow hes covered in sweat
plastic like sheets of plastic
he shoves philip out of the way finds the refrigerator on the other side of the room
he rips it open searches for something to drink
philip follows him
i think you need to sit down man something very next level was happening there you should have seen your face
only beer in the fridge
tom cracks one open and upends it
philip cont d uh
want a brew
tom drinks the entire can
philip cont d feel better
tom nods wiping his chin
philip cont d what happened
tom looks at him calming
she told me what she wants
maggies sentra pulls into the driveway of their house parking behind toms phone company truck
she gets out dressed in work clothes and pulls two bags of groceries out of the trunk
she looks at toms truck then at her watch
maggie comes in the front door
calling out hey
youre home early
she struggles to take the keys out of the door while still holding the groceries
maggie cont d can you pick up jake
she comes in and kicks the door shut behind her
toms nowhere to be seen
from somewhere in back there is a faint crunching sound
maggie cont d hello
she heads into the kitchen with the groceries
in the kitchen a letter is waiting in the tray of an old fax machine on the counter
maggie stops in the doorway staring at the floor
muddy footprints lead into and out of the kitchen through the door to the back
thick chunks of wet mud are everywhere
hey look what im not cleaning up
she sets the groceries down on the counter and pulls out a gallon of milk
she opens the refrigerator
she does a double take
the entire top shelf is jammed with cardboard cartons of orange juice
from outside the crunching sound comes again
she follows the muddy footprints out the kitchen door
the back yard is smallish but its a nice little patch of grass
used to be anyway because now there are three large holes in it dug seemingly at random locations
large piles of dirt and rock are heaved up next to the holes
tom stands in one of t
e holes his back to maggie hoisting a large pick axe high over his head
he brings the pick down into the hole
maggie is aghast
she walks slowly across the yard past a pile of shovels and buckets and other tools
she draws closer to him
tom raises the pick high and brings it down hard
the hole hes in at the moment isnt more than two or three feet deep
but hey its early
maggie draws closer
in between swings maggie coast d tom
tom whirls the pick raised to defend himself
his shirts off his chest and face are streaked with mud and sweat
maggie jumps back
you scared me
and with that he turns back to the job
s scared you
maggie cont d tom
maggie cont d what are you doing
doesnt turn around im supposed to dig
maggie walks around him so shes facing him
he keeps working
what do you mean
swings the pick
im supposed to dig
he just looks at her from under his sweaty brows
you know who
maggie cont d oh
tom manages to break apart the rock he was working on with the pick
he tosses the axe which bounces crazily across the grass at maggies feet
she jumps out of the way
he hoists himself out of the hole and picks up the garden hose
he sprays water into the hole
maggie cont d why are you doing this
water softens up the dirt
he tosses the hose aside and grabs a shovel
he jumps back in the hole and starts to dig
no i mean
could you stop for a minute
he keeps digging would you please stop for a minute
what don t you get
im supposed to dig
he looks up supremely irritated and leans on the shovel
maggie coat d m y are you digging
isnt it obvious
what are you searching for
the question isnt what
we both know very well what even if we dont want to may it out loud
the question maggie which as you can plainly see i am very busy trying to answer the question is where
i think we should call the police
and tell them what exactly
run it by me once
practice see how it sounds
looks at his watch anything else
why dont you come in the house with me
take a break
i want to talk to you youre not yourself right now
this is just fucking typical isnt it
he climbs out of the hole and walks toward her
tom cont d what do you want me to do maggie you want me to go inside sit down in front of the tv drink eight or nine beers till
i fall asleep in the chair
maybe repeat the whole thing tomorrow and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after
and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after and the day after
until i grab my chest and die
may e i was already dead
this is the mos
important thing thats ever happaned to me the most important thins ive ever done in my life maggie my whole stupid life and you want me to just stop
by the and of his tirade two neighbors are staring over the back fence
hes only a few feet from maggie now the veins in his neck standing out
she holds her ground
ive known you since im nineteen years old you never talked to me like that before
not one time
he stares at her furious and then jumps in the hole and starts digging again
maggie turns and stalks across the yard and into the house
tom keeps digging for a moment then hurls the shovel across the yard
he picks up his tee shirt snakes angrily into it and marches across the yard toward the house
tom cant d to the neighbors what are you lookin at
maggie site at the kitchen table reading the letter that came in on the fax
tom comes into the room behind her pauses in the doorway composing himself
she keeps reading
he sighs heavily
she doesnt turn around
he goes to the refrigerator and takes out a carton of orange juice
he takes two glasses from a cupboard and sits down at the table opposite her
he fills both glasses and puts one in front of her
she looks up at him as he drains his
he pauses staring at her
you gonna drink that
she doesnt answer
he takes her glass drinks some
tom cone d im sorry
tom coat d okay im not sorry
she ignores him
he looks at the letter in her hands
tom cont d whos that from
my brother steve
my mothers going back in the hospital again
no sh he stops himself
she looks at him
he shakes his head
maggie cont d what
they stare at each other
toms face is pale
maggie is concerned
the phone rings
maggie stares at tom
the phone rings again
she lowers her voice pleading
what is it
tom cant look at her
the phone rings again
tom gets up opens the door that leads to the back yard and goes outside
tom takes a few steps out of the house putting his hands to his head in pain
whatever it is he knows
in the house the phone rings a fourth time
maggies voice drifts through the open doorway as she answers i
tom closes his eyes
steve i was just going to she stops
there is a long silence
tom opens his eyes
a tear runs down his cheek
he wipes it away
he turns and walks back toward the house slowly
there is dead silence inside
as he nears the doorway he hears the sound of the telephone being placed back in its cradle
maggie reaches the doorway at the same time tom does
she looks up at him her eyes filled with tears
he puts his arms around her and she breaks down
he holds her
he holds her for a long moment
maggie cont d you knew
no answer you knew didnt you
whens the funeral
we should leave as soon as we can
tom cont d oh you uh
you want me to go with you
she looks at him deeply hurt
she pushes him away from her hard
he stumbles back into the yard
tom cont d hey i just thought maybe you know
your family might want
do i want you to come with me
to my mothers funeral
of course l want you to come why the hell woullvt you come
but hes looking past her at the holes in the yard
kind of in the middle of something here
she looks at him absolutely incredulous and then storms back into the house slamming the door so hard two of the glass panes spiderweb
jake twisted around in his car seat looks out the back window of maggies car
he raises one hand waving
tom stands in the open doorway of the garage still in his mud stained jeans and tee shirt
he waves back
the car pulls out of the driveway fast and roars off down the block
jake and maggie are gone
there are now five large holes in the back yard and tom is running out of places to dig
nevertheless he drags the hose across the yard to an untouched patch of grass in the far corner
he stops short
hose wont reach
he unscrews the hose and carries it across the yard
this one in the far corner he reconnects the hose and turns on the water
nothing comes out
tom curses and trudges back toward the house
tom gets a screwdriver from a tool drawer in the kit hen
tom stomps into the dining room and goes to a closet on the far wall
he opens the door and tosses aside a carpet flap that covers the floor
he shoves the screwdriver into a crack in the floor and pries up a trap door two feet square in the middle of the closet floor
through the hole he can see a ladder resting up against the wall below
he feels for the rungs with his feet and starts to climb down
as tom climbs down he reaches out for a chain that hangs from a bare bulb in the ceiling and turns it on
they have only a partial basement a ten by ten foot space about eight feet deep
the rest of the area under the house is just crawl space barely enough to wriggle through
tom reaches the bottom and goes to the far side where a mess of water pipes all converge
he picks through them finds the valves that lead outside turns one off and another one on
water surges through the pipes headed out to the far spigot
he turns to climb back up the ladder
he looks down at the floor
he kicks at the dirt with his shoe thinking
the pick axe falls
tom has brought all his tools into the basement and is now digging in the middle of the basement floor
the bare bulb throws his exaggerated shadow on the earthen walls
its quiet in the neighborhood
the crunching sound of toms pick axe falling echoes over the block
the hole is almost four feet across five feet deep
hes uncovered a large rock a major chunk of stone right in the middle of where he wants to dig
hes excavated all around the edges of the thing and is trying to wedge it loose with a pry bar but it wont budge
tom collapses onto the floor leaning against the pile of mud and stone hes already hauled out
tom walks down an aisle along one wall in a huge yard supply warehouse
tools are mounted on the wall for sale shovels picks post hole diggers
got all that
tom keeps walking
the tools get bigger
hand pile drivers
almost but not quite
tom keeps walking
at the end of the row underneath a sign that says for rental only is an industrial size jackhammer the kind road crews use to bust through whatevers in their
toms face lights up
the jackhammer rides in the back of toms pickup truck rattling along as the truck bounces over potholes
tom pulls into his driveway comes around and drops the gate
using all his strength he wrestles the jackhammer out of the back of the truck
its incredibly heavy it takes all his strength to haul it up the stairs kick open his door and bring it into the house
lenny the neighborhood crank is washing his car
he hears a crash from over at toms place and turns
he sees tom at his pickup lugging a huge air compressor out of it
tom fights his way into the house with the compressor
lenny stares at him
sheila carrying flowers and looking like didnt sleep last night comes out of her house and heads for her car
she stops and stares too
in toms basement the compressor descends through the trap door above seemingly of its own accord than we see its at the end of a rope and tom is up
in the trap door space sweating and straining lowering the thing down
it settles on the floor next to the jackhammer
tom reaches up to the hanging light bulb which also has an electrical outlet in its fixture and plugs in a yellow safety cord
he flicks a switch on the compressor and it rattles to life
he follows a hose over to where it plugs into the side of the jackhammer which now quivers with unleashed power
tom picks up the jackhammer
he hauls it over to the rock thats been in his way
he positions the jackhammers spike on the top of the rock
he lowers a pair of goggles over his eyes
he swings his weight up onto the jackhammer and squeezes the handles
the jackhammer roars to life
toms whole body quivers
its like riding a bull but the rock begins to split in half
tom whoops with joy barely heard over the din that echoes in his basement
as the sun goes down the sound of the roaring jackhammer is plainly audible on the block
the familiar homeless guy stops and shouts something at toms house
across the street kurt damon comes out his front door and stares at toms house
what the hell is that guy up to
a group of people in dark clothes mill around a living room muttering in the soft tones of those at a wake
theres a lot of big irish guys drinking beer guts stuffed into sweat stained white shirts
maggie excuses herself from the group and steps into another room
the door is ajar people visible through it as maggie dials a nu rber on a bedside telephone
the phone rings on the other enc
just as shes about to hang up tom answers
sounds angry hello
changes his tone oh hi
how ya doin
hows your family
fighting with each other
listen maggie im sorry
i was an asshole
i should be there with you right now
yeah well what can i say

well i cant really

ill come down there and get you
ill leave right now
behind her the bedroom door swings open
jake stands there
he looks terrible
she doesnt hear him come in
no no no no no what do you want to do that for
dont come down here
maggie turns back to jake and gasps
hes peeing his pants the urine drizzling down over his shoes
into phone oh my god i gotta go
ill be there in an hour
maggie wait no mag she hangs up the phone and races over to her son
honey what happened
why didnt you tell me you had to go to the potty
jake turns and looks at her
tom slams down the phone
hes standing in the dining room which is now so mud spattered it looks like the inside of a cave
the table has been shoved against the wall legs sticking out into the room
one corner is filled with a pile of broken up chunks of rock
tom strides across the room in two steps lowers himself and drops his legs through the open trap door
tom sails down into the basement and lands nimbly on the floor
doesnt even use the ladder anymore
the rock is gone broken apart by the jackhammer and the hole is now eight feet long and as many wide and about four feet deep
tom leaps down into it and goes back to work
in the front hall of the house maggie is putting on her coat
jake sits on the steps his coat on the carpet next to him
jake come on we have to go
im staying here
i want to stay at uncle steves i dont want to go home
because im not safe there
because of the feathers
what does that mean jake
philip maggies brother stands in the doorway to the other room
its okay i can watch him
maggie in a hurry agrees
she bends over and kisses jake on the forehead
she opens the door and heads out
as its swinging shut dont stop for the train mommy
maggie hears that just as the door closes behind her
she misses a step thinking about it then starts walking to her car
she walks faster
then she runs
in the basement tom abruptly stops digging staring at the dirt
the corner of something shiny is sticking out from the pile
he bends down and pulls it out
its a piece of clear blue plastic sheeting about two inches square
toms hand starts to shake as he holds it
es through his mind again the one hes seen twice befoi
a face too close to his sting at him through that blurr blue like through bad eyeglasses
tom turns and leaps into the hole shovel in hand
he begins to dig wildly flinging dirt in all directions
at one end of the hole his shovel slips the dirt spilling off it as it sticks on something
tom drops the shovel
he falls to his knees and uses his hands to rake the dirt away from whatever it was
more blue plastic
tom tugs out about eight inches of the plastic gets a good grip on it with both hands
he pulls it up
like a rope pulled out of the sand the edge of the blue plastic rises up unearthing itself in a line down the middle of the pit
breathing hard tom grabs the shovel again
flies away from the plastic as tom works furiously
is of a man possessed
he digs as fast as he can
tom stands back staring down at what he has unearthed
above him we see what it is
a long piece of blue plastic wrapped around something about five and a half feet long and two and a half feet wide
tom bends down and lays one hand on the plastic
pops into his mind another familiar one
a figure in afl overcoat standing on the front porch of toms own house in winter waving to us to come up
tom jerks his hand off the plastic
he goes to hi toolbox and pulls out a utility knife
he slides the ra or blade forward
he goes to one and of the plastic bends down and jams the knife through the sheeting
he walks the length of it making a slit down the middle
he reaches out with shaking hands and pulls part of the plastic back
the first thing he sees is a partially decomposed human hand
around the withered wrist there are a half dozen multi colored bracelets
tom yanks the rest of the plastic away revealing the half decomposed body of samantha muller still in the black dress with the diamond pattern
tom stands there his chest heaving
he looks at her hand thinking
he sits down next to her
he reaches out for her hand then pulls his own back
cant do it
but hes gotta
he opens his hand reaching out for hers
he slides his hand underneath takes a deep breath and closes his living fingers around her skeletal ones
his face turns a horrible shade of pale his lips go ice blue and steam comes out of his mouth the way it did hers when he first saw her
in his living room
its a wintry day
that same steam rises up in front of us coming from our own mouth
were looking at the front porch of toms house as we walk past it
the house is being remodeled its surrounded by scaffolding its windows covered with plastic duvateen
the figure in the overcoat waves to us
off screen were in her point of vie sr hi
cmare a sec
i want to show you something
we look back over our shoulder then back at the figure
you mean me
this close now we see the figure is kurt damon
you want to show me something
her manner of speech is childish like a grade schoolers
well of course
i dont see anybody else around
we start up the steps of the porch
kurt smiles beguilingly and holds a hand out to us
what is it
its a surprise
what kind of surprise
well if i told you it wouldnt be much of a surprise would it
we let him pull us through the door
kurt leads us into the living room
the windows are covered with tinted plastic casting an eerie blue light through the place
adam mccarthy is in the living loom too drinking from a bottle of schnapps
hes drunk slurring
he sees us
whats the surprise
dont you have it
oh yeah the surprise
they laugh and look at each other
kurt drinks then forces the bottle back at adam
adam cant d im too wasted
drink motherfucker drink motherfucker drink motherfucker he wrestles with adam forcing him to drink
half of it runs down adams chin
i dont think there is a surprise
we turn and start for the door
kurt hurries around intercepts us
yeah there is yeah there is
he puts his arm around us leads us back into the room
kurt cont d the surprise is
we decided we want to be your friends
oh yeah so bad
why do you want to be my friend
are you kidding
look at yourself
kurt turns samantha toward an old mirror that hangs over the fireplace
shes good looking if she knew it
terribly insecure doesnt even like looking at herself
we turn away embarrassed
kurt coast d ah ah ah look
he makes us look in the mirror again
kurt cont d mama you are hot
he turns her toward him looks at her closely
kurt coast d come on lets be friends
you can kiss me if you want to
kurt leans in close kisses us
after a moment we force our head away looking down
kurts hand is on samanthas breast
we push him back
samantha contd not like that
but kurt pulls us closer roughly
come on samantha ill be your friend i swear i will
kurt cont d just be nice to me
be a good girl
youre a good girl arent you
i have to go home
we struggle some more
he gets his powerful hanis on our shoulders and starts to push us down
come on baby how bout a little helmet wash
his belt buckle comes into our view and his hands on it
we tear away get up and run for the door
from behind something hits us very hard
the floorboards race up at us all of a sudden
we land on them hard bounce off our own blood spraying out on the unfinished wood
our head lands sideways on the floor
we see adam mccarthy vomiting in the corner
abruptly were rolled over and are staring at the ceiling
kurt damon is on top of us his face too close
her hands rise up try to push him off but hes stronger
samantha starts to scream
hands close over our face
she bites and the hands are pulled away
she screams again
kurt cont d kurt holds her down begins to try to undress her
she writhes and screams
she gets one hand into kurts hair and pulls as hard as she can
he shouts in pain
in the corner adam mccarthy has his hands over his ears
but she keeps screaming
adam staggers to a boom box thats sitting on the fireplace mantle and flicks a switch
a song comes on loud
its a haunting tune we recognize it
sts the song jake has been humming
kurt continues his fumbling drunken attempts at rape tearing her hand out of his hair
adam lunges to the wall and tears down a sheet of the blts plastic duvateen
he races over to us with the sheet and everything turns blue
now our sights and sounds aye muffled and distorted through the blue plastic
we see the image that has haunted tom the face of kurt damon a blue demon as he grapples on top of us
tom is sprawled out beside the corpse their hands locked together
his color is cadaverous
back in samanthas point of view we struggle we thrash it seems to go on forever
slowly the sounds become fainter and fainter and fainter
and everything stops
we hear the muffled voices of kurt and adam screaming at each other
the sheet is ripped off
we stare up at them as kurt and adam stand above us chests heaving revolted looks on their faces looking at us like were a dog they just killed with
oh my god
what the fuck did you do that for
is she dead
no shit shes dead
oh my god
look at her tongue man
im not here
i never saw nobody dead before
we start to fall back and down as if sinking into the floor
kurt and adam grow taller further away
their voices fade
i wish i wasnt here
its fuckin gross
this isnt happening
fuckin plastic over her face
good thinkin adam
what do we do now
kurt and adam are very far away blobs of light at the end of a black tunnel thats closing in around us
just before everything goes completely black toms fingers twitch open and his hand pulls free of samanthas
he opens his eyes and gulps air
the color returns to his face as he pulls his hand away from hers
but as he does so he stops staring intently at something in her fingers
we dont see what it is
tom draws himself to his feet and climbs the ladder that leads upstairs
as he goes we pause looking between two rungs near the top of the ladder
in the darkened crawl space under the rest of the house a pair of eyes stare at us
its kurt damon
he twists around quickly and scoots back out under the house the way he came in
under the front porch a wood frame access panel lies on the grass next to the foundation of toms house where it has been removed
kurt damon wriggles out from under the house and comes onto the grass
but the sound of the front door of toms house opening sends him scurrying back into the shadows
toms feet come down the steps and head off across the driveway
a moment later kurt darts out fromhis hiding place and hurries across the street toward his own house
om nearing the front steps of franks house next door thought he heard something
he turns back but kurt is gone
tom climbs the steps to franks house
bouquets of flowers have been left here and there on the steps along with a few candles and handwritten signs hang in there adam we love you that sort of
tom knocks on the front door
a moment later frank opens it
he looks devastated shell shocked his eyes sunken from crying
hes wearing a red shirt weve seen before
hows he doin
cant talk much
he might make it
sheilas over there now im headed back
frank im sorry
im sorry because
i think i know why adam shot himself
and i have to call the police about it
but i dont want you to hear it from them i dont want sheila to read it in the paper
you have the right to know before anybody else
what are you talking about
come with me
he nods toward his own house
frank stares at him frightened but what could possibly be worse than whats already happened
hang on a second
he turns and heads into the house
a few moments later he reappears carrying his jacket
tom leads him across the driveway
the damon house is visible across the street
one by one the lights flick on in its windows
he and frank reach the steps of his house and start up
frank cont d this better be important
tom doesnt answer just opens the door and gestures for frank to go first
in the damon garage hands scramble frantically through drawers and come up with a handgun
now the hands find a box of bullets shake them out onto a workbench
the hands load the gun
tom closes and locks the front door
frank looks at him well
tom leads him toward the dining room
in the damon house the same hands pull on a pair of leather gloves
the gloved hands screw the top off a bottle of bourbon raise the bottle to lips that drink heavily
frank reacts to the ruined dining room
he looks at tom
what the hell is goin on around here
tom goes to the trap door and lowers himself halfway through
the gloved hands carry the bottle of bourbon into the damon living room still under construction
the hands raise the bottle and offer it
to kurt damon
harry his father is the one wearing the gloves
kurt looks terrified
you got thisstarted youre god damn well gonna help finish it
kurt takes the bottle and drinks
he starts to lower it but his father forces him to drink more and more until he nearly retches
tom and frank stand on opposite sides of the grave staring down at the corpse of samantha muller
frank is horrified
how did you find this
does it matter
you dont know it was adam and kurt
but theres nothing to
youre talking like a nut thats what people will say
this is just a body it doesnt prove anything
no it doesnt
he bends down and lifts samanthas lifeless hand
he pries open her fingers
shes clutching a tuft of hair
tom cont d but this probably will
frank stares for a long moment struck dumb
finally he turns his back
his shoulders heave as he cries silently
in the misty night the figures of harry and kurt damon come out of their house and skulk across the street toward toms
maggie drives as fast as she can
up ahead red lights flash and gates fall in front of a set of railroad tracks
cars are stopped waiting for it
maggie pulls to a stop at the back of the line then thinks better of it
she drops the car in gear hauls it around the others and bolts for the tracks
the train nearly upon her blares its horn
maggie flies across the tracks and slams through the gate on the other side a split second before the train hurtles through the intersection behind her
she cuts it hard to the right to miss the waiting cars on the other side and pulls it back on the road
she drives on shaking like a leaf
frank is still sobbing his back to tom
tom takes a step toward him to comfort him
frank we have to i mean what were we supposed to do
frank cont d the kids come to us shes already dead the damage is done theres nothin gonna bring her back
but those boys theyve got everything ahead of them
frank lets his jacket drop to the floor revealing his right hand
hes holding the with the carved white handle
he turns and looks at tom
frank coast d what were we supposed to do
send our boys to jail for the rest of their lives
our own flesh and blood
hairy and kurt damon reach the front steps of toms house
they look up and down the block
theres no one out
no one to see
frank still has the gun hanging at his side tears streaming down his cheeks
who you planning to shoot with that
who do you think
i think you havent decided yet
hes right and frank knows it
get out of here
what are you gonna do frank
frank raises the gun in a fury
frank i wont go until you frank aims the gun just to the left of toms head and pulls the trigger
the bullet cracks off the ladder
tom starts up the ladder
tom crawls out the trap door and hurries out of the dining room
tom races ak
ross the living room scoops hi truck keys off the desk opens the front door and finds himself face to face with harry damon and his son kurt
harry slugs tom in the face with the butt end of the gun
tom falls to the floor moaning
they step inside quickly closing the door behind them
they dont speak
kurt starts to drag tom who is still stunned across the living room floor
harry pulls a folded sheet of blue plastic from inside his jacket and spreads it out on the carpet
kurt drags tom into the middle of the plastic and drops him there
tom is staring up at them starting to regain his senses
tom regaining his strength starts to struggle but kurt puts his knee in the middle of
toms back and pulls his head back
kurt is blubbering hysterical
harry con t d harry pulls the gun from his belt and raises it putting it to the back of toms head
but then he lowers it his hand shaking so hard he can barely hold onto it
he works up his nerve harry contd raises the gun again puts it to the back of toms head cocks it
and a spray of headlights splashes across the far wall of the room
outside they hear k car pull into the driveway and park
the engine shuts off
kurt looks at his father panicked
harry looks down at tom
tom closes his eyes and prays
maggie pulls the keys from the ignition and gets out of the car
she walks toward the house looking anxiously around the neighborhood
as she reaches the steps the light in the living room window abruptly clicks off
she starts forward again slowly
now the porch light clicks off
its real dark
maggie digs the car keys out of her pocket and feels for something on the key chain
something thats not there
she starts up the stairs
she reaches the top
the last light that was on inside clicks off
now the house is totally black inside
remembering something she pulls her purse around and feels inside it
she finds the butterfly knife the one she found in toms pants
she holds it in her left hand keys in her right
she goes to the door
she unlocks the deadbolt
inside she hears a scurrying sound
she unlocks the knob
she puts the keys back in her purse
she switches the knife to her right hand keeping it closed concealed
she opens the door
the room is pitch black so b aggie leaves the door hanging open
some light spills in from the street
she steps inside and fumbles for a light switch
she flicks it
maggie cont d are you here
she crosses the room to another light and clicks its switch
as the light floods the room harry who was hiding behind the front door bangs it shut
kurt damon is still kneeling on toms back holding one hand roughly over his mouth trying to keep him quiet
maggie contd harry raises the gun in his hand and points it at maggie
she lunges toward tom but harry grabs her by the arm and flings her roughly to the ground
tom takes advantage of the moment to flip kurt off his back
as the kid flies harry whirls training the gun on tom
but tom tries to scramble to his feet
harry starts to squeeze the trigger and screams in agony
looking down he sees maggie has plunged the knife into his thigh
she rips it out and plunges it in again
harrys arm flies up the gun goes off and the bullet rips through the ceiling
on the second floor in jakes bedroom which jake is not in the bullet cracks up through the floorboards tears through his mattress and bursts through the little boys pillow
the pillow explodes in a cloud of fea hers which fly everywhere
tom crawls over to maggie and grabs hold of her putting himself between her and harry who still has the gun
over at the fireplace kurt damon pulls the poker out of its holder
harry aims the gun
kurt lunges forward with the poker
two shots ring out from the doorway to the dining room
harry clutches his chest and drops to the floor
they all turn
frank stands in the doorway to the dining room clutching his
kurt rushes toward him screaming poker raised high
frank pulls the trigger two more times
kurt goes down
tom huddles over her
frank lets the weapon slip from his fingers
it hits the hardwood with a clatter
tom and maggie look up
frank looks at them
in that red shirt he is exactly the image tom saw of him in his dream
they were gonna kill you tommy
you and maggie both
frank turns and walks to the front door
he opens it walks out onto the porch and sits down on the top step facing the street
tom looks at maggie
theyre both in shock can hardly speak
maggie nods shaking
tom cont d you saved me
baby im alive be ause of you
they hold each other
tom comes out of the house
frank sitting on the top porch step makes no attempt to flee
tom sits down beside him
from all around the block voices are starting to rise up did you hear that
what the hell
somebody call a cop
frank shakes his head
cold blooded murder
i cant let something like that happen
he looks at tom
frank con t d this is a decent neighborhood
a few tentative faces gather across the street staring at toms house wondering what the hell
a siren wails in the distance
i thought so frank
i sure as hell always thought so
a newborn baby stares up at us from inside a rolling bassinet
the bassinet is wheeled swiftly down a hospital corridor by a nurse
its a long trip wherever its going but the baby waits patiently staring up at the ceiling eyes open
above the baby the lights streak by white blurs
the nurse leans down and looks at the baby
to the baby shes just a fuzzy blob
the baby turns and looks sideways
the doors of the hospital rooms whiz by brown smears
nurse cont d just around this corner
she rolls the bassinet around a corner and toward one or in particular
the baby sees a bunch of shapes inside the room
maggie who has recently given birth struggles to sit up in bad as the nurse rolls the bassinet into the room
tom grinning gets up from the chair hes sitting in with jake
meet the family
she picks up the baby and holds her out to maggie who takes her eagerly
hi baby did you sleep well
i sure didnt
the baby sees maggies face blurry but friendly
tom leans in
so youre the one thats been kicking my wife
the baby sees toms blurry face
jake steps up onto a step stool so he can see over the edge of the bed
let me see let me see
maggie turns the baby so shes facing jake
the infant looks at her older brother
at first his face is as blurry as everybody elses
but slowly jakes face becomes crystal clear even though everything around him stays out of focus
jake cont d can i hold her
if youre very very careful
climb up here
jake climbs up on the bed
maggie puts some pillows around him and carefully places the baby in his lap
jake looks down at the infant
his expression becomes very serious
gently he reaches out with one hand and puts his fingertips on the babys forehead the same way he did to toms forehead that first night
the baby and jake stare at each other for a long moment
so long in fact that the adults become uncomfortable
certainly get along dont they
suddenly jake breaks into a wide grin and looks up at his parents thrilled
then he looks back at his sister
he leans down and whispers softly in her ear
dont be afraid of s t
tom and maggie look at each other
