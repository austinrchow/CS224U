written by tom holland sep th
clouds obscure the starless heavens for a moment heavy and ominous in the black firmament
then suddenly they clear exposing a full moon streaked with red like a killers face a stalking moon staring down at mans evil on the earth below
a howl breaks the night a wolf pursuing its prey perhaps or perhaps something much much worse
voices break the perfect stillness
what was that
just a child of night jonathan
come sit here beside me on the veranda
its chilly out here
oh no it isnt
i love the night so
a middling size town lost somewhere in the southwest the lights of its sixty some thousand residents twinkling like so many christmas lights in the night
ive never seen you so beautiful before nina
so pale so luminescent so he suddenly stops
there is a moment
your lips are so red
would you like to kiss them
the camera starts to push in closer and closer on the town as though searching for the source of the voices
its a typical middle class suburban street full of pre world war ii houses the substantial places they built then two and three story homes with attics and basements
porches and detached garages
there is the sound of a long drawn out kiss as jonathan and miss ninas lips meet
moves down the street still looking for the voices
the camera pauses to stare at the dandrige house so dif ferent in look and feel from all the other houses on the street
its huge almost forboding its windows dark and vacant its lawn overgrown and weed infested a home that has obviously been untended for a long time unlived in and uncared
however the for sale on the lawn has a sold sign just beneath it
the camera pans to the brewster house next door still searching for those voices
its in sharp contrast to the dandrige house newly painted its lawn neatly shorn a house almost dwarfed in comparison to the dandrige house but a happy home its windows
lit and smiling out warmly at the night
the voices seem to be coming from the brewster house spe cifically from a dark second story window that is open to the night breeze
why are you looking at me so strangely nina
not you jonathan
has anyone ever told you it was beautiful
come lay your head on my breast
the camera slowly starts to push in on the second
the camera moves through the window past the billowing drapes to find itself staring at a tv the flickering screen the only light in the room
one of those terrible aip hammer horror films is on the tube a woman obviously a vampire talking to one of those vapid juveniles used so much in these types
of films the two of them standing on a veranda to some huge old house
the young man rests his head against her breast incredibly enough unaware that she is bending toward his neck with these huge fangs
she is about to sink them into his jugular a tall saturnine man steps out of the darkness
wearing a rather daffy victorian suit and carrying a stake and mallet in his hand
his name is peter vincent
stop you creature of the night
the vampiress leaps to her feet her hapless intended victim forgotten
she faces peter with a hiss her fangs sparkling in the moonlight
who are you who interrupts my nightly feeding
drawing himself up to his full height peter vincent vampire killer
he rushes her the stake held high to plunge into her breast and the camera turns away from the tv as the sounds of the movie cross fade with the
sounds of heavy breathing lips meeting tongues intertwining in the room itself
only the room a typical teenagers lair seems devoid of life the bed empty schoolbooks untouched sitting on the desk
the camera begins to search the room looking for the source of this new sound much more interesting than the old flick on the tube
and then it finds them charley brewster and amy petersen two sixteen year olds on the floor to the far side of the bed wedged between the bed and the
they are both as american as their jeans and making out like crazy
t and turn on the floor amy alternating between enjoy ing it and fighting charley off both of them white hot with their mutual need
as he tries to slip his hand under her blouse she catches a glimpse of the tv
the horror movie has faded out to be replaced by the interior of a local tv studio a tacky graveyard set the centerpiece the visage of peter vincent much older
now rising out of a papier mache coffin and filling the screen as credits end
this is peter vincent bringing you fright night theatre
tonights journey into horror is blood castle one of my favorites
and for a very good season
i star in it
he does this booming laugh that goes through about ten echo chambers as charley totally oblivious to the tv works on amys bra trying to get it undone obviously something
she doesnt want
she tries to distract him
charley peter vincents on
fumbling with the bra forget peter vincent
but you love him
i love you more behind them the station break segues into a commercial a bunch of kids singing and dancing joyfully to a coca cola commercial
on the floor charley finally gets amys bra undone
thats it for her she twists away
charley stop it
be doesnt listen going for her again their finger fight ing behind her back hers trying to get the bra resnapped his trying to keep it undone and get her
blouse off at the same time
she suddenly pushes him away really hard this time
charley i said stop it
charley rolls over leaping to his feet frustrated as hell
jesus give me a break amy
weve been going together almost a year and all i hear is charley stop it
they stare at each other angrily both of them breathing hard their young hormones roiling inside them
then they look away not wanting to see the others anger staring at the tv for lack of any better place to look
the horror movie is on again peter vincent and jonathan now carrying a coffin across a fog swept cemetery
charley looks back at amy his features softening
im sorry amy
she rises both of them standing by the open window staring at each other
she puts a hand out touching his arm im just scared thats all
he nods understandingly touched by her honesty and inno cence his basic decency winning out over his lust
sud denly she steps into his arms kissing him as she never has before
she breaks staring up into his face nervously
lets get into bed
staring at her stunned you mean it
she nods stepping into his arms again kissing him like hes never been kissed before the two of them slowly turn ing charley seeing the tv first with its grave
digger scene then the wall and finally out the window over amys shoulder
and he freezes
there below in the side yard he sees two shadowy figures carrying what looks very much like a coffin toward the storm doors to the dandrige house next door
his mouth drops open as amyaslips out of his arms and onto the bed completely unaware of what hes seeing
she starts to take off her blouse charley no longer looking at her his gaze glued to the weird scene hes seeing out his window
as her blouse comes off she lays back in the bed looking up at him waiting for him to join her
charley im ready
he ignores her grabbing his binoculars from his desk whipping
them to his eyes and focusing in on the figures below
theyre too dark to make out clearly but they are jerry dandrige and billy cole
an errant beam of moonlight hits the large oblong box and charley gasps
its a beautiful piece of work huge ornate obviously incredibly old and bound in brass
amy stares at charley with rising confusion and irritation
charley i said im ready
still glued to his amy youre not going to believe this but there are two guys in the yard below
and i think theyre carrying a coffin
glancing at the tv and seeing the very same scene sure and theyre on the moors right
amy im serious
so am i
do you want to make love or not
charley is still peering through the binoculars the two figures below having gotten the storm doors open and now carrying the coffin into the basement of the house next door
amy quick come here youve got to see this
all he hears is his bedroom door slamming shut
he whirls to find amy gone
tossing the binoculars on the bed he dives after her
charley hurries down the stairs after her
okay maybe it wasnt a coffin but i did see two guys carrying something into that house ch rev
i dont understand you
first you want to make love then you dont they reach the bottom of the stairs only to have a voice from the living room stop them
amy charley whats wrong
they stop turning to stare through the doorway at charleys mom judy brewster sitting in the living room watching the ten oclock news on the downstairs tv
shes a young forty pleasant looking and warm
amy steps into the living room charley following the two of them trying to pull themselves together so charleys mother wont notice what theyve been doing upstairs
have you two been having a lovers spat
embarrassed as hell no mom nothing like that
well theres nothing wrong with that
pointing at the maga zine in her lap right here it says the divorce rate is higher among couples who dont argue before marriage
mom were in high school
oh yes thats right
well it never hurts to plan ahead
tell your mother i said hello will you amy
and remind her were playing bridge at her house this week
im bringing the cheesepuffs shes making the dessert
good night charley
but hes no longer listening hes moving toward the window that stares out at the house next door
there are lights on in the first floor
behind him amy turns back to his mother
well good night mrs
good night amy
and thanks for helping charley
see you tomorrow charley
be hardly hears her staring out the window
miffed again amy turns and stomps out of the room the front door heard slamming behind her a moment later
judy turns to her son to see whats wrong with him
hes glued to the window staring at the house next door
charley that wasnt very nice not walking amy to the front door
hardly hearing her mom there are people
oh the new owner must
be moving in
what new owner
didnt i tell you
bob hopkins told me he finally sold the place
some fellow who fikes up houses he said
supposed to be attractive too
anyway i just hope whoever he is he knows what hes getting into with that house
its going to take a lot of work just to make it liveable and the camera leaves them behind slowly pushing in tighter and tighter on the tv judy was
watching their voices fading out to be taken over by the newscaster dron ing away on the screen
and now for the local news
a man was found murdered tonight behind the railroad yards
details are pending waiting notification of next of kids are flooding out of the classrooms the bell having just rung
charley comes out of one of them holding a test paper and looking none too happy about it
why didnt he tell us he was going to spring a pop quiz
another kid comes out right behind him holding a test paper with a big a on it
eis name is evil ed thompson and hes tall and thin with a terrible complexion and a personality to match
thats the point to a pop quiz brewster
to surprise you
charley glances up at that moment to see amy walking by her head held high and looking in every direction but his
hey amy she keeps right on going disappearing into the crowd
evil ed throws a look at charley and cackles
she finally found out what youre really like
buzz off evil
call me anything you want
only youre the one failing algebra not me
with another high pitched laugh he walks off leaving charley staring after amy miserably
charley pulls his red beater mustang into the driveway
he gets out carrying his schoolbooks and heads for the front door
just as he bends down to pick up the evening paper on the walk a cab pulls up and a young woman gets out
charley stops cold she is definitely one of the most spec tacular girls hes ever seen obviously sexy cheap around the edges but no less spectacular for it
she looks at him like a little girl lost
is this ninety nine oak
pointing to the no next door
she nods her head in thanks and walks toward the next door house the one
where he saw the two men carrying what looked to be a coffin into the basement
its a three story house like charleys but there any similarity ends
the brewster house is newly painted and well lived in the dandrige house has long been abandoned the lawn overgrown paint flecking from its side the entire place rundown and
charley watches the girl disappear into the dandrige house whistling appreciatively under his breath
he turns for his own front door
charley enters the kitchen to find his mother preparing dinner
he hands her the evening paper
charley stops by the kitchen sink staring out at the dandrige house
as his mother goes back to fixing dinner
mom you seen the new guy next door yet
no but i did hear hes got a live in carpenter
with my luck hes probably gay
no i dont think so
why what do you know that i dont
got to study
see you later
he cuts a beeline for the door his mother staring after him disbelievingly as he disappears out the door
hes hard at work at his desk really into his algebra when over his shoulder a light comes on behind the drawn shade of the bedroom window of the house
it is directly on a sightline with his own room but he doesnt see it staring intently at his books
suddenly a womans scream high pitched and terrified shatters the night
charley whirls sending his books crashing to the floor staring out his window at the lit window in the house next
the light snaps out dark ness blanking the entire wall of the dandrige house
charley just stares at it trying to repress a shiver all thoughts of studying algebra suddenly gone
its the after school hangout a bunch of tables before a fast food joint on the fourth floor of a shopping mall
kids mill about nearby video game machines going full blast a tv playing the young and the restless on the counter
charley sits at one of the tables almost falling asleep face down in his cheeseburger and fries as he tries to study
suddenly amy slips in beside
looking up at her hi
look im really sorry about the other it was my fault not yours
he recovers taking her hand look amy i
want to fight with you again okay
breaking into a big smile god im so glad were getting this straightened out
ive been miserable the last two days
you dont know what its been over her shoulder he suddenly sees that the tv has gone to the local news a picture of a girl who looks very much
like the one he saw going into the dandrige house the afternoon before on the screen
he is suddenly no longer listening or looking at amy his complete attention on the tv
she trails off as she realizes shes lost his atten tion staring at him
charley are you listening to me
he gets up abruptly and walks away leaving her sitting there staring after him
he stopsbelow the tv staring up at it as the newscasters voice runs over the picture of the girl
cheryl lane a known prostitute was found murdered this morning evil ed steps up beside him staring up at the screen along with him
know what i heard on the police band last night
nodding at the tv that wasnt the only murder
its the second in two days
and get this
both of em had their heads cut off
can you believe it
staring at him youre sick
a voice suddenly comes from behind him
td the two houses sit there side by side
only the dandrige house has changed although its hard to say exactly how
it just seems worse than before more abandoned more hulk ing more
charley has the house next door staked out
he sits in a chair before his window all the lights off in his room only the flickering tv to keep him company
its peter vincent on fright night another one of his films on this time the volume turned off
charley holds his binoculars in his hand staring at the dark window of the house next door waiting
the tv is just flickering snow now the channel having signed off hours before
charley still sits in front of his window but hes sound asleep breathing deeply lost in his dreams
soft sensual music snakes through his open window enveloping him slowly and dragging him awake
groggily he opens his eyes to find himself staring into the lit window of the bedroom next door
he sits up with a start
there is no drawn shade now
be can see clearly into the room and a beautiful teenage girl with long blonde hair stands there framed in the window slowly taking her blouse off
charley rubs his eyes
hardly able to believe what hes seeing
as he watches she drops the blouse to the floor and stands there bare breasted
charley gulps fumbling for his binoculars
he gets them to his eyes just as jerry dandrige steps out of the shadows behind the girl gliding across the room toward her with incredible grace
to charley the whole thing has
a dreamlike quality jerry more an impression than a reality
hes thirty maybe almost beautiful with alabaster skin and chestnut hair
he stops behind the girl sweeping her hair back exposing her tender young neck
he slowly leans down as though to kiss her
as charley watches through his binoculars unable to tear his eyes away jerry dandriges upper lip slowly begins to pull back
revealing just the hint of fangs long razor sharp and sparkling pearly white in the moonlight
suddenly jerry dandrige stops the fangs poised an inch above the girls throat
he slowly raises his head star ing out the window across the side yard and into charleys bedroom
its almost as though he can see the boy watching him
with an involuntary gasp of terror charley steps back into the deeper darkness of his room his hand instinctively reaching up to protect his own throat
jerry dandrigeaslowly reaches up and pulls down the shade cutting off all view into the room
charley stands there for a moment unable to believe what he just saw
the binoculars slip from his hand crashing to the floor and
he whirls racing out of the room
he bursts through the door to find his mother sound asleep in bed
he grabs her shaking her awake
morn youve yot to get up
i cant believe what s happening next door
staring up as her son what what are you talking about
he has fangs
the man who bought the house has fanas
oh charley i have to be at work at he hears a car door slam in the yard next door
he jumps to the window peering out into the back of the dandrige house just in time to see billy cole walking away from a shiny new black cherokee jeep
its back door left open
charley whirls and dashes out of the room leaving his mother staring after him
he races down the corridor for the stairway landing
he pounds down the stairs takingthem two at a time whips around the newel post and flies down the hall toward the kitchen
charley slips out his back door and through
the darkness into the adjoining yard
there among a clump of bushes he crouches down watching the black jeep
the rear door is open as though to receive some burden the yard empty billy cole no longerthere
suddenly the back door to the dandrige house opens again and billy comes out carrying a large bundle in a plastic trash bag over his shoulder
charleys mouth falls open as he realizes the bundle couldeasily be a womans dead body
billy dumps it in the back of the jeep and slams the door crossing
in front of the vehicle for the drivers door
suddenly there is a terrific whooshthrough the air over charleys head the moonlight momentarily blotted out the beating of large wings above causing the bushes around him to bend and
its almost as though a huge bird a bat perhaps just swooped over his head from the top floor of the dandrige house
and then silence returns
charley lifts his head peering about in the darkness just in time to see a shape more a shadow than a man step out of the darkness no more than
ten feet away
its jerry dandrige
he glides toward the jeep tossing billy a womans purse
here you forgot this
billy one hands it out of the air turning back for the jeep
just then the back door to charleys house bangs open sending a shaft of light into the darkness
judy brewster stands there in the doorway calling to her son
e and billy cole freeze both of them turning to look at the back door to the brewster house inadvertently staring right at the clump of bushes where charley
is hid ing
dandrige takes a step forward his eyes probing the dark ness as though he can actually see through the murky black ness right to where charley hides
terrified charley suddenly leaps to his feet and races back into his own yard disappearing through the back door with his mother
billy steps forward as though to follow the boy
jerry puts out a restraining hand stopping him
charley sits at the kitchen table his mother putting a cup of hot cocoa into his hand
here drink this
mom i dont need hot cocoa
i didnt have a nightmare
they did kill a girl over there
feeling his forehead for a fever charley how late did you stay up studying
shoving her hand away imom im not sick
the guy did have fangs and a bat did fly over my head and then jerry dandrige stepped out of the shadows
you know what that means dont you
staring at him worriedly what
hes a vam re
staring at him a what
amys staring at him much as his mother did with a look of shock and total disbelief on her face
frustrated as hell a vampire damnit
havent you listened to anything ive said
charley is this some kind of trick to get me back
turning toward the door in disgust i forget it lm going to the police
blocking his path charley you cant go to the police with a story like that
theyll lock you up
all right then i wont tell them its a vampire
but i sure as hell am going to tell them about the two women be slams out the back door leaving her staring after him t worried sick
a police car pulls up charley in a red mustang behind him
he gets out walking to meet lieutenant detective lennox a tall man in his early
he hitches his pants staring at the teenager hard
you sure about this now
charley nods emphatically and the cop turns toward the house charley following
the knock reverberates through the silent house
nothing for several seconds then the sound of someone walking down the hall from the kitchen
billy cole appears stopping before the door staring through the curtain at the dim outline of charley and the detective standing on the porch
he opens the door staring at the boy and the cop
no im his roommate abilly cole
flashing his badge lieutenant lennox homicide
mind if we come in
no not at all
he steps back from the door allowing them to enter
the house is a mess of cardboard moving boxes and heavy victorian furniture scattered everywhere a number of the pieces still under white dust covers
clocks line one wall none of them working all set at p
is there anything i can help you with
there was a murder last night
charley livesnext door and thinks he saw the victim in this house
i was here with jerry all last night
there was nobody else in the house
thats a lie
nodding at billy i saw him carry her body out in a plastic bag
what do you say to that mr
the kids crazy officer
i did take some bags out last night but they were full of trash
here let me show you he leads them into the living room which isa mess of pack ing crates boxes and furniture
he holds up a plastic trash bag stuffed with wrapping paper and cardboard boxes
were just in the process of moving in the bag i saw had a body in it not trash
did you actually see the body charley
look let me take you out back
show you the bags i put in the garbage
okay lets see em he takes a step to follow billy out of theroom when charley increasingly desperate stops him
look i can prove hes lying
lets look in the basement instead
whats down there
turning and staring yes charley whats down there
charley meets the big mans gaze and finds his tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth
the seconds tick past
still nothing from charley
billy turns to the lieutenant with a smile
obviously the boys made a mistake bursting out with it a coffin thats whats down there a coffin
i saw them carry it in
almost slamming charley up against the car now you listen to me kid
if i ever see your ass down at the station house again im throwing it in jail
he hops in his car slamming the door behind him as charley hovers by the window
lieutenant lennox please listen to lennox ignores him roaring away in a cloud of burning rubber
charley stares after him not knowing what to do now
he hears the porch door of the dandrige house open behind him and whirls to find himself staring at billy cole standing on the porch looking back at him a
toothpick in his mouth
theres something very unpleasant in the big mans eyes like murder
charley slowly backs away from him toward his car coles eyes following him
charley glances down at his wrist watch
its four in the afternoon
he glances up at the sun overhead
its beginning to sink late afternoon and all that implies drawing nigh
he looks back at billy cole
the man is smiling at him now reading his thoughts
charley leaps into his car and takes off down the street
charley bursts through the front door and pounds up the stairs yelling as he comes
evil ed sits at his desk
hand painting a monster model of a ghoul as charley bursts through the door and skids to a halt before him breathing hard
evils room is a veritable museum of horror movie posters of frankenstein and the wolfman dotting the wall the shelves full of monsters models the floor littered with horror comics
evil glances up at charley
obviously not happy about being disturbed
and to what do i owe this dubious pleasure
the vampire knows that i know about him
or at least he will when he wakes up tonight
what are you talking about
ive got a vampire living next door and hes going to kill me if i dont protect myself
looking at him like what
look evil i havent got time to explain
just tell me what to do to protect myself
going back to his very funny brewster
im not kidding
evil please just tell me what to do
why should i help you
and dont call me that
digging money out of look ive got eight bucks
tell me what to do and it s yours
evil ed stares at the money for a moment and then sweeps it into his
far be it from me to turn down a fools money
where and when do you expect this vampire to attack
in my bedroom
evil ed puts down his brush and pulls a dime store cross from his desk
he hands it to charley
start with this
of course you have to have faith for it to work
then get some wolfbane what
get some garlic links of the stuff you can wear around your neck and hang from your window
if he comes for you thatll be the way
then of course theres holy water
but you need a priest to say a blessing over it first
he goes back to his painting
charley stares at him
im afraid so
of course they can change into wolves and bats at will and i dont know what you do about that
but your best protection right now is that a vampire cant enter your house without being invited by the rightful owner first
you sure about that
charley steps back to stare at his window finished at last
bes done the best he can nailing it shut strewing it with garlic his chest of drawers shoved in front of it partially blocking
the cross evil ed gave him sits on his desk
he tests the window
his mother calls up to him from the portico below
charley come down here please
theres someone i want you to meet
he turns and walks out of the room feeling better now
portico stairway night he bounces down the stairs and turns toward the door to the living room
he walks into the living room to find his mother standing there a drink in her hand
yeah mom charley this is
our next door neighbor jerry dandrige
jerry dandrige sits in the best chair a drink in his hand smiling at charley
hes even better looking close up almost blindingly beautiful too much so actually
theres something disturbing about it as though such good looks have to cover up an inner putrefaction some sort of hidden sweet sickly rot just beneath the perfect pale skin
he rises the smile widening as he sees the terror in charleys eyes
he holds his hand out as judy watches her son for his reaction
charley just stares at him
well shake hands charley
theres no reason to be rude
charley slowly crosses to jerry and takes his hand shaking it as one would the hand of a recently disinterred corpse
smiles pleased with herself
whats he doing here
rising and smiling i invited him over for a drink
stone cold horrified you what
a bit taken aback by the intensity of her invited him over
charley turns back to stare at jerry
jerry smiles speak ing in a voice that flows like honey charm and nascent sensuality oozing from his every pore
whats wrong charley
afraid id never come over without being invited first
youre quite right
but of course now that ive been made welcome ill probably drop by quite a bit
his voice changes suddenly charged with double meaning his eyes burning into charley
in fact anytime i feel like it
changing tack turn ing back to judy with your mothers kind permission of course
of course jerry
youre welcome anytime
its so nice someone interesting has finally moved into the neighborhood
its so dull around here
i mean how many nights can you play trivial pursuit
charley watches this scene backing across the room terri fied
he suddenly hits an end table knocking it with a crash to the floor
judy looks at him
hes ghost white
are you all right
his eyes on jerry as he backs for the door yeah fine
ive just got to get back to my trigonometry thats
nice meeting you charley
his voice suddenly dripping with double see you soon
and unseen by judy he looks directly at charley and winks at him
charley whirls bolting out of room and pounding up the stairway out of sight
judy turns to jerry
you know our town really isntas boring as i make it sound
for instance theres a dance at the church the first friday of every month
jerry smiles a secret smile and takes a sip of his drink
be bursts through the door and scoops up the phone punch ing out a number frantically
he is still at work painting the monster model of the ghoul
the phone rings
he picks it up
the vampire is in the house
my idiot mother just invited him over for a drink
starting to laugh no shit
ed this is serious
you still have mycross
yeah and i nailed my
theres no way he can get to you
now good night
ive got some studying to do
he hangs up returning to painting his monster model of the ghoul mumbling to himself
charley grabs the cross off his desk and nervously fingers it turning to stare out his window at jerrys window next door
the shade is pulled but theres a light on behind it
it doesnt make charley any less nervous
both houses sit quietly on the street wrapped in the dark ness of the night air
an ordinary enough image two houses sitting there but theres something disturbing about it
a few seconds one realizes what it is the dandrige house almost looks like its about to pounce on its next door neighbor the brewster house
judy is sound asleep a light breeze wafting the curtains
of her partially open window sleeping mask over her eyes
darkness and silence and nothing else but moonlight spill ing through the window at the far end
he sleeps fitfully in his chair his door locked behind him his window barricaded with his desk
suddenly the shadowy outline of
what might be a huge bat swoops past the window outside followed by the beating of mighty wings
a second later something is heard landing on the roof with a heavy thud
charley sits bolt upright in his bed as he hears it lis tening hard
but now theres nothing but silence
he stares up at the ceiling listening and waiting
then he hears what sounds lire footsteps walking across the roof
and then silence again
grabbing the cross and holding on to it tightly he walks toward his door
he unlocks the door and pokes his head out looking up and down the hall
then he hears it a noise from the floor below
it sounds like fingernails scratching
he tiptoes to the landing staring down at the shadow enshrouded portico below
the noise is louder now spookier more insistent
clutching his cross he starts down the stairs
jerry dandrige stands above judy staring down at her sleeping peacefully in her bed
the window behind him is now fully open
he glides across the room past judys bureau with her wigs sitting on it past the wall mirror without leaving a reflection to mark his passing and out the door
with unnatural silence
jerry closes the door behind him giving it a sharp tug that slightly dislodges it from it hinges wedging it
tight against the frame
its something no man of ordinary strength could accomplish that easily
he turns away gliding across the hall toward the open door to charleys bedroom
charley stands on the stairs staring through the doorway into the living room
there is nothing but shadows in there
and then he sees it the source of the scratching sound
a tree branch caressed by the wind is slowly
moving back and forth across a pane of glass in one of the french doors to the patio
relieved charley slips the cross into his pants pocket and turns walking back up the stairs
he walks down the hall past his mothers bedroom hardly giving it a glance as he disappears into his own room
be shuts the door softly behind him locking it sits turns on the tv rising again nervously and
turns to find himself facing jerry dandrige
be opens his mouth to scream
the vampires hand whips out with blinding speed and seizes him by the throat choking off all sound
now we wouldnt want to wake your mother would we charley
then id have to kill her too
charley nods and jerry flings the boy the length of the room with inhuman strength slamming him into the far wail
charley slips to the floor all the air knocked out of him
jerry advances onhim as charley fights to get his breath back
do you realize the trouble youve caused me
spying on me almost disturbing my sleep this afternoon telling policemen about me he reaches down and grabs the boy jerking him erect and slamming him against the wall again
charleys legs dangling several feet above the floor
jerry leans in pressing his face close to charley
you deserve to die boy and he
begins to slowly choke charley suddenly stopping staring into the boys face
of course i could give you something ive never had
you forget abotrt me and ill forget about you
what do you say charley
judy can be heard rattling her bedroom door in its frame trying to get it open
jerrys head whips back and forth between the door to the hall and charley the sounds of judy struggling to get her bedroom door open becoming louder all the time
the door across the hall starts to give with a groan
with a hiss of frustrated fury the vampire whirls throws open charleys door and dashes out into the hail
charley throws off his shock at still being alive and plunges after him
charley skids to a halt in the hall sees the window at the far end is flung open wide and dashes to it sticking his head out and staring up
at the night sky
suddenly on the roof above him there is the sound of powerful wings beat ing away into the night
and then nothing
he slowly pulls his head back in and closes the window behind him locking it
he turns to find judy stumbling out to her room at last and looking at him
charley what happened
i i just had a nightmare
you know i had one last night
i was at this white sale and there i was standing at the counter and i reached for my credit cards only to realize i was naked as the day
i was born suddenly they both hear a dull thud as if metal is bending then nothing
judy stops turning back toward the closed window as charley peers through the glass seeing the sha dowy form of jerry dandrige slipping out of their garage and crossing into
back yard of his own house
now whats that
she takes a step for the window only to have charley grab her gently guiding her back toward her bedroom
just the raccoons in the garbage again
why dont you go back to sleep
but what about your nightmare
do you want a valium
im fine now honest
well i do needy sleep
i start the night shift tomorrow you know
yes nom i know
now good night
he pushes her through her door into her bedroom closing the door behind her and turning for his own room
charley closes the door behind him clicking on the tv for company hardly looking at it as he paces
the room lost in thought
its fright night again another hor ror film on
its the last thing he needs to see and hes about to lean over and turn
it off when the phone suddenly rings by his side raking him jump
be picks it up but doesnt say anything just listening at the receiver
suddenly he bears jerrys sibilant whisper
i know youre there charley i can see you
charley slowly turns staring out his window
there in the window of the house next door
stands jerry dandrige the phone to his ear staring at charley
jerry stands at his window staring back at the horror struck visage of the boy it the
window of the house next door while billy kneels at his side solicitously bandag ing his injured hand
i just destroyed your car charley
but its nothing compared to what im going to do to you tomorrow night
be hangs up slowly reaching out and drawing the shade
charley watches the shade blank the lit window out
he slowly hangs up the phone sinking onto the bed thinking hard and coming up with no answers
on the tv the horrorflick dissolves as peter vincent comes on doing a station break rap
hello horror fans
i hope youre enjoying i a vampire part two
its one of my best
did you know a lot of people dont believe in vampires
charley straightens up his gaze suddenly riveted to the screen
but i do
because i know they exist
i have faced them inn
all their guises men wolves bats
and i have always won
thats why they call me the great vampire killer
now watch me do it the horror flick comes back up on the screen a much younger peter stalking dracula through a drafty castle stake and mallet in hand
charley watches the movie with renewed if not fervent interest whispering to himself as he watches
get him peter
get him peter comes out of the studio dressed in his street clothes moping toward his car taking a cigarette from his cigarette case as he goes
eels in his fifties tall saturnine by nature very theatrical but at this particular moment in time also very depressed
charley jumps out from hiding and hurries toward him
vincent peter ignores him continuing to walk toward his car as
charley falls in beside him
could i talk to you a minute
nothing from peter please mr
vincent its terribly important
peter abruptly stopped resigned to the fact that boy is not going to let him alone
he whips out a fountain pen
all right what do you want me to sign
well you want my autograph dont you
i was curious about what you said last night on tv
you know about believing in vampires
what about it
were you serious
unfortunately none of your generation seems to be
what do you mean
venting his frustra tion on charley that i have been fired because no one wants to see vampire killers anymore
or vampires either
apparently all they want are demented madmen running around in ski masks hacking up young virgins
now ifyoull excuse me be starts for his car again charley falling in beside him
i believe in vampires
if only there had been more of you perhaps my rating would have been higher
in fact i have one living next door
would you help me kill him
that stops peter cold
he turns and stares at the boy
you know the murder of that girl that happened yesterday
well theguy who lives next door did it and hes a vampire
then peter turns away angrily
if this is your idea of a joke i am not amused
vincent im not joking
im deadly serious
peter stares at him sees he means it and decides charleys crazy
it makes him decidedly nervous
im sorry youll have to excuse me hurrying after him but mr
vincent im telling the peter stops before his car on outrageous old clunker and fishes out his keys
you just said you believe in i lied
now leave me alone
he opens the door only to have charley slam it shut star ing at peter desperately
a please you have to listen to me
the vampire tried to kill me last night and trashed mv car when he didnt succeed
hell be coming back for me tonight and if i dont get help hes going to kill me peter shoves him aside ahopping into his car quickly lock ing the
door behind him obviously terrified of charley
as he starts the engine charley beats on the window
vincent youve got to believe
peter backs up hauling ass out of the lot charley running after him
vincent he comes to a halt realizing its useless standing there watching as peter disappears out of the lot and down the street
amy rides up on her moped just as evil ed starts
up the front walk toward charleys house
she dismounts looking at him
what are you doing here
what about you
i thought you just dumped him
hurrying up the walk what im doing here is none of your business
hurrying after her aha you do like him
he disappears into the house right behind her
amy and evil ed push open the door and step inside amy yelling up the steps
no answer nothing but silence
she andevil ed exchange glances then start up the steps
amy and evil ed walk through the door and stop gasping at what they see
the room has been transformed from a normal happy kids room into a armament camp for a vampire assault
the window is nailed shut
strands of garlic a dozen at least hung from the curtains
dime store crosses and cru cifixes are everywhere in every imaginable shape and size
in the middle of the floor whittling a stake from a slat of grape fence a hammer by his side
whats all this for
not that i think ill need it
hell be dead before nightfall
worried glances with evil
ed who will be
im waiting for the guy he lives with to leave then im doing to go next door find his coffin and pound this through his heart
he holds up the stake
evil ed and amy look at it hor rified
thats murder charley
looking back at her with total seriousness you cant murder a vampire amy
theyre already dead remember
charley youre acting crazy
i dont have any choice amy
the police wont listen to me
my mother thinks im crazy you two even peter vincent thinks im nuts
you actually went to peter vincent
dandrige has got to be stopped
i just taped this
he hits the play button on his stereo dolby tape deck and a local radio newscast plays back
over the speakers
and now for the two oclock news
another body of a young woman was discovered early this morning in back of the sheraton mall he hits the stop button and turns back to them
after he attacked me last night he went out and had his dinner
turning to stare out the window at the dandrige house again no i dont have any choice
somebody has to stop him
on i need he rises and disappears out the door into the hall
evil ed turns to amy truly frightened for the first time
he whispers to her
what are we going to do
if we dont stop him hes actually going to try to kill this guy
with a stake through the heart
i know i know i dont believe this
its like fright night
her eyes lighting up thats it
we get peter vincent to prove to him that this dandrige guy isnt a vampire
shocked by the how are we going to do that
i dont know but we better figure out a way if we dont want to be visiting charley in jail
charley enters from the hall carrying another slat of wood to be sharpened
evil ed and amy fall silent as he takes his seat by the window and goes back to his whittling
nervously clearing her charley
its going to be dangerous doing into that house alone isnt it
youre going to need all the help you can get right
somebody like peter vincent for instance
i told you i already tried him
why not let us try before you do anything
why should he believe you anymore than he did me
maybe were better talkers
what happens if you go into that house alone and he gets you
whos going to stop him then
yeah then hell be able to suck his way through this entire town
not that it would be much of a loss
i dont know bl rev
pushing him hard charley itll be dark soon
you dont want to go into that house then do you
no youre right there
all right try him again
now you promise you wont do anything till
you hear from us
as charley nods she turns to evil ed come
on evil ed hurries out of the room amy following him
charley calls after her
she stops turning you dont believe me do you
i love you
she turns and hurries out of the room
billy stands at the window peering through the curtain at amy and evil ed as they hurry out of charleys house and start down the street
he glances at his watch
its four oclock another good two hours before dusk begins to fall
he turns and stares thoughtfully up the stairway in the di rection
of the attic
peter lets himself into his efficency apartment carrying a handful of mail
the place is small but neat the walls dotted with posters of his various movies all in the horror genre stretching back at least three decades
the bookshelves and table are dotted with memorabilia props and awards from his various roles
he stops by the
table going through the mail
theyre bills and more bills many marked last notice one of them an order to vacate this apartment within three days for failure to pay rent
suddenly there is a knock at his door and he goes wearily to answer it
he opens it to find amy and evil ed standing there
could we talk to you for a moment mr
his gaze sliding to the unpaid bills im afraid now isnt the best time please
its terribly important
he stares at her and
sees the desperation in her eyes
he steps back closing the door behind him and following them into the room
now what can i do for you
an autograph or an interview for your school newspaper
im afraid this is much more
i know youre a very busy man mr
vincent but were trying to save a boys life
well yes i see where that could be more important
would you care to explain yourself
you remember a fruitcake kid named charley brewster
he said he came to see you
shaking his head no
hes the one who thinks a vampire is living next door
looking at amy dear me i hope hes not a friend of yours
shes got the hots for the creep
she flushes and smacks evil ed making him yelp
she turns back to peter
we need your help to stop him mr
you see he really does believe his next door neighbor is a vampire
res planning to kill him
yeah with a stake through the heart
peter stares at them for a moment
are you two serious
as any nods my dear your friend needs a psychiatrist nota vampire killer
im afraid not my dear
nodding at an open suitcase on the bed you see hollywood beckons
ive been offered a starring role in a major movie
ive even had to quit fright night
so you see im ill hire you
ill give you money
quick as a wink how much
i have a five hundred dollar savings ill take it
sitting in a chair across from her sud denly all charm now how are we going to cure your little friend of this delusion
i got it all figured out
we all go next door to the neighbor and you run some kind of vampire test on him and pronounce him human
like in orgy of the damned
you know where you looked in the mirror and the guy didnt have a reflection and then you knew he was a vampire
ah yes that was one of my favorite roles
i still have the prop
he pulls out a silver cigarette case and flips it open
the inside of the lid is a mirror
he suddenly snaps it shut and slips it back into his pocket looking up at them
it sounds fine to me but how do we get this next door neighbor to agree
leave that to me nobody glances out the window as evil ed picks up the phone and dials but if they did theyd see night has fallen
as the camera watches all the clocks on the wall begin to tick signaling dusk has fallen and jerry is awakening
camera pans off the clocks to phone on the portico table
billy appears down the hall
from the kitchen
he picks it up
he listens as what must be the attic door is heard creaking open on the floor above
billy turns and stares up the stairway as jerry appears out of the darkness slowly walk ing down the steps
billy holds the phone out to him
its for you
jerry takes it
yes this is jerry dandrige
he listens some more slowly smiling i see
yes of course im always willing to help young people
but vm afraid crosses wouldnt do
you see ive been reborn recently
he smiles at billy billy smiles back
evil ed cups his hand over the receiver and turns to peter as amy watches
hes a reborn christian
he thinks crosses would be sacrilegious
ask him how he feels about holy water
into the phone how about holy water
he listens then back wont do either
tell him itll be just ordinary tap water and all he has to do is take a sip
evil ed turns back to the phone
jerry listens into the phone while billy watches
yes that sounds fine
only dont come over till six tomorrow
ill be out until then
he slowly hangs up and turns to billy
it seems we wont have to go out tonight after all
his friends are bringing him over tomorrow night
to prove to him that im not a vampire
so does jerry
evil ed and amy drive up in a cab hopping out and hurry up the walk toward charleys house
charley sits in the dark a razor sharp wooden stake in one hand a hammer in the other
hes dividing his attention between the window and the door
there is a m ck at the door
he raises the stake ready to defend himself
who is it
its me and amy stupid
charley opens the door and lets them in
amy throws her self into his arms almost dancing around the room in her joy
charley peter vincent said hed come
tomorrow at six
but dandrige will be out of his coffin by then
relax hes peter vincent the great vampire killer
he must know what hes doing right
i dont know
he didnt take it oh he did charley he did
looking at her honest
then maybe we it really have a chance to kill dandrige tomorrow night
tears welling up in his eyes you two dont know what its been like knowing theres a vampire living next door and having no one believe me its all right
charley she takes him in her arms holding him close as evil ed turns away in disgust staring out the window at the dark ened window next door
jerry sits in the dark rocking back and forth in a chair staring out the window into charleys room catching just the dim outlines of the three kids in the
house next door
he smiles if anybody saw the smile theyd run screaming in the opposite direction
the three teenagers charley evil ed and amy stand in front of the house waiting
dusk is slowly gathering the shadows lengthening as night closes about them
charley glances nervously at his watch
its six ten
he said hed be here at six right
he said hed be here hell be here
peters old clunker appears around the corner
amy is the first to see it
here he comes
the kids rush the car as peter pulls up
vincent i cant tell you how much i appreciate this peter slowly gets out of the car stretching to his full height
he wears his vampire killer regalia the victorian suit and carries a small leather satchel
there is some thing truly majestic about him
he looks down at charley laying it on
with a trowel
charley brewster i presume
as charley nods peter shakes his hand peter vincent vampire killer
and now down to business
where is the lair of this suspected creature of the night
pointing at the there
ah yes i see what you mean
there is a distinct possibility
he opens the satchel withdraws a small crystal vial of water slips it into his jacket pocket closes the bag and replaces it on the front seat of his car
he locks the car and turns back to the kids
straightening his shoulders
well shall we
wherere your stakes and hammer
i left them in my bag
youre not going in there without them
i have to prove hes a vampire before i kill him charley
but i know hes a vampire
but i am the one that has to know charley
this is holy water
if it touches him hell blister and in this case i asked him to drink it while we all watched
he readily agreed
which doesnt exactly strengthen your case does it
now shall we go
he takes a step up the walk
charley grabs his arm
vincent if im right and you prove hes a vampire hell kill us all right then and there
no he wont charley
not with me here to protect you
after all im peter vincent
he starts up the walk amy and evil ed following him
charley runs after him increasingly desperate
vincent you dont know how powerful he is
he can change into a bat and fly through the night peter stops on the porch knocking on the door listening to the boy with half an ear
of course charley of course
but then hes never dealt with me before either
billy cole opens the door his face lighting up when he sees peter
he shakes his hand warmly
vincent billy cole
this is a pleasure
wont you all come
he steps back and
peter evil ed and amy enter the house
charley has no choice but to follow
billy turns and yells up the stairs all the clocks behind him ticking madly the hour p
hey jerry theyre here
several seconds pass
peter turns to billy
perhaps he didnt hear you
oh he heard me all right
suddenly a step creaks at the top of the staircase where the shadows are the heaviest
slowly jerry dandrige walks down the stairs into view first his elegant shoes then his legs with their fashionable pants and finally the rest of him all beautifully turned out
his handsome face stares down
at them as he makes his entrance
there is something truly majestic about him both incredibly attrac tive and yet frightening at the same time
jerry reaches the bottom of the stairs and turns to peter with a blinding smile
shaking peters hand ive seen all your films and ive found them very amusing
why thank you turning to amy and evil ed and who might these two attractive people be
doing the intros this is ed thompson and amy peterson
bending low over amys hand and kissing it charmed
looking up at charley with a wicked smile isnt that what vampires are supposed to do charley
charley scowls at him
the others laugh
jerry turns to the living room
please come in be ushers peter into the living room billy following
amy and evil ed stare after jerry both totally captivated
god hes neat
she follows him into the living room
evil ed shoots charley a disgusted glance
some vampire brewster
he follows the others
left alone charley has no choice but to join them
jerry looks around at the packing crates and few pieces of dusty furniture and turns back to the others
youll have to excuse the mess
im still unpacking where do you keep your coffin
or do you have more than one
a warning growl its all right mr
im quite used to it by now
as you may or may not know charley even brought the police over a few days ago
peter amy and evil ed all look at charley shocked
charley you didnt
damn right i did only the cops didnt believe me anymore than any of you
back to jerry but youll believe me in a few seconds
vincent give him the holy water
charley theres no reason to be rude about this raising a placating hand its perfectly all right mr
where is the ah holy water
peter withdraws the vial from his pocket
jerry eyes it warily staring at peter his voice suddenly heavy with double meaning
are you sure thats holy water mr
playing it up positive
i saw father scanlon bless it down at saint marys myself
jerry takes the vial from his hand pulling the stopper and sniffing at it for the first time nervousness creeping into his manner
charley sidles up to amy whispering in her ear as jerry prepares to drink the water
get ready to run
ill protect you with this
he edges a cross out of his pocket just giving her a glimpse of it
he glances up just as jerry lifts his head back and
downs the contents of the vial in one swallow
he turns to peter triumphantly
charley you saw it
are you convinced now that mr
dandrige isnt a vampire
charley stares at jerry and the vial stunned almost into speechlessness
but it cant be you just saw it charley
you know as well as i do that no vampire could drink blessed water
then it wasnt blessed
are you calling me a liar young man
charley looks at jerry
jerry stares back at hire smiling
charley suddenly whips the cross out of his packet and holds it up
if hes not a vampire then have him touch this
jerry stiffens his face losing its color but none of the others notice
theyre all looking askance at charley
peter steps up to the boy
charley youve already made a fool of yourself once
theres no reason to compound the error
yes charley youve already
caused your friends quite enough pain
his eyes burning into charley hammering the you dont want to cause them any more do you
spring billy sliding into place blocking the doorway to the portico
the tension level in the room is suddenly unbearable
peter amy and evil ed are aware of it although they dont know the reason
charley slowly edges the cross back into his pocket
no no of course not
and youre finally convinced im not a vampire either correct
their eyes lock a moment passes
then finally yes
jerry smiles at him and the tension suddenly flows out of the room
billy even smiles
jerry steps forward usher ing them all toward the portico
well im glad thats all
they all stop before the front door billy in the back ground jerry turns to peter
i cant tell you how much i
appreciate this mr
youve been a great help
not at all mr
glad to be of service
jerry ignores charley turning to amy and evil ed as peter steps back reaching into his coat pocket for his cigarette case
its been very nice meeting both of you
please feel free to drop by anytime
his eyes singling out amy and
burning into her youll always be welcome
her eyes beginning to glaze over id id like that mr
please call me jerry
her face is beginning to stiffen her eyes turning blank
charley looks at her in sudden alarm remembering the girl he saw through the window that night
he grabs amy by the arm tugging
her toward the door
cmon lets get out of here pulling away from him her gaze never just a minute charley smiling jerry turns to evil ed as behind them all peter opens his
cigarette case takes out a smoke about to tamp it down on a thumbnail when he glances at the mirror on the inside of the lid
he sees amy evil ed and charley grouped around where jerry dandrige should be standing but hes not there
its as though the kids are talking to thin air
the same goes for you
ed i suspect we have many of the same interests
you know in such things as horror movies and the occult
peters head jerks up and he looks at the doorway
now he sees jerry standing there talking to the kids
peter looks back down at the mirror again
his face goes chalk white his mouth gasps for air and he drops the case from his palsied hands
it smashes to the hardwood floor with a crash
everyone turns and looks at him
something wrong mr
peter hurriedly scoops up the case trying to hide his shaking hands and keep the tremor out of his voice
no no just my clumsiness
come along we must be going
thank you again mr
dandrige he ushers the teenagers out the front door as jerry watches puzzled by his sudden change in attitude
peter plunges down the walk to his ca r the kids hurrying to keep up with him
charley looks at him
whats wrong with you
he stops by his car fumbling his keys out of his pocket hardly able to fit them into the lock with his trembling hands
then why are your hands shaking
his hands shaking worse than ever theyre not shaking
be finally gets the door open hurriedly sliding in behind the wheel slamming the door behind them
charley leans down speaking through the partially open window
you saw something in there didnt you something that convinced you he was a vampire
will you be quiet
is jerry dandrige a vampire or not
struggling to get the car started no of course not
vincent you have to tell me
our lives depend on it
he didnt cast a reflection in my mirror
vincent you have to call the polic e and tell them the engine finally catches and he roars away in a cloud of burning rubber charley watching him go half
frustrated to death
jerry peer out the window watching the kids walk away from the house
almost to himself i could teach her so much what
jerry turns away from the window sits at the foot of the stairs
still at window well at least theyll never believe the kid now
jerry glances down and sees a sliver of mirror from peters cracked cigarette case at his feet
he picks it up examining it
he casts no reflection in it
he holds it up for billy to see
he grabs his leather jacket and moves down the hallway toward the back door billy quickly following
the kids are walking down the street away from the dandrige house the camera craning up to follow them as they recede in the distance the darkness slowly swallowing them
turning to amy and evil ed well at least you two heard him
he said dandrige had no reflection
probably just a trick of the light
whirling on amy you felt how evil dandrige was didnt you amy
remember the way he looked at you
confused by the yes sort of bored with it all oh for christ sake he turns about to duck between two houses
where are you going
its dinner time
wait a minute
we walk amy home first
because its after dark pencil
dick and theres a vampire back there
be points back at the dandrige house
evil ed just stares at him
oh shit brewster youre certifiable you know that
they all start down the street together again growing smaller and smaller until they disappear into the darkness
the town of rancho corvallis is middling size perhaps a hundred thousand people
there are several tall buildings around not many but enough
street lamps cast pools of bright light and deep shadows everywhere
there are a few pedestrians out a few cars passing by but once again not many
the three kids walk down the street
evil ed stops before the open mouth to a shadow encrusted alleyway
lets cut through here
we want people and lights the more the better
look brewster vampires dont exist
havent you gotten that through your thick head yet
what if youre wrong evil
what if dandrige is a vampire and he thinks you know it
would you walk down that alley then
the hair on the back of evil eds neck starts to stand on end
then he denies it
aw fuck you brewster
he takes a step toward the alley
charley grabs him
ed please just stick with us
you may be chickenshit but im not
he disappears down the alley into the darkness
amy and charley stare after him
she turns to charley
what do we do
let him go
no vampires gonna want hint anyway
probably give him blood poisoning
theyre about to turn away when a blood curdling scream echoes out of the darkness of the alleyway
its evil ed
charley and amy dash headlong into the alley after him
they speed through the darkness skidding to a halt on the shadow slick pavement looking around
where is he
amy spots him laying crumpled against a wall
they dash to him kneeling by his side
evil eds eyes are closed his breathing shallow
charley tries to shake him awake
ed ed are you all right
nothing from evil ed
charley looks at amy
jesus i warned him evil eds eyes suddenly snap open staring up wildly at charley
he got me charley
he bit me
grabbing him by you know what youre gonna have to do dont you
as charley shakes his head really scared kill me charley
kill me before i turn into a vampire and he suddenly heaves himself
at charley his mouth opening going for his throat as charley jerks back terrified
give you a hickey
he suddenly lets charley go rolling on the pavement and laughing like a maniac perfectly all tight
charley springs to his feet furious with him
you asshole you fucking asshole
evil ed rolls on the ground in hysterics pointing at him and laughing loudly
ha hah really fooled you
climbing to his feet and dusting you really believed me you poor dope
flushed with anger youll get yours someday evil
he grabs amys hand and walks back down the alley toward the street and the lights
evil ed yells after him
when im bit by a vampire
there are no such things as vampires you fruit cake
still chuckling to himself he turns in the opposite direc tion and disappears down the alleyway into the darkness
a moment passes nothing but silence
then jerry dandrige steps out from a shadowy wall where it would be impossible for any mortal to have concealed himself
its almost as though he materializes out of the night
he stares after charley and amy and then slowly turns to stare in the opposite direction after evil ed
he slowly walks in that direction
evil ed walks along feeling safe and secure
and then he hears it footsteps behind him coming through the dark slowly toward him
he turns and looks back
charley amy that you
he hears nothing but those footsteps getting closer
the fear starts to work at him twisting up his gut and making his forehead sheen with sweat
he steps forward yelling out with false bravery
you it isnt working
im not scared
and then jerry emerges out of the shadows smiling at him
with a scream evil ed turns and runs
evil ed runs like hes never run before apounding through the dark smashing into traffic cans and falling to the ground leaping to his feet ignoring his skinned hands and
bruised knees running for his life and knowing it
he suddenly skids to a halt facing a brick wall
he whirls his breath coming in ragged gasps now peering down the alleyway into the dark listening to those footsteps getting closer and closer
he slowly backs away until he has no further to go his back against the brick wall on the verge of hysteria
no no the footsteps suddenly stop
nothing but silence
the seconds tick past
he takes a step away from the wall peering into the darkness with something like hope preying that maybe just maybe dandrige has given up
a voice suddenly whispers in his ear no more than an inch away
evil ed turns with a scream to find jerry standing right next to him
almost insane with fear now slobbering like a wounded animal he backs away from the shadowy figure hitting the corner and sliding to the cold pavement almost curled up in
a fetal ball tears streaming from his eyes
dandrige walks over to him staring down with something like pity in his eyes
you have nothing to fear from me
in a voice like honey i understand what its like being different
only they wont make fun of you anymore or beat you up
ill see to that
all you have to do is take my hand
evil ed slowly looks up at him through his tear stained eyes to see jerry staring down at him his
hand outstretch ed to
him a slight smile on his face gentle seductive beguiling
here edward take my hand
evil ed looks down at the hand outstretched to him
its beautiful perfectly shaped with thin elegant fingers almost womanly the nails impossibly long perfectly shapped tapering to five gleaming razor sharp points
evil ed slowly reaches out and takes the vampires hand
jerry smiles down at him and slowly leans down lifting him up into the last embrace edward thompson will ever know
charley and amy walk rapidly along a street heading toward amys home
he casts a glance at her
how much further
about ten minutes a death rattle long and high pitched suddenly comes to them echoing through the city streets down alleyways and across apartment buildings faint yet filled with so
much terror it stops them in their tracks and leaves them staring fearfully about at the shadows
what was that
evil ed messing around
not funny evil
her voice bounces off the walls down the street and then dies leaving them staring at the darkness and the shadows fearful
amy tries to act brave turning to charley
they start down the street again charley glancing nervously over his
shoulder in the direction of evil eds scream
amy what if evil really was in trouble
oh come on charley dont let him suck you in again all the street lights suddenly go out plunging them into almost total blackness
they whirl looking back down the now totally dark street slowly backing away from the darkness
to army in a dont tell me its a power outage
what else could it be charley stops grabbing her and nods to a light pole oppo site them
she follows his gaze to see a power box on the pole its front ripped open the wires inside shredded
before they can even gasp at the sight they hear the sound of huge wings beating overhead
a huge shadow of a bat flies across the building wall opposite them
thats all it takes they whirl dashing down the street
they come racing down a street under a bridge and start up the incline toward the roar above
they turn onto the bridge starting to
slowing to a walk breathing hard
i think we lost him
stopping and turning charley you were right about the holy water
we faked it
im just sorry i didnt believe you
its all right amy
he kisses her takes her hand and they start walking up the bridge
weve got it made and they freeze
there high above them on one of the arches of the bridge so high up no one could possibly get there unless they flew stands jerry dandrige staring down at
with a scream they whirl racing off the bridge and down the street
they suddenly turn the corner only to find they are facing jerry dandrige standing on the sidewalk directly in front of them amused by the frozen expressions of horror on
he grabs amys hand the two of them whirling and dis appearing around the street corner
they race down the street
for the far corner
they whip around the corner only to skid to a halt
jerry dandrige again smiling at them
he takes a step toward them and they whirl diving down a side street
they tear down the street teeing the club radio a fashionable disco across the street
its entrance is jammed with people trying to get in all of them dressed to the teeth in new wave and neo punk
charley dives for it dragging amy after him just as jerry appears
around the corner behind them walking toward then with a steady gait relaxed in no great hurry a hunter sure of his kill
charley and amy fight their way through the crowd until they reach the front door
a bouncer stands there check ing i
s and collecting the cover charge
he hardly looks down as amy and charley step up
five bucks apiece
charley frantically searches his pockets and comes up with change and nothing else
amy pulls out a ten dollar bill and hands it to him
ive got it as charley takes it from her he glances over her shoulder and sees jerry moving through the crowd toward them
he shoves the money at the bouncer hurriedly
the man takes it and charley grabs amy pulling her toward the door watching over his shoulder as jerry keeps coming closer and closer toward them
suddenly the bouncer reaches out and collars charley
hey just a sec
how old are you two
lying through his eighteen
let me see some i
charley glances back
jerry is just an arms length away now
a man suddenly shoulders him aside just as hes about to grab charley and amy
hey wait you turn
jerry turns and stares at the man
whatever the man sees in jerrys eyes gives him the cold sweats and
he backs hurriedly away
charley grabs amy using the moment to pull her away from the door and jerry
the bouncer shouts after them holding up the ten spot
hey what about your
charley and amy come out of the crowd backing away from the door just as jerry emerges stepping after them
hes only ten feet away now smiling as he approaches both kids realizing its hopeless to run at this point
backing away charley and amy cross the mouth of an alley
theres the crash of a garbage pail and charley glances down the alley to see a dish washer from the club dumping garbage the bright lights of the door into
the kitchen shining like a beacon in the night
charley grabs amys hand and jerks her down the alley after him as he races for the door
he and amy race through the mad house of a kitchen one of the cooks glancing up from chopping lettuce as they speed pass
waving his butcher knife at them hey you cant go in there
they burst through the door to find themselves in a packed video disco four huge screens overlooking the dance floor all of them playing michael jacksons thriller
charley and amy disappear into the crush of people
a moment later the cook appears from the kitchen signaling a bouncer cir cling the floor keeping a wary eye out for trouble
charley and amy fight their way through the sea of dancers charley looking about
he sees what he wants a sign above a hallway reading
rest rooms and phone
he drags amy in that direction
at the corner of the dance floor the cook can be seen ges turing to the bouncer pointing in the direction the two kids took
they break through the crowd and down the short hallway to a bank of pay phones opposite the restrooms
charley digs a dime outaof his pocket drops it and dials
amy screams at him to make herself heard above the din
who are you calling
back into the phone yeah give me lieutenant lennox
there is a knock at peters locked and barred door
he slowly rises from his chair the cross clenched in his hand staring at it terrified
the knocking comes
again louder this time
he presses his lips to the door whis pering

peter slips the cross into his pocket and unlocks the door
be pulls evil ed into the room hurriedly locking and bar ring the door behind him
evil ed has changed and not for the better
his skin is more sallow huge dark circles under his eyes his lips bloodless his collar pulled up tightly around his neck
peter turns to him
what are we going to do
what are you going to do not me
peter stares at him as evil ed slowly reaches up and pulls down the collar of his shirt revealing two small puncture marks on his throat
peters eyes widen in horror evil eds smile only grows wider
i used to admire you you know that
of course that was before i found out what aa fake you were
he advances on peter looming over him peter staring up at the boy in growing terror
ed smiles at him reveal ing two huge fangs
peter leaps out of the chair dashing for the door fumbling to undo the locks and bars with trembling fingers
evil ed watches his rictus grin just growing wider
peter vincent the great vampire killer indeed
he throws himself at peter grabbing him from behind and whirling him about opening his mouth wide to sink his fangs into him
peter straightens grabbing the cross from his pocket and thrusting it directly into evil eds face slamming it into his forehead between his eyes
his skin sizzles and cracks smoke rising and evil ed backs away bent over screaming in pain his hands held to his face
he slowly looks up as peter watches frozen in horror
evil ed drops his hands from his face revealing a smoking sign of the cross branded into his forehead
he stares at peter
what have you done to me
he turns to look into the wall mirror but theres no re flection
for him to see
he whirls on peter screaming at him like the spoiled brat he is
what have you done to me
he takes a step toward peter and peter thrusts the cross at him
the master will kill you for athis
and not fast slowly oh so slowly peter advances on him the cross held out in front of him with shaking hands backing evil ed across the room toward the
back i say back pk rev
evil ed snarls at him
like some trapped feral animal and suddenly whirls throwing himself headlong out the window in an explosion of shattering glass
peter rushes to the window staring out at the street below
he cranes his neck peering at the heavens above
he draws his head back in leaning against
the wall gasping for breath on hand on his heart feeling it about to leap out of his chest with the horror of it all
charley slams the phone back into its cradle in frustra i tion amy looking at him worriedly
he doesnt believe me
sinking back against the wall in defeat im scared charley
im real scared
i wont let him get you amy
we havent got a chance charley
not the two of us against him
what about your mother
she cant handle this amy

oh charley he doesnt care about us i paid him to be there today
we dont have any choice amy
now give me his number
she reluctantly digs a scrap of paper out of her pocket as charley drops another dime
a growl of inhuman what
his hand snaps out grabbing evil ed and jerking hin for ward into the spill of light from the overhead street lamp
the sign of the cross is clearly seen on his forehead
jerry stares at it in revulsion
what is that
he had a cross fool
he slams him back into the seat with so much force the crossbar that holds it inplace
jerry leaps out of the jeep slamming the door behind him evil ed and jerry staring after him as he strides toward the entrance to the club
charley stands at the phone amy beside him watching anxiously as he listens to the phone ring on the other end
cmon mr vincent answer please answer
unseen by either of them jerry dandrige sweeps through the front door of the club moving like a god among mere mor tals his eyes now glowing a faint red
sweeping the crowd of dancers as he moves toward the dance floor
peter sits in the dark clutching a cross trying not to shake as he watches the ringing phone too terrified to an swer
it keeps on ringing
charley turns his back to the dance floor and amy shield ing the phone with his body to cut down on some of the din swearing to himself as he
answer me damnit answer me behind him amy stiffens staring out onto the dance floor at the sea of people
moving through the dancers like a golden god moving amid mere mortals walks jerry dandrige
the hot colored lights of the dance floor highlight his hair accentuating his gracefulness making him seem even more beautiful than he is
he stops just at the edge of the floor and holds his hand out to amy the orgiastic dancing swirling on behind him the pounding sensual beat of the funk
rock washing over them both
his eyes burn into hers willing her to come to him
terrified she turns back toward charley
in that moment jerry disappears from the mouth of the hallway amy turn ing back just as shes about to grab charley only to see hes gone
she stops more intrigued than frightened the image of that beautiful man holding out his hand to her sharp in her mind
she takes a step forward down the hall continuing down the hall until she has a clear view of the dancers
jerrys nowhere to be seen
charley is just about to turn and glance
in her direction when a voice answers on the other end of the line
charley cups one hand over his ear bending dawn to hear better
behind hint amy slowly disappears down the hall way and onto the dance floor
vincent this is charley brewster
you gotta help us
jerry dandrige has me and amy trapped in this club peter moves to the window the phone in his hand
he slowly pulls back the curtain peering down at the street below
im sorry charley
i cant do that
but you have to come mr
youre the only one who knows whats going on
you have to understand charley
eds one of them now
he just tried to kill me

charley is screaming into the phone almost in tears
if you don t dandrigell kill us

im sorry charley i just cant
he hangs up the phone flattening himself back against the wall terrified
charley slams the phone down turning to amy
god damn him
he wont help us only amy is gone the hallway empty
charley rushes toward the dance floor
charley emerges from the hall looking about in the crush of people for amy
nothing its as if shes disappeared into thin air
he plunges out into the crowd
in another part of the bar area charley moves among the people desperately searching for amy
he passes the drunken teenagers ignoring them as he suddenly bumps into a table a man yelling up at hixi angrily
hey watch out
charley glances down to see the table of users grouped around their mirror of white powder
he moves quickly away searching for amy
he stops by the wall of poseurs cruising everything that walks by asking a girl that looks from behind as though she must be amys age
pardon me have you seen a girl pk rev
the girl turns to him
revealing herself as a woman well into her mid forties decked out like a teenager sylvia miles ten years ago staring at him hungrily
forget her take me instead she reaches out to kiss charley and he flees the crowd of flesh
watchers laughing at him as he goes
he moves along a wall of lesbians stopping one his des peration growing
im looking for a girl so am i
before charley can recover a woman moves into her arms charley shocked and disconcerted backing away until he bumps to a halt against a heavy metal biker the kind of
guy whos into twisted sister
the parody of biker throws him to the floor for the insult his friends walking par odies of bikers laughing at charley as he leaps to his feet and backs
away into the crowd
he breaks free of the packed humanity stopping on the stairs
it is at that moment that he catches a glimpse of amy on the dance floor dancing with jerry
he hurries down the stairs and onto the floor
on the dance floor amy moves
with jerry their bodies locked together slowly falling
into his eyes dancing slower and slower with him until finally she has no will left of her own
she is in love with him
it is at that moment that she bends her head forward laying it on his shoulder exposing her neck to him her eyes staring at the wall as they revolve
around and around jerry bending down to kiss her neck his mouth slowly opening
it is at that moment amy sees her reflection in the mirrors mounted against one wall
she is dancing alone
shocked back to her senses she goes rigid in jerrys arms trying to pull away from him screaming as the music and the dancers stop
across the dance floor charley hears her scream and pushes his way through the sea of humanity fighting his way to her side where she stands with jerry once again
caught in his eyes slowly losing her will
charley grabs jerry by the shoulder trying to pull him away from amy
let her go
jerry looks down at him smiling mocking him as amy sways in his arms her eyes locked on
whats wrong charley
he grinds his pelvis against
amy dry humping her in front of charley
she throws her head back her mouth opening in something close to ecstasy her eyes glazed staring up at him with adoration giving herself to him as she cocks her
head to one side exposing her tender young throat
charley goes crazy
you filthy son of a bitch
he swings at him only to have jerry release amy catching charleys fist in the palm of his hand easily
be stares down at the boy smiling cruelly
you shouldnt lose your temper charley
it isnt polite
he tightens his grip slowly squeezing charleys fist
you can almost hear the knuckle bones grinding as charleys facecontorts in agony driving him to his knees before jerry
charley looks up at him tears of pain streaming down his face
gasping with pain you cant kill me here i dont want to kill you charley
i want you to bring peter vincent to my house just the two of you
that is if you ever want to see amy again
he casually releases charley letting the boy drop to the floor as he disappears with amy into the swirling mass of dancers
charley leaps to his feet ignoring the pain in his hand and plunges after them
charley breaks free of the swirl near the bar looking everywhere and not seeing either of them
suddenly hes grabbed by a strong pair of arms
he looks up to find himself staring into the face of a huge black bouncer
let me go the man ignores him calling back over his shoulder
hey donny this the one
another huge bouncer the one the cook talked to when charley and amy sneaked into the club steps out of the whirl staring down at the boy
yeah its him
wheres your girlfriend
charley suddenly sees jerry and amy breaking through the throng heading for the entrance
he points to them wildly
thats her over there with that older c mon
he cuts across the floor on a diagonal to intercept jerry and amy the black bouncer dragging charley after him in a steel grip
jerry finally reaches the throng near the front door starting to move through it with amy when sud denly the two bouncers and charley block his way
donny jerks amy out of jerrys hand passing her to the black bouncer nodding at her and charley
get the two of them out of here
jerry steps toward amy his face beginning to darken with rage the music pulsating around them people swirling by on all sides
shes mine donny puts out his hand stopping jerry as the black bouncer drags charley and amy toward the front door
you want chicken man you
go to some other club
jerry snarls his eyes beginning to glow his hair slicking back slightly the hint of fangs beginning to protrude over his upper lip as rage overtakes him
he raises his right hand holding it out in
the bouncers face so the man can clearly see what is happening
the nails on the four fingers pop out literally elongating several inches in front of the mans eyes growing into razor sharp claws that sparkle in the overhead lights
the bouncer terrified screams for hiscompanion
hey leon get back here
toward the entrance to the club leon releases charley and amy hustling back toward his buddy
charley grabs amy pulling her toward the door
cmon quick but its
too late already
donny screams as the talons whistle through the air tearing his throat out in one swipe scattering blood everywhere blinding several of the dancers swirling
by hitting people drinking at the bar a couple necking in a corner blood flying everywhere
jerry steps around the corpse as it topples backward over a table of coke users the bouncers dead eyes staring up at them
leon dashes up lunging for jerry
the vampires hand snaps out grabbing him by the throat squeezing driving those claws deep into the mans neck holding him like a chicken enjoying a second of his death
throes and then casually flinging him into the center of the floor bringing the music and all the dancing to a shrieking halt as this new group of people stare at another dead body
pandemonium erupts throughout the club people screaming and rushing for the exit the fear contagious all of them streaming toward the bottleneck of a hallway leading to the front door
turning it into a battleground of panicked terrified people clawing and screaming to get out of the club
close to the front door charley and amy fight their way through the madness trying to gain the outside and freedom as behind them a wave of panicked humanity sweeps
hold on to me suddenly jerry steps out in front of them and sweeps amy away from
him the crowd flowing around charley and carry ing him off in the opposite direction as he fights and screams to get back to her
but the sea of humanity is too much for him it pushes him first away from and then toward the front door leaving him no choice but to go with
it or be trampled
charley bursts through the entrance of the club just in time to see the black jeep roaring away down the street evil ed peering out the back window grinning wi
ldly at him mocking him with his full set of fangs
peter is hurriedly packing shoving the bare necessities into his suitcase preparing to abandon his mementos of a lifetime in his rush to get out of town while hes still
theres a knock at the door
be looks up terrified
who is it
let me in
the door cracks open an inch a chain across the latch
peter peers out at him
are you one of them too
what are you talking about
peter thrusts his cross out through the crack
here grab this
charley does as told
peter peers at his hand
he hurriedly slips the chain from the door and pulls the boy inside
peter relatches the door and hurries back to his packing
charley watches him
what are you doing
peter closes the suitcase hurrying for the door
charley steps in front of him blocking his path
dandrige has amy
he says hell kill her unless we come to his house
peter stops staring at charley stunned
the blood drains from his face
oh my god
for the phone the police ill call the police grabbing the phone away from him no they wont believe you
peter collapses in a chair staring blindly ahead
peter its just us
were going to have to save amy
i was paid to be there today
and you still want me to help you
youre peter vincent the great vampire killer
looking up at him thats a character in a movie charley
thats not even my real name
repressing a sob and im terrified im sorry but i am
i cant do it alone peter
if you dont help amys going to die
and me too probably
r nothing f om peter please peter
im sorry charley
quietly of ter a yeah me too
he walks to the door slipping quietly out of the apart ment leaving peter staring miserable at the floor
amy slowly regains consciousness opening her eyes to find herself laying on the floor jerry dandrige looming over her
she cowers back looking about the bedroom
where am i
where you wanted to be
he reaches out a hand to her she cowers back
you dont really care
he hits play on the tape deck
funk rock hot and driving snakes out of the speakers
he turns back to her holding out his hand
she looks away then glances up only to find herself trapped in his gaze
to weave his way across the floor toward her
every move a suggestion an invitation all of it somehow hypnotic
she stares at him fighting to break free
finally she manages to turn her head away staring at the floor screaming at him
liarl i love him
it doesnt faze him he just keeps moving to the beat slowly oh so slowly coming closer and closer to where she sits on the floor his voice stroking her
as he comes
am i lying amy
he stops above her leaning down his voice a husky post coital whisper
and shes gone his eyes drawing her in and swallowing her up drowning her in their faint red glow
he holds out his hand to her
she slowly takes it and he raises her up into his arms moving in place to the music with her smiling down as she stares up at him blindly
he gently pushes her head down on his shoulder exposing her tender young neck
and then he slowly bends down his mouth opening to expose those two razor sharp fangs with their alabaster cast slowly delicately sliding them beneath her skin
her body arches both arms pressing him to her her body clinging to his
and then she screams bucking under him like shes having something like a sexual climax only better much better
and just underneath her scream
is this horrid greedy sucking noise jerry dandrige feeding
charley walks through the darkness with cross and stake held in his hands slowly approaching the dandrige house through a side yard across the street
the shadows loom up over him the wind causing the tree branches to rustle charley growing more and more nervous with every passing second
charley steps out of the darkness of the trees across the street from the dandrige house stopping to stare at it
the huge silent dark
house no longer looks like every other house on the block
it seems to have assumed a life of its own and turned into a hulking brooding monster about to leap forward and pounce on him
charley grips his stake and hammer checks the cross stuck in his jacket pocket takesa deep breath squares his shoulders and starts the slow walk toward the dandrige house
through the trees he moves into the shadows and darkness across the street closer and closer to that hulking evil house
suddenly ahand snaps out of the darkness grabbing him by the shoulder
peter vincent ready to do battle with the undead
charley whirls to find himself staring into peter vincents drawn face
he wears his victorian suit his whole demeanor that of his public persona the vampire killer
peter this is serious pulling himself up to his full height i am serious
ee drops to his knees pulling an assortment of his movie props out of his leather bag
lets see stakes hammer crosses what about billy cole
whats going to stop him
peter rises holding up a pistol
from orgy of the damned
what if hes not human
bullets arent going to stop him then
he walks around during the day doesnt he
then hes human
turning toward the lets go
the two of them cross the street heading toward the house which now seems to be staring at them about to charge them
charley glances at peter
cutting him off not now
but peter isnt really paying attention to charley
his eyes are on that malevolent looking house the house looming larger and larger above him as they get closer and closer
peter begins to slow his nerve draining away as the true evilness of the
place begins to eat at him
he finally comes to a halt staring at the house
charley stops looking
nothing nothing at all
he joins charley the two of them slowly walking toward the house again peter becoming more and more nervous the closer they get
charley takes a step for the front door
peter grabs him
are you crazy
not through the front door
lets go around to the back and sneak in the front door slowly swings open on creaking hinges seemingly of its own accord
peter and charley turn to look at it a dark gaping hole like an open mouth ready to swallow them
be starts moving up the porch toward the door
peter moves with him his gaze fixed on that gaping mouth of an open doorway mumbling to himself as he goes
im peter vincent the great vampire killer
im they disappear into the house jerry dandrige suddenly stepping into frame staring after them
charley and peter stop and stare around in the darkness
nothing moves not even a shadow
charley nods up the stairs
they start up the stairway
outside the house the subjective camera watches them craning past the front
windows onto the side of the house
watching charley and peter through the windows as they mount the stairs the camera slowly heading up the side of the house
jerry appears outside his bedroom window floating there
t he leans forward opening the window about to climb in
ll i i
p eter suddenly grabs charley freezing as he hears that second story bedroom window opening
did you just hear something
pausing and listening no
they start up the stairway
peter grabs charley again digging his fingers into the boys arms listening hard
lets wait until dawn
hell be in his coffin then
well have a better chance of getting amy
amyll be dead by then too
now he turns to start up the stairs only to have a voice come out of the darkness on the landing above
he steps forward into the light looking welcome to fright night
peter almost turns tail and runs right there
charley grabs him holding him in place on the staircase staring up at the vampire looming above them
all you have to do is get he starts
down the steps
peter whips out one of the crosses thrusting it at the vampire
in his vampire killer back spawn of satan
he reaches out takes the cross
from peters hand and crumples it contemptuously tossing
be turns back to peter
you have to have faith in order for it to work on me mr
he starts down the stairs again peter backing away terrified his nerve completely gone now
charley steps forward staring up at dandrige defiantly
he whips out his cross thrusting it at the vampire
jerry stops staring at the cross
charley starts up the stairs toward him the cross held in front of him
jerry backs up the stairs away from the cross disappearing into the darkness at the top of the landing
charley glances back at peter triumphantly
were gonna make
it billy cole suddenly steps out of the darkness in front of him rips the cross from the boys hand and viciously backhands him across the face
with a scream charley smashes through the
stairway railing plunging to the hallway floor below
he lands with a solid thud lying there groaning
jerry steps in front of billy staring down at peter on the stairway smiling at him
then he slowly starts down the stairs toward peter
with a scream the actor whirls racing down the steps and out the front door
peter smashes through the front door yelling up the stairway
he grabs the phone from the table and punches out a number speaking hurriedly into it
hello operator get me the police
no response not even a dial tone
he holds the phone up only to see the cord has been ripped from the wall
his eyes widen in horror his gaze snapping back up the stairs
brewster he plunges up the stairs
he bursts through the door to see judy in bed the back of her head to him her blond hair lying across the pillow
he hurries across the room
toward her relief sweeping his features
brewster thank god
all the phones have been ripped from the be reaches out turning her over on the bed to face him
only it isnt judy its evil ed wearing one of her wigs
i did it
he grins up at peter as he
slowly rises the wig slipping from his head his features already transformed subtly into those of a vampire the hair slicked back on his head his face elongated two huge
white fangs slashing over his lower lip
peter staggers back staring at him in horror
wheres charleys mother
shes working nights apparently
she left a note for charley
holding out the crumpled note as he takes a step his dinners in the oven
with a scream peter whirls and plunges out of the room
peter races down the hallway only to bit a table in the dark crashing to the floor on the landing the
table splintering beneath him
he sits up groaning holding his leg
he suddenly hears a growling low and deep and vicious coming from the other end of the hallway
he looks up staring into the darkness
suddenly a huge wolf as ugly as evil ed tears out of the master bedroom skidding to a halt staring back at peter
its eyes glow like red hot coals in the dark saliva drip ping from its huge fangs
peter scrambles to his feet about to plunge down the stairs when with a terrible snarl the huge animal bounds down the hall toward him
with a scream peter picks up a splintered leg of the table just as the wolf launches itself into the air toward his jugular vein
he slams the jagged piece of wood into the animals chest as it flies past its snapping jaws missing his throat by an inch the wolf hits the landing railing
and plows through it almost in slow motion plunging over the side
the wolf tumbles through the air in a blur of fur and fangs down and down until suddenly evil ed smashes into the hardwood floor below with a terrible thud
he lays there the long wooden splinter buried in his heart
peter hurries down the stairs stopping above him and staring down watching in fascinated horror as humanity leaks back into his eyes his face transforming into that of a normal
teenage boy as he dies
he looks up at peter with suddenly soft brown eyes
he dies peter staring down at him sorrow struck by the waste and horridness of it all
jerry comes through thei door with charley over his shoulder and dumps him on the floor a few feet from where amy lies curled up in a fetal ball
he nods at
amy as charley slowly opens his eyes regaining his senses
you wanted her there she is
charley glances to his side sees amy lying there and crawls to her
he gently turns her towardhim
his words die on his lips
amys eyes are clenched shut her face drenched with sweat her entire body trembling
watches his horrified reaction smiling
you see you gave me so much trouble i thought you deserved a special punishment
staring up at him what have you done to her
i just bit her a little bit thats all
jerry just stares at him silently leaving no room for the boy to disbelieve him
charley suddenly leaps for him furious with rage
jerry casually knocks him aside flinging him through the air against the far wall with his incredible strength
charley crumples to the floor stunned
jerry walks over to him and drops a wooden stake at his feet
charley stares at youre going to need it just before dawn
with a bow he lets himself out of the room closing the door behind him
the key can be heard turning in the lack
charley stares around for a moment gathering his senses
he sees the window has been boarded up with plank after plank and nail after nail
it would be impossible for him to rip it apart just as it would be impossible for anyone to hear him through
it were he to scream
he crawls to amy gently turning her over only to see that she has already begun to change her upper lip slipping back as he stares at her revealing lengthening
bicuspids the beginnings of fangs
her eyes are black like bottom less pits
he raises his head and screams his voice filled with anguish and despair
dandrige pauses halfway down the stairs listening to the agony in charleys voice as the scream dies away
he smiles then continues to walk down the stairs
peter faces the brooding terrible house his stake and hammer in either hand his face set hard with deter mination
throwing his shoulders back he begins to walk slowly toward the front door
he slips through the front door pausing to look down the hall
the basement door is open the sounds of jerry and billy working down there faintly heard
he hurries up the stairs
he works his way from door to door till he finds the locked one
he r aps on it lightly whispering through a crack in the frame
charley hears the whisper and springs to his feet hurrying to the door
in a whisper peter
im going to have to break the door down
make as much noise as you can
charley turns to the wall beating on it and yelling for all hes worth
help let me out
jerry and billy are preparing a spare coffin for amy dumping dirt into it from the bottom of the huge ornate coffin charley saw them carrying into the house on
that first night so long ago
they pause in their work as they hear charleys scream dying away
jerry smiles at billy
i think she just opened her eyes
peter hits the door from the outside snapping the lock letting himself in and closing it as quietly as he can behind them
he looks around spotting amy lying in the corner
quick grab her and lets get out of gr rev
he falls to his knees beside amy and rolls her over for peter to see
she is still covered with sweat and trembling even more violently now
her upper lip slips back revealing lengthening fangs just the beginning of red in the iris
peters eyes widen in horror
i jerry pauses in his labor to stare up at the ceiling in the direction of the bedroom two floors above his ear cocked
billy looks at him
we have a visitor
he puts down his shovel heading for the stairs billy following him
charley glances up from amys trembling body to look at peter
is it too late to save her
not if we kill dandrige before dawn
subjective camera cranes upoff a basement window up the side of the house past the living room window and up and up the voices in jerrys bedroom getting louder and
louder as jerry approaches
are you sure
so far everythings just like in the movies
well just have to keep on hoping
and the camera stops outside the bedroom window watch ing as charley grabs the stake dandrige dropped on the floor and heads for
a lets go he and peter hurry out the door the camera watching them go
they come out of the bedroom and start
down the steps only to find themselves facing billy cole coming up the other way
as billy stops a slow smile sliding across his grim features
well what do we have here
he starts up the steps
peter pulls a pistol one of the props from his apartment from his pocket
stop or ill shoot
billy stops still smiling at him
their eyes locked for what seems like an eternity
then billy starts up the stairs toward him again
peter points the gun at billy with trembling hands
i mean it
dont force me to billy reaches out his huge hands for peters throat
peter fires the bullet punching a neat hole through billys forehead
the large man freezes his eyes rolling back in his skull
be stands there for a moment and then tumbles backward down the stairs landing with a crash at the bottom
suddenly there is the sound of approaching footsteps on the balcony above
peter and charley whirl staring up at the landing above them
a second later jerry dandrige steps out of the shadows
with a smile he starts down the stairs toward them
charley steps forward thrusting his cross up at dandrige
dandrige freezes his face darkening with fury
charley starts up the steps peter close behind him
come on we have him dandriges gaze snaps past charleys shoulder down into the shadows at the bottom of the stairs where billys body lies his eyes glowing as they
burn into the corpse for a moment before shifting back to charley and peter
he smiles at the boy
he steps back into amys room disappearing from sight
peter looks at charley
what did he mean
hes just bluffing
charley continues up the stairs slowly the cross held out in front of him peter hugging his back
behind them down at the foot of the stairs billy slowly sits up
peter and charley continue climbing their gazes fixed ahead
behind them billy stands and starts to walk up the stairs toward them the first step he hits groaning under his heavy weight
charley and peter freeze turning to look back
they see the huge man coming up the stairs toward them a thin trail of blood leaking from the bullet hole in his forehead
peter whips his pistol out with trembling hands and unloads the entire revolver into the man casting a pale of gunsmoke in front of him and charley obscuring their view
of the stairway below
suddenly billy cole appears through the thick cloud back ing them up the stairs
peter stumbles falling backward unable to rise in time
billy leans down grabbing him and jerking him into the air like a ragdoll
about to fling him over the ballustrade to the floor far below
charley suddenly leaps forward slamming his stake into the creatures heart
billy cole freezes his eyes widening
be drops peter crashing to the steps and staggers back grabbing the rail for support hanging there below peter and charley for what seems an eternity the stake protruding from
as the two watch in horror coles face slowly begins to dissolve skin putrefying and slipping away revealing the grinning skull beneath the process of dissolution acceler ating as the
seconds tick past
suddenly the legs turn to bone and
what remains of the body no more than a skeleton in clothes now tumbles backward down the stairs with a clatter to land with a crash on the floor below
bones rolling in every direction across the portico
they stare down the stairs at his remains
in a hoarse whisper be wasnt human
no he certainly wasnt
peter scrambles to his feet heand charley backing hurriedly up the stairs terrified by what theyve seen
amys room night they rush into amys room peter stopping to stare at the open window left that way by dandrige when he entered and left
charley ignores it hurrying to amy and kneeling by her side
he gently turns her over to expose lengthening bicuspids as peter sticks his head out the window
her irises are now more red than before signaling the trans ition she is making from the living to the walking dead
peter glances down searching for jerry as above him clinging flat to the wall like a fly is jerry
the vam pire smiles slowly drawing back his clawed hand to tear peters throat out when the man cranes his neck to look over his shoulder
he is just about to when charley calls to him from the room within
peter ducks in just as jerrys about to strike
charley looks up from amys unconscious body at peter
cmon were running out of time the two men rush out of the room
the subjective camera does a degree turn staring in through the window out the open door onto the balcony
sees peter and charley standing out there hears their voices
where is he
the camera begins to drift up the side of the house toward the attic window above
charley and peter there staring about
suddenly they hear footsteps on the floor above
they stare up at the ceiling
hes in the attic
they rush to the attic door the two men disappearing up the dark stairs
they come up the staircase to find themselves enclosed in darkness
peter pulls out a flashlight and flicks it on shining it about the musty filthy room
he pauses as rats scatter beneath the unexpected blaze
he continues to search with the flashlight picking out the remains of a ruined window at the far end the glass shat tered the window itself flung wide open
well he was here the beam moves on only to suddenly stop on a large chest shoved in a corner
there his coffin
both of them approach staring down at the long chest
peter hands the flashlight to charley pulling a stake from his pocket a hammer from his belt
he raises the stake in the air the hammer ready
he nods at the coffin
open i t
charley throws his shoulder against the lid heaving
the lid opens with a groan peter about to stab down only to find it empty
almost in despair god damn him
where is he
the subjective camera stares in at them then slowly be gins to drift up the side of the house toward the roof above
the camera goes up onto the roof and down around the chimney to discover jerry sitting there as though hes just alighted
charley and peter stare up at the beams overhead as dust trickles down the thud of jerry landing above them on the roof still loud in their ears
well now we know where he is
yeah but whats he doing up there
jerry sits on the roof squatting there like some huge nocturnal bird of prey his eyes closed his lips moving in a whisper
amy lies on the floor hardly moving now
suddenly she groans and rolls over throwing a hand over her face as though trying to ward off some particularly terrible night mare
dandriges face darkens even more in concentration
amy awake i command you to awake
amys eyes slowly open
theres not a vestige of human life in them
she blinks and her eyes go completely red glowing in the dark
dandriges voice fills her
mind like distant thunder
now show me how much you love me amy kill them both
she rises and moves like a zombie messenger of death toward the door to the hallway and the attic above
charley and peter are still staring up at the attic ceil ing above the waiting becoming unendurable for charley
im going up there
he heads for the open window at the far end of the attic nearest the stairs
he takes a step after the boy but hes too late
charley is already out the window
charley climbs onto the roof a cross in his hand a stake in the other
the roof looks deserted but hidden behind the chimney stands jerry waiting for the boy
unaware of the danger
charley reaches the chimney and stealthily be gins to circle it sensing danger the cross and stake in hand
he suddenly reaches the side where last we saw jerry only to find no one there
he stands there puzzled looking about
calling up from the attic below do you see him
peter stands alone at the far end next to the coffin ner vously talking
where the hell is he
and in the window directly behind his back jerry rises up out of the dark no more than a few feet away only a thin pane of glass separating peter
from his clawed hand
he raises it to strike through the glass at peter just as charley slides in the open window at the far end from the roof and sees jerry in the
window behind peter
he screams out
peter behind you
peter whirls holding up his cross and as quickly as he appeared from the night jerry slips back into it leaving peter staring at the window terrified at the close
call as charley reaches his side
peter nods numbly as a huge shadow rises up along the staircase wall at the far end of the attic behind them a shadow that suggests jerry is coming up
the stairs from the floor below toward them
a stair creaks behind them and charley and peter whirl to see amy step out of the stairwell
she looks incred ibly beautiful as though somehow her moment with dandrige has transformed her from virginal girl to a full grown woman dripping with sensuality
charley steps forward about to rush into her arms
charley looks at amy as she clears the steps and turns to ward them
peter shines his flashlight into her face
the eyes glow red the face lifeless fangs larger now than before protruding
from her upper lip
oh my god suddenly they hear dandrige cruelly laughing at them from the floor below laughing like this is the best joke hes ever heard
hes downstairs now amy suddenly launches herself at charley seizing
him by the throat and throwing him to the floor landing on top of him
he grabs her by the shoulders holding her back as she tries to plunge her fangs into his neck
peter steps up behind her a stake raised in his hands about to plunge it into her back
charley screams up at him
peter shifts his grip on the stake holding it like a club and brings it slamming down on her back
she collapses un conscious on top of charley
he shoves her off climbing to his feet and turning toward the staircase to the floor below
come on pk rev
the two men plunge down the stairs
a second later amy rolls over her eyes snapping open perfectly conscious again
she slowly rises
the two men come out of the stairway peter turning back to lock the attic door behind him
charley starts for jerrys room
peter grabs him
you take downstairs ill take up charley plunges down the stairs to the portico below as peter disappears into the bedroom searching for dandrige
the subjective camera watches as charley heads down the stairs peter turning for jerrys room the camera craning off the window and down around the side of the house picking
up charley up through the front windows as the boy disappears down the first floor hall in search of jerry jerry watching him the entire time from outside the front of the house
the front door slowly begins to open that strange killing hand of jerry holding the doorknob all thats seen of him as he obviously prepares to slip inside
peter freezes as he hears the front door creak and turns racing out the bedroom door onto the balcony
peter comes to a halt at the top of the stairs peering down at the portico below
he calls out panic struck
charley comes running down the hall stopping at the bottom of the stairs staring up at peter
what is it
sighing in relief i thought i heard something
the subjective camera stares in at them then starts to move across the porch and up the side of the house as charley speaks to peter
the camera passes jerrys bedroom window catching a glimpse of peter on the balcony just as he replies to charley
i dont know
just my nerves i guess
behind peter there is suddenly a pounding at the attic door
its amy trying to get out
peter stares wor riedly at the attic door as the pounding from within be comes more violent
suddenly all the clocks on the wall below go off signaling that its a
dawn time for jerry to go to bed
peter takes his eyes off the clocks as the last chime dies looking at charley over the balustrade
keep searching for him
ses got to be close
its almost dawn
charley heads back down the hallway toward the basement as above on the landing peter stares around about to try another door when suddenly the huge stained glass window directly
behind and above him bursts apart in an explosion of shattering glass and jerry dandrige plunges in from the outside landing in a crouch before peter
he rises as the
older man backs away
charley rushes down the hail back into the portico brought by the sound of the crash
hes about to start up the stairs when dandrige turns and stares down at him
charley ignores him starting up the stairs
peter speaks to him never taking his gaze from dandrige
stay there charley charley freezes staring up at the vampire and the man above watching waiting
dandriges gaze bores into peter
just the two of us at last
he takes a step for peter
peter whips out a cross thrusting it at him
dandrige stops smiling at him
he starts for him again peter holding his ground the cross thrust out in front of hiin
you have to have faith for that to work mr
peter continues to hold his ground the cross held up higher staring defiantly back at dandrige refusing to drop his gaze
and then it happens the vampire jerks to a halt staring with slowly dawning fury at peter real izing by whatever invisible force it is emanating from that cross that
indeed peter has recovered his faith
he stands there stymied snarling at the man
peter peers over his shoulder out the ruined window
on the horizon the first pink tendrils of dawn are breaking
now its peters turn to smile as he shifts his gaze back to dandrige
look over your shoulder
dandrige cranes his neck to see the rising dawn through the open window the sun beginning to glint its golden rays even as he stares at it
he turns back to peter roaring with fury
peter picks up his stake and dives for the vampire dandrige is too quick for him
he throws himself off the landing tucking his body into a somersault as he hurls through the air toward the portico floor below turning into a whirling ball of spinning
flesh only to suddenly emerge from it no longer a man but now an enormous bat
the bat straightens in midair above the portico and zooms down the hallway smashing into charley chest high blowing him off his feet as his claws rake the boy sending
two bloody furrows down his chest as the bat whips past him and disappears down the hallway into the darkness
peter recovers above hurrying down the stairs to the portico below
he rushes to charleys side helping the badly shaken boy to his feet
are you all right
amy begins pounding at the attic door
the two men look up as it begins to splinter
quick hes in the basement
he helps the boy
down the hall the two of them disappear ing through the basement door
a second later the attic door above rips from its hinges crashing to the floor
amy steps out of the attic her eyes sightless a stake grasped in her hand
she walks like an automaton down the stairway toward the portico below
charley anaa peter hurry down the stairs into the dark room its windows covered with blackout drapes
the floor is a mass of antiques row after row of them many covered with dust cloths
peter dives for the first one ripping the cloth off only to discover an armoire
he rushes to the next one
quick his coffin has to be here they race down the aisle continuing to rip dust covers away only to discover a line of mirrors several of them obviously removed
from pieces in the house above
they stop staring at them
well now we know what he did with the mirrors the door to the stairway creaks open behind them lost somewhere in the dark
peter whirls looking back the way they just came
what was that
you keep searching
ill check it out
but charley has disappeared into the darkness before peter can stop him
charley appears down the row of antiques stopping at the foot of the stairs and staring up at
the basement door above
it is partially open allowing just a sliver of light into the darkness
he calls out clutching his stake nervously
whos there amy appears out of the darkness behind him slowly
approaching her face deathly white her lips blood red her eyes almost glowing in the dark
he hears her at the last second whirling to face her with a gasp
she reads the fear on his face and smiles sadly reaching out a hand to him
dont be frightened charley
she takes a step closer and he steps away
amy stops staring at him then she slowly begins to advance on him unbuttoning her blouse her voi ce a husky purring whisper
charley i love you he backs away she keeps coming closer exposing more and more of her body whats wrong charley dont you want me anymore
he suddenly breaks her spell coming to his senses and whip ping out his cross thrusting it
in her face
she whirls away with a snarl burying her face in her hands softly beginning to weep
its not my fault charley
you promised you wouldnt let him get me you promised
he stares at her guilt boiling up inside of him
he steps forward touching her shoulder letting the cross drop to his side
she whirls huge fangs flashing dripping hungry saliva and dives for his exposed throat
he whips the cross up butnot in time her forearm smashing into his wrist sending the cross whirling away into the darkness
amy straightens smiling at him the
huge fangs sparkling in the light from the open doorway above
she begins to walk toward him her sexual interest in charley gone replaced by mad driving hunger
at the other end of the room peter desperately weaves his way among the pieces of furniture dotting the floor looking for the coffin
he stops before a huge armoir whips it d own to discover it empty and is about to move on when he glances down
there at the corner of the armoir is a small hole with rats scurrying in and out
realizing something must be behind the huge piece of furniture he shoves it aside toppling it crashing to the floor
a hidden alcove more a dais than anything else is revealed a huge window at the back covered with a blackout curtain and jerrys ornate brassbound coffin sitting in the
middle covered with chattering crawling rats
peter stares at it horrified calling out into the darkness behind him
charley i found it back at the other end of the room charley is backing away from amy as she slowly stalks him the stake she picked up in the
attic in her hands
charley yells back at peter
get it open
she suddenly leaps for him
stabbing with the stake only to miss him by inches sending it plunging through the back of a chair with her growing strength shattering it against the stone wall behind
she turns on charley empty handed now continuing
to stalk him
before the dais peter stifles his revulsion of the rats and leaps forward rushing to the side of the coffin and fumbling with the clasps only to discover theyre locked
he cries out again
he s locked it somehow from the inside
he grabs a hammer from his pocket and starts pounding at the clasps trying to free them while at the side of the room charley continues to back away from
amy calling back
he goes to dodge amy when she leaps forward shoving a bureau across his path blocking his escape
she smiles at him continuing to back him into a corner
back at the coffin the clasp finally comes loose beneath peters pounding and he moves to the next one smashing at it with the hammer desperately
back at the side of the room charley dodges amy leaping over a pile of refuse in his desperation to escape the girl vampire diving after him her fingers clawing
into his back and shredding his shirt as he twists out of her grasp
back at the dais peter breaks the last clasp throws the coffin lid open sees jerry resting beneath him the king vampires eyes closed
he fumbles a spare stake from his belt pressing it to the creatures heart about to slam it home with the hammer when suddenly behind him charley crashes into view
on the floor amy fixed to his back rising over his struggling to sink her fangs in his neck
peter whirls at the noise momentarily distracted
in the coffin jerrys eyes snap open fixing on peter
with a snarl he sits right up in the coffin behind peter the man turning back only to find himself face to face with the enraged vampire
jerry opens his mouth about to kill him when peter slams it home missing his heart and impaling his shoulder
the old actor falls back as the vampire rises out of his coffin the stake protruding from his shoulder amy stopping in her struggle to kill charley both she and
the boy staring
up at the huge vampire looming over all three
with superhuman deliberation dandrige pulls the stake from his chest and hurls it away
it smashes into a far wall splintering a window sending a thin ray of light into the room
dandrige turns on peter his face con vulsed with hatred
he leaps for him smashing him into a wall about to sink his fangs into peters neck as charley watches
he desperately leaps around amy reaching for the blackout curtain covering the window at the back of the
she jumps after him grabbing him just as his fingers close around the curtain
she pulls him to the floor her mouth open about to sink her fangs in him as the drape comes with him tearing from the window and sending a huge
bolt of sunlight streaming into the dank room
it hits jerry dandrige squarely in the back whirling him away from peter picking him up and throwing him across the room slamming him into the far wall pinning him
there several feet above the floor
he writhes in the golden beam twisting this way and that but unable to escape as his body slowly begins to smoulder a million small fires breaking out all over
him as begins to burn
as peter and charley watch unable to tear their eyes
away the vampires body suddenly explodes in a whooshing ball of flame that incinerates him instantly leaving nothing behind but the echoing scream of a soul finally going to hell
amy rolls off of charley moaning
he turns to her
she slowly opens her eyes the girl he knew staring back at him her fangs gone
she throws herself in his arms weeping softly
he holds her close staring across the room at peter who sits beside the coffin wiping dandriges
blood from his face and mouth with his handkerchief nothing but silence in the room now the sun shining mer rily through the window only a few wisps of charcoal
floating lazily through the air to remind any of them what just happened
the dandrige house is dark a for sale sign prominently displayed on the front lawn
the house itself now seems innocuous and ordinary free forever of the evil that once dwelt within
the brewster house next door is lit and gay much as it was on the first night we saw it
the tv can be heard coming from the house
and now fright night starring peter vincent
charley and amy lay on his bed making out like crazy the tv tuned in to fright night just as it was the first evening we met them
they break for a moment as peter vincent comes up on the screen
this is peter vincent once more back with you as host of fright night
i thought id let the vampires rest for a little while
winking into camera right charley
back into his host tonight the threat comes not from beyond the grave but from beyond the stars as alien beings stalk an unwary summer camp in mars wants flesh
i do not star in it
amy turns back to charley the two of them staring at each other obviously deeply in love
then she slowly begins to undress
smiling he rises inadvertently turning to his window as he takes his shirt off much as he did the first night
there in jerrys window looking back at him are a pair of red glowing eyes
he looks at the window again
the eyes are gone
behind him amy looks at him questioningly
charley is something wrong
with a quizzical shake of his head charley slams the window shut and turns to her
he jumps into bed with her the two of them beginning to make love as the camera pans off them to the window pushing out through the window closing in
on jerrys window across the way
a pair of red eyes stand there in the darkness staring and staring as the camera moves closer and closer
theyre for real there is another vampire out there and he is watching charley
