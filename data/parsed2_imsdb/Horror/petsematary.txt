href b b pet sematary by stephen king by stephen king that most persistent summer sound crickets in high grass ree ree ree ree
this in dark which slowly its a plywood cross leaning aslant
written on the crossarm in black paint which has faded smucky he was obedient
the letters are faded
they are also straggling and ill formed the work of a child
a childs printing again this time on a chunk of warped crating
i think all these shots are lap dissolves
all is silence but for the crickets and the wind stirring the grass
around the markers themselves the grass has been clipped short and by some markers there are flowers in cheap vases
crisco cans skippy peanut butter jars etc
these two markers in memory of marta our pet rabit dyed march on a wide flat board and gen patton our
april another board
we cant read all of them some are too faded or the gravestones themselves too degenerated but we can see now that this woodland clearings a rather eerie and well
populated animal graveyard
we can see polynesia and hannah the best dog that ever lived
hannahs tombstone is part of an old chevrolet hood painstakingly hammered flat
from here we can see most of the clearing which is surrounded by forest pines
we can see that the graves maybe in all are arranged in rough concentric circles
on the far side of this clearing is the end of a path which spills into this graveyard clearing
the end of the path is flanked by wooden poles which hold up a crude arch
we can see no writing on this side the words on the arch face those arriving along the path
main titles conclude
written on the arch in faded black paint is the work of some long gone child pet sematary
down to look through the arch
from this angle we are looking across to a deadfall a tangle of weather whitened old dead branches at the back of the graveyard
its maybe twenty five feet from side to side and about nine feet high
at either end are thick tangles of underbrush that look impassible
as main titles conclude the camera moves slowly in on the deadfall
and as it does we realize that there is a horrible snarling face in those branches
is this an accident
perhaps the audience will wonder
the camera holds on it and then we black
and a white title card moving day
sound of crickets ree ree ree ree
to the left of this house a big empty field
behind it the woods
before it a wide two lane road
the house is a pleasant two story new england dwelling with a shed garage attached
in front of it is a sign which reads quinn realtors hammond street bangor
a big sold strip like a bumper sticker has been plastered across it diagonally
growing sound the rumble of a truck
a big big truck
it belts between the camera and the house a tanker truck with a silver body and the word orinco written on the side in blue letters
its short stack is blowing quantities of dark brown smoke
behind it comes a ford wagon which slows signals and turns into the driveway of the house weve been looking at
as louis creed brings it to a stop we get a good look at the license plate illinois and a bumper sticker have you hugged the engine sound stops
for a moment or two we hear only the ree ree ree ree of crickets
then ellie creed voice is this our new house daddy
louis creed voice this is it
the two front doors and one back door open
louis creed about gets out from the drivers side
rachel creed his wife gets out from the passenger side
from the rear door comes ellie creed a girl of
they are staring fascinated at the house
they come together the three of them by the front of the wagon still staring at the house
louis is clearly nervous
what do you think
rachel begins to smile
she turns to louis and hugs him
am i really gonna have my own room
she looks toward the side lawn and sees a tire on a rope hanging down from the bough of a tree
ellie to rachel is that a swing
yes but the rope might be yaay
she goes running toward it
rachel gives louis a tired smile
let her go
louis the house is beautiful
they kiss gently at first then more passionately
as he draws her more tightly against him a baby gage begins to cry from the car
louis and rachel break the clinch
the master of disaster awakes
this sound is joined by the unhappy yowling of a pent up tomcat
and buckaroo banzai
come on lets parole em
they walk to the car rachel going to one of the back seat doors louis to the rear of the wagon
gage is sitting in his car seat not exactly crying but certainly yelling to be let out
the seat dash and floorboards are littered with roadmaps soda cans big mac boxes and similar crud
these folks have driven all the way from chicago to maine in this station wagon and the wagon looks it
decided to wake up and see what home looks like huh
she begins to unbuckle the straps and harnesses
gage is just wearing a t shirt and a diaper
hes fifteen months old
he opens the doorgate and lifts out a cat carrier
we see a big tomcat inside mostly what were aware of are shining green eyes
ellie voice daddy
i see a path
louis cat carrier still in hand turns toward shes got it penduluming back and forth in long wide arcs
we see the field and a clearly marked and mown path leading up its flank and into the dark woods
the camera dips and pendulums as ellie swings
rachel irritated not so high ellie
you dont know how strong that rope is
she puts gage down
he totters a bit on his little legs and then stands there looking at his sister
the bark has rubbed off the branch it looks like a bone peeping through decayed flesh
the rope is old discolored
and it is fraying away as we look at it
soon ellie like humpty dumpty is going to have a great fall
hes set the cat carrier down and is straightening up
ellie raptuous voice wheee
ellie you heard your m his eyes widen
wh sound a heavy twang
as the rope breaks
the tire swing with ellie still inside it goes crashing to the grass
ellie screams and begins to cry a little hurt and a lot surprised
louis and rachel run to her
are you all right
are you okay
ellies parents reach the tangle of tire rope and six year old girl
anyone who can scream that loud isnt ready for intensive care just yet looks like she just skinned her knee
nevertheless he begins to rapidly disentangle his daughter from the tire
hes standing in the driveway by the front of the car utterly forgotten in the heat of the moment
his diaper is sagging quite a bit the boy needs a change
he stares toward the scene of the accident for a bit then loses interest
camera follows as he walks down the side of the station wagon little bare feet slapping on the asphalt
he stops for a moment at the back looking at the cat carrier which louis never got around to opening
church is staring hopefully out through the mesh
gage bends down and tries to open the cat carriers door
either he cant solve the latch or his fingers dont have the strength
anyway he stops trying after a moment
sound growing thunder of an approaching truck a big one
a big tanker truck silver body orinco written on the side in blue letters blasts by
the windlash if the passing truck blows gages hair back from his forehead
we should be scared here not by the truck but by gages lack of fear
hes smiling happy
he starts down the driveway toward the road
ellie has been disentangled from the swing
shes sitting by the wreckage at the end of the driveway weeping hysterically as much from tiredness as from pain i think as louis and rachel examine her scraped knee
the wound doesnt look too serious
louis to rachel would you get the first aid kit
ellie screaming not the stingy stuff
i dont want the stingy stuff daddy
rachel suddenly looks around toward no one there
jesus the road
they get up together
a truck is coming
a great big one
the grille looks like a tombstone thats learned how to snarl
he takes a step into the road
and then big gnarled hands grab him
gage looks rather surprised at this but not worried this kid is used to being picked up and treated humanely
to gage strangers are as interesting as
well as interesting as orinco trucks
the fellow who has picked gage up is a man of about eighty in old blue jeans a faded bruce springsteen t shirt
over this he wears a faded khaki vest with bright silver buttons
his face is deeply wrinkled and kindly
jud crandall to gage no you dont my friend not in that road
but he softens this with a grin
gage grins back at him
jud low no shit sherlock
jud carries him up the driveway to the station wagon
here hes joined by louis and rachel out of breath and really scared
ellie brings up the rear
shes still sniffling
jud hands him to her he was headed for the road looked like
i corralled him for you missus
thank you so much
im louis creed
he sticks out his hand and jud shakes it
louis takes it easy no crushing jaycees grip or anything like that the old guy looks as if he might have arthritis
i live just across the road
thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy here
no harm no foul
but you want to watch out for that road
those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night
he leans over toward ellie
who might you be little miss
im ellen creed and i live at alden lane dearborn michigan
pause at least i used to
and now you live on route in ludlow and your dads gonna be the new doctor up to the college i hear and i think youre going to be just
as happy as a clam here ellen creed
ellie to louis are clams really happy
they all laugh even gage
excuse me mr
crandall ive got to change this kid
its nice to meet you
come over and visit when you get the chance
as rachel carrying gage moves away ellie worries daddy do i really have to have the stingy stuff
no i guess not
she goes belting off
jud amused i guess your daughter there aint going to die after all
louis also amused i guess not
house has stood empty for too long
its damn good to see people in it again
sound a truck engine gearing down
it blinks and comes lumbering into the creeds driveway
hey they actually found the place
movin ins mighty thirsty work
i usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over mdinner
come on over and join me if you want
well maybe i rachel voice louis whats this
gage has been changed and rachel is following him as he explores the nearest edges of the new homestead
they are fairly close to the wreckage of the tire swing and here is the head of the path ellie has already glimpsed
they cross to the van
the first and second movers are just climbing out of the van
just a second
shes holding gage on her hip now and both of them are looking at that strange and oddly enticing path which disappears into the deepening twilight
louis and jud join them
the movers yes i know
this path louis
where does it go
i dont have the slightest idea
when i saw the house this field was under four feet of snow
rachel smiling i bet mr
he smiles too but underneath the smile we sense that he is serious
its a good story and a good walk too
ill take you up there sometime and tell you the story too after you get settled in
he smiles at them and they smile back it is a look of understanding and real liking in spite of the age difference between the creeds and jud
ree ree ree ree
theres one light upstairs one downstairs
perhaps we see the path glimmering away into the field
either by virtue of it being mown or by virtue of some gentle optical trick
theres a light on in the kitchen but it just casts a dim glow in here
the room has a fireplace and a lovely wooden floor
its going to be nice but now its just a big bare box with movers cartons stacked all over the place
louis is drinking a can of pepsi and he looks pretty damned tired anyone whos ever moved house and can remember the first night in the new place will understand
he finishes the last of the pepsi and surveys the living room
he sits on one of the bigger boxes takes cigarettes from his pocket and lights one
he drops the spent match in the empty can and taps into the can during the scene
sound feet coming down the stairs
the door on the far side of the room opens and rachel comes in wearing a nightgown
rachel crossing to louis kids are asleep doc
he hugs her
she hugs him back warmly for a moment they are just two good people in all the big darkness of their new house
youre not really going over to have a beer with that old guy are you
well ive got a million questions about the area and and youll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and did you see his shirt
rachel giggles sure
i really do have a million questions about the area
but the thing im really curious about is how come this octogenarian yankee is decorating the slumped remains of his pecs with the boss
pervasive sound of the crickets as louis comes rather hesitantly up the crazy paved path from the roads edge
jud voice that you doc
we hear the squeak of a rocker we see the dim red fitful glow of juds pall mall
we see by its glow that he is wearing walkman earphones
the walkman is in his lap
he switches it off and puts the headphones casually around his neck like a kid
well come on up and have a beer
louis comes on up
jud has got a pail of ice beside his chair with some cans of beer in it
he opens one and hands it to louis
you need a glass
not at all
good for you
louis drinks half the can at a draught
god thats fine
aint it just
the man who invented beer louis that man was having a prime day for himself
what were you listening to
the eat a peach album
god they were good before drugs and bad luck caught up with them
listen to this louis
he passes the headphones over
louis puts them on
jud presses the walkmans play button
sound ramblin man blasts us out of our seats
louis winces and rakes the spidery earphones off his head
he turns it down
louis puts the earphones back on and listens for a few moments
its the instrumental break
gregg and duane allman dueling hot fenders
louis takes the earphones off
i like rock and roll
i guess thats too mild
i love it
since my ears started to die out on me its the only music i can really hear
and since my wife died
i dunno some times a little rock and roll fills up night
not always but sometimes
pause one more time welcome to ludlow
hope your time here will be a happy one
louis great sincerity thank you mr
he drinks again they both do
theres a moment of companionable silence here broken by the sound of a big truck
they look toward one of those big tanker trucks goes rumbling by now there are little amber running lights on top of it
its going fast too sweeps by in a blast of air
louis wincing jesus
jud lights a cigarette thats one mean road all right you remember that path your wife commented on
the one that goes into the woods sure
that road and those orinco trucks are the two main reasons its there
whats at the end of it
jud smiles another day after you get settled in a bit
meantime doc here jud raises his glass in a toast
jud continues heres to your bones
louis clinks his glass against juds
louis crosses from the crandall side to his own and the camera follows as he walks slowly up the driveway and past the wagon
he pauses for a moment looking thoughtfully hopefully at his new house
then something the cry of an owl perhaps draws his attention the other way
toward the path
he walks to its head and stands looking out at it it glimmers in a wide cut swath thats a bit ghostly in the dark
a shape suddenly lurches out of the high grass at him and louis recoils with a startled muffled cry
the cat sure who or what else
we see his big green eyes in the dark as he cries his strange feline hello waow
god you scared the life out of me
louis bends and picks up the cat
as he does that truck sound comes again and he looks toward another orinco tanker drones by fast
louis to the cat i know one thing that will keep you home good buddy
he starts toward the house
and in that blackness we see a second title card the dead written on it is monday
church spayed a
quentin jolander d
and below in even bigger letters
ellies the camera pans left showing us the kitchen
there are still a few cardboard cartons around but the place is getting in shape
we look out the window and see the creeds led by jud crandall climbing the path toward the woods
louis has got gage in a gerrypak
they are also at the edge of the woods
jud stops and lets them catch up
take a look behind you
they turn around and their faces express their wonder
it is indeed beautiful
the creed house is in the f
route just behind it with one of the ever present orinco trucks droning along but behind that is the great sweep of the penobscot river valley dozing under a fall
sky of clear blue
you folks ready to go on
but where are we going mr
youll see soon enough hon
they go into the woods still following the path
these are old woods indeed huge trunks with dusty sunlight shafting through them
it looks as though man has never made his mark here
the camera pans slowly down to them on the path
here it is carpeted with pine needles but it is just as clearly marked
louis looks glad of the rest hes sweating and there are wide dark patches under his arms where the gerrypaks straps are
who owns the woods up ahead
the micmac indians
whats up ahead is all thats left of their tribal lands
ellie giggling micmac ricmac kickmac sickmac
jud smiles ayuh its a funny word aint it
you tired of totin that yowwen yet doc
how much further is it
aw youll be okay
less than a mile
he starts off again fresh as a daisy
ellie scampers after him
louis rolls his eyes at his wife and rachel rolls hers back
then they press on
jud stopping this is the place honey
ellie is of course second
se tries to read the words on the arch but cant
she whips around to look at her mother
whats it say mommy
a strange expression has come over rachels face she doesnt like this
not a bit
it says pet cemetery hon
its misspelled but
thats what it says
she runs for the arch
rachel starts looks more uneasy than ever
shes almost under the arch
she looks back questioning
rachel a bit lame be careful
she goes racing into the pet sematary
jud lights a cigarette with a wooden match using his thumbnail
i told you it was a bad road louis its killed a lot of pets and made a lot of kids unhappy
but at least something good come of it
ellie excited voice mom
youghtta see it
she surveys the rude markers with puzzled delight then runs toward the center pausing to investigate some of the markers as she goes
we clearly see the symmetrical pattern of rings
they are walking slowly toward that rude archway
louis is extremely interested in all this but its becoming clearer and clearer that rachel is troubled
they stop and look in
how can you call it a good thing
a graveyard for pets killed in the road
built and maintained by broken hearted children
well but missus creed
it aint quite that way deah
i think its rather extraordinary
extraordinarily morbid maybe
shes growing more and more upset
jud looks at her curiously
they have to learn about death somehow now dont they missus creed
the little ones
rachel coldly why
well because ellie voice mommy
look at me
she has begun to climb it and this looks like an extremely dangerous proposition
ellie however is having the time of her life
a branch breaks under one of her feet and she switches nimbly to the next one up
jud alarmed no honey
you dont want to go climbing on that
come on down
he hurries in
she looks back at jud
its okay mr
crandall the branch shes on breaks with a dry crrrack
her foot drops down suddenly
she totters backward pinwheeling her arms and jud catches her as she falls
not much of a catch because she wasnt too far up
louis joins jud and ellie
gage jounces along on his back
have you got a death wish ellen
well i thought it was safe best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this ellie sometimes they bite
her discomfort makes one thing very clear she doesnt want to come in
rachel calls is she all right louis
louis calls back fine
come and see
rachel calling i think ill sit this one out doc
i want to look around daddy may i
for a little while
jud looks toward rachel has retreated a bit
she sits on the pine needle carpet of the path opens her purse and draws out cigarettes
jud looks at louis as if to say whats all this about
louis looks away
ellie voice dad
she runs from one tombstone to the next cheerful as maybe only a kid could be in such a place
she looks at biffers tombstone at they are walking slowly toward her
louis is looking at the tombstones
i can hardly read these
ayuh they get older as you go toward the middle
points pete lavasseurs dog is buried there
points the stoppard boys racing pigeon that missus cowleys cat got
and i think thats the cat himself right there although its been so many years i cant tell for sure
calling missy ellen
come over here just a minute
she runs amid the tombstones they have worked their way near to the center and there are quite a few of them and joins the adults
i see youre quite a reader for such a little girl
can you read that
he points again and ellen goes over for a look see
it is a small slate marker slanted to one side
ellen reads the words laboriously tracing them with her finger
spot a good fellow we love you boy
pause owned by judson
gee i cant read the rest
last names crandall little missy
louis looks at him sharply as ellie rejoins them
thats where i buried my dog spot when he died of old age in and
dug it good and deep
by the time i finished i had blisters all over my hands and a hell of a crick in my back
soils stony up here
ellie looks awed
louis looks a little awed too
jud sweeps a hand around indicating the whole sematary but is still looking at ellen
do you know what this place is ellie
oh i know you know its a boneyard but a bone aint nothing and even a whole pile of em dont amount to much
do you know what a graveyard really is
i guess not
its a place where the dead speak missy
he sees her startled uneasy expression and laughs
he ruffles her hair reassuringly
no not right out loud
their stones speak
or their markers
even if the marker aint nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a magic marker it speaks
aint that so louis
i think it is so ellie
what if you cant read whats written on there anymore
well it still says some animal got laid down here after dont it
yes and that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot
jud smiles yes
this aint a scary place ellie
its a place of rest and speaking
can you remember that
ellie a little awed yes sir
they start to walk slowly back toward the arch
its clear shes impatient and out of sorts with the whole thing
rachel calls louis can we go
this is a place where dead animals talk
crandall said so
but rachel is not amused
she doesnt like any of this
rachel soft did he
my wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind
as you may have noticed
but i believe in knowing your enemy
louis looks at him startled then decides this is a joke
jud smiles a trifle thinly
the men rejoin rachel and ellie
louis voice did we take too long
rachel curt well if suppers burned im not the one going out for pizza
they move away
the face we saw at the beginning of the movie wasnt there when the visitors were there
but its sure there now leering at us
there are two greasy boxes poking out with napoli pizza stamped on them
guess dinner was burned
the camera pulls back and we se louis sitting at the kitchen table
the table is covered with newspapers
on it louis is putting together a complicated model boat using glue and tweezers
hes wearing glasses
ellie comes in wearing a nightgown
she watches him for awhile
louis not looking around hi babe
daddy that pet sematary is there because of the road isnt it
louis looks around at her surprised
thats what i think
i heard missy dandridge tell mom when church was fixed he wouldnt cross the road so much
well its always better to take precautions but im sure church will be all right honey
rachel is coming along with some dirty dishes
she hears voices and stops listening her face troubled and afraid
ellie voice no he wont
not in the end
he wont be all right in the end no matter how you fix im
ellis has started to cry
in the end hes gonna croak isnt he
church might be still alive when youre in a high school
and thats a very long time
it doesnt seem long to me
it seems short
i think the whole thing about pets dying s s sucks
poor kids bawling her eyes out now
louis folds her into his arms and she hugs him tightly wanting his comfort
if it was up to me id let church live to be a hundred
but i dont make up the rules
ellie muffled well who does
god i suppose
but hes not gods cat
hes my cat
let god get his own if he wants one
not she breaks down completely sobbing and louis rocks her back and forth
she is crying silently
she is a dimly perceived hump in the darkness
an oblong shaft of light falls on her illuminating her more clearly
shes asleep with her teddy encircled by one arm and her thumb corked into her mouth
rachel looks at her daughter with infinite love and then quietly closes the door
louis is in his pajamas propped up on pillows on his side of the bed
there a number of medical books scattered around him and hes making notes from one as rachel comes in
shes finally asleep
she was a little over excited thats all
it was that place
that creepy cemetery up in the woods
whatever disease the kids in this town have got i dont want ellie to catch it
jesus rachel whats got into you
do you think i didnt hear her tonight crying as if her heart would break
here she is thinking church is going to die
it should be clear to us by now that despite her words rachel is much more upset than ellie was
louis slowly puts his notebook aside and caps his pen
someday church is going to die
rachel whirls on him that is hardly the point
church is not going to die today or tomorrow never mind
i can see you dont have the slightest idea what im talking about
she stalks to the bathroom which adjoins
she goes in and slams the door
he goes for the knob
louis stares at the door bewildered and upset
here comes a big orinco truck droning along headlights glaring
the headlights of the truck illuminate the room and we see louis and rachel asleep each as far over to his her own side as he she can get with
a big empty space in the middle
lights and truck sounds slowly fade
cheerful little clots of scrambled eggs are scattered all the way across the tray of his high chair it looks a little like a map of the pacific islands done
by a guy who only had a yellow crayon
now he scoops up a handful and throws them
eggs on the serving plate of toast
rachel is at the sink doing dishes we see the blackboard with its message near her
louis comes in wearing a sport coat and slacks ready for his first day on the job
and ellie is in a pretty first day of school dress
he cant help it babe
emily post is going to be beyond him for a few years
here is the cat carrier with church inside it
he waows unhappily
ellie gets down and goes across to the cat carrier
i dont want him to get his nuts cut daddy
what if he dies
louis looks shocked and amused by ellies colorful choice of words
whered you hear that
and she says its a operation
louis tries to kiss rachels mouth
she turns her head slightly so he gets her cheek instead
shes still mad
louiss amusement dies
honey church will be fine
but what if he dies and has to go to the pet sematary
she gives him a look as if to say there
now do you understand what you did
dont be silly
church is not going to die
according to what mr
crandall says the roads a lot more dangerous than the operation
church will be just the same
well almost the same and we wont have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn orinco trucks
at this rachel tightens up still more in that funny way shes actually angered by louiss reference to catburgers but under the anger we sense she is deeply shocked as
a prudish woman might be shocked by a dirty joke
for rachel thats just what death is
thats enough of that kind of talk
i just said i know what you just said
ellie clear your place
ellie goes slowly back to the table
ellie sets the plate down im scared
what if school here isnt like in chicago
im scared and i want to go h h home
ellie bursts into loud tears and puts her hands over her face
the camera follows as they go to the table to comfort ellie
youll be fine ellie
now you can be excused
go and wash your face
and church will be fine
ellie anxious do you promise daddy
you know that
dont shilly shally louis
give the little girl her promise
louis reluctantly church will be fine
she runs off cheered up
and rachel is cheered up too
thank you louis
oh youre welcome
only if some thing should go wrong while hes under the gas its a one in a thousand shot but it happens you explain to her
he gets up and leaves the table
she looks after him stunned and a little frightened
gage conversationally here durch
he picks up a large glob of scrambled eggs from his tray and throws it in the direction of the cat carrier
church is close to the mesh looking out
scrambled eggs hit the mesh driving him back surprised
the school bus pulls up red lights flashing
ellie runs toward it across the lawn with her lunch box
have a great day
louis grabs gages hand and makes him wave it
ellie climbs aboard
the red flashers go out and the bus pulls away
the station wagon is parked there
louis comes out with a heavy briefcase in one hand and the cat carrier in the other
he opens the wagons doorgate
a small car turns into the creed driveway and parks beside louis
a rather sour looking middle aged woman gets out and crosses the front of her car
her color is bad
this is missy dandridge
she looks at the cat carrier
gonna get his nuts cut yes
thank you missy for introducing that colorful phrase into my daughters vocabulary
dont mention it
she opens the passenger side door of her car and we see a big neat pile of folded sheets
she reaches for them then winces and presses her hands against her midriff for a moment as if with an attack of indigestion
louis sees this hows that belly ache of yours
missy gets the sheets no better and no worse
you ought to see a doctor about it
they always do
she starts toward the house with the sheets
rachel hurries past missy who turns to look and then goes on into the house
louis has just put the cat carrier into the back of the wagon and closed the doorgate as rachel reaches him
rachel anxious still friends doc
louis appears to consider this seriously for a moment
and then he smiles and hugs her
i was a little worried there
have a great first day at school doc
no broken bones
louis smiles not so much as a sprain
pascow is in a blanket that is being carried by three boys and one girl
they are all yelling at each other not to joggle him not to drop him
a small knot of horrified college kids moves with the bearers
pascows head is upside down to the camera which retreats ahead of the advancing students
fixed eyes stare
half of his head has been shattered inward
before the catastrophe he was a husky male of about twenty
hes dressed in a u of m muscle shirt and red jogging shorts
the camera pulls jerkily to one side allowing the bearers to mount the steps of a brick building
the lookers on break to either side
the infirmary doors open
shes the head nurse a tough old babe of about fifty
creed weve got a mess here
the bearers sweep past her and inside leaving a red smear of blood across the midriff of marcy charltons uniform
the camera will show us all we need to see but its movements will seem almost random this is like being in the hotel kitchen after sirhan shot bobby
as the students bring in pascow louis comes running followed by steve masterton his p
standing to one side are two student nurses in candystriper uniforms
theyre boggled and horrified
the camera rushes forward shoving between onlookers
louis looks at the wound
theres shattered bone and pulsing brain tissue beneath
theres a scream the girl who was carrying one corner of the blanket is having hysterics
louis to charlton get her out
get them all out
charlton puts her arms around the girl
girl struggling no
he cant die
he cant die
the camera moves back down as louis takes an opthalmascope from steve and shines it in pascows bulging fixed eyes
charlton is just pushing the last of them gawkers and bearers out the door
steve get the ambulance over here right now
hes got to go to emmc
the ambulance is at sonnys sunoco downtown getting a new muffler oh shit pascow makes a weird gargling noise
blood suddenly spurts out of his mouth
he begins to seizure
one of the candystripers shrieks
the camera jerks up to cover the student nurses
one turns and throws up on the wall
charlton rushes over
i cant look at it
i cant stand it
charlton slaps her yes you by god can
go get the hard stretcher
as they start away one helping the other down the hall and as charlton starts over to where pascow lies dying on his blanket help me hold him
they hold pascows spasming body
it wouldnt matter if we did have the ambulance
it wouldnt matter if we had the sst
pascow begins to quiet
steve go call the motor pool
marcy roll out the crash wagon
it wont i know it wont
but lets for gods sake do it by the rules
louis is alone with pascow
charlton has drawn the drapes so the doctor and the dying man have complete if temporary privacy
there wasnt even supposed to be a sprain today my friend thats what i told her
pascows fixed eyes suddenly roll and his left hand bear traps louiss right wrist
the dying man pulls him slowly but relentlessly down until their faces are only inches apart
louis recoils breaking the grip of the hand
but he cannot quite snap the grip of those bright dying eyes
blood leaks from pascows mouth
louis whispers w what did you say
pascow struggles hard to speak again
at first he can only gurgle
its not the real cemetery
long pause the soil of a mans heart is stonier louis
a man grows what he can
and tends it
louis leans forward again terrified yet needing to know
how do you know my name
pascow gurgling ill come
louis grabs pascows bloody shoulder
louis low but urgent dammit how do you know my name
louis theyre sending a pascow begins to spasm again
louis snaps help me
pascow spews more blood as steve kneels beside louis
charlton is pushing along your basic medcu goodie cart covered with emergency life saving gear
pascows spasms are weakening
louis to charlton never mind
pascows hand comes up and paws at louiss shirt leaving a bloody handprint
then it falls limply back
pascow is dead
steve will you get a sheet to cover him with
steve leaves the frame and louis stares fixedly down at the body of victor pascow
he closes the eyes
its the leading edge of maine fall sunny and wonderful
here comes louiss station wagon
as it reaches the camera it swivels to track
radio voice over tragedy struck on the first day of the university of maines fall semester when victor pascow a nineteen year old sophomore he still looks shocked by the
the dying mans bloody handprint is partly visible on louiss shirt in spite of his sport coat
louis abruptly turns off the radio and swerves over to the side of the road
it comes to a slueing shuddering stop almost going in the ditch
he said my name
i heard it
he said my name
he stares blankly through the windshield
all lights are off
louis and rachel are asleep each on his her own side of the big double
the camera moves in on louis
sound loud hollow bang
its very loud loud enough to wake the dead
louis sits up
beside him rachel sleeps on
louiss eyes widen in terror as he stares at hes exquisitely dead
now pallid as well as smashed up
come on doc
we got places to go
he is in terror
but he is also in a state of near trance
come on doc dont make me tell you twice
he glances at rachel
although pascow has spoken in a fairly loud voice and the opening door was like a bomb shes still fast asleep
louis looks back toward pascow
and then gets out of bed
hes naked except for a pair of pajama bottoms
he turns and leaves the doorway
he reaches the bedroom doorway himself and looks back at rachel is sleeping as before and louis himself is also in bed asleep although his rest is uneasy
as if hes having a bad dream
louis relieved oh
pascow voice hurry up doc
louis enters and crosses toward the door which gives on the shed garage
this door stands open
louis pauses by it
pascow low come on doc
louis goes into the station wagon is a dark hulk
louis crosses to it and stands perplexed
pascow looms softly behind him and puts an arm around him
and suddenly his face is less than an inch from pascows mutilated face
lets go doc
louis moans i dont like this dream
who said you were dreaming
he begins to move toward the garage door
after a moment louis follows him
we can see two shapes moving up the path toward the woods pascow and behind him louis
camera holds then pans down as louis passes under the arch
he looks around obviously afraid
we can see why
by starlight this is one scary place
he suddenly sees something else and now his fear is close to terror
the face is back in the tumbled branches
it yawns and snarls
he walks toward the deadfall as if hypnotized
pascows hand falls on his shoulder
louis turns terrified
he really is a dreadful mangled mess
this is the place where the dead speak
he closes his eyes
i want to wake up
i want to wake up thats all
i the door must not be opened
the barrier must not be crossed
dont go on doc
no matter how much you feel you have to
theres more power here than you know
he points at that grinning face and perhaps now there are other effects as well subtle but there
dim red light
a misty smoke drifting through the tumbled dead branches
the director will know
after a moment there is a huge grunting roar from the woods behind the deadfall it sounds like no animal weve ever heard before
there is the sound of something huge shifting and snapping a tree like a toothpick
louis has crumbled to pascows feet
his eyes are squeezed tightly shut
please i want to wake up
leave me alone
its not my fault you died you were as good as dead when they brought you in the power of this place is old and always restless
sometimes the dead do more than speak
leave me alone
radio voice another beautiful day in maine
this is michael ohara sayin that the git go aint gonna be that bad
temps are going all the way up to
we got the ramones for ludlow
as the ramones start blasting sheena is a punk rocker his eyes snap open
hes in his own bedroom
as he sits up the camera angle widens out so we can see that hes in bed alone the covers on rachels side are thrown back
after the initial confusion and fear louis looks deeply relieved he looks the way i suppose we all look upon waking up and realizing our worst dreams were only dreams
rachel calls you up doc
i got eggs down here
good d he throws the covers back and freezes
they are covered with mud and pine needles
the sheets are greased with woods muck
louiss hands enter the shot and dump a bundle of sheets into the chute
hes naked but for a towel around his waist
hes obviously fresh from the shower
he starts down to the bedroom to dress
and on it a third title card church
over this the sound of a ringing telephone
louis voice hello
theres a bowling match on tv
louis dressed in his saturday afternoon grubs jeans and a maine sweatshirt has the phone to his ear
jud crandall phone filter louis
fraid you may have a spot of trouble
louis frowning jud
hes on the phone looking out his window
did you tell me rachel took the kids back to chicago for a few days
for ellies birthday yes
i didnt go because her old man thinks im a shit and the feeling is heartily re ciprocated
theyll be back tomorrow night
jud whats this about
well theres a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn louis
i think it might be your daughters
were looking across from the creed lawn
louis waits for one of those trucks to go blasting by and then crosses
its cold and windy
downed autumn leaves fly
louis and jud stand over a small furry body like mourners
jud voice well
its lying on its belly and doesnt look much damaged
hands louiss come into the frame
he puts one hand under the cats head and lifts it so the open eyes now a dull green stare into the camera
theres some blood on its ruff
at least it dont look like he suffered
ellie will though
shell suffer plenty
from his jacket pocket he takes a green plastic garbage bag and hands it to jud
jud holds the bags mouth open on the ground while louis kind of shoves the body in
during this loved that cat pretty well didnt she
louis twists the bag shut and puts one of those plastic ties on it
then he holds it up
what a mess
you going to bury him in the pet sematary
louis a little bitter i guess thats what its there for huh
during all of this jud has grown peculiarly intense
going to tell ellie
i dont know
seems like you told me about a promise you made gage is in his high chair
ellie in her first day of school dress is in her place
louis is sitting at his own place staring hypnotized at the middle of the table where there is a large serving dish
on the dish is scrambled eggs strips of bacon and churchs corpse staring eyes bloody ruff and all
rachel impatiently dont shilly shally louis
give the little girl her promise
louis defensive that was a mistake
she doesnt like to talk about death or even think of it
her younger sister died of spinal meningitis when rachel was eight
rachel was there when it happened
i guess you could say it made a complex
cats just as dead louis
louis snaps well thats a big help
pause im sorry jud
no need to apologize
maybe when they call ill just tell ellie i havent seen the damn cat around
jud after a long pause maybe theres a better way
louis and jud cross the road from the crandall side
louis is carrying the plastic bag in one hand and a flashlight in the other
jud has a pick and shovel in one hand and a flashlight of his own in the other
evening shadows have grown long
its maybe an hour until dark
jud and louis stop near the replaced tire swing
jud has a walkman clipped to the belt of his pants and earphones slung around his neck
jud this is crazy
its going to be almost dark before we get back
its going to be dark before we even get where were going louis
but we can do it
and were going to
but does she love the cat
yes but then come on
he puts the earphones on effectively forestalling further argument and pushes the play button on the walkman
we can hear marshall crenshaw singing crystal girl
jud starts away
after a moment louis follows
the sound of crickets
ree ree ree
the sound of footfalls
faintly the sound of huey lewis and the news singing working for a living
its now almost twilight
jud and louis enter the pet sematary
louis is looking around curiously
well folks here we are in louis creed dreamland
jud snaps off the walkman and puts the earphones around his neck again
what say louis
pause do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one
were still not where were going
he walks past louis and toward the deadfall
what do you mean
the place were going is on the other side of that
he points at the deadfall
we cant climb over that
well break our necks
i have climbed it a time or two before and i know all the places to step
just follow me
dont look down
and dont stop
if you stop youll crash through for sure
im not climbing that
give me the cat
ill take care of it myself
he holds out his hand and louis sees the old man means exactly as he says
after a moment he says lets go
jud starts up one side of the deadfall and in spite of its snarled tangles he mounts as easily as a man climbing a flight of stairs
after a few second louis follows
louis low thank god my blue cross is paid up
first juds pass the camera then louiss partly obscured by the swinging cat bag
their feet unerringly find the right branches and just as unerringly miss holes which look like ankle breakers
hes grinning exhilarated
god this is amazing
there are beads of sweat on the old mans face
he looks both stern and a little scared
just dont stop and he looks down
a dead branch snaps under one of them like a gunshot and that foot plunges down maybe six inches
he lurches to the edge of balance then regains it
and dont look down
jud reaches the top and starts down the far side
louis reaches the top
louis amazed holy
in the dying glow of twilight this should be a mystic awe inspiring shot
theres no more scrub underbrush and junk pines and juniper bracken here ancient firs rise almost like sequoias
the sunset light shafts among them
this is a real forest
an old forest
and winding upward among the trees along that needle carpeted floor clearly marked by large white stones the path goes on
hes stopped on top of the deadfall still surveying all this with frank amazement
jud turns to look come on louis dont stop
louis grinning im all right
im f one of the branches snaps
louiss foot plunges
his cuff rips
were looking up at a fairly steep angle as louis staggers off balance
he steps with his other foot misses and goes flying
he does a half somersault in the air and hits the deadfall on his back the green garbage bag flying out of his hand
his flashlight also goes
white dust puffs out from under him
louis thumps to the ground nearby
jud kneels beside him
you all right
louis sits up groggily
his pants are torn
his sweatshirt is torn
his ankle is bleeding
louis dazed sure
i guess i just lost my happy thoughts for a second there
louis gets slowly up and retrieves the bag which is rather shredded now and we can see catfur through some of the rents
louis continues i shouldnt have stopped
and it does bite
he whaps the flashlight against his palm a time or two and the light comes on
satisfied he shuts it off
no you shouldnt have stopped
but you got away with it
important thing is are you sure youre all right
pause where are we going jud
youll see before long
he starts off up the path
after a moment louis follows carrying the bag
again there should be a sense of awe and mystery as they go tolling up the path into the twilight dwarfed by those ancient firs
sound of crickets low at first then up to loud ree ree ree
lots of undergrowth here and creeping ground mist too
the sound of crickets is now only a part of the soundtrack buzz of cicadas thump of frogs
louis looks frankly doubtful
this next bits like the deadfall louis you got to walk steady and easy
just follow me and dont look down
dead trees poke out of the murk like twisted hands
theres scummy water standing around tussocks covered with long grass most of it dead
theres a lot of choking underbrush
all of this fades away into a grim obscuring fog
micmacs used to call it little god swamp
is there quicksand
louis nervous joking are there ghosts
jud looks at him expressionlessly
jud starts off stepping to the first tussock
after a moment louis follows
his face is set strange
theres a lot of funny things down this way louis
youre telling me
jud still walking the airs heavier
you might see st
what the sailors call foo lights
it makes funny shapes but its nothing
he looks up and his eyes widen as he sees a faintly glowing ethereal shape hangs in the branches of one of the dead trees
it looks a bit like a corpse
in fact i think it looks quite a bit like pascows corpse
as we watch it fades
hes somewhere between being mystified and puzzled and being scared
now a weakly glowing fireball rolls slowly across the surface of the standing water toward him
and then just fades into the thick mist
its funny all right
just dont stop louis
you dont ever want to stop down here in little god
pause and you dont ever want to look behind you whatever you hear
we see them moving through the mist like wraiths jud with his digging tools louis with his light and his hefty bag coffin
the whole swamp is glowing dimly
in the extreme f
we can see firm ground sloping up
ahead is a thick white mist
and here comes jud and louis slogging through it and out of it
both of them are wet from the knees down
they head into the woods on the far side
in the book this is described as being almost a cliff but a rocky hill rising out of the woods would serve just as well
we can see steps cut into the side and two figures louis and jud toiling up them
juds panting and out of breath louis is if anything in worse shape
almost there louis
you keep saying that
this time i mean it
he tops the last step and stands on a rocky level under the stars the wind blowing his hair off his deeply lined brow
a few moments later louis joins him and stares with undisguised wonder
the top of this hill or bluff is rocky and bare but there are a number of rocky piles
but for every pile of rocks we can see there are ten littered heaps as if the neat piles had been burst apart
theres a shape to all of this and it is the shape of the pet sematary concentric circles
sound the wind blowing ceaselessly
louis awed what is this place
this was their burying ground louis
whose burying ground
the micmac indians
i brought you here to bury ellens cat
for gods sake why
i had my reasons louis
well talk later
i guess so
you want to rest a bit before you start
no im okay
will i really be able to dig him a grave
the soil looks thin
soils thin all right
but youll manage
he hands him the pick and shovel
im going to sit over yonder and have a smoke
id help you but youve got to do it yourself
each buries his own
thats how it was done then
jud walks away leaving louis with the digging tools in one hand and the flashlight in the other
after a minute louis walks out into the burying ground
sound the wind
it blows ceaselessly up here
the holes about two and a half feet deep
stubby rocks protrude from the sides
the pick comes down hits a rock at the bottom and flashes fire
he drops the pick and sticks his hurt hands in his armpits
beside him we see a low pile of rocks and earth
jud voice should be deep enough
he joins louis
hes got a lot of rocks in his arms
you think so
he notices the rocks
what are those for
those tumbled piles of rock are very obvious
doesnt look like they last long
dont worry about that
jud why am i doing all this
because its right
he walks off again
louis looks after him for a moment then kneels down
he opens it and looks in at churchs stiffening corpse
pax vobiscum church old buddy
you were a hell of a god cat
i doubt if you were worth all this aggravation but you were a hell of a good cat
he tumbles the bag containing the body into the grave and then begins pushing the stony soil over it with the spade
louiss hands come into the frame and add a final two or three stones
he looks at it for a moment and stands up
jud is right there
you did real good
louis looks at him
theres a light on in the kitchen but thats all
theres silence at first and then the phone starts ringing
louis and jud are coming down the path with their tools and their lights
they are both clearly fagged out
sound faint the telephone
he drops the tools and sprints
louis runs into the side yard
sound of the phone is louder
he runs to the door and inside
he stands there eyes inscrutable
a beat later louis enters the room
he picks it up although he already knows its too late
he listens to the sound of the dial tone and then drops it back into the cradle disgusted
he starts to dial a number from memory
jud voice louis
when you talk to em not one word about what we done tonight
sfars you know the cats still fine
after a moment he lowers it into the cradle
in the meantime keep your peace
what we did louis was a secret thing
women are supposed to be the ones who are good at keeping secrets but any woman who knows anything at all would tell you shes never seen into a mans
the soil of a mans heart is stonier louis like the soil up there in the old micmac burying ground
a man grows what he can
and tends it
during this hes come across the room to louis and dropped his hand on louiss shoulder
but no buts
accept whats done louis
what we done was right
another time it might not be but tonight it was
at least i hope to christ it was
now you make your call
but not a word about tonight
sounds boops and beeps of a touch tone telephone
then dory goldman voice goldman residence
its louis during this another sound has been growing an approaching truck
as jud gains his side of the road he looks back and we read fear on his face no matter what he said to louis hes sorry for tonights piece
a moment later a highballing orinco truck cuts between the camera and jud
hes on the phone smiling and happy
rachel voice you want to talk to the birthday girl
thatd be real fine
ellie voice hi
louis sings happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday dear ellie happy birthday to you
ellie voice that was awful daddy
yeah i know
how are things out there in chicagoland
except when mom was airing gages diaper rash he walked away and got into grampas study and pooped in grampas favorite chair
louis grinning broadly way to go gage
ellie voice what
i said thats too bad
what did you get for presents from gramma and grampa
ellie voice lots of stuff
i got two dresses
and a chatty cathy doll
shes dressed for bed in fuzzy pink pajamas
her chatty cathy is crooked in one arm
in her lap is a garfield transistor radio
and a garfield radio
hows church dad
does he miss me
the smile fades off his face
its replaced with a look of combined guilt and unhappiness
hes looking at his hands which are still dark with the dirt from churchs grave
i guess hes just fine ellie
i havent seen him this evening but rachel holding gage sits on the arm of ellies chair
well make sure you put him down cellar before you go to bed so he cant run out in the road and get greased
and kiss him goodnight for me
louis voice yuck
kiss your own cat
want to talk to gage
before he can answer she puts the phone in gages hand
ellie and rachel watch amused as gage gobbles into it
perhaps rachel encourages him to say a few words
from the telephone comes the sound of gage talking and chortling
louis is not listening
his eyes and his mind are far away
louis is raking leaves on the side lawn near the tree with the tire swing
after a moment or two of this he props the rake against the tree and starts toward the garage
he goes in
its dim in here
louis is crossing to the door which communicates to the kitchen
as he passes the station wagon he hears a cat hiss
hes on top of the car but at this point we probably dont notice the camera is so close that church looks like hes coming right down our throats
hes hissing angrily
he recoils and stumbles backward with a cry
he hits a tool rack on the wall and a lot of them fall down with a loud jangling he jumps down frightened by the noise and the camera tracks
as he goes flying out the garage door into the sunlight
he gets slowly to his feet again
hes getting over his fright but we can see hes totally freaked out by what gave him that fright
he goes to the garage door and looks out
louis calls church
grass and fallen leaves
no sign of church
hes spooning cat food into a dish
he goes to the door there should be a total of three doors in the kitchen one to the living room one to the shed garage and one which leads
louis uses this latter door now
he puts the dish of food down and sits beside it
church comes slinking out of the bushes and comes slowly toward the camera
he stops looking mistrustful
come on church
he crosses to the stoop and begins eating the food
louis to himself christ
i dont believe this
he picks church up
church miaows again he wants the food
louis wincing god you stink church
church is looking at the food trying to get out of louiss arms
in a second
he tilts the cats head back so he can get a look at churchs neck
theres some sort of mark here a clear remnant of the crash
a line of white fur or perhaps a dark red scar where no fur at all grows
louis sees something else as he lets the cats neck go
he tweezes something out of churchs whiskers
its a shred of green plastic
chewed his way out
jesus baldheaded christ he ch church suddenly claws at his face
he claps his hand to his face
church leaps for the food
louis slowly takes his hand away
there are claw marks on his cheek welling blood
he looks at the cat
the garden is a plot of about half an acre
jud comes trundling slowly along a row pushing a wheelbarrow
there are several pumpkins in it
jud is wearing old khaki gardening pants and a ramones sweatshirt
hes wearing his headphones and we can hear the romantics doing what i like about you
jud is singing along and bopping a little as much as his arthritis will allow if you can dig it
he sees a real big pumpkin stops and bends over to get it
he takes out his pocket knife and slits the pumpkin vine
he gets the pumpkin in his arms and stands up
and louis is right there kind of a cheap jump but always fun looking totally stunned
jud startled drops the pumpkin
louis reaches out and slides the phones off juds ears
what did we do
louis is sitting at the kitchen table
jud is at the fridge
jud comes back with a couple of long necked bottles of beer and opens them
i most generally dont start before noon but this looks like an exception
what did we do jud
why saved a little girl from being unhappy
drink up louis
louis drinks about half the beer
i tried to tell myself i buried him alive
you know edgar allan poe meets felix the cat
im a doctor
i know death when i see it and church was dead
he smells horrible and he uses his claws but hes alive
and i feel like im going crazy
it was that place wasnt it
it was the rag man told me about the place stanley bouchard
us kids just called him stanny b
he was half micmac himself
louis drains his beer
can i have another one
i guess it wouldnt hurt
he gets up and goes to the fridge
the micmacs used to bury their dead up there long before the whites came
he returns to the table with the beer
they buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried
then something happened
half the tribe died in a season
the rest moved on
they said a wendigo had soured the ground
spirit of the north country
not a good spirit
wendigos are great liars and tricksters according to the stories
and if one touches you
jud pauses perhaps a flustered and gathers his thoughts
maybe it really was a wendigo i aint the one to say it wasnt or maybe it was just some disease
whatever the reason those that were left moved on
but they left that place
the way it is now
jud shrugs and drinks
the time here is about
jud is wearing short pants
hes crying not in any big deal histrionic way but as if he means to keep doing it for a long time
i mean he looks really sad
jud voice i loved my dog a lot louis
when spot died i thought i was gonna die
jud is sitting on the front stoop
its the same house jud lives in now but the porch hasnt been added yet and the road is dirt rather than tar
along this road comes a horse drawn wagon stanny b
the wagons full of junk rags bottles
stuff to sell and swap
strung across the top are bells and we can hear their chiming sound
but faint like bells heard in a dream
is old and drunk
dust spumes up behind the wagon as he draws up to the crandall house and stops
he gets down almost falls takes a bottle out of his back pocket drinks and approaches jud
we can see him speaking
you and this old indian rag man stanny b
did for me what i did for you last night louis
only i wasnt alone when spot came back
juds mother is back to the camera hanging sheets on the line
the sheets billow
and suddenly pushing out from behind them quite near her is a small mongrel dog
hes covered with graveyard dirt
his eyes are red and rolling
he splashes the sheets with the muck of his passage
jud voice my mother was with me
she sees who it is what it is and backs away screaming horrified
jud voice hed got caught in bobwire that infected
you could still see the marks on him
and so we can around his neck and along the side of his head
these marks are the counterpart of the marks weve already seen on sound of juds mom screaming
like the bells these are screams heard in a dream
the boy jud comes running out dressed in a night shirt
shes cringing against the fence at the rear of the yard
spot stands in front of her swaying from side to side as if doped
juds mom dim far get your dog jud
he stinks of the ground you buried him in
come here and get your dog
she is in utter terror
juds mom terror how did your mother take it jud
how did she take it when your dog came back from the dead
juds face is a complication
hes lying to louis certainly but is he also lying to himself
yes i think so
well she was a little upset at first and thats why i thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night
you did didnt you louis
why then things should be fine
a little upset is all she was
because ill tell you jud my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown
she got used to the idea
spot lived another four years
he died peacefully in the night that second time and i buried him in the pet sematary
where his bones still lie
we see them crossing
louis voice you still havent told me why you did it
a man doesnt always know why he does things louis
i think i did it because your daughter aint ready for her favorite pet to die
ellies a little scared of death
and the main reason ellies that way is because your wife is a lot scared of death
now you just go ahead and tell me im wrong
but louiss reaction tells him hes not wrong in fact jud has hit the nail right on the head
louiss hands come into the frame and turn the spigots
he starts to undress still looking troubled
we should notice that the door behind him is firmly shut
the bathroom has no windows
the hot water is steaming
louiss hands enter the frame and turn off the faucets
sound of louis climbing in
a big sigh and an expression of exquisite pleasure
he relaxes in the hot water
after a few moments he puts a wet washcloth over his face
dont shilly shally louis
give the little girl her promise
gage is in his high chair
ellie is at her place crying
in rachels place sits victor pascow bloody and wrecked
louis sits in his place
on the platter of bacon and scrambled eggs is churchs mangled body
the door must not be opened
the barrier must not be crossed
you dont understand the washrag is slipping but it still covers his face
louis mutters im a doctor
in attendance pascow louis ellie gage in his high chair
lying in the middle of the table clotted with dirt and blood eyes staring neck a gory mess of infected wounds is spot
hes also dotted with clots of scrambled egg and bits of bacon
sometimes the dead do more than speak
rachel with great force dont shilly shally louis
the washcloth has slipped enough so we can see his eyes are closed hes dozing
to louis ellie pascow gage and the corpse of spot enters jud his eyes shocked and staring
jud to louis you do it for all the best reasons but that aint why
you do it because it gets hold of you
you do it because you have to
the washrag has worked its way down to his mouth by now
his doze is deepening hes started to snore a little
sound a splash
something has been dropped into the bath
louis opens his eyes
eyes widen in shock
a very large and very mangled dead rat floats in the bath actually brushing against louiss chest
blood has begun to stain the water
turns his head preparatory to leaping out
its mouth yawns open
it hisses showing bloodstained teeth
louis leaps from the tub
grabs a towel and begins to rub himself frantically
hes grossed out
the cat tries to arch against him and he hits it
church falls to the floor hissing
louis looks at the closed door
how the hell did you get in
he may not know that but he knows how its going to get out
he opens the door to the upstairs hall
if church doesnt go at once louis helps it with his foot
then he looks down at staring at the rat
over this the sound of jet engines
its landing gear unfolds preparatory to touching down at bangor international airport
lots of people making their way up the jetway
hes looking anxiously for his people
in one hand hes got half a dozen roses
his face lights up
here comes louiss family
ellie is a little ahead
rachel is pushing gage in his stroller
ellie sees louis and lights up
she runs for him
ellie comes belting up to louis weaving among the deplanees like a slalom skier
she leaps into his arms
louis swings her cheerfully
she smacks him noisily
he smacks her back just as noisily
daddy is church all right
louiss face changes
all at once hes watchful
i guess so
he was sleeping on the front porch when i left
cause i had a bad dream about him
i dreamed he got hit by a car and you and mr
crandall buried him in the pet sematary
louis trying to smile that was a silly dream wasnt it
is he really all right
because you promised
rachel reaches them
shes pretty tired
hair hanging in her face good travelling clothes now looking a bit wrinkled and a bit stale
want to take your son doc
gage is ecstatic
louis kisses rachel deeply
church at the door waiting to be let out
ellie does the honors
church oils out into the shed garage
ellie closes the door
she looks distressed
she crosses the kitchen again
rachel in a flannel nightgown is watching tv
louis is reading a medical tome and making notes
gage zipped into a warm blanket suit is sacking on the couch
ellie entering can cats have shampoos
yes you have to take them to someone who grooms animals though
i think its pretty expensive
ellie still upset i dont care
ill save up my allowance and pay for it
church smells bad
ive noticed it too
ill cough up the money ellen
i hate that smell
he looks both grim and sad a man discovering that what you pay for you own and what you own always comes home to you
yes i hate it too
and on it a fourth title card missy dandridge
sound a pen scratching over paper
a single sheet of lined paper is spotlighted by the glow of the desk lamp
on it missys right hand is just finishing dr
says intestinal cancer
cannot face this pain
the hand puts the pen down
it tears the paper in two leaving just the half with the message
a light comes on and we see a hangmans noose strung over a beam
it dangles above a kitchen table which has been relegated to cellar duty
sound descending footsteps
sound of missy climbing onto the table
her face enters the frame
she looks very sick
she puts her head into the noose and rakes it tight at the hyoid bone
one light on
a cellar light
sound ree ree ree
sound ree ree ree
she hangs limply hands dangling at her sides above the table which now lies upon its side
we can see the note clearly
she pinned it to the bodice of her housedress
sound car engines starting up
people are coming out and getting into their cars and turning on the headlights even though it is only mid morning
in the immediate f
is a hearse
four pallbearers are loading a coffin into it
theyre all turning on their lights
daddy why are they all turning on their lights in the middle of the day
jud dressed in a rusty old black suit and a black tie comes out and stands with them
he looks haggard and old
they do it to honor the dead ellen
is that right dad
to honor the dead
more cars start up more lights come on the back doors of the hearse swing closed
note in the book louis finds it difficult to enter at night because of a high iron fence
here we should see theres no such problem theres only a low stone wall between the graveyard and the public road
the mourners are of course gathered around the grave of missy dandridge
the coffin rests above it on runners
minister voice may the lord bless you and keep you may the lord make his face to shine upon you and comfort you and lift you up and give you
as the mourners begin to break up these three start back toward louiss car
rachel not feeling well
a touch of the flu
shes in bed
she was throwing up
ever since mrs
rogers called and said missy thats enough ellen
theyve reached the creed station wagon
out of the mouths of babes louis
this babe has said enough
he opens the front passenger door
hop in ellie
she does and louis closes the door
god i was sorry to hear
i remember when she was no oldern ellen there walking down to the store with her raggedy anne doll draggin behind her in the dust
i dont know why god takes someone like her who should have a bunch of years still in front of them and lets an old shit like me just go
on and on
my father used to have a saying jud god sees the truth but waits
how is your cat louis
its ellies cat
hes your cat now
jud opens one of the back doors as louis goes around to the drivers side
jud has tilted over in one corner and is snoring
his walkman phones are on and we can hear the tinny sounds of billy idol
a little old mans drool trickles down from one corner of his mouth
tears are spilling freely down ellies face
no more chocolate chip cookies
missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world even mom said so
now there wont be any more because shes gonna be dead forever
she cries harder
louis reaches out and strokes her hair
moving up the country road toward home through blazing fall foliage
on it is a scene from night of the living dead
bizarre as it may seem it now seems almost beyond doubt the dead are returning to eat the living
ellie voice daddy
theres a vcr on top of the tv louis has been watching night
now he quickly uses the remote control to shut down the tv
shes dressed for bed and comes toward him slowly
whats up sugar
daddy do you think missy dandridge went to heaven
shes putting away the last of the supper things
she hears this and moves toward the living room door to listen
she doesnt look at all well
her eyes are red from crying and her face is haggard
shes gotten up into his lap
at school michael mcdowell said she was gonna fry in hell
michael mcdowell says all sewersides fry in hell
well i think michael mcdowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks my dear
she smiles a little at this
but dont you dare say that
is missy in heaven do you think
i dont know honey
different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die
some believe in heaven or hell
some think were born again as little children sure carnation
like in that movie you rented audrey rose
well its actually reincarnation but you get the idea
and some people think we just wink out
like a candle flame when the wind blows hard
do you believe that
louis looks toward church is sleeping
i think we go on
im not sure what happens after we die but yeah i have faith in that
you believe in it
oh faiths a little more than just believing
louis continues ill tell you what faith is its the evidence of the heart the assurance of things not seen
i dont get it
well here we are sitting in my chair
do you think my chair will be here tomorrow
then you have faith in that
but we dont know it will be after all some crazed chair burglar might break in while were away and steal it right
shes smiling too
but tears are running down her cheeks
but we plan on that chair
we believe in that chair
and i plan on going on somehow as louis creed after i die
i believe i will
ellie awed you have faith in that
just like i have faith that it is now time for ellen creed to get ready for bed
he gets her off his lap
im not tired
im sure youre not
then why do i have to go to bed
because your mother and i need the rest sugar
she heads toward the stairs
louis is in bed reading
rachel wearing a robe over her nightgown comes in
i heard you tonight
i thought maybe you did
i know you dont approve of the subject being raised thats not true
the subject scares me
because of zelda
louis puts his book down and looks at her thoughtfully
your sister i know
rachel sits down on the end of the bed
shes clasping her hands nervously together
sometimes youre so good with her louis so straight with her that you make me ashamed of myself
louis sits up and scoots down the bed to her
he tries to put an arm around her
she rejects it but gently
im sorry i couldnt go with you to missys funeral
and that i blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard
not by me it isnt
i know how badly i acted how unfair i was
its just that i
yes i guess i do
he makes a place for her beside him and hugs her
they lie silently together for awhile taking comfort from each other
im going to try to do better
youre doing fine
and on it a fifth title card gage
sound an idling truck motor
it looks monstrous
as high as a mountain
its an orinco tanker
the driver a young man in khaki fatigues and a baseball cap climbs up into the cab
he slams the door and jams the truck into gear
irwin goldman voice i knew something like this would happen
the truck comes rolling slowly toward the main gate
stops so the driver can look both ways
and then pulls slowly out onto route
irwin voice continues i told her when you were first married
youll have all the grief you can stand and more i said
there are others here but they are in the b
and concentrating on the scene the old man is making
hes rachels dad
louis is sitting in the aisle seat of a pew like bench
he looks terribly shattered they both do actually
hes staring at the old man as if he cannot in the least comprehend what hes saying
irwin continues and now look at this
he gestures toward here half buried in floral tributes is a child sized coffin
irwin weeping run over in the road like a
getting up to speed
theres a hand holding it louiss
the kite begins to move and the camera tracks it
it flaps and flutters
he runs with the kite beneath a gorgeous fall sky in which fat clouds move like airy ocean liners
ellie voice go daddy
the remains of a picnic lunch are spread here
looks like everyone ate well
in attendance rachel ellie gage and jud crandall
they all laugh jud ruffles the kids hair
hes paying out string and the kite is going up
louis voice wheres rachel
irwin looks toward they are by the sign in book
both are dressed in black
both look haggard
but rachel looks more than haggard she looks damned near insane with grief and horror
irwin leaning forward with her mother
where she should be
as for you i hope you rot in hell
in hell do you hear me
we should by now hes screaming his head off
the driver is whistling
a transistor radio hangs from the rear view mirror on a strap
he turns it on
hey ho lets go
unrolling before us at a good clip too good maybe
stamping the pedal closer to the metal
belting toward the camera
sound of the growling engine
louis has clearly gotten it up okay
hes holding the string looking up at the sky
now he looks back at the picnic table
gage gets down and runs toward his father
belting along fast
sound of the ramones
gage runs to his dad chubby legs working
he reaches him and louis transfers thee ball of string to gages hands
youre flying it gage you got the hammer my man
gage fline it
bet your boots
look louis puts his hands over gages hands and pulls them down
it dips in the sky
gage fline it
louis tenderly bet your ass little hero
he kisses his son
they look up at dipping and drifting in that gorgeous fall sky
irwin goldman voice where were you while he was playing in the road
thinking about your stupid medical articles
you stinking shit
you killer of children
you but there is no way he can express his outrage with mere words
as louis sits staring numbly up at him irwin punches him in the nose
louis sprawls backward falling out of the pew onto the floor
rachel screams and starts forward
dory pulls her back
louis is getting up groggily
hs nose is pouring blood
how do you like that you son of a bitch
i should have done it sooner
irwin punches him in the stomach
louis oofs and doubles over
among them we see steve masterton and marcy charlton
steve getting up hey
louis is slowly straightening up
irwin is in a sour frenzy of glee
how do you like that
how do louis pushes the old man with both hands
he goes stumbling and flailing backwards
strikes the coffin
knocks it off its bier
a scream goes up from the mourners
her mother struggles to hold her but rachel easily breaks free and goes running down the aisle
steve gets up and goes toward hes picking himself out of a tangled mess of coffin and overturned floral tributes
his suit is wet from spilled water
louis has just reached him and that stunned look is gone
i think he intends to do the cool jerk all over irwin goldmans puny little body
irwin strikes a gentleman jim corbett pugilistic pose
im ready for ya
ill take yapart
as louis wades in steve masterton gets between them
at the last possible moment
steve manages to block the punch with his body
jesus whats wrong with you louis
its your sons funeral not a boxing match
that gets to louis
he drops his fists
that stunned expression creeps over his face again that look that says he doesnt have the slightest clue as to whats going on or how it could possibly have happened
pascow voice the soil of a mans heart is stonier doc louis turns toward pascow bloody and ruined in his jogging shorts and muscle shirt has the pew to himself
except for church who is sitting on his lap and purring
a man grows what he can
and tends it
a sense of horrible awareness comes into his face
and then he covers it with his hands and begins to sob
the trucker is singing along with the radio
its closer to the floorboards than ever
we are at some distance far enough to see that the two of them have moved quite close to the road
we can see their faces upturned to us we can hear the amplified rattling sound of the kite itself
the camera pans to the left to the road
and we can see the truck fairly close by now and coming closer
juds lighting a cigarette
his walkman phones are around his neck
i want to fly it
can i fly it now mommy
in a minute hon
let gage finish his turn
this is the last moment of happiness in this mans life so lets make it very happy
as he and gage stare up at the kite irwin voice jesus
im sorry the fight has gone out of irwin and steve has backed away but cautiously
hes ready to jump back in if one or the other goes mad again
but irwin is shuffling toward louis hands out everyone else has gathered in a knot near the front of the chapel
among them is rachel and her mother weeping in each others arms
i dont know what happened to me
louis please louis brushes by him with no acknowledgement that irwin even exists
he kneels down slowly by the coffin and puts his head against it
louis weeping im sorry gage im so sorry little hero
theres a strong gust of wind
the ball of string falls out of gages hand
it got away from him
that numb shit
rachel outraged ellen creed
it is bouncing and unraveling
more importantly it is being carried directly toward the highway
he takes off after the ball of twine
kite fline too fast
sound the oncoming truck
slamming toward us a brutal leviathan on eighteen wheels
hes looking looking toward his people at the picnic table
louis shrugs good humored what can you d alarm hits juds face
dont let him go in the road louis
rachel looks registers terrible alarm
rachel screams get him louis
hes still scampering after the bouncing ball of kite twine which has now almost reached the road
the sound is loud enough so hes having trouble hearing
louis cups his ear what
rachel shrieks jud is running toward the road although hell never get to gage in time only louis has a chance
horrible understanding dawns on his face
he whips around and sees the kids almost in the road the ball of twine is in it
gage cheerful geddit geddit geddit
gage reaches the middle of the road as the truck comes around the corner
louis is running across the field getting close to the side of the road
rachel is clutching ellie by the picnic table
jud is helplessly trying to wave the truck down as it passes him
as he reaches the broken white line he grabs the ball of string
gage turns his head
gage not afraid druck
suddenly the drivers face turns into a halloween mask of horror
he blasts the air horn
louis shrieks blare of the air horn
a shadow falls over his face
there is an audible click
and we freeze frame
what we have now is a tremen dously winning photograph of a little boy not quite two with a ball of string in his hand
and a shadow lying across his face
louis is pushing rachel out of a hospital door
rachel is in a wheelchair and looks radiantly happy so for that matter does louis
i think we may safely assume that the small blanketed bundle in rachels arms is gage
louis bare to the waist is tubbing a two month old gage in a baby tub
the infant looks confused but calm
the whole family by the christmas tree following an orgy of present opening
ellie about five has a doll in each hand
louis and rachel are in pajamas
gage about five months is lying in a drift of wrapping paper
he looks confused but calm
a childs sneaker lying in the road
its splashed with blood
gage hes about nine months old in this snap is propped up in the angle of a sofa
theres a big white rabbit in his lap
gage looks c
ellie and gage bundled up against the chicago winter
ellie is pulling a childs chair sled
gage is propped up in the chair
hes about eleven months old in this snap
the orinco tanker overturned on the far side of route
this one was taken at gages first birthday party
hes wearing a party hat and looking at a birthday cake with a single candle on it while louis kisses one cheek and rachel kisses the other
louis in the road
hes holding gages jumper which is torn blood soaked and inside out
louis is looking up toward the sky and screaming
here is a full face studio portrait of gage
he is smiling at us heartbreakingly lovely
camera holds on this while jud voice sedative finally took hold
hes holding the studio portrait in his hands and looking at it fixedly
the other photos the good ones that is not the screamers those we may assume exist only in louiss tortured memory are scattered on the table
we only saw a few there are actually hundreds
louis puts the photo down as jud comes in and crosses to the fridge
louiss nose is badly swelled
he also has a black eye
jud gets a couple of beers and comes back toward the table
your father in law packs a wallop for an old guy
he and his wife gone back to chicago
squatting out there at the holiday inn like a couple of vultures
he really thinks rachels going to go back with them
her and ellie
louis the swing door opens
they look toward she looks dazed and shocked
there are brown circles under her eyes but otherwise her complexion is much too white
shes wearing fuzzy pjs
shes carrying the picture of her pulling gage on the sled
ellie coming to the table i want to go back to my own room
i cant sleep with mommy
she keeps stealing the covers
what you got there ellie
at first she doesnt want to show him but jud is very kind
jud studying it why thats real nice
you pullin him on a sled
bet he liked that didnt he
she is starting to cry
jud is also leaking at the eyes
ellie crying i used to pull im a lot
louis looking down at his hands nods
im going to carry this picture mr
crandall until god lets gage come back
jud reacts violently
and louis looks up dully curious
but hasnt the thought already passed through louiss mind
yes i think it has
god doesnt do things like that
i know you loved ybrother but he can if he wants to
he can do anything just like inspector gadget on tv
but i have to keep things ready for him thats what i think
ive got his picture and im going to sit in his chair ellie and im going to eat his breakfast cereal too even though it tastes like boogers
she bursts into tears
louis take care of your little girl
she needs you
his face is stricken
louis comes in with ellie in his arms
he puts her gently into her bed and pulls the covers up
shes already mostly asleep
louis kisses her good night ellie
he starts for the door
god could take it back if he wanted to couldnt he
if he really really wanted to
can i have faith in that
he stands looking at her for a long time apparently thinking about this quite deeply
yes i suppose you can
good night ellie
he steps out closing the door
in some sense comforted it may be a poison comfort but she surely doesnt know this she turns over on her side to go to sleep
we can see the picture of gage under her arm
the light here is fairly dim
louis goes down and opens another door
he pokes his head in
he reacts first with surprise then a species of horrified disgust
church is crouched on rachels sleeping form
louis comes in and swats the cat a damned good one
louis low snarl fuck off hairball
it hisses at him through a mouthful of fangs its eyes big green balls
and then it flees
camera follows it out the door
rachel stirs and mutters thickly then lies still again
shes doped to the gills
louis bends over and kisses her gently
he leaves the room and closes the door behind him
he tries the door a couple of times to make sure its firmly on the latch his face wears an expression of howd he get in there in the first
then he walks down the hall to the stairs
the cat is on one of the risers
louis trips over it
for a moment hes pinwheeling madly for balance on the verge of falling
he regains his balance as the cat goes shooting across the dining room toward the kitchen
louis regains his equilibrium after a bit and continues on down
as louis enters through the swing door from the dining room jud is just letting church out the back door
as jud closes the door louis slightly antagonistic i thought youd be gone by now
i got you a fresh beer out of the fridge louis
he indicates the table where there is indeed a fresh beer
jud i buried my son today and im very tired
i wonder if we could just youre thinking of things best not thought of louis
im thinking about going to bed
but he begins pouring the beer into a glass
you never asked me if anyone had buried a person up there in the micmac burying ground louiss hand jerks
beer goes foaming across the kitchen table
but i think the thought has crossed your mind
look at this mess
ayuh its a mess all right
as louis goes to get a cloth to wipe up the mess i know the micmacs thought it was a holy place
and then they thought it was a cursed place
thats why they moved on
because something called a wendigo soured the ground
and because the dead walked
louis stops sopping and looks at him
its been done
what youve been thinking of has been done
the time is the late summer of although i dont believe we need to know that specifically
the sign on the station reads ludlow
there are a few s cars parked near the station they have gas ration coupons on the windshields
and a hearse
a train is coming
we can see the undertaker is trying to talk to bill baterman a man in his forties who periodically wipes his brow with a bandana
bill walks away
he doesnt want to talk he doesnt want comfort
hes a grief stricken bitter man
jud voice over timmy baterman was on his way home from the war with his purple heart when he got killed in some stupid car accident down in georgia
the door of the mail car is open
the undertaker and three trainmen are unloading timmy batermans coffin which is draped in a star flag
bill baterman stands by watching balefully as they carry his sons final apartment to the back of the hearse and load it in
jud v o continues bill was bitter his son had been in the thick of it two years and then got shot in the leg a clean flesh wound
he was supposed to be coming home safe and sound
instead he come home in a box after all
the doors close
the hearse pulls away
the camera pans to bill baterman who stands staring balefully after it and mopping his brow
jud v o continues he wasnt able to get to the bottom of the truth louis
louis is now sitting down drinking a beer staring at jud
ill bite whats the bottom of the truth jud
that sometimes dead is better
sometimes dead is better
louis bitter tell that to my wife and little girl
it aint your wife and little girl thats got me worried louis
were featuring a fresh grave
that of timmy baterman
a truck showing only parking lights turns into the graveyard and drives slowly up to it
it stops and bill baterman gets out
he looks at the grave and then goes to the back of his truck
jud voice over timmy was buried on july nd as i remember
he reaches in
and brings out a pick and shovel
shes a middle aged woman dressed in mid forties style
shes got a rug beater in one hand the other is up to her eyes to shade the sun
shes staring at something horrified
jud v o continues it was four or five days later when
a young man dressed in jeans and a plaid shirt is shambling up the road
his eyes are vacant
his shirt is half untucked
his hair is sticking up in a wild crows nest thatch
there is an ugly mess of healed scars on his neck and one side of his face
i think one of his ears may be gone torn off in the accident
jud v o continues margie washburn seen him walking up the road toward yorkies livery
shes screaming we hear her faintly
he turns toward her and we see a green light like the st
elmos fire in the little god swamp glow dimly deep in his eyes
he grins at margie
she hesitates for a moment or two and then walks up toward the door
lots of people saw timmy baterman walking back and forth between the home place and the town line
but it was margie
shes in a hallway in front of a door with ludlow selectmen printed on the frosted glass
after a moment she opens it and goes in
continues who finally got up enough guts to talk to the town fathers about it
she knew it had to be stopped louis
margie and four men are grouped around a desk
shes talking theyre listening
the camera lazily pans the four men one of course is jud as a young man
continues she knew it was an abomination
george anderson the town postmaster was there
and alan purinton
i was there
its a ramshackle old farm which looks remarkably like the estate of that gentleman farmer jordy verrill
an old ford pulls into the driveway and the four men get out
sound bleeds in most of all the sound of the crickets
they go to the door and jud is wordlessly elected as the prime honcho
sound crazy laughter
bill baterman voice stop that timmy
the four men look at each other
they start around to the back
timmy baterman is staring directly into the setting sun his eyes glowing with green fire
hes laughing like goofy gone insane
bill scared is trying to make him stop to turn away from the sun
the four men come around the side of the house
they freeze when they see bill and timmy
oh holy jesus lookit that
bill whirls around and sees them
you men get out of here
i heard your boy was killed down georgia
bill agitated that was a mistake
you see him standing there dont you
now get out
get the christ off my land
now timmy turns around and comes shambling forward
timmy laughing ge ow
ge cwise off eye an
george revolted oh jesus jud
i can smell him
he aint dead
give him a day or two and hell be fine
dont you say that
bill this aint right you can see that yourself bill screaming timmy laughing dead
we love dead
abruptly he reaches up with both hands and scratches down his cheeks goring deep grooves in his flesh
blood flows sluggishly out
very weird blood
bill grabs timmy whos still laughing wildly and gets him turned around
timmy shambles back to where he was originally standing
bill goes with him like a man who has charge over a trained baboon
a stupid trained baboon
bill over his shoulder you want to get out of here before i get my shotgun
you boys are trespassing
god help you bill
bill snarls god never helped me
i helped myself
staring directly into the setting sun and laughing wildly mindlessly
a car pulls up with its lights off and stops
there was a fire
we see legs as people get out of the car and hands holding tin cans of gasoline
hands splash gasoline from the cans along the sides of the house
jud as a young man rings the bell an old fashioned twist type
bill voice whos there
timmy laughing screeching voice ooo air
get out billy the place is going up
he walks away
bill baterman wearing a strappy tee shirt looks out the window
i seen you
i seen you jud crandall
a match is struck
and applied to wet boards
the other side of the house the same
in the back yard jud lights a torch and heaves it through the kitchen windows
the men draw away toward the front their faces grim and judgmental
going up fast
you think bills gonna get out jud
jud stony if he dont he dont
it bursts open
we see two men struggling at the forefront of an inferno correction one man and an undead monster
timmy is giggling and screaming trying to pull his father back into the flames
bill struggling no
let me go
timme laughing love dead
he sinks his teeth into his fathers arm
a beam falls on timmy lighting him afire
bill breaks free and runs down the porch steps
hes burning and laughing
and into the fire he goes still shrieking and laughing
bill baterman is collapsed on the lawn as sparks drift down around him his face hidden against his thighs weeping
camera moves slowly in on the four men who are grouped at the end of the driveway by the road and staring with awe at jud softly sometimes dead is
and on it a sixth title card the dead walk
a jet plane rises into the sky from behind the building
this is the final call for uniteds flight to chicago
in the b
we can see irwin and dory goldman waiting by the jetway with ellie as the last few passengers board
rachel looks confused and grief stricken
she also looks punchy doped up
i imagine shes floating on a sea of valium and that makes her easier to deal with
louiss battle scars are fading a little
the gate agent is standing by the jetway with a mike in one hand and a bunch of boarding passes in the other
gate agent concludes all passengers should now be aboard
you better get going hon
oh louis i just dont know about this i told you last night this can be the start of patching things up with your folks
if something good doesnt come of gages death i think ill go crazy
louis are you sure
i dont want to go to chicago gramma dory
why not darling
i had a bad dream last night
irwin kindly about what
pause and gage
dory and irwin exchange a knowing sad glance over the childs head
and someone named paxcow
louis guides her to the jetway
come on you guys before you miss the boat
he kisses dory
irwin hugs him
louis i am sorry
what can i say
that i lost my mind
its the truth but no good excuse
louis hugs him back we all lost our minds irwin
louis kisses rachel
then he kneels and hugs ellie
be good to your mother darlin
she needs you
come with us daddy
please come with us
ill be there in three days four at the most
ive got to get the electricity shut off and square things with your school so the truant officer aint after you and ellie crying please daddy
ellie crying harder i dont know
louis great emphasis everythings going to be all right ellie
now go on get aboard
do you swear
the voice of authority has spoken
we can tell by ellies face that while things are still not all right they are a little better
she joins her mother
the four of them rachel ellie and the goldmans start down the jetway
ellie looks back once as if begging him to come
and then theyre gone
louiss face changes
now it is a stony and contemplative face
not when you get right down to it a very nice face
he turns and strides away
the family station wagon is in the f
we hear the sound of jet engines and as louis reaches the wagon he turns and watches from behind it a united airlines jet lifts into view and banks away
face set he gets into the wagon and drives away
the creedmobile pulls up across from the brewer tru value hardware and louis crosses to it
on it a six cell flashlight duracell d batteries a pick a shovel and a nylon drop sheet in cellophane packaging
now the clerks hands come into the frame and drop a pair of heavy work gloves into the pile
anything else for you today
louis after a look i think we got it all
the clerk starts to ring things up
looks like heavy work
it could be
the quality of louiss reply is somehow unnatural
the clerk looks at him momentarily unsure and uncertain
then he starts ringing things up again
ellie is in the window seat asleep
rachel is holding a paperback but not reading it
her eyes are red
shes looking into space
camera drifts to ellie
her sleep is not easy
her head turns from side to side as if in negation
she becomes steadily more upset
shes starting to mutter
suddenly her eyes flare open and she screams
we can see the goldmans in the seats behind the creeds
they are startled
so are other passengers
a stewardess comes running
paxcow says its almost too late
paxcow says its almost too late
we have to go back
paxcow says its almost too late
the creed wagon turns in and drives up one of the lanes
it stops and louis gets out
he walks to a fresh grave on which the first flowers are already starting to wilt
he sits down and takes a flower
he plucks it looking at the grave steadily
he says nothing for a long time
pause what happened to you is wrong
he runs toward the camera happy and laughing in slow motion
louis is now weeping but he seems calm just the same
pascow voice remember doc
louis looks at pascow bloody and mutilated is standing by it
the barrier was not meant to be crossed
the ground is sour
he is not put out of countenance in the slightest by pascows appearance he probably knows pascow is just a figment of his conscience or imagination and so do we
ill tell you where the ground is sour the ground in my heart is sour
let me tell you something else vic baby wrong is wrong
that was wrong
dont talk like an asshole even if you are just a bit of underdone potato or a blot of mustard
he stands mute just looking
louis weeping he was my son
he wasnt even two and he was run down in the fucking road and he was almost in pieces and if you dont think im going to try
vic has put on his boogie shoes
hes crying harder
abruptly he reaches out at the floral tributes and knocks a bunch of them over
if it doesnt work if he comes back like timmy baterman ill put him to sleep
but im going to try
pause and if it doesnt work
they dont ever need to know
the camera moves leisurely along this hallway which is lined with pictures of rachel ellie
and gage there may even be a couple in which louis is featured but damned few
near the end of the hall a door is open and light spills out
rachel voice honey you just had a bad dream
you know that dont you
ellie voice it wasnt a dream
it was paxcow
the camera goes through the door and into the room where ellie is staying
shes in bed still badly upset
rachel is sitting on the bed beside her
theres a single lamp on the bedside table
paxcow says daddys going to do something really bad
he who is this paxcow
is he like the boogeyman
hes a ghost
but hes a good ghost
rachel turns off the bed lamp
there are no ghosts ellie
i want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense
will you at least call and make sure daddys okay
of course i will
she kisses ellie
now will you try to go to sleep
ellie turns over on her side yes mom
rachel gets up and leaves the room
pascow is here halfway down the hall to the stairs bloody as ever
rachel doesnt see him
she looks perplexed a woman trying to think of something
she stops very near him
rachel to herself paxcow why do i know that name
rachel suddenly straightens
she looks startled and afraid
was she saying pascow
she suddenly heads for the stairs fast
sound a car starting up
the station wagon backs out and heads down the driveway
as it passes the camera we see louis driving
the wagon turns onto route and heads off
camera holds on the house
a beat of silence
then the telephone starts ringing
irwin and dory are watching rachel with some anxiety
rachel is holding the phone to her ear
we can hear the filtered sound of one ring after another
she hangs up
hes not home
why he probably went out for a hamburger or a chicken dinner dear
you know how men are when theyre alone
good old irwins face says that maybe louis went out for a couple of grams of coke and a whore in nazi ss boots
rachel is dialing another number
sound phone starts to ring
he shuffles to the telephone
his walkman phones are around his neck
hes got a bottle of beer in one hand
jud picks up hello you got judson
its rachel creed jud

jud surprised voice chicago

jud voice i dont was it pascow

jud alarmed voice rachel

she hangs up

the buzz of an open line
jud slowly replaces the receiver
the man looks very grim
rachel comes down the stairs dressed for travelling
shes carrying a suitcase in one hand
her parents meet her at the foot of the stairs
a nights sleep
i have to go
the connections are tight and i have to be at ohare in forty minutes
will you drive me daddy
you know somethings wrong dont you
and ellie does too
ill drive you
ellie voice mommy
they all turn to please hurry
come and kiss me
ellie races into her arms
sound of a car engine throbbing and low
it cuts off
camera moves in on the low stone wall between the cemetery and the road
beyond it we can see the roof of the creed station wagon
louis appears dressed in dark clothes
he looks both ways then tosses a big duffle bag over the wall
stuff clanks inside
louis climbs over the wall grabs his bag and checks out the scene
a quiet city of the dead
sound of crickets ree ree ree
he heads for gages grave
ill come with you if you want honey
rachel shakes her head ive got three planes to catch and i got the last seats on two of them
its like god saved them for me
irwins car heads for it
louis approaches it slowly and sets down his bag of grave robbing equipment
he sets aside the remaining floral tributes and then opens the bag and takes out the spade
he looks down at the grave for a long second
louis low gonna bust you out son
he starts to shovel
already the shape of the excavation is beginning to show
the work is easy this earth is new and fresh
everyone looks impatient but rachel looks half crazy
pilot voice this is the captain speaking
im sorry about this delay folks but weve got a real low ceiling tonight and air traffic controls playing it safe
looks like its going to be about half an hour before we get on a roll so im turning off the no smoking sign
theres a general groan
camera moves in on rachel who has closed her eyes
i think shes praying
now its pretty deep
four feet maybe
louis is standing in it
we see his feet as the shovel goes up and down up and down
hes sweating and dirt streaked
hes tossing dirt on a big pile
suddenly as he takes another shovelful we hear a scraping sound
he tosses the shovel aside and squats
theres a white streak on the bottom of the grave the top of gages coffin
louis swipes his hand through the loose dirt uncovering more and then he begins to sweep off the top of the coffin with his hands
jud comes out
hes wearing a light jacket
his walkman phones are around his neck
hes got a six pack
he looks at its dark
he sits down
you done it you stupid old man
now you got to undo it
he puts his earphones on
cracks a beer
lights a cigarette
pushes the play button on the deck
faint sounds of the clash buzz sawing rock the casbah
jud begins to watch
he climbs out of the grave and opens his duffle bag
he starts to pull out the pick
sound of an approaching car
a police car comes cruising slowly along
the spotlight on the drivers side comes on and runs along the graveyards stone wall
it reaches the end of the wall
everything looks jake
the spotlight goes out and the police car speeds up
he relaxes perceptibly
he gets the pick and drops back into the grave
louis inserts the tip of the pick in the flange of the coffin and levers it
and the lock breaks
the coffin lid comes up a little dirt gritting in the hinges
heres a man on the thinnest edge between sanity and madness
think youll make your connection in boston
i have to
hes lying on his stomach reaching in
we hear the sound of dirt grating in hinges again
were looking up into his face
if gage had a pov this would be it
louiss face fills with a terrible grief
oh gage oh honey
his chin slips to his chest even though we hear creedence on his phones and to him the sound must be at blastoff levels
theres a long round ash on his cigarette in the tray
a couple of empty beer cans on the table beside him
a truck blasts by startling him out of his doze
he jerks his head up suddenly
and slaps himself
he is sitting on the edge of the grave holding his dead son in his arms rocking him
gage is back to us
we see only a small limp figure in a dark suit
hair flops limply
its going to be all right
i swear its going to be all right
the canvas tarp has been spread open to the right
louis begins to lay his son down on it
its littered with flower petals
one limp hand appears among them
he closes the tarp over gage making a roll
he then produces rope from the duffle bag
he cuts the rope and begins to tie one piece around one end of the canvas roll containing the corpse of his son
pilot voice good evening again ladies and gentlemen
her seatmate is knitting something
across the aisle sits victor pascow bloody but serene hands clasped in his lap looking straight ahead
rachel looks around tensely
pilot continues im delighted to tell you that weve got a strong tail wind tonight and we expect to arrive at bostons logan airport almost on time
pascow clenches his fist in a thats one for our side
rachel softly thank god
her seatmate looks at her a bit strangely
hes got the bundle containing his son and the duffle bag with the tools
he runs bent over
he reaches the wall and theres the sound of another motor
he crouches at the base of the wall
here comes that same police car
the spotlight runs along the wall
crouching against his side of the wall and sweating
the cop gets out
he walks slowly toward the wall
now we see the cop looking over the top
if he looks down
but he doesnt
instead he turns around so we see his back
louis looks up miserably scared pouring sweat
then sound of the cop taking a whiz
sound of his fly being zipped
he looks back at the cemetery for a moment
i aint afraid of no ghost
he walks back to his cruiser gets in and hauls ass
he collapses with relief
then he gets up and looks cautiously over the wall
nothing there but his car parked a little way down on the other side of the road
he tosses the duffle bag over the top of the wall
he puts the canvas roll containing gage on top of the wall
then he vaults over
he takes the roll gets the duffle bag hooked over his shoulder by the string and runs across the road like a soldier crossing enemy territory
he goes to the rear of the wagon
he puts the body down
he feels in his pocket for his keys
he looks around feeling exposed
the other pocket
still no keys
he begins to hunt feverishly through his pockets
maybe in his jacket
sound an approaching car
a civilian not the ubiquitous cop
he turns his pockets out spilling change everywhere
suddenly a little light goes on in his eyes
he goes to the drivers side of the car and looks in at the keys are in the switch
he snatches the keys and returns to the back of the wagon
he uses the key to open the doorgate
he puts gages body in gently then the duffle bag
he closes the doorgate and returns to the front of the car
he opens the drivers door and freezes
louis returns to the rear gets his keys from the doorgate comes back to the front gets in and drives away
people are debarking into the gate area
through them comes rachel running fast pushing some people excusing herself incoherently
pascow is walking near her
theres just time
if you run
without looking at pascow rachel takes off her shoes and runs
shes sprinting down the concourse look out joanie benoit
the female gate agent is starting to close the jetway door
dont do that babe
the gate agent looks puzzled as if she just had a thought or maybe a gas pain
she stops closing the door
rachel runs into the area
she sees it is just starting to swing ponderously away from the jetway
make it come back
i cant rachel bolts down the jetway
the gate agent stares after her and then runs for her stand where we can see flight and bangor on the slide cards
she picks up her mike
rachel stands all alone at the end of it
rachel screams it starts to swing back to pick her up
pascow appears behind her and puts a hand on her shoulder
youre doing just fine
hes fast asleep with the tinny sound of graham parker coming out of his walkman phones
sound an approaching car
the station wagon turns in and parks
louis gets out
he opens the back removes the body in the tarp and the duffle bag filled with tools
he manages to get everything together and walks to the edge of the path
he looks at off it goes glimmering in the dark
he holds the corpse of his little boy to him
please god let this work
he sets off
he missed the whole thing
nice going jud
louis passes under like a ghost
louis is crying
he crosses to the deadfall
aint gonna stop gage
aint gonna look down
he begins to mount the deadfall
he reaches the top
and woven into the deadfall behind him facing the pet sematary is that snarling face
louis descends the other side
louis reaches the bottom and looks at the path winds onward through those gigantic trees it glows slightly
that phosphorescent glow is a lot more pronounced
sounds of crickets and frogs
the water is mucky and still
hummocks stick up like knobs on the back of a creature best not seen
fog drifts through the dead trees
louis doesnt want to go in there
i wouldnt either
but he does
pascow is lounging back against the rack of folders and getting some of them bloody
its been very busy tonight
i really dont have anything
what about the aries k with the scratch on the side
the clerk starts looking through her papers
i do have an aries k but it came in sort of beat up theres a long scrape up one side ill take it
he comes walking toward the camera with gage in his arms and the duffle bag over his shoulder
mist swirls around him
the landscape is weird surreal
cricket sounds amplified
in fact there are a lot of swampy marshy sounds too many
it sounds almost prehistoric
he looks slowly around at a demonic face takes shape in the mist and floats slowly toward the camera
it runs out a tongue thats about nine feet long
its eyes blow out
blood and thick gooey stuff runs from the sockets
he closes his eyes
after a moment he opens them
just we can barely see them because they are thick in mist but he is standing on a couple of low marshy tussocks
suddenly a thick tentacle slimes its way out of the standing water and slithers around his ankle
he turns around and begins to walk again
the tentacle falls away
myriad sounds none of them pleasant laughter gobbling howls screams
sounds like the swamp has been invaded by a pack of escaped lunatics
louis continues on regardless
louis comes into the frame
hes obviously tiring now but he keeps moving along
sound approaching footsteps
something is coming which sounds approximately the size of a tyrannosaurus rex
and it just keeps getting louder and louder and louder
louis looks plenty scared
sound a falling tree
those sounds keep getting closer and closer
another tree falls we see this one
and now we see a shape just a shape
hes scared almost to death
his face turns up
it is vaguely manlike perhaps sixty feet tall perhaps eighty
we dont see it very well nor do we have to im not even sure its flesh and blood
but there is a clear suggestion of a head
now it turns and looks down
looks at louis creed
we see great yellow eyes the size of lighthouse lamps
it makes a huge grunting sound
and then walks on
the sound of footfalls is slowly diminishing
it was the wendigo
dear god i think the wendigo just passed within sixty feet of me
slowly he begins to walk again
in the extreme f
is a tree which has just fallen it is no small tree either but a great big old fir
louis approaches it
looks at the tree
looks down at here is a gigantic animal track if it was full of water louis could swim in it
it looks like no animal track weve ever seen before
three big claws at the end of it
looks up again
his face is set and hard
it doesnt matter
come on gage
he starts to walk again
sound the wind lonesome and keening
the camera moves slowly toward the slope dreaming its way over those rocky cairns
most of them burst apart
sound tortured breathing
louis toils his way into view carrying his bundle
he reaches the top
he makes his way slowly into the burying ground
he stumbles over a rock
slowly gathers his things together and gets up again
he goes a little further and then stops and looks at we can also see the shredded remains of a green garbage bag
he slowly kneels down
he puts the canvas tarp to one side and slowly takes the pick and shovel from the duffle bag
by now he is clearly a man approaching total exhaustion
it tracks past the camera
both of them look tense
rachel is bolt upright behind the wheel
as one of the tires blow
it goes skidding and slueing across the road the rear tire half off the rim
it climbs the curb and hits a tree
she lurches forward but shes wearing her seat belt good girl
she unbuckles it and gets out
she looks at the car which now has quite a bit more wrong with it than just a scratch up the side
rachel slumps near tears
louis isnt the only one whos been through a lot tonight
pascow comes from around the tree as rachel walks to the road looking for cars or something
he looks urgent and upset
its trying to stop you
do you hear me
its trying to stop you
rachel looks around uncertainly
a little afraid
as she scans the scene she looks at and through pascow
is anyone there
after a moment of silence she turns back to the road
lights appear and brighten as a car approaches
rachel steps to the shoulder and after a moment she sticks out her thumb surely for the first time in her life
the car sweeps by her without slowing
louiss hands enter the shot and put a few more rocks on it
the camera pulls back and we see him surveying his work
beside him is the canvas tarp now open and empty
absently louis stuffs the tarp into the duffle bag where his tools have also been replaced and stands up with a wince
one hand goes to his lower back
he looks down at the cairn
come back to me gage
come back to us
he turns away toward the stairs
shes walking down the shoulder with her high heels in one hand
an approaching car
she turns thumb out
the car blasts by
rachel shouts she starts walking again
louis is moving down the path
as he passes the tire swing he pushes it setting it in motion
louis slings the duffle bag wearily to one side and goes into the kitchen
church is under the table but louis doesnt see him
sound of louis slowly plodding up the stairs
he comes into view dirty and exhausted his hair hanging in his face
he walks down the hall toward the master bedroom
the clock on the bedtable reads a
louis falls face first on the immaculate bedspread and lies still
in this shot we should note the closet door is standing open
the camera moves in slowly
nothing for a beat
then a small white hand slams up through the rocks hopefully scaring the living shit out of us
camera moves closer as the hand begins to feel around
it takes one of the rocks and pushes it aside
the sounds are not encouraging
it is grunting and growling
there is nothing human here
rocks begin to tumble as gage starts to come out of his grave
fast asleep on the coverlet in his dirty jeans and black sweater
my babe is still takin a hike
but here comes another vehicle
the camera moves in on that snarling face
sounds gage coming
dead dry breath
low snarling noises
now we see small feet in dirty black shoes walking down the deadfall
suddenly as the lights appear she does a claudette colbert pulling her skirt up and exhibiting a very lovely leg
lights its an orinco truck naturally spotlight her
the truck stops
the driver leans over and opens the door
hop in baby
hes under the kitchen table green eyes gleaming
i think he loves dead hates living
sound the doorlatch
gages shoes grit slowly across the linoleum leaving dirty tracks
church turns to watch gages passage and then follows
camera holds on louis as those gritting footsteps approach
then we pan to the closet
on the floor is louiss little black bag
we hold on this as the footfalls near
a small white hand enters the frame and pulls the doctor bag out of the closet
now another hand enters the frame and opens the bag
the hands search around inside and bring out a scalpel
they hold it up
the gage thing makes a contented sound
it sweeps past the camera cant you go any faster
lady i got nine points on my license right now
its just that she looks at him pleading
the trucker speeds up
if you only understood how important this is thats all right babe
only if we get stopped next time ill be the one hitchin and you can give me a ride
more deeply asleep than ever
suddenly from inside comes the sound of quiet riot singing screaming bang your head
its the stereo and boy is it cranked
jud straightens up so suddenly he almost falls off his chair
his hands go first to his earphones his first thought on waking is that its coming from there and then he hurries inside
camera pans down to small muddy tracks on the porch floor
he hurries in turns on the light and rushes across to his stereo system which is state of the art digital it looks like a flying saucer among the more
traditional furnishings of the room
he shuts it off and looks around frowning
sound todd rundgren singing bang on the drum all day at the top of his voice
juds head snaps toward the sound
the camera pulls back as jud hurries across the kitchen to the counter where the radio is
he turns it off looking around more bewildered than ever
jud sharply whos here
he walks toward the door which gives on the hall
its dimly lit by light spill from the living room and kitchen
come on stop playing games
sound molly hatchet flirtin with disaster being played top end from upstairs
jud hurries up
let me suggest that there is a certain psychology at work here for the moment hes more concerned about waking the neighborhood with all this high decible rock and roll
than with the prowler
and he would certainly know who or what that prowler was if he had time to think
he enters and turns on the light
we see a portable phonograph with the record turning
jud rushes over and turns it off
he looks around and we see by his face that he knows
pause are you the one playing games
he goes to the window and looks out at he turns slowly and walks toward the bed
come on out
he reaches in his pocket and brings out a pocket knife
he unfolds the blade
i want to show you something
jud to the cat how did you
a small hand holding a scalpel shoots out from beneath the skirt of the coverlet and slashes juds calf he screams with pain and staggers backward
the other hand shoots out
gage grabs one of juds ankles and pulls
with a startled yell he falls
this ones gotta be pretty rough
george will know what to do
we finally see gage but it should be clear to us that its not really gage at all
some daemonic presence is riding inside the mouldering disfigured shell of gage
there is a struggle
jud is repeatedly slashed with the scalpel
perhaps he gets gage a time or two with the pocketknife
gage screams and gibbers nothing intelligible here only sounds
gage sits on top of him
and then bites into his throat
rachels truck has arrived
it pulls up
rachel opens the passenger door which is on juds side
we can see pascow sitting in the passenger seat where rachel just was
thank you so much
i didnt get a ticket so youre welcome lady
and more seriously whatever your problems are i hope they work out
its the end of the line for me too im not allowed any further
rachel to the trucker im sure things will be fine
she closes the door and steps down
the truck starts off with a hiss of released airbrakes
as it pulls past her rachel starts across the road when gage soft voice mummy
she stops startled
her face wears a did i hear that
she looks back toward juds house
gage soft voice mummy
rachel walks halfway up juds paved walk and looks at the one place in the whole world we do not want rachel to go
up the steps to the porch
all through this shes been travelling with two bags her handbag and a light tote with her initials on it
now she sets the tote down on the top step and opens the porch door
she looks very uncertain
this is the wee hours of the morning and someone elses house
gage voice mummy i need you
rachel looks stunned rocked
she steps onto the porch
who the door to the house swings open
after a moment church comes into the doorway and sits down
gage voice mummy i need you
she crosses to the open door
rachel steps in
hes restless having a very bad dream from the look
he rolls back and forth
closer and closer to the edge
finally with a wild yell he goes over onto the floor
he comes awake
hes aches from top to bottom and side to side
but his back is worst
his hands go to it
he starts to get up very slowly and this his eyes fix on they enter the house go to the closet then leave again
he scrambles for the closet his aches and pains forgotten
he stares in wildly
he pulls the doctor bag out
his original hope is now tempered with the first signs of fear
he begins to go through the doctor bag
suddenly he brings out a case and opens it
the case is empty but the indented shape is clear
there was a scalpel in this case
but not anymore
oh my god
louis stands there tensely listening for a moment or two but theres only silence
he rushes down the hallway and opens the door to gages room
he goes downstairs yelling gages name
the phone rings
louis almost jumps out of his skin reaching for it
irwin voice hello louis its irwin
i just wanted to be sure rachel got back all right
as irwin says this louiss eyes fix upon something
one set comes in from the shed garage and heads for the parlor and upstairs
the other comes out of the parlor and crosses to the kitchen door giving directly on the outside
in his eyes we suddenly see that he understands everything
or almost everything
irwin voice louis
are you there
louis slowly yes im here
irwin voice did she get there all right
yes shes fine
irwin voice well put her on at that end and ill put ellie on at this one
ellies very worried about her mother
pause shes almost in hysterics
irwin an edge in his voice now then i suggest you wake her up
i think she had a dream that her mother was dead
ill call you right back
irwin voice louis
but louis whose last few responses have been almost trancelike hangs up
he looks at the tracks then goes into the parlor
tiny bloody hands lift it off the cradle
a tiny bloody finger dials
the phone starts to ring
after two or three ringy dingys louis looking extremely upset comes out of the parlor and picks it up
irwin youll just have to gage voice im at juds daddy
will you come over and play with me
louis is dumbfounded
slack mouthed with terror
louis a bare whisper gage
gage voice mommy already came
we played daddy
first i played with jud and then mommy came and i played with mommy
we had an awful good time
now i want to play with you
gage begins to giggle
a really awful sound
what did you do
what did you click
the gage thing hangs up still giggling
he puts the doctor bag down on the bed and roots through it
he comes up with three syringes still wrapped in paper and puts them aside
then he roots around some more and comes up with several ampoules
he holds one up for inspection and we can read the word morphine on it very clearly
he carries the syringes and ampoules of morphine over to the window
his hair has gone partially white
he fills all three syringes with morphine using two ampoules for each syringe i
enough to kill a polar bear and puts them in the left breast pocket of his shirt
he puts the spare ampoules in the right breast pocket of his shirt
louis is slowly going insane
what remains of his rationality is like a rapidly fraying rope
what you buy is what you own and sooner or later what you own comes home to you
wasnt that what you said jud
wasnt that pretty much it
he leaves the room
louis comes out the door
in one hand hes got a raw pork chop
in the other he is carrying a pair of playtex rubber gloves
he walks to the soft shoulder and waits for an orinco truck to pass
then he crosses
he walks most of the way to the house then stops
he gets up humping his back warily
want some grub
he tosses the pork chop onto the grass
he hurries down the steps goes to the chop sniffs it and starts to chow up
he looks up at he is pulling on the rubber gloves
dont mind me
eat it while you can
eat all you want
he starts worrying the chop again
smack smack smack
eat all you can
all you want
todays thanksgiving day for cats but only if they came back from the dead
he finishes with the gloves gets one of the loaded syringes out of his breast pocket holds it up squirts a drop out of the tip then moves toward church
church looks up
louis stops moving
church starts eating again and louis starts moving again as soon as he does
all the time he talks to the cat in that soothing voice
he bends down
and grabs him
church begins to squall and fight
louis holds onto him
he tries to get the syringe into the cat and church almost gets away
no you dont
the syringe plunges into his haunch
the needle is still dangling out of churchs haunch
the cat looks dazed
it tries to walk and falls over on its side
it tries to get up
and then falls over again
he walks to the porch steps and picks up the tote bag
any doubt he might have allowed himself the luxury of having is erased by the initials r
same as the cola
one of the few remaining strands of sanity has now parted
he looks back at dead
he climbs the steps and goes onto the porch
he strips off the rubber gloves
he tosses them onto the table beside juds beer cans as he goes inside
its dark in here and spooky
longer pause gage
he looks down and sees one of rachels shoes
it lies by the foot of the stairs
he goes over and picks up the shoe
its a three quarter heel and its pretty badly scuffed
rachel after all did some pretty hard travelling to get here
theres a spot of blood on it
sound a low giggle
louis looks up mighty dark
sound another giggle
gage voice lets play daddy
lets play hide and go seek
he takes one of the loaded syringes from his pocket
all right gage
he begins to climb the stairs
louis arrives on the landing
we begin the nerve wracking business of checking rooms
first the bathroom
and the shower curtain is of course pulled
louis yanks it back
he checks the linen closet
goes back to the hall
looks down it
he walks slowly along it
he checks one room
its a guest room
shadowy and empty
down the hall
a closet door
a bag falls off the top shelf and a bunch of ceramics inside it shatter loudly
louis flinches back
down the hall
now hes at juds room
he goes in
he checks the closet
he steps around the bed and sees a bloodstain
he gets down on his hands and knees and examines the bloodstain
he sees the skirt on the bedspread
he lifts it
he is nose to nose with jud who is dead with his eyes open an expression of incredible horror on his face
the door slams
louis bolts to his feet as giggles fade down the hall
slowly he kneels down and speaks to the skirt of the spread which has mercifully fallen back into place
im sorry jud
im so sorry
im theres a squeaking squealing sound
louis turns around
he gets up again
he starts for the door
then he turns back and speaks to jud again
im going to set things back in order
i know just what to do
he goes out
he takes one of the two remaining loaded syringes from his breast pocket
another squeaking sound
and another giggle
louis starts slowly forward
he gets about halfway down the hall and our nerves are tuned to the breaking point when there is a squealing creak and a grating thump from overhead
this happens fast
the trap which presumably gives on the attic with a set of folding stairs rises and rachels body plunges down through and then hangs swinging she has been bound around
the armpits and as become a grotesque parody of missy dandridge
half her face is gone
he screams and backs against the wall
the last silver thread parts
he leaps down crashes on the floor and then picks himself up
he is waving the scalpel
gage screeching allee allee in free
allee allee in free
allee allee in free
i wont choreograph all the moves but gage slashes his stunned father up pretty badly with the scalpel
hes screeching the whole time
louis finally begins to react
he grapples with the little critter and tries to get the syringe into him
its batted out of his hand just before he can do it
louis and gage fall to the floor
louis gets the other syringe out of his pocket but its also knocked out of his hand
only consolation is this one isnt broken
it rolls off along the floor
louis finally manages to get it again as the struggle goes on and plunges it into gages neck
he gets to his feet clawing for the needle lolling out of his neck
hes lost all interest in his father
he goes staggering away
hes slowing down
he goes to his knees
and falls on his face
louis watches this
and then his vacant half catatonic gaze goes to she swings slowly back and forth
time has passed
its late afternoon
louis comes out with a sheet wrapped form in his arms
rachel of course
he sets the body down and goes back inside
hes splashing around a can of coal oil
when hes got the room wetted down to his satisfaction he goes to the door lights a match and tosses it
flame runs across the floor
the fire is slow at first but then it begins to gain rapidly
louis goes out
he picks up the sheet wrapped form of his wife and walks around the side of the house as flames shoot through the kitchen windows
louis appears with his shrouded burden and approaches the road
camera holds for a moment then rises and looks toward the creed house
theres one light on in the kitchen
tolling continues three
louis is filthy covered with dried blood
he is playing at patience
he holds a handful of cards
tolling continues six
sound the back door opens
sound crickets from outside
ree ree ree
sound gritting footsteps
louis looks up
he doesnt look behind at whats coming
he looks straight ahead
and what you own always comes home to you
he flips up one card
tolling continues eight
its the bitch the queen of spades she who supposedly poisoned the laddies in the tower
louiss hand falls upon it
tolling continues nine
a hand clotted with grave dirt falls on his shoulder
a womans hand
tolling concludes eleven
rachel voice darling
