bones back this portion of the screenplay is originally pages
it is presented out of order to reflect the final film
most street lights shot out
just one or two of the eerie vapor lights left on the block
a middle aged african american man carries his single bag of groceries
the man listens and watches carefully as he negotiates the darkness between the few pools of light on the street
we wont see his face until he reaches the next pool of light but he walks with shoulders hunched in fear
moving down the block all shops abandoned
the man almost trips over a vague shadow passed out and crumpled in an abandoned doorway
its the crackhead we saw mumbling himself into the nod off zone
hes still faintly singing a part of the bones song as the man passes
he stops in the light
and we see its shotgun years of fear and loathing etched on his face
he freezes listening for a second to the crackheads wheezing mumbles no its something else hes listening for and hearing
from behind him a low wheezy sound like some huge panting dog
and it stops
he walks on and it follows as he hurries to the next pool of light and safety his ears strain for the nearly silent padding and wheezing steadily following
suddenly he hears that panting closer and closer until its nearly right behind him
he starts running though he hasnt yet seen anything
only heard the mongrel hot on his heels
as he stumbles careens and wheezes through the streets and alleys terrified
winded he eventually stops his hand trembling into his shopping bag seeking a weapon
and we see the building hes paused beside bones place
pockmarked by age
like the face of some furious old man
now he can almost feel the dogs breath on the back of his neck
shotgun spins whipping a bottle of milk out of the bag and hurling it into the darkness behind him
the bottle smashes against the wall of bones building
for a second silhouetted against the now whited wall the tall too tall shape of the skinny black dog
without waiting to see what he hit shotgun takes off running to reach his building across the street
the sound of the dogs nails skittering across the street right behind him and he just makes it inside safe panting for breath
then starts running up the stairs
from outside his third floor window we see shotgun run into his apartment slam down his groceries on the counter grab an old rifle from under his bed and hurry
to his open window
he scan aims out his window across the street to the now desolate building where bones once lived
finger on the trigger eyes scanning the shadows for the dog
mumbling quotations from the bible about canines some of which are handwritten and taped up on his walls and mirrors thou shalt not bring a dog into the house of
the lord thy god for they are an abomination
suddenly something moving on the empty street catches his eye
the black dog emerging from the shadows in the street
our first good look at the beast
long clawed paws all teeth and tongue and a curved bony rib cage like it hasnt eaten in years
its long black head seems almost to be throbbing moving from within almost subliminally we see a weirder demonic more skeletal dog face just beneath the black fur
or is it just the buzzing light from the vapor lamps
as he aims his rifle they return at evening snarling like dogs and prowling the city
the dog stands in the pool of light offering a perfect shot
shotgun smiles aims and then fires making a direct hit
but the dog doesnt move
the bullet must have missed
or else gone right through him
the long faced dog just looks up at shotgun like it was laughing at the fool
and has been for years
shotgun reaches for the spilled groceries on the counter
shoving aside bread and canned goods and other edible necessitates and finds a half dozen boxes of rifle rounds
he calmly reloads the rifle
and the sound of another shot echoes in the night over
two frat boys jason and palmer driving a too nice car in a too bad part of town
palmer at the wheel while jason makes a call on the cellular
just a backfire
like youd know
take a left no i mean a right
okay stop for a second
they stop in the middle of a block
jason on the phone
where the hell are you
on phone back here
at the end of the block
he turns around and sees behind them two guys standing on the far corner
ones on the phone
on phone you got the cash
you got the shit
on the phone yeah but you got to come the rest of the way on foot
leave your car and walk over here
they exit the car looking all around them with more than a touch of paranoia
as they walk nervously down the block they join the two on the corner
its stank and weaze both
let me see it
let me see it
hands him the money where is it
i cant carry it in my pocket man
and i cant go get it for you cause you might be a cop
you gonna have to pick it up yourself
jason and palmer arent sure about this
by the sphincteral look on his face palmer would rather forget about it
its just round the corner
halfway down that block you cant miss it
top step of the front stairs theres a loose stone
go on i aint shitting you
they walk around the corner and enter a bleak block with at least half the lots burnt out
is it too late for me to officially register my growing certainty that this is an extremely bad idea
farther down in the center of one side of the street stands a particularly ominous abandoned building
jason ignites a zippo and they see one loose brick
jason pulls it out and behind it sees a glint of baggy
easy as pie
and twice as tasty
he opens the bag
its filled with rock cocaine
on the third floor shotgun sits in his straight backed chair in front of the open center window drinking coffee cradling his rifle on his lap
sees the frat boys picking up their shit
then he looks out at bones tomb dark blank windows staring back at him the buildings front door covered with broken vertical boards with jagged pieces missing looking almost like
a jack o lanterns grin
shotgun then looks back down at the boys below
from behind them they hear their car alarm go off
someones screwing with the car
but from the other way come cops in a plain wrap car a hand reaching out and putting the spinning blue light on the roof
no place to run
no place to hide for the boys
they reach for the door of the shuttered building and it opens
you two get the hell away from there
but they ignore him and disappear into the darkness inside the gaping maw of bones building
shotgun shakes his head sitting back down cradling his rifle
inside the boys huddle in the darkness behind the door waiting for the cops to pass
the boys look around the decayed gothic interior lit only by the eerie glow of the sodium vapor lights outside
what we last saw as the ornate s luxury lobby in bones day is now a horror show
walls torn and stained
mold grows in patches on the wall and ceiling
huge cobwebs hang
the furnitures all broken
a gnawing tearing sound makes palmer spin a rat sticks its head up through the rotted cushions of the couch
lets get the hell outta here
jason shushes him as the room is filled with the flashing blue light of the cop car trawling slowly down the street
from inside they hear the sounds of a car door slamming and cop shoes walking
oh fuck cmon
he gropes his way in the darkness to a staircase
palmer is right behind him as they slip upstairs deeper into the gaping darkness of the abandoned building
while below them the door opens and cop lights and cop voices penetrate the gloom
not going in there
waste o time
i saw em go in
and from the boys high vantage point up the stairs we see the first cop walk in with flashlight drawn
all we see are two meaty hands unwrapping a wax paper covered pork chop sandwich
the cop face in shadow brings the drip ping sandwich up over his huge belly towards his face
the frat boys hold their breath while rats run across their feet
jason slamming his hand over palmers mouth to keep him from screaming
the young plainsclothes cop steps deeper into the room and shines his flashlight at the stairwell
jason pulls the reluctant palmer further up the stairs to the third floor as below them they hear the cop coming up
jason pulls palmer through the nearest door and into the rotted remains of what was once jimmy bones master bedroom
the room he was betrayed and slaughtered in
the cop begins to head up the stairs
visible behind him down through the open front door is the plain wrap car
the older cop inside mouth fulla sammich loudly says forget it
no way theyre in there
ive been working down here twenty years
no one goes in there
we watch as the younger cop returns to the car giving up
and when he climbs in we reverse and reveal who the older cop is lupovich the cop who helped kill bones
but hes decayed and expanded into a hank quinlan like mountain of corrupt cop flesh
too many pork chop sandwiches
lets get the hell outta here
from upstairs the boys see the blue light of the cop car recede as the car pulls away down below
palmer reaches for the door
he wants out
but in the darkness he cant find the door
gimme some light
behind jason we see a shape a shadow a tall silhouette a man shaped deeper darkness forming within the darkness
jason lights his lighter
and in the flickering we see behind him that this room now contains a portion of hell its not just the chipped paint and peeled rotted wall paper or the
cracks and gaps in the broken old ceiling mirror
all surfaces seem to be a swirling shifting pattern in which we can dimly and subliminally make out faces as if people were trapped on the surface of things
exactly like the glimpse we had beneath the world when jimmy died
the floor the walls the furniture everything in it made out of the wracked and twisted devouring and devoured forms of dead souls
their faces hollow pleading eyes and howling mouths visible like flowing grain in wood
and in the center of it all stands the dark silhouette of bones impossibly tall and thin stretching malevolently out across the room like a living shadow
but the boys dont see this as theyre finding the door
we see bones shadow arching towards them while they fumble
palmer finally opens the door to the sound of a deep rumbling growl from the darkness on the other side
and in the open door stands the black dog
they boys jump back
but breathes easy
just a dog
and the black dog leaps up at them teeth flying right for the boys throats
and in the flickering ghastly light we see its demon face breaking through
the dog sinks his long teeth into jasons arm
he flails and drops his lighter still lit on the floor
as soon as he does the dog releases jason and disappears as fast as it appeared back into the darkness
the two kids panic jason shaking and bleeding looking around waiting for the dog or something else to attack seeing back through the doorway into the room from hell
behind them we see that tall man shaped shadow
the bones shadow is oblivious to the two frantic boys intent only on the small flickering flame of the lighter still burning where it fell against the lower wood paneling
of the wall
a thin trail of black smoke as the flame barely begins to catch on the chipped lead filled flammable paint
and stumble down the hall away from the horror while back in the room the bones shadow watches as the lighter flickers and dies out
other than a slightly blackened spot the wall is unburned
the black shadow shudders in rage arches back and hooooowls in frustration its mouth abnormally large
the shadowy head snaps in the direction of the boys ready to vent its wrath and for a subliminal second we see in the head the hellish face of jimmy
the boys round the second floor landing and fly down the last flight of stairs
jasons foot breaks through a rotted floorboard and for a second it appears as though rotten hands are just below the stairs grabbing at his foot and leg
he yelps in terror pulling his foot back as they continue towards the front door the bones things woofer busting howl roaring down from the third floor
of pure horror and the desperation to survive drags the boys off the stairs as they tear across the floor and hurl themselves out the front door into the night
jason falling and lying on the stoop
across the street shotgun sees the boys in the doorway
then as a nearly dead vapor light suddenly flickers and comes to life the shadows created on bones building make it look almost like a demonic face
gulping for air laughing hysterically at their survival the frat boys pause
jason sits back on his butt checking his wound
the doorway behind them just a black hole in space
bumping fists together damn bro
that was close
something it happens so fast were not sure just what grabs sucks pulls palmer back into the black doorway hole
jason still prone tries to crawl away but whatever got his friend now sucks him in too
his fingernails scraping along the stoop in frenzied desperation
when he hears the boys pitiful screams and whimpers from across the street he leaps to his feet and tries to see into the dark of the doorway across the
but he can only hear what is happening to the unlucky frat fellas moans and the sound of flesh torn and swallowed and their last dying screams
the screaming reverberates
faces appear in some windows
while in others shades are drawn and the lights go out
mumbling to himself for outside are dogs and sorcerers
tears welling in his eyes that he angrily flicks away
it still has the shadowy look shape of jimmy bones now shifting again as the vapor light on the street sputters out again plunging the street into near darkness
the body of palmer no longer visible below
when he looks back the building seems just an old building again
then theres movement in an upper window catching his eye
shotgun sees the tall shadowy silhouette
the figure is elongated cant tell if it is a man or the distorted shadow of a man
it beckons to shotgun
just tightens his grip on his rifle and speaks as if the shadowy thing across the street could hear him
you still mad
still want me
come on and get me
shakes its head
as if it can hear him
and again mutely beckons to him
youre trapped there
well aint that too bad
aint that just too damn bad
this portion of the screenplay is originally pages

in the ghetto
a thriving street
shops and apartments
life in the hood
a sleek black buick electra deuce and a quarter floats down the avenue curtis mayfield style
behind the fur covered steering wheel shotgun a broke nosed bodyguard for the man in the back seat jimmy bones
cool handsome respected
dressed very fly but not excessive
long black coat black silk shirt and matching wide brimmed hat
his left hand sports a big diamond ring while his right hand toys with a long silver razor polished and oiled to perfection so that the long glinting blade can
swing back and forth or lock into position
bones steps out from the car on to his street like a benevolent feudal lord or a popular mafia don
greeting and soul shaking every man woman and child on the block they display a mixture of fear love and respect
coolly taking down numbers in a notebook soothing to the losers encouraging to the wary tough with the welchers
and handing out a rare win to an astonished old man standing in his pajamas in the doorway of an old tenement
dont spend it all in one place
spread it around
and shop local
this portion of the screenplay is originally pages
it is presented out of order to reflect the final film
we see pearl standing at the sink scrubbing the blood stains on her washing her hands washing and washing them
her hands washing becomes time passing
years decades the building and the surroundings decay
and still the dark skinny dog prowls the shadows
just one more reason we no longer see anyone walk the street at night
the s end and bones building stands worn and naked with burnt out lots on either side
and the street feels like a ghost town
in the evil colored light of the gaseous street lights bones own shadow stretches and distorts across all three stories
his shadow face filling a window
as in and around the building and out in the ruins on either side the black dog still walks
to the present
pull out and reveal pearl skin drawn eyes heavy now years older washing her hands
and then drying them

two raging black screaming skulls engulfed in eye scorching fluorescent green fire the decals on the front panel of a gemini executioner a hi tech mixer

were in a northside dance club pull out to reveal bill and maurice aka space cowboy and intergalactic gangster of love
the two boys dj ing
theyre accompanied by the crooning voice and dancing body of bills step sister tia
and maurice is not of this earth
bills turntablizing his hands dance between two competition style direct drive turntables tilted side by side playing them like an instrument
while maurice plays in and around and out of bills rhythm with his top loaded computerized cd players the boys hand the beat back and forth and up and down
building outrageously till maurice tips it over the top
goodness gracious grande bolas del fuego
the floor is jammed with underground dance scenesters college students and spaced out shoegazers tripping on ketamine dancing with their invisible friends
the bars surrounded by a sea of hands waving money demanding drinks
our boys are popular
and the club is making a lot of green tonight
see someone checking out all the money counting heads patrick bills older brother
the money man
stank and weaze are cruising around in the frat boys bmw laughing their asses off

across the club patricks arguing with the club owner moe

patricks not happy
the guys and tia stumble out with all their equipment loading it and themselves into patricks over sized suv
patrick right behind them
they gather around to split their fee

the space cowboy playing at illibent
whos club is that

patrick beckons them into the car
patrick pulls up to the abandoned lot next to bones building
in broad daylight the building looks even stranger
the lines dont matchup
weeds and broken glass rusted autoparts and empty abandoned shopping carts in tangled heaps like ruins in the lot beside the building
looks like a damn graveyard round here
im telling you this neighborhood is coming back
but just where the hell has it been
they step up to the front of the building
that is the ugliest building i have ever seen
i think its
something about it just buzzes me
that would be the after effects of that reticular inseminoid encounter you had
patrick opens the door and steps inside
welcome to the ill zone
the darkness broken only by sunlight streaming through grimy windows reveals the decaying interior of the building
we can see now nothings been moved since the late s
old furniture carpets pictures late s gothic
damn its cold in here
its eighty degrees outside
and its gotta be barely fifty in here
and damp too
lets not forget damp
can you picture it
over there the bar and in here the dance floor
patrick leads them to the stairwell going up and down around the old elevator cage shaft
i got a great deal on it
they couldnt give this place away
just dead meat stanking up their books for twenty years
they come to the elevator shaft no elevator in sight
the last owner on the lease before the bank was back in
some dude named jimmy bones
empty ever since
maurice looks down the elevator shaft and gets immediately dizzy almost plunging to his doom pulled back by bill
yeah you heard of him
not that i remember
he was a local legend back in the s
there was a song stagolee kinda deal this is the ballad of jimmy bones black as night and hard as stone
i was born near here

and this is patrick on crack

mia bill and maurice all climb the stairs as maurice lights a joint with a little box of stick matches
are you nuts
the man said just to use my imagination

yeah i get it
i can see it now
the first major urban theme park
village ghetto land
kinda like legoland but made entirely from broken glass hypodermic needles and crack vials
totally e ticket
keep smokin fool
tia checks out the second floor while bill and maurice continue up the stairs to the third floor
bones old crib
behind them barely subliminal glimpse a manshaped darker shadow within a shadow
bill feels a cold wind from nowhere
and hears a whispery sound seemingly carried in the breeze
it aint eh money
its the big fat floating what if
what did you say
i didnt say nothing
take him down to the storm clear
you didnt hear that
bury him or
take who where
what you smokin
tias checking out a bedroom
hears a light tinkling in a closet
she opens it empty except a row of rusty metal hangers holding the moldy remains of bones old suits
is there a flashlight poking around
trying to find the metal knob to turn on the gas
eerie as hell down there
out of the corner of our eyes we see a shadow moving looming
a scurrying sound and patrick turns his flashlight in the other direction we glimpse a bloated rat
behind him the shadow we glimpsed grows elongates
patrick notes another door
this one padlocked
sensing someone or something behind him patrick turns with the flashlight
but the bones shadow is behind him again
again he feels something and again he turns the flashlight around nothing
except the bones shadow is again
shaking it off patrick heads for the old heater pulling out matches to light the pilot as bones shadow stays behind him
bones watches as patrick reaches around the gas heater
when patrick strikes a match head the bones shadow moves even closer to him as patrick reaches in and lights the pilot
when patrick steps back bones shadow grows and stretches spreading like an ink stain reaching across to where the pilot flame flickers
in profile the shadow mouth blows
but no breath comes out
the flame doesnt even flicker
bones tilts his head back and lets loose an eerie bellow of frustration in a subliminal flash we see a howling mouth bigger than any human mouth howling within the
the sound echoes all through the basement rooms as patrick walks back upstairs
he slaps a nearby plumbing pipe
go on old pipes groan all you like
just please dont burst
that i cant afford
as disappointed in whatever he hoped blowing out the furnace pilot would do he steps into the rusted remains of the old elevator and the pov begins to levitate
bones pov rises straight up as if still in a working elevator
it rises and we follow up from the basement to the empty first floor past the second floor to where were still inside floating in the elevator cage
then the pov moves through the metal bars and floats towards bill whos approaching the door of the room where jimmy died
as bill reaches to open it bones pov floats closer and closer right up on bills back now
bill feeling the hairs on his neck suddenly rising
then he hears go on
it wont kill you
bill turns around to check with maurice
you had to hear tha
but maurice is gone
and he doesnt see the shadow there behind him
bill leans in to the door listening
i aint gonna be the only one with this niggers blood on my hands
what the f
a hand jolts him from behind
he spins its just maurice
must be buggin from hanging with you
they turn to walk back down
maurice stops to re light his joint when the bones shadow reaches out to grab his wrist
but its no good
the shadow hand passes right through maurice pauses for an instant as if he felt something
maurice lights his roach and the match burns closer and closer to his fingertips
then singes them and he drops the match
maurice then heads downstairs after bill
the shadow remains behind staring at the still burning match on the wooden floor
he bends down staring intently as if willing it to burn his hands urging it on the flame suddenly rising
but then the match sputters harmlessly out
the shadow turns back towards the boys downstairs
tia explores the rest of the floor
hears a sound like a whimpering from behind another door
she slowly eases open the door then jumps back inside the dog
it growls low and mean the black fur on the back of its neck rising
its eyes burning too red and bright
the dog growls deeply at her
and as he does we see the bones shadow rising behind her
it seems to lean in and over her and the dog stops growling
tia cautiously holds her hand outstretched with the burger for the dog to smell
bones shadow from lingers behind her perhaps simply enjoying the first sight in hellish eons of a beautiful girl
howd you get locked in here
and for how long
the dog leaps up but not to rip her throat out
instead it snatches the burger and wolfs it down in one gulp
you must be starving
bill looks skeptical maurice outraged
you want us to move in here
thats the only way well get the place fixed up in time
yeah right and which ever of us is still alive at the end of the week inherits all vincent prices cash

look who i found
she comes in with the dog padding silently behind her
damn thats the nastiest dog i ever seen
nothin but skin and bones
yeah call his skinny ass bones
bones grins all teeth with its tongue hanging out
they walk out the front door the dog slipping out with them
shotgun watches from the window as the group exits the building with the dog
seeing the cur he instinctively reaches for his gun
but the dogs surrounded by kids
hey watcha doing with that dog
he yours sir
then what do you care
take my advice
and shoot that dog
or let me
anything you say
tia bill and bones the dog pile into the van as pearl and her daughter cinnabar walk by
the daughters as fine now as her mother was then
pearl sees the dog in the van and her head snaps to the gang
dont feed that dog
you people really dont like dogs
some holes cant be filled
some hungers cant be satisfied
way under his breath and some people need their medication tweaked
im not joking boy
dont feed it
itll only make it hungrier
pearl walks a little faster trying to draw cinnabar away from the kids and the dog
but cinnabar lingers a few paces behind her mother and catches patricks eye
hes stunned and before he can speak maurice speaks for him
need any help with those bags maam
no really let us help

they stop in front of a storefront same old palm reading sign

pearl enters the building while a lingering cinnabar catches a look on patricks face
guess its not rossmore park
thanks for the help

patrick is still checking her out
and we can see from a window pearl is still checking him out
while maurice is checking out the wacky window design
yeah well if she got psychic powers how come shes working here on desolation row
a run down storefront fronted by a crude faux parisian black cat facade
a private club the local boss hq
inside the lights are dim and clouds of cigarettes and cigar smoke float over worn out old pool tables
most of the tables are empty
an older man wearing sunglasses lines up a careful shot on a corner table
its eddie mack
years after doing bones he rules the hood
whats left of it anyway
before he can shoot stank and weaze breeze in stank holding some car keys up in his hand
distracted eddie hits the eightball and scratches
he snaps the pool cue over his knee

the guarded entrance to the gated community
bill and the others roll up to the gate in their van
barney fife pokes his head in the window and stares at em suspiciously
they all smile back
okay go on ahead
i been living here my whole life and that hillbilly still has to check me out each time
hey its his job
keeping indesirables outta the hood
they pull into the huge multi car driveway in front of their house
not quite a mansion but damn close
the kids are all sitting around the kitchen watching tia fix some meaty concoction to feed the dog
the dog stares at her expectantly
jaws dripping in anticipation
an older distinguished looking black man walks in
and we see their father is
though now a prosperous banker twenty years ago he was the man who set bones up
he enters with nancy his white second wife tias mother
not only do i have to feed the three mouths i got and that bottomless pit they call maurice i gotta feed this stray too
at the sound of jeremiahs voice the dog looks up right at him and unleashes a low rumbling growl
its not nice to bite the hand that feeds you
what did you call that dog
moving on just what are you feeding him
i didnt know we had dog food
i used that meat you had in the bowl
tia that was the prime rib i was marinating for dinner
they look at the dog eating enough beef to feed six people

patrick talking to the others jeremiah asleep by now
when we got a line of hundred paying guests and another couple hundred inside dancing thats when ill tell him
and i cant wait to see the look on his face
around the table chinese food containers
tias still sneaking meat to the dog under the table
the tv on in the corner
jeremiahs topping off his dinner with xantac high blood pressure medicine
his normal dyspeptic mood not improved by the conversation the kids are having
and how do you think crack got into the ghetto
who flew it in
like the man said we dont own that many planes
jeremiah increasingly uncomfortable with the subject matter
dont poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia
thats all just ways of people justifying their own failure
dad the man has been lying to us for a hundred years
i mean where is my forty acres and a mule

jeremiah swears a painted smile on his face as he shakes the just entered lupovichs hand
they seem for all the world like old friends as he leads him back to his office
but the minute they are in his office jeremiahs friendly demeanor drops like a mask
what the hell do you want
just a visit with my old pal jay bird
dont call me that
lupovich looks around the expansive office and paws the photos and knicknacks on jeremiahs desk
you certainly traded up
picks up a wedding picture nearby the trophy wife
keep your hands to yourself willya
i been watching you
you done good
respectable businessman now
just like you always wanted
still a pig
just a much fatter one
no reason to get nasty
yeah ive stayed in the organization
but then again i never got the percentage you did
or you didnt know what to do with it
but that aint why i came to see you
you sold the building
dont shit a shitter
what did you call it
we had an agreement
you were supposed to sit on it
not sell it i didnt sell it
well somebody bought it
thats what i heard
could you come in here
an assistant manager claire enters
did we sell any properties on
matter of fact we did
i only met with the broker
the structure was listed almost worthless and had never even had a bid i thought youd be pleased to see it sold to someone who wants to improve the neighborhood
no of course not
thanks a lot
lupovich is still holding the picture of jeremiahs wife
one of my associates sold the building last month
thats a bozo no no
look even if anyone found anything there its twenty years ago
they could never connect it to us
you better hope not
cause its like they say four can keep a secret if three are dead
he puts down the photo with a wink
how old is thats it
jeremiah advancing on lupovich who chuckles and walks out
hes stopped by a kick under the table from patrick
thats some terrible shit
clean your mouth or i will
those boys had no business messing down there
go places youre not meant to be thats what you get
but thats your old hood pops
yeah and it took some doing to get out of there
just be glad i did and you can start life from here instead of down there
but maybe were the ones who should be down there
making it better
cant be done
that place already died and gone to hell

quick cuts of the moon the sun bones neighborhood patrick and the gang cleaning up the building
and finally at dusk
patricks on a ladder replacing glass in the upper windows
from down the block we see cinnabar heading out of her mothers house holding her portfolio
the corners of papers sticking out splashes of color visible
patrick sees cinnabar about to walk beneath his ladder
thats bad luck
that place is already bad luck
it goes way back
or so my momma says
what else does she say
youd think she was crazy
and she is a lot of things not all of them nice but crazy mommas not
way i figure everything our parents tell us is part true and part total b
and our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which
my momma says every house is two houses
every street two streets
theres a whole city a whole world kinda beside on top just below this one
the city of the dead
like right now theres actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us
fingers rotting off
but theres an invisible wall a fabric that kinda keeps things separate
but when something bad happens something really bad the wall breaks
the fabric tears
the dead get out
or the living fall in
and you believe her
if i did i wouldnt come within fifty yards of your door
she sees her bus pulling up at the corner and runs for it leaving only her smile with patrick
she passes maurice and bill pulling up
bill has to pull maurices dog like attention away from the way cinnabars bottom moves as she walks down the street to focus at the matter at hand unloading their
shitload of equipment
this portion of the screenplay contains scenes that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie
in order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay it has not been edited
maurice and bill carrying speakers and racks and lights and turntables while shotgun in his lawn chair across the street glares at them
after the last equipment is loaded they lock the car
shotgun still watching
bill pulls out a six pack of beer
he offers one to shotgun who after a beat accepts it
maurice surreptitiously turns on his small hi camera
holding it under his arm but its on
you ever hear of jimmy bones sir
what business is it of yours
we heard he used to live in our building
shotgun says nothing
is it true
he lived there
and died there too
how the hell should i know
what was he like
he was something
he could be cold as ice or warm as blood
but he never turned his back for a brother
his eyes drift up to the building
maurice goes in
bill lingers behind
take my advice
get the hell out of there
its a bad place
always has been
bill and maurice walk around interviewing folks about bones
bill with the dat recorder maurice with the vidcam
we see this through maurices shaky video camera grainy video shots an old woman
and every tuesday hed roll by in his car and drive me with all my laundry to the laundromat so i wouldnt have to carry the clothes
a dude in a wheel chair
drinking outta paperbagged bottle with a wino hanging on the corner
yeah i knew that motherfucker
people make out like he was some kinda damn robin hood
i saw him cut some muhfuckers tongue once with that razor of his
dropped it right into that jar of dill pickles they used to have on the counter in the bar
when i was a kid he used to slip twenties into my pocket so i could buy toys and shit
now to maurice at camera bones was awrright
he was solid
and then one day he just wasnt around no more
dont pay to ask too many questions round here
upstairs inside what was once bones bedroom
beneath the cracked ceiling mirror bill lies on the airmattress
hes listening with headphones to a minidisk player
eyes closed head nodding to the beat
around him we see something strange
the room shifts
its the same room
it looks like it did when the frat boys were trapped in here
or in the instant after jimmys death all surfaces seem to be a swirling shifting pattern in which we can dimly make out faces as if people were trapped on
the surface of things
then the faces and bodies begin to step out of their surfaces and into the room
so as bill eyes still closed rocks to the hypnotic beats in his headphones we see the room around him begin to fill with figures
all twisted dead human forms emerging out of the surfaces of floor and walls
we hear a low murmur of ghost voices different languages
and as the track ends the sound cuts through bills headphones and his eyes snap open
but the room is empty
and completely normal
bill pulls off his head phones
ears strain to listen
the sounds return fainter and form above
bill looks up and for a fraction of a second in the mirror bill sees the crowded eerie hell of the other version of the room
bill jolts out of bed and to the door whips it open and someone dark looms right there
but its just patrick
bill looks back into the room normal now
glances up at the mirror just a cracked reflection of the empty room
maybe just a little
yeah there is a strange vibe here
both brothers look at each other waiting for the other to admit hes seen or felt somethings here
wheres the others
tias taking a bath
the bathroom is entirely wood lined like some s hot tub paradise
the room dominated by a large two person tub
tia lights four small scented candles on the counter
the wind through the open window blows the curtains
she shuts the window and then steps gingerly into the steaming bathtub
she lies down in the bath with her back to the door
the four candles throwing varying shadows of her
then one of the shadows becomes
the shadow of bones
all its attention is focused on one lit candle
the one closest to the curtain
slowly the bones shadows fingers start to caress the curtain to make it move ever so slowly closer and closer to the candle
the drapery reaches out straining straining towards the candle flame
tia soaks with her eyes closed enjoying the moist heat
bones shadow fingers more and more urgently drawing the flame towards the curtain the curtain towards the flame
and soon the corner of the drape just reaches the little flickering flame
and in an instant the drape is on fire
patrick and bill still talking in front of the bedroom down the hall from the bathroom
we just been in the damn suburbs too long
their conversation interrupted by screams from down the hall
from the bathroom
the drapes are fully ablaze now flames lick at the wooden walls
tia leaps out of the tub screaming trying to throw bathwater at the burning drapes
patrick and bill crash through the door
patrick rips the drapes from the wall and throws them into the bathtub
tia shivers in her bathrobe
bill and patrick with her
there wasnt any draft
that window was closed
were all tired
everybody makes mistakes
tomorrow in the daylight everythings gonna look different
ladders drop cloths and the beginnings of new paint on the old torn walls
theyre all eating take out burgers
i thought you were bringing the colonel
the gangster of love dont eat no fried chicken
he eats everything else
just what army do you think the colonel was in
whistles dixie everybody knows the whole chicken distribution network is owned by the klan
im telling you
theres something in the batter
say it makes a black man sterile
i saw it on sixty minutes
maurice even if it was true what are you worried about
last time i checked you werent black
im not sure what the hell you are
but i know you arent a black man
i am the future
i am all colors

outside angle on bones building down the block
to the building we can hear sounds coming from inside the house
like dim drums some kind of rhythm
where the dog eats and eats
the sound is a little louder a little more disturbing
where the dog eats and eats
standing now right in front of it we hear a rhythmic cacophony from inside growing louder as the dog eats and we the sound is deafening
its the sound of every door in the empty house swinging maniacally on its hinges
beating the air like wings
opening and slamming shut again and again
every door except one door
the padlocked door to the sub basement
some older folks one very old man with a cane two old black women arms linked
a middle aged husband and wife
cloth covered table
everything set for a seance
make yourselves comfortable around the circle
well begin in a minute
she walks upstairs to cinnabars room
she enters the room where cinnabar is drawing a still life assignment by a window overlooking the fire escape
arent you going to join us
i have to finish this for class
you got a vision girl
just like i got
just like my momma had
and the good lord didnt give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures
thats just wasted time
you mean as opposed to your life
she regrets it halfway out her mouth
and a thousand fold more when she sees the look on her mothers face
im sorry momma
maybe next time
i dont want you meeting around that house
you stay away from those kids
and away from that dog
they seemed alright
bring a little life to that old building
nothing but a wide world o pain locked in there
have you ever been inside
maybe once upon a time
but that was long ago
before it became what it is
and whats that
just a bad place
and the doorway to worse
cinnabar as far too often not understanding much of what her mother says to her

pearl reaches into an old bureau drawer and pulls out an old photo jimmy bones with his arm around her
she sits down at her table with a drink and just looks at the picture of herself and her lover when the world was innocent and young
she downs her glass and wipes her tears away
in the upper window of the bones building we see his silhouette staring down the block towards pearl
bones the dog slinks into the kitchen
sniffing the air
his big black paw actually opens the refrigerator
with his long nose he digs into the meat drawer
inside he finds plastic wrapped raw hamburger meat
he pulls it out and drops it on the floor
tears it open and gorges himself on the raw meat
the house looms malevolently in the moonlight
bones pov again in his rusted elevator cage
the pov floats down through the house into the basement
bones pov looks at the padlocked door
then passes right through it
in the deeper darkness of the dirt cellar we see the bones shadow hovering over a slight mound in the dirt
the black dog wolfs down the last of the hamburger meat
and as he does the ground seems almost to breathe or glow
bones plunges his long shadow hands right into the earth as if he could touch what was beneath and raise it up
he remains like that shadow hands buried in the dirt head tilting back and howling
shotgun up in his window still holding his gun
hears the howling
he looks around expecting to see his nemesis the black dog
but only darkness
jeremiahs mansion stands in the moonlight
its faux gerogian splendor in stark contrast to bones building in the old neighborhood
the house is dark and quiet
all are asleep
the dog moves silently through the house sniffing at doors
the dog silently noses the door open and stealthily enters and pads softly over to jeremiahs side of the bed
where it stares intently at the sleeping jeremiah who begins to toss and turn
he settles again on his back
his head tilted back his soft vulnerable throat exposed
the dog steps closer to the bed
we can almost feel the dogs hot fetid breath inches away from his throat
the dog stares at jeremiah
and for just a second the long doggy face wavers and changes in shifting shades of black a ragged red demonic face ripples beneath the black fur and looks for
an instant as if it were about to lunge and rip out jeremiahs throat
but at the last second it freezes
head cocks and ear lifts as if hearing something in the wind
its masters voice perhaps
and then the dog reverts to normal and pads out of the room as silently as it entered

cinnabar stops outside the building
shes about to knock when she instinctively freezes
we can almost see the hairs standing up on her neck one by one
she looks around what is it
a sound like a moan
is it her name
or just the wind
suddenly with a creak the door swings open
she takes a hesitant step into the building
suddenly she jumps as a door to her left flies open
its just patrick
she laughs in relief
just thought id see if you needed any help
patrick too surprised and tongue tied to respond so tia helps him out
we do need help
first you can help us eat lunch
cinnabar follows patrick into the room with a last tense look over her shoulder still the feeling somethings there
tias feeding the insatiable dog
handing quarter pounders to it the thing scarfing em as fast as she can unwrap them
then for a second it stops
and looks up
and just stares at something it knows is there but we humans cant see
watcha looking at poochie
cinnabar follows the dogs glance
she sees nothing
or is there something for a second there in the corner
is staring back at her and at the dog
cinnabar pulls her sweater around her shoulders
i hate it when dogs do that
like theyre looking right out of the world
the dog continues scarfing down burgers having him his way
cinnabar looks warily at the beast
who stares right back at her while wolfing down the burgers
steps through the rusted metal into the old elevator shaft and we follow it as it floats down
as the dog above eats we again see bones shadow form looming over the seeing dirt the dirt moving ever so subtly and for a subliminal second the dirt seems
to be glowing
theyre all painting
maurice spins some tunes to accompany them
its a funky tom sawyer paint party
the kids defer to cinnabar whos got a wild pallette and a wild brush
the place is coming alive with color

in bones old room patrick rolls over the faded stained old shag carpet with a huge carpet cleaner
the transparent tubes of the cleaner fill with disgusting red fluid and carpet fibers
patrick stands back and surveys his work
the carpet looks perfect
old a little faded but clean
with a smile of satisfaction he rolls the cleaner out of the room and closes the door behind him
we remain in the room
the now clean carpet
suddenly we see glutinous red liquid seeping back up through the shag until the stain is right where it was
wet and fresh
then we see it spread and move in the shape of a body and the path by which it was dragged out of the room
the door opens again and patrick steps in to show off the freshly painted room clean rug to cinnabar and the others
hes brought up short by the sight of the stain
must be something seeping through
from the floor
they roll the carpet back thinking there must be something on the floor
the floor beneath the carpet is wet too but cant tell if its from the rug or vice versa
he puts his hand down on the wood
a low rhythmic rumbling
do you feel that
the others place their hands on the floor
like a heartbeat
like a heartbeat like a love beat
listen to the di franco twins there
just the plumbing or something fool
maybe theres a pipe underneath the floor
it leaked and stained
they just look at him
you got a better explanation patrick and the others in the basement listening to some very strange sounds groans thumps throbs
sounds like we got the invisible scratch piklz hiding in our pipes
patrick traces the piping with the wrench he comes to a triple corner where three small pipes all come together
i think these bring the water down from the bathroom
a larger pipe that goes down the wall and disappears beneath the floor
the thumping sounds emanate from here
he puts his finger along the seam of the joint
he pulls it away red
check it out
the same shit that was in the carpet
told you it was from the plumbing
he lifts the wrench to tighten the seal
the metal groans
sending a thick spray of foul smelling red sludge shooting out of the seam right into patricks face
damn i knew these pipes were wacked
he turns the wrench the other way re tightening
the sound seems to move now through the piping
then the red sludge sprays out of the next three joints smearing the others
the pounding throbbing sounds begin to bounce around the room as if something were actually moving through the pipes until it returns to the central large pipe and moves down
disappearing beneath their feet
then a rasping bark calls their attention
bones the dog sits by the padlocked door panting
patrick smashes the old lock with the large wrench and opens the door to reveal another set of stairs leading down into a deeper storm cellar where the sound disappeared
as they go the temperature drops
a cold damp sheen appears on their skin
then comes a thick glutinous buzzing sound
what is that
the stairway walls are thick with furry black flies
muchos moscos man
this is too much
just some flies
i think this qualifies as way more than some
what a smell
hey what you expect
where theres smoke theres fire
and where theres flies theres shit
the stairs end in a dark damp dirt cellar and the remnants of the terminus of the old elevator shaft
oh yeah i guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio
maurice man shut the fuck up
yeah well maurice is right
its gonna take more work than i thought
but we can still do it
well lay a real floor in here
put damping on the walls
totally controlled sound
no one could hear shit up on the street
behind them the dog is digging in the dirt
we can make our first record where no one can hear us scream
theyre not paying any attention to the dogs incessant digging
only cinnabar is
shes staring at it
and she sees in the deepening muddy hole at the dogs paws at first glimpses and then the full view a rotted human corpse
really just a skeleton
with something sticking out of its chest
cinnabar shrieks while the guys try very hard to act real cool
maurice bends and pulls out the now blood rusted razor
boys and girls moms and dads
children of all ages id like you to meet
what the hell you talking about
singing this is the story of jimmy bones black as night and hard as stones gold plated deuce like the king of siam got his switchblade loose and a diamond
on his hand
theres the switchblade and theres the diamond
dont know where the deuce is parked
he points to one of the bony hands
the left one
on the third finger is jimmys big diamond ring
you think thats really him
and hes right
oddly for an old skeleton there are strands and bands of wet raw flesh
maurice lifts the hand wearing the ring
he starts top pull it loose from the finger
boy put that thing down
you cant take that
might be evidence
evidence of what
somehow i dont think he stabbed himself in the chest then buried himself too
cinnabar sees something
bright color beneath the body
bends down to a piece of cloth poking out from beneath the bones
the dog growls viciously as she reaches down to the scrap of color poking up
tia restrains the hound the best she can
get your damn dog girl
the cloth is the corner of a dress
the dog suddenly lunges for cinnabars hands ripping at them
she pulls back
we gonna have to do something about you
what we have to do is call the police
call the police
well have no problem getting our permits then
we cant just leave it here
yeah we can
least till after this weekend
he aint going nowhere
well deal with it then
whatever lets just get the hellout of here
they all start to leave except maurice and cinnabar
hes loitering by the body eyeing the ring
shes staring into the dark corner of the sub basement
she sees something wavering a shadow mirage bones
she follows the others upstairs
bones watches her form as she climbs the steps and for a second from bones pov we see her mother when she was young
bones looks now at maurice
who checks to see if the others are gone
then maurice hurriedly bends down and while holding his face back away from the stench attempts to pull bones ring off his finger
but its stuck
he tugs again harder and rips the corpses finger off
oh fuck is right
bones shadow rears as it sees this desecration
maurice slips the ring off the finger stump
to the corpse sorry but you wont be needing this
he places the finger back by the hand
and pockets the ring
tia fills a bowl with dry dog food
but bones the dog turns his head away and just whimpers
she pulls out a package of raw hamburger dumps it into the bowl then leaves
behind her the dog tucks into his chow
the lock broken the door stands ajar
and as the dog gorges upstairs something very strange is happening down here
flesh is growing on the bones
bit by bit red wet strips of muscle and flesh appear and spread over the corpse
the shadow looks down at his semi reconstituted corpse
it almost looks like him minus the skin
but it still has a long ways to go
still mere strips of muscle and flesh on the skeleton

her usual small crowd arrives for her seance all hoping this will be the night they reach their loved ones spirits
from outside through the window we see pearl greet and seat each of them around the table
she starts lighting candles
patrick and cinnabar sipping a little remy in his room
alone at last
he refills her glass
she doesnt want me here
in this house
believe me my old mand rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here
all he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this hood as possible
he probably thinks hes saving you from something
im sure thats what my mother thinks
im sure i can make your mother like me
but then do i gotta worry bout your father
suddenly their banter is dead
her face looks stung like hed slapped her
i dont know anything about my father
i never met him
momma wont talk about him either
he puts his arms around her and she melts into him
pearl and the others seated in the dim room around a circular table
they are holding hands
only candle light
we should begin with a hymn
in bones old room the temperature between cinn and patrick goes from pg to r
the two kiss passionately deeply cinnabar loses herself for a long beat then as if swimming up from the bottom of a deep pool she pulls herself back
if you want to go home
no i want to stay with you guys
but i cant
i mean im not ready
dont worry about it
ill stay with the boys
from outside through the open window we can hear the strains of singing coming from her window
we float around the members of pearls circle
see objects on the table flickering in the candlelight
the spirit world is all around us right this minute
and the departed are pressing in around us
still singing they all glance about them in darkness as if they can make out the spirits around them
over the low bass of their hymn singing her voice cuts in
uncoiling and rising like smoke in the air its a beautiful voice and it does seem to open a window in the air
cinnabar gets into bed and turns off the light
pitch dark in there cant see a thing
as shes drifting off to dreamland she hears what sounds like the door quietly opening and someone slipping into the darkness of the room we just stay on her face
its cold in the place
so she doesnt mind when she feels what she assumes is patrick slip in bed beside her
though we see only a shape sliding under the covers
half asleep its okay just dont get funny on me
its warmer this way
suddenly the curtains fly open
and pearls voice suddenly stops
and the flame on the candle shoots up scorching the ceiling before returning to normal
someones with us
whos joined the circle
whats that smell
the flowers whither
they retch from some smell
knock once for yes
and twice for no
is there someone who wishes to send a message
table rocks once
a message for one of us in the circle
table rocks once
is it for miss lillian
table rocks twice no
is it a message for mr
table rocks twice no again
she goes around the room inquiring for each of them
each time the table says no
until there is only her left
an eerie pause
is the message for me
the table starts bucking wildly
and suddenly pearls neck snaps back like its been caught in a whip
her mouth opens and a low moan escapes
but sounds nothing like her voice
a deep wind through an organ tube with swarming bees and squealing hogs mixed in
everyone around the table just stares at her in alarm
as her eyes widen
go super close on her eyes and we see a reflection in her pupil not of the room she is in but the jimmys building twenty years ago
intercut with her face back in the seance staring wide mouthed in her trance
the sound of her heart pounds like the deepest dub track
total dislocation for her as she sees jimmys old room as it was but also sees it as it is now and with her daughter cinnabar lying underneath the covers
of the big round bed
and lying close beside her another figure beneath the covers
whoever is there snuggles closer to cinnabar
she responds as he presses against her then wakes up
laughing low cut it out
but he doesnt
the movement beside her is undulant
strong erotic she almost gives into it
and still laughs as she says no no patrick
the figure in the bed presses urgently against her in a rocking movement which catches her up in it
she cant help it she begins to respond to the urging behind her
pearls eyes widen as the whole room shifts and becomes one fetid necropoliptic texture
the bed retains its shape but liquefies seems to become one with the floor and the walls all made of a kind of thick bloody mud in which the trapped
faces and distorted limbs of the dead twist and moan
meanwhile on that strange bed the figure behind cinnabar seems to wrap soft limbs around her locking her in embrace
cut it out
but it doesnt cut out
she almost gives in to it
no no patrick
but the movement is more insistent
she starts to protest louder when she feels a hand or something steal across her mouth to muffle her objections
pearl tires to reach across her vision to grab her daughter and help her but she cant
back at the seance pearls back is arched like a bass fiddle string bowed and then drops
back in her chair
the instant shes returned to herself shes out of her chair and out the door
cinnabar struggles with something in the bed the covers pulled tight against her face she cant scream
she twists and wrenches herself about finally striking behind her with a flailing fist twists her face free and screams patrick
across the room the door suddenly opens its patrick
the black silhouette of the dog slips out the door
are you alright
cinnabar looks wildly around the room shes alone in the big bed
no one attacking her
and she sees patrick in the doorway
but then who or what was in the bed
suddenly her mother yells from below
cinnabar lurches out of the bed over to the window
down below her mothers going nuts at the entrance pounding on the door and practically running over bill whos opening the door
outta my way boy
why dont you hang on and ill see if shes here
i know damn well shes there
cinnabar races down the stairs with patrick bewildered at her heels
cinnabar runs out the door and straight into her mothers arms burying her face in the protective bosom of her mom
pearl wraps her frightened daughter in her arms and turns her to home
pearl looks up at the boys standing stunned in the doorway
you might as well just dig down six feet of muddy earth and sleep in your own grave than stay another night in that house
she turns back towards her place still holding the sobbing cinnabar
bill and patrick stand stunned in the doorway
you sure got a way with women bro
what happened up there
damned if i know
up on a ladder the boys put on the finishing touches and then hang a new neon sign over the door
looks pretty cool
were in business
heading south on lake shore drive a tensely smiling patrick in the front seat with jeremiah
where are we going
you know i hate surprises
a little business move i made
on my own
i think youre gonna approve
heading off the main road into the ghetto
but as they head further and further south jeremiahs getting uneasy
what are we doing down here
like you always said pop look for the undervalued
now they are on the old street
as they drive down the street jeremiahs getting more and more agitated
they park and get out
he looks up and down the street oddly frightened
i bet you didnt even know your bank owned the place
i did it through a broker so you wouldnt know it was me
i couldnt wait to see your face when i fixed it up
its the building
freshly painted with the neon sign
but jeremiahs face shows nothing like what patrick expected
nothing but a horrified angry disgust
is this some kind of sick joke
jeremiahs so angry he almost smacks patrick
listen to me boy
i didnt work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in
i thought youd be psyched
just trying to do what you did
take nothing and make something out of it
no onell ever come here
shut it down
dont worry the bankll buy it back
ill take care of it
youll take care of it
not this time
i bought it fair and square
and we open tonight
youre selling it back
thats an order
jeremiah is furious out of all proportions
some of the others on the block have stuck their noses out to see what the fuss is
then jeremiah comes eye to eye with pearl standing across the street watching worried out of her mind
then he looks up and sees shotgun in the window
feeling trapped humiliated
he wants out of this street
out of those glances
you all are coming back to the house now
jeremiah walks back to his car and pulls away
patrick frozen turned to stone by rage and hurt and shame
another car pulls up
several young people inside
they look around a little dubiously
man i think were lost
you guys know where illibent is
they all look at each other
until maurice answers by flipping a switch igniting the neon sign for the first time
illibent shines in brilliant blue gas letters

the deuce and a quarter stops in front of a storefront
a young nefertiti in platforms and dashiki picks fresh fruit and vegetables from the small grocery
ill walk the rest
pearls picking ripe fruit
jimmy steps in catches her hands and the melon in them in his hands
naw all wrong
first start at the belly button
he strokes his thumb over the end of the cantaloupe leaning in to her
gotta be an in ey and gotta be smooth
if its ragged it was picked too soon
wont ever be ripe
second its got to have just a little give here
his hands on her hips at the edges
and last but not very far from least
now only a breath apart you gotta get your nose in it and give it a gooooood looooong sniff
i dont know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese or rip you open and eat you right here
she chooses the latter they kiss
jimmys walking pearl home an apartment above the storefront of her mothers fortune telling business
listen baby i gotta tcb this evening
so come over bout eight
we should be finished by then
jimmy arrives home to be greeted on the steps of his building by soul shakes and black hand fives from the corner boys hanging out front
follow bones into the lobby with people waiting to see him for favors etc
rooms on either side doors open allowing us to glimpse his crew taking orders over the phones
an old fashioned metal cage elevator with an equally old fashioned operator waits to take mr
jimmy up to his pad
we ride up with him the king in his castle
the elevator lets him out in his main room
a s love pit
mirrored ceiling circular bed
thick shag carpeting
jimmy nods at shotgun who lowers the needle into classic vinyl groove of some prime funkadelic nappy dug out
jimmy splashes cologne on his face and looks contentedly out the window at all his people at his kingdom below
the cop we saw with jeremiah lupovich and the wannabe player eddie mack wearing an old superfly suit and sleek black driving gloves pull up in front of the old
shotgun mixes drinks at the bar and hands them to the just arrived guests jeremiah officer lupovich looking stiff in plain clothes and eddie mack in his purple suit
hey jimmy you know eddie mack dont you
yeah we used to do the after school b ball at kenwood
what it is
what it will be
and officer lupovich
bones says nothing
just nods at the cop
you got a nice crib here
i do alright
but things change
you gotta think ahead
they got lotteries all over now bonesy
coming here too maybe next year
bones look sez bitch dont call me that again
half our old customers are gonna be getting their people to cross state lines to pick up lotto tickets
besides theres more money to be made in the gin than the juice
what do anybody want with numbers anyway
it aint the money its the high
the big fat floating what if
and its way more profitable
nobody ever wins
so you never have to pay out
but a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty dollar bag
yeah but i aint talking horse
im talking about a five dollar kick in the head thats a quick ticket to heaven
and the fools keep coming back for more
those fools are my people
aint no big thang
its just a po mans free base
here check it out
eddie pulls a little rock of crack out
jimmy takes it in his hand and sniffs it
then shrugs and hands it back
i aint interested
and if you gonna sell it dont sell it round here
just try it
i said no thanks
it wont kill you
back off huggybear
its like this jimmy
theres a wave coming
a big ass krakatoa east of java wave
and either you gonna be on top of the wave up there in chocolate heaven or you gonna be buried neath the muddy undertow
totally wide screen sci fi
i respect that
but that aint my life
im here and now
comfortable as a bed bug on a cold night in a warm nappy dugout
thats what its about for me
and your twelve and a half minutes is up
jimmy just walks away from him
eddie and lupovich and jeremiah all look at each other frustrated
lets go loopy lou
jimmy aint into it
gonna skip the money train and take the bus
lupovich turns but then spins back around with a
in his hand and its pointed at jimmys forehead
jeremiah didnt expect this or did he
everybody just be cool
jimmy man i think you oughtta hear the deal
i dont need to hear the deal
i dont need any partners
i dont need new product
and i sure as hell dont need this motherfuckers mattie in my face
just try it jimmy
he hands him the rock
and a little pipe
you heard the man
bones keeps his eye on him as he lights the lighter and takes a deep puff
then lets out a deep cloud of smoke
his eyes go a bit glazed
and from his pov we see the room start to tilt on its axis as everything goes wobbly
just then the door opens and pearl steps in distracting lupovich for an instant
in one eternal crack fueled fast and slo mo second jimmy sees his chance he pulls his razor but too slow lupovich turns the razor no more than lightly slices
his arm and he pulls the trigger on jimmy bones
pumping three shots into jimmys abdomen knocking him to the ground
shotgun grabs his gun but too late
aint worth it blood
just drop it
and kick it here
pearl in screaming shock
her lover bleeding on the carpet
tell her to stop screaming
bones is bleeding and still tripping bad
i said stop that bitch screaming or ill spread her like butter
shotgun gently puts his hand on pearls mouth to quiet her
looking down he sees his own blood pouring out a thick divine river of many colors
looking up they all stand wavering above him hungry demons their voices distorting
get his razor
i aint gonna be the only one with this niggers blood on my hands
mack plucks bones silver razor right out of his hands
take the gloves off
everybody leaves a print
we hang out together
or we hang separately
and cut him good
eddie pulls his glove off and enjoys himself as he shoves the razor into jimmy
what it is
what it will be muthafucka
no way man
you cut him or i shoot you
make your choice
jeremiah gets down near bones
bones stares right into his eyes as his life blood pours freely weakly lifts his arm to his best friends face
jeremiah feels lupovichs gun behind his head
hears it cocked
sorry my brother
since we was just grasshoppers
you always told me its a dog eat dog world
and he thrusts bones razor right between the ribs
bones eyes tighten but never lose their lock on jeremiahs eyes
his mouth moves as if hes trying to speak
instead he spits a bog of blood right into jeremiahs face
a shaken jeremiah hands the bloody razor to shotgun
just do it
he wont even feel it
bones eyes bore into shotguns
eyeing his gun on the floor feeling the one on the back of his neck calculating his chances
then shotgun slices him
bones flinches he definitely still feels it
shotgun hands the razor back to eddie
now you girlie
same deal all around
or die with him
she takes the razor and slowly kneels beside her dying lover
her hands trembling
theres no way she can do it
lupovich brings the gun to the back of her head
ill be better off
bones reaches one hand round the back of her neck weakly storking her there
and with his other hand bones takes her wrists and pulls her hand towards him burying his razor in his heart
his eyes roll back and his hand falls away and hes gone
she drops her hand from the razor which remains sticking out of his chest a river of blood pouring from around it
as his spirit rises and rises up to the ceiling looking down on them as they stand watching his body bleed to death
pearl just stands there completely covered in his blood
then in a frantic daze tears her dress off
jeremiah gently takes her bloody dress
from above bones can hear them speaking below but its as if they were speaking far away
too risky to take him outside
take him down to the storm cellar and bury him
and get rid of this too
tosses pearls bloody dress let this whole damn building be his tomb
shotgun and lupovich drag bones body out of the room leaving behind a deep wet blood stain in the shag carpet
as he stares down in horror at all this
above him it seems he can see right through the ceiling to the night sky and a swirling light opening above his head
is floating upward towards the light but then he looks staring down at the sight of his body in a deep puddle of blood and his murderers removing his womans
dress covered with is blood
as he sees this his and ours pov changes becomes darker yet clearer too sharp razor sharp as some softness perhaps life itself drains out of it
bones sees his best friend jeremiah and lupovich together dragging his body out the door leaving a thick wet stain behind him
we can hear jimmys last wail of rage twist and distorts in the air becoming another deeper voice within the voice
and then he and we plunge back down to the ground right to the dark wet stain in the carpet
hit it and go down through an instants glimpse into the black sea beneath the foundation of the world necropolis
where space itself seems to be made of pale bloated gnawing writhing things
bodies perpetually devouring themselves and each other
we see through this dog eat dog nightmare back out through the blood stain as through a key hole slowly closing

a line out front
everybodys gonna get in
patrick alternates between tending the crowd and throwing anxious glances down the block towards cinnabars home
torn between exhilaration at seeing his dream come true and disappointment that cinnabars not there to share it
people chomping to get in
across the street shotgun watches with dismay
patrick hears voices down the street
looks up to see cinnabar walking towards the club
his smile freezes when he sees pearl right behind her
trying to stop cinn
ive seen things
you did too
dont tell me you didnt
you were crying like a baby
you said the vision the images
theyre just that
they cant hurt you
thats what you always said
all the more reason i should be here
its for your own good
you said bad things hurt places
so maybe good things heal them
good things are happening here
maybe for the first time ever
and maybe thats all it takes
pearl sees she cant stop cinn
any more than her mother could have stopped pearl when she was her age
i hope so child
i really hope so
she can only watch as cinnabar gives patrick a big hug and follows him and the rest of the crowd into the club
the place is unfinished
but all the cooler for it
the bar is crude
cheap beer and jug wine
but the crowd dont mind
the place is alive
the boys are on fire
a packed floor of dancers move as sound and image break beat and maurices voice erupts in deep dub reverb
the gangsta of love is in the house
hits the reverb and it echoes
in the house
throughout the house the video interviews the guys did and mixed like audio samples with old blaxploitation clips and other video oddities the boys came up with
ill bill is in the house
and over maurices gothic drum and bass bill starts turntabling some seriously dark funk
coming ominously down the third floor stairs
jimmy bones is in the house
this is the story of jimmy bones
black as night and hard as stones
the dog now on the second floor stairs
bones ol bones so mean and bad whupped his mamma shot his dad
saw bones ol bones on top of the hill
rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills
lord he never worked a day and he never will
bill builds lets the record spin then pops the kill button
the tune fades in a distorted way as he start stops start stops it forcing the sound backwards and forwards
as maurice twiddles dials and distorts it all further its spooky but way funky
is now in the house too
walking through the throbbing crowd making a path right through them most of the dancers paying it no mind its just another part of the trippy scene
or do they even see it
we cant tell
and its single minded concentration
staring straight ahead as it moves through the crowd towards maurice who for a second notices the dog coming but making nothing of it
what its staring at
bones old ring on maurices finger
when he looks back he sees not a dog but a beautiful black woman a dark lady who only has eyes for him
dancing seductively drawing a crowd as she moves she stares straight ahead at maurice
maurices joint droops from the corner of his mouth as he realizes yes
this world class beauty is most definitely flirting with him
the dark ladys still throwing him deep looks as she dances off the floor and then disappears up the stairs making maurice lean into bill
can you take a little extended solo right about now funk soul brotha
go for it
maurice heads upstairs sure that his short dj career is already paying off big time
maurice slips into the darkness of the room and closes the door behind him
time for a little meat beat manifesto
in the darkness he cant see where she is
just hear a deep breathing almost panting
ahhh tantric breathing
im in love
he cant see her
or anything in the dark room
finally his eyes adapt to the dark and he sees a dark shape by the bed
thats it honey
dont need to speak
jesuis le gangsta de lamour
el gaucho della cosmos
we will speak zee international language of love
he pulls out a lighter to light his joint and see where she is but when he does its not her beautiful dark features he sees but for the blink
of an eye its totally blank face except for a huge mouth with liver lips pink gums and wolfen teeth
when it exhales out comes a noxious cloud of tiny insects
and then in the blink its the raging black dog leaping open jawed at his face
maurice screams and drops his light in fright
he starts crawling towards the door and the overhead light switch
while trying to fend himself from the wailing teeth and claws of the canine creature
maurices screams are inaudible
just another faint part of the complicated mix
maurices voice a sample loop is part of the boys mix
voice in music mix jimmy bones is in the house
furious flashes and glimpses of savage teeth and claws ripping maurice
bills extended turntablism rocks the house
tia replaces patrick behind the bar while cinnabar drags him on to the dance floor
bones vision moves floats all the way down to the basement
he squats over his own corpse
before our eyes intercut with flashes of the demon dog feasting on maurice upstairs more and more flesh grows on the bones of bones
bill signals patrick calling him over
wheres the gangsta of love
probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner
well go find his lazy ass
i scratch any more tonight im gonna have carpal tunnel syndrome
this portion of the screenplay contains scenes that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie
in order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay it has not been edited
patrick walks upstairs we fear he will be next
where are you
he tries a door
then he hears noises from the third floor
patrick opens the remaining bedroom door on a nightmare tableaux
maurice lies in a pool of blood
his body shakes and shudders spasmodically as the dog feasts on his liver
patrick starts for maurice but the dog growls to keep him back away from its precious food
patrick backs up a step
almost out of his mind with terror
he really loses it when the dog in slo mo looks up and directly at him
it seems to be wearing maurices face and speaks with a twisted version of his maurices voice the gangsta of love dont eat no fried chicken
and before patrick can even freak the dog has returned to its normal dog face and it lunges at patrick taking a sizeable bite out of his arm
patrick leaps back out the door with only a fast glance back at the thing in the room the dog is not following him
over maurices remains
growling low it begins to shudder uncontrollably to bulge and ooze
the gore covered dog quivers and swells and bulges and finally explodes into a shower of pulsating maggots flying all over the room and all over patricks eyes and in
the body is now done
it looks whole again
even strong and young
if still gray and cold until bones lies down curls up into the body filling the rejuvenated corpse with the vital life force of his vengeful rage
bones the body opens his eyes stands up not tottering as before but filled with strength
he looks as good as new except for the tattered clothes
the dancers cant hear patrick screaming or running down the stairs
theyre just groovin along to ill bill and the funk
until the maggots start oozing and pouring through the ceiling onto their hair and faces and clothes into their drinks at the bar and onto their pizza slices
then patrick comes into the room screaming and all hell breaks loose as the sight of him plus the maggots sends everyone tearing for the exits
seeing his brother in terror bill slams the tone arm screeching the needle across the record leaving only the psycho drum and bass playing on the other channels of the
meanwhile down below the freshly embodied bones studies the gas furnace
this time when he bends down to blow out the light wooosh he blows it out
he reaches under the tank and the gas hisses out
then he eyes his old razor on the floor
with a confident strong grip he picks it up and now finally hell maggots still falling onto people maggots on the floor making people slip and fall as they jam
screaming chaos people trying to break windows to get out faster
patrick looks across the chaotic room and sees cinnabar and tia cringing under a table
bill in the doorway trying to get people out
at the top of the stairs leading up out of the sub basement bones smashes the bulb of the hanging light
then flips the light switch the spark ignites the gas behind him
it causes a fiery explosion in the lower basement
the fires light seems the very glow of hellfire behind bones as he marches up the stairs razor in his hand
patrick trying to stay low crawls his way to where his sister and cinnabar are trapped
fire begins to burn through from the kitchen and up through the floor
the room is filling with smoke
bills helping those trampled in the rush to get out
bill himself bleeds badly from his neck
patrick runs with cinnabar and tia toward the door
and as the smoke fills the room through the haze we see bones step into the room
his arm raised with the razor
and he flings it out like a boomerang the razor flies around the room
it swoops down through the smoke at the remaining kids hacking at them through the smoke like some savage bird though it doesnt seem intent on slaughtering them but rather
herding them out
bill and patrick pull cinnabar and tia out the door theyre the last in the room
suddenly the razor stops freezes in mid air and zips back into bones waiting fist just like a boomerang
razor held high bones advances on them steadily cool as ice amidst the now fully burning house
shotgun pearl and a few others have run out into the street to watch the fire
in the distance sirens already wail
pearl holds her breath until she sees cinnabar safe
looking for an instant they all see bones as the room is engulfed in flames
see him raise his fists in a rage
or is it in triumph
before his figure is obscured by falling debris
sirens wail as fire trucks pull up and the men start unrolling a hose
but freeze at the cocking of the shotgun
let it burn
the rising flames illuminate the faces of spectators
especially shotgun and pearl who for the first time in years look each other straight in the eyes
we shoulda done this a long time ago
i dont know
her flame reflecting eyes telling us her fear this may be a huge mistake
in the burning room we see bones oblivious to the flames climbing the stairs
he comes to whats left of maurice
finds his hand bloodied and barely attached to the wrist and on it bones ring
you wont be needing this
bones slips it onto his stump of a finger
patrick and the others sit ashen faced under questioning by cops and arson investigators
flying razor big black man spontaneous explosion
i got just one question what the hell narcotic were you all on
we never did that
maurice was into it
thats the one you left behind
my man maurice
the space cowboy
the gangsta of love
he breaks down
just then jeremiah walks in with a lawyer
none of you say another word
cinnabar is crying pearl holding her
its alright baby
who was he momma
he tried to kill us
if he was trying to kill you youd be dead
who is he
what is he
he was your father
jeremiah drives his still shocked and silent brood back to safety behind the gates of rossmore park
i dont want any of you ever back down there again
you hear me
and this time youll listen to me
or ill let them throw your asses in jail
i mean it
cinnabar listening to her mother is told what happened
you got his hands
i didnt even know
when they we killed him that you were already alive inside me
lifes like that
grows right out of death
but if its him
if hes really come back wont he know us
sure if it was really him
but it isnt that simple
jimmys body died a long time ago
and his soul is long gone and all thats left is that ravening hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself i suppose
but how do you know
maybe he just wanted to see us
and now hes gone again
and youve all killed my father for the second time
cinnabar runs crying out of the room
this portion of the screenplay contains scenes that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie
in order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay it has not been edited
the building is finished just a blackened shell
remnants of the staircase lead up to fragments of the upper floors
smoke still billowing from the empty center of the ruin
silhouetted in the smoke and the low light of the rising sun a tall dark figure not of then nor quite of now
it is bones
taller thinner darker and more menacing then ever
but unmistakably bones
he steps out of the rubble
and looks across the street up at shotguns lit window
shotguns hand shakes as he pours another shot
then downs it
he turns to the window and freezes at what he sees
bones face is just outside the window
the second story window
smiling in at him
shotgun is petrified
but then he picks up his gun and shoots at the face in the window
free at last free at last
shotgun whirls and there stands bones behind him now
it wasnt my fault
i didnt know what theyd planned
it dont matter now
i was on your side
dont you remember
he just walks towards the terrified shotgun closer and closer leaning right over his shotgun his face coming just inches from shotguns face
take a look at what i remember brother
his big brown eyes fill shotguns vision and in what now seem to be the gigantic pupils in bones eyes shotgun sees the old apartment and there it all is
again and again
shotgun sees himself hesitating almost risking it all and instead giving in stabbing bones he cant look away
then bones closes his eyes
shotgun sobbing now
i had no choice jimmy
what else could i do
you coulda died with me
shotgun is cradling his weapon hands shaking
he points it at bones and pulls the trigger
bones doesnt even flinch as the pellets rip through him
bones impossibly long fingers hold his long rusty razor
he waves the razor in front of shotgun the rusty blade swinging free back and forth hypnotically with a rasping sound
you gonna be free and clear shotgun
all debts paid
and then in one swift motion on the back stroke bones hand and razor slash across shotguns throat
shotgun doesnt even have time to scream we just hear his breath and blood escaping from the new opening across his neck
bones bends down and cradling his old friend whispers gently into his ear
we cant quite hear
see you on the other side brother
bones gets up and moves around the room standing before the window and looking down at the neighborhood he used to own
for a second he sees the old neighborhood everybody hanging out
then he blinks back to reality
he looks down the block and sees pearls reader and advisor sign
bill in a kind of shock can only lie in his bedroom staring at the ceiling
tias out in the living room sitting on the couch weeping in her mothers arms
patricks in the bathroom tending the bloody scratches on his back and arms
he storms out of the bathroom down the hall to his fathers office
as patrick slams the door behind him jeremiah hides a stack of papers and photos beneath a pile on his desk
did you do it
i went down there and torched the place myself
you could have had it done
you didnt want us there
i wouldnt have risked killing you to get you out
i was trying to protect you
jeremiah cant answer
but patricks not leaving it alone
why did you give a shit about the building
why did you care that we were there of all places
its a bad neighborhood
as you can see now
dont front me
just tell me the truth
i came from there too
you were just a kid
i saw your face
you knew that place
you knew those people
thats the past
i dont think your past is dead
points to the bandages its alive
and it bites
that night we see a walking shadow
the long tall black clad bones
heading down his old block
as he moves his face changes at times demonic and intent
but periodically that shifts as if a mask slipping off to reveal a similar but different face below
more human lost pained confused and we see why the dark and desolate street he walks down keeps flashing for brief instants into the street of twenty years ago
one moment people nodding to him waving blowing kisses
and then suddenly its the empty burnt block it is now
bones face shifts cracking one second the hungry ghost
the next hes the old bones who once ruled this hood
he sees down the block the old palmistry sign
its pearls place
for a second the face of the real jimmy bones triumphs and he smiles
then hears voices behind him
stank and weaze
they see a tall thin figure in some very fine looking long duster
looking to score
unh unh little brother
i got a natural high
a supernatural high
hey eddie mack dont like no wackos on his street
go be rain man on some other bitchs block
sorta singing big bad eddie mack
got shit for brains and thats a fack
but he got a baaaad coat
whataya say bro
i check out your coat
here it is
suddenly out from the depths of his shadow flies the edge of bones razor and the blade slashes stank in the face
cutting a sideways smart aleck smile in his cheek
weaze pulls a gun and shoots bones
bones jolts a little as the bullet imbeds itself in his stomach
but he takes it like a punch and looks up
cut that shit out
he grabs one of the boys in each long hand and hoists them up to his height and pins them against the wall
you tell my old friend mackie ill be seeing him
wh wh whooo

pearl sits alone drinking
maybe crying a little
her hands shuffle large tarot cards
she lays her own spread
first card face down
second card face up
and across it the third is laid the crumbling tower
then she slips the first card the down turned card out and flips it face up
suddenly a long black shadow falls over the table
without looking up welcome back lover
she finally looks up at him
not so bad
youre not quite him
but youre not the shaggy demon i expected neither
his face quivers and we see from his pov pearl then and now
again then and now
you look confused
the dead often are
course so are the living
i been confused a long time
least twenty years
maybe if i hadnta walked in at that moment
or maybe if i hadnta let you go at all
i figure one way or the other i killed you
so its only fair kill me lover
i dont mind
ill even help you
the way you helped me
she grabs his hand tries to stab herself with his razor
but he resists
pulls his arm free
that mean theres something more left of you than just that hungry spirit
what are you going to do now
kill us all
you i forgive
she hurls herself at him
slamming her fists against his shadowy chest
the hell with you jimmy
cause i dont forgive you i dont forgive you for dying
and for being so goddamn stubborn
or for haunting my dreams
and i dont forgive you for anything youre about to do
he looks down at her
his face wavering between the true face of jimmy bones and the angry bones ready to kill her
then he wraps his arms around her and they kiss
she faints the cards in her fist fluttering to the floor
he lays her gently down
when suddenly cinnabar throws the door open
she and bones make eye contact
she sets eyes for the first time on the father shes never known
and in the blink of her eye hes gone
she runs to where her mom lies on the floor
stank and weaze with eddie mack whos getting a manicure from a coke whore
you boys been hitting the pipe
its just that i dunno
he was tall and thin and like a shadow his face was just a blur
all i remember is the voice
it was smooth and low and it didnt seem to be comin out of his mouth
then howd you hear it fool
it was just like in my head
maybe i oughta open a couple holes in that head and let all them voices out
youll feel better i promise
no eddie man
but hes not about to shoot him
he leans over and snorts a line of white powder off the mirrored tray
i told you not to lie to me
now what the hell happened
needs a hit what about me baby
now what he just said to tell you what
he was back
who was back
at the very sound of the name mack freezes
then with sudden coke fueled ferocity he whips around and starts smacking the shit out of stank breaking his nose
the coke whore cheering eddie on
wanting to see more action
what the fuck is that supposed to mean
get the fuck out of here
both of you fore you hear my voice up in yo head
cinnabar pours some bourbon into a coke for her mother
but pearl just grabs the bottle and takes a straight hit
hell kill them
hell kill every last one of them
eddie mack that cop
and even when hes done who knows
he wont be satisfied
just like that demon dog
feed it and it just grows hungrier
feed his hunger for revenge he just wants more
who knows where itll stop
that kind of hunger aint never satisfied
arent you gonna do something about it
i got a little power sure
a touch of the shining a little of the sight
but no more than you do
were not witches
i cant wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away
besides maybe they deserve it
maybe we all do
and his brother and sister dont
and theyre in the house with him
long beat fine
maybe i got nothing to lose
the lights are low and only the glow of the jukebox and the sounds of harold melvin and the bluenotes as mack and his manicurist get down on the pooltable
beside an ornate mirror laden with two gold s and an ounce of cocaine
which they are both doing to excess
macks wearing nothing but a black hat and black satin briefs not a pretty sight
working now on her blouse
bones my ass
sings while unbuttoning the manicurists blouse
if you dont believe hes laid to rest you count the holes in his motherfucking chest
she laughs and gets up
i want to hear that again
he watches her sashay to the other room where the juke box is
then bends over the mirror to do a new line
from the other room the song changes
a deep menacing rolling funk number
thats it baby
gimme the rolling bass and ill tickle your tweeter all night long
babys standing wide eyed next to the jukebox staring at bones his razor pressed against her quivering lips
macks wondering where she is
he walks doing a little funky rufus thomas shuffle to the music
he steps into the club room
its dark lit only by the jukebox
but its empty
nobody walks out on eddie mack
then he sees something
her legs on the floor sticking out behind the jukebox
he walks towards her slowly
then sees the deepening pool of blood pouring across the floor right towards him
whatever happened to her shes beyond his help now
he whips around but cant see anyone
he strides defiantly back into the pool room
i take you all on
mack picks up the two gold plated revolvers off the mirror with coke on it
suddenly all the coke moves on its own
the many grams piled there all merge into one pile
he bends down to check it out
and the coke actually flies straight up off the mirror with the force of a punch and shoots like a fire hose straight up his nose
he reels back choking
after having probably an ounce fly straight up his snot locker
blood pouring out his nose
he hears a low echoing laughter through the club and the sound of the cue ball breaking and sending pool balls spinning round the table
bones stands by the pool table under the overhanging light
he pulls out his razor and with one savage slice splinters the pool cue in two
i killed you and i stuck your dead ass in a hole in the ground wrapped in nothing but your bitchs bloody rags
now ill count the holes in your muthafuckin chest
and ill add a few more
he fires both guns at bones while backing away
bones dont feel a thing
he just picks up the mirror and holds it up facing mack
your big ass tidal wave
mack sees his own terrified face staring back from the mirror belling hanging over his briefs coke and blood clotted on his face
look like the waves long gone and nothing but oil scum dead fish and yo ugly ass left on the beach
mack shoots wildly at bones
at the mirror blasting it into shards
but bones stands unscathed
and the shards of broken mirror do not fall to the ground
they remain in the air forming a living room swarm of razor sharp glass
mack turns and runs waaaaay too fucking late as the swarm of glass shards fly like angry wasps right at him eddies thrown forward by the sheer force of them
and is skewered throughout his body by all the glass fragments
pinned face mashed against the wall
macks voice im taking a five dollar kick in the head thats a quick ticket to heaven
mack pinned to the wall
bleeding from everywhere
snot blood coke mess drips out his nose
bones pulls macks head back by his hair and slides his razor into the half inch between his adams apple and the wall
as the juke box changes song we hear a liquid slice and a scream slip into a gurgle
bones long hands drip blood as he ties something to his belt
we dont quite see what it is not until we catch the sight of eddie macks headless remains pinned to the wall
lupovich is at his desk finishing off a huge polish sausage
talking on the phone
a cop named sal is nearby tidying up
i know it
the old slaughterhouse
hangs up hey sal
that little weasel we popped today
hes got something for us
i knew he would once he thought about it
shit that was fast
they scare easy
anyway hes gonna tip their stash
come with me
im on my way home
can you handle it yourself
please dont make me go by myself
see you tomorrow
bones walks the night with a slicing stride
his legs stretching too far and somehow covering long distance in an instant
and in slo motion like a nightmare marionette a walking shadow or some great black grasshopper
as if swinging back and forth bones
bones you muthafuckah
what the hell you done to me
bones stops for a moment and looks down at his waist and we see macks severed head tied to bones belt
severed yet seemingly alive
not half what im planning on
this some sick fucked up shit
what you want with my head
just using it to carry your soul
look i killed you
you killed me
bones got no time to argue
he bends and picks up a handful of fetid city garbage
no need to get all meta fucking phys i gack
and shoves it into the still talking mouth of mack
bright loud summer night
blues coming from inside a blues bar the guy playing killin floor
lupovich heads toward the armor building
from a distance he sees a young runner emerge from a passage on the farside of the building then set off to meet his mark
lupovich heads for the passage the music following him
lupovich looks around to make sure no one is watching
then slips into a passageway leading to the old slaughterhouse
a scary walk through inky darkness scattered with broken glass and scurrying rats and lit only by the eerie red light spilling like blood out of the open door into
the old slaughterhouse at the end of the way
lupovich reaches the back right next to the old loading dock where the still livestock were unloaded
he enters the door disappearing into the red darkness
the room large and open soaked in the sodium vapor that streams through the tall windows from the streetlights
there are a few blood rusted meat hooks still there backlit hanging from the ceiling
graffiti covers the walls with arcane tags and symbols
the floors are caked with a sticky grime turned black in the orange haze
in the far corner burn three red votive candles
behind the candles lies a crumpled brown paper bag
lupovich starts over to the corner twitching at the gross sound of his shoes sticking to the layers of old coagulated blood on the killing floor
behind him framed for an instant int he doorway a tall sharp shadow a walking razor bones
the walk is tense
somehow the music has followed him here and is echoing and wailing in the walls around him
he gets to the corner and reaching over the candles opens the top of the paper bag
five ziplocks of the rocks
he hears a noise
lupovich fumbles for his gun and at the same time reaches to snatch the stash bag
his wrist touches the candles flame and it burns
he hears another noise a blade scraping on concrete right behind him
now the music blends with the echoing squeals of the hogs once butchered on the cutting line
lupovich hears another noise a blade scraping on concrete right behind him
now the music blends with the echoing squeals of the hogs once butchered on the cutting line
lupovich turns and there towering over him stands bones
and just as startling theres macks laughing severed head swinging from his belt
lupovich can only choke on his terror and while his mouth is open bones shoves a glass pipe into it
brandishing his razor bones packs a rock into the bowl and torches it
he holds the razor to lupovichs throat
in macks voice just try it
it wont kill you
lupovich trembling takes a massive hit of the crack deep into his lungs
the music and the sounds of the dying pigs attack him as the coke fills his lungs and then his blood and then his brain his eyes starting to bug
bones then knocks the pipe from his lips and seals his hand over lupovichs mouth and nose
he cant exhale
the sounds get louder the grafted walls come alive
bones removes his hand revealing lupovichs nose is fused shut and his mouth is simply gone the skin flat where the mouth used to be
lupovichs gotta lung full of crack and no way to exhale
severed mack laughs insanely as he sees lupovichs eyes bulge as his lungs start to strain under the agony
his frenzied suffocation is nothing but pure torture
while he is still kicking with the fear and the drug rush bones drags lupovich to the middle of the room
with one arm bones lifts the fat cop up and hooks him to one of the meat hooks above
in lupovichs voice i aint gonna be the only one with this niggers blood on my hands
as lupovich squirms bones takes his blade and shoves it in just below lupovichs sternum
and a spray of blood paints bones and macks hanging head
thick crack smoke emerges from the wound and floats foglike out of the chest cavity
bones then yanks the blade southward and slices the cops belly wide open
we hear lupovichs guts spill out on the floor
was that really necessary
can you wipe my fucking face
i cant see a goddamned thing
the dope smoke wafts in the room four feet off the floor
the song immolates itself
and bones adds another weight to his belt
just round the corner from the entrance to the gated suburb
cinnabar and pearl
well have to sneak in
no we wont momma
ill just have them call and tell patrick its us
girl they build gates like that to keep people like us out
cinnabar walks up to the guard at the gate
he picks up the phone to check
patrick grabs it
but his fathers already on the other end
on phone a young lady to see you
a miss vaughn
send her away
the rent a cop hangs up the phone and shakes his head
cant i call
and talk to them
but not from here
nearest public phone would be back a few miles
outside the mall
cinnabar sees its useless to argue and walks away
shocked and hurt
back to where her mother stands in the shadows outside the gates
told you so
lets go home
hear a voice from the other side of the gate
walk around the north side
theres an opening there
as they sneak around the other side a dark figure steps right up to the main gates
the rent a cop wakes up fast when he sees bones standing in front of him
after all how often does he come face to face with everything he is there to keep out
he hitches his belt in best john wayne style
can i help y but then he notices the two severed heads swinging from bones belt
all three of them smile
can jeremiah come out and play
the other outer edge of the sub development
patrick leads them in through some bushes and behind some of the pipe and power systems of the subdivision
why couldnt you just tell him to let us in
my old man calls the shots
he built that gate and these damn walls
to cinnabar you sure we oughta save him
why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling
what are you talking about
jeremiah locks the door to his study
then he pulls out the stack he hid on his desk
a dusty manila envelope
inside photos the old days
his first wife
his first life
back in the old neighborhood
him and his best friend jimmy bones as children teenagers and as adults
what it is
and bones stands right behind him
severed heads hanging from his belt
what it will be
how did you get in here
time like this is that what you really want to know
how i got the fuck in here
a car drives up to the gate
but no guard comes out to check it out
the driver of the car honks
but no response
just the aimless squawk of the radio in the booth
cant really see into the tooth
the windows are splattered and obscured by deep red stains
patrick runs in with cinnabar and pearl past a startled nancy
whore your friends
but they run right past
though pearl gives a kind of half wave hi hello
patrick runs down the hall to his fathers study
the doors locked
from the inside he pounds on it
bill and tia stick their heads out to see what all the racket is
we got to get in there
bill and patrick slam against the door
finally it gives way and they both tumble through the broken door into the room
but its empty
jeremiahs not there
a strange greenish fog up and down the street emanating from the burnt out shell of the building
high in the center where the master bedroom once was we see a kind of mirage forming
another image of the room still there vaguely luminescent in the night
theyre in shock
we cant go back there
are you crazy
you saw its the only way
its possible your father may not be dead yet
they look around at the mess in the room
over turned chair
signs of struggle
spatters of blood
your father was his best friend
he loved jeremiah
so he must hate him the most of all now
hell take his time
but even if it is too late
if your father is dead
its not over
the door has to be closed
well close the fucking door by all means
but dont expect me to go down there and do it
she gets up to go
cinnabar stands too
you aint going down there
but im bringing a couple of friends
he steps out of the room and comes back with a gun and a knife in a sheath on his belt
they wont do you no good
bill with a defiant well it cant hurt look
nancy appears in the doorway as they hurry out seeing bill with the gun in his hand
what are you doing
ive just called the police and
then we need to get out of here
we cant try to explain this to them
well be back
hopefully with dad
nancy clings to tia as the rest of them hurry down the hall
this portion of the screenplay contains scenes that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie
in order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay it has not been edited
it is bones old bedroom
the necropolois version
the floor the walls the furniture everything in it formed out of the wracked and twisted shapes of dead souls
this is that same version of the room weve glimpsed before
and it remains even when the real room has burnt away
bones there in the flesh with jeremiah on his knees
bones untying the heads from his belt
you two bitches were just meat never had any idea smarter than getting yourself a little more
but my brother jaybird here
he was smart
he didnt just want more
he wanted more with compound interest
bones shoves the screaming severed heads through the undead wall of the necropolis
for only a flashcut moment we see the heads see coming at them reaching for them
laughing at them
time for him to collect his interest
jeremiahs gonna have the unique experience of seeing his reward tasting it while hes still alive
bones wraps his long arm around jeremiahs neck in a brotherly choke hold
pearl cinnabar bill and patrick speed south by car
see there aint just two parts to a person
body soul and spirit
the spirit lives in the blood
its the wanting that holds body and soul together and sometimes the wanting lives on
jimmys blood must still be in the house
but the place burned to the ground
the blood is still there
we just gotta figure out where
in his grave there was a cloth or a dress or something
covered with blood
we have to find it
and burn it
and shut the door
bill and patrick look at pearl like she might be crazy
then they see cinnabar next to her glaring back at them
bones has jeremiah on his feet now leading him towards the wall of the undead
suddenly hands shoot out of the wall only inches away from jeremiahs face
he twists and turns to stay away from them but the long nails on one of the hands claw at his cheek
while hungry mouths open from the palms of hands
keeping jeremiah out from hands reach i dont understand it
you were my man
since we was grasshoppas
i always looked after you
you had a piece of everything i had
i didnt want a piece of yours i wanted my own
and the hell everybody else right
bones pushing jeremiahs face towards the grasping hands
think about it
you woulda done the same thing if you was me
i never done a man any man
let alone a brother like that
course as you can see no good deed goes unfucked
now the question is if the good get fucked what we got saved up for the bad
you about to find out
bones rams jeremiahs head his eyes closed in fear through the necropolis wall
jeremiahs head inside now
eyes still closed head bobbing in the jelly like base that holds what he sees when he dares to open his eyes
hideous malformed faces genetic anomalies the kinds of faces that wound up in side shows in less enlightened times
all laughing and leering and glaring at jeremiah
the skin peeling away like congealed jelly
lupovich tries to talk to jeremiah or to scream but nothing comes out
except for a hideous wobbling bubble
for a subliminal moment jeremiah sees a figure trapped inside the bubble
his own figure silently screaming to get out
suddenly jeremiah is screaming for real as bones has just yanked his head back out of the wall
its a trip aint it
bones sounding almost sympathetic to jeremiah
this portion of the screenplay contains scenes that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie
in order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay it has not been edited
suddenly as they round a corner onto blackstone they see tendrils of an eerie greenish fog
it seems to be emanating from the still smoking remains of bones house
or perhaps it is just the smoke tinged only by the gaseous street lights
weve got to hurry
weve got to shut the door
theyre getting out
then theres a shape and a thump
the real terror of thinking your car just hit a human being
then a face appears in the car window
just a homeless guy shaking an angry fist at them
quickly hes gone in the fog
straining to see patrick stops grabbing a flashlight from his glove box
they all get out
making their way through the fog glimpsing in darkened doorways eerie shapes perhaps more of the dead out of necropolis
they arrive at the back side of the ruined building
there was a storm door to the cellar
they search frantically in the dark amongst the tall weeds abandoned junk and burnt rubble
jeremiah still with bones looking for a way out
what will it take
what do you want
just tell me jimmy
aw thats easy
i want my life back
can you swing that my brother
you know i cant
then fuck it
in a righteous fury bones headlocks jeremiah again and rams his head through the necropolis wall
as hes back inside face to face with living dead mutations with lupovichs head coming at him its mouth suddenly opening to ten times its normal size swallowing jeremiah whole
watching with some pity as the rest of jeremiah his legs and feet are pulled into the wall and gone
accompanied by the disappearing screams of the last of jeremiah
sadly dog eat dog brother
dog eat dog
they search for the cellar door
the night air is shattered by a scream at once very close and infinitely far
hes found a chipped gray storm door
patrick easily kicks in the rotten wood revealing a dark tunnel of stairs leading down beneath the ruins of the building into the sub basement
its not safe down there
the fire started down there
the whole thing could collapse
then your fathers a dead man and jimmy bones is gonna be around a long time
patrick steps down into the darkness of the cellar his flashlight on
the group stoops low as they descend the stairs
beneath wood supports the dirt is reclaiming it already a constant trickle of dirty falling from between the boards
in the dim patrick leads them walking through a mass of spider infested webs and just ahead is the sub basement where they originally found the body
throwing debris aside they come next through a small door at the bottom of the stairs and enter the sub basement
nearby is the elevator shaft a gaping hole in the ruins but recognizable as such
the ceiling above them is nearly collapsed and over most of the room the accumulated debris and ruin from above has simply fallen through
and what remains of the ceiling is still shifting groaning coming apart
patrick shines his flashlight down to the ground until here
hes found the hole that was bones hastily dug grave but theres nothing in it now but swarming white maggots
is it there
she gets down on her hands and knees as patrick shines the light but after a few frantic moments of digging its clear its gone
he got it
just then the sound of tremendous strain and creaking of wood
and the ceiling starts to give way
they all scramble for shelter and then it gives way completely completely blocking their way out
they all look in every direction for some glimpse of hope of a way out
there is none
then they hear behind them a resonant ding
where moments before there was a gaping ruined elevator shaft there is now a fully functioning elevator just as it was in the doors opening to them in eerie slo
pearl starts towards the open car
the others trying to hold her back
she walks closer peering into the dark recesses of the elevator
maybe again a flash of visible movement inside
closer ever closer until pearl almost entranced steps in
and once inside theres no one or no thing there
pearl is about to tell them its okay
when suddenly the doors of the elevator slide slam shut
then they hear the elevator chain start to move and the elevator starts to rise
cinnabar screaming louder
pearl stands there summoning all her courage for what she knows shes going to have to face
watching the elevator arrow as it climbs to the number three
patrick and bill beat on the door and try to pry it open
then they try jamming jagged boards into the opening but still to no avail
as a moment later the car stops and the doors open onto down to the last detail exactly as it was years ago the night bones died
music playing the delfonics didnt i blow your mind this time
the only new detail are the dozens of candles romantically burning everywhere
pearl feels a soft touch on the back of her neck and spins finds jimmy right behind almost nuzzling her
his face hidden though in darkness
holding something in his hand behind his back
still with her back to him jimmy youve got ive got what i want
turn around baby look at me
look at your man
she turns slowly and we dont know what to expect
something horrible or something beautiful
finally shes face to face and its jimmy just as he was years ago
all traces of the demonic are gone
pearl melts as the delfonics swell jimmy holding her close
i want you to do something for me baby
we see what hes holding the dress
rotted and blood clotted and ruined
i always loved you in this dress
he holds it up for pearl to see and from the dress is brand new and beautiful
shes finally entranced
patrick bill and cinnabar have managed now to pry open the elevators outer doors
they step inside on the soft ashen ground and look up the shaft goes all the way into eternity
but along the tacked walls they see hand and footholds put there for workers
we can climb out
climb out to where
anywhere but here
one by one they start to climb bill first
as they climb they become aware of light on the first floor level just ahead
pearl steps into the frame to look at herself in a floor length mirror on bones closest door
not only the dress but she too looks exactly as she was years ago skin smooth as cocoa butter eyes free from worry and pain
roberta flacks killing me softly as jimmy takes her in his arms and starts to slow dance her in the midst of all those candles
where are we baby
where well always be
pulls her closer closer until her last misgivings are gone
whatever purpose she came with lost in the power of having the impossible
the three still climbing handhold by handhold knocking loose dirt in each others eyes
bill is just now reaching the first floor level trying to force open the outer doors
suddenly an ominous sound the chain mechanism of the elevator as they see it starting to descend towards them
panicking bill tries with all his might
as the elevator inches closer and closer until bill finally manages to get the doors open
they all scramble to safety just as the elevator slides by them
after they catch their breath they look up and around to find themselves a distorted m
escher like feel to the place
where up seems to be down down up and left is right
not helped by behind only lit by the eerie flickering gaseous lamps outside and the moonlight falling through the skylight
then slowly through the gloom they begin to perceive that the walls are clotted and congealed teratomic masses of distorted flesh faces limbs eyes mouths all trapped all contorted in
at first they seem to be frozen in the walls like the ruins of herculaneum
but then we see they are slowly writhing moving
hands grasping teeth and rotted jaws widening and worst of all the eyes staring out
is this hell
gripping the gun or just hell adjacent
aint no heaven
aint no hell
theres just the world of the dead my momma always talked about
like she said the door is open and were seeing right through our world into this one
we just have to remember what was really here
and follow it
those stairs should take us to the second floor
as they approach the stairs they can hear faintly above the drone moan of the dead the soft music playing in bones crib
they start up the stairs into the darkness
patrick first cinnabar in between him and bill
patrick still holding his flashlight but its starting to flicker a little
more of the same horror along the stairway walls eyes looking at them hands caress cinnabars hair another hand shooting up from the stair floor and grabbing bills thigh
bill stabs the hand with the knife on his belt
and the hands shoot back down
the munch like dance of death goes on bones stroking the back of her neck
just like i told you this morning id be stroking your neck tonight
pearl absolutely lost
the three still ascending when patricks flashlight suddenly cuts out
a faint sound patrick shaking the flashlight
nothing but the sound of breathing both human and non human
thing worked fine a minute ago
batteries were brand new then as suddenly as it went out the flashlight comes back on illuminating a horrible sight maurice
standing right there a few feet in front of them
maurice puts a finger to his lips and beckons them to follow
the boys want it to be maurice
but cinnabar knows better
thats not maurice but with the beam of the flickering flashlight they follow the shadowy figure up the steps
then maurice gets a bit to far ahead and they cant see him for a beat
hold up man
then after a silent beat just maurices hand appears back out of the darkness beckoning them onward
then the flashlight cuts out again
theyre back in the darkness
as he shakes the flashlight okay were on the second floor
i feel it
no more steps
the sound of patrick cursing and shaking the batteries around in the torch
eventually it comes on again
up ahead they still barely see maurice his back to them face in one quarter profile leading them towards the next flight of stairs at the end of the hall
closer and closer to the stairs maurice going eerily in and out of their vision
the flashlight dies again
patrick shakes it and it comes back quickly
then just as quickly dies again
a shake and its lit again just as bill is stepping into the corner where maurice disappeared
as the dog leaps at them from the corner all teeth and slavering jaws
everyone scrambles for their lives and the flashlight falls to the floor
we see the skewed horror as the dog tears at bill as his gun skitters across the floor as patrick grabs the gun and fires and we get a bit
more illumination from the exploding gunpowder
but it does no good
bill screams in terror as hes torn to pieces and then the flashlight goes out and again were in stygian darkness
the sound of bill dying and a long silence
finally in husky voice im here
listen from somewhere comes the sound of the music from bones crib
here find my hand
the stairs are right near here
i saw them
lets just walk up there
i cant find you
as we expect the worse expect something else to take her hand
but then is that you
pause the music from bones crib still beckons to them
dont let go
were in near total darkness as they climb the stairs maybe a bit of moonlight now coming in from the roofless third floor theyre approaching
all we can hear is their footsteps and their breathing as they walk the rest of the way up the stairs and emerge into both amazed to see pearl as
young and beautiful as cinnabar is clinging to the dashing jimmy dancing to the spectral sounds of some soul classic from back in the day
cinnabar entranced by the vision
pearl opens her dreaming eyes and sees them smiling and beckoning cinnabar to come join her
cinnabar begins to
patrick watches her until he hears something o
calling to him
it sounds a million miles away and yet right in his ear
and it sounds like jeremiah
this portion of the screenplay contains scenes that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie
in order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay it has not been edited
he turns and looks at the wall subtly surging from beneath the surface of the wall he sees flashes of faces and hands mouths twisted in torment
he moves to the wall drawn by the strange sight and the recurring sound
as if a million miles away patrick
its coming from within the wall
now while cinnabar is advancing towards her mother and father across the room patrick at the wall tries to place his ear near it in order to hear where the
voice is coming from
while cinnabar is now within bones reach
pearl steps back to allow jimmy to embrace cinnabar
welcome home baby girl
pearl watches as bones caresses his daughters cheek
patrick now close to the wall trying to hear the faint voice calling to him
suddenly something enormous presses out from the wall
patrick stumbles back as his fathers head and torso press out from the wall stretched in straining effort
im so sorry
but please help me
jeremiah or what hes become embedded into the wall his face stretched mouth huge and hollow eyes dripping bloody tears
patrick in anguish
i dont want to spend forever like this
jeremiahs arm reaches out from the wall grasping towards patrick who reaches out to his father when suddenly with frightening speed jeremiah grabs it and wrenches patrick to him pulling
patrick flush up against the wall even starting to suck him in to the wall
as patrick struggles and writhes and twists to get free from his fathers grasp he can see back across the room to the others
he sees the room as it really is he can see whats really happening
pearl not in a new dress but in a horrible tattered blood encrusted old dress standing next to a rotting cadaver thats stroking cinnabars cheek and holding her close
jeremiah pulling patrick into the wall into the necropolis itself
patrick though just as concerned with cinnabar as with himself yelling at her across the crib
but cinnabar doesnt even turn her head
she just steps into her fathers embrace
but pearl does seem to hear something
she looks back at patrick beneath the illusion of the room she sees him being pulled into the awful wall and can hear him more clearly now
slowly pearl turns and looks into the mirror and she gets a full length view of herself a woman in ruined tatters of her old rotted dress
then coming into her view in the mirror is her only daughter dancing with a decayed corpse
pearl whirls and rips cinnabar away from bones who at first sort of chuckles to himself
but he stops laughing when pearl grabs the nearest candle and presses the flame to her breast
in a terrible whoosh the dried old dress and pearl are engulfed in flames
bones runs to pearl and throws his arms around her trying to smother the flames any way he can
to patrick and cinnabar get out
cinnabar in a shattered daze on the floor sees her mother in flames
patrick desperately tries to escape his fathers death grip
finally with horrible sound patrick wrestles free from the wall and from his father
he lurches free from them and makes it over to cinnabar and drags her out the door just as the room dissolves around them
as the flames destroy the dress and the last vestiges of bones blood on it the room begins to turn to ash
an eerie wind from nowhere begins to howl blowing the ash and smoke from the dress and from the dissolving walls
cinnabar taking one last glance at the funeral pyre that was her mother and bones now too sees them almost lost in a shroud of flame and ash
patrick and cinnabar run down the corridor and back down the stairs the moon overhead and the flames from bones crib giving everything a flickering hellish cat
everything behind and above them crumbling to dust
the floor and then the stairs and all the howling bodies trapped inside
they reach the open elevator shaft
we gotta jump
everything around them rumbling and crumbling
we have to
patrick jumps and lands in the muddy ashes dazed but unhurt
he sees cinnabar peering over the edge in fear
then behind her he can hear a low rumbling growl
he sees cinnabar turn and scream ashes and falling debris then temporarily blind hen he wipes his eyes and looks up cinnabar is gone from view
where are you
he immediately climbs back up the shaft when he sees cinnabar standing at the edge of the shaft above him
and she jumps landing right next to patrick who quickly gets her to her feet
they run out of the shaft and into the sub basement just as the elevator and shaft dissolve into ash
a hurricane wind blowing down and out of the shaft now
mixed with the sound of all the screaming moaning souls in the necropolis
patrick in a fury to live tears away the boards and debris blocking the exit
he pulls cinnabar out with him and they walk up the cellar stairs step into the dawn weary beaten down but not dead
theyve made it out of the inferno
like dante said thus we emerged again to see the stars
no stars here just the glorious dawn
patrick stops feels the new sun on his face
breathes clean air again for the first time
we made it
then from behind or above or somewhere we can hear what might be a low low chuckle
jimmy bones chuckle
dog eat dog boy
dog eat dog
patrick turns and spins in mounting horror
there behind him right where cinnabar was standing
the black dog
it leaps right at the camera filling the frame with huge teeth and bloody red tongue
