predator dark horse prod
screenplay by peter briggs we open on total blackness a sea of stars spread across the infinite depths of space
as the titles roll we notice that three of these specks seem to be moving one of them picking up acceleration and racing toward us
our perspective changes and we catch a quick glimpse as it hurtles past and into the gravitational pull of a large brownish planet
kicking up sparks of friction as it hits atmosphere
it seems to be manmade
or at least artificial
the planet is dead barren
death valley on a grand scale
we watch the object plummet through the wispy cloud cover emitting a few last burning embers before falling to ground way off in the distance
a booming echo resonates across the dusty plains before settling back into an eerie silence
were looking into a deep gorge dark and sinister
a howling wind whips dust into a sandstorm reducing visibility to almost zero
about seventy feet down theres a hole in the rock face that just might be a cave entrance and near is a peculiar shimmering in the air
we hear a mechanical beeping and the shimmering disappears replaced by five humanoid shapes clinging to the sheer rock each well over seven feet tall
they are predators a race of intergalactic big game hunters on permanent safari their clothing and weaponry a bizarre mix of aborigine and ultra hi tech
in their hands are circular metal discs smart weapons which cut into the stone and give them purchase
from their p
we see the fissure reduced to thermal heat sources
the entrance registers as a black gaping void
the five hunters climb inside the rim of the tunnel out of the winds banshee wailing
the lead predator reaches up to his headgear pulling at the coupling pipes connecting it to a hidden breathing apparatus
he removes the helmet clips it to his rear utility pack and takes a deep breath of the air
a curious speckled pattern runs across his wide forehead marking him different to the others in addition one of the fangs of his mandibles has been sheared away
well call him broken tusk hes the leader of the hunting party
he reaches out a hand to caress the wall of the tunnel
several feet in from the rim it changes from rock to a textured biomechanical surface a swirling mass of disturbing shapes
he hurries forward in response to the gurgling hiss of one of his team who has found something
the other predator holds a telescopic spear up for scrutiny
skewered on the end is a shriveled form with eight spindly legs and a segmented tail its a facehugger the first stage of the deadly alien lifeform
broken tusk hisses a caution to his party they respond by pulling spears and elaborately shaped swords
several shoulder mounted plasma cannons slide up to firing position tracking with their owners helmets
thus armed they move cautiously ahead
taking no chances
one helmeted predator pauses scanning the area
he switches through a variety of different views infra red ultra violet enhanced motion tracking
hes so pre occupied with this task he totally fails to notice the skeletal alien loom up behind him emerging from the biomechanical growth on the floor
a barbed tail skewers the predator straight through the neck splashing luminous blood across his chestplate
a gargled death rattle issues from his throat the band of predators spinning around in time to see him being dragged below the ground
the band of extraterrestrial hunters have no time to come to his aid they themselves are set upon by a half dozen alien warriors
the carnage is swift and terrifying a blur of motion
steel blades and serrated biomechanical limbs scythe the air alive with the cries and hisses of both adversaries
one predator is pinned against the tunnel wall his spear out of range
the alien claws away his face mask and he finds himself dodging the aliens toothed tongue extended toward him with pile driver speed
he reaches down grasping the smart weapon hanging from his belt and brings it up in an arc that terminates at the aliens grinning face
the two are in such close proximity that the aliens acidic blood sprays across the predators head
while their technology seems to be resistant to it their bodies arent the viscous yellow liquid begins burning into the predators skin
he kicks the skeletal corpse away with a hideous piercing scream clawing at his seared face
it all seems to be over as quickly as it began there can be no question as to who were the victors
the predators stand amidst a sea of biomechanical limbs strewn around like a charnel house
as his companions begin to carefully decapitate the alien skulls broken tusk steps over the corpses to examine his fallen comrades
the first predator to be attacked was killed instantly he crosses to the other
what he finds causes him to react with pity and disgust
his fallen comrade is only just alive mandibles clicking frailly half his head burnt away
broken tusk watches the ailing predator slide a steel blade from its sheath and offer it to him
he takes it knowing what has to be done
rolling the knife quickly over the back of his hand the sort of elaborate trick seasoned green berets perform he plunges it downward into the fallen hunter
this unpleasant task accomplished broken tusk straightens up and activates his wrist computer
a dark shape blots out the light coming from the entrance a small predator shuttlecraft sleek and elegant
it hovers in the air with little more than a loud hum and extends a ramp
the surviving predators leap aboard carrying their trophies with the reserved silence of men returning from combat
one more thing need to be done
broken tusk bends down and flips a sequence of keys on the dead predators wrist
a countdown is displayed in some unknown character set accompanied by a high pitched beeping
he then turns and swiftly boards the craft which takes smoothly to the air its undergear retracting
a white hot fireball erupts out of the fissure the result of the predators suicide destruct mechanism
the shuttlecraft pulls quickly away disappearing into the clouds
a large spacecraft is suspended in orbit around the planet the predator mothership
the shuttle heads swiftly towards it
an airlock rumbles open and the predators file noisily into the motherships docking bay
an old predator crouched against a strut takes time out from carving something into a block of wood to briefly look up at them
like the predators themselves the ship is a curious mixture of old and new
an elaborate frieze written in alien script runs around the wall with racks of sophisticated equipment recessed into it
hatches lead off to various parts of the ship we see broken tusk carry his alien head off down one of them
the gallery seems to be more mechanical than the rest of the ship
broken tusk enters pausing next to a kind of readout device a cylindrical tube containing a substance similar to mercury which constantly changes its mass into shapes and alien text
he peers over the protective railing
what he sees is magnificent a captive queen alien the nucleus of the alien society fed by giant intravenous pipes
each of its limbs is tethered by straining clamps preventing any movement
to the rear its giant egg sac glows and throbs suspended by a jury rigged sling
a scanning mechanism hangs above the eggs the queen lays seemingly defying gravity
as each egg is scanned by a blue triangular beam similar to a predator gun sight it becomes translucent giving us a view of the pulsing facehugger inside
this done a manipulator are carefully loads several eggs onto a pallet which then sinks into a hatchway in the floor
its an assembly line of almost frightening mechanical efficiency
we see a pod ejected from the mothership rocketing away from the planet into deep space
the inference is obvious the predators are seeding worlds with aliens to hunt
the blue beam slides across one of the eggs and suddenly changes to red beeping rapidly
broken tusk sees the flowing display tank alter from a rotating simulation of an alien warrior skull to a representation of a queens head
the manipulator arm swiftly grasps the egg in question and moves it over to a protrusion on the floor
the causes the queen to go berserk straining at her bonds and shrieking ferociously
shes obviously been through this before and knows whats about to happen
the protrusionsplits open spilling out an intense white light an energy filled blast furnace
the manipulator claw opens the egg drops in and is no more
an orange light plays across a wall of skulls casting dark shadows into long empty orbs
broken tusk sprawls lizard like across a flat slab of rock in the center of the room inspecting his formidable arsenal of weaponry
satisfied he reaches out to run a finger across the jaw of his alien trophy in an almost erotic gesture
he regards it for a long moment as if coming to a decision of some kind before finally getting to his feet
the lights in the gallery are dimmer when broken tusk enters
he watches the cherry red beam of the gliding scanning mechanism lock onto one of the eggs then runs his hand in sequence over the control board
the manipulator arm swings over seizing the egg and loading it onto a waiting pallet
broken tusk points his finger at the queen and makes a guttural clicking sound from deep in his throat
the effect is not unlike that of a child firing an imaginary gun
as if reading broken tooths thoughts the queen lifts her crested head upwards and emits a venomous hiss of contempt
in center frame the planet sits still and green awash with nebulous clouds
a hulking metal form rolls right to left across our view sunlight glinting from its surface
its a rectangular satellite construction comprised of hundreds of communication dishes in a latticework of steel tubing
we hear filtered human voices o
imagine a world where every square mile is covered by a canopy of treetop foliage and youve just drawn yourself a picture of the planet ryushi
nestled amongst this lush rainforest is the yutani templin communications relay station
several inverted u shaped suspension cranes painted bright yellow look down over a collection of preassembled buildings and roadways raised above the swamp on platforms much like a truncated oil
a navigation beacon flashes intermittently from a tall gantry tower above while dominating the view is the sloping face of a communications array several storeyes high
off to one side of the platform is a gigantic many wheeled haulage vehicle
a flock of bird like creatures fly past
were in the dark womb of a split level command center alive with clusters of video readouts somewhat reminiscent of a futuristic air traffic control tower
on the upper tier a large circular holo display currently projects an image of the satellite we just saw
thin trailers of paper flutter gently in the current coming from the air conditioning ducks though beads of sweat still dot the foreheads of the people manning the consoled here
we move in on cassie dollander and rob parsons two monitoring technicians occupying a control bank
cassie listens carefully to something on her headset
ah negative on that request commercial freighter nan shan
ive already got an inbound on that approach pending a beacon fix
hold on my mark until i get back with some confirmation
rimward traffic control out
she thumbs a button and leans over to parsons
hows it looking
parsons worriedly shakes his head
thats the second time i ran it and it still reads the same
better tell the boss
parsons pulls out a coin
toss you for it
hiroko noguchi is sweating heavily a black forelock of hair falling across her oriental features
her eyes flicker warily from side to side as she holds the smooth length of the sword before her trying to assess from where the next attack will come
she doesnt have to wait long two ninja swordsmen drop to the floor in front of her striking without hesitation
she expertly avoid the blows parrying relentlessly
a persistent tone begins to intrude o
like a telephone ringing
she tries to ignore it but her concentration is clearly broken
a third swordsman appears from out of nowhere his sword swishing towards her chest
the blade plunges deep into her stomach emerging from her back
she glances down in annoyed disbelief
the swordsmen immediately flicker and disappear
she sheathes the sword with one precise movement and crosses the wooden paneled floor to her desk
mopping her face with a towel she thumbs a stud
the ringing tone stops the corporate logo on her flat screen desk panel replaced with a black girls face
onscreen something just came up on deep space tracking
what kind of something
onscreen easier if you come down and look
im on my way
an eight wheeled articulated crawler rolls noisily through the rain climbing an access ramp leading from the swamp to the outposts empty main street
a group of rhinos brown two horned quadrupeds indigenous to ryushi restlessly stir in their corral at its approach
the crawlers pneumatics hiss gently as it comes to a halt while somewhere off in the distance a dog barks
don kamen a lean man in his forties
climbs down from the cab mounted five feet above the ground and squints up at the main relay antenna
he adjusts the cowboy hat on his head against the drizzle and crosses the street towards one of the buildings ignoring a pepsi sign creaking in the gentle breeze
a glass paneled door swishes automatically open before him
kamen steps into the command center nodding familiarly to the duty personnel
a long haired labrador rushes up to kamen wagging its tail
her name is brewster
shes the base mascot
kamen reaches down and ruffles its fur
he climbs the few stairs to the monitoring tier pulling the french plaited hair of annie urioste an italian systems mechanic with her hands buried in a disassembled console
you didnt wipe your feet coming in
well its okay
you didnt tell me it was monsoon season going out
parsons looks up at kamen and grins
hey buenos dias cowboy
when dyou blow in
kamen places his hat on parsons head and thumps it down
just got back
urioste snorts yeah
were almost out of beer
ahh dont pay any attention to urioste
shes still pissed that noguchi wouldnt let her go off on your hunting trip
kamen pours himself a cup of coffee from a bubbling percolator
wasnt my trip i just did the driving
sides freezing my butt off out in the wet taking pot shots at the local wildlife isnt my idea of a good time either
he sips gingerly from the cup of scalding liquid
whered you leave them
camped out by the navi beacon out on linsons range
theyre making their own way back tomorrow
marsco went belly up on the dow jones
we got the network feed from gateway it was the top story on sixty seconds
biggest market crash since twenty four
kamen looks ill
i invested some money in them
you win some you loose some
i lose em all thats why im still out here on this rock
anything else you wanna ruin my day with
no but i got something that might interest you
hiroko enters pulling on a leather jacket
whatve you got
kamen nods to her and receives a quick smile for his trouble
they turn to watch the display clear replaced with a computer simulation of the neighboring solar system
a pair of incomings
they popped up on the medium range about thirteen twenty four local time
we figured on it being a magnetic anomaly but we ran a back trace just to make sure
turns out they dropped straight out of hyperspace
the simulation zooms in revealing two unidentified objects heading towards the planet in the center of the display
computer notations accompany them
curious thing is the mass detector says theyre too small to carry a deep space drive
sounds like a couple of escape shuttles
thats what we thought
have you got an updated lloyds almanac to cross reff them through
done it already
and if you thought that was interesting watch this
hiroko watches the course of the two objects simultaneously change
thosere pre programmed course adjustments youre looking at
tactical nukes maybe
everybody gives him a quick look but nobody says anything
its obviously not an appealing thought
wherere they headed
we ran a trajectory simulation
if they carry on along that path its possible theyll make intra orbital insertion
theres a great exhalation of breath and everyone swaps significant glances
hiroko seems worried
she scratches her forehead
i dont know what to make of this
get a copy of the telemetry relayed back to antarctica traffic control
better alert the nearest rimcorp base too
parsons nods suddenly serious
what do we tell em
just give them the facts
they can leap to their own conclusions
down here in the swamp the trunks of magnificent trees terminate in gnarled roots and disappear into watery murk much like a louisiana bayou
a group of attentive lemur type creatures suddenly bound for cover as a line of bullets thuds into the wood nearby
seconds later a loud humming noise intrudes o
and a pair of manta ray shaped hover bikes with sleek lines and garnish decals slams into frame suspended two feet above the mire their powerful turbines kicking up a
swirl of spray
the two bikers skid to a halt and watch the creatures scatter
ackland and york men who on earth might be called good ol boys are both riding one handed powerful hi tech rifles gripped in the other
york yelling you missed em ackland
little fuckers move too fast
lets do a sweep and catch em on the other side
york nods his head pulling his goggles down over his eyes
the two bikes roar off in pursuit
up on a mud bank at the base of a sturdy gantry tower with two blinking blue lights atop it stands the camp
it looks a little like a bedouin bivouac but up close we can see the techno fitted details
a hard featured woman seated next to a solid fuel burner sips from a mug while her vietnamese counterpart is manually loading large caliber bullets into a belt feed
they watch as ackland and york roar past whooping
minh scrambles out of the way as a beer can lobbed by york clatters to the ground near him
beauvais cups her drink with both hands assessing him
ahhh theyre just letting off some steam dont let em get to you
ackland and york arent such bad guys when you get to know em
just a couple of weekend warriors
she peers curiously at the clunky cartridges minhs thumbing into the belt feed
on the ground next to him is a widebore weapon on an over the shoulder guidance mechanism
nice howitzer youve got there
good argument for gun control
what are you going after rhino
i just wanna squeeze off a few rounds
sides they tagged the rhinos for the migration project so theyre protected
theyll dock you a months pay for just mentioning it
he peers into the belt and blows out some dirt
sure wish there was something on this planet with a bit of fight in it though
against a sea of stars a small metal shape hurtles towards us followed moments later by its identical twin
a strand of hirokos hair falls forward into her face slick with rain
she brushes up at the miserable weather
she and kamen are standing on one of the twelve feet in diameter wheels of the gargantuan haulage vehicle we saw outside the base earlier
up on the side of the cab is painted a nordic valkyrie with an impressive bustline next to which is the legend big bertha
two mechanics jan guttierez and kevin diller watch kamen point something out to hiroko from the vantage point of kamens crawler parked in the swamp nearby
see that sheathing on the suspension
same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers
the algae out here just isnt good on these new plastics
we havent used big bertha since we relocated the generator module
that was four months ago
i cant ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle its already costing too much as it is
if you want these things kept in working condition thats the only choice youve got
diller leans in to murmur quietly to guttierez
maybe she wouldnt be so tetchy if she got laid every once in a while
a buzzer inside the crawler goes off
diller gets up to answer
freeze my dick off
hiroko shakes her head dubiously at kamens comment
i dont know
i think well have to run it on a rota one month down one month operational
diller leans out of the crawlers cab and calls across
youre wanted in admin
she turns back to kamen
let me sort this out and well go over the logistics in my office
hiroko peers at the display with undisguised concern
a sense of urgency buzzes around the room
seven minutes ago the third course change in an hour
those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort
can we move it to a different orbit in time
parsons looks up from his board in harassment
already working on it
get off an all bands emergency distress and put it on a repeater
she meets kamens eyes
looks like you were right
someones lobbed a pair of smart missiles at us
kamen shakes his head
relay station like us out in the middle of the boonies why bother
all youre gonna do is punch a temporary hole in the traffic control net
thatd be small potatoes even for terrorists
parsons and cassie are all business at the control board
can you patch me a temporary loop on dcmgs
okay give me the numbers
she flips a switch
a nearby screen changes to display an orbital path sketched out in rectangular neon blocks
a cluster of thruster rockets on one corner of the relay frame ignites and the darkened bulk of the satellite begins to move
the two pods roar towards us at immense speed
the two blips on the holo board representing the pods make a marked alteration in their course
theyve changed their heading again
punch me in a solution for their delta vee
what do you need
a three second burn to port on my mark
its on the board
framed against the green backdrop of ryushi the predator pods rocket towards the communications platform
picking up velocity
a bead of sweat trickles down parsons temple
not gonna make it
the pod speeds thunderously into camera blotting out our view
one of the two blips on the holo display vanishes and three quarters of the monitors abruptly turn to static
he pulls off his headset with weary resignation
weve lost the downlink
the mass of the satellite tumbles end over end
a gaping rent is torn through it something sparks and flashes within
the second pod accelerates off curving into the atmosphere
a sonic thundercrack booms overhead york looks up in time to see an object sear across the dusk sky
he pulls his bike to a stationary hover
ackland has already dismounted as he watches the fireball hurtle to the ground
a booming echo resonates across the forest followed by a few plaintive screeches from the planets indigenous lifeforms before settling back into an eerie silence
meteor i guess
he raises a set of compact field binoculars to his face
through them he sees a thin haze of smoke rising from the treetops
dyou feel any impact shock
york uncertain not really
he lowers the binoculars and frowns
i tell you i used to be with a mining outfit on callisto and when something like that hits
believe me you know about it
do you wanna head back and call it in
ackland hesitant i dunno
something about this feels funny
he looks across at the plume of smoke snaking off into the sky
that is the damndest impact ive ever saw
the earth around the crater rim is charred and cracked some of the surrounding brush still aflame
a scorpion scuttles inquisitively to the edge of the pit and stops its stinger twitching hesitantly
we hear a low hum and the sound of metal on metal
before the scorpion can decide what to do its fate is sealed
a large metal claw comes down crushing it in an instant
a second claw emerges and a machine heaves itself out of the hole its surface smoking with heat
it pauses for a beat like some giant tarantula seeking prey them moves purposely outwards about twenty yards before halting
a hatch on the underside opens and a complex delivery mechanism extends
after a moment theres a low clunk and the mechanism retracts
in its place is an alien egg
the machine crawls off vanishing into the long reeds
hiroko sits on the front wheel of kamens crawler her knees pulled up to her chin staring off into a thin mist that makes the night impenetrable
behind and above the lights of the cranes and the communications array strobe on and off
above the bar on the main street is a flicking neon sign erected after the fact emblazoned with the words torchys
the muffled sounds of merry making from within become momentarily louder and hiroko glances over to see its pressure door crash back disgorging several drunken people
kamen follows them through
he spots hiroko and heads over
wondered where youd gotten to
wanted to be put on my own for a while
clear my head
didnt feel like whoopin it up with the rest of us blue collars huh
she shakes her head and manages a smile
ive got a lot of thinking to do
sides the room was getting too crowded for me
not too much of the socializing type then
no not really
more sort of the claustrophobic type
hiroko is straight faced
thats why i switched from orbiting to planetary installations
is that a fact
used to get it pretty bad
id wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch
how long you been out here for now anyway
and before that
six month stint on datus
what is this
theres a lot of talk goes around
thinks about it
i dont know
i guess ive just never found anywhere i really felt at home
she hugs her knees again and suddenly looks a whole lot more at ease
kamen spots a square glass balanced on one of the tires wide treads
what is that
real man drink
she offers the glass to him
he takes it and sniff cautiously
kamen hands the glass back and raises his own bottle
ill stick with my own
he sits with her and stares into the darkness
any luck raising acklands party
with the satellite down we cant transmit over the mountain range
hes most likely sitting there wondering why he cant raise us
first light well take a chopper out there and tell them to head back
you wanna fly out there with me
do me good to stretch my legs
hiroko takes a sip of her drink her brow furrowing
this whole things got me spooked
kamen hops off the wheel
dont worry about it
if the network goes by the book like everyone figures they will a marine gunboat from powellll drop by for a look see in four or five days
they can go poke around out there and find whatever it was hit us
all weve gotta do is sit tight
do you think acklandll sit tight
thered have to be a helluva good reason for him not to
a peculiar blue scanning beam plays over the rotating mass of the incapacitated satellite examining every section
it comes to the rent torn through it and pauses
from the scanners p
we see the structure of the satellite made up from a series of blue geodesic shapes
the damage registers as a cold black mass
the beam switches off and the hovering predator shuttle turns smoothly on its axis thrusting towards the planet
shafts of torch light fan out above the thick foliage in the darkness
york and ackland wade through the chin high reeds cursing
york looks down at his data stick a handheld torch with a multi purpose readout screen
well just keep looking
its gotta be
ackland falls toward onto something and york comes running
what is it
ackland steadies himself and the two men shine their torches at the rhythmically breathing shape on the ground
its a rhino
is it dead
no its still breathing
kinda clammy though
are you sure your sticks not broken
york looks at the data stick again
yeah its fine
god i hope that thing didnt bring down a virus
i told you we
their torch beams pan across a three foot high ovular shape
looks like a spore
fungus of some kind maybe
bloody big if it is
ackland steps cautiously forward to shine his torch inside
theres nothing inside
ackland looks disappointed
think our rhino mustve ate something that didnt agree with him
a heavy gust of air blows unexpectedly across the clearing with a banshee howl ruffling their hair
lets get back and call this in
wait a minute
york reluctantly follows ackland as he thrashes through the thinn ing foliage coming out at the rim of the impact crater
its beginning to partially collapse water seeping in
york runs his beam over something at the bottom of the shallow pit
what is that
is that metal fragments
acklands maybe getting a little nervous now
this is very fucking weird
he sees the churned earth and the muddy trail leading off into the broken foliage
its like something came out of the crater and went that way
theres a tiny click and ackland looks over to see york taking the safety off his rifle
ackland wordlessly unshoulders his too
they step around the crater and warily follow the ragged path to
ackland prods this second egg with his gun
theres a crackling noise and the top of the egg peels neatly open in four sections
the two men jump back in alarm and york laughs nervously
something organic is pulsing inside
ackland cranes his neck forward for a better look
theres an explosion of movement
a spindly shape with a long segmented tail launches itself jack in a box style at ackland
its a facehugger
ackland trips backwards caught off balance
his finger involuntarily squeezes the trigger of his rifle as he falls
a volley of shots describe and arc and light up the night with a percussive boom and we
a short distance across the clearing
something is watching them from the trees something with a heat vision p
we see the flare of acklands gunshots then snap in to see the multi colored from of his body toppling over trailing a purplish facehugger before we
one of acklands bullets taking a meaty chunk out of yorks thigh as he races forward to help his friend
the huggers tail is already around acklands throat its fingers scrabbling for purchase
york pulls at one set of digits and manages to raise them for just an instant
what we see is horrific the look of terror on acklands face and the questing tendril on the huggers underside trying to force its way between acklands lips
in a second its all over the facehugger struggles free of yorks grasp and clamps itself firmly on acklands face with a faint sucking sound
york shivers then uses his good leg to propel himself a few feet away
he watches the hapless teamster go rigid then stop moving altogether
oh god oh shit oh god
the facehuggers tail slithers tighter around acklands neck and as york quickly retrieves his rifle we
a predator vision shot watching the color bloom of york dragging acklands body away from the crater
it closes in on the facehugger giving us a muted x ray type view of circulatory fluid pumping around the hugger and into ackland
yorks limping badly a dark stain blossoming on his baggy fatigue trousers
acklands not a small man and the physical effort of hauling him through the reeds makes him sweat profusely
theres movement on the ground and york sees why one of the lemurs has fallen victim to another facehugger which dwarfs its small furry body
the huggers fingers all ripple simultaneously as it strengthens its hold the movement akin to somebody drumming their fingers on a table top
as york hauls ackland onto one of the bikes he hears a ticking sound from the trees like an engine cooling on a warm summers day
york clutches his rifle and stares upward
there seems to be a vague shimmering form in the bough of a tree
although it might be a trick of the light he isnt sticking around to find out
york guns the bike to life and roars off above the swamp
were looking at the site in colours the cold blue of empty alien eggs and the warm reds of just breathing animals rendered inert the facehugger parasites
a group of predators appear in three dimensional solidity their camouflage cloaks deactivated
the lead predator splashes across to the exposed roots of a tree and kneels down to examine an animal corpse curled up there
most of it has been madly mutilated by something erupting from inside its body
the predator looks up and scans the swamp ignoring the swarm of flies buzzing in the air
this time an oscillating line appears to the left of our view and a band sweeps quickly across the screen synchronous to us hearing different levels of sound static
this abruptly stops as the oscillating line begins to moves in peaks and valleys
the predator is picking up radio waves
a human voice albeit grossly distorted
we hear a rapid beeping movement sensors set up on tripods to warn against intruding animals
the sound brings beauvais out of her tent bleary eyed and fumbling with her pistol
shes suddenly wide awake when she sees yorks hover bike lit by the sensors flashing red strobe
it skids to a halt against a mud bank sending up a spray of silt
york climbs off the bike and stumbles then starts to unfasten the straps holding acklands body
give me a hand with ack
she races over to help york ease ackland up
how bad is
oh my god
as ackland is turned over beauvias gets her first look at a facehugger
she shies away repulsed
what is that
help me get him inside
york grits his teeth but the leg injury is too painful
he slumps slowly to the floor
beauvais yelling minh
minh get out here
a portable neon light in the tent flickers casting staccato bluish light over ackland and the facehugger
minh and beauvais stare at it in horrified fascination while york pulls a tourniquet around his thigh
have you tried prising it off
york shakes his head
i wanted to get him back here get him back to base
we lost the satellite link
theres a long pause while everyone considers the options
weve got no option
were gonna have to get it off
get real beauvais
that thing might chew his fucking face off for all be know
the motion sensor outside begins beeping again
minh catches beauvais head jerk
minh hefts his howitzer and leaves the tent
beauvais rounds on york continuing
how do you know its not already
i dont but i think we should just wait and let the doc take a look
minh walks towards a line of flashing red strobes at the perimeter of the camp the barrel of his weapon pointing casually forward
he studies the surrounding darkness
theres nothing out there
he shakes his head in disgust
minh muttering take a goddamn wrench to those things
he thumbs a stud on the top of the howitzer
theres a gentle whine and the hiss of hydraulic cylinders as the harness mechanism lifts the weapon up
it darts quickly to and fro a mechanical snake seeking a target
we see minhs hand in close up
in addition to the firing trigger theres also a thumb button
he squeezes it
the gun swings sharply around in a blinding movement tracking something automatically
theres a thunderous rumble as it fires off three shots in rapid succession
something that was only yards from minh appears and is blown backwards to crash against a tree bole a mass of luminous green liquid and motion
minh contd dumbstruck god
minh watches the helmeted predator fall face down into the water with a splash then lie motionless
york and beauvais are out of the tent in an instant
three humans in motion and hot
the triangular mechanism of the predators gun locks onto minh
a blast of plasma energy rips a gaping hole through minhs body spraying blood across york
he topples dead to the ground a look of pained surprise on his face
beauvais is there immediately racing across and scrabbling for the howitzer
she doesnt have time to take the harness off she just slides her finger through the trigger guard and starts squeezing off random shots
the air shimmers as an unseen shape races at her
theres a loud swish of sliding metal and a telescopic spear appears out of thin air
it slams through beauvais body lifting her off the ground and impaling her against a tree
york watches in horror as beauvais arms thrash around
a moment later her struggles cease and shed dropped to the floor like a broken marionette
theres a crackling sound and the hazy air around beauvais disappears
in its place is a predator a luminous green patch trickling from a wound on its arm
its head flicks around as it zeroes in on york the three red dots of the predators cannon following suit
yorks quick though already up and running when the plasma bolt explodes into the tree despite the pain in his leg
his options are limited
the hover bike is nearby
he sprints for that and his luck holds
the keys still in the ignition
he flips it
the engine coughs and then dies
york looks up
the wounded predator bounds across the clearing at frightened speed
york turns the key again but the predators almost upon him
the creature whips an ornately shaped lance from its back and thrusts it
just as the engine roars to life and the hover bike rises from the mud
the blade slices into the bikes body and jams there while one of its manta wings smacks into the predators jaw sending it reeling backwards into the swamp
york swivels the bike on its axis as another plasma bolt rips into the rear melting away a sizable chunk of the bodywork
he sees a predator handing from a tree and the shimmering of two more predators in their camouflage nearby
hes not sticking around to argue though
york jams the throttle hard and the bike shoots off into the bayou as more cannon blasts blossom around him
the group of predators appear in the camp and cautiously survey the area
the lead predator the one with the distinctive armor crosses to the tent and opens the entry flap
the extraterrestrial hunter scrutinizes the pulsing facehugger on ackland for a long moment but takes no further action
we pan slowly across the deserted campsite
there isnt a soul there human or otherwise
the wind whistles eerily through the tree boughs
first light the next day the sun rising on the horizon
a chopper actually a twin turbine heli jet flies in low above the veil of mist hanging over the treetops
the cockpit is small a two seater with room for cargo in the back
kamens in the pilot seat and hirokos riding shotgun
the controls moving by themselves on autopilot
a repetitive beeping causes kamen to look up from his magazine
from out of the window of the chopper we see the twin blue lights of the navigation beacon blinking on and off above the trees
kamen nudges hiroko awake
were at the beacon
he switches the controls over to manual and takes the chopper down
hiroko rubs the sleep from her eyes
twin searchlights on the underside of the descending chopper sweep across the clearing
the encampment has been wrecked much of is reduced to a twisted tangle of smoking debris
all terrain gear lowers from the chopper as it makes a watery landing in the swamp
kamen and hiroko stare at the site in disbelief
kamen hauls an automatic pulse rifle from the rear
looks like trouble
kamen reaches under the pilots seat and pulls out a hand pistol
passes it to her
used one of these before
hiroko coolly examines it
fabrique nationale tactical autoloader
uses twelve mill hollow o rounds with through the barrel smart laser sighting
sure i can handle this
hirokos show boating and kamen knows it but he still cant help being a little bit impressed
watch were you point it
the two of them pick their way across mangled tripods and charred canvas
part of the bivouac has collapsed one of the guide ropes has burned through
hiroko quietly somebody picked an argument
check out the tent
kamen nods and heads off that way while hiroko carefully inspects the wreckage dotted around the perimeter
kamen opens the tent flap and peers inside
acklands on the cot sweating heavily
there is no sign of the facehugger
across the clearing hiroko turns a piece of charred plating over in her hands before discarding it
her foot slips on an object sunk into the soft mud
its minhs howitzer
a dark slippery patch coats the metal
she crouches down and rubs her fingers through it
kamens voice intrudes o
ive found ackland
she begins to cross the camp and her foot catches on a taut length of rope
something swings down from the trees hitting her squarely in the face and knocking her off her feet
hiroko cries out in fear and surprise then freezes at what she sees
two bloodied bodies dangle head first from the bough overhead beauvais and minh
each has been skinned and is beyond recognition
kamen hears her exclamation and is out of the tent in an instant
he stops in his tracks
its raining again at the base
under cover of an overhang hiroko watches as ackland is trundled away from the chopper on a paramedic trolley by guttierez and doc revna an indian woman in her late
as kamen slams the choppers side door we see that hiroko has left her leather jacket on the passenger seat
kamen runs after revna clutching a clear plastic bag
wait a minute doc
he hands the bag over to revna
she peers at the contents curiously
the facehugger is inside stiff and shriveled
is this it
found it curled up in a corner of the tent
revna shakes her head
never come across one of these before
maybe the original survey team did
ill run it through records and see what comes up
guttierez checks that acklands bodys secure on the trolley
kamen raps him on the back to get his attention
see if you can get someone to check out the chopper
whats the problem
she was running a little sluggish on the way back
think the turbines might be playing up
give me twenty minutes and ill do it myself
wherere the bodies
bagged and in the back
theyre not a pretty sight
ackland is wheeled into a freight elevator
as kamen and hiroko walk away across the rain swept platform a shimmering from detaches itself from the rear of the chopper and lowers itself to the heli jet pad
a newly arrived predator scans the towers and modules of the relay station with great interest
an oscillating red line appears to the left of the shot as the predator analyses hirokos voice pattern
distorted not a pretty sight
not a pretty sight
he reaches down to his wrist computer and activates it
under the cathedral like light filtering through the trees above a row of metal spikes have been driven into the earth
four are topped with still smoking alien skulls
two and empty
a newly decapitated alien head is turned around in another predators hands in admiration
this predator thrusts his trophy onto the next spike then stares at the vacant one for a long moment
his wrist computer bleeps for attention
with nothing to do most of the screens are out and the remaining personnel bored
parsons is reading a magazine with his feet up on the console uninterested in hiroko and kamens conversation nearby
im going to need you to co sign the report
until we come up with something thisll be treated as first degree murder
when we get the link back and i send this in i
ll throw a fit
ah dont worry about i
theyre the least of your problems right now
what do you mean
urioste walks up very serious
can i have a word
three pump failed a half hour ago
the algae must have clogged up an intake duct
think i spoke too soon
how long before we start noticing the difference
i reckon itll be another day before the smell gets unbearable
beauvais usually fixes it but
hiroko knows what she means
beauvais is dead
can you handle it
sure i can manage
but im not going into the pit on my own
hiroko to urioste alright get somebody from the auto shop
to kamen is that alright
yeah no problem
ask diller hes good with his hands
urioste exchanges a grin with cassie
ill go along with that
a shrill trilling from his console communicator makes parsons leap up to answer
long beat yeah
a close up of an eye bright blue and dilated
doc revnas shining a hand held light into acklands face
acklands regained consciousness but is far from happy
hes sitting on the edge of a cot in the base infirmary an antiseptic room full of automated medical equipment
the autodoc is suspended from the ceiling nearby a circular cluster of sophisticated manipulator arms tipped with cutting blades and surgical paraphernalia
hey cmon doc i feel fine
revna flicks off the probe
the heads okay but i could sink a six pack
i want you off alcohol for at least seventy two hours
ive got some toxin build up tests still to run
revna shakes her head and turns to kamen
hes broken a fever that would kill a mule but if he says hes alright im prepared to believe him
hes all yours
she watches from behind kamen
what happened out there ack
ackland consternated what do you mean what happened
what am i doing back here
hiroko insistent whats the last thing you can remember
ackland thinks hard
watched a meteor hit over linsons
hiroko and kamen exchange significant glances
yeah it impacted really off
we went out to the crash site
kamen turns to revna
show him fido
revna pulls out a cylindrical glass stasis tube from a wall rack
she hands it to ackland
he studies the dead facehugger floating inside with morbid fascination
ring any bells
ackland tries hard to think but its as if a walls slammed down hard on his mind
not really no
ugly little sonuvabitch
what is it
we thought you might be able to tell us
i found it by your cot at the camp
you were out cold
what did york say
beauvais and minh are dead ackland
yorks gone awol unless you can help us go some way toward disproving our suspicion hes the prime suspect right now
the news hits ackland hard
he falters and leans back addressing can i
have some water
she goes to fetch a cup
its lunchtime and the sound of machinery steaming food mixes with the chatter of the twenty or so personnel eating there
hiroko and kamen are deep in conversation across a table
do you believe him
i dont know him well enough to say
if we were back on earth we could run him though an aldhoven test and find out for sure
theres not much we can do out here
kamen stares hard at her
thats not much of an answer and hiroko knows it
alright then for what its worth
yes i do
kamen digs appreciatively into a container of food with his fork
you should try this seasoned stuff
guttierez approaches the table carrying something
got a present for you
he hands hirokos leather jacket over to her
oh ive been looking for this
where was it
you left it in the chopper
oh and before i forget don
i ran that test you wanted on the turbines
they checked out just fine
a metal rail surrounds the perimeter of the platform
diller leans against it down by the access ramp smoking a cigarette and idly blowing rings into the air
brewster pricks up her years and begins to quietly snarl
diller glances down at her curiously
whats the matter girl
you smell something
now the rhino are restless too
cassie walks across the concrete roadway to join them
rhinos look a little antsy brewster stops snarls and progresses onwards to full fledged barking
never seem em act like this before
cassie and diller are warm but the rhinos are brewster are hotter still
their voices and brewsters barks are filtered to the point of unrecognizability eerily distorted
cassies the first to hear the sound
do you hear that
diller straightens up looking out into the surrounding trees
its a faint hum getting louder every second
a hoverbike appears trailing smoke from one of its turbine intakes as it hurtles towards the base
halfway between the trees and the ramp it clips a fallen log and spins end over end
its rider flies through the air and hits the swamp face first
diller and cassie race down the ramp with brewster yelping excitedly in the lead
i dont believe it
diller splashes through the swamp and pulls the limp body out of the mire
blood has caked around his wounded leg
he looks in a bad way
help me get him up to infirmary
wait a minute
something else has caught cassies eye
a something almost two metres in length protruding from the rear of the wrecked hoverbike
grasping the haft firmly she works it free
cassie examines the predator spear and slowly shakes her head
the concealed hunter watches as the colorised human curiously turns the weapon over in her hands
revna sits at a desk and peers into a microscope
every so often she grunts in satisfaction and types something into her computer terminal
the stasis tube containing the dead facehugger stands to one side of the computer screen
the infirmary is very quiet and only the gentle throb of the air conditioning intrudes
ackland tosses uncomfortably on his cot
he finally sits up and massages his chest
revna lowers her pen and looks across
what is it
its nothing doc
touch of indigestion
do you want a tablet
ackland winces in pain
his breathings getting heavy
revna gets up swiftly and crosses to an automated pharmacy
acklands beginning to cough now
that sounds nasty
ill give you a couple of demazine
ackland nods again
his coughing has deepened and now hes banging his chest with a balled fist
revna hurries over with three red tablets and a disposable cup of water
ackland takes them gratefully and gulps them down
the effect is almost immediate ackland quietens and an appreciative smile comes to his pale lips
before he has a chance to elaborate ackland coughs once more
a thin spray of blood and saliva dots revnas white smock and speckles her cheek
acklands scrabbling fingers grab her lapels as he begins to hyperventilate
she pulls away dragging him from the bed in the process
he falls to the floor his moans growing in volume
hold on its alright
im gonna give you a shot
her fingers tremble as she clumsily examines a tray of surgical instruments
she finds a pneumatic spray injector fully charged with a vial of amber liquid attached
ackland screams and fall backwards onto the floor his hands clawing at the air
revna fumbles with the injector control and gives him a blast in his upper arm
ackland convulses once then goes still his eyes staring fixedly at the ceiling
the infirmary is deathly quiet once again
we hear a gentle cracking like twigs being snapped
revna watches in horrified fascination as a pool of blood spreads swiftly outward across the floor from below acklands corpse
revna shudders as the body moves a little then is rolled over by something underneath it
what she sees
acklands body slumps forward onto its front revealing a gaping cavity in his back
bits of spine and ribcage are just visible
a chestburster the second stage of the alien lifeform pulls itself clear and wipes red gunk from its body with a pair of still underdeveloped arms
around its head is a distinctive nascent crest
it kicks away from ackland with a powerful push from its legs quickly gaining balance
after a moment appraising its new environment it stalks off behind a table
revna thinks quickly
she leaps forward and thumps a large red stud next to the pressure door which promptly rumbles closed
the room is bathed in pools of shadows
plenty of hiding space for the creature
revna hears breaking glass making her start
she cautiously edges over to the autodoc and looks up into the forest of probe arms
theres a wicked looking blade there the kind used in major surgery
revna reaches up and twists the base it detaches easily
now shes armed
stooped over she begins to stalk the chestburster
theres a flurry of movement and suddenly the hunter becomes the hunted
the chestburster vaults from the table at her with a shrill shriek and revna blindly swings her make shift knife in defense
we hear a sizzle like frying bacon
hiroko sprints down the corridor and reaches the infirmary
diller cassie and a few others are crowded around outside
york lays unconscious on one of the medical trolleys next to the door making access difficult
above them a hinged flap on the wall lies open revealing a circular mechanism beneath
brewster scratches at the bulkhead and whines
muffled thumps come from within
york just turned up outside
were trying to get him into infirmary
hiroko astonished york
hiroko leans over to examine him but a particularly loud crash from within the infirmary distracts her
whats going on
the doors sealed from inside
doc revnas in there and it sounds like acklands going nuts
force the door
its pressure sealed
guttierez races up and hands diller a wrench with a shaped tip
he inserts the end into the open flap and pulls hard the physical effort showing on his face
the door grinds open about eight inches
the bloodied chestburster forces itself through the narrow gap hissing vehemently
yellow fluid wells from a wound in its crested skull dissolving everything it comes into contact with
the small group gathered around fall back in panic jarring yorks trolley and knocking hiroko to the floor
brewster barks at the chestburster which tenses as if to leap
diller brings the wrench down but the chestburster evades his blow and takes flight
it strikes at hiroko who reflexively draws her head back and escapes with nothing more than a light scratch to the cheek
the alien disappears down the corridor leaving a trail of smeared blood and a series of acidic pits which melt the grillework flooring
guttierez bends down and helps hiroko to her feet
shocked she mutters something to herself in japanese and regains some of her composure
get after it dont let it get away
diller stands there with the metal bar
does she think hes nuts
this galvanises diller
he races off in pursuit
jan give me a hand over here
hiroko and guttierez try to force the door but diller was right it wont budge
hiroko slips her arm through the gap and fumbles around blindly
she must have hit the control knob because the door slides back
cassie looks inside
oh my god
she turns away and retches
hiroko steps through and goes pale
there are blood smears over everything and its all guttierez can do to stop brewster from getting in there
parsons finger traces a path along a set of computer schematics displayed on a suspended glass screen
it left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here
what is that
secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system
i found the grating ripped right off
the little fucker was strong
where does that lead to
all the waste gets treated broken down and flushed out into the swamp
if it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked out
youve checked that end
not yet no
i dont want that thing on my installation
i want it caught and destroyed
cornering it shouldnt be a problem
each part of this station is basically a self sufficient deep space transport module running off external couplers
if we disconnect them and seal off every section weve got a ceiling of about thirty six hours on internal power
that should give us ample time to find it
pull some trackers and headsets out of stores and ill sign a release for the weapons
cassie organise a team roster and put it on the board
cassie nods soberly
hiroko looks at everybody and her words are carefully chosen
i dont care how you kill this thing just be careful not to get in its way when it bleeds
you all saw what happened to doc revna
there are nods of agreement and general enthusiasm all round
nobody wander off on their own until its found
keep in pairs
diller once the first teams done their sweep i want you to go down with annie to three pump while she replaces it
one final point
killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in itself
however just to add a little incentive
im authorizing a hefty bonus in the next pay packet for whoever does
this seems to appeal to those assembled there
theres a palpable buzz in the air
alright lets get to it
new york rules apply
york is recounting his story to kamen and hiroko in a hushed voice
small beads of sweat stand out on his forehead and his eyes are haunted by remembrance
the mans a mess
i mean these
these mothers were
they look like bushmen but they had all this hi tech shit strapped all over em
they mustve wasted beauvais and minh inside thirty seconds
minh got off a couple of shots from that cannon of his but he might as well have been using a b b gun
i dont know how the hell i made it out of there alive
he nods toward the predator spear in hirokos hands
the one i clipped with the hoverbike shoved that at me
whatever its made of it went straight through a double layer of honeycomb polyalloy composite like it was butter
york shakes his head in fear
i dont wanna ever come up against those things again
kamen claps the man on the shoulder to reassure him
dont worry about it yorkie
youre safe now
go get come rest
he gets to his feet and leaves the room
hiroko waits until the door slides shut behind him
so what do you think
what do i think
i think if those marines from powell dont shift their butts getting here were gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldnt
its late and the bases exterior lighting casts yellow pools of light across the metal and concrete thoroughfares
guttierez and de vries a tough looking afrikaan woman with a think accent looks uneasily about them
another group of people with trackers and guns are searching around in the background
nearby the vertical yellow column of a suspension crane gantry towers high above
one more sweep
one more sweep
one more sweep
im getting tired of one more fuckin sweep
were been lookin for this thing for three days now and found zip
ah quit griping
keeps you in shape doesnt it
i was in shape before we started doing this
de vries pauses listening to the sound from the surrounding forest
listen to that
guttierez cocks his head and listens
he has no idea what she means
listen to what
thats what i mean
this is the quietest ive ever heard it
guttierez shivers in the wind as he looks out into the impenetrable blackness beyond the confines of the base
next time you have a thought like that
keep it to yourself
brewster the dog stares in fascination at the rhinos through the meshwork fence of their pens
the animals move around in agitation
not at her but at something else
something spooking the rhinos
the rhinos the dog and the two humans can be seen way above on the platforms edge bright red
indistinct inside their camouflage cloaks the small group of predators wade carefully through the water towards the base of the installation
diller and uriostes voices heard o
in hushed tones
the scraping of metal on metal
what is that
is that it
think thats a regulator valve
theres more noise
ah got it
about a dozen fluorescent strips ringing the small circular chamber illuminate
three others flicker erratically one of them remaining unlit
diller waves the tracker cautiously around and keeps his pulse rifle level
he enters followed by urioste
shes carrying a portable but bulky piece of machinery
are you getting anything
diller sarcastic yeah eyestrain
whats with the lights
theyre always like that
head office are real cheap when it comes to spares
wave that thing in the corner
diller sweeps the tracker carefully around
the small screen registers nothing
the rooms clean
urioste pulls at a two piece hexagonal grating set in the center of the floor
its heavy and thick with grease but she doesnt seem to mind
below it is what looks like a round metal plug
recessed into its surface is a lever next to a central pressure valve with handholds on either side
she turns the lever
theres a loud clunk and a plume of steam jets out of the valve
give me a hand with this
grunting the two of them pull the thick metal plug clear of the pit
murky water sloshes around below
urioste pulls a second lever and hidden pumps make the water level drop rapidly
pass me over that tripod will you
leaning against the wall behind diller is a sturdy metal tripod topped with a block and tackle arrangement
a hook dangles below this its thick metal cabling going up through the block and tackle and connecting to the drum of a small industrial winch attached securely to the
diller hands the tripod over to urioste
she splays the legs apart and inserts their tips into matching holes around the open pit
guttierez and de vries walk over to the rhino pen brewster pulling at her leash
guttierez frowns at what he sees
all the rhinos are nervously huddled together in the far corner
thats real peculiar behavior
de vries fingers a rough metal edge
take a look at this
guttierez moves over for a closer look
theres a torn hole in the meshwork just big enough for a rhino to squeeze through
blood and fragments of skin coat the edge of the gap
one of em must have escaped
thats impossible man
this fence is high tensile
the breaking toleranced stand up to the strain of a rhino easy
i know i put it up
guttierez shines the flashlight along the deck
a trail of smeared blood runs all the way to the perimeter
the surrounding fence has been buckled and twisted
they cross to it and look down at the swamp
the torch beam sparkles on the murky water far below
theres no way a rhinod survive that drop
goldsmiths gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies
thats a fact
guttierez tracker starts to bleep
he raises it excitedly
whoa wait a minute
just got a reading
most of the lights in admin are off and the rooms deserted
parsons is seated away from his usual station at a console topped by ten monitor screens each displaying a securi cam picture
he looks tired
kamen comes up behind him carrying two mugs of coffee
hows it going
yeah good evening to you too
he takes the coffee gratefully and sips at it
todays partys finished their sweep the relief teams out there now
everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto shop
you should hit the sack too
nah ill stick it out for another hour or so
what times sundown
bout five minutes
give me a yell is something happens
you got it cowboy
guttierez sweeps the tracker slowly around and brewster begins to gently snarl
de vries pulls on the dogs leash to quieten her
its up there somewhere
he shoulders his rifle
a metal ladder runs up the side of one of the base buildings
guttierez crosses to it and starts to climb the first few rungs
are you nuts
just the two of us
ive seen this mother de vries
we can bag it no problem
forget it man
cmon de vries
think of the bonus
fuck the bonus
i hate heights
you wouldnt get me up there even if it wasnt night
guttierez starts to climb the ladder
what the hell are you doing
hey fair enough
if you wont come ill handle it myself
de vries runs her fingers through her hair in frustration
comes to a decision counter to what she wants to do
wait a minute
guttierez stops climbing
ill come with you
she drags the dog over to a metal stanchion and ties the leash around it
but im going first
anything you say mammacitta
she climbs around guttierez and begins to ascend the ladder
brewster whimpers and plaintively barks after them
the rooftop is dark mysterious
pieces of retrofitted junk can be seen in silhouette edged in light from way below
de vries and guttierez carefully step over the threshold
they speak in whispers
careful of that edging there
yeah i got it
although we have an outstanding view of the night lights of the base up here the immediate gloom is impenetrable
wheres that flashlight
by way of an answer a powerful ray cuts a swathe through the air
de vries takes the torch from him and shines it on the ground
circular extractor fans rotate quietly in the gloom
still got him
its moving slow
on the left
de vries plays the flashlight across the rooftop
little bit further
the beam comes to rest on a protruding piece of apparatus
a short range antennae about seven feet wide
yeah yeah yeah
right there right behind the antennae
i think were got it cornered
hiroko bends down to inspect a small plastic grating fitted flush with the roadway
the broken grillework is melted outwards
kamen and two other men caldwell and thomas stand behind
the door to the food storage locker was smashed open
it must have come straight out of here
keep your eyes peeled
she voices her concern to kamen
if it got out of the systems it could be anywhere
its very quiet and we can hear the nervous breathing of guttierez and de vries as they cautiously stalk forward
hold it hold it
im picking up another signal
de vries looks around unnerved
just behind us over to the right
de vries shines her beam over the surface of the yellow crane to their rear shifting her attention to and fro from it and the antennae
cant see a thing
are you sure
the second blip on the small screen abruptly vanishes
might be a glitch
from behind the metal disc there comes a shuffling sound followed by a metallic thunk
this gets their attention
the two of them halt in their tracks
thats no glitch
its alright its cool
is it still moving
no hes stopped hes totally still
just take it nice and easy babe
nice and easy
a small many limbed shape hurls itself from the confines of its hiding place with a feral shriek
de vries yelps in surprise and looses off a spray of bullets
hiroko looks up startled by the sound of gunfire
she sees the rooftop of one of the building modules lit by tracer fire
brewsters tethered nearby barking furiously
a think metal cable connected to her jacket harness suspends urioste in the gloom of the pump shaft
in front of her is a machine part we saw her carry earlier
with the strap of a flashlight clenched in her mouth shes just finishing up bolting the part to the larger piece of machinery in an alcove with simultaneously doing her
best not to touch the walls which are covered by a thin layer of gunge
the report of de vries weapon can be heard even down here perhaps more startling in the confined space
urioste jumps dropping the flashlight into the water in the process
diller turns away from the winch and peers into and beyond the access tunnel leading outside
uriostes voice floats up out of the shaft
muffled what was that
diller raising his voice something outside
the wind whips at guttierez as he blinks away his shock
de vries keeps her torch beam on the moving shape
it halts by the edge of the roof and stares at them
oh nice going man
it was a lemur
a goddamn lemur
guttierez radio headset crackles to life
on headset guttierez what the hells going on up there
sorry about that boss
false alarm thats all
de vries glances around the rooftop annoyed
hey look lets forget it
theres nothing up here
de vries in close up glowing brightly
her voice replayed and distorted
nothing up here
nothing up here
uriostes flashlight bobs up and down on the water below still lit and well out of reach
urioste disgustedly shit
muffled whats the matter
ive dropped my torch into the water
give me about
a meter and a halfs worth of slack
diller crosses to the wall mounted winch
on the mechanisms side is a luminous digital counter giving the current cable depth in meters
he pulls a throw switch and the display slowly changes from to
as the cable feeds out
urioste descends the dingy shaft partially abseiling off the walls
her feet almost tread water
shes down as far as she can go
uriostes voice echoes up out of the pit
urioste contd o
muffled thats enough
diller locks the winch switch back into its up position
the whine of the cable feed stops immediately
urioste stretches out to the floating lamp flexing her fingers
six slender fingers explode from beneath the waters surface and clamp like a vise around uriostes wrist
a sleek eyeless head follows trailing a body straight out of a charnel house nightmare
a scream forms in her throat rapidly cut off as the aliens other hand clamps firmly over her mouth jerking her downwards
diller whirls in response to the choked cry from below
he sees the winch tripod above the shaft rattle the cable going taut as an anglers line
the wall mounted drum is yanked so hard the lever leaps from its clamped position freely unspooling cable at a frightening rate
the digital counter flickers rapidly
diller watches the tripods tubular legs buckle and collapse under the tremendous strain
he scrambles for the winch lever and only just manages to lock it firmly into place the over stressed cable vibrating with a low metallic twang as it hits the
dillers moment of satisfaction is short lived the deep sunk bolts attaching the mechanism to the wall are pull outward by the colossal force from below
he leaps aside avoiding the heavy piece of machinery as it hurtles towards him
watches it disappear noisily into the conduit
dillers quivering fingers grope for his flashlight
he feverishly reaches the shafts edge and peers into the darkness
what he sees
the torchbeam picks out the biomechanical form of the alien emerging from the sewage and effortlessly climbing the shaft walls towards him
recoiling in horror he makes a run for the door
half way there he remembers his pulse rifle and dives to the floor grasping it just as the alien reaches the top
diller fumbles with the safety and give the creature a full blast on rock and roll blasting it back into the pit
guttierez and de vries hear the gunfire from below
the hell was that
the predators gaze snaps away from the two humans and down onto the platform below
he watches the infra red shapes of other people running towards the source of the shots
dillers on his feet and shakily heading for the exit as another aliens claws emerge from the exposed hole
he races across the threshold and slams the thin inner door closed
in a hand held shot were running with hirokos group along the narrow catwalk bridging the roadway to the pump room kamen taking the lead
diller sprints out of the building like a bat out of hell and collides with him
diller breaks free of the other mans grasp
he looks as if hes about to say something but never gets the chance
theres a sound of tearing metal and a hissing seven foot express train of teeth and biomechanical limbs erupts from the shadows
gazing down at the platform an unseen hunter watches the swift black shape of the alien in amongst the group of humans
from the corner of her eye de vries sees something moving nearby
she violently pulls guttierez out of the path of the shimmering form that barges past them launching itself from the rooftop
parsons sits bolt upright in his chair as the scene outside is relayed to his bank of screens by an exterior securi cam
oh my god
with superhuman strength the alien brutally back hands diller splintering his skull and killing him instantly
his body caromes into thomas knocking the man to the floor
the alien turns to kamen its questing fingers closing around his throat and hauling him off the ground
the space on the catwalk it limited theres so many people its impossible to get a clean shot
get out of the way
hiroko draws a bead on the alien
she flips off the safety on her rifle
its the tiniest click but the alien somehow senses danger
its skeletal tail lashes out sending both her and the weapon flying
caldwell gets in for his shot but the tails there in a second
it strikes like a snake
the stinger punctures caldwells chest and throat
nobody could survive something like that
the alien flicks its skull back around to kamen
the mans head is inches away from its eyeless face
a row of burnished metal teeth open
the toothed inner tongue ready to strike
something lands heavily close up jarring the catwalk
the alien drops kamen and whirls
a spear wielded by an invisible form appears out of nowhere and pierces the aliens midriff spraying acidic fluid
the creature emits a outraged shriek and flails around its ubiquitous tail arcing toward the camouflaged assailant
the stinger makes contact theres a sputtering sound as the predators cloaking device begins to flicker spasmodically giving us peek a boo glimpses of its natural form
electrical sparks dance around the predators ruin wrist computer luminous green blood welling from a wound in his arm
from out of the pump room comes more noise like metal being trashed in a compactor
hiroko screams at kamen whos coughing painfully next to the door panel
get the door
kamen hastily slaps the close button and both halves of the exterior pressure bulkhead rumble together
a second alien appears from the shadows within and prises its fingers into the dwindling gap struggling for purchase
despite the aliens best efforts the door motors are too powerful and the opening seals with a satisfying solid clunk
muffled pounding comes from the other side
nearby thomas has retrieved caldwells weapon in the heat of the fight and is bringing it to bear on the predator
at the last possible moment hiroko sees what hes about to do
reflexively she knocks the barrel away as thomas looses a volley of shots
the predators speech analyser plays back her vocal patterns as white hot bullets sear the night
snapping in for a closer look at her
one of the aliens hands clamps firmly onto the predators mask and wrenches it off
hiroko stares at the predators face in fascination
from the distinctive features we see that its broken tusk
the predators good hand flashes down to his thigh almost too quick to follow
in one rapid movement a circular smart weapon is brought up slicing the front of the alien skull away from its head
in a feat of strength the predator lifts his opponents corpse on the end of the spear and hurls it over the catwalk railing
not wasting a second broken tusk performs an almost vertical bound of some twenty feet with astounding grace
he grips a pipe running down the side of one of the building modules then clambers over the roofs edge and finally disappears from view
brewster continues to bark frenetically
hirokos headset has been knocked to the floor and a frantic muted voice is coming from it
she picks it up and presses the transmit switch
hiroko into headset its alright rob
parsons listens to hiroko suddenly wide awake
the morning shifts are starting to filter in and its obvious to them somethings wrong
hiroko contd o
on speaker everythings under control
wait a second
thomas is moving from diller to caldwell checking them for signs of life
hiroko catches his eye
thomas shakes his head
guttierez and de vries race across the platform to join the stunned survivors of the skirmish
guttierez bends down by dillers body
thomas lays a hand on guttierez arm
come on man
leave it alone
dear lord jesus
this is like a bad dream man
a bad fucking dream
hiroko thinks quickly and comes to a decision
she speaks into her radio headset
i want you to evac everybody from the non connective modules into admin
that goes double for anybody
hiroko contd o
on speaker already out here
were going to lock every bulkhead and seal the base
hiroko turns her headset off and watches numerous rotating coloured lights dotted around the platform start to blink on and off
kamen coughs a few more times
are you okay
kamen rubs his throat
brewsters barks cease replaced instead with a terrified low whining
whats with the dog
guttierez jogs over to brewster
lowers his rifle to the ground and fumbles with the knot tying the dog to the pipe
hey cmon now girl
lets just get this knot undone
a spray of plastic shards explodes not three feet away from guttierez
the rifle goes skittering away out of reach and he scrambles away as an alien half pulls itself out of the sewer overflow wet and glistening
brewsters a mass of fur totally out of control
when the alien lashes out to grab the howling animal theres nothing guttierez can do
brewsters legs are the last thing we see thrashing helplessly as shes dragged down into the splinter edged gap
get out of there man
thomas grabs caldwells rifle from the deck
he races towards guttierez with de vries close behind
from behind comes the sound of more rupturing plastic as biomechanoid limbs struggle up out of newly broken ducts
thomas heaves the rifle over the heads of the emerging aliens
although guttierez snags it awkwardly he quickly turns the barrel on the relentless creatures
chew on this
de vries races up to join them screaming as she fires
kamen glances down at this trackers tiny screen
it shows clusters of signals lots of them
kamen hollering theyre all around theyre in the drainage system
de vries reacts swiftly loosing a round of shots at the emerging aliens
guttierez yells across to kamen
get your ass out of here boss
aliens are appearing everywhere
from the overflow ducts over the platform edges along overhead cable supports
having taken on the genetic characteristics of their hosts many of them are non humanoid
all of them are living nightmares
oh my god
cassie brushes her teeth in front of the wall mounted mirror of her tiny bathroom cubicle
a raucous emergency klaxon goes off in the corridor outside
thomas guttierez and de vries are cut off
as they race swiftly down the street guttierez tries hard to interpret his trackers signals
a particularly loud bleep registers from a source immediately behind them
he glances over his shoulder and sees an alien crawling down the outside of a module towards them
de vries head turns
she sees the alien and nails it with a rapid burst
it falls onto the concrete nearby writhing in its death throes
the group round the corner of a building
across the street from them is parked kamens crawler
they scramble up into the cab
guttierez throws himself into the drivers seat
an alien sprints at the crawler with bared teeth
thomas looses a shot blasting it backward into a pepsi sign
yo momma boneface
de vries to guttierez cmon man punch this cow
guttierez fumbles at the ignition
they keys are there
he flips them and the engine growls to life
from way up here weve got an outstanding view of the humans running across the platform
crouching on a bright yellow catwalk broken tusk presses closed a panel on the small container balanced on his knee
inside it are rows of metal instruments with a pristine surgical quality about them
broken tusk flexes his hand experimentally
satisfied he clips the medical kit onto his back before getting to his feet
standing around him are several other predators
all but one have their camouflage cloaks activated
the sound of gunfire way across the station draws their attention
hiroko and kamen bolt towards an external hatch with kamen laying down a field of covering fire on full automatic
the blaze of light from the rifles barrel abruptly stops
im out of ammo
get inside get inside
hiroko hears a horrible noise nearby
a field of cows being slaughtered by machetes would sound like this
theyre in with the rhino
an alien is smashed sideways into the one solid wall of the pen broadsided and instantly crushed by a ton of frenzied rhino
its yellow blood eats into the weighty quadruped eliciting anguished bellows of pain from the hapless creature
alien stingers slice through the air
rhinos try to bolt but are intercepted by inhumanly powerful forces
its wholesale carnage
were moving swiftly along the rooftops and surveying the melee below lessening the distance with each second
several indefinable figures plunge into the fray creating anarchy within the aliens ranks
the biomechanoids hiss with fury as the predators join battle against them
an alien hurls itself through the air and onto the speeding crawlers roof
the cabs occupants react as the thin roof buckles slightly
skeletal fingers slice through ripping at the metal like a can opener
thomas raises his rifle and looses a fusillade of shots through the roof
one of them ricochets off the interior shattering the windscreen
theres a thump from outside
you got im
their triumph is short lived
globules of yellow acid perforate the roof like swiss cheese dripping down on them
guttierez floors the brakes
the crawler swings through ninety degrees before screeching to a halt
cassie enters admin at a run
before it was empty
now its sheer chaos
she shoves her way through dozens of grim faced people
parsons is standing at a console yelling into his headset
seal everything now
cassie thank christ
were under attack
york races in shouting above the clamor
the son of bitches got into e wing
theyre ripping it apart
somebody get over there with some guns
cassie watches the scene unfolding on the banks of monitors
people mouthing unheard words into camera
bursts of static
fleeting glimpses of nightmarish shapes darting across the picture
how many of them are there
guttierez group hurriedly exits the crawler
a cloud of acrid smoke rapidly fills the cabin
de vries coughing move it man
the dead aliens corpse tumbles through the acid eaten hole falling into the cabs rear seat and promptly burning through that as well
not far away across the platform the massive doors to the auto shop hanger are rumbling slowly closed
guttierez shouting hold the doors hold the doors
they dont hear him
the doors seal with a boom of finality
over there on the right
thomas sees the two aliens nimbly climbing the platforms edge
he squeezes off about five shots managing to kill the first alien
these bastards aint so tough
thomas looks concernedly at guttierez
is that thing working
guttierez takes off the headset and scrutinises it closely
the casings cracked
de vries rips her headset off and urgently passes it to him
channel twenty six
despite their ferocity and weapons its clear that the small group of predators are being overrun by the alien horde
broken tusks shoulder cannon swivels automatically blowing away another attacker
hearing a distinctive scream he looks across the platform
one of the predators its camouflage cloak flickering intermittently is trying to resist being dragged down into a duct
the two aliens in either side plunge their tail stingers into the predators body making it cry out in agony
pumped up with adrenalin kamen reaches an intersection and encounters a harrowing tableau
an alien blocks his way on the other side of a corridor bulkhead holding a struggling man above the floor
its piston like tongue shoots into the mans skull spraying gore
the alien sees kamen and its mouth twists into a bloody snarl
both kamen and the alien lunge forward together but kamens got the edge by a split second
he strikes a bright red switch and the overhead pressure bulkhead slams down and locks into place
his breathing is heavy as he slowly backs away from the hatch
the two aliens thomas killed must have been the scout party
others appear more cautiously this time
hurry up and figure that thing out man
guttierez is desperately trying to operate the tiny plastic microswitches on the headset with his fingernails
weve got company
thomas brings his weapon to bear and pulls on the trigger
he gets off one shot then nothing more happens
he looks at the counter on the side
it reads zero
shit im dry
de vries raises her rifle
she aims and
she works the manual slide
its locked solid
quick give me the clip
de vries fumbles the ammunition clip from her rifle
it falls from her hands onto a plastic overflow grate
thomas leaps after it
about a second too late
it slips through the narrow gap gone for good
hiroko enters her office at a run
she crosses to an inset control box on the far wall and presses a button
two exterior panels begin to slide closed behind the polycarbonate window
fracture lines appear on the toughened plastic as it comes under assault from the razor edge tip of an aliens tail
in shock hiroko reflexively falls backwards onto the floor scrambling away
she watches the creature precariously balancing on the this ledge outside fighting against the closing shutters with simultaneously raining repeated blows on the window with its tail
the alien leaps through the gap as the window gives way under the onslaught showering splinters across the room
the twin shutters secure behind it closing on the creatures tail in the process
it hisses in indignation and thrashes about
like a lizard the segmented tail snaps in two
the freed alien staggers a little before gaining balance blood dripping from the laceration and penetrating the wooden floorboards
it sights hiroko and hurls itself in her direction an unstoppable killing machine
her voice quavers so badly with fear and panic its a wonder the computer can recognize it
four ninja swordsmen promptly appear forming a semi circle between hiroko and the alien
the alien halts confused by this intrusion
it swipes at the pre programmed holograms bewildered by the lack of contact as its claws pass through them
gaining on a few seconds of bought time hiroko flings herself towards the predator spear lying forgotten nearby
the alien locks in on this sudden movement and charges through the holograms at her
hiroko grunts swinging the spear with her full strength
shes no super athlete but the cutting edges advanced metallurgy does the job
it slices half way through the aliens skull and sticks there spewing yellow fluid everywhere
hiroko beats a hasty retreat as the dying biomechanoid falls to the floor fumbling at the lodged weapon
hiroko reels into the outside corridor
she shrieks as her shoulders are seized from behind
hiroko looks at kamen confusedly as he continues along the corridor
thats the wrong way
other ways blocked
back outside the aliens have sensed that somethings amiss
de vries turns desperately to guttierez
you got any slugs left
guttierez looks down at the counter on his slung weapon
de vries rips the weapon off his shoulder
guttierez completes his sentence
de vries tries to make each shot count
she sights an alien crawling across the top of a group of cylindrical storage containers
draws a bead on the metal tank and fires
a molten ball explodes outward transforming the immediate vicinity into a blazing inferno
the aliens body twists end over end remaining immobile as it hits the deck
a curtain of fire ripples across the platform
their victory is short lived
the other aliens crawl cautiously forward flames licking their faces but leaving them unharmed
we can clearly hear the hissing of their internal jaws
try again man
the headset in guttierez hand bleeps as it turns into the correct channel
he yells into it
open these damn doors right now ill ream your ass so bad these things out herell seem like the easter bunny in comparison
swear to god
thomas turns and hammers on the impenetrable plate metal
open the doors
open the goddamned fucking doors
guttierez bullets are gone
the first of the aliens rushes at them
this is the end
de vries theres a blinding flash and most of the aliens head vaporises
guttierez blinks is disbelief as hazy shapes comprised of refracted fire suddenly occupy the killing ground between the human and alien antagonists
intense bursts of light illuminate the platform as hi tech predator weaponry far in advance of the humans sears the air
guttierez turns at the sound of the huge metal doors grinding slowly open
just enough for them to get through
thomas pushes de vries through the opening with guttierez hurriedly following
the auto shop is a large spacious workshop with three bays lining one wall
the front of a crawler pokes from one of them while in the center of the room another crawler is raised above a maintenance pit on a hydraulic platform
a handful of grease monkeys stands around the doorway brandishing power tools in lieu of firearms
a blonde surfer type with long straggly hair rushes over to them
this is matt their savior
close it up close it up
guttierez stares through the narrow opening as the doors seal back up
in the midst of the flames the aliens are fighting a pitched battle tooth and nail with their unseen opponents
its like a scene out of hell
clusters of rotating emergency lights wig wag above hiroko and kamen as they flee through the maze of long corridors leading to the command center
kamen is falling behind as they approach a junction
hurry it up
dont wait for me
hiroko and kamen race along the final corridor leading to the command center
halfway down kamen turns in response to a jarring sound from the rear
the metal grating making up the floor is smashed violently from beneath
the pandemonium from the outside corridors gets the attention of york and everybody else in admin
he crosses to the bulkhead doorframe and what he sees makes his eyes bug
he shouts back into the crowded room
theyre inside inside the corridor
hiroko and kamen try to outrun the tidal wave of twisted and broken steel that emerges in their wake
kamen yells with fright as an alien claw pinions his ankle
he trashes about clutching at anything to prevent himself being dragged beneath the floor
crying out is pain as slivers of edged metal slice into his hands
hiroko anguished no
york stands frozen at the bulkhead frame staring down the corridor in horror
cassie races up and pushes him out of the way
hiroko looks furiously around
spying an emergency axe in its wall housing she smashes the glass with her elbow cutting herself in the process
hiroko hefts the heavy tool swinging it down onto the disappearing aliens carapace with all her might
the blade bites deep and yellow blood bursts from the threshing aliens wound
speckles of it dot kamens leg eating through the material of his trousers and into the skin and muscle beneath
he screams a sound of pure intense pain
hiroko hurls the axe aside
she begins pulling kamen out of the hole as the caustic liquid seeps into the nearby electrical conduit
theres a sparking followed by a flash and a sheet of flame
cassie steps through into the corridor just as valves evenly spaced along the length of the tunnel open up jetting white high density foam under extreme pressure
the hatch to the command center at the far end begins to close
cassies head shoots around
york seizes a metal chair from behind a nearby console and wedges it into the narrowing divide
cassie squeezes through the gap and urgently hollers to hiroko
it you dont
move your ass youre gonna need a helluva diet to get through here
from cassies p
we watch hiroko supporting kamen and stumbling him along
foam fills three quarters of the corridor to their rear and is nearly up to their knees everywhere else
the chairs frame creaks ominously in protest
hurry up were losing it
cassies eyes widen in terror
hiroko turns to see the long phallic head of an alien emerge momentarily from out of the foam
something yanks at kamen and he disappears beneath the surface with an expression of pained surprise
hiroko starts to thrash at the foam but cassie reaches out and drags her away
its too late
the chair begins to buckle collapsing in on itself
with a supreme effort cassie yanks hiroko through the gap
york vaults clear as the chair snaps in two leaving the bulkhead to thunder closed
the two women collapse in a heap on the floor
the battle outside is going badly for the predators
theres only three of them left and one is broken tusk
a projectile whistles through the air towards an alien expanding in flight into a wire capture net
barbed tips on each corner bite into the wall of a base module trapping the enraged creature
small motors whine as the thin metal pulls inward slicing into the aliens body
the predator savors the scene for just a second
which is a second too long
aliens are all over him clawing and ripping at his body
the shoulder mounted plasma cannon is unceremoniously yanked away and clatters to the floor
the predator goes down groping for the self destruct system on his wrist
he manages to stroke a fingernail across the activation bar but gets no further
an alien pounces at him its tail descending
the predator raises his arm in reflex but the stinger smashes straight through the buries it in his face plate taking out the wrist computer in the process
hiroko stares at the closed bulkhead with an expression of dazed disbelief
he tries again
hiroko snaps out of it
she crosses over to the bank of monitoring screens
whats the story
parsons runs through each of the screens
everything on this module is locked and sealed
weve lost b c and e wings but e was the only one we didnt manage to totally evacuate
how many people are missing
unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far but the numbers are all over the place
whats our weapons situation
driscoll a big guy with a beard laughs curtly
our armorys a big blue box from the back shelf of stores
we got about two clips left for an autoloader and thats it
auto shops sealed but those boys are cut off
has anybody talked to them
broken tusk and the other predator scramble up onto the rooftop in a bid to escape their unstoppable opponents
back to back they take up fighting positions
a few seconds later the first of the aliens arrives
both the predators shoulder cannons blaze firing volley after volley
still the aliens keep on coming finally reaching the point where its hand to hand
and nothing else
its a vicious fast and bloody on both sides
broken tusk takes flight his companion is not as lucky
the other predator kicks an alien from him and over the roofs edge
the alien lashes out with lightning fast reflexes pulling the predator with it
both creatures hurtle downward and hit a nest of cabling stretched across from one of the modules
caught like flies in a spiders web
both thrash about severing cables as they do
electrical sparks crackle through the air
everything electrical in the command center flickers momentarily and the bank of monitors turn to static
theres an instant of silence collective concerns amongst those gathered there
what the hell
dont panic people
weve just switched over to internals
they knocked out the external feeds
looks like it
thirty six hours
give or take
were not gonna make it are we
get the auto shop on line
parsons shakes his head
communications to auto shop go through an f
link off the main trunk
thats down with the other feeds
try the headset
spirits are low in the auto shop
im tellin you its impossible
nothing can grow and reproduce this fast
you wanna go outside and tell them that
whats keeping those fucking marines man
they shoulda been here by now
thomas lashes out at an empty can kicking it noisily across the floor
maybe they aint coming
maybe they dont even know weve got problems
i dont wanna hear that kind of crap thomas
just a matter of time thats all
guttierez headset lies nearby
parsons muted voice comes out of it
one of the grease monkeys snatches it up and listens
jan its hiroko
what sort of shape are you in down there
on speaker pretty damn good shape considering
you can tell don kamen from me his people have got balls of steel
kamen didnt make it jan
theres a pregnant pause from the speakers
on speakers yeah
were still here
all sorry to hear that
can you make it back
on speakers uh
id say that was a negative
if we open the doors those things are gonna swarm inside
theres another problem too
on speakers de vries put a round through the storage tanks over by the west pier on the way in here
right now the stuff sprayin out is just burnin up but if we get a blow back a good part of the station could go with it
alright lets keep calm
weve got to have an option of some sort
theres got to be a way out of this
yorks kept quiet but everyone turns to him now
his tone is scathing and cuts to the marrow
well what about those other things outside those warriors
maybe we can cut some kind of deal
york looks around at them in incredulous disbelief
matt walks nervously around holding the headset
everybodys eyes are on him
well it occurred to me that we could use the overhead crane to load the admin module onto the back of big bertha
that way we could put a bit of distance
matt contd o
on speakers between us and the station
least till the guys from fort powell arrive
that sounds promising
can we operate the crane from here
its got programmable facilities but it was never rigged for remote operation
someoned have to go up to the cab to get it up and running
which mean physically going outside
driscoll looks around uneasily
a small group of people most of whom we saw in the command center are clustered around a section of the poorly lit maintenance corridor
hirokos wearing a black hi tech catsuit a fetishists dream
across her shoulder is a pistol in a slung bandolier holster
she nods at a pile of clothing in driscolls hands
is this the suit
she takes it from him
slides her legs into the bottom half and pulls it up
york watches with an expression of incredulity etched on his face
this is fuckin lunacy
youre not gonna make it across the platform on foot
shut up york
no hes right
has anyone got a bike near here
a redheaded girl looks around hesitantly then raises her voice
let me have the keys
the girl rummages in her pockets and throws the keys over
hiroko puts them in a pocket on the suits sleeve
which one is it
the hyundai racer
yellow and black stripes
listen i dont care if its pink and purple polka dots as long as it gets me there in one piece
somebody loan me a headset
cassie pulls off hers and hands it over
driscolls watching hiroko fasten up the suit
he spots a mistake
no go back
second clasp from the bottom
hiroko finds the offending clasp and locks it
how much air time have i got
about thirty minutes
those are slimmed down tanks so no stopping to admire the scenery
weve dumped the whole data base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet
itll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go
yeah i stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick ups too
thats also on the display
its not all good news
we had to take off the helmet lights
youll be going in blind
we had to
they were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits youre gonna have to negotiate
besides all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where i doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference anyway
maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick
how tight are these shafts
cassie and driscoll exchange worried looks
we chose a route we felt would reduce the chance of you running into any aliens
hiroko takes a deep breath
beads of perspiration dot her forehead
theres still time to back out
i wouldnt ask somebody to do something i wouldnt do myself
wheres the disk
parsons hands over a vinyl wrapped packet
dont lose it
hiroko slips it into a breast pocket and secures the flap
driscoll hands several metallic objects to hiroko
if you got to use em make em count
theyre magazines for her gun
she slots them into the bandolier
lets just run through it one more time so i know youve got it straight
okay i pull the access panel off of the console
insert the disk and press the green enabling button
parsons interrupting no
theres two of them
she pulls on the zip and begins locking the harness clasps into place
two green enabling buttons
when youve done that dont waste any time getting out of there
once that crane starts moving
well its bound to provoke some kind of response
york hands over a sophisticated looking power tool
youll need this for the gratings
trigger finger to operate thumb button to switch over to the rivet gun
the sensorsll choose blade or socket heads automatically
long beat okay im set
york and driscoll lower the massive dome fronted helmet over hirokos head
auto clasps lock into place as it brackets with the collar
parsons clips the slimline air tank to her back and driscoll makes the connections
alright lets open her up
cassie and the others hold their weapons and motion trackers steadily at a fixed point on the ground
two onlookers bend down to the pressure hatch beneath the floor grating
its identical to the one diller and urioste removed earlier
a plume of pressurised gas jets into the air and they pull the metal sealing plug free
cassie scrutinizes her tracker
hiroko reaches up to her helmet and presses a chunky button on one side
were looking through the transparent bowl of the helmet at the open shaft braken water sloshing around its rim
superimposed lines of glowing neon appear on the visors surface a precisely overlaid duplication of the scene in computer graphic form
a flatly synthesised male computer voice comes over the helmet speakers o
computer voice o
on speakers approaching a module lower level venturiduct ds oh four
hiroko gets down on her hands and knees and crawls towards the opening
she stares at the murky water with mounting apprehension
tries to reassure herself
she looks around at the impassive staring faces
summoning up her courage she submerges the helmet
the pale illumination of the lower level deck lights gives way to absolute nothingness a stygian nightmare
she shudders with horror and pulls her head free
she wipes frenetically at the slickly coated visor breathing heavily
worried hands grab her
are you alright
what is it
hirokos eyes dart around speaking volumes
she swallows hard and calms down
steeling herself she takes a deep breath and plunges headfirst into the water once more
everything goes to blackness again
the head up display presents a view of the unseen tunnel in cheerful candy apple hues
computer voice o
on speakers entering venturi duct en route to secondary overflow sump ds oh four slash eleven
york watches hirokos feet disappear into the shaft
the heavy sealing plug is dragged across the grating and positioned over the hole
york shakes his head
suicide run man
fuckin suicide run
cassie wasnt kidding about the venturi duct
its only about half again as wide as hiroko
the only illumination comes from the hazy circle above
as the plug reseals the hole even thats gone
two weak fluorescent tubes come on lighting the murk with a faint orange haze
on speakers all the comforts of home
on speakers dont mention it
she inches her way through the narrow space towards us breathing heavily
the clicking of the motion tracker in her helmet is overwhelming in the silence
the stations massive antenna array is being transformed
otherworldly shapes comprised of surreal creatures and protrusions are starting to cover its surface
aliens drop from dizzying heights exuding streams of gelatinous gunk from the four exhaust pipes on their backs
theyre building a nest of staggering proportions
unnoticed by the busy biomechanoids faint sparks flicker from the crane catwalk high above
broken tusk sits on the catwalk floor a small shower of sparks lighting his face
hes attempting to repair his broken wrist computer with an intricate tool
he removes it and presses a switch
the display glows briefly then fades
he inserts it again
electrical sparks crackle across the computers fascia before burning out
broken tusk throws the ruined machine away in disgust
from our p
high up near the roof of the auto shop we see thomas sitting on the raised hydraulic platform
he grunts as he pulls a valve on the crawlers underside
across the room the second crawler rumbles out of the far bay
one of the grease monkeys walks slowly backwards waving it on
little bit more
he steps into a pool of slippery residue and loses his footing
the man crouches and runs a finger through the colorless goo on the floor
scowls first then frowns
over near the doors matt exhales deeply on a cigarette
de vries is nearby listening attentively as guttierez gets a message on his helmet
she just set off
matt claps his hands together just once to get everybodys attention
theres a scream from behind
they wheel around in time to see the grease monkey being tugged into the maintenance opening
thomas yells down from the platform
theyre comin up through the pit
a box with two large buttons one green one red dangles from the ceiling on the end of a cable
matt forces down the red control making the platform lower
several tons of machinery and crawler bring about the demise of the aliens as they reach the lip of the opening crushing their chitinous limbs to smithereens
an alien rolls out of the pit in time scrambling for the safety of the nearby shadows
de vries sights it
one of the men has seen it
his head snaps up to a mammoth engine block suspended from a winch high above
he leaps for the release catch as the alien passes underneath
pulls hard on the grip
chains rattle noisily as the block thunders down
the alien begins to look up just a second too late
the heavy piece of machinery smashes into the creature flattening it instantly
unseen by anybody another alien has escaped to the roof of the platform bound crawler
it wraps its long bony fingers around the face of the man stifling his cries and pulling him off the deck
the loud clattering of his chainsaw bouncing off the floor grating gets thomas attention
thomas retrieves the fallen tool and jams the on switch hard
the aliens tongue shoots through the grease monkeys skull showering thomas with a faint speckling of blood
the alien discards the body and lunges at thomas who counters bringing the chainsaw up
the blade slices into the creatures throat and up through its head
thomas draws out the chainsaw quickly
something happens to the pitch of the blade a peculiar sound
the acid eats through the links of the chainsaw band
like a metallic snake it whips off its supporting frame
straight at thomas
hiroko elbows her way further through the cramped water filled duct
a wide grille directly in her path blocks further headway
green neon flashes in her display with accompanying notations
computer voice o
on speakers progress to secondary overflow sump ds oh four slash eleven impeded
grating must be removed to facilitate entry
hiroko into headset okay im at the first access grate
cassies voice is a little less clear now with traces of static drifting in
on speakers copy that
be careful now
she places the tip of her power tool over the first of the grilles anchoring bolts
the complex mechanism whines as it selects the correct wrench tip for the job
parsons races up to the girl manning the communication console
what is it
thomas is laid out in the back seat of the crawlers cab with de vries and matt trying to staunch the wounds from the chainsaw bands impact to his chest
guttierez speaks into his headset mike
we got problems
the grille in knocked out of its housing and floats lazily off into the water
hiroko passes through the newly created hole
she finds herself in an upright cylindrical chamber about five feet in height
massive extractor fans churn dangerously where both the floor and ceiling ought to be
kicking up a swirl of particles
pale blue light filters down from above
computer voice o
on speakers caution
entering secondary overflow sump ds oh four slash eleven
grating must be removed to facilitate entry to central reservoir
hiroko annoyed yeah yeah yeah
with difficulty she straddles the floor turbine
a vortex of water swirls around her as she brings the power tool up once more
parsons listens attentively
he clicks his fingers at cassie
where is she
comin up the central reservoir
run a trace on the culvert leading off the auto shop maintenance pit
cassies all business immediately calling up the base floor plan files on a monitor
parsons contd into headset is thomas gonna make it
on speakers uh
difficult to say
guttierez looks on as matt ties off a bandage
the chainsaw band might have punctured his lungs
cassie looks up worriedly
i found it
drains right into the central reservoir
get her on line
hirokos pulls her third bolt free
it drifts slowly downward slipping between the vanes of the floor turbine
a fragmented voice comes through on her headset distorted beyond recognition
hirokos forehead knits together in concentration and annoyance
what was that
i dont copy
the routine sound of the motion tracker changes suddenly
hiroko turns her attention from the task in hand to study the trackers helmet readout
three nebulous blobs have appeared from off screen
heading straight for her position
cassie turns to parsons in frustration
i cant reach her
too much signal break up
the signals pick up speed the closer they get
cassies garbled voice isnt helping ease hirokos panic
she looks wildly around the chamber
the only way out the way she came in
computer voice o
on speakers attention
removal of restraining bolts it necessary to facilitate access to
hiroko stabs the exterior helmet control
the computer voice ceases while the beeping from the tracker rises in both pitch and volume
whatever the signals are theyre almost on top of her
hiroko turns to the narrow entry duct
its position makes it virtually impossible to get back into
she tries anyhow
a rush of displaced water flood into the chamber flattening her against the wall
dark shapes thunder past the other side of the grille like express trains in the night
going away from hiroko
she twitches in fear and disbelief as the blobs on the monitor screen recede and finally disappear
the trackers pitch returns to its hollow clicking
broken tusk tries to be as unobtrusive as possible as he picks through the aftermath of the battle down by the now empty rhino pen
he finds something
a predator face mask with a massive crack down one side
he turns it carefully over in his hands
hiroko emerges from the water a thin membrane of surface slime adhering to her helmet
blinded she raises a gloved hand and wipes the mucus away
shes inside the central reservoir a long cylindrical concrete tunnel some eighteen feet in diameter
the water level comes up about half way
what fills the remainder freezes her with revulsion
shes found the main offshoot of the aliens nest
glued into the curved walls by a secretive resin as bodies
humans rhinos lemurs
most are dead their innards blown open
the rest are comatose twitching occasionally
every square inch not containing bodies is filled with alien eggs
its like hell for real
hiroko reaches slowly up and reactivates her helmet readout
computer voice o
on speakers brrzzt
traversing central reservoir en route to platform venturi dust ds two six
she looks around and finds the exit point on the display
its several feet away
under the surface
she wades swiftly through the water passing beneath something that gives her cause to pause
a large pulsating bag about ten feet long and roughly ovular in shape
it might be translucent but in this light its hard to tell
sure enough theres the grille
she raises the power tool and starts extracting the bolts
theres the first one no problem
the second and third are just as easy
she goes for the fourth
she bears down on the trigger again
the motors not running
a tiny green led flashes on the machines side
its locked solid
computer voice o
on speakers attention
removal of restraining bolts is necessary to facilitate access to venturi ducts
theres only one recourse left to her
she jams down the thumb button
the force of the rivet gun propels her backwards her internal suit pressure making her rise to the surface
she wipes the slime from her helmet yet again
and finds herself staring at an alien egg its top cracking open in four neat sections
the facehugger leaps straight as her faceplate
and misses its fingers failing to gain purchase on the slippery dome
hiroko kicks away from the spindly creature as it orientates itself on the waters surface its powerful tail propelling itself back toward her
it contracts on itself preparing to leap
hiroko raises the power tool reflexively squeezing the trigger again and again
fat rivets rip through the facehuggers body
it writhes around on the waters surface a cloud ofyellow acid billowing outward from it
hiroko dives into the water again
she rams the power tool at the final bolt
she levers off the grille
forces herself into the confined space beyond
another poorly lit shaft filled with murky water though this one goes upwards on a diagonal slope
hiroko braces herself against the walls and begins to climb
computer voice o
on speaker traversing venturi duct en route to platform surface
an aliens head squeezes through the opening behind her
its claw snakes in groping blindly just inches from her feet
she grits her teeth and puts more effort into her ascent
its hand closes around her leg yanking her back
she tries frantically to gain purchase on anything
the alien draws her nearer its other hand closing on the helmets visor
fracture lines appear on the glass followed by cracks
polluted water starts to flood in while air bubbles expand outward from the broken glass
hiroko drives the power tool at the alien and mashes the trigger
rivets penetrate the creatures endoskeleton making it draw back
a haze of yellow blood spills out into the duct
hiroko pushes upward coughing
she closes her fist around a lever above
pulls on it with all her might
internal pressure forces the metallic plug out like a champagne cork
it hits the platform with a loud clunk
hiroko hauls herself from the shaft trailing a cloud of smoke as the acid eats into her suit
she throws the helmet to the ground shattering the visor
yanks desperately at the suits release clamps kicking the ruined garment off
as promised the yellow and black hoverbike is nearby
hiroko starts towards it then remembers the keys are in the sleeve pocket of the ruined pressure suit
she drops to he knees and gingerly pokes through the smoking pile of cloth
finds the flap rips it open and withdraws the keys
a glistening wet claw emerges from the open hole
hiroko scrambles to her feet as the injured alien pulls itself out
she tears across to the bike and rams the key into the ignition
the turbines roar to life and it lifts smoothly into the air
hiroko pivots the powerful machine around avoiding the creatures questing grasp
losing its balance the alien smashes into the deck
hirokos guns the bike away speeding along the platform
the fire over by the auto shop rages out of control a column of black and orange smoke rising into the air
a dark form hurls itself at her from an overhead cable support
yet another alien
it lands awkwardly on the protruding front cowl of the hoverbike gaining balance in an instant
hiroko twists on her controls trying to dislodge the creature by see sawing the bike side to side
the aliens got a firm hold though crawling hand over hand towards her
hiroko releases her grip on both throttles simultaneously
air brakes cut in and the bike slams to a halt
the breath whooshes out of hiroko as her chest impacts with the surrounding roll bar
the alien is even less fortunate momentum hurls it back onto the concrete
hiroko guns the engine again and the leading edge of the manta shaped machines aerofoil catches the rising creature neatly decapitating it
the hoverbike growls to a halt by the base of the crane
hiroko dismounts and draws her pistol
takes in the sheer height of the ladder shes going to have to scale
thumbs her headset
okay i make it to the crane
everybody in admin registers astonishment as her voice comes over the speakers
hiroko contd o
on speakers can all uncross your fingers
a whoop goes up
various hands are slapped
we copy boss
hirokos climbing the ladder
she stops to catch her breath
yeah well dont get too carried away were only halfway home
hiroko contd o
on speakers to you shortly
parsons clicks his fingers to driscoll
driscoll youre up
driscolls moving even as parsons speaks
i hear you
hiroko reaches the top and sprints along the catwalk towards the control cab
she narrowly misses something metallic near the base of the handrail
if shed taken the time to stop and look she would have seen broken tusks ruined wrist computer
driscoll flips open an access flap on one wall of the ladder well
printed on the inside is a set of instructions with the following printed boldly in red he traces his finger along a line of text
hiroko enters the cab at a run
she flips a row of switches and the control board comes to life
she finds it
gets her fingers in the groove and slides it out
beneath is a mini disk drive with two buttons
she pulls the vinyl wrapped packet from her catsuit pocket
carefully withdraws the disk and slides it home
thumbs the first button which glows an emerald green
the boards flatscreen monitor lights up immediately
hiroko studies it for a moment then presses her headset link
okay were in business
auto shop you all set
everybody from auto shop is crammed into the two articulated vehicles
guttierez sits in the drivers seat of the first crawler
he glances out of the side window
matt gives him a thumbs up from the cab of the second crawler
guttierez into headset say the word and you wont see our asses for dust
hiroko wipes a trickle of sweat from her forehead
she poises her finger over the second drive button
here we go
everybody in admin looks tense
hiroko contd o
on speakers three
guttierez leans forward
hiroko contd o
on headset two
hiroko blinks as the sweat drains into her eyes
she stabs the drive switch
smoothly maintained engineering comes to life
the enormous yellow crane starts to move on its track rails
the control board monitor is suddenly awash with information and schematics
okay im out of here
blow those suckers driscoll
driscoll raises a black device shaped like a cylinder with a handgrip on the end
slots it into the mechanism beneath the flap and carefully turns it
a tiny red led comes on
complex mechanical assemblies attach the module to its supporting pier platforms
there are a number of loud bangs similar to car engines misfiring
explosive bolts release the tethers
driscoll reports into his headset
hiroko runs back across the catwalk
she might have missed the predators damaged computer before but she doesnt this time
her foot comes down on it and she slips
the gun goes flying from her hand
hiroko watches in horror as it teeters on the catwalks edge for a moment
then goes over
she drops to all fours and peers over the side
luckily its only fallen about four feet onto a dirty ledge
she reaches out for it
guttierez pushes forward on the crawlers controls
the head up display projected on the cab windscreen changes from neutral to the two crawlers tear out of the auto shops opening doors headlights blazing
guttierez braces himself as they speed on a collision course towards the ditched crawler they left outside auto shop earlier
guttierez crawler rams the other vehicle off the roadway and through the platform safety barrier
it balances precariously for a second until finally its weight sends it plunging into the swamp in a cacophony of stressed metal and crumbling concrete
demolition derby baby
holding the cracked mask to his face broken tusk looks up at the gigantic crane moving against the night sky
although the helmets nightsight is malfunctioning its still good enough to register the hot infra red shape of hiroko on the catwalk
the sound of the two crawlers hurtling across the platform gets broken tusks attention
hiroko gets a firm grasp on one of the railing rungs anchoring herself
stretches for the pistol with renewed determination
she brushes the barrel
not good enough
her fingers curl around the weapon and she tugs it upwards
the two crawlers plunge into the curtain of flames spreading across the platform
de vries yells at guttierez over the roar of the flames
hotter n hell out there
hiroko leaps the last few rungs from the moving crane onto the platform
she dashes towards the hoverbike some thirty feet away
with no time to loose she slides her boots into the foot supports which automatically whirr closed
gropes for the ignition key
before shes even located it the hoverbike moves
scraping across the concrete
alien claws appear around the edge of one of the bikes manta wings
shes parked the bike over a drainage exit
hiroko spins the key and guns the engine
the white hot downblast from the turbine exhaust splashes across the screeching aliens
the vehicle tilts and kicks forward
the two crawlers emerge from the conflagration scorched and trailing fire
in the background the crane hoist centers over the admin module
looking straight down
four lasers scan quickly around the modules edges
a blinking message on the cranes monitor screen the sound of shredding metal makes hiroko look down
an alien is hanging on the underside of the bike
she twists the throttle reducing acceleration and causing the vehicle to drop several inches
sparks shower the ground from where the creature makes contact with the roadway
the aliens determination is astounding
its tail slams up through the alloy wing anchoring it
the biomechanoid starts to pulls itself up shifting the bikes center of gravity
she fights the controls but finds herself swerving
one handed she takes aim
she misses the alien rupturing a fuel pipe instead
the cranes clamping mechanism closes around the admin module locking into place
everybody reacts as the sound penetrates through the walls and echoes around admin
hold on tight
the crane hoists the module aloft free of its umbilicals
pencils disposable cups and anything else not bolted down all roll from table tops
most are grabbed by their owners
hirokos bike veers blindly around the corner of a building with hiroko still shooting
she looks up and her eyes widen
ahead is the out of control blaze
a tongue of flame licks out across the platform directly in her path
hiroko slides the gun quickly into her shoulder holster and ducks for cover behind the bikes windshield
the aliens head twists around and they plunge into the inferno
the liquid from the breached pipe ignites trailing a plume of yellow flame
hiroko jams down on the foot release and wrenches the steering bar hard to the right
she leaps for safety as the burning bike with its alien passenger crashes through the stations safety rail and plummets into the swamp
the two crawlers thunder down the ramp
guttierez vehicle pulls into a tight right turn while matts continues on its course
the crane with its underslug module continues to rumble slowly forward
hiroko mechanically tries to get up from the concrete roadway
she looks down at the back of her left hand
the skin has been scraped away
a distant noise something else being broken
through the conflagration aliens are advancing
guttierez smoldering crawler pulls up alongside big berthas titanic wheels
guttierez turns his head to one of the guys in the rear
take the wheel roy
guttierez and de vries exit the crawler in a big hurry
the moment theyre clear the vehicle starts up and is gone
de vries is alert the tip of her rifle probing their surroundings
lets shag it
guttierez begins climbing the tall ladder running up to the berthas cab
hirokos running along the platform pistol clenched firmly in hand
she thumbs her headset
rob its hiroko
cassie answers holding on to the edge of her console
hiroko its cassie
hirokos voice interrupts
on speakers ive lost the bike and im cut off
hiroko spins around the corner pointing her gun cop stance
if i can get to the chopper ill meet you at the rendezvous
dont wait for me
the heli jet pads just up ahead
the relief on hirokos face is enormous
just do it
guttierez and de vries pile inside the surprisingly cramped drivers cab
theres a seat up front with another behind a small control fascia pointing out back
de vries hands over her rifle and slides into the rear
she flicks on an overhead light
taped to one side is a black and white magazine cut out of a naked male body builder
she gives the control board a cursory once over
guttierez calls back from his vantage point at the doorway
can you handle it
de vries powers up the console
piece of cake
hiroko runs towards the waiting heli jet
the flicker of an andrenalin fueled smile plays on her face
like a scorpion scuttling over a rock the alien climbs up on top of the grounded machine
its head turn towards her
hiroko starts to raise her pistol
other aliens are descending the nearby navigation tower
straight for her
hiroko turns tail
she races over to a ladder running up the side of a building and begins to climb
the shadow of the crane and its cargo falls over big berthas rear flatbed
flashing warning strobes illuminate the twin hydraulic arms which rise up to meet it
de vries twists on the waldo controls operating the manipulator hands
aliens rise up out of the swamp below and start to scale berthas balloon tires
guttierez fires a barrage down at the oncoming creatures
he hollers back to de vries
move it baby or theyre gonna be chewin on my cojones
couple more seconds
hiroko takes flight across the rooftops with the aliens in pursuit like a pack of dogs
she vaults extractor intakes and retrofitted junk with ease
so do the aliens
she cuts across a conduit overpass bridging two buildings across the main street trying not to lose her footing
just before reaching the other side hiroko slips and falls to her knees
her headset drops thirty feet onto the concrete roadway
her hand rests on something red
its the cover for the explosive bolts connecting the conduit to the building
she scrambles onto the rooftop and flips over the hatch
the aliens are already starting across
she pulls the primer cylinder out by its handle
jams it into the detonator and turns
shes practically on top of the bolts
the explosion is deafening
with the clamp on this side free the conduit falls into the street with a screech of twisted metal
one of the aliens is pulverized by the falling debris but the others survive
all hirokos managed to do is buy herself some breathing space
she races across the buildings roof
reaches the other side
straight into a dead end
the admin module locks onto berthas manipulator arms with a satisfying clunk
autocouplers slot into place and the crane releases its load
the connecting jolt is even greater then before
several larger objects crash to the deck
weve got it
get us out of here
guttierez looses one last volley at the aliens
he pulls the cab door shut and throws himself into the drivers seat
do your stuff
berthas wheels grind to life spilling aliens and crushing them under its treads
its a straight drop thirty feet onto concrete with no ladders or any other way down
she looks desperately around for another avenue of escape
the leering face of an alien comes up over the roofs edge
hiroko swings her pistol over and fires
it falls away
only to be replaced seconds later by two others
her gun goes dry
quick as a flash she ejects the spent magazine
she slaps the spare in and continues firing
big berthas heading away from the base into the surrounding trees
guttierez grits his teeth as they plunge towards the high branches
de vries hits the floor
the thick boughs impact with the cab shattering the safety glass
hirokos guns empty
she reaches for another clip on her bandolier
then realises that was her last one
the encircling aliens hiss triumphantly and close in
with no place to go and no means of defending herself hirokos a goner
the lead aliens lethal double barrel teeth open
its almost on her
the aliens face is severed in half
a circular metal object blurs through the air and loops back on itself almost faster then the human eye can follow
a massive form slams down in front of hiroko pushing her out of the way
she hits the deck hard and gasps
broken tusk is standing before her
he skillfully catches the frisbee like smart weapon then throws it again
hiroko watches with awe as the predator joins battle against the aliens
hissing alien jaws are silenced by broken tusks formidable fighting technique
questing limbs are blasted and hacked away by advanced predator weaponry
acidic blood flows freely
the skirmish is surprisingly brief
broken tusk and hiroko stare at one another
broken tusk pulls a slung metal rod from his shoulder
two barbed tips schnick outwards forming a spear
the predator looks at her and his lip curls
it takes a second for hiroko to realise hes offering it to her
bewildered she accepts it pulling herself up
a bright orange ball of flame mushrooms up behind getting both of their attentions
broken tusk regards her
his mandibles click clack nervously
dont take this the wrong way but when i imagined the cavalry coming to my rescue
they never looked like you
the predator turns away seemingly uninterested
another gout of flame belches out of the churning mass in the middle of the station
hiroko turns her recovered headset over in her hands
she throws it aside
broken tusk stands beside her keeping guard
another detonation goes off behind even louder
re gonna have to close the book on this place
she slaps broken tusk on the arm
come on butch
she begins to walk away
broken tusk crosses to the safety barrier peering over the side
i said come on
the predator turns a deaf ear to her
he gauges the distance below then throws himself off the platforms edge
she races across to the rail and gazes downward
the predator wades through the swamp towards something she cannot see
hiroko looks around the platform
shes suddenly very alone
she crosses to a maintenance ladder and begins to descend
hiroko splashes through the swamp towards the predator
broken tusk has paused before a culvert nestled within the shadows of the platform piers running directly out into the swamp
most of the drain is underwater with only about eight inches protruding from the water
the thick metal grille covering it is mangled and twisted
broken from within
youve got to be joking
no way am i going back in there
broken tusk starts submerging to get across inside
broken tusk pauses for a moment
he gives her a look then disappears into the blackness
hiroko looks around
its no fun being the last person left alive here
she takes several deep breaths then reluctantly follows
hiroko emerges within an air pocket inside the drain
its just as dirty and cramped as she remembers
several of the maintenance lights down here are broken and visibility is minimal
hiroko contd quietly wha
broken tusk whirls and clamps a hand across her mouth
she gets the message
they exit the culvert through another smashed grate
hiroko finds herself back in the central reservoir again
she wades through the water behind broken tusk holding the spear above her head
the two of them look very vulnerable in here
they pass beneath the pulsating sac hiroko saw earlier
it looks riper now ready to burst
an insidious pulsing noise like a heartbeat gains in volume the further they travel
they come out in a chamber some forty feet in height and dominated by an enormous pump
alien gunk covers everything
high above it a queen alien nesting on top of the vast mechanism
its egg sac drapes around the pump spiraling down around it
she seems to be asleep
broken tusk ignores the queen
his eyes are searching the multitude of forms human and otherwise cocooned into the walls
he finds what hes looking for
up on one wall is another predator
its stomach blown open
hiroko holds her spear tightly
facehuggers pulse malignantly wrapped around several trapped victims
a number of empty eggs are scattered here and there
broken tusk looks around
he begins climbing the organic fresco watching the queen alien carefully for signs of awareness
the bellows like sound of her breathing is overwhelming
he reaches the entrapped predator
its left arm is encased in a solidified mass of secreted resin
broken tusk raises his smart weapon and activates it
the splintering noise makes hiroko wince
she glances up at the queen
its breathing start to change and its head moves
broken tusk sees it too
he hesitates for a moment
the queen settles and her breathing goes back to normal
broken tusk resumes his work chipping off the final chunk of coating
he sheathes the smart weapon and flips open the other predators wrist device
he withdraws the small manipulator device we saw earlier and goes to work
down below hirokos backing away
she doesnt see the arm coated in slime that grasps at her hair
she shudders stifling a scream
her eyes are wide as she turns
hes been embedded into the biomechanical frieze
when he speaks his voice is wracked with pain and suffering
hiroko fearfully says something beneath her breath in japanese
up on the wall broken tusk has finished his task
he slides the tip of a claw across the self destruct mechanism
its readout display illuminates with alien characters
he activates a button and the readout begins to blink
below kamen is talking to a sickened hiroko
they snapped my legs to fit
fit me in here
remember what happened next
what can i do
feel it moving around inside me
youve got to kill me
you have to
broken tusk appears as hirokos shoulder
he raises his right arm
the wrist knives slice outwards
red blood spatters hirokos pale face
broken tusk grabs her arm roughly and pulls her away
broken tusk pushes hiroko through the reservoir
an alien egg on a nearby wall peels open
before the facehugger even has a chance to spring broken tusk swings his wrist blades in a wide arc cutting through the egg and its writhing contents
the two of them reach the deep end and have to wade
hiroko pushes herself along the biomechanical outcropping
ahead of them is the pulsing sac
before theyre even passed beneath it they hear something
a sound like water filled balloons hitting wet concrete
the sac ruptures spattering thick gloopy matter
a form comprised of slender limbs emerges from within
an immature queen alien
though just born its reflexes are razor sharp
it lashes out at hiroko and broken tusk
hiroko ducks and the queens claws embed themselves in broken tusks shoulder destroying his automatic cannon
a vast explosion rips through the base broiling clouds of flame rolling across the platform and seeping into the drainage ducts
columns of fire jet from fissures and openings inside the pump chamber rippling across the adult queen alien and her hapless victims
she begins to scream flailing around atop her metal throne
the adult queens shriek echoes through the reservoir accompanied by a ball of fire that travels part of the way down
the immature queen turns her head in reply answering with her own yowl
broken tusk hisses with hate and brings his smart weapon slicing down through her arm severing it at the wrist
hiroko simultanesouly drives her spear into the aliens chest
she grabs the injured predator and pulls him away from the thrashing creature
the alien numbers on the predator self destruct readout inexorably count down
the metal plug hiroko blew during her earlier escape still lies to one side of the duct hiroko and broken tusk crawl hastily out of
fireballs are erupting all around now making their situation precarious
from a vantage point high above we see hiroko and broken tusk racing across the platform towards the heli jet pad
broken tusk stumbles and falls
hiroko bends down to help him up but the predator shoves her away
he doesnt want her assistance
if you dont move your ugly butt were gonna end up barbecued
hiroko runs towards the waiting heli jet with the predator close behind
the landing pad is made up of an intricate series of grilles designed to deflect downward exhaust gases
hirokos feet clatter across the metal
the metal is smashed from beneath right in front of her
the immature alien queen has made is out of the sewer system and has got the jump on them
hirokos forward momentum wont allow her to stop running
shes too close
almost at the last moment she jumps
claws brush her trouser leg but close on thin air
she hits the deck and quickly closes the last few feet to the chopper
broken tusk stops
aliens are appearing all over the pad and out of nearby drainage ducts
hiroko slips into the choppers pilot seat
she flips a bunch of switches and the turbines rise in volume from a low whine to a dull an orange ball of flame mushrooms up behind broken tusk
with the aliens blocking his path theres no refuge for him
the navigation tower looms overhead nearby
broken tusk takes a calculated risk and leaps for it
the heli jet flies pretty much like a standard helicopter
hiroko pulls back on the collective and the turbines pitch changes from a throaty growl to a high pitched whine
the heli jet rises a little unsteadily
the wash from the turbines plays across the shrieking aliens
through the canopy dome we see broken tusk climbing the navigation tower with the aliens close behind
i can play cavalry too
broken tusk scales the ladder as quickly as he can
as the top of the tower is a gallery catwalk surrounding the flashing beacon array
the immature queen accompanied by a phalanx of warrior aliens is almost upon him
the predator drives his wrist knives into the throat of a grasping alien which falls downward writhing
it crashes into the queen who almost loses her grip on the skeletal metalwork
she hisses lashing out at the creature
sends it hurtling to the ground
broken tusk makes it to the top
theres not much space on the catwalk to maneuver
he looks around then down
this is his last stand
instinctively he reaches down to his wrist for the self destruct computer
of course its not there
the third row of digits on the alien destruct mechanism disappear
times running out
broken tusk smashes his foot hard into the face of an alien
a blast of displaced air hits him like a sledgehammer
hirokos heli jet hovers stationary just a few feet away from the tower the door on the co pilots side flapping open
she hollers at the predator over the roar of the engines
broken tusk looks down
its a long drop
but its the best option available to him
his hands grip the door frame
the heli jet wobbles slightly its center of gravity shifting
broken tusk hauls himself up and through the door as
a massive explosion mushrooms up from the base as the storage tanks below ignite
the shock wave buffets the chopper against the tower
broken tusks p
the grinning face of the young queen gets suddenly closer as the heli jet is propelled towards the metal structure
the chopper hits knocking several aliens from their handholds
one of the queens arms shoots out wrapping itself around the port engine mount
hiroko pushes on the stick
the heli jet pulls away
then tilts violently to one side engines desperately trying to compensate
the queen is hanging from the beleaguered craft its weight drawing it slowly down
in the background the navigation tower begins to slowly collapse
hiroko wrestles the overtaxed controls
broken tusk turns towards her
in the back
in the back
the predator may not understand her words but he can follow the frantic jerking of her hand
he twists around to look in the choppers rear
hiroko pilots the heli jet over the stations storage tanks
the conflagration below has gotten completely out of hand
the queen is starting to struggle up its arms flailing for purchase
broken tusk pulls out a pulse rifle from the rear
he quickly takes stock of it
watch your shots
if you hit the engine youll blow us both to hell
broken tusk goes for the trigger
his index finger wont slide into the trigger guard
its too big
he takes the guard in both hands and exerts pressure
theres only one set of digits left on the destruct devices display counter
a red dot of light runs across the queens head
she must sense it somehow
her head comes round to bear
broken tusks got the pulse rifle trained right on her
a round open a nice neat hole in the queens head
a second round does the job
the queen relinquishes her grip and falls screeching all the way down into the raging inferno below
the last segment of the destruct mechanisms display disappears
we hear a hiroko throws the joystick forward
the heli jet accelerates hell for leather away
an incandescent ball of energy expands outward vaporising the station and most of the surrounding bayou for about a miles radius
big berthas parked by the blinking blue beacon tower site of the ill fated hunting expedition
about a dozen or so people are milling around smoking cigarettes or talking
matt and de vries are leaning against the wheels of matts crawler
they feel the concussive shock wave and look upward
above the treetops a blinding white light blurs out the horizon
gauges and other instruments are going crazy as the heli jet rides the turbulence out
a chunk of metal is propelled through the air and rips into the choppers starboard engine
theres a burst of flame then the extinguishers cut in
the heli jets bucking like a bronco now and theyre losing height rapidly
weve lost the starboard engine
were going down
the chopper clips the tree boughs and bounces
hiroko and broken tusk are hurled around the cockpit like rag dolls
the glass cracks with the impact
leaves twigs and branches rush past as the heli jet breaks through the canopy of foliage
the heli jet ploughs into the swamp floor with a sickening crunch spraying mud all around
the canopy implodes
a hail of glass shards rip through the cockpit spraying across hiroko and cutting her skin
the chopper comes to rest in the swamp
the squawking of the local wildlife o
gradually dies down
hiroko moves her head and groans
theres a nasty gash across her forehead
she turns to broken tusk
the door frame on his side is buckled and twisted
part of the metal has sheared off its sharp end impaling him through the shoulder
the predator coughs luminous green blood
weve gotta get you out of here
the sun begins to rise as hiroko exits the heli jet and goes around to the other side
she manages to get the mangled door open
broken tusks wound looks even worse up close
this is gonna hurt some
hiroko gets her arm under broken tusks shoulder
the predator braces himself and starts to move
the agony is excruciating his mandibles open and he lets out a leonine roar
hiroko helps him out of the seat
the predator gets unsteadily to his feet
what happens next is totally unexpected
broken tusks throat bursts fountaining green blood
shocked hiroko gets out of the path of the predators tumbling mass
she looks up
the alien stowaway on the roof of the chopper retracts its sledgehammer tongue its head following her movements
the predators smart weapon has dropped to the floor and is laying blade down in the mire
hiroko scoops up activating it and scrambling away
she gets to her feet and holds the humming disc before her
the alien climbs warily down from the heli jet and the two opponents face each other like sumo wrestlers
hiroko assumes a defensive stance holding the disc ready to strike
the alien hisses its tail stinger coming around
it leaps for her and battle is joined
the alien lashes out but hiroko counters by swinging the weapon time and time again
with each thrust surgically thin wounds open up on the biomechanoids body
one of the aliens attacks sends her reeling to the floor its stinger arching towards her
she parries slicing the tail in half and struggling to her feet
the alien strikes again
