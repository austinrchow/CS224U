written by lawrence d
cohen stephen king from an absolutely glistening white an image which first appears to be a brilliantly shining glass globe and then gradually becomes more of a piece of solid
matter less of a mystery
filling the frame like a picture postcard
modest old fashioned spotless a vision of small town normalcy and virtue
this is the home of margaret white and her daughter carrie
it seems to have been scrubbed from roof to porch it is white
even the lawn seems to have been washed and bleached
we hear a womans voice margaret o
carrie the voice is distant but insistent
it is heard in perspective through the following prologue which initially involves an all american sunbathing beauty of eighteen getting the tan of her life with only a skimpy white
bikini running interference between her skin and the sun
the camera slowly pans over the expanse of her body luxuriant taking it in inch for inch as she dreamily rubs in suntan lotion and licks her lips
the music is coming from a transistor radio by her side shes on a beach blanket in the horan back yard
as she senses someone standing over her someone staring at her body through the half grown hedge which separates the horan back yard from the white house next door
what are those
a terribly appealing little girl a child of indeterminable age
pink cheeks a halo of blonde white hair which will darken in time
what sets her apart from other children however are a pair of bright button brown eyes and its these eyes that we notice as she peers at stella through the
gee you gave me a fright
turning down the radio how long have you been there
not smiling pointing with her finger what are those
stella looks where carrie is pointing the top of her bikini has slipped just barely revealing her breasts white against the golden tan
stella adjusts her suit not out of any particular modesty of her own but as a reflex at being stared at so strangely
those are my breasts honey
a beat then solemnly i wish i had some
course youll have to wait a couple of years but a fact no i wont
why sure you will
emphatic no i wont
glancing behind her momma says no
momma says good girls dont
at something of a loss well im a good girl
and besides doesnt your mother have breasts
glances anxiously at the mention of her mother at the white house next door
she swallows her words so that all stella and we hear is dirtypillows
momma calls them dirtypillows
says shes got them cuz she was bad when she made me
but she senses that carrie is both perfectly serious and quite worried and she too glances warily over at the white house just beyond the half grown hedge
she kneels next to carrie and tries to laugh it off
now honey thats just silly
listen you must be real hot in that long dress
what do you say we go inside and get us some lemonade would you like that
clearly torn tempted but in the clutch of some weird terror as if she expected the earth to open and swallow her up
she shakes her head
offering her hand itll be our secret
carrie now really scared shakes her head and disappears farther into the hedge
sure you can
i make it nice and sweet and and just at that moment a figure appears in the second story window in the white house
although stella and we really cant distinctly see through the suns glare its unmistakably margaret white
the moment this big woman sees her daughter with stella she lets out a bloodcurdling scream both frozen by this terrible sound as she sucks in her breath quivering with
fright looking as if she might faints
she looks quickly to stella then back at the white house then back to stella
for the merest flash she seems to smile or is she about to cry
and then shes gone running around the hedge and then up the porch stairs and into the white house as fast her legs can carry her
stands there riveted
not knowing whats happened what to do
its utterly silent for a moment
and then an incredible cacophony of strange sounds starts coming from the white house an unearthly babble as margaret white screams rants and screeches as carrie sobs that shes sorry
that she forgot
horan in an old housedress with the hem falling down in the back rushes out to answer to her daughters call
what in the name of god
whats the matter
frantic i dont know
carrie was just talking to me and mrs
white started screaming and
the sun glistening brilliantly on it as in the opening shot
again it should appear like a huge glass globe over which we counterpoint one mother daughter dialogue with the less distinct babble of another margaret v
i told you to stay away from there i told you
im sorry momma
to stay away from that girl that whore
which continues over their eyes riveted on the house trying squinting to see through the suns terrible glare
dont you yell at her like that
that poor sweet child
mother weve got to do something
call the police
mother call the police
not about to interfere hopeless the child
at this point the hysteric babble reaches its crescendo we should be able to pick out phrases in this cacophony as margaret rants at carrie to go into her closet
and pray for forgiveness as carries frightened little voice proclaims that she forgot that shes sorry
and then suddenly the screaming stops and its quiet dead quiet
as it becomes more distinct visible
theres a low whistling sound and then what appears to be a stone the size of a small pebble lands on the roof
another slightly larger one appears a second or two later
and then another and another and
squinting blinking at the pebbles which are coming down like marbles
as its pelted with what are now even larger stones whistling screaming in the air like miniature bombs
stones from a perfectly blue summer day
stones ranging in size from marbles to handballs
one of them hits a downspout knocking it onto the lawn
crashing cracking sounds as these pieces of granite tear into the stucco roofing leaving holes
the effect is that of a drum being bombarded
frozen to the spot mrs
horan with her hands over her ears her screams blending with the sound of larger and larger stones as they pelt the house and we hear margaret throughout screaming stop
stella is clutching mrs
horan like a child terrified by the freakiest of summer storms a healthy young woman as her figure in the bikini testifies but a child nonetheless this nightmarish moment
as still larger stones hail from the sky
and then just as suddenly and inexplicably as they started they stop
horan with her hands still over her ears her daughter standing next to her transfixed on the lawn
once again its quiet
as one final stone this one the size of a mere pebble falls from the roof and plops onto the lawn
the image grows lighter and lighter
all the color seems to bleach out turning the screen once again into an incredible silently blazing white
now some years later and no longer glistening so whitely or mysteriously
we see the front of the house as the door flies open
carrie now sixteen or seventeen appears in the doorway carrying school books
as she comes out on the porch the screen door bangs behind her
she is wearing a shapeless drab dress much too long not so much out of style as utterly without style
what remains in this adolescent girl that links her with the pretty child we glimpsed in the prologue are those remarkable eyes
as she comes down the porch stairs we hear carrie
carrie stops turns to reply into the house
you come straight home from school
a moment of hesitation on carries part a very slight hint of rebellion but sweetly i always do momma
then she turns walks to the street gathering pace quickening
as carrie walks down the path from the porch and turns at the sidewalk in the course of which she passes by where the horans used to live
only the horans no longer live here
no one does
its a vacant lot with a for sale sign out front with overgrown weeds
from the looks of them the house vanished a long time ago
carrie is walking to school the sun shining brightly above her
the farther she gets from her house the livelier she seems
we sense that underneath this drab dress is a girl pushing out an altogether different creature than her appearance would suggest
and to help persuade us about this possibility there is music
about five bobby bikes on the other side of one of the streets keeping pace with carrie on a twenty inch schwinn with training wheels
hey fart face
hey old praying carrie
praying carrie praying carrie praying carrie
carrie favors him with a sweet tolerant smile and goes on toward the high school in the background bobby frustrated stops astride is bike and screams after her
bobbys face or as he is known in school the beak
he is pathetically thin myopic weak chinned beak nosed almost a caricature of an adolescent reject
over his face we hear what are you going to leave for us you people in your big cars spewing pollution into the air
we pan the faces of adolescents listening with various degrees of attention indifference or reluctance to you people with heavy feet trampling down the wilderness
you people who peer into the back seats of our cars hours after you come out of the back doors of your motels
soon all we will have is each other and that could be enough
or as he is known to his pupils big belly fromm at his desk in front of the class reading from an assignment paper
if you will let us have room enough and air enough and peace enough to love each other as you never could he sets down the paper and looks at
we will see among others carrie
we also see tommy ross a mid seventies version of the boy next door
good looking clean cut intelligent athletic
he is nodding his head slowly affecting a kind of puzzlement
i must say i must confess this poem displays an extraordinary talent
the knife a talent extraordinary for you tommy ross
all eyes are on tommy who doesnt seem very abashed
in fact he turns clasps his hands over his head to the delight of his classmates
but you dont get the feeling he is a goof off he is a kid aware of his own popularity and comfortable with it
tommy this is slightly different from running for a touchdown
the usual hesitation
then carries hand shoots up
he appears surprised to see carrie ordinarily shy volunteering
her volunteering has surprised her as well
but shes stuck with it
the eyes of the class are on her
and she has to say something
so she does
he leaves his desk moving into the class area seeming to pounce on carrie
bee t ti ful
oh beautiful for spacious skies for amber waves of grain
is that the beautiful you mean
the class is snickering
carrie throws a despairing glance toward tommy
tommy looks at her and away embarrassed
carrie looks down at her desk almost burying herself
that isnt exactly a criticism miss white
looking around anyone else
no one else well at least weve finally gotten carrie white to say something
tommy looks toward carrie with something suggesting compassion
then he looks toward fromm and he is muttering something
or to be specific muttering you suck
you said something
moment popular grin i said
but everyone in the class knows
two teams of girls among them norma watson helen shyres cora and rhonda wilson sisters although not identical twins chris hargensen and sue snell
supervising the game is miss collins wearing a warm up suit and holding a whistle awaiting the next point
among the girls is carrie anxiously watching for the ball to come her way
it has apparently been a close game the competition building steadily
when the shot begins miss collins has just blown her whistle to announce okay now
this is game point
this is the final point of the game and rhonda wilson is serving she is on the opposite team as carrie
giving the score twenty twenty
the ball is successfully served and remains in play for some time as the girls skillfully volley it back and forth over the net
and then just when the tension is its greatest the ball comes over the net toward carrie
its evident that the outcome of the game depends upon her success
the little boy who decided to put his finger in the dyke had it easier
the other girls are ad lib shouting cautions and admonitions to carrie
carrie almost trembles with tension about to bat the ball over the net afraid to hit it
carrie whacks the ball
she shacks it hard
and on a line straight into the net
another chorus of groans with remarks like wouldnt you know
chris storms back toward carrie
low harsh you eat shit
miss collins blows her whistle
steam partially obscures the girls as they whoop and holler and cavort under individual showers
they banter little barbed pleasantries bits of sexual information family plaints talk of college all of which we hear from separate stalls
one by one the showers are turned off the girls stepping out removing pastel bathing caps toweling spraying deodorant bras hooked underpants stepped into
steam hangs in the air
so do words running into one another tumbling drifting
tommy says he hated it on me
my sisters husband picks his nose
so does your sister
too cheap to spend a penny
well go after school
im going with billy well meet you
we pick up miss collins as she steps among the girls spies carrie still standing under the shower
she claps her hands together once smartly
what are you waiting for carrie
as carrie looks at her bell in five minutes
as collins departs and the other girls start to move toward their lockers carrie is left alone in her shower stall
she is soaping herself
in a virtual reverie she begins at her shoulders moving her hands over her breasts in small regular virtually erotic circles
her hand goes out of frame below her stomach
slowly it emerges back into frame full of blood
and just as she and we see this so do the girls
carrie stares at her dumbly
the other girls are quick to take up the chant
chris leads them
one voice chimes in plug it up
others take up this new chant
for a while like counterpoint he chants overlap then the new chant emerges solely plug it up
plug it up
plug it up
plug it up
dime sized drops are striking the tile floor at carries feet
for gods sakes carrie you got your period
as carrie turns toward her clean yourself up
carrie seems bewildered
furiously youre bleeding
you dumb pudding youre bleeding
carrie looks down and wails the sound is very loud
a tampon strikes carries chest plops to her feet
carrie just stares at it
she thinks theyre for lipstick
behind her another girl pretends to throw up
shrieks of laughter
another tampon strikes carrie
the girls are bombarding her with tampons and sanitary napkins some from purses some from the broken dispenser on the wall
as they bombard carrie plug it up plug it up plug it up plug it up
we isolate sue snell at the moment she joins in the chant and watch her beginning to be caught up in what can only be described as a fury
carrie howls and begins to back away howling louder and louder
the door is flung open by collins
what is this
and she takes it in
she jerks the whistle to her mouth blows and blows
the sound is louder than a shriek which it resembles or a howl which it doesnt
and there is sudden silence
to girls get out
the girls retreat sue last
it must be her first
as the girls slip out collins turns to carrie who has backed up and is whimpering
collins slaps her face not too hard at first then with a flash of anger
take care of yourself
one blind searching hand comes up clutches collins white shorts leaving a bloody handprint
she hurls carrie part way across the room toward the broken sanitary napkin dispenser
get over there
and take one
i dont know
never mind the coin slot
grabbing her do it
i dont know how
theres a bright flash as a light bulb poips fizzling out
collins is surprised
and she looks at carrie
her anger seems to seep away
her voice softens
carrie dont you know
shakes her head realizing and wondering you dont
reaches for carrie ill show you
henry morton the principal a decent but somewhat plodding man in his mid forties is tapping out his pipe as he talks to collins
isnt she a bit old for her
well he cant quite say it
her first period
morty until a half hour ago i dont think she knew there was such a thing
he hesitates a moment noticing carries bloody handprint on collins gym shorts
its hard to believe in this day and age a girl in high school wouldnt know
well knowing that mother of hers
cutting her off miss collins if youd been with us longer youd understand we cannot interfere with peoples beliefs
as for the girls carries always been their scapegoat
youll have to do something
but i understood how those girls felt
the whole thing just made me want to take the girl and shake her
its just her period for gods sake
cutting in uncomfortable well send her home
to intercom miss finch send in cassie wright
its carrie white
fiddling with paper clips on his desk oh
the door is opened
carrie stands in the doorway
come in cassie
collins starts to correct him but close the door
up miss finch bring in a dismissal slip
to carrie i think you might take the rest of the day and go home and uh well
take care of yourself cassie
hardly a murmur carrie
were all sorry about this incident
miss finch elderly spinsterish goggles in with the yellow dismissal slip brings it to morton who initials it
to finch as she goes thank you
to carrie would you like to go to the infirmary
carrie is shaking her head
lie down for a while
i think carrie can go home
would you like a ride
again carrie is shaking her head
we could call you a cab
im sure she can walk home
and carrie youre excused from gym for a week
take study hall instead
morton picks up the dismissal slip hands it to carrie
we are sorry about this cassie
sudden fury thats not my name
two things happen simultaneously morton recoils slightly and the ashtray quakes a little and then tumbles from the desk
then carrie goes out
morton comes around the desk stoops to pick up the ashtray stares at it curiously for a moment then looks at collins
slowly that reminds me
a light blew out while i was trying to calm her down
ill send a janitor to fix it
okay thats reality
he puts the ashtray back on the desk decisively dismissing any peculiar thought he may have had
pull back quickly to show red circles of a traffic light
carrie is standing at an intersection waiting for the light to change
cars are flashing by they seem to leave blurs of light
the girls throwing tampons and sanitary napkins
carrie hatred showing
suddenly their motions are arrested
their images polarize the girls disappear except for chris
her image remains
concentrating her hatred it begins to shatter
and then explodes
turns green she walks across the street
a quiet residential street in a lower middle class neighborhood
carrie is walking down the street slowly
there comes bobby erbeter again on his bike paralleling carrie as before hey fart face
hey old praying carrie
she keeps on walking ignoring him
keeping pace with carrie shouting across the street
fart face fart face fart face
turning toward him her face contorted with rage
the bike wobbles on its training wheels
and the bike topples over on top of bobby who screams close now featuring her eyes most prominently
her face is uncertain confused
what just happened
she thought thats right thought something and it happened
and we hear another scream more of an angry shriek and then the strange sight and sound of as the stones pelt the white bungalow years ago
the stones pelting the roof
she is staring across the street at screaming with anger more than anything else as he disentangles himself
he stands up looks toward carrie across the street shakes his little fist
defiantly fart face
the boys defiant chant can be heard as carrie blinks wondering
then she opens her eyes wider
she looks at the boy
she frowns for a moment
the light bulb exploding
the ashtray falling
we hear fart face fart face fart face
a faint smile partly of wonder partly of a strange kind of joy
out of a margarine commercial a packaged nice lady neat trim a good mother good wife
she is preparing dinner in her line of sight a television game show glitters
eleanor frowns momentarily leaves the kitchen
through the middleclass rather tasteful home to the front door
eleanor opens the door
standing in the doorway
she is a large lady dressed in black carrying a worn black leather sack which we will discover is bulging with religious tracts
margaret white is not a welcome visitor but eleanor snell is a polite lady
how have you been mrs
and the doctor
and your daughter
finally eleanor feels constrained to open the door wider put a smile on her face and wont you come in mrs
she steps inside and eleanor closes the door behind her saying i think carrie is in some of sues classes
perhaps some time carrie might visit
im here on the lords work
yes of course
margaret is fishing tracts out of her bag
these will interest the doctor and you
eleanor looks at the tracts with pretended interest im sure they will
and your daughter
a smile well i dont think sue would be cutting in children are godless these days mrs
margarets voice is almost toneless now and throughout
my sue is a good girl
these are godless times
ill drink to that
humor and she regrets it immediately
continuing quietly well all read
the telephone rings
retreating please sit down
margaret doesnt sit and eleanor flees into the kitchen
as eleanor reaches the phone
betty can i call you back
margaret white is here
let me get rid of her and ill call you back
she hangs up opens a drawer takes out some hidden household money a couple of bills and drags herself back into the living room
margaret is still where we left her
wed like to contribute ten
a look at margaret twenty dollars
ill give you a receipt
eleanor shifts from foot to foot while margaret writes out the receipt gives it to her
thank you mrs
ill pray you find jesus before its too late
what can one say
eleanor stands there completely exasperated but retaining her politeness like a steel middle class glove
she accompanies margaret to the door and the latter leaves
eleanor is about to close the door stops seeing sue is coming toward the door
she passes margaret with a quick inaudible greeting and hurries to the front door where her mother is waiting
thats carrie whites mother
as eleanor nods and closes the door
apprehensively what did she want
indicating tracts she gave us these conspiratorial sigh and i gave her a donation
sues face betrays relief but eleanor notices nothing
brightly well how was school today
hold on sue staring at the tracts on the table or perhaps out the window as margaret leaves
a long beat then who is sitting in an old boston rocker by the window in her room which overlooks the street
she is wearing just a slip or perhaps an old terrycloth robe her plain dress and school books on the narrow bed
she is leafing through a teenage magazine on the order of seventeen absorbed in the mundane fantasies of models in their pantyhose and underwear long gowns and mystery men
an escape of sorts
and we reveal carries bedroom in the low attic of the white house tiny plain severe
its decorated with just the fewest embellishments i
high school pennant that margaret would allow in exchange for her own prices a crucifix above carries bed a small bureau with an equally small mirror a bible and plastic
glow in the dark madonna and child and various religious prints and plaster quotations on the wall
caught up in the magazine in the most normal of female fantasies courtesy of the slick madison avenue mind
and then with that extra sense of perception apparatus that fears its about to be caught doing something it shouldnt carrie glances out the window and down to see as
this formidable vision of black strides down the walk
another woman like this would be coming home from a funeral margaret actually seems to like black
her heart pounding as we glimpse that look of terror we witnessed earlier a scared little girl now encased in the body of an adolescent
as she hears margaret close the front door and call out her name as she hangs up her coat carrie hastily stashes the magazine under the mattress
then she begins to dress as we hear the sounds of margaret in the kitchen starting her daily afternoon ritual of making tea
and then the telephone rings only to stop as margaret picks up the receiver
its just as carrie dreaded its the school and she stands by the door trying desperately to overhear margarets muffled voice
and then margaret hangs up and in a deadly tone of voice not yelling but enunciation with a terrible clarity she calls up the stairs i know youre listening
and defeated carrie braces herself and goes down the as she hurries down toward her mother and into where margaret is standing by the stove her back to her in
the teakettle is just beginning to boil over the gas burner and in this altogether strange little kitchen a veritable arsenal of lace tatted religious art margaret is a rock
carrie sits down at the kitchen table bursting with shame and the need to talk
yet she recognizes her mothers wall of silence knowing she wont speak until shes ready
theyve been through this dance a thousand times
finally carrie breaks
who was it that called
no response what did they say
point one and some grim satisfaction
yet she doesnt respond immediately
then she turns from the stove
softly youre a woman now
oh momma why didnt you tell me something
i was so scared
margaret walks over to the table and sits next to carrie
she puts on rimless glasses then opens the bible and starts to read with one of those strange kathryn kuhlman looks on her face and god made eve from the
rib of adam
and eve was weak and loosed the raven on the world and the raven was called sin she pushes the bible at carrie her finger on the place
and the raven was called sin
why didnt you tell me
oh momma overriding and the raven was called sin
and the first sin was intercourse
i was so scared
and the other girls they made fun of me and threw things and margarets hand flashes out backhanding carrie into the wall
its a wallop of a slap the sting of it bringing tears to her eyes
momma please listen
it wasnt my fault
another backhanded blow knocks carrie to the floor
and eve was weak and
say it woman
momma please help me
and eve was weak and loosed the raven on the world
they threw things
overriding and the raven was called sin
and the first sin was intercourse
momma please listen
and the lord visited eve with a curse and the curse was the curse of blood
the teakettle starts to whistle
you should have told me
margaret clutches carries wrist in a vise
heavenward o lord help this sinning woman see the sin of her days and ways
show her that if she had remained sinless no
the curse of blood would never have come on her
she may have been tempted by the antichrist
she may have committed the sin of lustful thoughts
the teakettle is whistling louder a high pitched scream
dont you lie to me carietta dont you know by now i can see inside you
i can see your sin just as surely as god can
momma let me go
margaret flings open the door of the kitchen closet
we will pray
we will pray woman we will pray to jesus for our woman weak wicked sinning souls
she switches on the light and there is jesus on the wall rictus crown of thorns bathed in an ominous blue light
a vision of a wrathful god
throughout the following carrie struggles desperately but shes no match for her mother
and the lord visited eve with a curse and the curse was the curse of blood
and there was a second curse and this was the curse of childbearing and eve brought forth cain in sweat and blood
she propels carrie into the closet slams the door behind her
margarets voice continues overlapping onto very much the little girl now as she sinks to the floor of the closet crying disheveled beaten
the closet is just what every child ever dreaded about the night
looking down at carrie
she looks away and inwards
with her we see falling on the shower floor
surrounding carrie jeering her bombarding her
impassive impersonal unconcerned or so it seems
in the forefront of the pack
as the girls would see her cowering the bloody napkins pelting her
the blood seems to be streaming down his face it moves
tears are streaming down her face
she whispers please
moving in slowly on tommy ross ford which is parked in the shadows on the hill something of a ridge which overlooks the town and is dedicated to eros by
high school students and occasional graduates
the music swells as we move in
and finally we peer into the car where we see sue and tommy have finished making love in the back seat
they are both putting their clothes in order silently slowly
then they climb into the front seat
sue takes out a cigarette
tommy lights it with the dashboard lighter
they say nothing as sue smokes for a few moments
then tommy looks at her closely
she turns away
hey whats the matter
he puts his arm around her clumsily
what did i do
its not you
hey everythings all right
i love you honey
silence did i
blurting its carrie
sharply dont call her that
imitating carrie its
laughing thats what she said when i read that poem you wrote for me

sue has turned away from him
hey honey it was a beautiful poem

what the hells the matter with you
she is crying thats what
hey are you crying

he tries to turn her toward him
manfully he forces her around

shes silent hey it was a joke wasnt it

and the way she dresses
hey sue shes asking for it
vehemently how would you like to be carrie white

what the hell do you want me to do
i want you to help me
or are you just interested in fucking me
angrily dont say that

tommy moves back from sue
he is looking at her trying to figure her out
he wants to do something he doesnt want an argument but
okay what can i do
i want you to think about carrie white
incredulously you want me to sit here and think about
moment are you serious
moment youre serious
moment whats there to think about
think about it
he stares off through the windshield
he is really puzzled
he steals a look at sue
he starts to put his arm around her she moves a little subtly but clearly
tommy stares off into space again
i never thought about her
i mean she wasnt someone you had to think about
beat she was always there keeping to herself in that stupid dress that weird mother
beat you know what i mean
sue glances toward him
of course she knows
and he is beginning to understand
tommy looks straight ahead again
he is starting to think
its not all that easy
almost under his breath carrie white
it does come out as a question
margaret is at the sewing machine
she is either listening to a reasonable facsimile of kathryn kuhlman preaching on the radio or instead to an old victrola which plays tennessee ernie fords let the lower lights
a black forest cuckoo clock providing a sense of lapsed time
suddenly the treadle on the sewing machine depresses itself
the needle begins to dip up and down the bobbin whirs and jerks
margaret turns around to see she is standing in the entrance of the living room
her demeanor seems more peaceful calm almost too calm
a touch of fear in her eyes
but go to bed
she crosses over to her mother kisses her lightly on the unmoving head
good night momma
carrie goes to the stairs
carrie goes into her room
carrie turns on a light
she undresses slowly wearily
and then she stops and looks at herself in the mirror
a close tired inspection
her eyes seem hollow haunted
carrie doesnt like what she sees she doesnt like herself
slowly cracks appear in the mirror spiderwebs
the mirror cracks wider
and flex the mirror shatters crashes to the dresser in pieces loudly some of the pieces fall on the floor
a moment of utter panic now what
as margaret strides up them past the landing and tries the knob on carries door
she rattles the knob
but to no avail
carrie open this door
a beat nothing carrie
another beat then sweetly its open momma
margaret tries the knob again and it is indeed open
where carrie is kneeling by her bed now in her flannel nightgown praying
what was that noise
margaret peers around the room she did hear a mirror break no mistake about it
but there it is whole again as her reflection in it testifies
margaret walks over to it rearranges the plastic glow in the dark madonna and child on the dresser
go to bed
she leaves the doorway and we return to carrie who smiles sweetly
and then flex
the door slams closed
down the class of twenty five or so girls still in their street clothes lined up against the gym wall under their class numbers as walks in front of them
with a clipboard taking roll
still tracking featuring sue here
the camera comes to an empty space without being told we can tell its carries
hesitates then moves right along
and the wilsons
whore identical twins
small smile then closing her book okay
all the girls except chris obey
you too chris
and spit out that gum
overly sweet wherell i put it miss collins
you can choke on it for all i care
now sit down
pausing for a second then deciding its better to go along without talking back
she sits down
shifting nervously unused to collins absolute no nonsense tone
taking a deep breath
i just want you all to know that you did a shitty thing yesterday
a really shitty thing
the freckled slightly pudgy girl sitting next to sue giggles nervously
but no one joins her and she clasps her hand over her mouth trying to stifle it
glaring at helen silencing her
did any of you stop to think that carrie white has feelings
do any of you ever stop to think
no i guess youve got your minds on your dates and the prom
chris i imagine you can take your pick whos the lucky guy
mumbling billy nolan
i cant hear you
chris tries to control her anger is barely able to
billy nolan collins eye to eye with chris now smiles
well isnt he the lucky one
she walks down the line stopping in front of sue
and what about you sue
whos taking you
right beat then okay
now my idea for this little trick you pulled was three days suspension and refusal of your prom tickets
as collins words sink in groans of disappointment
almost seeming o single sue out as she continues at least thats the way it seems to sue
that would hit you where you live now wouldnt it
and youd deserve it i dont think any of you have any idea of just how nasty what you did was
the office has decided that youre to have one weeks detention
the girls sigh with relief
chris has a particularly smug look
collins takes in their reactions then she reels in the line but
theres one little catch
its to be my detention
right here in the gym
fifty minutes every day
get the picture
as they realize just how theyve been had indeed getting the picture
i wont come
no less determined but cool
thats up to you chris
thats up to all of you
punishment for skipping detention is three days suspension and the loss of your prom tickets
any other thoughts
sober slightly frightened
she is standing in the hall looking into the gym through the small glass window cut in the door
collins has finished with the girls she stands in front of them the victor
now change up
the girls start to turn
carrie quickly pulls away from the door before she can be seen hastens away
collins watches the girls filing into the locker room a small triumphant smile on her face
carrie is now far down the hall a small distant figure
now she goes out of sight around a corner
the hall is empty and still hold then as the girls change silently into their green gym outfits quiet subdued most of them resigned to their punishment
chris however is about to blow up she tosses her skirt into her locker and slams the door shut
and then another and another and yet another flipping by us one title following another as carrie looms over the card catalog searching
the title cards include poison politics and poltergeists on this latter card it reads a ghost supposed to be responsible for table rappings and other mysterious noisy disturbances
it also contains a cross reference see tele and the rest of the word is blurred
her face curious deciding to follow it up
as carrie flips through the t card catalog passing everything from talmud to tarantula until she gets to on the word and below it thought to be the ability to
move or to cause changes in objects by force of the mind perhaps a genetic recessive in origin
her mind struggling with the words on the card pondering thoughtful
her heart starts to beat
on the girls all of them in the green gym suits being run ragged just as collins promised
shes pushing them extremely hard barking orders at them using her whistle like a drill instructor
as she runs to position herself next to sue
she cant get away with this
im going to get her
that goddamn snerd let it go chris
and sue runs on leaving chris red in the face breathless furious behind
chris deliberately slows down and then just halts
the periods not up hargensen
it is for me
there are ten minutes left
stick them up your ass
chris starts to stalk past collins who reaches out and firmly pushes her back
chris becomes immediately hysterical
you cant hit us
youll get canned for this you bitch
my father one more word from you and ill throw you across the room
want to see if im telling the truth
appealing to the others now flailing out of control
she cant get away with this
if we all stick together we can as chris looks to them for support none of them quite knowing what to do
featuring chris and sue lifeless shut up chris
just shut up
a mutineer without a single ally now
she realizes it and heads for the door leading to the locker room and this time collins doesnt even try to stop her
at the door this isnt over
this isnt over by a long shot
the door slams shut leaving the girls and collins frozen by chriss outburst
the bell gives a shrill ring and we the local after school hangout
clusters of students milling in and around booths
pinball machines a jukebox thumping no where to run by martha reeves and the vandellas
sue is sitting reading alone in one of the booths as chris enters says hello to some of her clique and spots her
just who ive been looking for
sue looks up and tries to force her face into a smile
chris slides into the booth across from her and thrusts her john f
kennedy school yearbook across the table an action which sue involuntarily jerks away from out of nervousness
continuing i wanted you to sign my yearbook
hey wheres you old man did he stand you up
busying herself with the yearbook still at practice well i guess youve heard im out of the prom
i bet that cocksucker morton loses his job though
daddys suing them
come over and say hi to sue
sue slides the yearbook back across the table to chris who examines it continuing hey is that it
just sue snell
billy goons into frame next to chris glomming his arm around her neck
i think were going anyway right billee
sure thing charlie
chris playfully jabs him in the ribs
you mean crash
sure why not
hey listen ive got a good one
roses are red violets are blue sugar is sweet but carrie white eats shit
billy goon that he is cracks up
sue finds it not at all funny but doesnt know exactly what to do about what shes feeling
chris ive got to go
a new tune comes on the juke shirley and company whooping it up on shame shame oblivious her laughter turning to fury that goddamn carrie
if only the rest of you had walked out with me
jesus sue why didnt you
i took the detention because i thought we i earned it
it was a shitty thing to have done
end of statement
that goddamn snerd and her batshit mother saying were all going to hell
rising whatd she ever do to you chris
or to any of us
why do you hate her so much
tell me if im wrong but who was that n there pitching with the rest of us
it comes out a pinched nerve me
but i stopped
dawning on her getting it finally oh
oh arent you just it
oh my yes
imitating prissy you stopped
hey billee she stopped
sue is scared now she hears it coming
theres no question about it though the rumbles have already begun and theres no stopping whats coming
continuing god im dumb sometimes
billee hey billee do you want to know why suze here didnt walk out
billys over by the pinball machines with some of his goon squad
he boastfully struts around much to their obvious delight making the sound of a chicken in reply
seeing this feeling it all about to lurch out of control and turn against her
the bottoms falling out
ill see you around chris
featuring chris prominently a bloodhound now sure of the scent
you stopped remember
so just stop again
uglier why didnt you walk out
why didnt you walk out sue
you didnt walk out sue
little suzy creamcheese
because you didnt want to miss a moment of your precious prom
sue fights back the tears and fury trembling now
but she tries to muster up some dignity
and you dont
not about to be put off youre goddamn right i dont
but were on your case now
beat ill bet youve got your dress all picked out too
what color is it
shes about to break holding it in as best she can
chris just as quickly as she spots the weakness shuts it off bottling up all the rage into he cruelest stainless steel smile she can muster
dismissively see you around sue
and thats it shut up shut down shut out
sue turns and starts to walk out of the cavalier
in the background behind her its all out of focus an incoherent babble of snickering and clucking laughter
shes crossed the line
sue sits in the bleachers overlooking the field
she is preoccupied still shaken by the afternoons confrontation with chris
the track team is moving past the bleachers a coach in the field clocking them and shouting orders
tommy in his track uniform peels away from the group and comes running up to sue
i want to talk to you
sure whats up
to avoid the noise of the cheerleaders practicing down in front of them and the other girls sitting in the bleachers half watching their boyfriends and half eyeing tommy and
sue sue beckons tommy to follow her away from the group behind the bleachers and as they walk off together we hear the following if i asked you to do something for me something special would you
nodding uh huh
no matter how crazy it sounded
the sound is muffled and we dont hear what she says
but we do hear continuing exploding are you out of your mind
a big hangout cruising night on the boulevard
neon convertibles rebel without a cause meets american graffiti seventies style
in other words the works with music
as a chevy leaves a sizeable patch of rubber on the street as it grinds to a hard stop just barely halting before it almost went through a red light
and collided with the traffic already in the intersection
which belongs to the aforementioned billy nolan a character whose life and brains stopped around the time he saw rebel on television
hes chriss boyfriend and a huge cross swings around his neck
right now hes utterly amused by his harrowing driving and turns to chris who ignores him still brooding over her afternoon losses
billy takes a huge toke from a joint and hands it to her she ignores that too and proceeds to busy herself applying makeup in the visor window
so billy looks out his window and strikes up some banter with a fellow cruiser idling beside them at the light
the light changes and billy peels out an action with throws chris backwards onto the seat
he just laughs as he weaves through traffic
continuing slow down
as he pays no heed slow down you stupid shit
youll kill us you stupid shit
billy lazily slaps her speeds up
dont call me that
he slaps her again
continuing under her breath stupid shit
disgustedly oh wow
he slams on the brakes and pulls into looking down on a parking lot where cars are parked a huge pullmans car which has been converted into a restaurant
this after school hangout is called the cavalier
as billy reaches over very confidently to draw chris to him
she lets herself be kissed then pulls away abruptly
he grabs at her and she pulls away
cant you wait a minute
youre so ignorant
thats what you like
ill show you what you like chuckie
she pushes him away
he grabs her
she pushes he grabs
grabs at her tit
there goes the blouse the buttons are ripped off
he slaps her
whatd i tell you
then after some time he leans over and kisses her
she lets him
he kisses her again and she responds
he goes at it
and she squirms away
continuing hell is this
i want you to do something
eagerly yeah what
i want you to do something for me
warily something important
it will be very important to me
it will make me feel very good if you do it
she moves closer to him
her hand dips down out of frame
she blows in his ear
billy is beginning to writhe he moves in on her but she holds him off playing him like a puppet
continuing billy i hate carrie white
on which we see the opening helicopter credit sequence from duel at diablo
the television is in where the movies sound continues uninterrupted for a bit over an incredible silence between tommy and sue
they are sitting on a couch
the silence is finally broken by a reluctant okay
ill do it
and we margaret slowly opens the door to carries room and enters
light filters in from the street
carrie is lying in bed motionless asleep
margaret crosses the room quietly
she leans over the bed
on the table next to it is the glow in the dark statue not in its usual place on the dresser
carries face in the soft light seems very innocent
low carrie did you pray
margaret bends over carrie
and with surprising tenderness she kisses carries forehead
the she straightens up quickly as though she has violated herself and leaves the room
carrie opens her eyes
she pulls a book out from under the covers then she stares at the madonna child figurine it begins to glow brighter and brighter illuminating the room
its bright enough to read by now and we leave carrie expanding her education and as carrie examines a shelf of books with titles like cosmic consciousness and r
ogilves hidden powers of the mind
she decides on the latter just as a voice startles her carrie
she stares at him and quickly covers the binding of the book with her hand covering the title
he looks as startled as she does
howre you doing
after a beat almost inaudibly okay
its harder than he thought it would be just trying to make small talk is agonizing
but try it he does i thought you had gym this period
all she can do is shake her head
and a young man not easily deterred he tries again
continuing whatre you reading
trying to cover and not very well its about
check and stalemate
which brings him to umm
if you dont have a date for the prom would you want to go with me
without saying a word carrie walks down the aisle of book shelves
he follows her into the main room where students are reading working
continuing its next friday and i know this is later notice but they stop selling tickets soon and the bell rings
i dont like to be tricked
a couple of students stare at tommy talking to carrie as they start leaving the library
but its too late shes gone already out the door
as tommy weaves through the crowd after her
gangly george dawson spots him hey ross
but tommy ignores him in his singular pursuit
a couple of other students watch this is this their tommy ross actually trying to speak with carrie
but hes oblivious of any looks now any snickering all he wants is to catch up with carrie
which he does he manages to touch her arm and its a weird moment this contact
she turns around her head painfully ducked down
continuing hey its no big deal
and she looks up and stares at him with that peculiar intensity that cuts through all the clamor around them
quiet quietly do you people think you can just go on tricking me forever
tommy stands there helpless sensing just how much of a big deal it is
seeing that shes on the verge of tears hes feeling even worse and all he can say is sorry
but its too little and too late
and whats more shes gone swallowed up into the clamor of students rushing to beat the bell
which rings as we as collins tidies up after one of the classes throwing towels into huge cans etc
only to hear a mewing whimpering sound and come upon carrie whos huddled in one of the dark corners of the room crying
its almost as if she created her own closet of space
on no response carrie whats the matter
on still no response was it one of the girls
did one of the girls do something to you
do you want a kleenex
its all right
just tell me theres nothing to be afraid of
when can i come back to gym
not until monday
now what is it
are you going to tell me
come on carrie tell me
i got asked to the prom
tommy ross asked me
tommy ross thats wonderful
i know who he goes around with
theyre trying to trick me again
maybe he really meant it
i mean maybe he really did mean it
maybe you should think about it
it might be really fun
you might have a really good time
it would be a nightmare
you should have a better image of yourself
you just think youre unattractive but look at your hair
its really beautiful
if you just fixed it up a little
here ill show you
where collins and morton are grabbing a quick cup of coffee
carries been asked to the prom
by tommy ross
morton goes into a coughing fit accidentally knocking over his coffee in the process
collins watches slightly amused by his reaction
when he recovers what about his girlfriend
doesnt he date the little snell girl
i think she put him up to it
where collins is grilling a very nervous sue just sue so far
whos brainstorm was this
no response what are you trying to do
youve got it wrong
i hope so
i wouldnt have expected this from you sue
not any of it
what do you want to know
why tommy asked her to the prom
after a beat well
reluctant able to go this far i asked him to
swallowing i asked him to
but in gods name what for
what could you possibly have in mind
whos also in the office for this interrogation ill at ease trying to appear cool
you mean what good would it do
bring her out of
make her a
a part of things
oh come on sue
none of us are that stupid
and neither is carrie
and youre not going to go
youre going to stay home and miss your senior prom
just as this point norma watson a prissy little pleaser with a mouth whose verbal discretion could make the telephone obsolete enters the room with a sheaf of attendance sheets
for the next week
all conversation ceases
continuing yes norma
what is it
just the attendance sheets miss collins
just leave them on the desk
to sue you understand you cant come without a date
sue understands perfectly well but with norma there shes not about to say a word
and collins finally picks up on this continuing is there something else norma
butter could melt no miss collins
and she exits as slowly as she can trying to hear the last possible word
then to tommy which brings us to you
miss collins i have to get to practice
thats too bad
look this is between sue and me
if you dont mind
oh but i do
or would you rather we continue this discussion in mr
bluffed then off handedly like we first saw him in fromms class whats the big deal
because its a very big deal for carrie white
and you know it
anyway shes already said no
you can make her change her mind
dont overrate me
just dont try
its not okay
to collins you cant order anyone not to take someone to the prom
i can make sure you dont hurt carrie
were not trying to hurt her
were trying to help her
continuing tommy when you come to the prom with carrie white dont you think youll look a little ridiculous
we dont care how we look
sue looks over at tommy
continuing do we
tommy says nothing hes caught between a rock and a hard place
as tommys volkswagen parks across the street tommy gets out and approaches the white house
carrie is inside watching him come up the stairs
she remains on the hall side of the screen door
so this is where you live
whatre you doing here
laughs arent you going to ask me in
she shakes her head he laughs again a little nervously
throughout this scene in which he remains on the porch side of the screen door he catches glimpses of the weird house within
continuing why not
what do you want
right to the point huh
okay about the prom
i already told you
a little charm nothing to stop you changing your mind
girls do it all the time
why are you doing this
hey im asking you because i want to
look i dont do anything i dont want to
sure you can
in the background in the kitchen perhaps margaret calls out carries name
carrie glances nervously behind her then back at tommy
you better go
who are you talking to
dont you think you better answer
no one momma
youre going with me
no one will laugh
well see to it
not til you say yes
carrie swipes at her eyes with the back of her hand helpless honest confused
shed really like to go at this point but that extra sense in her is resisting
why is it so important to you
i dont know
maybe its because you liked my poem
and in just these split seconds she decides had he not liked her poem had margaret not called perhaps she could have held back
ill pick you up at eight
then thank you
tommy smiles at her and turning to leave touches her hand against the screen door
a goodbye nothing more
he goes down the walk toward his car
she takes the hand he touched and brushes the hair back from her face
a little beautiful
did you hear me
and as she turns away from the door we why not
why did you do it
god everyones talking
we pull back to see the gym
the entire back wall has been devoted to a giant mural of stars and planets it seems the prom is to have a celestial theme and the gymnasium is in
the process of being hung with a great deal of crepe paper moons etc
i asked tommy to take carrie
i thought i owed her that much
where does that put the rest of us
you have to make up your own mind
and tommy went along with it
pauses i guess the other kids think im stuck up
theyre all talking about it
but most of them still think youre okay
as thick as thieves off in the corner whispering
giggles a small dissenting faction
i guess shes having a field day with this
susie she hates your guts
sue nods she knew it now she hears it
full frontal view of thee bungalow in the frame
the lights are on downstairs theres a slight drizzle and haze
hold then as carrie and margaret finish dinner
silence punctuated only by the slight drizzle outside and occasional flashes of thunder and lightning
then you havent touched your pie carrie
it makes me have pimples momma
your pimples are the lords way of chastising you
momma please see that i have to start to get
to try and get along with people
whatever are you going on about
have you been showering with the other girls again
ive been invited to the prom
a foreign language prom
its next friday and its that teacher the one that called
shell be sorry
momma please see that im not like you
im funny i mean the kids think im funny
i dont want to be
i want to try and be a whole person before its too late to margaret throws her cup of tea in carries face
its cold wet sticky
but carrie holds herself in shes going to be in charge this time
she takes a deep swallow and continues continuing his name is tommy ross and hes a very nice boy
promised to stop in and meet you before and overlapping i said no
have me in by midnight
ive shaking her head now uncontrollable no no no accepted
margarets shaking with fury trembling
carrie wipes the stringy wet hair from her forehead
continuing ive accepted momma
i have accepted
after all youve been taught everyone isnt bad momma everything isnt sinful
go to your closet and pray
ask to be forgiven
youll like this boy he
and margaret at this word shifts gears and winds up in the grip of a weird babble
yes boys come next
after the blood the boys come
like sniffing dogs
momma grinning and slobbering trying to find out where the smell comes from where the smell is
yes in cars
i know where they take you in their cars
ive seen it all right
momma you better stop
youre not going
ive already said i would momma
then say no
or well move
well move from here and youll never see that boy again
a gust of wind causes the window to blow open
margaret gets up and starts toward the window
carrie is silent watching herself being shut out
continuing the rains coming in
momma sit down
im going to close the windows
ill get them
please sit and talk to me
margaret continues toward the kitchen window to close it
carrie knits her brow and flex the window closes
margaret whips around facing carrie
im going momma
and things are going to change around here
the sound of a window shutting in another room
continuing its satans power
first he entered your father carried him off
he ran away momma
everyone knows that
a couple of windows
the devil tempted him
he ran away with a woman momma
all men are the same
that boy hes like all the rest he doesnt flex
the rest of the windows in the house thunder shut
i dont care
he asked me to go
and im going
im going momma
you cant stop me
leading to hentys farm
a slight drizzle or the ground is still wet
a little more than a crescent moon silhouettes a group of five billy and chris in front and billys twitchy zoo a completely wrecked kenny garson a very nervous freddy
de lois and an occasionally giggling goggled henry trennant trailing behind
de lois is swinging a nine pound sledge hammer in the air the other two goons are struggling with an ice chest and steel pails
hentys farmhouse and barn are in the distance
hell of a risk for a joke
trennant giggles inanely
billy stops and glares at de lois
you want out
hastily no uh uh
then its a good joke billy
trennant giggles again
garson is stoned silly zonked deadpan
he greedily sucks the last remnants of a joint into oblivion before our eyes
de lois angrily snatches the roach out of garsons fingers
continuing hey piggie
trennant just giggles inanely
another long beat then continuing you sure old man henty wont be around
i told you
hes at a funeral
trennant explodes into a fit of high pitched laughter
shut up henry
whose funeral did he go to
jesus christ she musta been older than god
trennant lurches into another cackle
and in spite of themselves billy and chris start laughing too
even de lois starts laughing
the group passes a no trespassing sign prompting continuing the bastard is going to shit where he stands when he comes back and gets a look
garson drops one of the pails on the ground
the sound of trennants high pitched giggle
and overlaps into the harmonic chanting of de lois trennant and garson soo ee soo ee pig pig pig
soo ee soo ee pig pig pig
and an old sleeping boar and two sows are gradually revealed
the face of five coming to rest on de lois
doan worry piggies doan worry
im gonna bash your fuckin heads in and you woan have to worry bout the bomb no more
shut up and do it already
i will i will
im not gonna give em time to burp
but its too late
de lois has lost all conviction
he hands the sledge hammer to billy
chris chilled to the bone rubs herself to keep warm
do it billy
billy touches the ball of his thumb to the edge of the sledge hammer
continuing do it quick
and billy smiles
yes he actually smiles
as he raises the sledge hammer we go to the sun is shining perhaps the next day a day later
the house is a picture postcard under it we hear the sweet muffled sound of amazing grace
its just loud enough for us to hear it joyous triumphant
margaret sits beneath the plaster crucifix
the sampler however sits in her lap unfinished unminded
shes virtually catatonic
amazing grace a sweet contemporary rendition is on the webcor
a pleasure after kathryn kuhlman
carrie sits at the sewing machine finishing work on the pattern for her prom dress
she removes the material from the sewing machine which we now see is a lush crushed velvet
i might have known it would be red
the cuckoo clock is ticking ticking
carrie stares at margaret then turns the sewing machine off
she looks back at margaret then turns her attention to the machine her eyes sparkling
courtesy of carrie the treadle on the machine depresses itself
the needle starts to bob up and down up and down up and down
the side wheel spins
and then stops
softly only clearing the thread momma
then rises and goes to start up the stairs to her room
margaret looks after her
abruptly its satan
wearily pitying oh momma
he has given you a power
momma it doesnt have anything to do with satan
if i concentrate hard enough i can make things move
satan is clever
momma there are other people
people with the power
its a part of me
if it were id know it
you poor child
he doesnt let you know hes working through you
momma id know
you are to renounce this power
you must give it up
you must never use it
im going to do my homework momma
another step up the stairs stopping as margaret hurls after her
theres going to be a judgement
theres nothing more to say
carrie walks up to the stairs and we very dark shadowy deserted
the night before the prom
silence then a scraping sound of a being jimmied open
behind the thick glass we see a face just whose isnt clear yet
the slip lock comes free the sill is being pushed up and billys head appears
chris is right behind him
as a flashlight is shined upwards at the criss crossing girders sheathed in crepe paper at banks of lights which will later be used to shine down and highlight two
areas in particular the huge wall mural and the chalked in spot where the king and queen of the prom will be crowned
dollying right behind them as they proceed toward the stage area past the numerous tables set up for the prom goers past the twin bandstands
billy is carrying the ice chest chris the flashlight
as they arrive behind the stage
billy puts the chest down and takes out a pair of playtex rubber gloves snaps them on
then he takes out two small pulleys and a coil of twine
looking somewhat like a bizarre mountaineer climbing a ladder which takes him up to a narrow platform overlooking the stage area
shining the flashlight to guide billy her face flushed with excitement
as he disappears behind a short draw curtain which obscures the girders over the stage
unable to see him suddenly feeling very alone
whats it like up there
no response billee
no answer genuinely scared billy
and just at that moment a piece of crepe paper floats into the frame and lands in chriss hair
she jumps utterly unnerved
she looks up to see billy staring down at her from the platform grinning
you stupid shit
still in good humor nice talk
do you hear me just hurry up
weeze doing the best we can
i want to go home
just keep your tits on and ill let you pull it when the time comes
i plan to
cutting between the final arrangements for the prom itself and carries preparations as the night approaches
the emphasis is on these two paralleling elements although this montage scored throughout with happier and happier music will also feature some of our lesser characters
among other things we will see a the gym as last minute arrangements are made more crepe paper hung party favors put on tables etc
b carrie in a town store as she shops for makeup c norma watson under a hair dryer her mouth going a mile a minute as a manicurist does her
nails and looks utterly exhausted d tommy picking out carries corsage at the florist e carrie at the sewing machine finishing her dress which we still dont see a happy look on her face f the gym as a bank of lights suddenly illuminate the mural on the stage wall g sue having dinner with her parents h the twins in front of their dressing tables both of them putting on enormous fake eyelashes simultaneously i ernest the class president making sure the microphone on the stage works j the band among them the beak setting up k sandra stenchfeld practicing her fabulous twirling baton act l a door which opens to reveal the twins in their high heels both of them several inches taller than their depressed looking dates m george and frieda he in his tuxedo she in her prom dress a flash as freidas parents take a polaroid of this night to remember n the gym with the adult chaperones teachers administrators standing around looking for something to do
it is now the night of the prom just minutes before it officially begins we end this montage and carrie sits in front of that same mirror but this time
theres a different attitude
and a different girl which pleases her
she looks different very different from before
shes dressed in her lush red crushed velvet prom dress but the shot is angled in such a way that we dont see it
in any case it is not prim
she is wearing some makeup
well there has been a transformation
in the background the door is opened by margaret
come in momma
margaret advances into the room
carrie opens a florist box and takes out a lovely corsage of tiny tea roses
do you want to pin it on momma
i can see your dirtypillows
breasts momma breasts
every woman has them
carries voice is calm nothing not even margaret will spoil tonight and ever so slightly this scene and all that follow for a considerable period of time has an edge
of unreality to it
its all been diffused a bit a fairy tale through carries eyes
what would look bad or tacky looks acceptable what looked good before now looks spectacular
take off that dress
well burn it together well pray for forgiveness
the black forest cuckoo clock sings out downstairs
its eight oclock
hes not coming
stop it momma
im nervous enough
margaret reaches up and pinches her cheek hard leaving a red mark
she looks toward carrie
carrie is pinning the tea roses on herself
margaret hooks her right hand into a claw rips at her cheek leaving a thin line of blood
stop hurting yourself momma
thats not going to stop me either
margaret strikes herself in the mouth with her fist
go away momma
you know im right
hell laugh at you
theyll all laugh at you
itll be okay
bur shes rattled and nervously starts moving around a series of objects in the room
cosmetics on the bureau the florist box the glow in the dark statue
but its sheer will at this point
its after eight and theres no sign of tommy
its not too late
you can stay here with me
ill answer the door and say youre sick ill say momma sit on the bed
margaret is pushed back on the bed
horrified she rises again
ill say that you changed your mind ill say flex
margaret is thrust back on the bed
thou shalt not suffer a witch to live
the words stop
but margarets eyes are fixed on carrie as carrie leans toward her
carries voice is soft and compassionate
youll say nothing momma
you are going to have to learn that im not like you not anymore
the buzzer downstairs sounds
carrie goes to her window and sees at the front door the overhead light shining on his hair making it glisten
he looks very handsome
she goes back to the bed and picks up her wrap then to margaret ill be home early momma
the buzzer downstairs sounds again
theres going to be a judgement
momma you will be quiet until im gone
beat then at the door i love you momma
and shes gone down the carrie who opens the door
well we know hes beautiful
and hes looking at carrie
he didnt know he didnt know she could be beautiful
and she is
he reaches out his hand
carrie takes his hand
hand in hand carrie and tommy walk down the path toward his car
they are observed by at the window of carries room
margaret leaves the window as we hear tommys car drive off
she goes out of the room
down the stairs through the dining room into the kitchen
almost the same path that carrie trod but trod so differently
while carries pace had been light nervously expectant margarets is slow and heavy
margaret crosses to one of the drawers
she reaches in and takes out a long carving knife it gleams in the light
the school gymnasium is lit up brightly for the prom cars are pulling in among them tommys ford
as tommy turns off the ignition
carries staring at the other couples getting out of their cars
tommy watches her taking it all in
its like a dream
you can still change your mind you know
she turns to him and realizes hes teasing her
easier said than done
please not yet
beat can we sit here another minute
tommy laughs and nods
a moment of silence
carrie is miserable shes happy to be with tommy shes trying to have a good time but its hard
its like getting up to dance the first time
perhaps it would be better to sit this one out
and then out it comes maybe
maybe this was a mistake
hey it wont be so bad
she tries to smile at him
its not very persuasive
really i mean it
theyre okay youll see
beat shes trying to believe him dont be nervous
a little self mocking id look awfully silly dancing by myself
and thats just enough hes taken her mind off her own fear just enough to make her laugh
where the prom is already under way the band playing an energetic version of harlem nocturne
from carries pov its all magic explosions of pastel color everyone looking like they stepped out of an advertisement for happiness
carrie just stands at the double doors which are the main entrance to the gym taking it all in as tommy hands their tickets to ushers at the door
as carrie stares at the giant mural on the stage wall full of celestial moon stars and rockets a voice bellows out behind her
gawd you look queer
the source of the salutation and tommys best friend
he bounds into frame wearing a t shirt with a painted black tie under his dinner jacket
his girlfriend frieda jason tags behind
when did you come out of the treetops bomba
ross if id known you were going to look this good id have asked you instead of frieda
the two boys immediately go into a mock fight
frieda comes up to carrie
dont let it bother you
if they destroy each other ill dance with you
carrie smiles back at her nervously theres an awkward silence
hey whered you buy your dress
i love it
shyly i made it
unaffected surprise made it
carrie hesitates realizes frieda is quite sincere
frieda laughs so does carrie and the tension eases up
behind them tommy keeps one eye on carrie
he shrugs its working goddammit and he stuffs his hands into his dinner jacket
carrie and frieda tommy and george right behind them head for their tables
the murals nice
confiding im really nervous
were sitting together
and she takes carries arm
norma watson rushes over to them all breathy taffeta and green chiffon
looking her up and down thats a lovely dress carrie

tittering moving away smack into frieda and frieda dont you look nice
toothpaste smile get douched norma
as the prom gets underway a josie and the moonglows the band make like lawrence welk and launch into an oldie but goodie
on drums the beak himself
b the twins cora and rhonda dressed identically dancing with c ernest peterson the black class president is wonderfully officious as he gets the evenings first entertainment organized
it or she is d sandra stenchfield and her fabulous twirling baton act a phenomenon to the lilting strains of raindrops keep falling on my head
e norma is off in a corner bending another girls ear stan is standing idly by pretending to be invisible
f morton fromm and the other chaperones including miss fish look for something to do for someone whos stepping out of line
and find it
in the person of freddy de lois whos guzzling the punch
g tommy and carrie sit at their table next to george and frieda
tommy lights a candle
as josie and the moonglows launch into a new number
george suddenly comes to life
he grabs frieda and they make their way out onto the dance floor frieda shrugging helplessly at carrie
george is funny
hes a good guy
beat see didnt i tell you
beat sure you dont want to dance
could we just sit here for a minute
tommy nods its okay with him
carrie turns around and finds herself facing collins dressed up looking more like one of the students than a teacher
you look very pretty miss collins
thank you beat you too
its awfully nice of you to say so
i know im not
but thank you anyway
tommy feeling like a fifth wheel clears his throat and stands up
to carrie be right back okay
he goes off into the crowd
gesturing to his seat may i
carrie nods and she sits down pulling the chair next to her
theyre virtually alone at this moment everyone else is dancing or occupied
carrie anything that happened before
well its all forgotten
i want you to know that
i cant forget it
beat but its over with
collins smiles she looks at the dance floor and carries eyes follow hers
at this particular moment the band is playing a quiet number slow romantic
i remember my own prom
i was two inches taller than the boy i went with when i was in my heels
he gave me a corsage that clashed with my gown
but it was magic
i dont know why
but ive never had a date like it ever since
is it like that for you
smiling just nice
i dont know
hesitating then its like being on mars
youll never forget it
i think youre right
and then on sheer impulse carrie reaches out and hugs her hugs her tightly
have a lovely time carrie
hey whats going on here
there is tommy looking stern
to collins what are you doing with my date
a smile at carrie and she goes off
dont let me catch you hugging any guys
hey listen do you really have to be back so early
no its okay
listen the other kids are going over to lewiston after the prom breaking in thats okay
you want to go with your friends
i dont want to spoil anything
hey let me finish
what i was going to say i mean if itd be alright with you what do you say we go to the cavalier
surprised shed love to ive never been there
well have the place all to ourselves
he means it then its settled
he takes her arm turns her toward the dance floor
holding back tommy
he has his arms around her and half spins half tugs her out onto the floor
he is a young man of considerable confidence the best part of his popularity and its a contagious trait
gradually carrie gets caught up in the slow dancing begins to follow him less and less awkwardly begins to get less and less self conscious and in short starts to
glide into her freedom
tommy and carrie dance into this corner carrie is a bit breathless and very happy
for some moments tommy keeps his arms around carrie looking at her
and then he leans forward about to kiss her impulsively
and impulsively and instinctively she draws back
and is immediately embarrassed
no harm no foul
they stand there for a couple of seconds
and suddenly and swiftly carrie kisses tommy
its a quick awkward frightened kiss
a bird peck
and again they stand there until i dont know
i cant dance
i dont even know how to
and he kisses her
she breaks looking up at him
why am i here
its the prom
because i asked you
why did you
because i wanted to
he pauses hes on the edge
and steps back
you liked my poem
only i didnt write it
someone else did
and shes about to ask something else
quickly look carrie were here were together
and i like it you know
i mean i
a commotion from the floor
carrie looks off following his glance at as the head custodian supervises the sliding of two thrones from the wings onto pre set marks on the stage apron
theyre sheathed in white strewn with crepe papers and flowers to match the proms celestial theme
uneasily its a fairy tale
beaming taking her arm cmon
he starts to lead her towards their table while sue snell unable to contain her curiosity about how all this has worked out pulls up in one of her parents
cars parks and deliberates coming in
the lights of the gymnasium are glowing
while inside class president ernest peterson makes his way to the microphone
he takes all this quite seriously
all right ladies and gentlemen
take your seats please its time for the voting
this contest is an insult to women
a couple of cheers scattered applause
it insults men too
louder clapping foot stomping whistles
over the noise please take your seats
its time to vote for the king and queen
several ushers go up and down the aisles passing out ballots
as norma watson haughtily drops a ballot on their table in front of tommy another in front of george
carrie examines the paper
looking up to see him smiling at her were on here
seeing her concern want to decline
do you want to
if you win all you do is sit up there for the school song and one dance
and they put your picture in the yearbook so everyone can see we looked like idiots
besides its the last year
carrie looks up at the stage at the massive thrones all in white
carrie meets his eyes and blushes its all overwhelming her and she has to look away at the tiny party favor boat on the table in front of her at
the tiny pencil next to it
who do we vote for
theyre more your crowd than mine
whatever you like
in fact i dont really have a crowd
lets vote for ourselves
to the devil with false modesty
she laughs aloud the sound of her own laughter is so foreign to her that she claps a hand over her mouth at her own daring
she takes the pencil and quickly circles their names so quickly that the pencil breaks bringing a small drop of blood to her finger
trying to smile but i broke it and it was a souvenir
theres still your boat
he pushes it gently toward her toot toot
as sue hardly in formal attire stares through the same small window in the gym door that carrie stared through earlier she stares inside as the ballots are being counted
morton and fish helping ernest separate them into piles
we ought to notice either de lois or trennant hanging around the voting tables perhaps norma watson as well
carrie is holding tommys hand tightly too tightly
dont know your own strength
he sees shes taking him seriously
sensitive to her reaction he smiles at her
hey its okay
in the background josie and the moonglows provide a flourish of drums
as ernest walks up to the microphone and almost drops the ballots in the process
weve sort of hit a snag
morton says this is the first time in the history of the spring prom that how far does he go back
weve got a tie
polka dot or striped
sixty three votes for frank grier and cora wilson and sixty three votes for tommy ross and carrie white
silence then the applause begins and starts to swell as we
tommys pov carrie an island in the applause around her her head lowered
watching her intently his mouth slightly open
vainly trying to speak over the applause
if i could have your attention please
tommy still staring at her
were going to have a run off ballot
when you get yours please write the couple you favor on it
slowly looking up seeing tommy
theyre not applauding for us
it cant be for us
maybe its for you
just exactly where they are isnt clear yet nor should it be
but we do hear the prom noises
i thought you said theyd win
wont even be close
if you screwed up
i called in a few favors
the black cuckoo clock striking ten as margaret mumbling to herself with the fixated attention of the damned continues to scrub a sliver of whetstone along the gleaming edge of
the knifes blade
as new ballots arrive courtesy of norma who leans over them and whispers breathily good luck
as tommy picks up the pencil carrie puts her hand on his
dont vote for us
in for a penny in for a pound
thats what my grandmother used to say
tommy hesitates for a second seeing her face so full of premonition
then he overcomes it and scrawls their names on the slip of paper folding it
he hands it to norma watson and its off spirited away gone
tonight you go first class
carrie stares at the receding figure of norma as if she were the messenger of doom
where we get a sense of exactly what chris meant by favors as de lois trennant and a once again completely wrecked kenny garson plus norma bring over more ballots
its not exactly what one would call an honest ballot
as sue manages to slip by fromm whos still lazily monitoring the door
she starts heading for the backstage area trying to be as unobtrusive as possible
at the voting table she spies sue coming in and finding it irresistible blurts out the news whispering to whos just finishing the ballot counting
he looks in the direction that normas pointing in seeing going backstage heading into the wings to watch as ernest returns to the microphone
the band plays another fanfare of drums
ernest sees this as his big moment he almost drops the ballots
he pauses for a moment surveying the gym floor and the anxious prom goers
an actors savoring the tension
then he smiles white teeth grinning tommy and carrie win
by one vote
begin slow motion silence
everything a half beat exaggerated slowed
carrie gasps inwardly the candle in front of her blows out
tommy grins amused
he shrugs his shoulders at carrie
and the applause begins some of it most of it genuine but some of it mocking too
the band launches into a rock version of pomp and circumstance
ushers appear at tommy and carries table
george is pounding tommys back
an aluminum foil scepter is thrust into tommys hand a robe with a fur collar is thrust over carries shoulders
peering out farther to get a good look
unseen at first by her theres a cord on the edge of the blocked by the clamor of the students hes unable to make a straight bee line for sue
in the wings
so he takes the long way around back behind the stage
dollying as theyre led down the center aisle past a blur of smiling faces the applause swelling
theyre being led toward the stage area the thrones waiting for them
the lights get brighter the music gets louder
as they pass by
the beak winds conspiratorially at carrie
as tommy gives carrie his hand helping her up the steps over tangles of black power cables
where we finally reveal just where chris and billy have been hiding all this time
chris listens to the footsteps of carrie and tommy coming overhead grasping the cord that billy has hooked up holding it very tightly
as theyre helped into the massive thrones behind them is the huge mural of stars and ships
the showman now p
barnum in all of his expansiveness
in the wings watching this action
in the corner of the frame the cord we glimpsed earlier the same one which chris clutched beneath the stage jiggles and sue notices it move
she traces its path with her eyes seeing that it goes up to concealing a single silver bucket meanwhile staring down at the gym floor the lights are searing so
hot and bright that its impossible to see clearly and a new set of spotlights being shone on tommy and her only makes it harder
as a piece of crepe paper lands in her hair
a sea of faces the spectrum of reactions
spreading his arms a politician
ladies and gentlemen i give you he king and queen of the spring prom tommy ross and carrie white
the band starts playing the school song and we
the implications of the cord and bucket positioned over the throne just starting to dawn on her as everyone begins singing the school song all o
all rise for the john f
and a hand comes into frame clutching sues wrist
it belongs to whatre you doing here young lady
trying to head for cord under stage somethings wrong
well raise your banner to the skyyyyh
but morton has no interest in what sue is trying to tell him ill say there is
from the throne she sees sue and morton and he pulls her toward the back exit
chris is almost hyperventilating as the school song continues
whats the matter with you
chris is frozen immobilized terrified
as morton firmly pushes sue out the rear gym door
the door shuts and as it closes confused wondering whats happening in the glare of lights and noise
locked out by morton trying to get back in
the door wont open
she debates going to try another door
as the song reaches its crescendo all o
with pride we wear the red and whyyyte
leering it can stay there until hell freezes over chuckie
chris shudders involuntarily at the mention of this nickname
she violently jerks the cord with both hands yanking it
a sound half scream half moan comes from her mouth overlapping into high above the stage slowly tipping over the blood pouring from it
almost proscenium like in this framing from all the way in the back of the gym
carrie and tommy sit on their huge thrones as the buckets above them deposit their contents on top of them
the blood splashing down
some of it splattering on the celestial cyclorama running downward streaking
as more blood splatters them in their white dinner jackets the music halting
end slow motion
tommy and carrie drenched with blood
preparing to leave now that their mission has been accomplished just about to crawl out as they spot realizing theyll have to stay put trapped now
nervous too hissing shut up
they crawl back under the stage out of sight
as the singing stops the students staring at the stage
her eyes tightly clenched shut looking as if shes been dipped in a bucket of red paint
shes gotten the worst of it
dangling on the pulleys over the throne clanging back and forth
a high pitched girls splattered with blood
below them the sounds of hysteria begin my god thats blood
tommy starts toward carrie just as as the bucket falls and hits tommy on the head it knocks him unconscious and he slumps to the floor
watching this in pure horror
she starts to giggle uncontrollably the kind of hysterical laugh that comes out of pure terror
it overlaps onto as the hysteria begins to spread
as she starts toward the unconscious tommy
as more of them start laughing
the sound of it becoming contagious
hearing the dreaded laughter
through the harsh glare of the lights laughing pointing see norma watson doubling up in hysteria utterly out of control
reacting to their success
putting her hands to her blood covered face slowly getting to her feet
as carrie makes her way to the stairs tripping over the black power cords
a horrified collins is on her way up the stairs
oh carrie let me help you
carrie hesitates at the sight of the teacher
but its too late for help and in the fastest flex weve seen to date she jerks her head and collins bounces backward down the stairs slamming into a wall
laughing harder now unable to stop
where all is pandemonium
morton makes his way to collins giving her his handkerchief she has a bloody nose
to morton call the police
tears streaming down her face the blood streaking as she takes in the sight of her tormentors
helen shyres is still laughing so hard that shes about to throw up or go into shock
george dawson has climbed on the stage and is hunched over the slumped figure of tommy ross examining him
call a doctor
hey call a doctor quick
he tries to pick tommy up and in the process the throne topples over on the stage
frantic rushing back into the school and down the hall toward the prom doors
takes a deep breath mustering her energy
she closes her eyes and sees all of them open a few students milling around them as
closes her eyes even tighter and flexes
and in swish pans slam shut
in the process several things are accomplished at once
the prom goers are trapped inside and one or two of them get their hands or legs caught in the doors as they close screaming with surprise and pain
who once again was just a little late arriving just as the doors slammed shut she sees the screaming prom goers unlucky enough to have been caught in the doors
utter pandemonium as students rush toward the doors
near the bandstand area looking up at the stage and realizing that its carrie whos responsible for closing the doors
fromm starts heading toward the stage to get control of the microphone to stop the panic
the kids continue rushing toward the closed doors
a small smile at being recognized by the beak as the one responsible the one with the power now
its not what she wanted but it no longer matters
theyre going to know her now and never forget her
between two sets of double doors featuring a huge firehouse installed in case of an emergency
seeing the hose getting the idea
note split screens begin here
as her eyes narrow and focus on the hose zeroing on it
as it starts to unwind to unspiral into the air starting to spray a burst of water
as it becomes snake like water springing from the nozzle
cries of surprise as it begins to spray water on them ruining their clothes
as the velocity of the water increases stronger and stronger
eyes gleaming a glimmer of triumph as she concentrates and surveys like rats in a maze a slapstick chaos as they try to get away from the animated hose
the water forces the students back from the doors backwards toward the stage
as they see students propelled toward them by the hose
a smile of satisfaction
for the first time shes showing them theyre the ones being made to look foolish
shes standing on one side of the stage
level headed to the end making his way through the pandemonium toward the stage area and the bandstand as fast as he can
still controlling the hose she spots ernest seeing him move toward the stage area
knowing somehow with some sixth sense that carries watching him
he feverishly hurries toward the area where the band equipment is plugged in
where the high voltage cables are hooked up to the electrical current
behind him fromm has reached the microphone and is trying to be heard telling everyone to remain calm
realizing just what ernest plans to do gently determined no
and she mentally fixes on him jerking her head just so
so is flung invisibly and forcibly away from the area by carries will
big belly and all trying to steady the mike
he puts his hand on it
the water however has reached him and just as he touches the mic hes electrocuted his arm bursting into flame unable to let go as his body goes into an
electric dance his mouth gaping open like a fish on land
watching this another flex and is propelled backwards from the microphone he falls backward into the cyc his flaming arm igniting it
a celestial fantasy immediately bursts into flames
it prevents any of the students from using the back exit
watching riveted with horror some of them screaming others frozen to the spot as the cyc crackles
her face flushed a vein in her forehead throbs her heart pounding
she spots hanging over the bandstand
as the prom goers press against the opaque glass straining to get out
fish in an aquarium
moving toward the dazed ernest whos recuperating from his bout with carrie
her heart pounding like an anvil
shes staring at she flexes
collins and ernest directly below the path of the lighting bar
we see the flaming cyc on the stage collapse forward
the light bar begins to shake
plaster drops and the light bar drops just short of collins head as far as its wires carry it
watching all this a giggle or is it a sob
emerging from deep within her
starts to swing recklessly around the gym
back and forth back and forth it hits the ceiling igniting it and the decorations
flaming stars and planets begin dropping from the ceiling
seeing their chance to escape while carrie is busy with the light bar
the back door which sue couldnt enter from the outside and which the cyc flames prevented any of the students on the gym floor to get to is now free
and billy and chris see their chance to escape
they burst out from under the stage as spots them
in the instant it takes her to wonder what theyre doing there its too late
theyre out the door and theres absolutely nothing she can do
as it swings catching norma watson in its path casually whipping this screaming girl in her green chiffon dress back into a wall
helen shyres is backed into a corner giggling with horror in shock utterly hysterical
students have climbed onto the back of the bleachers trying in vain to pry off the screens on the windows so they can escape
morton has grabbed a chair and is trying to smash it through another of the windows
all this to no avail
end split screen
as she makes her way down the stage stairs and out onto the floor
she spots the cord going under the stage first and realizes just how the trick was engineered
that billy and chris did it
moving aside as carrie walks through them an endless series of blurred hysterical faces
as carrie makes it to one set of double doors flexes them open and exits
as carrie exits the doors swinging shut
behind her through the windows we see a wall of fire collapse behind her
she passes sue in the hall whos sobbing hysterically
and as carrie exits sue runs into this inferno of fire to find tommy
and then the town whistle blows
it overlaps onto carries on her way home
at this point she looks less like a girl that the survivor of a grisly car accident wet caked with blood eyes glistening madly almost shapeless
she goes down a hill and then from as a fire truck rushes toward the school past carrie
and then shortly afterward out of nowhere billys chevy its headlights gleaming lurches forward its headed right for her
turns around and sees it coming toward her
chris screaming get her
at the top of her lungs billy grinning madly behind the wheel
as the chevy heads right for her standing in the headlights in its path bloated swaying back and forth her arms thrown out
almost right on top of her
flexing averting the car just as it almost smacks into her
it just misses her
billy is livid turning around to see carrie in the back window
just shut up
but the car is headed for an embankment
billy realizes this and starts pumping the brakes
but the cars accelerating not responding to billys efforts to slow it down
her head pounding flexing
as billy attempts to turn the wheel it too has turned traitor it wont turn
theyre heading right for the embankment
billys eyes are bugging out chris is screaming as plows smack into the embankment and rolls over several times
it then bursts into a sheet of flames
watching this explosion turn into a conflagration
we see the fire reflected in her puffy exhausted face brighter and brighter as we hear the sound of the whistle merging with sound of sirens and the house is
not even a porch light
in the distance perhaps the glow from the burning gymnasium
a figure is moving toward the house
it is carrie
carrie tries the front door
it is unlocked
she opens it partially
small voice momma
she opens the door wider
carrie steps inside
louder momma im home
carrie closes the front door
with the closing of the door carrie turns on a light
she looks around
the house is ominously empty ominously still
silence floods back in
carrie moves to the foot of the stairs turning on lights as she goes
she mounts the stairs goes along the narrow hallway to her room
carrie turns on the lights closes the door
she stares at the madonna child figurine on the bureau
then slowly she removes her blood stained clothing letting it lie in a heap
clutching a robe she goes into the bathroom
carrie turns on the shower waits for it to get hot
it is almost steaming as she steps in
very carefully carrie scrubs herself clean
then she steps out of the shower dries herself off briefly puts on her robe and turns off the bathroom light
whats important here is this gives us time to breathe to focus on carrie
carrie returns to her room
she is clean now her wet hair hangs
a feeling of despair about her or perhaps she is emptied out
carrie almost mouths momma
it is a little childs voice and there is no answer
she goes out into the hallway
carrie goes to the head of the stairs
once again she mouths the words momma
something a movement
makes her turn
she sees coming toward her
she flings out her arms and cries out oh momma
and throws herself against her mother holds her
a movement from margaret a quick movement hard to define
and carrie recoils her hands clutching her stomach
briefly we see the knife in margarets hand
then carrie tumbles down the stairs
on carrie lying like a broken doll huddled at the foot of the stairs
carrying the knife she stares down the stairs
it says in the lords book thou shalt not suffer a witch to live
dazed she sees her mother coming dimly everything distorted
she begins to crawl backwards her eyes always on her mother who is slowly but inexorably coming down the stairs
and now the devil has come home
whimpering momma its not right
carrie starts crawling to the kitchen
carrie crawls farther and farther from the door until she reaches the far end of the kitchen just as margaret the knife gleaming in her hand pointed toward carrie reaches
the bottom of the stairs and turns toward the kitchen mumbling all the while
carrie flexes the kitchen door swings shut
margaret is coming toward the kitchen
carrie flexes again to hold the door shut
but its no use margaret is relentless now and the door opens
she raises the knife and starts toward carrie the door swinging behind her
i should have killed you when you were born
momma i love you
please help me
sin never dies
theres nothing else to be done
carrie flexes and a serving fork dangling from a hook on the way suddenly hurtles through the air piercing margaret
it is followed by another and another as a rain of instruments strikes margaret
carrie horrified by what shes done starts toward her mother
and then she and we see sue standing in the doorway clasping her hand to her mouth stifling her screams
you tricked me
we were just trying to
and then something hits the roof rattling
a small sound
then a third
the stones are beginning to rain on the roof like hail
sue is rooted to the spot terrified
get out get out get out
the stones are coming down harder
all sound as one or two of them break through the roof rattle on the floor below
a stone of fairly small size crashes through into the kitchen
and sue stumbles backwards toward the door
sue is whipped around as though by a great wind
stones are crashing on the house
sue is hurtled out of the house
as a couple of larger stones crash into the room carrie heads for the closet
sue rising from the ground see stones crashing into the house
she begins to run away
carrie walks toward the closet the figure of jesus is illuminated welcoming her
she goes into the closet
she closes the door
stones crash down obliterating the scene
sue stops running
she turns to look at the white house
the stones are flattening the house
the house is being pounded into the ground
terror and disbelief
the rain of stones stops
then the house begins to sink slowly slowly slowly into the ground
and the ground is swallowing up the house
and covering it until nothing remains
not a trace
some time later a week perhaps two weeks after the nightmares of prom night
a home in the course of losing its family
white sheets cover furniture
boxes in the midst of being packed
eleanor snell looking incredibly tired is attending to the last minute details of moving
she sorts through magazines and books discarding some putting others into cartons
and she comes across the religious tracts left behind by margaret white forgotten until now
they have a momentary hypnotic effect on her
the phone rings startling her
she rushes to answer it in the kitchen catching it on the first or second ring
hushed voice hello
oh thank god its you betty
i dont think i could have handled one more reporter
she appears to hear a noise upstairs just a sec dear
she comes into the living room and looks toward the upstairs sue
a little louder sue
no answer she returns to the phone sorry betty i just wanted to make sure the phone didnt wake her
were all a bit edgy
sleeping too much i guess but schneider says thats to be expected after what shes gone through
he says shes young enough to forget it in time
as eleanors side of the conversation continues the camera conveys her tension
half of her is listening and talking to betty the rest of her mind is on sue upstairs
with good reason
because where the horan house used to stand now vacant
strewn with beer cans overgrown with grass and weeds and wildflowers
and a for sale sign
we pan over next door where the white house used to stand
it too is vacant but utterly bald theres been no time for anything to grow here
there is another for sale sign put up by born realty
looking utterly haggard and perhaps a bit on the loony side from a lack of sleep stands staring at the lot
shes standing there in her white nightgown barefoot
as she slowly walks toward it
underwater almost floating
we come closer on the sign which now starts appearing a bit odder less like a simple for sale sign and more like a grave marker
and when we get close enough we see that some graffiti has been hastily scrawled in chalk on the sign and below it in a second vandals handwriting some idiots
notion of one final joke as she kneels down putting the wreath shes carrying next to the marker
she proceeds to try to wipe off the red chalk with the palm of her hand it smudges badly
she stares at her hand fixating on it remembering carrie in the shower
suddenly a second hand thrusts into frame onto her nightgown
a bloody hand
a hand from the earth itself
carries hand it clutches a horrified sue by the wrist
sue begins screaming uncontrollably
the hand is trying to pull her into the ground
her screams turn into howling
but now in her room waking from what is indeed a bad nightmare
upright in bed screaming her head off her face covered with perspiration
eleanor snell rushes into the room to the bed embraces her hysterical daughter
its all right its all right darling
and we come in close on sues stricken face as her mother holds her calming her cradling her
closer still on sues eyes
