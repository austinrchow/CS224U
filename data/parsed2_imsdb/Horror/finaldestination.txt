href b b originally called flight by james wong and glen morgan january awaiting
each of us a cold
deny its finality
deride its totality
dread the inescapable inevitability
it will arrive
the black silent screen senses this moment before a distant blues harp introduces a contemporary bands cover of blood sweat and tears campy yet haunting gospel and when i die
as the introduction closes resonates
a flash of lighting
an airline ticket is tossed into frame beside a suitcase euro air
new york city jfk paris charles de gaulle cdg
departure thursday may
h arrival friday may
and when i die continues throughout the main titles swivels beside and open window
outside a humid spring thunder storm drops warm ominous rain
the figure of a seventeen year old boy alex browning packing for a trip passing the fan
a paris guidebook is tossed atop the plane ticket
camera pushes in on the book as the fans breezes flip through the pages
turns head swiveling away from the bed
stop flipping revealing a gullotine from the reign of terror
as an american passport is dropped beside the guidebook
swivels returning towards the guidebook on the bed
alexs faint shadow continues moving about the room
the fan head swivels away allowing the pages to settle
upon a louvre masterpiece francisco de zurbarans lying in the state of st
camera creeps in teasingly on the dark faced corpse
the pages begin to turn once again
there is more of a hint of conincidence as the blades whirl and head swivels
the boys figure passes blocking the breeze
stop dead on
jim morrisons decorated tomb in the cemetiere du pere lachaise
a pilgrim has spray painted this is the end
which in fact it is
of the main title
camera adjusts to fully reveal alex browning as he turns toward the bedroom door
alex is an average kid handsome
a high school everyman
one the wall amongst yankee and knicks posters hangs a pennant mt
abraham high school new york
the fighting colonials
alexs mother barbara walks in excited and a bit anxious
barabra contd tod and georges dad just called hes picking you up at in the morning
bus leaves the high school for jfk at noon
barbara moves towards the suitcase to help him pack
alexs father ken browning appears leaning against the door threshold smiling enviously at his son
my suitcase workin out for ya
alex nods and buckles it
barbara reaches in to tear off an airline baggage i
ticket attached from the previous flight
mom you gotta leave that on
the tag made the last flight without crashin or anything right
so it should stay on or with the bag for good luck
where would you get a nutball idea like that
is torn away from the suitcase handle
as barbara picks up the suitcase to place it on the floor
a dozen old baggage i
tickets spill from the outer compartment
she looks at ken as if you
the guilty party shrugs
im still here
barbara shakes her head as alex smiles at his dad
ken contd seventeen and on the loose
ten days in paris
in the springtime
live it up alex
camera inches into ken as he winks at his son
ken contd got your whole life ahead of you
camera creeps in as oddly the words strike him portentously
the storm has ceased
the room is quiet
as if itself a presence camera creeps across the dark and motionless room toward alex sleeping soundly
camera cranes down to the level of the bed until alex is in the f
and the room is visible behind him
on the rear wall the fighting colonials pennant begins to flutter slightly as if affected by the moving breeze
the path of which is continued toward the bed rustling the sheets subtly blowing alexs hair and continuing over camera
even in his sleep alex shivers from the passing cold
his eyes open surprised to be suddenly awakened
he considers for a beat then looks toward
which is off
perplexed rolls over toward his digital clock
the middle digit bar in the first zero faintly flickers so this time appears to read
overlapping attention airline travelers
this airport does not support solicitors
camera adjusts from the arrival departure schedule to reveal forty high school kids four teachers and several parents are gathered inside the international terminal at j
several of the students wear fighting colonial letermans jackets or hats and shirts displaying mt
abraham high new york
you are not required to give money to solicitors
alex gathers his bags as does his best friend tod waggner and his older brother george waggner standing before their father jerry waggner
for alex any psychic tension from the night before seems forgotten in the fun and excitement of the trip
alright you guys got everything
yeah were all set dad
murnau the french teacher any further description necessary
and leader of the class trip waves his arm
les estudients allons en france
does that mean go
tod shrugs i guess as he moves to his father and gives him a warm hug goodbye
waggner then gives his older son a hug

tod and george gives a wave as does alex who is slapped on the back by mr
take care of those two alex
the group begins down the airport toward the check in counter
in the f
before the boys strides a girl clear rivers reading the tropic of cancer
the loner in the group clear wears dark colors against the insecerity of her sex appeal
she appears aloof and more wordly then the other students
readying his ticket and documents tod flips open his passport checking out his photo
i didnt think anything could worse than my yearbook picture
now you know how i feel havin to look at you all the time
avis aux passagers
murnau stops the group
excited he cups an ear with one hand while raising a finger toward the public address system
entendez classe quest ce que cest lannounce
everyone begrudgingly stops to listen
vous netes pas dans lobligation de contribuer aux demandes des quemandeurs
is the class dickhead who mix and matches his role models in the most superficial manner
his hand is tucked into his girlfriend terry chaneys waistband
re murnau what the fucks he want
terry hot now but with no idea what time will do to her in just five years smiles obsequiously and mouths shh
cher aeroport nest responsable pour leurs activities
murnau scans the group his expression looking for an answer
clear rivers keeps her head in her book as
the airport doesnt endorse solicitors
tres bien clear
she doesnt react
her expression remains cool as murnau leads the procession forward
the boys continue
fuh ck do we have to put up with that shit the whole time
a hand reaches out to gently detain alex
he looks up to find a hare krishana dressed in everyday clothes but head shaved and a mark on his nose
death is not the end
camara pushes in on alex
unsettled by the soft spoken yet ominous solicitation
the krishana offers a small book reality beyond the matter vaishnava philosophy
as he hands the book to alex a female form enters frame between them
the women is miss valerie lewton a feisty english teacher whose figure inspires all the boys fantasies
it will be for you if you harass my students
she places a hand on alexs shoulder herding him to the group
pissy hare rama
lewton turns and while walking backward flashes a smile
mouths fuck off
as she turns her back and continues down the terminal
alexs passport and ticket are set into frame and picked up by a female ticket clerk
alex waits as she busily types into the computer and checks his passport
i have a few questions to ask you this afternoon
loud exaggerated plastic tiles rapidly click and clack
did you pack these bags yourself
the clacking continues demading alexs attention
his eyes turn forward
plastic tabs clack rapidly settling on the word
camara creeps in on his dawning paranoia
have your belongings remained in your possession the entire time
alex absently nods
clack clack clack
his eyes move to
the plastic tabs flip and clack rapidly stopping on
alex is still considering the messages
have you recieved any packages from persons unknown to you
alex quickly runs the day through his head and flashes her the reality beyond matter book
she smiles then leans over toward the baggage scales
alexs eyes turn toward
a new airline i
marker is attached to his bag
alex eyes the new tag hoping its good luck
as the clerk returns his ticket and passport
clack clack clack
same as your birthday
alex is puzzeled by the comment
he shakes his head if pardon me
camera inches into the ticket clerk gesturing pleasantly to the passport and ticket
four twenty five
your birthday is the same as your departure time
alexs eyes flash toward
the title settles upon
the ghastly green and reds of the x ray monitors flash as carry on bags flash through the machine
camera moves counter to the direction of the conveyor belt
the pace and excitement of the collective group escalates as departure approaches
carter horton and his girlfriend terry take cuts in line with smug bullying expressions
unseen by the chaperones no student has the nerve to protest carters action
alex tod george and billy hitchcock heavyset with a new york rangers jersey watches carter and terry with disgust
i cant believe they let that dickhead on this trip
his parents bought a ton of those trip certificates we had to sell just to get him out of their hair for ten days
excited tod speaks in a convert tone over alexs shoulder
dude i so worked the ticket clerk so youre sittin next to christa and im next to blake
alex looks up ahead of the metal detectors
attractive and they know it christa marsh and blake dreyer appear clearly out of alex and tods league
thats seven hours and most of it is in the dark
the boys dump their change in a plastic bowl
dude if we dont get someone going on this flight we should just call dr
kervorkian and put ourselves out of our fuckn misery
as alex and tod pass through the metal detector their eyes performing reconnaissance on christa and blake the opening drum blasts of boingos no one lives forever overlaps
camera adjusts from the sign indicating gate
the class is squirrely and excited
lewton and the parent chaperones are allowing kids to burn off steam at the gate hoping for a calm flight
camera moves along the awaiting passengers
carter and terry are making out a step away from heavy petting
blake and christa are flipping through parisian fashion magizines
billy hitchcock lays into a burrito supreme
camera moves to an empty seat
clear rivers enters frame and sits struggling with her walkman coffee books and a cassette box handmarked boingo a cheat that we hear the song as she places her stuff
on the unoccupied seat beside her a paris guidebook falls on the floor opened but face down
a passing unidentified student reaches down and hands her the book still open and face down
the student continues down toward the observation deck
clear looks at the opened guidebook
princess dis mercedes is totaled in a paris tunnel
besides the photo are two portraits of diana and dodi al fayed
camera inches in as she shakes off a shiver down her spine
she looks up from the book toward the student who handed it to her the identity of which is fully revealed to be alex browning
he stands at the gate window looking out at the plane
it is raining
in the distance muffled thunder rumbles
camera creeps away from the plane
huge seemingly incapable of flight and yet we unquestioningly trust our lives in this machine
lifeless and yet soon full of life
camera inches in on him
dude lets take a dump
tod moves into frame beside alex
man that is one george michael notch from being gay
dude get wisdom
were about to board a seven hour flight
the toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets
what if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torgue a wicked cable and then right after you walks in christa or
you want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes
alex takes a beat to consider
camera looks down on two stalls
alex sits in one tod sits in the other
over the airports p
system john denvers rocky mountain high begins
upon the mention camera cranes down turning twisting until finding alex in a straight on close up
he listens tense
he was born in the summer of his twenty seventh year
he died in a plane crash
announcment breaks into the song
ladies and gentlemen thank you for your patience at this time we would like to begin pre boarding of euro air flight to paris through gate
really for the first time alex appears a bit tentative and pale
it is intensified by the return of the song
its the colorado rocky mountian high ive seen it rainin fire in the sky
is torn along the perforated edge and handed back
looks down the paasenger ramp
camera creeps toward it
lit to cheat a feeling of no return
distant thunder rumbles
there is something more emotionally tense about the moment of boarding than take off
camera picks up ms
anyone seen billy hitchcock
howd we lose him
tod nudges alex toward the tunnel the three boys start down the ramp passing mr
murnau who checks his list counting heads
vingt huit vingt neuf
alex tod and george catch up to christa and blake excited
as always everyone becomes bottlenecked just at the point of entering the plane
alex looks out the ramps side porthole window toward the back of the plane
the enormous engine
the expansive wings
behind the tail distant a bolt of lightning flashes
just ahead in the plane flight attendants greet the passengers
he is next to enter the plane
a slice of opening from where the ramp meets the plane provides a sense of how high up one actually stands
camera pushes into him as he takes his first step into the plane
alexs nikes land on the carpet
its parents desperately comfort the child
camera adjusts leading george alex and tod through the aisles
alex and tod wince at the screaming child
george however feels comforted
younger the better
it would be a fucked up god to take down this plane
in the first row slumps a young man with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
a cannula is set in his nostrils leading to an oxygon tank beside him
the kids sneak sympathetic yet anxious glances at the man while continuing in their seats
george whispers over his shoulder
a really fucked up god
alexs tension increases as he continues up the aisle
camera inches in on row
seats h i and j
climbs into the row carrying his backpack
he takes his window seat and reaches up to the air flow valve
turns hissing air streaming full blast
camera inches in on him as he takes in deep breaths of the stale air
he presses his face to the window
gears whir as the ailerons are tested
camera creeps toward him face to the glass eyes scanning the plane and outside area
he turns toward the aisle
man they look great and theyre workin the sex appeal
could you trade seats with blake so she and i can sit together
i asked tod but he says hes got some medical thing
sneaks a quick check with tod
shakes his head
dont do it
he looks to them and knows he is just plain overmatched
alex shrugs sure
in front of him tod throws up his arms disgusted
alex climbs out of his seats
the girls are touchy feely thankful but only know guys dig that
youre so sweet
alex crames up into the aisles making his way to tod sitting two rows up in h
alex climbs over tod to take the window seat
clear rivers sits in the seat directly behind alex
cmon man like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck em over greenland or something
because of you i gotta sit here and watch fuckin stepmom
as alex sits the tray table falls from its upright position
he lifts the tray back up but as he turns the latch it breaks off in his hand
he briefly tries to jimmie the tray into postition then gives up
camera follows alexs hand as it rises
camera sweeps in extreamly close to the attendant call button
as alexs finger engages the button it lights up orange
the jet lurches
the begins rolling out of the gate
as he looks back searching for the nearst flight attendant
reads her book
another leans to look out the window
lifts a bit out of his seat searching for any flight attendant o
flight attendants prepare for departure
looking fore in the cabin
the flight attendants strap themselves in for take off
the engine volume increases in pitch and intensity as the jet begins to taxi
alex sits back as the tray over his lap
he looks out the window
appears motionless in the f
as the tarmac and runway signs roll past the window
the engine pitch rises
the engines whir as the jet gathers speed
he checks the window
is a blur
the airport terminals in the b
the wings lift angled as the jet leaves the ground
his classmates cheer and raise the roof
the trip has begun
camera pulls away from alex as if reflecting his easing of annoyance with the tray situation
he finally appears to notice the raucous reaction and settles back in his seat slightly pushed by mild g force
the upwarding angle increasing
the cabin buffets as if passing mild turbulance
the cabin sharply jolts
everyone tenses gasps
camera sweeps back to alex
and just as he clenches his backpack
the cabin bangs rocks
the engines spool to a stall
metal twists under extreme pressure
the cabin dips angles sharply to the right
unrestrained personal belongings fly across the aircraft into camera which buffets and shakes
deploy from the overhead compartments
a prerecorded message like that recorded by the black box of the crash of jal august blares over the p
with erie calm
fasten seat belts
put on oxygen masks
his hand trembles as he reaches for the oxygen mask and places it over his face
the engines resuscitate
alex checks out his window
the plane is on its side losing altitude
a slow sick spin
breaths deep into his oxygen cup
the jet engines grind and whir as if the craft were in the midst of a last ditch effort to regain stability the sounds deafening over the passengers cruelly hopeless
a devastating explosion erupts across the cabin blasting a five foot hole in the fuseluge
human limbs and blood spray craft and passengers torn to shreds
dead students sit lifeless in their seats
every unrestrained object on board flies to the hole and through the fire paper books luggage pillows
a parent and a student clutch their seat in terror screaming before they are pulled into the sky
dying engines a deafening blare
scream pale knowing there is no hope no escape as the engines die
the cabin begins to tilt downwards
then straight down
debris tumbles toward the flight deck as if falling from a cliff
the sick familiar sound of an aircraft going down
alex is strapped to his seat upper body facing downward toward the water
fire wind and blood whip across him
a building whine crescendoes before a second explosion rips across frame
dilating rapidly as the shock of what appears to be happening before him washes over his very psyche
drenched with sweat trembling in his seat his eyes dart toward christa and blake
they look great and theyre workin the sex appeal
could you trade seats with blake so she and i can sit together
i asked tod but hes got some medical thing
alex turns sickeningly disoriented
his eyes dart about searching for evidnece of the catastrophe
there are none to be found
alex blots from his seat startling the two girls
he scrambles toward tod who looks at his friend concerned
dude what up
frenzied alex climbs over his friend on top of the seat
alexs panic has alerted the other students and a male flight attendant who makes his way to the row
grabs the tray table latch before the vacent seat
it breaks off just as before
camera pushes into alex terrified
he begins to hyperventilate
is there a a problem sir
alexs wild eyes and expression convey no fucking kidding theres a problem
the flight attendant realizes this passenger is experiencing a serious episode
directly across the aisle carter horton and terry look at him with severe expressions
whats your fuckin problem
murnau and ms
lewton unfasten their seat belts and rush toward alex
quest ce se
quest ce se
the planes gonna obviously no one ever wants to ever hear that
the students tense
immediately turns to other attendants signaling for assistance with a quick definite gesture
in the b
attendants hustle toward the economy class cabin
shut up browning
youre not funny
frenzied begins moving toward the aisle
we have to get out
this frightens everyone
not the prophecy but his panicky irrational behavior
we have to get off this plane
camera pushes into her hearing alexs declaration
alex is desperately climbing over tod who is trying to calmly restrain his friend
across the aisle carter horton stands ready to quiet alex with force
take it sir if this is a joke easy
we dont tolerate such humor
the flight attendant restrains carter with an extended forearm
im not joking
im not joking
lewton and mr
murnau move to the seats
flight attendants try restraining alex from reaching the aisle
alex knock it off
settle down alex
listen to me
this plane will explode on take off
sir we will remove you from the aircraft if this continues
ill remove him
ill remove myself
carter reaches for alex who pushes back trying to get out
carter responds aggressivly and now the flight attendant tod and the two teachers are in the midst of the melee
the co pilot arrives to secure the situation
he grabs alex and begins forcibly ushering him up the aisle
a male flight attendant choke holds carter from the back
carter struggles but the attendants postioning has the advantage
he begins removing carter from the plane as well
he didnt do nothin
she follows the attendant hitting him to help her boyfriend
just arriving in the cabin billy hitchcock tries to fight past a stewardess to get to his seat
he is blocked by the mass of combatants as they are escorted out
hes had it anybody in the aisle is off the plane
no wait i was late
thats my seat right there
under protest billy gets pushed back off the plane
murnau and ms
lewton follow the pack of students and airline personnel as they move toward the exit calling out to seated teachers and parents while hustling up the aisles
everybody just stay where you mr
carpenter keep an eye on are
just sit tight

tod watches amazed and concerned for his friend
he looks across the cabin to
his brother gestures mouths

alex the co pilot carter the attendant mr
murnau ms lewton terry tod and billy proceed down the tunnel
billy is confused by the chaos
i didnt do anything
i have my ticket right here
arriving security officers quickly have control of the situation
alex is taken to a seat at the gate and dropped there by the co pilot who winded eyes the officers

the officers nod
one moves toward carter as he dropped in a seat away from alex
terry sits behind carter
the co pilot and attendants start back toward the plane
lewton hustles over to them and an airline representitive
no one gets back on board
thats my call
ive got forty students going to paris
during these negotiations
camera moves past ms
lewton and the co pilot to the boarding ramp door
clear rivers exits and takes a seat away from the others aware she is unnoticed in the confusion
camera inches in as she looks up toward
camera matches the move to him as tod and mr
murnau attempt to calm him down
youre off the plane
youre off the plane
rattled alex attempts to compose himself
lewton appears hurriedly pulling aside mr
airlines not taking this very well
theyll let one of us back on and the rest can grab a six ten flight
gets in two hours later at degaulle
its not that big of a deal
no you know the whole french thing

murnau understands this point and takes off toward the boarding ramp door
pleading his case billy follows murnau
i was in the bathroom
the lock was stuck
i didnt fight with anyone
hustling toward the door
murnau gestures toward ms
lewton as if talk to her
he disappears down the ramp
camera pushes in as airline personnel close the door
with an ominous thud
flight pulls out of the gate taxiing toward the runway
carter turns over his shoulder looking back angrily towards alex
terry wraps a calming restraining arm around carters shoulder but he starts towards alex seated with ms
tod races out of the bathroom with a dampened paper towel
camera follows as he hands it to ms
lewton seated next to alex
the teacher places it on alexs forehead
i called your mom and dad and theyre on their way
alex talk to me
alex looks at tod who nods
his friends expression is soothing and open
with lowered tense tone meant for only the two people beside him
i saw it
like i dont know
the plane took off
i saw it leave the runway
i looked down and saw the ground
lewton and tod exchange concered glances
and then the cabin banged and the left side exploded
the the whole plane
it was so real
exactly how everything goes
been on many planes that blew up have you
alex looks away
you must have fallen asleep
we get thrown off the plane and blow a half day in paris because browning has a bad dream
mocking alex its going to explode
its going to explode
fuck off horton
a raw nerve alex stands
only trip youre gonna take is to the fuckin hospital
carter scoffs while moving aggressively toward alex
carter makes a quick move and grabs alex
the two security guards rush in to break it up
chaos erupts agian as the two boys wrestle in the terminal
camera pushes into billy hitchcock depressed as he watches the plane take off
there they go and here we stay
one guard restrains alex another carter
in the b
out of the observation deck window
flight lifts off the runway
youre payin for my trip browning
i wish you were on the plane
in the b
the head and taillights suddenly violently erupt into a gigantic fireball of flame
it takes a few seconds for the concussion to hit the terminal but when it does
a window shatters
people are knocked off their feet
camera sweeps into alex
stunned as he turns to the window
the unceremonious speed of obliteration of hundreds of lives is cruel as flaming debris plummets from the early evening sky
camera pushes in on her rattled afraid but aware of alex as she is first to turn her eyes toward him
billy hitchcock walks backward from the window shocked by shocked step
lewton drops to her chair as her legs give out
the two security guards tear off toward more urgent duties
outside sirens wail as emergency vehicles race to the tragedy
camera begins to move toward alex
as tods head turns toward him then terrys
in the chair beginning to cry ms
lewton eyes alex as if afraid of him
the emergency vehicles strobing red lights reflect in alexs eyes now in tight as he looks out frozen with shock
upon the doomed flight
a pair of airline representatives sit with the seven survivors each numb with shock
everyone is too raw with residual fear to show any emotion
they sit on folding metal chairs in an empty room too bright from the fluorescent lights
beneath their obvious trauma resulting from the catastrophe
each feels uneasy by alexs presance
the others sit away from alex and tod
alex appears wrought with guilt
he checks the others out of the corner of his eye
lewton carter and billy glare at alex
terry averts her eyes from alex to bury her face in carters shoulder
frightened as anyone over what has happened tenses defensive and scared
with softspoken strength
youre lookin at me as if i caused it
i did not cause this
maintain their uncertain expressions
with strained apprehansion as if not wanting to dabble in the occult but needing an immediate answer
is everyone dead
are there any survivors
alex is taken aback by the question yet even his best friend looks at him for an answer
how would i know
you think im some sort of
hes not a witch
camera pushes in on alex relieved and thankful as he turns to her
camera matches the move into her as she looks up at alex not with fear or repulsion
but with knowledge of an unwanted but irrefutable connection
causing a startle the door opens
everyones head whips reflexively toward the entrance
the strange event of the flickering lights is quickly forgotten
a half dozen men and women enter the room displaying official badges and passes
all but two are dressed in casual clothing having been called in from home the pair being f
special agents weine and schreck
howard seigel and don hawks are representatives of the national transportation safety board
eileen whale and jack arnold are members of the euro air trauma team
the officials are sympathetic and calm exuding the confidence and security trauma victims look for at this time
im howard seigel national transportation safety board vice chairmen
weve notified your families and they are on their way
does anyone feel they need medical attention or spiritual counseling at this time
although the words are comforting being in the position of having to hear them macabre
lewton reacts snapping
have they found any survivors
whats going on
seigel is calm yet honest
the cause of the explosion is undetermined
nassau county authorities are on the scene
naval search and rescue are en route
and thats all we know
the group slips deeper into despair
we understand how you must be feeling at this hour
and although we know it may be difficult we must ask you some questions
regarding todays events while its still fresh in your minds
the survivors dread the thought of recounting the horrible experience yet collectively are ready to co operate
it may be valuable to our rescue attempts or any potential
the agents f
badges displayed in their pockets turn their eyes suspicioulsy toward alex
reacts puzzled as he realizes the agents are focused on him
are direct and professional with no hidden agenda in searching for the truth
seigel and hawks from the ntsb are behind them taking notes
checks notes listen to me
this plane will explode on take off
to alex how did you know that
camera pushes in as he looks up nervous
not about suspicion toward him but trying to explain what even he doesnt understand
i got this
a weird feeling
i cant explain it
did you take any seditives before boarding or on the plane
i saw it
i saw it
tears well as he grows frustrated trying to convey the unique experience
being trained veteran officers schreck and weine obsereve allow him to talk
not like a dream
more than that
i experienced the plane exploding
it was so horrible
i know what they all went through tonight
the officers remain quiet gauging his explanation
im not a pyschic
ive never had this happen before
the officers study him unsure yet carefully
did this weird feeling have anything to do with you saying you wished carter horton was on the plane
just before it exploded
alex looks up stunned
he didnt even recall this until now
whyd you say it
he considers owing them an explanation
the he realizes
never thought it would really happen
weine leans foward
if thats the case alex
why did you really get off the plane
camera inches in as alex considers confused emotional
camera continues the move on tod
as if just realizing
told me to keep an eye on alex
and i went to make sure alex was okay
a whisper he told me to get off the plane
displaying a similar sickened expression as tod
larry murnau told me to get back on
but i told him to go
pause guiltily i sent him back on the plane
no one forced you to get off the plane
you told us you arent friends with any that did
so why did you leave the airplane
camera inches in as she looks up
with total resolve
because i saw and i heard alex
i believed him
the surviviors have all returned to the room
they may be a group but they are alone with their thoughts
the door is opened by ms
alexs mother and father lead by a group of parents into the room
each moves with grief yet relief to their child
barbara browning grabs hold of alex and holds him tight
the mother begins to cry
ken browning eyes welling with tears grabs his sons hand and squeezes
alex does not cry
while holding his mother he watches the others
their parents are concerned but do not demonstratively show affection
carter appears as if he wants to hug his mother but he cant bring himself to betray his self image
his eyes moves toward
alone hurt that no one has come to take her home
his eyes find
jerry waggner holds his son both of them releasing anguished tears
through his grief however jerry stares at alex with an expression of anger and accusation
camera pushes in on him as he holds his mother tightly
a crack of thunder
alex sits in the back against the door looking out the window at the storm
clear rivers is pressed against the other door
everyone is slient
outside the storm angrily rages
alex is unaware that clear is watching him searching for some answer that she will not now find
she looks up
the car pulls over
thank you for the ride
she opens the door and flashes one more look at alex but he appears unaware
she exits the car and as the door shuts
the room is empty but the camera is slowly moving as if itself a presence
footsteps move up the stairs
alex appears his parents behind him
he clicks on the light sending a soft safe orange glow across the room
stands in the threshold of the doorway
his mother places a comforting hand on his shoulder
abraham high school fighting colonials
and now the tears arrive
he begins crying sobbing as his mother and father hold him
cnn broadcasts video footage of the disaster
seat cushions and personal belongings float in the harsh floodlights
it is late and dark
only the pale light of the tv spills across the living room
ken and barbara have fellen asleep but their son remains awake
alexs red eyes are locked on the screen mortified
a vicious crack of lightning and immediate thunder
as if calling alex to the window
he remains fixed on the tv
an image of hell as jet fuel burns on the ocean
as if furious at the slight thunder bangs
he turns stands
and moves to the picture window pulling the curtains aside as camera pushes in on him
it is as if nature is angry
lightning bolts spiderweb across the sky
a shard of lightning breaks across the front yard
oddly it does not make contact
in the split second strobe of lightning flash the bolt abstractly appears as if it were a hand pointing directly at alex
horrified lurches away from the window considering what he has seen
just felt on the roar of thunder
over black thirty nine days have passed since weve lost our thirty nine loved ones friends and teachers
wearing a dark suit and tie sits beside his parents on white folded chairs
his head is bowed guilty and sad
as each day passes without a determining cause for the accident we ask ourselves why
alex raises his eyes and looks across the ceremony
sits with his mother linda waggner and his father jerry
destraught jerry stares off blankly at the minister
ecclesiastes tell us man no more knows his time than fish taken in the fatal net
guiltily averts his eyes
ken notes this and wraps a comforting arm around his son
or birds trapped in the snare
alex checks over his shoulder
special agents schreck and weine subtly survey the area taking notes
although their eyes are beyond sunglasses the tilt of their head indicates they are watching alex
like these the children of men
turns away tense
he looks at the minister
caught when the time falls suddenly upon them
camera pushes into alex feeling eyes upon them
he looks up
is actually sexy and a bit scandalous in her black dress
still she is off by herself eyes burning at alex as if challenging him to challenge the words being spoken
self consciously turns away unable to face her let alone the words being spoken
and so before we can heal before we can escape the presence of death time we must mourn and celebrate theirs with this memorial
a student with a guitar and harmonica stands at the microphone
without introduction he begins neil youngs long may you run
two other students remove a cloth unveiling a memorial sculpture etched with the names of the departed
the gathered stand and begin paying their respects to the memorial
carter and terry appear in frame
terry holds a rose
as they move slowly up toward the memorial alex gets in line behind them
carter knows alex is there but will not look at him
hope you dont think browning that because my name aint on this wall
that i owe you anything
re victims all i owe is these people
turns to alex to live my life to the fullest
alex winces from carters breath
then maybe you should lay off the carter has an angry reflexive reaction grabbing alex threateningly by the forearm
terry immediately tries to get carter to release his hold
dont ever fucking again tell me what to do
i control me
carter and alex lock eyes alex refraining from showing any pain caused by carters grip
terry finally gets him to release
im never gonna die
he moves off
terry however holds a beat eyes alex and gently rubs the area of his arm as if this is the only manner she can extend her gratitiude in carters presence
as alex pats her arm terry quickly moves off
shaken alex considers whether to move foward to the memorial
he steps aside to let the others go ahead as billy hitchcock who has finished paying his respects spots alex and heads back up the line
i took my drivers test this week at the dmv
alex turns to him increudlously
lowest score but i passed
when i was done with the test the guy who drives with you during the test he goes young man youre going to die at a very young age
beat that true
not here not now
beat not ever
billy sighs and moves out of frame only to quickly re enter
if i ask out cynthia paster will she say no
alex flashes billy an angry glare
he gets the message and moves off for good
alex returns in line moving toward the memorial
valerie lewton places a rose at the base of the memorial then studies the engraved names as the students move past behind her
alex approaches watching her as she reaches out with a trembling finger touching the etched names
alex stands near her sympathetically understanding her pain
her eyes fill with tears and fear
alex places a comforting hand on her shoulder but she reacts quickly pulling away from him her eyes piercing at him
dont talk to me
you scare the hell out of me
alex is shattered as the teacher moves away
tod enters and faces the memorial
a greeting hey
alex notices tod is in line behind him
alex looks around for tods father
he is not in line
i dont want to sound gay or nothin but
i miss you
tod subtly nods reaching out to the memorial
tods hand moves across his brothers name
as tod longs for his brother then looks at his friend
beat but my dad doesnt understand
when hes better you and me road trip to the city
catch the yanks
thats a plan
the two friends stand uncomfortably foar a beat before tod gestures to the podium
i gotta go
this thing ms
lewton showed me in her class theyre gonna let me read it
it says what im feeling
tod holds his friends arm for strength as he passes
clear rivers appears in line holding a rose
she looks at the memorial before her startling eyes turn to alex
even away from these circumstances alex would have trouble handling her intense maturity
as he begins to step away she thrusts the rose to him
he looks up puzzled
because of you
im still alive
alex takes the rose and she walks away
camera pushes in on him as he eyes
the red flower
we say that the hour of death cannot be forecast
tod nervously stands before the assembly reading aloud with a sad yet optimistic resolve
camera pushes in at an ominous angle and rhythm to the podium
but when we say this we imagine that the hour is placed in an obscure and distant future
as he speaks the sunlight suddenly turns to shadow
looks up at the sky
within the deep blue a single black cloud blocks the sun
camera inches in as troubled he looks back to tod
as he continues to read
it never occurs to us that it has any connection with the day already begun or that death could arrive this same afternoon
storm clouds devour a waxing crescent moon above a modest home set amongst the edge of the woods
which is so certain
and which has every hour filled in advance
a lone light glows
jerry waggner has fallen asleep perhaps passed out reclined in dads chair
tods mother is asleep on the sofa balls of tissue on the floor
tod enters the room and stares sadly at his parents
tod picks up a glass and swigs the remainder of his fathers scotch before moving off and climbing the stairs
swivels as it distributes its breeze
sits at his desk dark circles beneath his eyes
swamping the desk are printouts of internet web pages and newspaper articles concerning the crash of flight forensic engineering textbooks ntsb reports on past airline disasters and
reality beyond matter vaishnava philosophy
alex studies his mountain of research increasingly obsessed
paper flutter draws his attention to the newspaper being blown by the fan
he reaches out and grabs it
headlines and photos report on the memorial service
camera pushes in as he sighs troubled
clear rivers sits in her seat legs crossed alluring and sexy and mysterious
closes the paper puzzled by his reaction
he shakes it off and throws the paper on the desk
alex considers for a beat then pulls open a lower drawer
digging through the mess inside he finds his stash
the april issue of penthouse
alight clicks on revealing an old s built bathroom
the toilet is beside the bathtub shower with just enough knee space to the counter cabinets when one lifts the toilet seat
tod puts the lid down and unsnaps his jeans
as he turns pulls his pants down and sits camera moves to the curtains
until a cold soft breeze causes them to billow
camera follows the wind as it continues into the room rippling across shower curtains
as the breeze passes tod he pauses
as if sensing but not understanding
this is more than a wayward autumn breeze
he moves to close the window however camera continues as the air makes its way to the door
the door is softly pushed closed by the breeze
tod sits back to camera which cranes down the tank stopping behind the locking nut and water line pipe
as the toilet flushes o
camera now moves into the locking nut which begins to slightly rattle
drips of water stream from the tank onto the floor
alex flips the magazine open to a centerfold
the models pose and expression tempt alex towards the momentary respite form his troubles
the caption beneath the centerfold pictorial reads tymme has come today
considers the reports on the flight crash then returns his attention to the magazine
he unzips his pants then pauses
his eyes returning hesitantly to the newspaper photo of clear
waits on the counter
camera pulls away as tod picks it up
he looks at his face in the mirror as if behind him
a black indiscernible form like a shadow however actually a presence incapable of reflecting light
tod whips around
a puddle forms creeping toward the heel of tods stocking feet
turns on the faucet and grabs his toothbrush squeezing paste onto the bristles
running water is out of focus
in the b
sits an unplugged radio
notes the radio
camera fllows his hand as he grabs the plug
grows closer to his foot
the radio plug is inserted
turns on the radio
and they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun
spooked quickly turns it off unplugs it and pushes it aside
continues to grow
odd how one can appear so erotic at a funeral
studies the photograph then notices the rose she gave him
succumbing to guilt feeling like the freak all teenagers believe they are alex sets the paper back on the desk
he grabs the penthouse and turns opening the desk drawer in order to return the magazine however
a loud bang turns alexs head to the window
an owl has apparently smashed into the window awkwardly flapping its large wings then turns its head toward alex large yellow eyes shining like an alien creature
startled alex reflexively throws the penthouse across the room pages tearing as it hits the sill
the giant bird flies off
swivels a page catching in the whirling blades
torn form the magazine flits across the room
camera inches in on him as the piece of paper enters frame floating and flitting until landing on his knee
he picks it up and turns it over
is torn in such a manner that the only lettlers remaining from the centerfolds caption are
is pulled aside revealing two pairs of linda waggners nylons drying on a retractable clothesline
his foot slips
tods hand tries to grab anything to hold him
his hand slips knocking over a bottle of shampoo
the thin clothesline coils around his neck
the plastic anchor wraps beneath the cord essentially creating a noose
he slips again
falls against the back wall of the shower stall pulled by the retracting wire
he kicks with his feet desperately trying to gain a footing
quickly reflected in the chrome
the dark shadow approaches
tods feet slip in the slick shampoo and water
blood vessels burst
he groans attempting to call out
tods parents remain asleep
a faint muffle can be heard
his hands tear at his flesh desperately trying to pull the cord from his neck
dart desperately toward the counter
a pair of nose hair scissors
chocking gasping face turning purple reaches for the counter
tods hand enter frame
the scissors sadistically just out of reach
falls into frame suspended by the cord propped against the back wall of the shower stall his bluish purple tongue grotesquely juts from his mouth
all four edges of frame appear to collapse as if by weight of the darkness until forming a myopic center
then from within the center
appears tods face
although the expression is serene the pallor is grayish until
tods face decays as if ten years of rot in the grave is compressed into frames
the moment of realization
kick upon the slippery basin
after a beat
as his body settles
camera pulls away fully revealing his lifeless form
once behind the toilet tank camera cranes down to the floor
the water eerily retreats from the floor slipping back toward the base of the toilet and like a murderer slips out of the night
whirl and flash into camera
camera cranes down adjusting to reveal a paramedics vehicle a sullivan county n
sheriffs patrol car and unmarked sedan
camera continues moving until revealing alex browning racing down the sidewalk
he runs into a close up sweating out of breath expression horrified as he takes in the scene before him
stand in the front yard
schreck subtly redirects weines attention toward
the boy franically moves to a paramedic
is tod alright
hearing this they turn to one another with an expression suggesting a deepening suspicion
sees the officers
assuming they are sympathetic to his concern he starts toward them until
alex stops looks around
behind the tree and in the shadows of the adjacent house stands clear rivers
a warning get outta here
camera pushes into alex stunned but before he can ask any further questions a metallic clacking draws his attention back toward the house
is rolled out of the front door by paramedics and an official with a jacket marked coroner behind the body follows tods father
he pauses in the doorway as he spots alex in the front yard
is pale nauseous
his eyes follow his friends dead body as it is rolled toward the paramedics vehicle
tods father approaches alex the agents stand nearby
waggner glares at alex accusingly
alex is stung guilty
he averts his eyes
schreck and weine note this reaction
couldnt you predict it
couldnt you read his mind
alex remains silent hurt
you caused tod so much guilt over george staying on the plane that
breaking down he took his own life
alex is stunned defensive
he wouldnt do it
waggner turns toward the paramedics van as if theres the proof
he told me we would be friends again after you got better
after you got over george
why would he make plans for the future if he were planning on killing himself
all my wife and i will ever know is we wouldnt have lost our youngest son
if youd told our oldest to get off the plane
alex is rocked as if having taken a punch to the face
waggner begins to walk toward the peramedics vehicle
alex eyes the f
agents who after studying for a beat turn and move toward their vehicle
the gathered spectators begin whispering to one another clearly about alex causing him to search for what appears to be his only ally clear rivers
clear is gone
everyone has moved away from alex leaving him very alone
alexs eyes remained locked on the peramedics vehicle
as the ambulance doors close on the body of his best friend
a soft summer breeze passes through the leaves on a tree
a yellow leaf drops from the branch and flutters to the ground
camera follows until it falls upon an old cracked sidewalk
a pair of worn nikes enter frame just as the leaf drops before them
the feet and camera hold until craning up to reveal alex staring at the leaf with an expression reminiscent of the torn papers message about
alex looks off toward a small unkept house nestled at the edge of the woods
in the open garage stands clear rivers amongst cluttered artwork supplies and tools
her t shirts sleeves have been cut off and neck line cut low
her jeans have a revealing hole at the spot which once was a back pocket
she wears heavy black work shoes
a dog rests nearby on the floor
its only the end of june
shrugs yeah but everthings always in transition
if you focus even now one week into summer
you can feel autumn coming
beat almost like bein able
to see the future
alex reads her intention loud and clear
she returns to her artwork
the dog growls softly as alex appraches the garage
entering the garage alex gets a closer look at her artwork
its abstract sculpture and canvas work and pretty bad at that
know what this is
she gestures to him to approach her
he tenses awkward but moves closer
clear lifts a plastic cover off a canvas
beneath is a mess of green and brown and orange teen angst poorly communicated
glued to the center is a twisted piece of metal
youre mad about something
she sighs thanks a lot then proud but not enough to make her appear foolish over her bad artwork indicates the metal
a piece of debris
from the plane
i went to the shore off the crash site and it washed up on the beach
you went there
ive wanted to go there but i thought it was off limits
but that didnt stop me
shouldnt stop you
alex gently touches the piece of the plane almost expecting to feel something more than cold metal
he looks to clear
why were you there last night
while she cleans brushes with a can of turpentine
look ive seen enough t
to know the f
doesnt investigate teen suicides
but they were there last night that means one they still dont have a clue what caused the crash
two they havent ruled out anything
and the fact that seven people got off the plane is probably weird enough not to mention that one of those people had a vision or whatever of it exploding
minutes before it did explode is highly suspicious
and it doesnt help that the visionaries friend just committed suicide
alex eyes her for a long beat
she turns away from him returning the can of turpentine to a shelf
why were you there last night
clear turns to alex
the two couldnt appear more different
she moves to a sculpture an ugly black and green globular sculpture with a white dot in the center
know what this is
alex cocks his eyebrow probably thinking a mess
but tactfully shakes his head no
remaining dry and stoned faced alex tenses uncomfortable
not a likeness
its how you make me feel alex
like you the sculpture doesnt even know what or why it is
reluctant to take form
and yet creating an absolute but incomprehansible attraction
uncertain and yet moved alex listens
before that day you were just another suburban nothing that would never have anything to do with my life
and im sure you thought i was some marilyn manson body pierced freak or whatever
beat but at that moment
on the plane
i felt what you felt
i didnt know where all those emotions were coming from until you started freaking out
alex sighs embarrassed
i didnt see what you saw but i felt it
okay im not into all that x files bullshit
but it was a psychic connection
why to me
why to you
jarred he eyes her frightened
and you can still feel it cant you
something from that day is still with you
i know because i can still feel you
alex is increasingly uncomfortable with the subject but eased by clears apparent somewhat understanding
lowering his tone
thats why i was there last night
ive never dealt with death before
i wasnt alive when my grandparents died
i wish i could know
i mean all this
could just be in our heads
now it feels like its everywhere
what if tod
is just the first
the idea sends a shot of apprehension through clear
is that something youre feeling
i dont know
i wish i could just see him
one more time then maybe
i would know
then lets go see him
alex reacts shocked and yet her impulsiveness is exciting
camera is low moving across the paisley carpet
dim light spilling through the stained glass windows falls upon the creepy decor appearing as if designed by a morose laura ashley floor model coffins and urns
camera continues tilting up to the ceiling revealing a stained glass skylight
outside on the roof two silhouettes appear
the skylight hinges crack open
clear leads the way
lifting the frame then dropping it throught the skylight window
alex is not as smooth as his socius criminus
using his knee to slow his descent he hangs from the sill for a moment before dropping to the carpet
camera moves with alex and clear through the unsettling reception area plastic flowers gold candelabra plaster cherubs and angels
a bronze plaque identifies mt
abraham funeral home
the journeys end
william bludworth intermediary
whispering gives me a rush
doin somethin im not supposed to
with a hot mischievous smile clear proceeds toward the hallway
alex anxiously sighs
an elevator with collapsible metal door lowers into frame
pushing the door aside alex and clear proceed into the hallway lined with morgue green tile
stainless steel gurneys and porcelain equipment holding yellow surgical tubing and thick foot long needles sit in the corridor
a faint light spills from beneath a doorway
clear reaches out to the knob but alex quickly grabs her hand
from a cart behind them he pulls a latex glove out of a box and snaps it on
alex tries the doorknob
he looks at her defeated
clear quickly points to some morticians tools on the cart
from it alex produces a thin six inch needle
he inserted the tool in the lock and jimmies the doorknob
a lone desk lamp shines
across the room laying on a porcelain table fluid draining tubes attached lies tod
a sheet is pulled up to his shoulders
he carries the macabre appearence of a corspe having been made up by a mortician
hair combed and sprayed skin tone too orange blush too rouge and lips too red
as alex and clear approach
but whyd they make him up like
thats him but
hes not here
that whatever made him tod is gone
suddenly tod jerks his hand lifting four inches
you fucking ohmygod
you think this hes not dead
is funny you fucking dick
tod if youre not dead im gonna fucking kill you
please dont yell
both are jolted again with shock turning toward the voice
camera pushes low angle into willaim bludworth an african american man early s dressed in dark suit and tie
youll wake the dead
he flashes a dry morticians smile pleased by his wan pun
alex and clear havent recovered from the corspes actions to calmly address bludworth
alex completes his question by raising his hand ala tods dead body
bludworth nods understanding
chemicals in the vascular flush create cadaveric spasm
as the startle of the situation settles it dawns on alex that they have been busted
he nervously offers an explanation
a friend of his
his best friend
see his father
ominous i know who you are
the mortician eyes alex understanding
alex senses this and eases
clear moves toward tods body examining the neck area
they said he hung himself but theres no marks
i crafted a reconstruction of the laryngeal prominence region with velvetone surgical wax and permaseal
clear moves in for a closer look then calls alex over to the body
after a beat of reluctance alex looks at tods neck
what are all those tiny marks
the wounds have been filled with wax and covered by greasepaint
at this proximity however it is apparent tiny cuts line the area above and below the large cut made by the wire
why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide
why would they say it was a suicide
if it werent
because of the supernatural message he recieved alex is reluctant to answer
he eyes mr
bludworth who with a wry half smile eyes alex as if aware of the reason behind his hesitation
his fathers pretty fucked up with denial
maybe he couldnt deal with the thought of an other accident
taking another son
camera inches toward the mortician
in this environment lit with fritz lang shadows bludworths tone appearance
he could easily be mistaken for personification of the subject
there are no accidents
smiles and no
you saying tod did kill himself
bludworth moves to tod on the draining table disconnecting the tubes connecting the body to the embalming chemicals
what does it matter
he was going to end someday
from the minute youre cut loose from the womb
its a one way ticket on a trip to the tomb
vile liquid oozes out of the body onto the porcelain table
you may not realize it but were all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail
every single move we make from the mundane to the monumental
the red light we stop at or run the people we have sex with or wont with us the airplane we ride or walk out of
is all a part of deaths sadistic design leading to the grave
the mortician considers as he drains some yellowish green fluid from the table
he shrugs then continues his work
if life is like a box of chocolates
death is like a big milton bradley game of mouse trap
the day youre born is just the boot hanging from the streetlamp kicking the marble to get things rolling
growing up is only the marble rolling down the curving chute
you feel immortal having survived school sex drugs n rock n roll but youve really only upset the big hand holding the steel ball that falls into the bathtub
marriage and kids and career seem to make it all worthwhile until the ball hits the see saw and flips the diving man into the big barrel
in the old folks home or the hospital you just see the big cage rattling down until it captures
beat game over
alex considers as clear eyes him conveying this guyss whacked
alex moves toward bludworth
maybe theres no way to win
if you figured out the game
you knew where the steel ball was rolling couldnt you avoid the trap and extend the playing time
cheat death at its own game
bludworth looks directly at alex
camera moves in on each individually
this between the two of them
you already did that by walking off the plane
now you gotta out when and how itll come back at you
beat play your hunch alex
if you think you can get away from it
beat but beware the risk of cheating the plan disrespecting the design
could iniciate a horrifying fury that would terrorize even the grim reaper
beat and you dont even want to fuck with that mack daddie
alexs eyes are locked on bludworths chilling pleasant smile
the mortician yanks on a tube revealing a foot long needle removed from tods spinal column
the horrific nature of death is vividly demonstrated to alex
im sorry we broke in
alex grabs her arm starting toward the door
we didnt find what we were looking for
alex looks at bludworth
yeah we did
camera pushes into the mortician pleased the message has been recieved
ill see you soon
braking loudly startlingly a public bus pulls into camera and stops
the doors hiss open
the mortician was whacked
camera adjusts as alex and clear step off the bus and onto the street
he was trippin on formaldehyde
clear starts up the street but alex grabs her arm and steps back assuring the bus moves off
he nods its safe to go
throughout the following his eyes are searching for anything potentially deadly
he said death has a design
even before he said that i had been seeing patterns
sarcastic as in flannels and plaids
up ahead scaffolds rise before a building being restored
hammering and construction work pound from above
in the f
tools and metal spikes
after a thumbs up gesture the rope is pulled up and out of frame
how many died on flight
from our group
remember the gate number
as clear takes a moment to consider alex steers them well around the scaffolds eyes skyward during the move
this is a creepy fact
even though past the construction alex checks over his shoulder to assure they are out of harms way
remember the departure time
reaching an intersection alex pushes the pedestrian traffic light button then steps well away from the curb
the halting red hand is lit
do you know when i was born
clear sighs growing impatient with alex
i thought you meant the time of your birth
four twenty five as in month and day
thats a reach
the halting red hand turns to the little white walking man
clear takes a step off the sidewalk and onto the street
alex tugs her back looking both ways while outraged by her challenge
my birthday is the same as of the time i was meant to die
thats a reach
a car indeed makes a right tearing through the intersection
once past alex takes clear by the arm and hustles them across the street
youre sounding like those people who you know
oswald shot kennedy from a warehouse and hid in a theatre and booth shot lincoln in a theatre and hid in a warehouse
camera holds revealing an unmarked sedan parked across and down from a starbucks with outdoor seating
schreck and weine sit in the car eyes coolly locked on alex and clear
billy hitchcock rides toward the starbucks on his bicycle
sitting outside alex hunches over the table increasingly anxious
clear listens expression skeptical
im not just layin down a bunch of math here with this
im talking about indications
that day that we were meant to die
that if we have been aware of
would have saved everyone on the plane
thats total bullshit
you can find death omens anywhere you want to
she picks up her paper coffee cup
coffee starts with a c and ends with an e
so does the word choke
were going to choke to death
starbuck was a whaler
were going to be harpooned
alex angrily glares at clear
clear drops her tone
youll go nuts if you start with that shit
lewton appears from around the corner
she starts toward the entrance but pauses tensing when she sees alex
he cautiously flashes a greeting smile
the teacher however averts her eyes and continues into the coffee shop
alex sighs guiltily
clear sympathizes with both of them
shes leaving the school
alex studies appealing to her
clear how do we know that by just sitting here breathing this air or sipping the coffee having crossed the street
we havent started in motion the events that will lead to our death
fifty years from now
beat you dont unless
youre able to open yourself to the signs im willing to show you
he leans foward removing a peice of paper from his pocket
slides across the table
opening his hand reveals the piece of paper reading
clears hand enters frame to take the paper
camera follows as she raises it her expression obviously puzzled
as she eyes alex for an explanation camera cranes down quickly to the empty paper cups on the table
a slight approaching breeze knocks them over
a somewhat cherry s muscle car speeds in the direction of the starbucks
carter horton is driving
terry chaney rides shotgun
carter looks out the window
she holds the paper as alex apparently explains the story
carter scowls his anger rising as he slows staring at the perceived reasons for his problems
her eyes turn from the paper to alex concerned about him
i dont understand
did you see tod die
did it happen again like on the plane
no but it might as well be the same thing
this was a message
from someone or something
at the design
alex on the plane
you must have experienced
some kind of hyper awareness
youre suggesting tods death
and maybe our own
will happen because of
an active presence
alex nods feeling shes understanding
the mortician said death has a design
if you me tod carter terry billy ms
lewton messed up that design because for whatever reason i was able to see deaths plan
then we cheated it
beat but what if it was our time what if we were not meant to get off that plane
what if it is still is our time
is still not finished with us
we will all still die now not later
troubled and deeply concerned clear studies alex
we find the pattern
and cheat it again
clear sets the paper down looking sadly at alex
after hearing you just now
i do believe
alex leans back and sighs relieved
that tod killed himself
alex is taken aback hurt and angry
then theres no one left who can help me
his eyes having never left alex carter suddenly cranks the wheel hard to the left to make a tight u turn
rides his bike
he reacts startled by
barreling down towards him
the car cuts in front of the bicycle to complete the u turn
billy swerves to the left directly in front of an oncoming car
the car swerves right as does billy avoiding a certain fatal collision for the cyclist
the oncoming car honks
carters car pulls up to the curb
oblivious to the accident he almost caused carter gets out strutting toward the tables outside the coffee shop
inside the car terry sighs
baby come on
but her boyfriend continues
she gets out and hustles after him
their attention drawn by the commotion clear and alex watch carter horton approach them followed by terry who stops irked near the curb at the crosswalk
at that moment ms
lewton exits with an ezpresso drink
sensing trouble she has no energy or desire to involve herself
kind of have a reunion here
let it go
carter steps before ms
lewton blocking her exit
when are you moving
a couple of weeks
she cant wait to leave
while trying to walk around carter
were losing our favorite teacher
look theres something you should all know
carter eyes alex continuing the taunt
he raises the volume of his words to drown out alexs words and incite conflict
lived here her whole life
thisll be hard to believe
lewtons eyes flash to alex afraid of him
and now she has to move
listen to me we may all all because of browning
be in danger
the both of you
the two boys stop their heated exchange
beat get over it
i wont let that plane crash be the most important thing in my life
im moving on carter and if youre gonna waste your life beating the shit out of alex everytime you see him then you can just drop fucking dead
head and shoulders remaining angrily in carters direction terry takes a blind step off the curb and into the crosswalk without a cut
a bus suddenly speeds into frame and thud
plows directly right into her
are splattered with blood before they can even recoil
fizzles in the glass while o
a phone rings
has crashed watching cnn
its a tense recline
red circles rim the lids of his eyes
he sips from the glass to settle his stomach
ken appears from the kitchen hand over the reciever
its that girl
no response from alex
ken sighs then into the phone
hes in the shower clear
can i have him get back at ya
ken returns to the living room concerned about his son
alex averts his eyes stressed and ashamed
ken sits nearby
shes concerned about you
beat im concerned about you
alex turns his eyes to the glass
why dont you want to talk to her
you and mom have helped me out so much
some things i need to understand before i can talk
to anyone about it
the father respects this young mans wishes
ken nods fair enough
in the silent moment o
from the television
the national transportation safety board has a new theory tonight on the possible cause of euro air flight
alex quickly grabs the remote and turns up the volume
a computer graphic illustrations the area of the lower fuselage
deterioration of silicon insulation on an electrical connector to the scavenger pump may have leaked combustible fluids
alex remains riveted to the screen
a spark in the fuel switch
the graphic zooms into the area in the rear right side nearly above tods seat
thats tods seat
camera pushes in as he listens
may have ignited the fuel line
and proceeded to the fuel pump
the high tech computer image traces the path of the explosion through the plane
a red line representing the fuel line zigs through the body of the plane making a sharp turn forward to the fuel pump which explodes
jagged lines show the direction of the explosion moving backwards toward the rear of the plane
drawn in alexs hand and hundreds of steps down from cnn computer image yet accurate as alexs finger traces the path away from the seats marked me and clear
the path starts over tod then moves to terry
the line moves forward away from carter toward the fuel pump
the corresponding jagged picture of the explosion back is reminiscent of the hand of death seen earlier in the lightning
it is a graphic demonsration of the arbitrary nature of death
is amped intensely more frightened as he believes
the path of the explosion
a whisper thats deaths design
it instantly frightfully occurs to him he now knows who will be next
alexs finger quickly moves along the fuel line
after terry the seat intersecting the path of the fule line over the fuel pump is marked ms
enters frame on the phone wearing a t shirt and sweats
some nights im woken up by the sound of my own voice you know inside my head goin no you know the whole french thing
get on the plane
moving boxes are stacked in the living room organized disarray of relocating
the house is old been in the family forever
dust marks the walls where framed photos and artwork were once displayed
everything here reminds me
of sending mr
murnau back on the plane
right im hoping a change will help
i lived here my whole life and wherever i looked were great memories you know
but now all i can see is mr
just looking out my own front yard
makes me feel mothing but fear
she peeks out of the front curtains and looks sadly upon her front yard
her expression alters
the figure is alex browning
lewton steps away from the curtains
quickly laura i gotta call you back
she immediately hangs up and speed dials
this is valerie lewton
i need agent schreck
alex has moved closer to her house remaining in the shadows
he checks for any passers by
being sure there are none he creeps toward ms
he visually inspects the exterior
as he kicks the tires
an unmarked sedan screeches up
startled alex turns to find
special agents schreck and weine standing in the street backlit in the strong headlights of their car
what are you doing
is nervous but determined
he tells the truth
checking the air in her tires to make sure theyre safe
after a beat of incredulity
get in the car
is watching peeking out her front curtains
car doors close
the vehicle roars off
she releases the curtains and moves back feeling somewhat better but still rattled
the curtains billow as if blown by a breeze
lewton appears puzzled as she moves the curtains aside to find the windows closed
as camera pushes in on her tensing and uneasy
alex sits behind a table in the cinderblock room painted police station green
sitting across from him with a good cop tone is agent weine while schreck stands with a hard ass posture
i believe that
see theres this
sarcastic oh youve noticed it too
lewton moves to a closet door opens it and clicks on an overhead light
kneeling down she tugs on a heavy box and opens it to check the contents
her expression warms as if recalling a far off memory
she slides a vinyl record album out of the sleeve and moves to the turntable on a shelf thick with dust
valerie places the record on the stereo and sets the needle on the album
camera sweeps in close to the turntable although spinning around and around
the bold letters of the center label can be read
the opening acoustic guitar of rocky mountain high has never sounded so eerie
he was born in the summer of his twenty seventh year
pleased with the feeling of a pleasant memory lewton moves off
schreck moves closer to alex
whered you get this pattern from
you have another vision
maybe saw it in some t
alex is insulted by the condescending tone
i didnt ask for what happened to me on the plane
you can make fun of me
you can think im a nut
im used to it
i saved six lives but the entire school acts like im a freak
alex takes a nervous breath
im not suffering from post traumatic stress
i havent developed a narcissistic deity complex
im not going dahmer
beat this just is
theres a pattern in place for you
theres a design for everyone
the agents study alex
sighs and im not sure yet how
but i intend to break this one
held in a wooden block sits atop the kitchen counter
in the b
valerie removes the chrome teapot from the stove and moves it to the sink
john denver continues in the next room
lewton turns on the faucet pours water into the kettle
some water spills on the side of the kettle
as she wipes the pot with a blue checked hand towel a dark shadow appears to cross behind her
camera follows circling as she looks about the room only to find she is alone
unsetteled she absently tosses the towel on the counter the edge which catches a knife blade held in the cutery block
lewton turns on the gas adjusts it however
the flames blow out
she pauses nerves on edge
her eyes cautiously move about the room and find nothing
she grabs a pack of nearby matches and strikes one
he left yesterday behind him you might say hes born again
camera pushes into the burner as the flames re ignite and fill the frame
weine sits across from alex symapthetic but professional
alex you got our attention at first because you were under suspicion in the plane explosion
alex tenses but weine shakes his head
i know you didnt blow up that plane
alex sighs eases
i dont believe you have magical powers
no one has any
control over life and death
that person is taking lives and causing death
weine leans forward toward alex
can you promise me that no one else will die
as long as im in here its outta my control
the agents are taken aback by his answer unnerved by his sincerity
weine sighs and looks to his partner who sighs frustrated and turns away
alright go on
get outta here
alex stands and with no urgency moves off
he exits the room
kid gives me the creeps
we got nothing to hold him
i dont mean that
beat theres a couple of times there
i almost believed him
weine considers yet remains skeptical
sometimes you give me the creeps
when he first came to the mountains his life was far away
two tea bags are dropped inside then the steaming hot water
picks up the cup raising it toward her lips
she pauses her expression turning tragic
on a reflex she spins toward the sink and throws the hot contents into the drain
she sits the mug down
displaying the logo of the mt
abraham fighting colonials
she takes a deep breath getting a hold of herself
you gotta stop this
its just a stupid mug
composed youre outta here
youll be gone
opening the refrigerator frezzer she grabs some ice and a bottle of pure polish vodka then deliberately turns back toward the same mug
the ice cubes plunk
the cold alchohol pours into the hot mug
camera pushes into the mug as
it slightly cracks vodka dripping out of the base
lewtons hand picks up the mug oblivious to the crack
she moves off toward the living room leaving a trail of alcohol
alex exits the police station walking
he checks over his shoulder to see if he is being watched and increases his pace legs whipping across frame
valerie lewton tears off a piece of plastic bubble wrap
she stands over her desk placed against the wall
on the desk is her desktop computer monitor
its the colorado rocky mountain high
she pauses to swig from her cup of vodka
alcohol drips from her mug
fluid drips inside the circuitry
sets the mug out of the way on the back edge of her desk
the remaining vodka oozes from the crack pools then drips off the edge of the desk
ive seen it rainin fire from the sky
camera cranes down to reveal the moniter cabel inserted into an electrical wall socket
the vodka drip
drips past frame
then lewtons hand enters and pulls the monitor plug creating tiny sparks at the connection
the alcohol ignites
her back is to the desk while pouring styrofoam peanuts into the box
in the b
flames nearly supernaturally leap up the walland toward the computer monitor
the interior catches fire causing an electrical pop
turns holding her sheet of bubble wrap shocked by the flames
on the screen the reflection of the approaching shadow passes before the monitor
a large jagged shard from the monitor flies into her throat
blood squirts from her neck onto the bubble wrap
her stunned expression is sickeningly numb from shock
rocky mountain high colorad oh
she reaches up to reflexively pull the glass from her throat creating a flood of spurting blood
she drops the glass and quickly stumbles toward the kitchen blindly banging the turntable as she passes
the needle skips bumps
umercifully at the start of rocky mountain high
alex walks quickly up the street
smoke wafts before him
he turns to see a man burning leaves in the backyard
the breeze intensifies lifting the burning debris
the smoke swirls around him
camera pushes into alex as he senses the presence
he looks ahead
mystically float past him each on fire
senses the taunting message and breaks into a full sprint passing through many of the burning leaves that break up into the bright orange cinders against the black sky
reach the coffee mug igniting the trickling stream leading to and away from the crack in the cup
flames ride the small trickle of vodka back toward the kitchen
valerie lewton races in desperately pressing her hand to her throat as she gurgles and chokes on the blood from the wound
she leans over the now red sink
she turns pale from the blood loss
the flaming stream shoots up the stove lighting the burners
behind her the stove erupts in flames
they jump leap like a tiger landing on her shoulders and hair which catch on fire
alex approaches the front of the house
from here nothing appears to be wrong
as he catches his breath sweating visually examining the house
from inside a hoarse macabre scream
camera pushes in on alex stunned before he races off toward the house
drops into frame on her kitchen floor hair and sweatshirt aflame
she desperately rolls on the floor and manages to extinguish the flames
on her back on the floor she is badly burned
her open neck wound continues to bleed
blood pools on the floor
in shock and moving on pure survial instincts she reaches up
the lower third of the towel dangles over the edge of the counter top
her hand grabs it and pulls
the draped edge of the towel pulls over the cutlery block
the knives spill out entangled with the hand towel
alex rushes across the threshold as ms
lewton pulls the knives over the counter
a half dozen knives from small but sharp cutting blades to large butcher knives cascade into her body
they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun
her hand trembling her expression horrified lewton grabs the handle of the largest blade trying to pull it out
alex quickly kneels next to her
she looks at him in shock her eyes pleading
alex gathers his courage places his hand on the handle of the largest blade
as hes about to remove it
a gas line erupts creating a small explosion
the cutlery block is knocked off of the counter
the block lands directly on the butcher knife handle driving the blade further into ms
descends the frame collapsing until her face eerily peaceful but lifeless gray horrifically decays
flesh rotting worms feeding on muscle until only a skull remains
as death arrives her eyes are macabrely focused above her
even as blood squirts on him from her open wound he appears to realize she is seeing the moment of death
flames leap from the stove to the curtains which catch fire
alex grabs the knife and pulls it out
he quickly removes another and another
yet there is no reaction from the woman
knowing she is dead alex pauses with guilt
he looks at the knife in his hand then realizes how incriminating this could appear
in that moment another small explosion from the stove brings alex quickly to his feet
he drops the knife to the floor and races from the house
camera tilts down to the shoe prints left in the pool of blood
alex runs with all his strength away from valerie lewtons home
billy hitchcock is riding his bicycle in alexs direction
he stops and gets off his bike
alex appears unaware as he simply runs past billy who curiously turns his head to watch alex race up the street
the crackling of fire
camera moves into billy as he turns back reacting with shock to ms
from inside an intense explosion propels glass from the windows
flames engulf the entire house
even down the street he is knocked to his feet by the blast
in the distance sirens from approaching police and fire trucks are heard
he stands looks to the now suspicious billy
then opts to run off away from the scene
escaping into the dark backyards of the neighborhood
tense her eyes look left then right
i dont know where he is
hes not talking to me
agents schreck and weine stand before clear in her garage
she studies the men before averting her eyes
because i didnt believe him
the agents study her
weine accepts the explanation
schrecks eyes take a walk around the artwork in the garage pausing on a piece of twisted metal from the crash
clear tenses however
if he should contact you it would be in the best interest of your own safety to contact us
schreck hands his card
she takes it and nods
schreck pauses once again eyeing the painting before moving out of the garage on their way to their car
camera pushes in on clear as she looks at the business card
camera pushes in on flight memorial lit for dramatic effect at night but only achieving an eeriness
carter horton and billy hitchcock enter frame moving toward the monument
billy is riding his bicycle wearing a new york rangers jersey with hitchcock across the back of the shoulders
nearing the shadows the two boys stop looking at the monument
carter pulls put a heavy pocket knife and starts attempting to cut into the stone
clear rivers appears from the shadows
what are you doing
terrys name should be on this wall
clear is touched by the action
so whyd you want us to meet you here
theyre watching me see if i go to alex
theyll follow my car
beat thats why youre taking me
why would i want to see him
clear eyes the two of them
with the memorial standing behind them
because he knows which one of us is next
as carter and billy feel the chill of their inner fears
the muscle car roars onto u
a sign near the road indicates middletown mi
new york city mi
carter checks the rearview mirror
clear looks out the front passenger window
she shakes her head as if no ones following us
billy leans forward from the backseat
drive the speed limit right
he sits back out of frame but quickly darts forward
and dont pass on the right
im gettin a vision
youre the next one
nervous hey man whyd you say that
cause if you say another word im gonna fuckn kill ya
billy sits back gesturing hear ya
clear pays no attention to their exchange as she stare out into the darkness her thoughts a million miles away
a posted sign indicates accident site
any debris found should be reported to the ntsb ntsb
camera finds carters car pulling up to a stop
clear opens the passenger door and pauses in the car a while
he could be anywhere from here to a mile down the shore
you guys drive down there start this way and well meet around the middle
itll take half the time
clear closes the door
carter and billy drive off
as she looks to the beach
camera facing the ocean moves along the shore revealing a lone image sitting on the beach looking into the atlantic
the waves are small bur rhythmic an enternal metronome
numb alex browning sits in the sand searching for an answer somewhere in the darkness of the evening sea
behind him o
approaching in the sand soft footsteps
he listens notes them
yet rather than turn around
he looks up into the sky
the shoreline lights cast an orange haze on the stars breaking through infinitely above
are they up there
clear rivers approaches barefoot in the sand
he neddnt turn to know who is behind him
is still in flight
are they still safe
clear hasnt met eyes with alex but she sits nearby looking into the sky
when i was a kid like six or seven
i used to worry so much about my parents dying
like lying awake at night
i loved them so much
i didnt want them to get hurt
and what would happen to me
what would life be like
beat every night
she looks out at the stars
he doesnt eye her either
most kids do i guess
most kids never have it happen
alex hangs his head
when i was ten
my dad went into a for cigerettes
i guess he heard somebody say dont turn around
so on reflex or thinkin a friend was jokin
and the guy blew his head off
she has lived this so many times she is long beyond crying
and let me tell ya i had every reason to worry before
because life became shit
i dont blame her i guess but my mom couldnt deal with it at all
she married this asshole who my mom with my real dad would cross the street to avoid this guy
he really didnt want a kid
and so my mom didnt either anymore i guess
beat if that was the design for my father
and my family
then fuck death fuck it
the waves continue to shore
clear looks up at the sky
and so anyway
ive thought of that somewhere alex
it exists that place
he looks at her
where my dad is still safe
where he had a full pack of cigerettes and kept driving
a place where me and my dad and my mom
are still together
and have no idea about this second life here
beat a place where our friends are still in the sky
where everyone gets a second chance
she looks at him
but that place might only exist in my heart
and maybe now
i havent experienced too many second chances in my life
i havent seen any
but because of all of this i believe
because of you
i will get a second chance
because of me you will
with you in my life
that place right now existing in our hearts will spring out
and become a real part of this life
alex looks within her as a soft ocean breeze blows through clears hair
and that is the only way we can beat death
by making something special out of life
his eyes well with tears
only as she looks at alex does clear become emotional
they move closer and kiss the desire for each other to defy the events around them darkness the isolation
they dive into a deep feverish kiss
embracing as if the tighter the safer
she pulls him back down to the beach and lifts his shirt over his head
this wont be safe
clear looks down the beach checking for any sight of billy and carter
those guys are probably fifteen minutes away
i mean i dont have anything on me
this wont be safe
sadly nothing is
alex looks to clear then kisses her with passion that reflects the defiance of death
he pulls open her shirt and falls into her arms
camera cranes up as the young man and woman make love in the sand
consciously and defiantly oblivious to anything around them
including the stars possibly flight up above
billy rides shotgun
alex and clear are in the back
everyone anxious looking for cops
i cant go home
after lewtons theyll be after me
were takin you to a cabin in the woods its only a couple miles from my house
to carter keep off the highways theyll be lookin for us
carter however continually glances into the rearview mirror checking alex
finally hotheaded and unable to withhold it any further
alright browning you fuckin warlock
did you know about ms
lewton or what
why do you think i was hiding
billy told the f
he saw you runnin away from her house
they blame me for everything
her tod the plane crash
your shoe prints were in the blood
your fingerprints on the knives
i already told you
interrupting im not talkin about if you did it
or if you knew she was dead
beat did you know she was going to be next
before she was
alex looks at clear her expression asking the same question
almost to himself when she died
at that moment i could tell she saw something
the three others turn quiet considering what it must be
out of us
whos next to see it
alex eyes them
hesitant to respond
please tell me im gonna get to see the jets win the super bowl
thats why youre not saying
billy looks out the window despondent
shoulda felt up tammy in the pool that time
to billy whatta you whinin about
he said im next
he didnt say nothin
you have a responsibility to tell me
is knowing going to make it easier
it makes it harder
you get off havin control over me
let me choose how to deal with it
it doesnt matter whos next
were all on the same list
the three are silent
carters expression becomes frightened but he cannot have this
he counters with an irrational bravado
then why bother
whats the fuckin point
terry and me will be back together on the other side so why wait any longer
carter bares down on the wheel hits the gas
the muscle car roars past a stop sign
the interior bounces as the car clears a dip past the intersection
alex clear and billy tenses
knock it off
may as well go out under my own free will right
not with us in the fuckin car
the car guns it through another stop sign
every passenger hangs on as the car bounces from the next dip
hey cmon man
whats your fuckin worry
if its not your time
i could get nailed runnin this red light and you all wouldnt get shit
only me right
knock it off
a car approaches with the greenlighted right of way
carters car tears into frame just missing being t boned in the intersection as the other car hits the brakes fishtailing
and i fuckin hated french class
carter stop it you get control of yourself
thats what im doin
i know what youre doing
its alright to be scared carter
you dont have to prove to us how big your balls are
im not afraid
i decide when its time
i control my life
i control my death
carter barrels through the intersection as a car makes a left turn at the intersection
flying down the road appears to be heading straight towards him
carter takes his hands off the wheel and raises them in the air like a terrorized child on a roller coaster
the turning car honks roaring through the intersection as carters car nearly clips the rear end of the turning car
cater hooks his elbow on the window and his right arm around the front seat driving no hands
stop the car
let us out
so close to puking you dont wanna know
were afraid too carter but were not going to quit
maybe you are
you act like youre not but you are
carter eyes clear in the rearview mirror
so stop what youre doing and stop this car
right fucking now
in the backseat alex and clear ease
just as a railroad crossing arm drops into frame in the rear window
the clang clang clang of a railroad crossing alarm
the front crossing arm drops into frame before the car
carter turns and flashes a thats why i stopped smile
carter turns off the engine then sits back into his seat and folds his arms indicating he has no intention of moving
billy get out
scared to death billy fumbles with the car door handle
from the front passenger seat he looks up and to his left
a locomotive headlight arcs across the trees
cant you open the door
easy billy just open it
billy collects himself
the train appears around the blind bend
billy opens the door and pours out
clear and alex are quickly behind him
carter remains in the drivers seat
the train warning whistle blows as alex clear and billy hustle away from the car on the same side of the tracks
they quickly turn around desperate to convince
carter get out
dont do it
dont do it
arms crossed carter remains in the front seat
as the interior fills with light from the headlight of the oncoming train carter turns and looks at them with a smart ass smile pleased that hes shown how brave
he truly is
with a beam of cocky definace
it aint my time
he cooly turns back to the ignition grabs the key and turns it over
only to be met with the dull clack of a dead engine
camera sweeps into him as his eyes flare with tension
he turns it again and again
is moments away
assess the situation
get out of the car
get out of the get out of the fuckin car
as he turns away from them carter sees something in the rearview mirror
the passing shadow is darker than any surrounding darkness
as if the image has effected him he looks to his lap belt and clacks the button
he tugs at the restraint but it will not move
hes strapped in
he tries to open the door
it wont open
he pulls at the door handle
tugs at the seatbelt
horrified he whips towards the others
i cant get out
alex billy and clear look at one another equally frightened
man he really is next
alex takes off toward
alex hustles around the drivers side
camera sweeps into them as alex desperately tries freeing the seatbelt
the whistles screams
tense as the train nears
alex grabs carter by the shoulders and strains with all his might to pull the much more muscular kid out of the drivers window
the shadowy presence is reflected by the chrome buckle however after it passes
the seat belt begins to tear
as camera sweeps in to alex and he releases a deep groan
the train tears through the front end of the muscular car
glass and metal erupt as the locomotive thunders through frame
must turn away from the shower of metal and broken glass
alex holds carter by the shirt at the shoulders dragging him away from the wreckage
the two boys collapse on the road as the trian continues to roar past
as the heavy train wheels thunder and clack a broken two foot long shard of the cars debris bounces upon the tracks kicked about by the train wheels
run to the two survivors
runs and falls into alexs arms holding him tight
carter lies on the road urine stains around his crotch hyperventilating and near tears
carter looks at the piece of seatbelt
no ones that strong
to carter bullshit
he saved your life
continue to kick around the chunk of twisted metal
the thundering train intensifies the situation
billy begins backing away from the others
billy continues backing away horrified
the debris rattles beneath the wheels
still on the ground
the debris bounces directly on the track
with great power and force a train wheel runs over the debris cutting it in half
it catches in the wheel and is spun around until shot out with the force of a missile
the metal tears across frame ripping billys head from his shoulders
the roar of the train seems exaggerated as they are frozen in horrified shock
the train clears frame and is gone
revealing across the tracks alex clear and carter can do nothing but watch billys decapitated body macabrely wobbling on its two front feet before falling to the ground
jesus fucking christ
for a beat there is silence
until in the distance sirens can be heard approaching
as alex stands and carter manages to rise on wobbly legs
none of them can remove their eyes from billys body
to carter you should have been next
after lewton you shouldve been next
thats the only pattern
you should be dead
youre the fuckin devil
to clear but i saved him
just like the plane
thats the design
police are coming
thats why it skipped carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion billy
alex looks at clear as if expiriencing an intense epiphany
my intervention in the death of surviviors will cheat the design
what are you god now
of course not
gods arent afraid to die
gods dont die
youre losin it
the police will be here
we have to go to the cabin
you can hide there
get your head together
alex considers mind racing
and then you
clear grabs clear and touches her face
to clear hey i wont let it happen okay
carter turns to them its as far as he will go to admit he believes
or will help
then get out of here
as she moves to alex clear nods her acknowledgement and appreciation to carter
she takes alex by the hand and the pair begin running away off into the woods
in the distance a train whistle blows eerie as if death was punctuating the moment
the windows are boarded
the front steps are worn and dilapidated
in the early evening moonlight the dwelling appears eerie and ghostly
camera creeps toward the house a pre storm breeze swaying branches and blowing leaves
in the distance
a final piece of duct tape is applied to the corner of the table dulling any sharp edges
even though it is sunny outside all the shades are pulled
the room sits in dark shadows broken by occasional bright shafts of light
camera follows a hand as it carefully picks up a coleman lantern and sets it atop an empty can placed in the center and above the water line of a
large metal tub a fire protection moat
finds his way to a chair in the center of the room away from everything except a nearby table holding a fire extinguisher and a first aid kit both at
less than arms reach
unshaven a week and a halfs growth and unkept alex looks horrible
an anxious zombie especially in the dim glow of the lantern
dark circles from lack of sleep
thin from lack of food
pale from lack of sunlight
he places workmans gloves on his hands before picking up a can of underwood chicken spread
with some degree of difficulty he works the gloves beneath the tab and pulls
careful not to cut himself he reaches out and drops the lid into a small trash can
alex removes the gloves and with a plastic spoon begins to eat
camera pushes in as he begins to chew methodically chewing and chewing and chewing with concentration until
after steadying himself
prepares to swallow
then carefully does
he takes the spoon
scoops some more
and the process begins again
a pink circle fills the entire frame
look downward anxious and full of thought
the results are positive two pink dots confirming
clear sighs frightened as she tosses the test upon a half dozen other discarded tests
you can never be too sure
outside wind of an approaching storm blows
camera tensely inches in on clear
the resulting thunder rumbles
a breeze blows beneath the door carrying some autumn leaves
camera follows the breeze across the floor to alexs pant legs which slightly flutter
camera rises to alex sitting in his safe chair
paranoid and obsessively cautious his eyes move towards the door anticipating the consequential events
following the path of the breeze alex turns around
the brown shopping bag tips over
amongst the trash spread on the floor a can rolls out and across the floor
he doesnt look to where the can has been but where it is going
rolls across the floor and gently hits the end of a fishing pole propped in the corner
the pole teeters and falls over
falls hooking a closet door
the door begins to swing open
is quickly out of his safe chair hustling towards
alex slams the door shut before it can open
behind the door a crash as something falls
alex cracks a wicked half smile cocky he has caught death before this attempt has brought to fruition
alex removes the hook from the door and places the pole on the floor
he cautiously opens the door revealing an old fish scaling knife embedded on the back side of the door unaware
removing the knife and securing it his eyes turn towards the floor
a tackle box has spilled thick rusted old treble and aberdeen fishing hooks upon the floor
alex bends down and examines them
as if to death rusted
defiant i overlooked it
you tried to capitalize
but i caught you you fuck
i can beat you
not forever but i got this cabin rigged to beat you now
like a thump near the cabin steps
he freezes like an animal sensing danger
the light around him begins to flicker and sway
a draft creeps beneath the glass enclosure
the flame dancing
entering frame clear peeks out the window careful not to be seen
the unmarked f
sedan maintains surveillance
schreck and weine sit inside
approaching thunder rumbles as she steps away
the weight of the world on her shoulders clear paces considering her options
she looks to a bookshelf
a man early thirties holds a six year old girl in his arms waving at the camera
both appear happy and alive
they are standing before the cabin surrounded by the thick woods
the photograph is turned over
on the back is marked in a young girls handwriting me and dad at the cabin
as camera pushes into her
then now and what is to come
weine sits in the passenger seat looking through the pair of binoculars
schreck is behind the wheel
she was up there a minute ago
a figure steps into the drivers side window from the rear
the two agents are startled as clear rivers leans into frame
she pauses gauging their trustworthiness then
im not turning him in
theres another life that needs him now
the two agents remain respectful
i go with you
dont hurt him
tell us where he is
wait at home and i promise
well bring him back safe in protective custody
as she senses the agents sincerity
distant thunder echoes
alex kindles a fire in the fireplace balling up old newspapers
he begins to crumble the local news
a headline catches his attention
camera inches in on him tense while thunder rumbles
as he unrolls the paper his expression is rocked
he cocks his head to consider
as camera pushes all the way into
parents to establish memorial scholarships
besides the headline are two yearbook photos christa marsh and blake dreyer
his expression reflects a terrifying revelation
christa asked me to move but i didnt change seats
i wouldve moved up
next to tod
how could i not remember
i never moved
clears seat was in front of mine
camera pushes into a tight close up
clear paces in her living room
she moves to the curtains and checks out the window
although it is not raining lightning cracks across the sky
the lightning strikes the top of the pole snapping two power lines which whip in the wind
the power goes out
the room turns dark
outside brilliant bluish white arc lights crackle
clear moves to the window
arc violently striking the ground and each other
each line whips unpredictably like an uncontrolled garden hose with the water turned on full
and yet theres a mean angry and taunting personality to the two power lines
as if death were within them
she assesses the situation and moves to a pair of candles on the mantle lightning them with a bic
from the backyard a dog barks
clear brings the candle through the small house
clear moves quickly to the kitchen holding the candle
outside blue arc light crackles
she looks out the backyard
an old circular clothesline turns like a pinwheel in the wind
in the center of the yard is an oblong tarped above ground pool
in the furthest corner of the yard her dog is chained to a tree barking and freaked out
an old tire swing rocks in the storm
from the manner in which the house is situated and the length of the snapped power lines one is capable of reaching the backyard
the power line strikes the ground closing in on the dog
clear considers the danger of venturing out to get the dog
although no window is open and the power outage has shut off any air conditioning
the candle flame whips then extinguishes
the blue smoke swirls ominously into the room
sharp metal edges spin
glinting blue arc light
alex charges out the front door leaping over the steps
several cars approach headlights pan across the trees
alex stops dead in his tracks and runs off into the woods just as the f
i umarked sedan and three sheriff x s thunder up to the cabin siren lights swirling
weine is driving leading the other vehicles
schreck points out the passenger window
full sprint alex disappears into the dark forest
the cars brake to a stop skidding in the dirt
sheriffs leap out of their vehicles
high powered flashlights shoot beams in alexs direction
the officers take after the suspect
the backdoor opens
clear charges out into the backyard
helpless chain wrapped around the tree
continues to run
is whipped by a power line
sparks fly as the base pole snaps in two
the metal poles punge into the ground just before and behind her inches from impaling her
she stumbles but quickly steps aside and continues toward the tree
is rolled by the winds across the yard toward
the clothesline frame punctures the pool
water streams from the rupture
reaches the tree and begins unfastening the dogs collar from the chain
whipping strike one another causing an angry flash
holding the pool frame begin to break and pop
water floods into the yard
camera moves with alex blindly running through the forest sheriffs flashlight beams crossing behind him
looing back to check the postition of the agents alex blindly runs over the lip of a downward slope
he rolls and tumbles uncontrollably down the hillside
as he nears the base
stops with a crunching thud
his face an inch from being impaled by a sharp thick protruding branch
no time to catch his breath hes up and running
water floods pooling the backyard cascading over clears feet
she looks down in the reflection of the puddle the dark shadow passes
clear whips up checking the position of
coils like a cobra ready to strike
clear drops the chain and hits the dog on its backside
the dog starts to tear off toward the house
clear runs toward the hanging tire
whips the frayed wires hitting the puddle of water
in mid air desperately grabs the tire hanging on literally for her life
the dog yelps
clear turns back
convulses in the small pool of water burning from the overwhelming amounts of electricity
distant flashlights reflect in a small stream barely two inches deep
alexs foot splashes in the water
races along the path of the stream
continue their pursuit through the dark trees
lightning cracks a tree branch
the tree tumbles down the branches
the thick branch falls from above landing on top of him
hes knocked to the ground and pinned
face down in the creek
camera moves in
his nose and mouth just below the water line but he cannot move
his eyes flash with panic as he struggles
battles to move and avoid drowning in two inches of water
as he struggles in the f
weine and a pair of sheriffs appear ten yards beyond him
they pause confused panning their flashlights across the forest
the lights actually expose the area where alex lies
from their postition however he is covered by the branch and out of sight
struggles to raise his head above the water chest bursting
believing alex is not in the area move ahead into the woods
clear pulls herself up to a tree branch
lighting and thunder continue amongst the arcing crackling power lines
she searches for an escape
extends toward the house
straining in the storm begins moving up the branch
taking a tenth of a second to gather all of his strength all his courage he arches his back pushing with his hands anything to lift his face out of
with a deep gasp he does so
drinking up the air
it appears to infuse him with another blast of adrenaline as he manages to push with his arms and free himself from the pinning tree branch
he pauses only for a couple gulps of air
and is off
clear leaps from the end of the branch to her window grabbing the sill awkwardly she dangles outside the house
with a breath she pulls herself inside just as the power line bites arcing at her feet
weine runs into frame looks around frustrated
into radio lost him
deperately scans the area
from the direction
theres only one place he can heading
the power lines strike the rooftop
clear rivers stands in her bedroom just as it fills with blinding blue light
her television screen blows out
sparks jet across the room
blasts of flame erupt from the electrical outlets
she quickly turns racing toward the hallway
camera is low racing with her as sparks explode from the lamps and electrical outlets
she cuts and leaps three steps at a time down the staircase
alex tears across the fenceless backyards towards clears house
blue arc light glowing from the front yard
a mid eighties corolla is parked amongst clears artwork
a door adjacent to the kitchen flies open
clear hustles through running to the car and entering via the passenger door for the sake of expediency
the power lines whack angerily against the door
clear scoots into the drivers seat
she clicks the automatic garage door opener
connected to a metal arm attached to the door remains motionless there is no power
realizing the motor is dead clear takes a beat starts the engine and shifts into reverse
alex reaches the backyard
camera pushes in as he quickly tries to deduce the deadly situation
he runs out of frame
clear guns the small car in reverse
as the rear of the car makes impact with the door
trembles the long metal arm collapses falls
in reverse the corolla smashes through the garage door
of the garage door opener rips through the windshield locking upon the windshield wiper grille
the other end remains attached to the garage roof interior essentially acting as an anchor
the car shudders wheels spinning uselessly as the arm holds onto the car
the screws holding the arm to the ceiling begin to pull away
on a shelf is rocked as o
the car rattles the garage trying to break free
the can is marked turpentine extremely flammable
the can tumbles over the shelf
the can smacks on the floor edgewise revrealing the can is sealed tight with a cap
thick cable arcs snapping toward the car into frame
foot to the floor clear screams for the car to move
pulls away from the ceiling
the corolla lurches backward freed from the grasp of the house
a chunk of the ceiling collapses upon clears artworks including the canvas incorporating a jagged piece of debris from flight
the metal slams to the floor on top of
which causes the flammable liquid to stream out toward the driveway
as the corolla lurches away from the house down the sloped driveway
thuds upon clears car
an ear splitting crackle
the electrical system of the samll car erupts and the engine dies
the car stops
from the rear of the house appears alex
camera sweeps in on him as he reacts to the situation
the power line sadistically rests atop the automobile
the exposed end of the cable flutters and whips like a cats tail sparking crackling as it hits the ground
clear looks up desperately to alex
alex extends his hands
cars approach thunderoulsy
youre grounded in the car
dont touch anything
the unmarked f
vehicle and two sheriff patrol cars pull up on the street
schreck and weine hustle out of the car
alex get away from there
any part of that line touches you youre dead
snaps in alexs direction
is ignited by a single spark fom the power line
it flows toward the car
backs away eyes locked with clears assuring shes remaining in the car
keeps her eyes locked on alex watching him
suddenly a burst of fire flashes from below frame
the underbelly of the corolla has ignited from the stream of combustible fluid
atop the car whips arcs warning everyone away
clear can see the flames her instinct is to grab the handle to get out
the fire roars angrily in the f
on the garage wall however the shadows do not match that of the flames rather the approaching form of death appears
camera pushes in on alex as he quickly considers then moves toward the hood of the burning car
youll both die
hearing this alexs mind is made up
he looks to clear
you know what to do
when i do this
itll have skipped you
and itll all be over
at that moment clear doesnt understand
she looks to him scared
you know what to do
ill always be with you
he reaches out and grabs the power line falling back to pull it away from the hood of the car
the cable arcs furiously
clear opens the drivers side door and runs out knocked to her feet as behind her the car explodes
is engulfed in the flames
the edges of the frame are collapsing
alexs face gray and emotionless appears yet before it can transform into decay
through the flames as if sensing the oncoming horror defying the image
he looks toward
is the last sight hell ever see
the power line erupts
alex disapears behind the wall of fire and sparks before falling limp on the driveway
schreck weine and paramedics rush to the girl
schreck turns back calling out to a paramedic helplessly watching by ther burning car
is he alive
flash open horrified answering the question
a web of lightning cracks across the heavens as if death was making a final angry proclamation
camera eases in on the agents exchanging rattled expressions that convey their unease in the proof that alex was right
as a pair of paramedics work on her a soft breeze blows across the girl and only the girl
camera moves down to her face her eyes opened
welling with tears
seeming to realize
to sense he is gone
screams as if reacting to alexs death but in actuality it is a reaction to the pain of delivering her child
stand between clears legs in the stirrups
a little more
breathes pushes hard
alexs parents stand on each side of her holding her hand wiping her forehead
cuts the umbilical cord
a beautiful boy
smile and fight back the tears
clear begins to laugh euphorically through the tears
i felt him
when the baby was born
i felt alex pass through me
like the night he died
clear lifts her head up still battling the pain of labor
covered in goop eyes shut
a new life arrives
looks at the clock and reprots to an attending nurse
another nurse cleans up the baby wieghs him and places him in a hospital bassinet
th of may
barabra places a cool wet cloth on clears forehead
exactly a year
to the minute
everyone recognizes the eerie yet beautiful coincidence
clear leans her haed back relieved euphoric
we beat it alex
cleaned and wrapped in a swaddling blanket the baby is placed in the mothers arms
the long retrospective harmonica of neil youngs long may you run reprises as clear looks at the i
alexander chance browning ii
camera pulls back
the birthing room is quiet the people introspective
the mother and child
a room of new life in which each recalls a life lost
as long may you run overlaps
a bright colorful arrangment of flowers is carefully placed into a vase
camera adjusts to reveal alexs bedroom is now lived in by clear and the baby
clear makes the final adjustment in the arrangement then checks the sleeping baby in the bassinet
clear moves to her bed with a book
as she settles in o
a faint rustle
camera inches in on clear as she looks to
a soft breeze causes the petals to flutter
which are closed
looks across the room
the breeze moves through the flowers
billows the cutains posters and photos on the wall
until seemingly settling over the bassinet
the lace trim and blankets rustled by the breeze it is hovering over the child
camera settles but her expression does not reflect fear
she knows alex is here
and she smiles tears welling in her eyes
the bassinet trim settles as if the presence is leaving
before it fully departs
the wind softly and rapidly passes over clear
he smile remains as the room becomes still and her eyes looks across the room
is a pencil rubbing like people take away from the vietnam veterans memorial
alex browning is marked in the granite
camera pulls back to reveal the name has been added to the memorial along with tod waggner valerie lewton terry chaney and william hitchcock
a hand enters frame fingers hover in space before they gently trace over terry chaney
camera adjusts to reveal carter horton staring at the name
alone he allows himself the moment to grieve
carter glances up to find clear approaching with the baby in the stroller
carter straightens and nods then begins to walk away
he hesitates then turns back to clear
alex was right
clear looks up
it did skip us
as she takes the baby out of the stroller
thats what alex believed
but how do we know
this wasnt the design all along
clear holds baby alex up to the monument showing her son his fathers name
carter stands watching
camera widens to reveal the entire monument against the deep blue sky
at the base in readable but understandable lettering
camera holds as long may you run continues
returning each of us to the awaiting darkness
