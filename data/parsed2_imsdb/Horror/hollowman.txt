the hollow man written by andrew w
marlowe red wagon prods
revised draft on complete darkness
a small door swings open
a circle of light reveals that we i re looking down the length of a tube
at the far end of the tube we see a gloved hand dangling a rat
the hand shoves the frightened rat into the tube and closes the door behind it
the rat s stark white fur bristles and it begins to pad down the tube s length
after several feet the tube opens up into a dimly lit cubicle
the rat hesitates and stops
the sounds of gentle breathing whispers in the rat s ears
the rat turns round to head back down the tube but a door swings shut trapping it in the cubicle
the rat cowers as the breathing turns to snorting
the rat s head jerks around looking for signs of danger but the cubicle is empty
the rat sees a water dish on the far side of the cubicle a place to hide and dashes toward it
but an invisible force descends
the rat squeals in agony as something smashes down on its body crushing it
a loud bellow rings out and the rat flies into the air halting a few feet off the ground
its body writhes struggling against the unholy force
then a sick crunch of tiny bones snapping
all life quickly drains from the levitating body
the creature s corpse floats in mid air
then the white fur of the rat explodes in a shower of blood
huge blood smeared incisors appear as do the red slicked ape like lips
the gaping bloody mouth bites again into the rat
in the background we hear jay leno s monologue from the tonight show
a small lamp and the glow from a computer screen illuminates sebastian caine late twenties with the shabby good looks of a perpetual grad student
wiry framed and wearing only boxer shorts sebastian sips coffee from an einstein coffee mug
he peers at a complex computer rendered molecule displayed on his screen
he pecks a few keys and the molecule shifts slightly then falls apart
sebastian pulls a twinkie from a hostess box unwraps the cellophane and sucks it down
he attacks the keyboard with renewed vigor
another molecule appears on the screen
sebastian s fingers fly across the keyboard
the molecule blinks on and off it trembles and twists apart
sebastian pears out his window
across the courtyard a light comes on in a neighboring window
he sees a brunette mid twenties absolutely stunning enter her living room
the brunette thumbs through the mail tosses it and then begins to undress
sebastian loans over to the window getting interested
but when the brunette reaches her bra and panties she crosses to the window and lowers her shades
sebastian cont d damnit
sebastian leans back in his chair and closes his eyes
he s obviously tired
he opens his eyes and stares up at the ceiling
painted across the white matte finish in big red letters is a brief reminder you should be working
sebastian sighs leans forward and begins pecking away again
the television is now only static
we pan by his alarm clock
we find sebastian pacing in front of his computer
he gets an idea
slides back in his chair
types away again
the molecule reforms on the computer screen
he types a few more keys waits watches the molecule
he hits a few more keys and watches intently for a reaction
beat i am a goddamn genius
he hits a few more keys and a telephone keypad appears on the screen
digital phone rings
in the bed linda foster late twenties stirs from a deep sleep
as she straggles out of bed and over to her desk we notice a young man sleeping next to her
the ringing continues
she moves her computer mouse around and her screen comes to life
she click on a telephone icon and the ringing stops
a beat later sebastian appears in a window on her screen
sebastian do you know what time it is
you know da vinci never slept
said it was waste of time
what is it this time
sebastian peers at the image of linda in the computer window
he notices something behind her in the bed the young man sleeping face down
who s that
linda pulls the camera off the top of the of the computer screen and positions it so sebastian can t see the bed
not your business
so you calling about anything in particular or were you just hoping to catch me sleeping in the nude
i cracked the reversion
upon hearing this linda receives a jolt of adrenaline
you cracked it
look at this
sebastian hits a couple of keys
a moment later the molecular structure appears on linda s computer
astonished eleven months with no progress and you suddenly come up with it out of the blue
coffee and twinkies
i hate you
you think you could hunt down matt and get to the lab early
i want isabelle prepped for a live test
yeah i think i can find him
what are you going to do
well y know
it s daylight in switzerland
i gotta call the nobel committee and tell them to get our prizes ready
see you in a few
on linda s computer screen as sebastian clicks off
linda crosses to her bed and shakes the guy awake
matthew kensington late s too stirs from under sheets
sebastian just called
we gotta get to the lab
matt bolts up
you didn t tell him i was here did you
give me some credit will ya
so what s the rush
he cracked reversion
matt pulls his jeans on
wanna ride down
we better take our own cars
you re gonna have to tell him about us eventually
it s just you re his best friend
he ll feel betrayed
from a distance the nation s monuments stand awash in the harsh light of morning
camera finds a black porsche as it pulls to the security fence of a warehouse
the imposing structure is surrounded by a chainlink fence and barbed wire
the porsche is waved through security and heads straight into the warehouse
the porsche pulls to a halt in a reserved parking space and sebastian exits wearing a hawaiian shirt shorts and birkenstocks
he notes the other cars parked in the lot then crosses to bunker in the center of the warehouse guarded by a marine shouldering an m
your team s in early
something special going on
you know the rules
sebastian presses his thumb against a glass screen
a laser reads his print
scan readout caine sebastian clearance alpha alpha three division classified the doors whisk open and sebastian steps inside
have a good day sir
inside the elevator is a numberless keypad
sebastian taps in his floor code
caine zero zero two seven
good morning dr
the elevator descends with a groaning hum
it passes below us and keeps descending into the belly of the earth the shaft goes down forever
we slowly push down a hallway panelled by plexiglas chambers
each chamber looks as if it s tailored for a specific animal although no animals are visible
as we pass one habitat something slams into the plexiglas and begins barking
another howl joins in
suddenly the hallway fills with a dozen animal cries
the plexiglas on several chambers vibrates as if angry animals were slamming against it
but still no animals are seen
above each chamber video screens display thermal images revealing heat signatures of the various animals but they remain invisible to the naked eye
matt taps on a sheet of plexiglas which seals off another seemingly empty cage
the woodchips on the floor shift and suddenly the plexiglas steams up right in front of matt s face
the plexiglas begins to shake violently
matt cont d calm down baby
it s okay
matt takes a pair of thermal goggles from his belt and pulls them down over his eyes
thermal pov a rather large heat signature ape like in shape rattles about the cage
matt slowly unlatches the plexiglas door and reaches inside
matt cont d it s okay baby
it s okay
i m not going to hurt you
thermal pov he reaches out to the creature
he grabs hold of it firmly
the creature coos
matt reaches for a hypo and brings it up to the creature
matt cont d just hold still
something clamps down on his hand breaking his skin
blood erupts in a bite pattern
matt cont d ow shit
matt drops the hypo and falls back
the cage door flies open and something runs out
matt pulls himself up to see the heat signature running down the hallway
he turns around to see another heat signature coming at him
matt pulls off his goggles to see linda coming up the corridor
she bit me
she s become a lot more aggressive in the last few days
linda takes the goggles from matt
linda cont d go take care of that bite
i ll get her
and give you a chance to pull ahead
linda opens a lock box at the end of the hallway and pulls out a two tranquilizer guns
she hands one to matt
a slight distortion shimmers as something runs past us
we hear hoots and footsteps
looking down the shadowy corridor we hear grunting and a haunting heavy breathing
the control door is closed though and something large and angry is throwing itself against it
we can t see anything
a few moments later linda and matt round the corner wearing goggles and leveling their pistols
ala porky shh
be vewy vewy quiet
i m hunting simians
knock it off
soothing voice isabelle
thermal pov dark hallway
a red shimmering heat signature
it comes running at linda
a t dart flies
it stops in mid air
but it doesn t hit the floor
instead it stops inches above the ground
thermal pov the heat signature lies in a heap at linda s feet
good shootin tex
what s that make it
i m still ahead
like a smug gunfighter linda blows imaginary smoke from the top of her tranquilizer gun
but i m catching up
the elevator doors open and sebastian steps out
he s met by sarah kennedy early thirties a fiery red head
can i have a word
most normal people say good morning
don t you think you should test the protocol on the liver samples before you inject isabelle
how many tissue samples have we successfully regressed
how many have gone on to work on the full system
that s beside the point
no that is the point
i m not going to waste six months of my life on an outmoded testing procedure
this thing works
i know it
i feel it
linda comes down the corridor listening in on the tail end of the conversation
you can mop up afterward
you think i m going to kill isabelle
more like liquefy
sarah thank you for your opinion but i m the project leader
but somehow it feels like fuck you
she storms off
sebastian turns to linda
how did you ever convince me to hire her
you said you wanted the beat vet in the country
yeah well she cares more about the animals than the research
maybe that s why she s so good
close on matt as he shuts off the spinning cyclotron
as it s spinning slows to a halt he pops the top and reaches in removing
sebastian peers at the vial
who da man
you da man
as we pull out we see we are
almost feels like a dungeon
think high tech frankenstein
walls lined with video displays technical readouts bizarre medical equipment
on a table in the middle of the room a sheet drapes over a humanoid form strapped down at it s invisible limbs
the straps move slightly
wires lead from the body to lots of machinery
protocol is hot
sarah checks over the various readouts
heartbeat blood pressure the rest
carter abbey the late thirties lab assistant wheels in a cart of equipment
linda taken a seat by the table and pushes aside the sheet
how many times do i have to tell you frank you aren t god
beat i am
sebastian glance up at a glass booth overlooking the laboratory floor
two people in the booth
you guys ready to roll
frank chase early thirties and tech expert janice walton early twenties man a small booth above the lab
they re dressed more like band roadies than scientists
the room is crammed with electronic and recording equipment
a handful of monitors display different images of the lab
thermal and regular video
another screen monitors vital signs
we are live and in color
on your mark
frank and janice looks down on their colleagues
sebastian nods their way
we are rolling record on videos one through twelve
frank hits a series of buttons and speaks into a microphone
frank s voice echoes through the chamber
subject isabelle two
currently in phase shift
one hundred twenty six days eighteen hours
testing de phase protocol
injecting serial protein caine one two five
linda removes a glowing vial of orange liquid from a centrifuge nearby
maybe if you stopped naming them after yourself you d have better luck
why thank you dr
kensington for that keen scientific observation
i ll be sure to include it in my memoirs
a whole mention
and i thought i was just gonna be a footnote
matt unwraps a hypodermic needle and jabs the needle into the vial drawing up the colored liquid
frank and janice monitor isabelle s vitals
tension in the air
to linda ready
she wraps a bungee cord around nothing and pulls it tight
she then takes some dye and sprays it
a surface appears floating beneath the restraints
it sheens in the light as linda searches for a vein
she slaps the surface several times
a small bulge appears like a vein
let s make some history
matt lowers the hypo to the vein
but sebastian takes the hypo from matt s hand
nice try sparky
matt relinquishes the needle
come on isabelle
you can do this
sebastian lowers the hypo
the skin bonds and gives
the needle remains in sight after it slips through the visible surface
matt presses down on the hypo plunger releasing a dye into his bloodstream
the gold liquid twists into a long snaking tube up and down the limb
it s the shape of a vein
the liquid begins to react
small flashes of light blip up and down the strand of color
the heartbeat starts to speed up
janice analyzes the screens
we re still in the green
vitals still in the normal range
the glowing liquid turns from gold to red as the complex webbing of a bloodstream appears
it s reacting
spreading out from the bloodstream soon becomes visible
the shadow of a skeletal system
do you see this
it s working
it s actually working
matt pulls the sheet back
muscles are beginning to appear
heart rate s up
she s scared
sarah soothes her
sarah cont d its okay baby
subject began manifesting almost immediately
protocol is reacting quickly
isabelle starts to struggle against her restraints
she begins to howl
subject may be in pain or extreme discomfort
blood pressure elevating
brain activity going through the roof
the brain appears seemingly growing from the inside out
the shape of a large half formed monkey grows from the inside out
a skull appears howling in pain in horror
sarah cont d we ve got a problem
sarah checks her monitors
it s her heart
we can see the heart beating in the ape s i got an erratic heart beat
she s going into cardiac arrest
got the crash cart
carter charges the crash cart and rolls it in
we re losing her
her machine flatlines
it s got to work
the body is only half there
it looks as if its caught in decomposition
linda rubs the cardiac paddles together
linda slams the paddles on the monkey s chest
the jolt of electricity makes the monkey visible again for a brief moment
then the skin and flesh fade away again
we ve got something
the heartbeat starts up again
the body continues its march toward visibility
sarah cont d still
come on isabelle
you can do it
you can fucking do it
everybody s pulling for her
come on monkey
muscles spread like a rash on bone as the monkey twists and turns frightened
the monkey howls
skin forms over the muscles reappearing like it was being painted on before our eyes
the entire form glows then blinks then glows again as if it was discharging some stored energy
brain activity returning to normal
the monkey grunts and groans
blinks its eyes
linda hovers over it stroking its fur
welcome back isabelle
sebastian puts his hand on linda s shoulder
a move that does not go unnoticed by matt
we did it
beat how is she
surprised i think she s gonna be okay frank matt sarah janice and linda watch isabelle rise and walk about the cage
she goes over to the other monkeys and joins in their grooming rituals
shes normal absolutely healthy
if you didnt know any better youd think nothing had happened to her
ribbing sarah yeah
i cant wait to slice up her brain and trace her neural pathways
screw you matt
well maybe not right away
we should celebrate
the fanciest one in d
the entire eight person team sits around a round table drunk and laughing as the last champagne flute is filled
sebastian raises his glass
to the finest research team ive ever known
a round of hear hears and they all clink glasses and drink
the din of the diners fades away as linda slips out onto the restaurants balcony
she find sebastian leaning against a railing breathing in the night air
i thought youd gone
where would i go
he looks out over the sweep of the city the twinkling lights of d
and darkness of the potomac river
sebastian contd twenty years ago there were no computers no fax machines no cell phones
i was just wondering what the world will be like twenty years from now
if what were doing will change everything
a little i am become death
the shatterer of worlds
something like that
since the day i met all you wanted to do was change the world
she puts her hand on his shoulder
linda contd listen i know weve
well i just want you to know how proud i am of you
i know it probably doesnt mean a lot
actually it does
beat i guess since you were there from the beginning you know me better than anyone else on this godforsaken planet
youre positively maudlin
you should be happy
do you have any idea what youve accomplished
but i was working so hard i didnt realize id have no one to share it with
sebastian heads back inside
but he stops and turns back
sebastian contd i dont suppose we could turn back the clock for a night and you could come home with me
her look says it all
too much water under the bridge
sebastian contd right
too much champagne
he turns and heads back into the party
as he heads in he passes matt heading out
he and sebastian exchange heys
what was that about
he is who he is
sometimes i just have to be reminded
sebastian wanders through the empty hallways of the laboratory
sebastian paces back and forth examining the habitats
he taps on the plexiglas of one
the cubicle explodes with we see the plexi steam up in one part as if something was breathing on it
as if a nose were pressed against it
a little drunk whats it like
tell me what its like
flying over washington d
we cross the potomac and circle the five cornered building looking particularly gloomy on this grey day
six years ago this committee commissioned me with a very specific task
at the table are six men
a handful of senior military brass and top civilian advisors direct their attention to the front of the room where sebastian flanked by matt and linda is in the middle
of his presentation
to successful phase shift a human being out of quantum sync with the visible universe and then return him safely with no after affects
next to sebastian a video shows a small monkey shifting from the visible spectrum
its hair skin organs and skeletons slowly dissolve before our eyes
sebastian contd well we found out sending them to never never land was easy its the getting back thats hard
sebastian fast forwards a few moments until the video screen shows the bizarrely tangled heap of flesh and bone that used to be alive
sebastian contd every time weve tried to bring a test subject back from phase shift
cellular bonds would dissolve the primary dna strands would decay
somethings bothering him
sebastian contd but now
one of the senior advisers dr
harry kramer distinguished s finally breaks the silence
linda and matt look up at sebastian expectantly
pause but now we feel we are closer than ever to resolving this issue
weve been experimenting with a new regression formula that looks rather promising
a four star general leans forward
son as you can imagine we are very anxious to field test this tactical asset
how long till you resolve this issue
linda starts to speak but sebastian cuts her off with a look
shouldnt be more than another year sir
frustrated sighs all around the room
sebastian contd maybe sooner
as linda matt and sebastian head to their cars
what the hell was that about
keep your voice down
the protocol works
whyd you tell them it didnt
i wasnt ready for them to know
but theyre the oversight committee
theyre supposed to know
im sure he had a reason
firmly you did have a reason didnt you sebastian
i had more than a reason
i had a goddamn epiphany
they reach his porsche
sebastian contd what do you think theyd do if they know we could send a subject into phase shift and pull it back out again
how many seconds would it take for them to take over the whole project bringing in their soldiers to test the formula on
wed have lost control of it by the end of the week
its their money sebastian
its going to happen eventually
but not yet
theres too much for us to learn
i dont want my hands tied by their political agenda when we go to phase three
mind telling us how youre gonna get a human test subject for phase three without the committee finding out
ive decided to test the procedure
the team sits around the conference table
their jaws drop and they stare at him with wide eyes
are you nuts
was jonas salk nuts
pretty sure he was
and remember for every jonas salk there are a bunch of guys who arent famous cuz they died
if were that unsure how can we morally justify testing it on someone else
isnt it a little soon to be moving into phase three anyway
we havent even finished collating the phase two research
well have plenty of time to collate and cross reference later
monkey data doesnt matter anyway
the only real data is human data
you dont even know if any of the protocols will work on humans
how are we gonna find out
besides weve succeeded with a gorilla and their dna is the same as humans
and the is not that significant
humans can talk build houses and cook in microwave ovens
gorillas live in trees
thats a helluva if you ask me
were all concerned
i know that
but if were gonna move forward ever this is something we have to do
why not one of us
i couldnt ask
interrupting what if we volunteer
what if youre too valuable to lose
im project leader
its my formula and my call
the best way to express your concern is to make damn sure you do your best work
ill want about four weeks to
to put your affairs in order
to run some more reversions and tissue tests and then well attempt the phase shift
ill stay shifted for three days of testing and then well perform a quantum regression
a knock on the door
linda pushes into the room and closes the door behind her
sebastian contd what
in the past six years ive never once challenged your decisions but this sebastian
i dont think you should do this
you dont understand
how long were we together
you mustve said it a million times nobody knows who built the lunar lander
all they remember in the first man on the moon
sebastian shrugs and nods
linda contd but what if something happens to you
what about the project
lin trust me
nothings going to happen
linda and matt are in bed together
matt kisses her way up and down her arm
but linda is distracted
he refuses to listen to reason
can we talk about this later
im trying to make love to you
i just cant let it go
matt props himself up on the pillow
i know how youre feeling
hell he and ive been friends since freshman year
so how can we let him do this
what if you were given the opportunity to be the first person on mars would you go
in a heartbeat
what if they didnt know whether or not they could get you home
linda thinks about it
its still tempting
matt contd this is his chance to be chuck yeager or christopher columbus
well if i were him id do the same thing
matt goes back to kissing linda
let me ask another question
is about who gets to be on top
is the human race really ready for what were doing
matt groans and rolls over
why do you always get philosophical before were about to get physical
is it ready
were barrelling down a road that begs moral and ethical questions that i dont think we can answer
they said the same thing about the bomb
they said wed never survive the nuclear age
but here we are
this night is still young
beat i mean when you think about it its creepy
do we really want to live in a world where people can just disappear in the blink of an eye
we made our deal with the devil years ago
might as well stick around to cash in
sebastian stripped to his shorts paces nervously
a knock on the door
his voice catches yes
matt sticks his head in
sebastian nervously shakes his limbs out
its not too late to back out
im happy to take your place
matt leads him into the hallway
as they walk down the corridor toward the lab
ever tell you the one about superman and wonder woman
i dont think so
so supermans flying around the city and hes horny as hell
lo and behold he looks down and sees wonder woman completely nude sunning herself up on the roof of the justice league
i mean she is lying there naked and spread eagle
so superman starts thinking man
this is too easy
i could go down there do a little fast pumping and be gone before she even sees me
after all he is faster than a speeding bullet right
anyway he swoops down takes care of business so quick you cant even see him
i tell ya
wonder woman looks up surprised as hell and says what the hell was that
and the invisible man replies i dunno know but it sure hurt like hell
sebastian shoots matt a look
you know that could be the last joke i ever hear
thats funny shit
the buzz of conversation is punctuated by an amplified heartbeat thumping its familiar rhythm
in the center of the room sebastian dressed only in a pair of jogging shorts is strapped to a table inclined at a degree angle
electrodes are strapped to his body
tube snakes from the needle in his vein up to a bag of saline solution
linda makes last minute checks of some of the equipment
she pats sebastian on the shoulder
howre you feeling
sebastian takes a deep breath
sarah checks his vitals
pulse bp over
a bit elevated
to be expected
no reason for concern
linda takes a moment and studies sebastians face
shes almost teary eyed
its gonna be okay
back to business
janice hits record on the equipment decks
all systems nominal houston
frank coordinates all the data being fed into the computers
he pushes a series of buttons and speaks into a microphone
lets make some history
franks voice echoes through the chamber
subject male age weight lbs
matt jabs a hypodermic into small vial of colored liquid
draws up ccs
to linda ready
linda takes the hypo from matt
matt contd if the tests are any indication it should work quickly
ill inject myself
if anything goes wrong they cant blame you
she hands the hypo sebastian and steps away
sebastian stares at the golden formula silently for a moment
we can still shut down sebastian
he shakes his head
any last words
if im killed pretend i said something deep and clever
back to business
he inserts the needle into the i
presses into himself and depresses the plunger
injection was administered at checks watch
the colored liquid snakes its way into his bloodstream
linda contd keep talking
tell us what youre feeling
nothing so far
vitals are stable
they wait and watch
another moment passes by
human dna structure is slightly more complex
its possible that it may take more time
another moment passes
maybe we overlooked something
recheck the protocol
it cant be non reactive
kinda like a firecracker with a bad fuse
sebastian shoots carter a questioning look
carter contd dont know if itll go off
from the booth no change in bio electric
another long pause
sebastian contd okay wait my arm
its getting a bit warm
its starting to tingle
excitement overtakes the room
sebastian contd okay
its spreading to my back
like like a fever
here we go
slowly the flesh on sebastians arm begins dissolving revealing the complex network of nerves blood vessels and flesh beneath it
its starting to burn
i didnt think it would hurt
the heart beat thumps faster accelerating heartbeats elevated
what do you feel
blood pressure over
hes going to blow out his heart
prop the crash cart
carter grabs the crash cart rolls it in
matt tears off the i
leads into sebastians arms
weve got to stop it
all the monitors are going crazy
frank leans into the microphone
electric activity increasing in all limbs
brainwaves are through the roof
i didnt think the human brain could spike that high
maybe it cant
sebastian screams in dire pain
he struggles against his restraints as his skin liquefies into a muscular mass
its like somethings eating away at him
the yells become louder and more painful to hear
the muscular system begins to dissolve leaving a struggling skeleton wrapped with tentacular blood vessels and stuffed with the major organs
the beating heart the heaving lungs
then the organs go
then the blood vessels
leaving only a skeleton howling in pain
the jawbones spread wide
then as if someone had poured acid all over the bones the skeleton evaporates into nothingness
pulse is dropping
there is nothing left of sebastian caine
bio quantum phase shift occurred at
the screaming continues and the restraints continue to twist and turn
suddenly the restraints go limp
is he dead
linda checks the readouts
he passed out from the trauma
vitals returning to normal
blood pressure over
a long beat as everybodys eyes stare at the instruments
electrical activity is stabilizing
pulse steady at
a long beat
un fucking believable
a reverent pause as linda runs her fingers over what would be his skin
small electrical charge dance around her fingertips
whispers in his ear you did it sebastian
youre the first
lets get him into recovery
the chamber is half constructed out of plexiglas at the end of the hallway of habitats
on the recovery bed a sheet drapes over sebastians invisible body
the gentle bleatings of medical machinery pound out a dulling rhythm
linda sleeps in a corner chair as matt slips into the room
he checks the readouts on sebastian then takes a seat by linda
she wakes with a start
you nodded off
his breathings hypnotic
how longs it been
where are the others
in the lab crunching numbers
weve got enough data there for two lifetimes of research
linda rubs her temples and gestures to the bed
i keep looking at that hole wondering if hes really there
she notices something out of the corner of his eye
the sheet twitches
linda contd did you see
the sheet twitches again
he may be coming out of it
linda and matt watch intently
the sheets thrash violently
a yell of pain
turn off the goddamn lights
linda jumps up and crosses to sebastian
matt rushes to the wall and turns off the lights
the room is lit by the glow of machinery
sebastians voice contd i cant
i cant close my eyes
i cant close my eyes
your eyelids are transparent
the sheets slowly stop thrashing
i can feel them
your whole body
it worked sebastian
the sheet rises and slips away
the wires seemingly connected to thin air spread out like a spiders web and then fall away one by one
the monitors all go dead
i want to see
over here in the corner
matt motions to a dark corner of the room toward a mirror and sink
we push in on the mirror
suddenly it fogs up
a finger tracing appears in the fog
but of course we see no finger
the sink faucet twists on and water runs
it cups into the shape of hands and lifts into the air splashing against the surface of sebastians face
beads of water cling to his f ace outlining it i shape f or a moment before dripping away
matt contd what was it like
its hard to think
sebastians voice is now behind him
matt turns around
sebastians voice contd the transformation
i remember every molecule in my body shattering
it was painful
but then everything went black
i couldnt see or hear or feel anything
it was all just black
like i wasnt connected
your system received quite a shock
at least my senses are starting to return
youre wearing your shalimar arent you
linda realizes that hes standing very close by
her hair lifts slightly and sebastian inhales
chills go down her spine
lindas hair drops back to her shoulders
this is weird
im looking through myself at the floor
im looking right through myself
i cant tell
he bumps into a chair
sebastians voice contd where my body is
a moment of silence
linda and matt look at each other slightly alarmed
an indentation forms on the bed a moment later
you really cant see me
dizziness nausea headache body ache disorientation
no just tired
beat its funny
i can see everything
more than before
but i cant see myself
carter frank janice and sarah work at various research stations
the door opens and linda and matt enter
hows he doing
why dont you ask him
linda motions to the gap between her and matt
the four of them stare at the nothing
sebastian how do you feel
not to bad considering
they turn round
the voice is coming from behind them
the group rises from their various workstations and turn toward where the voice came from
sebastians voice contd odd isnt it
a rheostat switch on the wall turns and the lights dim
though its a simple act it feels somewhat ominous
he cant close his eyes so theyre sensitive to light
lindas explanation puts everyone at ease
so what was it like
sebastian has moved
as everyone turns toward him again he cant stifle a slight giggle
knock it off
his voice again come s from somewhere else in the room
i feel like were playing marco polo
well i see the procedure hasnt changed your personality
frank pulls on a pair of thermal goggles
im on it
thermal pov every body in the laboratory shows up as a heat signature including sebastian
frank contd gotcha big man
thermal pov the heat signature reaches for a chair
boy you people have no sense of humor
a chair slides back from a desk and bends under sebastians weight
sebastians voice contd show me
frank and janice shuttle the playback controls as a video monitor re plays various angles of sebastians phase shift
frank halts the tape
sebastians voice contd index that
that was when it started burn
janice scribble the numbers in her notebook
linda crosses nursing a cup of coffee
time you got some rest
just a little longer
hate to pull rank but youre my patient now and you need rest
weve got a busy day tomorrow
as linda enters she points to a small camera in the upper corner of the room
weve set up a thermal camera for observation and ive arranged one of us to be here in case you need anything
the teams gonna be on alpha call alert for the duration
if anything goes wrong we can all be here within
yes i know
i wrote the procedure
i was trying to be reassuring
you like this dont you
being in charge
its clear she does
but shes certainly not going to admit it
im just doing my job
close on a video screen
a thermal lump lays stretched out on the bed
pull back to reveal sarah staring at the screen
a bank of monitors display the various angles of the hall of habitats the laboratory and of course sebastian in the recovery room
linda hands sarah a cup of coffee
you gonna be okay
its not like i have anything else going on in my sad pathetic life
carterll be in at six to spell you and ill be in by nine
call me if anything happens okay
through the glass wall linda sees matt knocking and waving her out
go on ahead
the rest of the team straggles into the elevator
exhausted from the day
man im tired
that was a long day
days only get longer from here
linda catches matts eye
gives him a look
you coming over
matt nods yes imperceptible to everyone but linda
deserted and dark
sarah rubs her temples
her eyelids are heavy
shes having real trouble staying awake
the buzzing fluorescent light isnt helping either
the sheets ruffle and the indentation disappears from the bed
we can hear breathing and soft sound of bare feet shuffling against linoleum
camera slowly pans toward the door as if we are following someone walking
the door handle turns and the door pushes open
we slowly track down the hallway of the habitats
we hear the sounds of sleeping creatures
a couple of them growl at something unseen
the growling follows the invisible something as it passes by
the laboratory door opens and shuts again
we see papers shuffling at one of the work stations
a glass moves slightly
sarah reclines in her chair
fast asleep behind her is the glass wall revealing the empty hallway behind it
but a small portion of the glass fogs as if someone had just breathed on it
as the fogged part quickly clears we see the door to the observation room quietly open
on sarah still sleeping
we hear a whisper
are you awake
her heavy breathing mixes with sebastians
sebastians voice contd barely audible hmm
sarahs hair moves slightly as if a hand were running through it
and then we see her shirt move like fingers were tracing over it
down from the shoulder to her breast
around her nipple
sarah moans slightly as if she were dreaming but she doesnt stir
and then her breasts cup slightly as if they were being touched
her breathing becomes harder more labored erotic
and then she
bar eyes wide with fear
she jumps and cups her own breasts and looks around the room
its empty of course
she jumps over to the monitor and checks on sebastians room
the heat signature isnt there
are you in here
she tries holding her breath listening for his breathing
but theres nothing
sarah reaches over to a microphone
hits a few switches
sarah contd dr
caine please report in
caine report in please
she looks around the room
he must be in here
sarah contd dr
come on this isnt funny
i know youre in here
sarah waves her hand around reaching out trying to find him
after a few beats she stops and rubs her head
sarah contd i must be going crazy
suddenly sarah gets an idea
she quickly exits the observation room
at a wall storage box she removes a pair of thermal goggles and slips them on
sarah enters wearing the thermals
she scans the room
thermal pov the room is empty
she pulls the goggles off in frustration and when she glances over at the video screen she sees sebastians thermal image lying on the bed in the recovery room
sarah sinks into her chair a tad disconcerted
linda and matt finish listening to sarahs story
i found him later in the lab running samples
why didnt you call me
because i wasnt sure
im still not
i mean i couldve easily been dreaming
it doesnt sound like something sebastian would do
god i feel so stupid
i can talk to him
she torn unsure of herself it was probably nothing
i shouldntve mentioned it
yeah im sure
i mean yknow why would he do that right
just this place at night can be kinda creepy yknow
sebastian wearing surgical scrubs sits in an examination chair
wire leads sprout from the electrodes covering his head and arms
the electrodes seem to outline his body
so how was your first night
hard to sleep when you cant close your eyes
as sebastian talks we can see the electrodes around his jaw pump up and down
whatd you do
got up a couple of times
yeah sarah mentioned you werent in your cubicle
she said she called you over the intercom and you didnt respond
i guess i didnt hear
i had the radio on
itd be helpful to us if youd tell whoevers on duty where youre going to
i mean if something were to happen wed want to know where to find you
i didnt think it was a problem
i just dont want it to become one
machines pump out eeg ekg readouts
matt studies them
matt contd readings are normal
next i want to run a vv and uvf analysis of the platelets
well have to draw some more blood
sarah rolls up sebastians sleeve revealing empty air
she wraps a bungee cord around the nothing pulls it tight and sprays the inside of his elbow with dye
she acts very self conscious
you just seem a little nervous
this might hurt a bit
the surface of his skin sheens in the light as linda searches for a vein
she slaps his arm several times then plunges a hypodermic needle into his skin
his skin bends and gives
the needle remains in sight after it slips through the visible surface
sarah presses down on the hypo plunger releasing a dye into his bloodstream
sarah contd dr
this might sounds stupid but are you
are you looking at me
the red dye twists into a long snaking red tube up and down his arm
i was looking at the clock
sarah draws the plunger back sucking sebastians blood into the hypodermic and then yanks the needle out
just felt like someone was staring at me
sarah pulls the vial off the needle and labels it with a grease pencil
after a few beats the red dye in sebastians blood stream dissolves and disappears as does the liquid in the vial
matt slides sebastians sheet covered frame into an mri
even though his head is not visible it shown up on the mri scanner
carter and sarah lower a harness into a water tank
sebastians body displaces the water revealing an empty body shaped cavity in the water
carter sips a big gulp and stares at a monitor which shows two eat signatures in the recovery chamber huddled over a chess game
on a chessboard
a black knight takes white bishop seemingly all by itself
across the table matt leans back and topples his white king acknowledging defeat
janice and frank both don eye guards
frank switches on a low intensity laser on and its beam shoots across the room
the beam distorts slightly in the center of the room
as frank widens the spectral pattern suddenly the beam splits into a million different spectral rainbows momentary illuminating sebastians entire frame in a glowing tingle of light
linda pulls vials from the cyclotrons and props blood sample slides
she slips them under the microscope
she takes a sip of her diet coke and puts it on the table
she pears into the microscope and analyses the blood sample squeezing more stain onto it
she looks up to make notations but when she reaches for her diet coke it isnt there
she looks around
its on the other side of her microscope
she shrugs it off she takes a sip and sets it down where it was before
she peers into the microscope again and when she looks up
the diet coke is gone
she looks around the room and sees it on another table completely
we hear sebastians laughter echo in the room
youve no idea how much fun ive had
im going to hate going back
thats what worries me
what happens when we turn the project over to the army
ever wonder how much fun theyre gonna have
maybe we wont give it to them
his voice comes from behind her now
we see indentations on her shoulders where his fingers press down
sebastians voice contd i was thinking
tonights my last night
ever fantasize about making love to an invisible man
linda pulls away from him
stop it sebastian
its not funny
well dont do it for me
do it for science
linda walks away
missed your big chance
got some sleep
big day tomorrow
a bevy of activity below us as the scientists prepare
matt slides the antigen cocktail into the centrifuge and starts it spinning
a sheet drapes over a sebastians frame straps across his limbs
he is fully wired
linda looks up to the observation booth
frank peers down at her from the booth his voice echoing through the chamber
subject doctor sebastian caine
currently in phase shift
three days seven hours
de phase protocol
injecting serial protein caine one two seven
matt removes the glowing vial of orange liquid from a centrifuge nearby
carter hands matt a hypo
matt jabs it into the vial drawing up the colored liquid
linda sprays sebastians arm with dye
linda contd ready
i was just starting to enjoy myself
here we go
matt inserts the hypo into the vein and presses down on the plunger
the liquid begins to react
small flashes of light blip up and down the strand of color outlining the vein
the heartbeat starts to speed up
something doesnt feel right
janice and frank look over the equipment
vitals still nominal
the glowing liquid turns from gold to red as the complex webbing of a bloodstream appears
spreading out from the bloodstream soon becomes visible the shadow of a skeletal system
i cant br
sebastian begins wheezing
hes not breathing
muscles are beginning to appear
sebastian pulls against his bonds
one set tears off
carter grabs onto the mass of flesh and muscle trying to hold it back
but the restraints snap
the half visible man is screaming
he grabs carter and throws him across the room
linda contd sebastian
and just for a second sebastian is fully visible
he looks around like a scared animal and rips off all the wiring
linda contd sebastian
get a tranq
sarah preps a tranquilizer
sebastian locks eyes with linda
hes lost he doesnt know where he is
and suddenly he crumbles to the ground
linda rushes over to him and puts bar hand on his shoulder
light bleeds from his skin and his skin begins to dissolve from sight
got him on the table
matt linda and sarah pull the shifting body up and onto an operating table
carter pulls himself up and heads back to the group
linda contd get me a i
i got no pulse
carter locates sebastians heart not a difficult thing because we can actually see it
carters hand pushes down in the air inches above the heart
we see the heart being pushed and squeezed
sarah slaps an air bag on sebastian and starts pumping air into his lungs
sebastians heart begins to beat again beat on its own
getting a pulse
can you hear me
can you hear me
how are his pupils
i cant see his goddamn pupils
i think hes going into shock
we slowly fade out to the sights and sounds of our scientist doctors working on sebastian
and the beeping of sebastians erratic heartbeat
the heartbeat continues
in the shadows two rhesus monkeys defend themselves against an unseen attacker
blood splatters against the plexiglas wall
we fade out again
linda stares through the plexiglas walls into the recovery chamber
inside the chamber sarah and carter eye the various screens monitoring sebastians vitals
linda watches the hollow pocket underneath the blanket
she watches the rhythm of its rises and falls as sebastian sleeps
matt comes up behind her
just got the tissue sample results
cellular cohesion is stable
linda exhales in relief
matt puts his hands on her shoulder
pulls her close to him
matt contd how bout you
you gonna be okay
beat i was just thinking about the apollo missions
grissom white and chaffee
what it was like for them on that launch pad that day thinking they were gonna reach the stars only to burn to death
sometimes the test pilots make history
sometimes the planes crash and people die
but he didnt die did he
beat what if we cant bring him back
its just a little hitch is all
hell be the first to tell that hell crack it and im sure he will
itll just take time
beat listen lets got out of here
we could drive up to the old observatory
well take some wine and go count the stars and forget all this for awhile
she pulls away
i want to be here for him
linda pushes through the door of the recovery chamber and takes a seat by sebastians bedside
a little hurt matt heads down the corridor
frank and janice are staring into their coffee when matt enters
matt crosses to the coffee machine and pours himself a cup
he takes a seat at the table
they all drink their coffee in silent vigil
linda sits by sebastians bedside listening to the constant rhythm of the machines
the sheets shift
so i guess it didnt work
linda shakes her head
you look worried
it mustve been bad
sebastians voice is weak and strained
you almost died
well remember your nietchze
whatever doesnt kill me makes me stronger
i should be making you feel better
not vice versa
i guess if im going to be stuck this way for awhile id better make some adjustments
in a dusty shaft of light
a cotton swab
is dipped by a gloved hand into a jar of flesh colored cream make up
we follow the hand as it raises the cotton swab into the darkness
the swab strokes over the black and the rich fleshy cream spreads revealing
eye lids of a closed eye
the eyelids part unveiling
not even a trace of a eye socket
a colored contact lens floats through mid air
hovering before the eyelids
it turns and fastens itself to the darkness between the lids
we pull back slowly as sebastian lifts a latex face mask and pulls it over his head
he checks his reflection in the mirror
he looks almost human
a face eyes hands
the rest of him covered by surgical scrubs
we pull back and see the rest of the team looking on
not too bad
the latexll limit the amount of light delivered to my optic nerves
you could almost pass for human
he looks eerily removed from reality with his cold blank expression
well it gives you a face to talk to at least and we can all work in normal light again
carter draws blood from sebastian
samples are placed into the cyclotron
matt peers through the eyepiece of a microscope
he makes notes
frank and janice finish a computer simulation on a protein strand
matt looks over
they shake their heads no
sebastian slides into the mri
linda examines a petri dish
she throws her pencil down in frustration
sebastian is hit by the spectral radiation beams
matt pulls a vial of orange liquid from the cyclotron
sebastian still in his latex and scrubs but looking like hes been dragged through the nine levels of purgatory is escorted back to the recovery chamber by linda and matt
he crosses to his bed and collapses on it
closes his eyes
the testings making me sick
could be the barium or the radiation
youre physiology has changed and well all bets are off
i cant believe i have to spend another night here
to linda suppose youre gonna go home now meet up with that boyfriend of yours now
linda and matt exchange a glance
linda quickly covers
do you want me to stay
its just being a guinea pig is more work than i thought
ill be fine
various shots of the empty hallways and deserted labs
carter kicks back in his chair listening to his walkman stereo and playing gameboy
sebastian in scrubs and make up paces back and forth
he slams the wall in frustration
he crosses to a mirror and examines himself
he doesnt look half bad
he pokes his cheeks
theres something about him thats a little off but only if you look close
a shadow falls across carters face
he looks up
its sebastian wearing street clothes jeans and a hooded sweatshirt over his latex mask
carter pulls of his earphones
just stopped by to let you know im going out for a bit
sebastian turns back into the hallway
hey wait a sec
carter scrambles to his feet
carter catches up with sebastian
what do you mean going out for a bit
if i dont get out of here im gonna go crazy
but youre not supposed to leave the compound
thats the rule
yes but i made that rule
its my rule and im changing it
you cant just change it
sebastian hits the elevator button
the doors open
carter i was suppose to be like this for three days
three fucking days and ill be damned if im going to spend the rest of my life as a prisoner in this godforsaken dump
now im going out
ill be back in a couple of hours
the elevator doors close with sebastian inside
carter runs down the corridor
carter picks up the phone and dials
a beat then
yeah its carter
we got a problem
the elevator doors open and sebastian pushes past the marine guard
havent seen you for awhile
sebastian keeps his face turned away as he crosses to his porsche
you know how it in sometimes
you got that right sir
i was beginning to worry cause your car hadnt moved
thanks but everythings cool
sebastian starts his car
it chugs a few times before turning over and speeding out of the warehouse
the door opens and sebastian switches on the lights
he looks around his apartment and sighs
its good to be home
sebastian enters the bedroom clicking on the light
he looks at the ceiling you should be working and smiles
linda and matt each rush to their respective cars
he could be anywhere
hell he could be right behind us
ill meet you at the lab
im gonna swing by his place just in case
see you there
matt tries to give her a quick pack
linda backs away
quietly looking around i dont want him to see
looking around too what a mess
they get in their cars
sebastian packs up a few personal belongings in an overnight duffle
he crosses to his bookcase and pulls out some books and throws them into the bag
but as he does he notices a light come on in the window across the courtyard
sebastian turns off his bedroom light and moves toward the window
he peers across the courtyard into the brunettes apartment
he watches the brunette as she comes into the living room from her front hallway
she drops her keys on the table and begins unbuttoning her blouse as she crosses to the window
just as the blouse slips off her shoulder she pulls her blinds shut
frustrated sebastian steps away from the window and then stops
something has occurred to him
sebastian contd dont even think it
he looks down and notices his hand is trembling
his breathing is a little heavy
a little nervous
he catches a glimpse at himself in the mirror
sebastian contd almost whispering once
the brunettes living room light switches off and the bathroom light switches on
we see him fighting an internal battle and we see him lose it
he grabs a hold of his hand and peels the latex skin off
linda drives sebastians apartment
she spots his black porsche in the parking lot
she pulls over to the curb jumps out of her car and heads into the building
wearing just a robe the brunette turns on her shower
the doorbell rings
with a frustrated sigh the brunette rises
she peers through the peep hole
no ones there
but as she turns she hears the doorbell again
she opens the door steps out into the hallway and looks around
puzzled she heads back inside her apartment
we follow her as she crosses to her bedroom but a moment later the bedroom door closes on its own
we hear a scream come from the other side
then a muffled struggled
linda exits the elevator and heads down to sebastians door
she knocks again
and then she tries the door
she pushes the door open
linda pushes through the living room into the bedroom
she notices that the bathroom light is on
on the floor she finds sebastians clothing and on the vanity she sees his latex face and hands
she scramble for the bedroom phone and quickly dials
linda contd yeah matt its me
he was here
hes taken his make up off
i dont know
he must be outside somewhere
i dont know where he went
im coming back to the lab
howm i supposed to do that
i cant fucking see him
were going on alpha call
i want everyone at the lab now
were gonna need thermal visors and we may need tranqs
as she hangs up the phone and heads out
the camera doesnt follow but instead pushes through the blinds and out the window
as we cross the courtyard we begin to hear muffled cries of terror
we hold on the brunettes window as we
the bedroom door opens and we see the brunette nude and curled up on the bed sobbing
we follow the sounds of heavy breathing to the front door of her apartment
the door opens and we push out into the hallway
we can see indentations of feet appear on the hallway carpet
the elevator doors open and linda steps inside
the doors close shut behind her
a beat later we see the indentations of footsteps come around the corner
we follow the breathing and stumbling footfalls back into
we push over to the bathroom sink
the faucet turns on and the water starts running
we see the water cup under the faucet and splash against sebastians face
his face appears briefly in the water
then the water slips away
for second it sounds like hes crying but then we hear something far worse
matt hands out thermal goggles while frank loads and passes out tranquilizer guns
what are the tranqs for
use your imagination
are you saying hes dangerous
were just saying we need to be cautious
the metro stops running after midnight and hes on foot so he cant have gotten too far
look this isnt a monkey were talking about
dont you think youre over reacting
this program is classified
if hes out there it means someone might find out about him
he could destroy the whole program
no ones gonna find out
they all turn around
at the door is sebastian back in his latex outfit
where the hell have you been
i got a little stir crazy so i went to my apartment to pick up some stuff
i went to your apartment and i happen to know you did a helluva lot more than pick some stuff up
what are you talking about
you of all people how could you
caught dead to rights sebastian sinks into his chair
he thinks she knows
linda contd you put yourself and this project at risk
just what did you see in my apartment
i saw your face and your clothes
it was bad enough you left without an escort but to take off the
he motions to his face out in public
sebastian realizes that they dont know
dont make a mountain out of molehill
i didnt let anyone see me
thats not good enough
when youre outside the lab there are a thousand variables none of us can control
its just not safe for you to be out there
come on linda
you dont expect me to be some kind of prisoner
you volunteered for this sebastian
you knew going in there could be consequences
beat for the security of this project im gonna have to ask you to confine yourself to the compound
im still project leader linda
its my decision to make
its your decision
but if you leave the compound again ill notify the oversight committee
then they can make the decision
youd do the same if it were the other way around
a long beat
sebastian slowly rises acknowledges linda with a nod and leaves the room
linda looks around at her silent co workers the goggles and tranqs still on the table
pack em up
everyone go home
the lab is buzzing with the usual activity
linda rolls up sebastians sleeve revealing nothing
she wraps a bungee cord around the nothing and pulls it tight
she then sprays the inside of his elbow with dye
contentious how much blood do you think youve taken so far
the surface of his skin sheens in the light as linda searches for a vein
she slaps his arm several times then plunges a hypodermic needle into his skin
not enough to worry about
feels like youre sucking me dry
linda presses down on the hypodermic plunger releasing a dye into his bloodstream
sebastian contd its funny
all these years ive known you i never pegged you for a megalomanic
what are you talking about
the shoe being on the other foot
you getting to run things
i didnt ask for this caine
but when a classified experiment disappears in the middle of the night someones gotta run the show
tries sympathy look i know how hard this has been for you
he knocks her arm away and pulls the hypo out of his arm
dont patronize me
beat and for the record youve got no idea what its like
i get up every morning and you people stick needles in me
you bombard me with radiation until i vomit
and then at six its over for you
you get to go home
but sebastian is still here
sebastian cant leave or else
thats the worst part you know
here i have this
this gift and i cant even use it
now its a gift
youre goddamn right its a gift
and if you werent so goddamned short sighted id be out there right now trying to master it
sebastian looks around at the other scientists staring at him
he tosses the hypo with the needle onto the instrument tray and heads toward the door
wherere you going
looks like im going nowhere
come on man
weve got a ton of tests scheduled today
do them yourself
linda enters to find sebastian reading the collected works of t
want to talk about it
linda looks over his shoulder
we are the hollow men the stuffed men headpieces filled with straw
ive become a literal metaphor
he puts the books down
i dont want to fight you
i just want whats best for the program
and you being right doesnt make it any easier for me
you can be scared
im not scared of being stuck this way
with a little more make up and practice i could
he motions to his face pass
yknow get by in the world
but the testing
youre talking like youve given up
its only been a few months
what if its years
i dont know how much more testing i can take
sebastian paces back and forth glancing at the camera
linda matt and sebastian in latex and scrubs stare at an electron microscopes video display
on the screen in a sparse colony of blood calls but every second more and more cells appear filling the gap
the others in the lab listen
they start to get excited
janice and carter leave their research and come over to watch the screen
weve got it
weve got it
linda points to a blank patch on the screen
thats all we need
come on baby
but the blood cells nearest the blank patch twinkle out existence and then those around them also blink away until after a beat the screen is empty
full quantum cascade at
beat im sorry
youre fucking sorry
sebastian picks up a glass beaker and hurls it against the wall
sebastian contd six weeks of this shit and youre sorry
he grabs more equipment and begins tossing it in a rage
carter and janice grab him and restrain him
after struggling against them a beat or two sebastian calms down and pushes away from them and heads out the door
i dont blame him
ill go talk to him
leave him alone
he just needs to blow off some steam
sebastian lies in his bed staring at the security camera
the camera stares back at him
as if from a dream we hear the brunettes muffled scream and cries for help
as we push in on sebastians cold eyes we can barely make out her face thrashing back in forth in panic and confusion
sebastian suddenly rises
he crosses to the video camera and examines a small panel on the underneath of the camera
he reaches into a box of twinkies and pulls out one of the sponge cakes and begins munching
he hits the intercom button on the phone
im going to the lab
dont you sleep
waste of time
da vinci never slept
frank eyes sebastian in the monitor
im here if you need me
he watches as sebastians heat signature moves toward the door
in the dark deserted lab sebastian pulls together a circuit board a computer chip and some wiring
he seems be assembling something
sebastian crosses underneath the camera
just out of its range
reaches up and using a screwdriver unscrews the access panel
he scans the electronics and attaches two alligator clips to wires on the circuit board
trailing a long length of wire sebastian crosses back to his bed and lies down
he holds a black project box with a button on it
he lies perfectly still and press the button
the video image of the recovery chamber flickers slightly before returning to normal
sebastian rises and begins to peel off his latex
sebastians pov various animals stir restlessly
a dog visible leaps against the plexiglas barking wildly
we push further down the corridor
again sebastians pov as he pushes through the open door of the observation room
we see frank sorting through various computer readouts highlighting certain coding sequences
we push in until we are looking over franks shoulder at the video monitor
according to the video sebastian is sleeping soundly in his room
the rewired security camera stares down at the empty bed
frank glances over at the video monitor
he can see sebastians heat signature lying in the bed
frank feels something on his neck
he flicks whatever it is away with his hand and goes back to work
the elevator door opens
the guard turns around
the elevator is empty
a metro subway train draws to a halt
with a cautionary bing bong its doors slide open
a handful of people exit and enter
one man bumps shoulders
he turns round to apologize but theres no one there
the doors close and the train pulls out of the station
a couple of pretty girls exit a bar and stumble to their apartments
one of the girls enters her apartment
the door half closes behind her and then reopens and closes again
franks reading a book when linda and matt enter
howd it go
he worked in the lab till about and then went to sleep
close on the security camera
the wires have been removed and the access panel replaced
sebastian whistles a cheerful tune as he finishes applying his makeup
the door opens and linda and matt enter
ah my two favorite people
why so cheery this morning
you know some days you just wake up feeling the world is full of potential
like your eyes have been opened
im happy if i make it to my coffee machine
linda hands sebastian a disk
i restructured the third genome on your radiated protein strand
thought you might want to take look
cook up a batch and lets see where we go
i thought youd want to take a look at it
i trust you
now if youll excuse me i need to have my head examined
linda pulls bags of frozen plasma from the shelves in the walk in storage freezer
im telling you i know him
somethings going on
think he knows about us
if he knew about us hed be angry and that wasnt angry
janice heads up one of the corridors when something on the floor catches her eye
she bends down and takes a look at it
barely visible on the floor is a fragment of a barefoot footprint
she runs her finger along the dried mud
it turns to dust
sebastian holds his latex head on his lap while eeg leads hang suspended in mid air outlining his real head
carter analyzes the results
when you were a kid you ever dream about being invisible
all the time
what did you imagine youd do
whats the usual
hanging out in the girls locker room
kicking jimmy margianis ass
drove a red trans am
back then i was the size of a small planet and made a rather large target
ever think up anything along the grand scale
manipulating stock markets consolidating a political power base
but those are more recent fantasies
carter pulls off the electrodes and sebastian slides on his latex facemask
and what if it werent fantasy
what if you were out there in the world and could do whatever you wanted with no consequences whatsoever
how far would go
if it were real
i dont know man
out in the real world
i mean theres a responsibility
lets say you saw a woman with amazing tits
would you brush against them
hell i try and do that now
so if you could get away with more would you do more
i read that in a survey at a major university they asked college students would you steal if you were guaranteed to get away with it
eighty two percent
makes you wonder if the worlds ready for what were doing
so doc what did you do
what do you mean
when you were out
i just walked around
aw you just walked around
theres more right
man id be walking up to people saying shit like this is god go get a haircut
or hanging out in the changing room at victorias secret
kind of sophomoric dont you think
besides it was late and i wasnt out that long
well did you see anybody
there was this one girl
and did you mess with her
sebastian gives carter a sly grin
sebastian contd well maybe a little
beat i tell you though a man could get used to it
alone linda packs up her stuff for the evening
slowly we push in on her and hear quiet breathing
we realize we are in
sebastians voice contd sorry didnt mean to frighten you
i just didnt know you were there
as she leaves the lab he follows her down the hallway
linda passes through the revolving doors of her apartment building
a few beats later as if caught by a gust of wind the revolving door slowly turns on its own
linda slips into her apartment and the door closes behind her
a moment later we see the doorknob turn back and forth
on a fire escape we see the ladder shake and descend to the ground
the metal rattles back and forth as if something were climbing it
we slowly crane up the fire escape and hold on a window
through the wispy curtains and dirty glass we can see linda enter the room
the panel of glass fogs from sebastians breath
the fog wipes away seemingly by itself
but then through the window we see matt walk into the living room and put his arms around lindas waist
we hear a shocked intake of air
he kisses her neck and then slowly unzips her dress
her dress falls to the floor
matt takes off his sport coat and drapes it over a chair while linda unfastens the buttons of his shirt
theyre laughing now exchanging kisses
matt reaches behind linda and unhooks her bra
he kisses his way down her neck to her breasts
linda pulls him to her
suddenly the window shatters
startled both matt and linda jump back covering themselves
we hear sebastians footsteps as he retreats down the fire escape
a moment later matt reaches the window and peers out
he sees the fire escape ladder slowly rise back up down below
what was it
i dont know
i dont see anything
matt picks up a piece of glass and examines it
matt contd its like something hit it
linda picks up the phone and dials
carter picks up the phone
carter looks at the security monitor of the recovery room
sebastians heat signature lies still on the bed
carter contd no
hes here no im staring at him
hes right there in his room
linda breathes a sigh of relief
no just checking
hangs up phone phew
matt pulls her into him
where were we
barking can be heard in the background
that horrible repetitive barking that grates the soul like chinese water torture
a photograph of linda drifts through the air and settles atop a flaming candle
it ignites into fire twisting and turning in mid air then falling on the floor as ash
a beat later water runs from the sink faucet
it forms in the shape of hands and splashes against his face dripping away
sebastians voice contd and the cyclops screamed out who is it who blinds me
and odysseus replied nobody is my name
and the cyclops raged to his friends nobody is killing me
the barking continues
a moment later the chamber door slides open
we push down the
until we are face to face with the unhappy barking dog
its nobody its nothing
the plexiglas door to the doggies cage swings open and some invisible force grabs little doggie around the neck
the force squeezes its little fur ball throat until the barking stops
sebastians voice contd nobodys gonna hurt you
the force keeps squeezing until the little doggie goes limp
then the dog smashes against the plexiglas over and over until blood spills out its mouth
the plexiglas door swings closed again and moments later the door to sebastians cubicle closes as well
the water runs in sebastians sink washing the blood away from his now half visible hands
sarah sees the dead dog lying prone on its bedding
she eyes it curiously and opens the cage door
sarah stares at the empty chamber
i am now
the sheets raise and drape off of him
notice anything unusual last night
sebastian pulls a sheet around him
he moves across the dimly lit room like a ghost
his neck was broken and his windpipe collapsed
howd that happen
i thought maybe you could tell me
you saying i had something to do with it
he was alive last night when i left and he was dead this morning
and you were the only one down here
i was in my room all night
sarah sits with carter as they run through the security video tape
matt and linda look over their shoulder
thats all twelve hours
he never left the room
a windpipe doesnt just suddenly collapse
someone or something killed it
you saw the tape
the man was in his chamber
then we have a problem because i the cage was locked from the outside
that means it was opened the dog was killed and the cage was closed and locked again
only a human could do that
well it wasnt me
and it wasnt him
are we sure
linda passes sebastians chamber
sebastians in latex
any big plans for tonight
quiet night at home
maybe a book
whatever happened to that guy your were seeing
hes still in the picture
being locked down here im forced to live vicariously
someday youll have to tell me what hes like
maybe someday i will
see you in the morning
sebastian watches linda walk away
he glances at the camera and starts to peel off his face
the elevator door opens
sebastians pov as we push past the guard and down onto the street
we hear whistling
splashes of water splat out from shallow puddles as sebastian walks through them
sebastians pov a car approaches
as it drives by we see matt and linda inside heading back to the warehouse
the footsteps stop
we see the footsteps start to head back toward the warehouse
linda and matt exit their car and cross toward the elevator
to marine guard forgot something
as we watch the footsteps head back through the puddles toward the warehouse we see frank pass us in his car
what the hell
he breaks into a run
feet splash water and he races back toward the warehouse
the elevator door opens and we push out into the hallway
sebastians pov we follow sebastian down the hallway to his cubicle
but as he rounds the corner he quickly ducks back
the entire research team is in his cubicle
sebastian slowly approaches and watches as frank takes down his video board
pretty clever really
all it does is recycle the signal
he flips this switch it takes a snapshot and thats all we see
and you think hes violent
he killed a dog with his bare hands
dogs arent people
are we in any danger
linda doesnt know
either way we arent equipped to handle this
we have to inform the committee
everybody murmurs in agreement
what if he doesnt come back
theyll go after him
beat who has tonights shift
pretend nothings wrong
everyone just do what youre doing so he doesnt become suspicious
matt and ill go tell doctor kramer and well lot the committee deal with it
sebastians pov he backs away and races down the hall
the stately stone house sits on a finely manicured lawn in one of the nicest neighborhoods in town
lindas car is parked on the curb in front
we break from a typical establishing shot and as the camera tracks closer to the house we realize that we are we hear breathing and footsteps as we push through
some bushes and head toward a bay window which looks into the kramer living room
through the glass we see linda and matt seated across from dr
we cant hear what theyre saying but it certainly looks serious
kramer puffs on a pipe and strokes his beard shaking his head
kramer rises and shakes hands with linda and matt and the three of them head toward the front door
we move away from the window and track toward the front door
as the door opens we begin to hear the tail end of the conversation
ill call general caster right now and convene the oversight committee tomorrow
thank you sir
what do we do in the meantime
just sit tight and wait for my call
matt and linda head down to her car
kramer heads back inside
kramer heads back into the living room
his wife appears a the upstairs railing
what was that about
just a little trouble at work
you coming up
in a minute
i have to make a few calls
kramer retreats back to her bedroom as dr
kramer crosses over to the telephone
he picks up the receiver and starts dialing
in the middle of dialing the phone goes dead
he clicks the hookswitch up and down trying to get a dial tone
he checks the connections on the phone and then follows the wiring to the wall
the lines plugged in
he hears a door creak open in the kitchen
kramer contd hello
kramer crosses to the darkened kitchen
the kitchen door leading to the backyard is open
puzzled he crosses to it
a wind stirs across the pool and backyard swirling dead leaves in small twists of wind
the windchime rings lightly
kramer steps out
in the dim spillover light from house kramer crosses to the telephone box against the back of the house
it is open and several of the wires have been pulled
he looks around spooked and puffs out a cloud of smoke from his pipe
for the briefest of instants sebastians face is visible in the smoke
kramer jumps back in surprise and the pipe drops from his mouth
he gives a small sharp cry but deep indentations appear across his mouth and his cries are stifled
in the darkness we can make out his form writhing as if possessed
the struggle continues a beat until kramer manages to break free
as kramer runs he looks behind him
but no ones there
something slams into kramer and he tumbles rolling into the pool
but as he hits water theres not just one splash but two
in the water next to him is human shaped air pocket
its sebastian displacing the water
and because of the water displacement we can clearly see two arms pushing kramer beneath the waters surface
martha kramer opens the bedroom window and looks down at the pool
all she can see is her husband drowning
his flailing limbs kicking up a massive air bubble around him
she races from the window
kramer kicks and flails for a few moments and then his limbs stop moving
a moment later he floats to surface face down
the air pocket bobs over to the pool ladder and rising from the pool we see sebastians body outlined in sheets of water
the shape melts away in a cascading waterfall until all we can see of sebastian are the hundreds of tiny droplets still clinging to his body caught in the light
like twinkling bulbs on a christmas tree
the shape disappears into the darkness
a moment later martha emerges from the house and sees her husband floating face down in the pool
linda passes by sebastians chamber
no good morning for me
dont you like me anymore
im in a hurry
its going to be busy day
matt sits across from her twirling a pen in his hand
they both stare at the phone
when did he say held call
hes probably meeting with the committee trying to figure out what to do
im gonna call him
linda picks up the phone and dials
linda contd yes dr
inhales sharply surprised when
im so sorry
linda blanches as she hangs up the phone
drowned in his pool last night
linda picks up the phone again and dials
linda contd yes general thompson please
as she waits the phone line clicks dead
linda contd hello
she clicks on the hookswitch
let me see that
he tries it too
matt contd intercoms working but there doesnt seem to be an outside line
they waste no time getting to the elevator
linda and matt step in
ill be right back with help
linda taps in his floor code
foster one delta eight three five
thats a first
linda taps the keypad again
foster one delta eight three five
let me try mine
matt hits buttons on the keypad
kensington two romeo one five nine
tell me this isnt happening
frank sarah carter and janice man various work stations in the lab
linda and matt enter
weve got a problem
franks fingers fly over the keyboard
how long before anybody starts looking for us
theres no set check in procedure
it could be weeks
a graphic of the elevator system pops up on the screen
frank highlights the security terminal
frank hits a few more keys
the screen reduces to a series of numbers
linda contd you think you can got in
frank rewrites a few of the numbers
it was only a second level encryption
the security system specifications pops up
some security system
oh the system is fine
its just im just extraordinary
frank types a few more keys and his eyes widen
frank contd but apparently someone is more extraordinary than me
what is it
theres nothing wrong with the system
our codes have been removed
heres a clue
only one code remains
the team approaches sebastians chamber
carter pulls on the pair of thermal goggles dangling from his neck up
thermal pov the chamber is empty
hes not in there
linda enters the chamber
she notes that sebastians face and makeup are on the sink vanity
linda crosses to the phone and hits the page button okay sebastian
tell us where you are
but i cant lot you turn me in
where are you
you have no idea what its like
the power of it
i cant let that go
youre scaring me
tell me where you are and we can talk about it
theres nothing to talk about
ive done things that cant be undone
a long beep as the intercom clicks off
beat i want search parties
thermal goggles and tranquilizers
linda and matt wearing thermal goggles and clutching tranquilizer pistols walk down the hallway scanning back and forth
janice enters the office
are you in here
suddenly janice jerks back
sarah scans all the habitats with a thermal scanner
janice struggles with her unseen assailant slamming into walls and knocking into filing cabinets
frank and carter search the lab with their thermal scopes
linda and matt knock
they push through the door
the room seems deserted
signs of a struggle
file cabinets opened drawers tossed
this is bad
thermal pov linda surveys the room spotting a slight heat signature peeking from the corner
theres something over there
linda moves toward it
whatever it is its hidden from matts pov by the supply cabinet
as linda gets close she pulls of f her thermal goggles to see
her face blue eyes bulging
cord wrapped around his neck
linda jumps back
linda contd jesus
oh my god
matt rushes over
sees the lifeless corpse
linda lowers the body to the floor
she was strangled
multiple blows to her head
linda begins a medical check of the rest of the body
matt stoops down and examines janices face
linda contd we got a big problem here
a lamp tumbles from the desk and smashes to the floor
both linda and matt jump
linda frantically dons the thermal visor and scopes the room again
matt notices the lamp cord beneath lindas leg
points it out to her
she sighs with relief
she pulled the lamp off the table
linda contd get everybody to the conference room
matt picks up the phone
clicks the hookswitch
clicks the hookswitch again
the phone lines
she checks the phone punches some numbers
linda contd it was just working
what the fuck is going on here
matt and linda head toward the lab
linda suddenly stops
linda takes a few cautious steps
linda contd give me the visor
matt suddenly concerned hands her the visor
thermal pov linda checks out the corridor
linda takes matts hand
linda contd cmon
they move quickly up the corridor
see frank sarah and carter
did you find him
janice is dead
linda scans the room with her thermal scope
matt frank janice and sarah step in locking the door behind them
the man has checked out of reality
i dont understand
isnt it obvious
right now were the only ones who knows he exists
if he gets rid of us no one knows and he becomes the most powerful man on earth
but hes not a killer
they all look at linda
he is now
can you fix the elevator
restore our codes
itd take hours to crack the encryptions
right now that sounds like good news
so what do we do until then
sit around waiting for him to kill us off
everyone looks around for some leadership
we find him before he finds us
the group moves quickly passing under an air vent
as they round the corner the vent slowly swings down and an air disturbance drops to the ground
as they enter
you sure thisll work
linda sits down at a computer terminal activates it
we designed it to help find the rats we kept dropping in year one
they were too small for thermal scans
a map of the compound appears on the screen
activating motion detectors
matt toggles a switch
linda stares at a map of the compound
blips appear on the display
in the observation room
in the habitat area and in one of the corridors
ive got movement in corridor six
a shadow edges down the tunnel
it settles for a moment disappearing completely then is back on the move
at the tunnels edges motion detectors light up as the thing passes by
carter checks his tranq pistol matt rummages through a locker
matt pulls out a pair of walkie talkies
he tosses one to linda
into walkie check
her voice echoes from the other unit
linda contd be careful
just watch our backs
hey carter ready
lets do it
matt and carter exit
linda locks the door behind them
matt and carter trot toward corridor six
linda huddles over the display tracking the two
into walkie take a right at the next accessway
hes working his way back to the offices
we see matt and carter on one of the working video screens as they push down the tunnel
matt and carter move cautiously listening for any sound
walkie sotto if we split up can we trap him on corridor eight
if he keeps heading in that direction
matt nods to carter
the pair splits heading down separate accessways
matt pulls the visor down over his eyes
linda watches the two separate and come around sebastian in a pincer move
suddenly the blip that was sebastian disappears
linda grabs the walkie
i lost him
matt i lost him
matt makes his way forward
he probably just stopped moving
but matt becomes more cautious with his footsteps
slowly approaching a corner
he rounds the corner and sees a heat signature at the far end of the corridor
he levels his pistol ready to fire
matt pulls off his goggles
do you have anything
how did he get by us
were here to help
they both don their visors and move forward slightly
carter holds up his hand
behind those pipes
hes not moving
matt checks his thermal
a red heat signature clings to the wall
carter contd doctor caine
beat can you hear me
into walkie we see him
but hes not responding
the heat signature doesnt move
matt looks through his visor and holds the tranquilizer gun at the ready
he looks for a clear shot
the heat signature huddles behind pipes
the two slowly move closer
matt finally has a clear shot
he signals carter
carter levels his pistol too
matt fires the dart at the heat signature
it bounces off the wall
he crosses to the heat signature
matt contd just a vent
just a goddamn vent he was there
looks like were pumping out heat
suddenly behind him
carter jerks three feet in the air kicking wildly
suspended in mid air by his neck
he gasps for air
i got movement again
hes right on top of you
no fucking shit
matt opens fire with the tranquilize shooting at the ceiling until he spends his dart rounds
matt contd sebastian
let him go
mmmmphg carter suffocates
he passes out
with a sudden crack hes thrown against the side wall
a large cut opens up across his head and his body goes limp
into walkie where is he
where the fuck is he
linda huddles over the display
right on top of you
matt scrambles away
pipes burst and swing down from the ceiling
steam billows forth
something moves through the cloud of steam
around the corner matt shoves more darts into his tranquilizer
whats going on
are you okay
bleeding from a head wound
linda watches the screen
two blips one traveling quickly
matt hes coming toward you
matt takes a few steps back
got outta there
matt breaks into a run
linda watches one dot chasing the other down several corridors
matt running checking over his shoulder
sounds of footsteps behind him but up ahead the heavy metal blast doors begin to close
the doors are closing
hes shutting me in
matt rushes the doors as they slide shut
he doesnt make it in time
the doors close with a resounding clang
matt turns and pulls on his thermals
matt contd where is he
linda huddled over the screen
hes coming right at you
then checks the thermal goggles
several heat signature dot the tunnel
twenty maybe thirty feet
goddamnit i got thermals all over the place
eight maybe ten of them
must be ghosts
linda gets a sense of forboding
she looks around the room
sees a heating vent in the corner
she grabs the walkie
theyre coming from the heating vents
through the goggles matt sees the tunnel turning red
im starting to lose resolution on my thermals
get out of there
if the room temperature is the same as his body temperature thermal visorsll be no good
linda grabs a tranq gun and heads for the door
its not safe
thats why im going
to frank and sarah corridor eight is clear
get carter to the lab
well meet you there
matt turns to face the corridor
its turning red
matt sees some movement in the thermal cloud
but the thermal signature disappears into the heat
matt cant distinguish anything through his goggles anymore
he pulls them off and holds him gun in front of him sweeping the hallway
his voice keeps shifting
sebastians voice contd not even close
matt sweeps his front leg back and forth like a blind man using a cane
but his foot isnt hitting anything
he sees a fire extinguisher mounted on the wall
he rushes it turns it on the hallway and sprays
and something lunges through the foam
grabs him sending him tumbling down the tunnel
matt is thrown against the wall
blood coming from his brow
he scrambles away spraying more foam
sees a shape in the mist raises his pistol and fires
the shape leaps away
the dart flies
matt scrambles back into a corner
his pistol is empty
just out of curiosity how long has my best friend been fucking my ex girlfriend
get a hold of yourself
you arent thinking rationally
shes a pretty sweet fuck isnt she
calm down sebastian
we can talk this through
its not too late
the shape parts the low hanging mist the fine powder swirling in clouds behind it
coming toward him
dont do this
im your friend
im sorry but i just feel that our friendship is holding me back
im sure you understand
the door opens
linda reaches through grabs matt
she pulls him to his feet and through the door
frank and sarah holding their tranq pistols fly down the corridor
they shear off the main corridor into the side corridor
carter lies crumpled up ahead
sarah slides to his side
carters head rests in a pool of blood
she checks his pulse while frank takes a protective position
sarah contd pulse is weak
hell be okay
its pretty severe
we have to get him to the lab
hes got to be okay
frank stands frozen
for godsakes help me
frank snaps to
grabs an arm
the pair hoist carter up and carry him down the hallway
linda pulls a handle and doors slide shut behind them
he was going to kill me
linda pulls him close
weve got to got out of here
linda checks the screen see sarah frank and carter headed toward the laboratory
matt contd where is he
goddamnit where is he
isolated in the hallway of habitats is a single blip
thats right between us and the lab
frank and sarah lift carter onto a medical table
his pulse is faint
sarah grabs a sheet from the counter top
folds it and presses it against the head wound
sarah contd hes lost a lot of blood
she guides franks hands to the wound
sarah contd keep applying pressure
sarah pulls out a saline solution i
bag and slap it on the rack
she fumbles with the needle as she tries to find a vein
sarah contd dont move your hand until i got back
sarah heads to the door
where are you going
thisll hold him but he needs blood
supply is right down the hall
ill be two seconds
sarah wait for the others if i wait hell die
keep pressure on the wound
sarah exits the lab
checks the corridor
down at the end of the cramped tunnel is the supply room
she swallows her fear and heads toward it all the while glancing side to side and behind her
spooked sarah bursts into the room
she goes to the supply fridge freezer pulls open the door and sorts through blood bags
matt and linda push along the corridor matt spraying with the fire extinguisher in short controlled bursts linda clutching her tranquilizer like a commando
a noise behind them
matt turns to blast with the extinguisher
the white chemical dust sprays out outlining a shape in the tunnel
but it isnt a human shape
matts uniform shreds
something with fierce sharp claws fells him
tearing into his flesh
we see a angry hungry face
jabbing for a moment through the lingering fog
linda tries to get a clear shot off through the smoke
matt trips and goes sprawling
her dart jabs into something which collapses to the ground
a moment of calm
as the dusty chemical foam settles the outline of a great ape appears still twitching
matt contd karl three
hes let the animals out
it wasnt him we were tracking
linda leans against the wall still clutching her tranq gun at the ready
the heat is getting to bar
bar scrubs are soaked her hairs a mess
she wipes the sweat from her brow
linda contd you okay
it wont kill me unless it gets infected
dont ask about me
if he freed all the animals we could have dozens running around the lab
so he could be anywhere right now
matt sprays the whole tunnel putting down a gentle cloud mist
nothing else appears
matt contd what do we do
get to the lab lock the goddamn doors and pray to god frank can reprogram the elevator
sarah finishes collecting blood bags and shuts the door to the fridge freezer
the door slams behind her
she freezes and slowly turns
she eyes the supply room looking for a sign of movement
sarah contd frightened whisper whos there
is that breathing she hears
now shes starting to panic
sarah contd dr
she starts to back away but shes already in the corner
she clutches her tranquilizer gun but theres nothing to aim at
the vials of blood on the shelf gives her an idea
she reaches over grabs a vial and throws it on the floor
glass shatters and blood smears across the linoleum
sarah tosses another vial and another
becoming more and more hysterical
splattering more and more blood
but she runs out of vials
shaking with fear she searches the blood looking for a footprint or movement
but theres nothing there
sarah waits a beat clutching the tranquilizer gun
takes a step
waits a beat longer
finally she relaxes
it was just her imagination
she heads toward the door when she hears a terrifying whisper in her ear
her hair flies up and she swings against the wall
she tries to move but shes pinned there
her hands struggling against the force
let me go
oh god let me go
the arm holding the tranquilizer gun begins to move
sarah contd what are you doing
sarah fights but her arm moves nonetheless sarah contd help me
somebody help me
slowly deliberately her own arm moves down the wall and around until the tranquilizer gun points right at her stomach
sarah watches in horror as her own body betrays her
sarah contd no
dont do this to me
she struggles shaking back and forth
in anguish and in fear
sarah contd what do you want
the trigger pulls
a dart explodes from the gun and imbeds in sarahs stomach
she whimpers as her eyes glass over
suddenly shes released
she stumbles backward and falls lifeless to the floor
a moment of stillness all we can hear is the sound of someone breathing
on sarahs face
a slight indentation runs down her cheek
and slight indentation runs across her breast and strokes down her body
the sense of violation and vulnerability is awful
ive always liked your feistiness
sarahs head shifts slightly
her head shifts violently accompanied by the celery crunch of her neck snapping
sebastian exhales his breath filled with the intoxication of power
frank applies pressure to the wound waiting for sarah to return
carters vital signs are weakening
to carter goddamnit
stay with me now
dont you let up
frank doesnt know whether to stay or go after her
he starts toward the door several times but cant leave carter
finally the door opens
frank contd sarah
im losing him
but its linda and matt
frank contd did you see her
linda rushes over to check on carter
where is she
she went to the supply room
carter needed blood
linda grabs a stethoscope and listens to carters heart
i said no one goes anywhere alone
she didnt listen
she slowly pulls franks hand away from the wound
frank contd but
linda would love to cry about it but doesnt afford herself the luxury
the three of them approach the supply room door slowly
blood trickles from under the door and bloody footprints extend down the hallway
they swing open the door
the floor is covered in blood and broken glass
but no body
sarah broken is dragged toward the chair eerily jerking down the hallway
seemingly on its own
the three scientists follow the bloody footprints down the hallway past the empty cages in the tunnel of habitats
all clutch their tranquilizer pistols
the footprints lead past the habitats to sebastians chamber
they see sarahs body in the dim light
the group breaks into a run
linda pushes into the chamber and falls at sarahs side
matt cradles sarahs head
they look for some sign of life as linda fights back the tears
linda contd no
linda slams the cubicle wall with her fist
this didnt happen
this hasnt happened
it happened alright
now we have to deal with it
matt puts his hands on her shoulder to calm her
she pushes him off
and just what are we supposed to do now
now you die
the three of them whip around
the three cautiously move out
they stand back to back each one facing out
they move toward the door of the chamber
linda contd sebastian
sebastian listen to me
they all their tranq pistols level waiting for some sign
hearing each other breathe
they slowly move outside the chamber into the corridor
i dont know if you can understand this but what youre experiencing is a psychological breakdown
this isnt who you are
i would say that what i am experiencing is psychological awareness
i like you being in complete and absolute control
they identify the general area the voice is coming from back inside the chamber
they slowly move toward the chamber door
with lightning speed they slam the door shut locking sebastian inside the recovery chamber
you goddamn bastard
you goddamn bastard
youre gonna pay for this
im going to bring you back to visibility and then im going throw your ass in jail
youre never gonna bring me back linda
i never want to come back
or maybe ill fuck you
one last time for old times sake
linda slams her fist against the wall of the chamber
dont listen to him
its not worth it
come on matt
lets go get the elevator back on line so we can got out of this hell hole
matt gives linda a kiss
he does anything anything at all come get us
ill be back to check on you in five
matt and frank head off down the corridor
imagine you two carrying on right under my nose
out of curiosity what did he give you that i couldnt
shut up sebastian
hes more of a man than youll ever be
a video screen shows linda pacing outside the chamber door
the chair moves forward toward a microphone
ill be quiet
if thats what you want
sebastian toggles the intercom switch off
we pan over to one of the working video screens
matt and frank stride down the hallway
the chair swivels and the observation room door swings open slightly
linda still holds his tranq gun toward the door
linda walks over to the plexiglas
cant see anything anyone
just the dead sarah
then she sees it
the little red light on the intercom
linda bangs on the glass
no movement no nothing
she takes off running
linda contd matt
tracking with linda as she rushes down the hall
linda contd matt
linda breaks in the room to see frank slicked in blood his throat cut and matt bleeding from multiple stab wounds with an extension cord around his neck being pulled
linda rushes over and slams into matt
they fall to the ground
linda crawls over to matt but her head snaps back and her lips erupt with blood
figured it out
you were always so clever
matts pulled back across the lab by the cord around his neck
he grabs at the cord trying to breathe
linda watches him being pulled away
she clamors over to him
but matt rises in the air and is tossed against the lab table
linda levels her dart pistol and fires haphazardly at the air
she hits nothing but objects jerk and move in a line as sebastian heads for cover
linda manages to grab matt and pull him to her
linda contd hang on
get out of here
linda pulls matt toward the door
yelling you wont get away with this
theyll find out about you
theyll hunt you down
the villagers with their torches
lock up your daughters
its not gonna happen that way
linda hits the lights
the lab is now very very dark
sebastians voice contd see ive spent all my time down here thinking up this plan
when they find you theyll find a pile of charred corpses
the result of a terrible accident im afraid
linda reacts to the voice as it grows nearer
she navigates the maze of equipment heading toward the crack of light at the front door
how can you be so brutal
i guess because i dont have to look at myself in the mirror anymore beat remember that first night i was out
i did something bad just to see if i could get away with it
and when i did i realized i could have it all
i can kill in broad daylight
and nobodys gonna tell the police they were fucked by a ghost
anything i desire i can make happen but not if people know
linda and matt have reached the door of the lab
she pushes through it and slams it behind her
linda pulls matt along
i cant feel my legs
just keep going
ill fix you later
the doors explode open
linda looks up and down the hall and pulls matt inside the supply room
its still blood soaked from earlier
linda closes the door sliding the deadbolt into place
linda lots him drop like a heap onto the floor
she falls to her knees beside matt lying on the ground
stay with me now
linda pulls his scrubs open
the wounds are many and deep
he surprised us
we werent expecting
something slams against the door
slams against it again
the old deadbolt is buckling
linda looks around the room and sees the storage freezer
linda contd we gotta move
linda helps matt up and into the storage freezer
linda grabs a metal bar and slides it between two hooks on the door and the jam
the storage room door blows open
linda leans down next to matt
he entire shirt is stained with blood
hes having trouble breathing
matt contd i cant feel anything
linda picks up his hand
grips it tight
you feel that
she rips his shirt open
and sees his wounds
she grabs a vial of alcohol and dumps it on her hands and then probes the wound
your losing blood but he didnt hit the vitals
she looks around
linda contd sutures and thread
she rises and looks outside the porthole into the room
suddenly it fogs up and she almost sees a face
she stumbles backward and the door starts rattling
linda scrambles over to hold the metal crowbar in place
sebastian pulls and rattles on the freezer door
to no avail
its not gonna budge
finally he gives up
the door stops shaking
linda is relieved briefly
then she hears the click of the door locking
close on the regulator as the dial turns from forty five degrees down to negative twenty
through the porthole linda sees the bloody footprints heading toward the door
she removes the metal bar and pushes on the door
it wont move
linda looks around the storage room
she grabs a roll of duct tape and pulls off a length
whatre you doing
this is temporary
she takes paper towel and cleans off matts wound
she tapes it using duct tape
linda contd you still with me
a beat later the compressor begins pumping arctic air into the freezer
just keeps getting worse
linda returns to the door
we hear whistling as we see a sheet of flesh fill out into a head as sebastian slides on his latex head piece
linda continues shaking the door
the lock holds
a tear rolls down lindas cheek but a strange thing happens
the tear drops freeze
linda shivers as she pulls the icy tears from her face
the inside thermometer has dropped to five degrees
linda grabs the metal bar and starts smashing it against the porthole
the metal bar just bounces off the glass
a drawer opens revealing a set of clothing neatly folded
shirt pants shoes
they begin to move
linda drops the metal bar and slides down the wall defeated
theres no way out
theres got to be
they say freezing to death isnt so bad
you just kinda pass out
matts head rolls back
she checks his pulse
thank god he still has one but hes not gonna last long
theyre both already starting to turn a little blue
linda stares desperately up at the shelves trying to find some sort of advantage
then she sees something
she looks back at the door lock and then she rises
and grabs an extension cord coiled on the shelf
linda contd were not dying in here
sebastian dressed in street clothes stands before the mirror applying make up to his latex mask
linda finishes stripping the insulation off the electric cord
she grabs a hypodermic needle package and her cold fingers fumbles with the package as she tries to pull out the plastic tube
she finally gets it out and she starts wrapping the stripped electric wire around the tube in a tight coil
sebastian slides on a wig and checks his appearance in the mirror
even from relatively close up he could pass as normal
linda furiously winds wire into a coil
sebastian heads down the corridor
lingering steam twists in and around the hallway long wispy tendrils
sebastian pauses for a moment hearing a growl
suddenly the hallway seems a lot scarier
from beneath his scrubs he pulls his own tranq gun
hearing scraping and footsteps
watching the water on the floor twitch
with machine like precision he turns and fires
the tranq dart halts in mid air and some invisible thing tumbles over
sebastian continues down the hallway
linda holds the plug end of the extension cord
the other end is wrapped into a tight long coil
linda looks for an outlet but cant find one
she looks at the overhead lights
a moment later shes climbing up the shelving
she wrap a piece of fabric around her hand and with a sharp punch she smashes one of the overhead light bulbs
sebastian enters fully dressed
at a distance itd be hard to tell his secret
he pulls several chemicals off the shelves
then he pulls a tray of test tubes over and begins mixing
linda works on jerry rigging the two ends of the wire to the lightbulb socket
suddenly the coiled wire springs to life and flies against the nearest metal surface
shes made an electromagnet
sebastian loads the filled test tubes into the centrifuge
dozens of other vials are already slotted
he takes one of the left over vials considers it a moment and then flings it over to the other side of the lab
the vial shatters and
a powerful explosion that rocks the room
linda feels the rumbling as she places the coil up against the door
the magnet attaches itself
linda shakes the coil trying to get the doorlock to move
we see the lock twitching
linda shivers as she plays with the coil
her eyes glaze and she stumbles backward
her surgical scrubs once soaked with sweat are now frozen stiff
she composes herself and pushes back toward the door
her heavy breath hangs as a low cloud of mist
sebastian looks over the dozens of other test tubes calculating their combined power in his mind
then he closes the top of the centrifuge
he taps a few commands into its timer
the door lock twitches again and twists back
the door swings opens and linda stumbles out mashing into a supply shelf of oxygen canisters
the canisters tumble every which way as linda tumbles to the ground
she scrambles to her feet and goes in after matt pulling his cold body out of the storage locker
she pulls stacks of paper down from the shelves into a trashcan grabs an industrial lighter and ignites the paper
she pushes matt close to the small bonfire
as she does the oxygen tanks catch her eye
sebastian exits the lab locking the door behind him
he heads down the darkened tunnel
something scampers in front of him
small not visible
sebastian sends it reeling with a swift violent kick
sebastian dressed and in full latex comes striding up the tunnel
he taps a code into the elevator vault doors
the vault doors open revealing the elevator
the doors slide open and sebastian steps inside
one one one one one
and theres linda
slicked with dirt and blood
she holds a oxygen container with a cut line
linda contd i cant let you leave
come on out and ill give you one last chance
you said it yourself lin
i shouldnt hold on to the past
the door starts to shut
she hits the top of a lighter duct taped to the hose
a line of pressurized fire blows into the elevator
sebastian goes up in flame
linda runs toward the elevator
just as the doors about to close she slides
her foot jamming into it
she lets loose with the flame again
sebastian backed into the corner has no where to go
hes yelling in pain
his latex face bubbles and burns
the surgical scrubs singe black
with no other escape route he dives toward the door
linda looks up to see his flaming body fly over her back into the corridor
linda kills the tank as sebastian continues to burn
the elevator lights flickers and the security panel goes up in a shower of sparks
the elevator dies
linda pulls herself to her feet and turns to see
half of sebastians head melted away his latex facade a gruesome smoke damaged mass
his clothes are half burned revealing large blistering bubbly welts underneath like deformed blackened bubble wrap
sebastian crawls to his feet but linda hits him with another shot of flame
sebastian pulls at his clothes as he crawls around the corner
linda stalks toward him
you wanna see god
ill show you god
linda turns the corner to see a heap of smoldering latex and clothing strewn about the corridor floor
sebastian looking like some ugly creature pushes down the corridor
he throbs with his blackened skin blistering and cracking up and down his body
linda lets loose another jet of flame
its smaller than the first and doesnt quite hit sebastian
linda checks the tanks pressure gauge
it slowly drops
linda follows the blackened horror into the maze of tunnels
but as he pushes along the corridor his burns slowly re absorb themselves
sebastian is no longer visible
a quiet moment in the hallway as linda realizes how vulnerable she is
she looks around for him desperately
but something on the ceiling catches her attention
she blasts it with the last jet of her dying torch
the sprinkler system hit by fire comes to life
water sprays down on the tunnel
sebastian is caught in the downpour his invisible frame outlined by water
it comes toward her the hot skin steaming in the water
he grabs linda and slams her against the wall
his watery hand smashes her across her face
on the floor she looks to see sebastian stalking toward her
she crawls away but he grabs her by her hair pulls her to her feet and slams her against the wall
im gonna find everyone in your family and kill them
she never liked me
i think ill go after her and her little boy first
sebastian smashes her head against a metal post
her head cuts open blood dripping down
sebastian contd i just wanted you to know that before you die
linda collapses to the floor
sebastians foot presses against her neck squeezing it
linda gags for breath
but through the shoot of water that is sebastian we see something also
a watery smudge
matt smashes sebastian with the metal bar
sebastian slams against the corridor wall and sinks down
its taken all his strength to got there
he drops the crowbar and seeks the wall for support he sinks to his knees by linda
thought id save you for a change
he gives her his hand and pulls her up into his arms
matt contd lets got out of here
just as the two turn sebastian rises with the crowbar
he swings it with a yell
matt pushes linda out of the way his arm glancing the blow into a conduit
the conduit splits open and severs electrical wiring
the voltage shoots up the crowbar and into sebastian
as the current pulses through his body sebastian vibrates
his blood vessels yank back to visibility followed by his skeletal structure and major organs
sebastian is slowly electrified
smoke pours off him and he becomes more and more visible
finally he collapses
his body throbbing in and out of visibility
matt and linda stumble away
just outside the lab
linda tries to pry open the sealed doors with the crowbar
but she cant
through the doors porthole she sees a collection of chemicals and the fire raging from the earlier explosion
matt peaks inside
he said it himself
all theyll find is a pile of charred corpses
she sees the centrifuge
the timed counter on its face counts down from a minute
hes rigged the centrifuge
in an enclosed space hell wipe out the whole lab
linda and matt move as fast as they can
they reach the burned out elevator
what the hell are they gonna do
we know the damn thing doesnt work
she swings her crowbar at the ceiling
the maintenance hatch comes down
linda hooks the crowbar onto the hatch lip and pulls herself up
she reaches back down for matt
forget about me
give me your hands
linda grabs matts hands and pulls for all shes worth
she struggles but they both manage to got him through the hatch
the centrifuge springs to life
the centrifuge spins the two dozen vials slowly at first
linda and matt are on top of the elevator
lindas hands search the wall
bar fingers run across the smooth metal surface
from the little light below she can see a maintenance ladder that spans the entire height of the vertical tube
they look up and see it disappear into the darkness
matt starts up rung after rung
linda climbs right behind him
the centrifuge spins faster and faster
the vials are starting to rattle
linda and matt pull themselves up the ladder as quick as they can
im going to pass out
he does through sheer force of will
blood from his wound drips down on lindas face
no telling how much further they have to go in this darkness
light leaks in from the maintenance hatch below
the centrifuges whine has reached a fevered pitch
the vials shake violently
one of the vials shatters
a flash of light
a huge explosion rips through the laboratory
the explosion rips through the lab doors
a massive fireball rolls down the tunnel swallowing everything in its path
one of the phase shifted animals gets caught in the flames
we see its shape briefly before it disappears in a wall of fire
the ladder begins to shake
the entire shaft begins to rumble
linda pushes matt up as they scramble toward safety
the fireball blows into the vent
starts rolling down it also
the explosions rolls toward the open elevator
slamming into it
the elevator flies upward
the rumbling worsens
the two desperately cling to the ladder
they looks down to see
surrounded by flames flying up toward them lifted by the explosions shock waves
the carriage accelerates toward them faster and faster
its loose cables whip around the shaft slapping the walls around the pair
its gonna hit them
linda pulls herself close to the ladder and closes her eyes
shes pressed against matt
it flames right by them
when linda opens her eyes the elevator is hundreds of feet above them and a wall of fire is below them closing in
panicked linda pushes matt up the ladder as she stares down at the rising fire wall
but the fire dissipates before it hits them though a stray tongue of flames reaches up to lick the soles of her feet
they hear a terrifying moan and looks up to see the elevator peaking far above her
it slows to a stop and its coming down
faster and faster
coming back toward them in complete free fall
its emergency brakes clamp down slowing it
metal against metal
one of the brakes shears
the elevator unseats from its tracks slamming against the walls as it tumbles
linda sees that the elevator is out of control and watches as it ping pongs toward them
smashing into the access ladder smashing into the wall
the elevator slows but continues slamming side to side
linda cringes as the elevator crashes into the wall above them
but it jams there stopping
they pull their heads away from wall and look up
the elevator just hangs there suspended
theres a small crawlspace between the elevator and the ladder
before it slips
they begins to climb up again
matt shimmies through the tight hollow and squeezes out the other side followed by linda
she breathes a sigh of relief and just hangs there a moment when
something grabs her
a singed throbbing hand emerges from the darkness gripping at her leg
linda contd its him
she kicks at it and sees a dark dirty face a swirl of dirt grime and smoke with hollow eyes rise up the ladder
sebastian you fuck
get off me
sebastian pulls himself up lindas body
translucent dirty hands paving at the fabric of her clothes
linda tries to climb with this thing on her
but sebastian grabs her around the neck
she begins choking for breath
linda fights to keep her grip on the ladder
she looks down at the ten foot drop to the elevator and then
she lets go
she and sebastian plummet through the smoky haze and slam against the top of the elevator
linda seems to hover a few above the elevator sebastians shadowy outline below her
matt painfully lowers himself down the ladder
but metal groans and the elevator drops another five feet
linda struggles to her feet
a menacing dark figure stalking toward her
linda pushes back from him
sebastian grabs her by the hair and pulls bar over to the ladder
the elevator strains and groans
let go of me
sebastian presses her up against the ladder
presses into her from behind
he has her trapped
his dirty hand reaches out and strokes her hair
remember the day we met
you were wearing a red dress and you were so pretty
now look at you
get off of her
sebastian pulls her hair back and kisses her neck with his filthy dirt smeared mouth and half burned away face
matt contd sebastian stop it
linda and sebastian struggle
matt reaches down to try and grab her help her
you fucked it all up
linda looks at her feet
the last elevator emergency brake grips its cable
she grits her tooth and grabs hold of the ladder
go to hell
linda stamps on the brake release
the elevator tumbles along with sebastian
it slams into the fiery abyss a hundred yards below
linda hangs one hand holding onto the ladder the other holding onto matt
matt pulls her back onto the ladder using all his remaining strength
linda and matt stumble out into the blazing sunshine
emergency crews close from all directions sirens roaring
a trail of smoke drifts higher and higher into the sky
an ambulance pulls up next to them and the paramedics hop out immediately putting a blanket around her and treating matts wounds
linda looks over her shoulder at the traces of the ruin and she sees a shimmer of heat rising from the ground
almost as if something was there
