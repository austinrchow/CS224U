written by stephen susco based on the films ju on ju on and ju on the grudge by takashi shimizu production draft blue revised january fade in on maria late
s asleep in bed
shes breathtakingly beautiful
morning light fills the room
the sound of wind and rippling cloth
maria stirs and opens her eyes
she stretches contentedly
then she frowns
shes alone in the bed
no shes not peter s sits on the edge his back to her
two fresh steaming mugs of coffee sit on a tray near him
are you okay
peter doesnt turn
he slowly stands and walks forward towards an open window
theres something strange about the way he moves stiffly almost jerkily straining his joints and muscles
maria gets out of bed concerned
whats the matter
he pauses at the window
turns his head to look back at her
his eyes are vacant
his face is a blank
then peter slowly leans forward
and falls from the window
maria stands in shock as the sound of screeching tires from outside reaches her ears
then screams of terror from below
aghast she finally manages to numbly walk forward towards the window
we move past her and tilt down to reveal peters body lies in the middle of the street
his head has burst open his body broken and twisted
on the pavement a line of blood appears moving down the center of the screen
as if hitting grooves we cannot see the blood slowly forms the shape of two kanji characters
a translation appears over them the grudge
a blur of movement as hundreds of people stream up from a subway tunnel
most are japanese
were not in kansas
standing in the middle of the rush hour pedestrian traffic is karen s american
she faces upstream looking for someone
the flow threatens to carry her away in a heartbeat
she looks fragile intimidated by the madness
she turns to see her boyfriend doug s american approaching
with a reassuring smile he takes her hand and together they force their way through the throng trying to escape the flow
theyre jostled and crushed by the crowd and doug protectively pulls karen closer
ill never get used to this
maybe we should find a different train station
he abruptly stops right in the middle of traffic still holding karens hand
she turns wondering whats going on
she sees the smile on his lips a moment before he sweeps karen into his arms and kisses her
as if the crowd of businessmen surging around them isnt there at all
its tender and loving and she responds
but then she pulls away shy
a public display of affection is considered rude in japan
theres an opening ahead into a side street
doug and karen deftly slip out of the traffic a a b ext
tokyo street day b and walk hand in hand down the much quieter street away from the crowded thoroughfare
doug smiles as they pass by two japanese high school couples making out on the street corner
he turns to give karen a sarcastic look revisions blue a
but she didnt notice the school kids
shes looking in the other direction at a trickle of smoke wafting up over a nearby fence
doug follows as she walks toward an old temple nestled beneath a skyscraper
a collision of the ancient and modern
the fence surrounds a graveyard adjacent to the temple
we walk past this temple every day karen yeah but ive never seen this before
a japanese man stands before an ornate headstone lighting a bundle of incense and bowing before the grave
its a buddhist ritual
the incense smoke carries the prayers to the spirits of his ancestors to help them remain at peace
she turns as doug grinning lights a cigarette with his zippo flicking it shut and pocketing it
youre like this infinite storehouse of wisdom
im not sure which
its not trivia
its what they believe
and its far better by the way than your little pollution ritual
dougs grin softens to a smile
he doesnt respond
but the way hes looking at karen makes her curious what
he turns away for a moment almost shyly dropping his cigarette and crushing it
finally revisions blue b
i just i like that about you
you seem to be able to remember everything thats really important
a tender moment
he checks his watch
except the time
karen checks her own watch realizing oh crap she grabs his hand and starts to walk quickly
cmon youre gonna be late
campus day c an international college in tokyo
the autumn chill doesnt deter the students from enjoying the beautiful day
karen and doug still holding hands enter the campus
nursing care center day cc karen and doug approach the doors of a nursing care center
she pulls him to the side just as hes stepping under a workmans ladder by the doors
seven years of bad luck
before doug can respond and i might have a vested interest in those years
is that right
doug smiles kissing her romantically
then will i see you tonight
ill call you when i get home
with a flourish doug swings himself back under the ladder
i hate odd numbers
d d through the front doors we see doug kiss karen again
they finally separate and doug walks off
revisions blue a
then karen walks through the doors into a bright atrium like lobby area
she waves hello to the receptionist
leaning against a desk behind reception is karens boss alex s american
hes got a phone to his ear its ringing
an answering machine picks up in japanese
alex mutters and hangs up
then he notices karen
shes started up a staircase in the center of the lobby
she turns and comes back down walking over to alex
are you free this afternoon
i just came by to pick up some books i left here
im not scheduled to work today i know
but are you free
do you have class
shaking her head just a test to study for
alex smiles holding out a file
your wish has been granted
karen takes the file and opens it looking at the first page a picture of an older woman emma is attached
its yokos case but she didnt show up for work this morning and i cant reach her at home
she must be sick or something
and she has the damn house key
studying the file karen squints
whats this phrase
mild dementia with severe lethargy
apparently she sleeps through most of the day
her daughter in law doesnt work so shell probably be there
karen seems unsure
its a big step for her
youre the one whos been bugging me about getting out there on your own
besides its an english only house
one of alexs co workers appears in the doorway motioning to him
alex quickly hands karen a card heres the address
use the wall chart if you need help and dont forget to bring a map
karen looks at the address a string of thirty numbers and japanese characters
she glances up at the wall chart a color coded diagram shows how the long address string is broken down into postal code prefecture city ward district block sub block
and house number
dont worry karen youre ready
but shes not quite as confident
rail station day a people rush madly around karen as she studies a large map on the wall
its the tokyo rail system daunting at best
b b bb int
train day bb karen sits uncomfortably on the crowded transit car squeezed in tightly by the people around her
the loud crying of a baby adds to her discomfort
the transit car pulls to a stop and a handful of people get out
karen is one of them shouldering her backpack
a a karen walks down the populated sidewalk weaving through street vendors and passing a large grocery store
she pauses looking at the address on her card
she approaches a woman and her daughter and speaks to them in japanese
the woman nods pointing towards a small alley
karen gives the daughter a smile the girl hides behind her mothers leg
revisions blue a
karen exits the alley entering a quiet narrow street
shes still not sure if shes in the right place
but then her eyes fix on something
she begins to walk towards it her gaze never leaving it a ext
the house day a its the house
cozy and shaded nestled into the dead end of the street
large by tokyo standards
she double checks the address and opens the gate walking around a bicycle leaning against the wall and following the stepping stone path to the front door
she tries again
then an afterthought she tries the handle
karen pokes her head inside the genkan entry hall
she tentatively steps inside and the door closes behind her
its dark and musty the blinds are drawn
is anyone here
she turns and locks the front door
karen stands in the doorway surveying the room
the place is in a complete state of disarray
a scraping sound grabs karens attention
her pov at the far end of the room a frosted glass paneled door leads to an adjacent room
a hand is visible on the other side clawing at the glass
karen runs over and slides open the door revealing a int
tatami room day a emma s american
the older woman in the picture from karens file
shes lying on her stomach on a stained mattress feebly looking up at karen
oh my god
are you alright
karen immediately kneels down next to the infirm woman helping her sit up
emma looks dazed and disoriented
karens eyes sweep the room
it reeks of neglect
emma sits on the back porch staring vacantly
but her expression isnt simply blank theres an odd sadness there
revisions blue a
karen is washing the dirty sheets in a bucket and hanging them to dry
she finishes turning to her charge
lets try again my name is karen
do you remember
im from the health center
im substituting for yoko just for today
emma doesnt respond and theres no indication that she remembers karen introducing herself before
kneeling in front of emma karen notices a band aid around one of her fingers
blood has soaked through it
looks like you need a new band aid
howd this happen emma
still no reaction would you like a bath
maybe that will help you feel better
emma doesnt even turn towards her
karen turns on the water puts the stopper over the drain
karen supports emmas weight as she leads the old woman slowly down the hallway to the bathroom entrance emma stops at the doorway
eyes fixed on the tub
its okay emma
she takes emmas hand and walks inside
but emma doesnt budge
her free hand tightly clutches the door frame
her eyes are wide
staring at the bathtub
karen uses a sponge to bathe emma her robe rolled to her waist
emma stares absently at the sky
revisions blue a
with emma back in bed karen steps out of the back room and slides the door shut
leans against it for a moment
a tough first day on the job
karen has straightened up the room and is vacuuming the floor
something under the couch catches in the vacuum intake jamming it
she turns off the vacuum and feels underneath pulling out a crumpled photo ripped into pieces compressed in a ball
karen sits at the kitchen table flattening and taping together the pieces of the photograph
on the photo a grinning japanese boy holds a cute black cat
his mother and father stand beside him
theyre all beaming at the camera a perfect happy family
but theres a piece missing
the mothers face
karen walks back into the living room
she looks underneath the couch for the missing piece
cant see anything
she lays down and sticks her arm under the couch feeling around
karen sticks her arm in deeper to the shoulder straining
she suddenly jerks her arm back wincing
she has a small cut on her finger
karen looks under the couch for what cut her a small furniture nail sticks out underneath
nice one karen
she gets to her feet folding up the incomplete picture and stuffing it into her pocket
karen steps into the foyer with the vacuum cleaner
she looks up at a railing overhead
some trash is visible sticking over the edge
karen shakes her head how did you get up there
she gathers up the vacuum and heads up to the second floor hallway
theres a nearby door closed the front room and an open door at the end the rear room
as she looks for an outlet she hears a scratching sound
karen stands there for a moment listening
then she walks towards the open door at the end of the hall
karen steps inside
moving boxes are stacked against the wall next to a desk
its an unfinished room
nothing unusual here
except karen notices a lone object sitting on an otherwise empty shelf
its a black ceramic cat
facing the wall
and then karen hears the scratching sound again
karen steps into the hallway and listens
there it is again and this time theres no doubt the sounds are coming from the room by the stairs
karen walks to the door
she pauses disturbed by the eerie sounds from inside
then she reaches for the doorknob
the strange rhythmic thudding continues coming from beyond the door
karen takes a breath
and turns the doorknob
the sounds immediately stop as karen enters the master bedroom
its dark thick blinds covering the windows
a frosted window overlooking the foyer isnt helping much
she stands there for a moment listening
then revisions blue
startled she gasps and turns towards the closed closet doors
thats where the sound is coming from
and then she notices something strange about the closet door its been sealed shut with duct tape
the scratching quickens as if sensing a presence nearby
and then theres a muffled meow
theres a cat in there
karen pulls off the duct tape
she reaches for the door handle slowly sliding it open a crack and peering inside the closet seems empty except for a large book on a shelf
karen reaches inside and picks it up
then she sees in the darkened far corner of the closet a small black cat
its sitting on something watching her
karen slides the door the rest of the way open revealing a young japanese boy age sitting in the corner staring at karen
the cat is curled up on his lap
startled karen drops the book and falls backwards
karen is on her cell phone yes he was shut in a closet
there was tape around the no theyre not home yet
i dont know emma hasnt said a word to me hes still upstairs yes im sure hes japanese but yes alright alex
just please get here as soon as you can
karen hangs up putting the phone down on the kitchen table
she leans against the counter exasperated
then her attention turns to the book she found in the closet
karen cant resist
she opens it
the book is a large journal filled with elegant japanese writing
karen flips through it stopping on revisions blue
a handsome young man smiling at the camera
we recognize him
its peter from the opening scene
karen walks to the front door reaching out to unlock it but she pauses realizing something
she reaches into her pocket pulling out the photo she found
it only takes a second to verify the boy in the photo is the one she found in the closet
karen lowers the photo bewildered
then she looks up startled by the boy
hes kneeling on the second floor landing above watching her through the bars of the metal railing
karen takes a step forward forcing a smile
the boy just stares at her
my name is karen
before she can respond ring
the phone in the next room startles her
karen enters the room as the answering machine picks up the voices of a happy couple on the greeting in english konnichiwa
matt and jennifer arent around leave a message
hey guys its susan
matt are you there
susan on machine contd okay well im leaving work now so you can try my cell or just call me at home later
the caller pauses
karen steps closer to the phone base curious listening i just wanted to make sure mom is okay
a bit weird and im just a little worried
karen reluctant but realizing she should pick up reaches for the phone
but the phone base is empty
the cordless is missing
as karen tries to figure out how to answer with the base listen just give me a call when you can okay
too late the caller hangs up
silence returns to the room
but not completely
karen hears the soft sound of whispering from nearby
beyond her we see a pale face kayako pressed against the frosted window of the sliding door of the tatami room
the face pulls away from the glass just before karen turns towards it
but the sound of whispering continues
as she slowly walks to the door we can make out some words ive told them over and over
ive told them over and over
karen listens for a moment then slides the door open
its very dark in the room the lights have been turned off
emma sitting up in bed turns towards karen
emma who were you talking to
thats when karen notices the indentation in the mattress across from where emma is sitting
where someone else would be if the old woman was having a conversation
emma looks up at karen with pleading eyes
i just want her to leave me alone
karen sits down next to her
you should get some rest emma
she helps emma lie back but as the old womans eyes move to the ceiling they suddenly grow wide her mouth opening in fear karen follows her gaze looking up
and she screams falling off the mattress backing away a murky blackness is lowering from the ceiling
formless at first but flowing and shifting
like a figure draped with black silk
drifting down until the shadowy head is only inches from emmas terrified face
and then the head slowly turns rotating towards karen
in the midst of the blackness are two disembodied eyes
filled with an intense rage
focused directly on karen
off karens nerve shattering scream we
matthew and his wife jennifer are in bed
he sleeps soundly she doesnt
shes staring at the ceiling listening to sounds coming in through the open bedroom door
someone moving downstairs fumbling around bumping into things
jennifer frustrated lets out a sigh
matthew comes downstairs dressed in a business suit
he pauses to pick up some of the rubbish on the stairs
jennifer watches the last drops of coffee fall into the pot
she pours herself a mug takes a big sip
matthew enters surprised to see her
matthew glances into the back room through another sliding door the windows on this one are clear not frosted like the living room
his pov emma is asleep on her mattress
i wonder if moms okay
shes been sleeping ever since we got here
not at night
matthew turns to her surprised
i told you matthew you can sleep through anything
matthew comes over kisses her
im sorry sweetheart
it was probably just the move im sure shell get back on schedule
jennifer nods not convinced
you seen my travel mug
i didnt unpack it yet
matthew kneels down next to a pair of moving boxes in the corner kitchen written on the side
he explores it
maybe you should say something to the helper whats her name
maybe theres something she can suggest
he finds his travel mug wrapped in the sports section of an american newspaper
matthew scans it as he fills his mug
i miss seeing this every morning
no response from his wife
he turns to see jennifer looking down at emma through the window
matthew walks over puts an arm around her
i went for a walk yesterday
just to explore
i got lost and couldnt find anyone who could speak english who could help me
i felt so
this will get easier soon for mom for all of us
she turns to him
or else ill tell the company its just not working out and that were going back to the states with or without my old job
they can get someone else to crunch their numbers
this makes jennifer feel better
but until then promise me youll give it a good try okay jen
the door opens and matthew walks outside stopping to look at a familiar bicycle leaning against the house near the door
is this yokos bike
i think so
its been here all night
matthew rolls the bike from the porch to the gate leaning it against the wall where we saw it earlier
he turns back to jennifer giving her a kiss
ill probably be home late maybe around nine or so
jennifer gives him a look
i knew youd forget
matthew pauses looks back blankly
jennifer just smiles
dinner your sister
you were going to cook
i have a big conference
they usually run long
jennifer rolls her eyes
ill do the shopping
just call me if youre going to be late
she goes back inside closes the door
jennifer stands by a cart looking pale under the stark fluorescent lighting
she also looks shell shocked
her pov before her is a wall of japanese products
barely a lick of english on any of the brightly colored packages
jennifer is in a word clueless
she looks around for assistance but shes lost in a whirl of japanese faces
she tentatively reaches towards a bowl shaped package
studies the japanese writing
stealing a glance around her she quietly tears open a corner of the bowl
close on the same package a microwaveable soup bowl now open with a spoon sticking out of it
resting with a glass of water atop the kotatsu table
pan to reveal a pair of feet on the lip of a moving box next to the table
its jennifer asleep on the couch
a clattering sound wakes her followed by the sound of footsteps running away
we pull back as jennifer sees her bowl and the glass next to it have been knocked over
she sits up looking into the tatami room
emma sits on the edge of her mattress staring blankly at her
jennifer gets up sternly walks over
if you need something all you have to do is say so she stops short as she sees
formed from the broth and noodles of her spilled soup
theyre the footprints of a child
and they lead away from the back room down the main hallway
jennifer looks back up to see emma watching her
jennifer follows the damp footprints
theyre getting lighter and cease altogether in the foyer
she stands there for a moment bewildered
then she tenses as if sensing shes being watched
she slowly turns to see a black cat
sitting on the first landing of the stairs
staring at her with bright yellow eyes
as jennifer takes a step towards it two childs hands reach around the corner and pick up the cat pulling it out of view
whos whos there
she walks up the stairs and looks around the corner
she takes a deep breath and starts to climb
reaching the top jennifer catches a glimpse of a familiar boy running into the front room
she slowly walks towards the open door we cant see inside the room from the hallway
but she pauses as she hears thud
the same rhythmic thumping that karen heard
after a moment jennifer steps inside the room disappearing from our sight
we hear her suddenly draw a gasp
as we drift closer to the doorway we notice something strange the room appears to be growing darker
a sharp breathing can be heard from inside
quick panicked gulps of air
just as we reach the doorway the harsh breathing stops
revisions blue a
a moment of stillness
then the door is slammed shut from the inside
matthew enters from work jacket slung over his shoulder
calling out sorry im late it took awhile to wrap things up
he leaves his briefcase by the door and turns to the hall noticing the house is completely dark
matthew turns on the lights
the room has reverted to its messy state even worse than before
he looks down at a picture formerly hanging on the wall now lying on the ground
the glass is broken
what the hell
he quickly goes to the back room
emma sits on the edge of her bed dazed and staring
in the darkness
are you alright
he kneels down next to her
wheres jennifer mom
he surveys the mess in the room
angrily did yoko come today mom
the pretty girl
he gets to his feet looking at the spilled soup in the living room now hardened and crusty
over the railing matthew re enters the foyer looking up
are you up there
he climbs up the stairs walking to matthew stands in the doorway of the dark room
he tries the light switch
he slowly enters feeling his way through the room
we can barely make him out in the darkness
we see the shape of the bed by a window
matthew feels his way to a table next to the bed
switches on a small lamp jennifer is right next to him
lying in bed staring wide eyed at the ceiling
matthew startled falls backwards
what is it matthew rushes to her shaking her
the only sign shes alive is that her fearful eyes slowly fix on him
her mouth opens as if shes trying to speak
she tries harder to form words but can only produce a croak
ill call an ambulance
matthew runs into the kitchen grabbing a large book on one of the moving boxes
the japanese equivalent of a yellow pages
he whips it open hardly a word of english in it
a stack of books sit on the very top of a tall bookshelf
scissors and a roll of duct tape rest atop them
matthew pushes everything aside to get at a japanese english dictionary underneath
the duct tape falls to the floor
he tears across the room to the phone base but the cordless phone is missing
matthew re enters out of breath
he sits next to jennifer who hasnt moved
puts a hand on her chest to make sure shes still breathing
he looks through the dictionary finding the word he needs ambulance
then he quickly rips open the yellow pages seeing in plain english emergency on the first page
below that fire ambulance dial
he drops the book and reaches across the bed for a phone on a table at the far side the boy toshio stands up between matthew and the phone
but he looks different from before his skin is discolored his lips and eyes are ringed and sullen
who are you
what what are you doing here
toshio makes a strange sound
looks at jennifer then turns to matthew snarling at him like a cat
matthew shocked falls backwards off the bed hitting the table with the lamp
it drops to the ground revisions blue
and toshios shadow cast by the fallen light begins to stretch and grow across the ceiling
the shadow creeps over jennifer shifting and coming towards matthew matthew grabs the lamp
he reaches it holding it up at first it looks like both jennifer and toshio have disappeared
but then jennifer suddenly back on the bed sits upright jerkily as if shes been yanked up and forward
her mouth is wide and gasping and then she falls back onto the bed
matthew stunned backs away from the bed against the closet
terrified he doesnt notice the thud thud sound growing around him
then toshios head comes into frame behind him
matthew hears a growling sound and turns seeing toshio right there
the doorbell rings
then a few more times
susan american late s enters with two bottles of wine
she kicks off her shoes
you guys in the kitchen
susan walks in puts the wine on the table
calling out i thought you guys were gonna cook
she goes into the back room
sits next to emma
how are you feeling
emma turns to her with her usual vacant look
revisions blue a
theres a creak from above
susan looks up at the ceiling
i guess i came at a bad time huh
twisting a corkscrew into a wine bottle susan leans into the foyer yelling upstairs ill give you guys one minute to finish whatever youre doing up there and get your
butts down here
as she heads back towards the kitchen we crane up to see matthew
hes walking down the second floor hall
he looks different the expression on his face is troubled occupied
and hes dragging his dead wifes body
by the hair
he pulls her inside the rear room the doorway looks more imposing more ominous than before
its dark and malevolent the threshold to a secret that wont stay buried
we crane back down to see susan in the kitchen
shes poured a glass of wine and sighs impatiently
she walks back down the hall into the foyer
i mean it guys
silence from upstairs
shaking her head well i warned you
prepare to be emotionally scarred
she starts up the stairs and turns the first corner matthew is sitting there hands on his knees looking harried
dont scare me like that
hes shaking slightly
his eyes drift up to hers
whats going on
she went out
something came up
i hope shes not long
im absolutely starving
matthew looks back down at his feet
susan misreads i knew it
you guys forgot to go shopping didnt you
matthew abruptly stands
looming over his sister
this is a bad time
are you okay
whats going on
you should go
he moves forward right into her
his momentum pushes susan back into the foyer
she holds onto his shirt did something happen
whats matthews hands suddenly tighten on her shoulders
his eyes grow wide filled with anger as he whispers fiercely she doesnt love me
she never loved me
susan watches as he repeats himself over and over
growing scared she finally shakes him
what are you talking about
matthew slowly looks up
malice on his face
he steps forward
susan backs away
stop it matthew
leave me alone
matthew please yelling susan fumbles with the front door
she gets it open and runs out just before matthew reaches her
on matthew he stands there head tilted down for a moment
then he straightens
slowly closes the front door
matthew heads back upstairs
he reaches the second floor and opens the door to the rear bedroom
the room beyond is dark
but a dark figure is visible standing in the far corner facing matthew
he steps inside and the door slowly swings shut behind him
its an overcast afternoon
swollen clouds hang low over the house
it looks a bit more imposing than usual
the mailbox is adorned with the japanese equivalent of a for sale sign weather worn and looks like its been there for years
suzuki s japanese a real estate agent waits by the gate
then he notices something
waves and smiles
its susan approaching with matthew jennifer and emma
susan shakes suzukis hand and they exchange a greeting in japanese
she turns to her brother
this is suzuki san hes the real estate broker
suzuki bows at matthew and jennifer says something
what did he say
he said welcome to tokyo
and that you must be very important to your company for them to rent this place for you
susan rolls her eyes
everyone enters checking the place out
suzuki and susan slip off their shoes
as matthew steps into the foyer your shoes
he kneels down untying his shoes
jennifer looks perplexed
even in our own house
even in your own house
suzuki smiles as matthew and jennifer take off their shoes
susan says something to him in japanese and he laughs
they walk down the hall and matthew and jennifer follow
suzuki opens the blinds letting some light into the place
its not helping much its still pretty dreary
isnt the layout great
wait till you see the back room
its perfect for mom she wont have to deal with the stairs
jennifer follows him through the room
she doesnt look quite as enthusiastic
matthew slides open the door leading to the tatami room
her bed wont be here until next week but we can put the mattress on the floor
what do you think
jennifer warms a bit
the wooden room is beautiful
susan asks suzuki a question in japanese and he responds
he says no one has lived in this house for three years
susan asks suzuki in japanese
trying his english ex pen sive
matthew suddenly realizes wheres mom
we slowly crane up to the second floor hall moving towards the rear room at the end
the door is ajar
a a susan comes up the stairs worried
where are you
the house front room day b susan looks inside emma isnt there
shes about to leave when something catches her attention
she walks to the closet
the door is open
susan kneels down looking at something inside it
she picks it up its the ceramic cat karen found earlier
as susan examines it she notices something on the wall of the closet which we dont see
her face softens and she smiles
did you get her
under her breath take a pill will ya
susan stands and walks out of the room
but we stay in the closet panning to reveal the closet wall
its covered with black crayon low to the ground the work of a child
the images are dozens of black cats
revisions blue a
emma stands in the dead center of the empty bedroom
looking directly up at the ceiling
susan enters placing the ceramic cat on the shelf where karen found it earlier
except susan faces it into the room
you know what the doctor said about stairs
she takes emmas hand but the old woman doesnt move
matthew and jennifer enter worried
what is it
everyone follows her gaze to the ceiling
only emma has the unmistakable look of dread on her face
a long beat
suzuki walks from the kitchen into the hallway giving the place one final look over
he pauses by the open bathroom door
suzuki enters looking at the tub filled to the brim
after a moment suzuki kneels down next to the bathtub
he pulls the thin chain connected to the rubber stopper but the end of the chain comes out of the water
its not connected after all
suzuki eyes the plug at the bottom of the tub
then he takes off his jacket
rolls up his shirt sleeve
and reaches into the water for the rubber stopper
its just out of reach
he rolls up his sleeve a little more
reaches deeper suddenly theres a burst of sound a dull thumping something thrashing in water the screaming of a young boy voice muffled by water suzuki recoils as water splashes
up around him he falls away from the tub in horror landing on his butt
the bathtub filled to the brim
still and silent
not so much as a ripple on the surface
that couldnt have just been his imagination could it
as he slowly stands he sees something out of the corner of his eye a dead cat bloody and torn in the corner of the room
revisions blue a
as suzuki backs away from it eyes widening in horror hes startled by matthew standing in the doorway
beaming at him
well take it
suzuki looks back to the corner
theres no dead cat
a ringing sound comes into focus the beeping of a phone waiting for someone to pick up and make the connection
a omitted a revisions blue
b omitted b c omitted c its after hours in this office space cubicles fill the center surrounded by glass windowed offices
the glittering lights of the tokyo cityscape beyond show a hell of a view
one light still burns in an office towards the end susans office
shes working late
she wears a phone headset while she types lines of code into her computer
no ones answering
a familiar answering machine picks up konnichiwa
matt and jennifer arent around leave a message
hey guys its susan
matt are you there
okay well im leaving work now so you can try my cell or just call me at home later
leans back away from the keyboard
i just wanted to make sure mom is okay
susan into phone contd a bit weird and im just a little worried
listen just give me a call when you can okay
she hangs up taking the headset off
susan walks through the hallway
she hears a strange scraping sound it sounds as though something is being dragged
susan turns around but the hallway looks normal
is it just her imagination
the sound starts again coming closer
susan gets scared and opens the door to the emergency stairwell beside her
a a the hallway is chilly susan shivers
shes about to start walking down when she looks up noticing the lights at the top floor flickering
a wind suddenly blows through the center of the stairwell with an eerie roar
susan looks disconcerted as she starts walking down
then we hear the scraping sound again
startled susan pauses and looks down over the railing
theres nothing there but the sound continues growing louder like something is moving up towards her
calling out is anybody there
just then the lights on the top floor finally go out
susans breath catches in her throat as she looks up the lights on the next floor go out
and the next
the darkness above growing closer with each darkening floor
susan nervously looks back down the scraping is even closer
and then for an instant she sees a skinny pale hand on the railing two floors down
terrified susan starts to back up but stops as she realizes that the darkness from above is almost upon her
revisions blue a
then susan sees a fingertip of the hand at the corner of the floor where she stands and a head covered with black hair slowly crawling up on the wall
susans mouth opens in a silent screen
with nowhere to escape she opens the same door and rushes back into the hallway b omitted b revisions blue
c omitted c cc int
office building th floor hall night cc but her lucky rabbits foot gets caught on the door latch
panicking susan struggles to free herself through the crack she sees the darkness continuing to come down
the lights on susans floor flicker
susan looks up to see a pale boy on the landing to the higher floor
the same boy is also standing on the landing of each floor above
theyre all staring down at susan
susan screams as she desperately tries to yank her chain free
and then she sees the pale hand clutching her rabbits foot
the door shuts and susan falls backwards into the hallway
she jumps to her feet and runs down the hall
a omitted a a cramped room
susan stands in the doorway animatedly talking to a young security guard sitting at a desk lined with video monitors
shes speaking rapidly and shaking in the stairs
a strange person
all the lights were going out
the guard doesnt understand her in her panic susans mispronouncing her words and she knows it
susan takes a breath frustrated and frightened
pleading in english please
the guard stands placing a reassuring hand on her shoulder
ill take a look
the guard leaves
susan doesnt look thrilled to be alone
a a aa aa ab int
th floor hall night ab holding a flashlight the guard walks down the hallway checking the doors
office building security room night b susan takes a breath and sits down trying to relax
its obvious that she feels safer here in the security room
then she notices movement on one of the security monitors on the screen the guard continues down the th floor hall stopping at the door to the stairwell
susan leans toward the monitor for a better view
on the screen the guard opens the stairwell door and leans inside checking it out
on susan her eyes are glued to the screen
on the screen the guard finding nothing out of the ordinary closes the door and continues on down the hall
susan leans back exhaling
then the video crackles with a sudden quick burst of static
and susan gasps sitting upright as she sees on the screen the stairwell door opens again
and then something dark moves out of the stairwell entering the hallway
on susan she recoils from the screen in horror unable to tear her gaze away
her mouth opens in a silent scream her eyes widening as she watches and then she finds the strength to get to her feet
susan bursts out of the security room and runs through the empty lobby towards the front doors
office building night a susan rushes out of the front doors and runs to the street
she frantically hails a cab and gets in
revisions blue a
taxi night b susan presses herself in the corner of the back seat purse clutched tightly in her white knuckles
a shifting wash of colors flood the taxi the neon lights of the surrounding buildings tower above threatening to swallow her whole
susan rushes through the front doors clutching her purse strap with both hands
shaken just wanting to get home
she runs to the elevator and jabs the button for her floor
susan tries to regain her composure as the elevator rises
she closes her eyes and leans against the wall not noticing a familiar pale japanese boy looking at her through the window of every floor she passes toshio
hes standing closer to the window with each floor
until finally hes right next to the glass the elevator stops at her floor no little boy this time
susan gets out of the elevator moving quickly to her apartment at the end of the hall
she chances a look over her shoulder as she puts the key in her lock
then she goes in and closes the door
she takes a long deep breath
safe at home
she sits at her kitchen table laying her purse down
her eyes go to the broken chain still hanging from the strap with some rabbits foot fur lodged in the links
susans home phone rings and she jumps
she stares at it for a moment then tentatively answers hello
revisions blue a
theres something strange about his voice its oddly flat without inflection
are you alright
what number are you again
ill buzz you in
she presses a button on the phone and is about to hang up almost immediately theres a loud knock at her door
she gets to her feet surprised
how did he get up so fast
susan goes to the door and looks through the peephole
her pov matthews face distorted by the fish eye glass
hes looking into the peephole with a sneer on his face
susan opens the door
i dont know what youre up to but this is not cool she catches her breath
theres no one there
then the phone emits the throaty croaking sound
quickly growing louder and louder
susan cries out and drops the phone
it breaks open on the hallway floor as susan slams her apartment door
susan quickly draws the chain lock
then she builds the courage to step forward and look through the peephole her pov the phone lies broken in the middle of the floor
otherwise the hallway is empty
susan backs away from the door shaking in fright
breathing hard she backs into revisions blue
susan enters turning off her cell phone and unplugging the bedroom phone from the wall
then she retreats to the safety of her bed eyes on the apartment door next to the kitchen
susans breathing slows
but she looks around the room still anxious its too quiet in here
her panic builds
but shes alone in the room isnt she
as we move in on susan the room starts to become quieter
the sound of traffic from outside the humming refrigerator in the kitchen
everything fades to a stifling silence
and susan notices all right
her breath now suddenly loud catches in her throat
a long moment of silence
then its coming from the kitchen sink
susan stares at it
she finally stands and a a slowly walks into the kitchen
she reaches out and turns the faucet handle
the dripping stops
relieved susan turns away drip
it begins again
louder more intense
scared susan turns back to the sink
water is now gushing out from the faucet filling up a bowl in the sink
she slowly reaches out a hand and turns the faucet as tightly as she can manage tighter
straining with the effort
until the water stops
only then does she let go just then a childs pale hand quietly rises to the surface from water in the bowl and starts violently splashing the surface
revisions blue a
susan screams and runs back to her bedroom b int
susans apartment bedroom night b she lies down shivering pulling the quilt to her chin
a final retreat
the splashing sounds in the kitchen continue for a while
then it suddenly stops
susan is so terrified that she almost faints
then her breathing stops
her eyes widen
her hand reaches up under her pillow feeling around and she comes out with her lucky rabbits foot
the one she left behind in the stairwell
susan suddenly cries out her head tilting back her body abruptly going stiff
we soon see why a lump begins to rise at the foot of the bed
a big one
moving slowly up susans body
reaching the edge of the quilt which slowly rises revealing a quick flash of the pale face of the japanese woman with long dark hair on top of her
susan screams and is abruptly pulled under the covers revisions blue
dark and still
lying in wait
completely silent except someones knocking on the front door
theyre still knocking
apparently whoevers knocking isnt going to give up the door handle jiggles
but its locked
karens cell phone lays on the table in the foreground
beyond is the hallway and the front door
the knocking has stopped
then karens cell phone suddenly lights up ringing
it rings four times then goes to voice mail
a new sound breaks the silence movement outside
crunching footsteps on gravel someone brushing past tree limbs
a shadow falls over the window
a face looks inside its alex karens boss
he walks away from the window and continues down the side of the house we track down the hallway past the bathroom through the kitchen following his progress into the
back room alex is visible through the sliding door leading to the back porch
he peers inside
his pov a figure covered head to toe in a white sheet lies on the mattress
alex tries the sliding door its open
he steps inside
silence greets him
he stares down at the figure in the bed
alex licks his lips nervous
finally walks to the mattress kneeling down next to it
raises a hand and grabs the sheet
raises it over the head its emma
as we last saw her eyes on the ceiling mouth and eyes wide open in fear
but now its clear from the tache noire in the eyes the blanched skin the rigidity of her body shes dead
alex falls back onto his butt staring at emma
he pulls himself away from the corpse and freezes
theres something right behind him
he whirls around its karen
in the corner looking pale and dazed
two police cars and an ambulance are parked out front
an unmarked car pulls up and detective nakagawa s exits the passenger side
he looks up at the house with dread
the driver detective igarashi s moves next to him
i can handle this myself you know
its just a routine call
i dont know why you wanted to come
he turns to nakagawa awaiting a response
he doesnt get one
nakagawa just stares up at the house
the house feels completely different all the interior lights are on a few police officers mill about two emts wheel emmas body out the front door on a gurney
alex sits at the kitchen table frazzled
he turns to karen
shes sitting in the living room wrapped in a blanket being attended to by a female nurse and speaking with nakagawa and igarashi who is taking notes on a pad
karen says something and the detective looks over at alex
then he speaks to the nurse who helps karen to her feet
nakagawa and igarashi enter the kitchen
in perfect english i am detective nakagawa
this is detective igarashi my assistant
is karen okay
she is very shaken
we would like her to stay in the hospital tonight under evaluation
he hands alex a wedding picture of matthew and jennifer
do you know these people
matthew williams and his wife jennifer
hes emmas son the woman karen came here to see
when was the last time you saw him
i met them when they came to register
its standard procedure though the visits were arranged by his employer
he works at weve spoken with his employer
he did not show up for work today
something about this gives alex pause
nakagawa speaks briefly to igarashi in japanese then hands alex a card
if you could please come by tomorrow to make a statement the address is there at the bottom realizing yoko
karen was a substitute yoko is the girl who is normally in charge of emma
shes also been missing from work
for how long
revisions blue aa
for the last two days
nakagawa and igarashi exchange a look
i think i saw her bike outside
nakagawa heads for the front door as igarashi continues to interview alex
revisions blue a
nakagawa stands outside by the front gate looking at revisions blue
he looks down at it frowning
then he suddenly cocks his head
as if sensing something
he turns to look up at a window on the second floor
igarashi stands by the answering machine
the message counter reads
he presses play
susans message replays and he listens carefully
as it ends he turns to see nakagawa standing in the doorway
thats matthews sister
he shows nakagawa a photo of matthew and susan brother and sister grinning at the camera
this must be her
the look on nakagawas face is grave
call her at work then at home
if no one answers send someone to he trails off looking down at the phone base
the cordless phone is missing
nakagawa reaches down pressing the locate button
a distant beeping sound can be heard
everyone in the room stops what theyre doing
nakagawa and igarashi enter from the hallway followed by their men
they look up to the second floor
the beeping is definitely coming from upstairs
nakagawa and igarashi come upstairs their men following close behind
they pause in the hallway for a moment
then nakagawa walks into the rear room matthews office
the beeping is close
he stands there in the center of the room listening
then he looks up at the ceiling
everyone follows suit
nakagawa turns to the closed closet doors
he quickly pulls open the door
the closet is empty
nakagawa looks up peering into the darkness
his pov the attic panel yawns wide open
and right next to it are four long grooves in the ceiling
as if something was dragged across it right to the edge
something like fingernails
nakagawa leans out looking at igarashi
i need your flashlight
a shaft of light from the flashlight through the open attic access cuts through the thick darkness
nakagawa appears pulling himself up into the attic
he swings his flashlight slowly around the room
igarashi comes up next to nakagawa just as the detectives flashlight stops on something
a beat as they exchange an uneasy look
then nakagawa and igarashi crawl through the darkness towards the far corner of the space
two bodies are tucked into the corner
matthew and jennifer
nakagawa sits in front of the bodies examining them
what the hell
what is going on
nakagawa sees the beeping cordless phone a few feet away
something next to it attracts nakagawas interest
we cant see what it is but theres some deep red in it and something very white what is that
nakagawas eyes widen as he realizes what hes looking at
the police cars outside have attracted a small crowd
the two bodies are being loaded into a police van
nakagawa stands with the coroner
the coroners assistant wearing a face mask and rubber gloves approaches
he holds something small wrapped in a bloody white sheet
the coroner slowly unfolds the sheet
we cant see what hes looking at but it elicits quite a reaction
who does this belong to
we dont know
the coroner quickly re covers the object
i can use the blood to help identify the person
as the coroner and his assistant walk away is it possible that someone could live without
the coroner turns back his face pale
revisions blue a
i certainly hope not
nakagawa turns away to see igarashi approaching talking into a cell phone
he looks disturbed
as he hangs up someone just reported another death
its not in our district
but i think we should check it out
nakagawa realizes somethings troubling his partner
the cause of death is not clear
but it is the man who sold them this house
close on the spinning wheels of a bicycle
a familiar one
the pedals are being pumped by a beautiful young japanese woman this is yoko early s
yoko turns riding down a small side street
it ends and she rounds a corner stopping in front of a ext
the house day a yoko opens the gate and walks her bike to the front door leaning it against the wall nearby exactly where we saw matthew bump into it
she rings the door buzzer
she seems to have expected this she pulls a key from her pocket with a plastic label on it
yoko steps inside
she instinctively slips off her shoes
she calls out in decent english hi excuse me
theres a small envelope with yokos name resting on a small table by the door
she takes it opens it
revisions blue a
the letter says simply out for a walk back later
im coming in
the house is the least moved into that weve seen so far although the main furniture is in place moving boxes are stacked in every room in various stages of
but theres also an unusual amount of mess in the house a disarray much like the opening sequence that isnt exactly related to moving in
yoko surveys the room dismayed by the mess
then she sees emma at the far end of the living room her back to yoko
shes looking down at something in her hands
its good to see you again
looks blankly at yoko who approaches
realizing the woman doesnt remember her my name is yoko
the old woman still gives no sign of recognition
yoko gently takes her arm
you should be in bed then she sees what emma was looking at the roll of duct tape
shes cut her finger on the serrated cutting blade
you shouldnt be playing with this
shaking her head yoko takes the duct tape and looks around for a place where emma cant get at it she puts the tape on the stack of books at
the top of the bookshelf next to the scissors where matthew found them
the house entrance day a from the entrance we see yoko come out of the kitchen holding a tray with a teapot and cup
she walks into the back room looking down at emmas bed
the old woman must be asleep yoko gently lays down the tray quietly steps out of the room and slides the door shut
then yoko moves through the living room to the phone base she picks up the cordless finally where it belongs
yoko dials a number as she walks into the entrance hall
she begins a conversation in japanese as she looks at the scattered rubbish on the ground shaking her head
she climbs up to the second floor pausing to kneel and pick up some pieces of crumpled paper chatting all the while
yoko pauses turning towards the open door to the front room
the rhythmic thumping continues
the room is a mess
the bed is unmade clothes are strewn on the floor
looks like a storm swept through it
yoko stands in the doorway listening for the thumping sounds
but theyve stopped
she finishes her call and hangs up
she sticks the cordless phone into her pocket and starts to clean the room
as yoko straightens the bedspread she hears something
and we hear it too a familiar throaty croaking sound
quiet and muffled
yoko a bit unnerved by the strange sound pulls a small mp player and headphones from her pocket
she puts them on and goes back to work
the house second floor hallway day aa yoko backs into the hallway humming along to the music
preoccupied she doesnt notice as the door to the rear room at the end of the dark hall behind her slowly swings open
yoko turns and walks down the hall towards it
the house rear room day a yoko enters the room which is also a mess
the moving boxes are tumbled about the small room
then she notices the ceramic cat on the shelf facing her where susan left it
apparently shes not a big fan of felines she uneasily turns it to face the wall instead
yoko turns back to the room staring to stack the moving boxes the way we saw them before
as she does she pauses again
the music in her headphones starts phasing digital noise creeping in
yoko takes off the headphones
stares at them
and then theres another croaking sound
from close by
yoko draws a breath quickly looking up at the ceiling directly above her
thats where the horrible sound is coming from
freaked out yoko backs away and opens the bedroom door the hallway is completely dark
an unnatural blackness
the skylights above which were previously filled with sunlight are now completely opaque
yoko stands in the doorway scared afraid to step into the darkness
then she looks down revisions blue a
her pov the murky blackness of the hall seems to be slowly creeping in phantomlike around the edges of the door
yoko stumbles back into the room
her eyes fixed on the doorway the creeping darkness is now coming in around all sides not just the bottom
yoko backs up to the bed still clutching the cordless phone
she looks back at the door suddenly crying out revisions blue
a black cat sits in the doorway
tail wrapped around itself sitting perfectly still like a statue
staring at yoko with its yellow eyes
something unnatural about it
yoko backs away towards the closet
nowhere to go
the cat suddenly hisses at her and thats all yoko can take
in a panic she opens the closet door ducks inside
yoko slams the door shut pulling herself up onto a raised shelf
breathing hard looking down at the crack under the door
the light is beginning to dim
yoko presses back into the closet trapped
the closet is starting to get dark
yoko looks around desperately
looking up she sees the attic panel above her is wide open
caught between a rock and a hard place
yoko decides she shakily stands on the shelf and reaches up to pull herself into the attic
yokos head appears
then her shoulders
she looks around but cant see a thing in the darkness
shes about to pull herself all the way up when she hears the throaty croaking sound
coming from the darkness
yoko stiffens her breath catching in her throat
another pov were at the far end of the attic suddenly and rapidly racing forward towards yoko
on yoko something brushes her face
long black hair
theres a head just inches from hers
almost nose to nose
yoko is paralyzed with fear eyes wide
a long beat
then she reaches into her pocket pulling out a lighter
yoko raises it and flicks the wheel we get a glimpse of a pale face surrounded by long black hair eyes wide and mouth open the throaty sound suddenly increasing
in pitch and volume as the face moves forward karen slowly wakes up in bed
as her eyes clear she sees doug
he sits on the edge of the bed slightly slumped his back to her
he slowly turns and a relieved smile crosses his face
he moves closer and reaches out a hand
ive got you
karen nods lacing her fingers in his
but her eyes are glazed and unfocused shes exhausted
your boss told me what happened
she turns away the memory bothering her
doug takes her hand massaging her fingers worried
i talked to your teachers
they said you can take as much time as you need
we could go to kyoto for a weekend see those temples youre always talking about
karen tries to smile back but her hearts not in it
running away wont help
revisions blue aa
theres nothing to run away from kat
no one blames you for what happened
revisions blue a
im not even sure what did happen
you went to help someone who was quite simply beyond help
no thats not what i mean
she trails off trying to remember
there was something
doug sees her frustration and tenderly brushes a hair from her face
dont beat yourself up searching for a greater truth kat
an old woman passed away in her sleep
its sad but thats all it is is that how they said she died
im sorry this happened to you
but maybe in a way it will help you later
death is an unfortunate but integral part of your future career
theres no avoiding it
maybe now youll be more
ready for it
i dont think ill ever be ready for something like that
she turns away
doug wraps an arm around her
karen leans into him and he strokes her hair
the moment is broken by a soft knock
detective nakagawa stands in the doorway holding a thick file
im sorry to disturb you miss davies
i was wondering if you could answer some additional questions
doug stands intercepting nakagawa
he sticks out a hand
fixes doug with a blank stare
taking the hint doug turns to karen
you up for this
nodding why dont you find out when i can check out of here
reluctantly doug kisses her brow then exits
nakagawa pulls a chair up to the bed and sits putting the file on a small table
how are you feeling
you are an exchange student
karen nods and you have been volunteering at the health center for
i needed a social welfare credit
you said this was the first time youd been in that house
she notices nakagawa isnt taking notes
he seems somewhat uncomfortable as if hes building to something about the japanese boy you said you saw there did you find him
no not yet
you said the boy had been taped into the closet
yes thats right
holding a cat
a black cat
remembering there was a book in the closet too
i think it was a journal
did it belong to the boy
revisions blue aa
i dont think so
i think it belonged to a woman
revisions blue a
nakagawa looks up
karen tries to explain the writing
it looked feminine
i left it on the kitchen table
nakagawa frowns scribbles a note
i didnt see any book on the table
perhaps someone moved it
did you speak with the boy after you opened the closet
she thinks recalling i asked him his name
he said toshio
nakagawa immediately tenses
a long beat
he can see how exhausted karen is
but somethings troubling him one more question please
he slowly reaches into his pocket and pulls out the photo karen found and taped together
he shows it to her
we found this in the room where
karen looks at the picture
this is him
this is the boy
are you certain
nakagawa stares down at the picture in his hands
and karen notices nakagawas hands are shaking
he looks up at her a faraway look in his eyes
the whole time i was in that house i felt something was
revisions blue a
from the expression on nakagawas face shes onto something
what happened there
nakagawa holds karens gaze for a moment
even in her exhausted state its clear shes as frightened as he is
the bodies of the son and daughter in law of the woman you were caring for were found in the attic
karen just stares at him stunned
it seems that the son killed his wife and then himself theres a knock on the door
igarashi stands in the doorway
he speaks to nakagawa in japanese
to karen please excuse me for a moment
nakagawa puts the photo down and steps into the hallway and closes the door but not all the way
karen watches and listens through the crack in the hallway the men speak with hushed voices
we checked the apartment of susan the sister
she wasnt there
he trails off hesitating
the chain lock had been drawn from the inside
and the deadbolt
but we found no one in the apartment
nakagawa takes this in
get the surveillance tapes from the office building
but doesnt move
after a moment quietly they were the first family to live in that house since the incident three years ago revisions blue
nakagawas harsh look silences him
then the detective turns noticing karen watching them
he pulls the door shut
nakagawas stern voice is muffled by the closed door
karen sits back in bed disturbed
then her attention turns to the file on the table
then reaches for it
its a police report in japanese
karen scans it and turns the page
she draws a breath its a photo of the house
cordoned off with police tape
an ambulance out front
like the scene she just left
only the picture is dated three years ago
three detectives are visible beyond the open front door conferring in the entryway
the photo of the house is attached to a police report with three pictures
a stern looking japanese man takeo a somber woman kayako and a young boy we know very well karen makes the connection
she picks up the taped up photo and compares it to the file
the boy and his father are the same as in the newspaper
karen gently touches the missing face of kayako then her eyes move to the picture of the boy
her eyes widen as she reads the japanese text under his face toshio
the place is quiet completely deserted
except for alex
hes behind his desk in the reception area staring off into space
alex finally glances up at a clock its almost ten oclock
he gets up turns off his computer switches off the lights and walks around the reception desk towards revisions blue
the front doors
he hits a final light switch and is almost to the exit when he suddenly slips
saves himself by throwing a hand up against the wall
he looks down
what the hell did he slip on
a pool of liquid
right by the front doors where the ladder stood earlier
its too dark to make out what the fluid is
alex looks down at his hand its covered in the liquid
and theres a dark handprint where he grabbed the wall
his pov a trail of footprints lead from the pool of liquid around the base of the stairs
his eyes on his dirtied hand alex slowly reaches for the nearby light switch
the overheads come on the liquid is deep red
alex looks across the room
shaking he starts to walk forward following the footsteps
he pauses at the bottom of the stairs seeing the blood trail has stopped
right by the bottom step
alex looks up the staircase
after a moment alex starts to walk up
as he reaches the first landing he freezes
sensing something behind him
he turns to see yoko
head lowered clothing is torn and bloody
shes slowly climbing up the steps but shes moving jerkily like a marionette her limbs making a strange creaking as if tendons and muscles are being pushed to their limits
and theres blood dripping down splattering on her shoes
she keeps moving straining climbing
what happened yoko
now she finally stops two steps away
a long beat
say something please
yoko slowly raises her head towards him the lower half of her face is missing
her jawbone has been ripped out her tongue hanging limply on her chest
alex stumbles backwards
and his foot lands right in a puddle of blood
his legs fly out from under him and he his pov everything goes blurry and canted degrees
but it looks like theres a figure standing in the hallway watching the scene
a small boy holding a black cat
dazed alex plants a hand on the ground and pulls himself into a seating position and coming face to face with yoko kneeling down directly in front of him
her bloody tongue dripping lolling
on alex eyes wide he opens his mouth to scream nakagawa sits at the desk
exhausted dark circles under his eyes hes staring down at the file on his desk
as if hes afraid to even open it
but he does
he flips through the photos pausing on that of toshio but continuing on to the black and white photo of the house from three years ago the one karen saw
with the nakagawa turns to a framed picture on his desk its younger nakagawa at a bar with three familiar detectives
theyre off duty grinning at the camera
the two photographs share the same three detectives
as nakagawa looks at the crime scene photo he realizes something
he slowly stands in shock trembling
the phone rings startling him
nakagawa walks over picks up the phone
his face goes blank
he slowly lowers the phone
the coroner sits on a stool staring at the floor
two bodies lie under bloody white sheets on two steel tables
between them is a small cart a bloody cloth on top
nakagawa and igarashi enter
the coroner stands nervous
he walks to one of the tables and pulls back the sheet
have you determined a cause of death
the blood on his body isnt his
it belongs to her
he points to the other table
but doesnt look at it
i dont understand
he killed yoko before he died
the coroner shakes his head
nakagawa looks to igarashi then walks up to the second body pulling back the sheet
still missing her jawbone
nakagawa and igarashi stare down at her in disbelief
the coroner walks to the small table removing the cloth
yokos jawbone is underneath it
the jawbone you found in the attic yesterday with the american couple belongs to this girl
i estimate it was removed from her body two or three days ago
but i thought you said her body was found with this man tonight
the coroner nods
eyes on his shoes
then how did she get from the house to the health center
the coroner lost in his imagination answers quietly i have no idea
nakagawa walks to the jawbone
stares at it
she survived for two days without this
it would seem so
how is that possible
the coroner looks up at him his face pale
i dont believe it is
doug sits on the bed next to a dressing curtain
karens silhouette is visible behind it pulling on her clothes
he watches the curtain for a beat concerned
then i got us a guidebook to kyoto
i thought maybe wed leave tomorrow the curtain suddenly slides back
karen dressed stares at him
she looks angry
why didnt you tell me
tell you what
about the bodies they found in the attic
you were recovering from a shock
i didnt want to karen turns away picking up her backpack and slinging it
she walks past him disappointed and leaves the room
karen wait he quickly grabs his coat and bag
a a karen paces down the hall towards a reception area
doug catches up with her turning her towards him
look im sorry
i was just worried about you and i know you karen
karen turns to him
a sober look on her face
revisions blue a
the same thing happened three years ago doug
to a japanese family who lived in that house
they were all found dead
doug studies her for a moment
so you think the events are connected
how would you explain it
she watches doug as he thinks
how about this the american family knew about what had happened there before and this knowledge subconsciously caused them to repeat the same events
karen gives doug a skeptical look
its exactly how superstitions survive if you walk under a ladder and think uh oh youre in for some bad luck sure enough what do you know
you trip over heard it before trip over the curb and sprain your ankle
makes sense right
karen stops walking
revisions blue b
then explain this when i went to that house i didnt know anything about its past
but yet i still saw
she hesitates realizing shes said too much
emma and i were alone in that room but there was something else there
im sure of it
you watched a woman die kat
thats a horrible thing to experience
i cant imagine how you must feel
but sometimes the mind tries to cope with terrible things in a way that distorts what actually occurred
karens eyes never leave his
softly but firmly you might be right doug
but i know what i saw
then faltering i think i know what i saw
after a moment doug pulls her into a hug
you just need to rest
well get you home get a good nights sleep
but her eyes speak differently
she covers it well stepping back and glancing over at the reception desk youve got class and im sure i only have to fill out a few forms or something
revisions blue ba
im fine doug
he kisses her then exits
he pauses at the front doors to give her a little wave
but the smile droops as soon as hes out of sight
after a moment she turns and walks to the front desk
revisions blue c
karen sits at her computer desk
she looks exhausted
online karen pulls up the home page for the japan times an english language newspaper
she types toshios full name into a search window
a list of links appear filling the screen
karen scans them
its not what shes looking for
she re enters toshios name along with a year
only one link appears
the word murdered in the headline
karen clicks it
the article fills the screen
as karen reads it we catch glimpses of names toshio kayako takeo
and an ominous phrase murder suicide
karen clicks a link marked image
a scanned picture of the newspaper appears the article is on the front page with familiar photos of toshio kayako and takeo
but then karens eyes drift to another picture at the bottom of the page peter
she quickly recognizes him from the picture she found in the journal
his name is printed below the photo
a picture of peter and marias condo building is next to it
she looks at the headline american english teacher throws karen scans the article thinking
then she looks up at nakagawa is looking at the same picture in his file
officer appears in the hall
knocks gently on the door
this just came in
its the surveillance video you requested
it takes a moment for nakagawa to snap out of it
he finally nods takes the tape
he opens the envelope and looks at the cassette
like he doesnt want to watch it
then he turns to a tv vcr combo and inserts the tape
on the screen the th floor hallway from susans office building and the door leading to the stairwell
the image flickers for a moment
then the door suddenly bursts open and susan terrified runs from the stairwell and down the hall
on nakagawa he fast forwards the video
until revisions blue
on screen the security guard appears in the hallway
as susan saw earlier he opens the door to the stairwell and looks inside
then he closes the door and continues o
on nakagawa he reaches forward to turn off the video on screen but then the video crackles with a quick burst of static
and the door to the stairwell opens again
on nakagawa hes watching entranced terrified
he can hardly believe what hes seeing on screen a dark figure emerges from the stairwell
its the shape of a woman with long hair but the figure is blurry and shifting as if the black shadow has loosely compacted itself into the form of a
nakagawa watches breathless as the figure slowly enters the hallway passing by underneath the camera
the image stops flickering
an empty hallway now
nakagawa his hand shaking reaches forward about to turn off the television set when darkness suddenly overtakes the screen rising up from the bottom until everything is dark
a strange humming rattle comes from the speakers and the image jitters madly
nakagawa leans forward right up to the screen trying to make out an image in the swirling blackness two eyes open staring at nakagawa
terrified nakagawa stands and turns away closing his eyes
and when he finds the strength to look back the eyes are still there
locked onto him even though hes moved
nakagawa stands at the front door
gathering his courage
he opens the door
nothing but yawning darkness inside
nakagawa picks up two heavy objects one in each hand and ducking under the police tape enters the house
nakagawa puts the two heavy objects by the front door and closes it
now we can see what they are gasoline cans
two gallons each
nakagawa catches his breath
then he reaches for the lid of one of the cans starting to unscrew it
his hands are shaking and the gasoline splashes around inside but then theres another splashing sound
the splashing continues
his eyes go to the bathroom door
the splashing is coming from inside accompanied by a series of thuds
the sounds of a small child struggling
nakagawa fearfully reaches for the door handle a a nakagawas eyes widen as the door swings open
he sees a young boy kneeling by the edge of the tub overflowing with water
his head hangs below the surface
nakagawa immediately drops to the boy lifting his lifeless head from the water
before nakagawa can understand whats happening the boys eyes suddenly open fixing on nakagawa and then a pale hand grabs nakagawas head from behind and roughly pushes it into the
water holding him under
nakagawas legs flail and kick as he struggles his screaming muffled by the water
but finally his legs become still

the wall by karens computer desk is now covered with webpage print outs newspaper clippings of toshio and his parents kayako and takeo matthew and jennifer peter and detectives nakagawa
and igarashi plus reports on the earlier in the center of it all is a picture of the house
on the desk is a print out the newspaper article about peters death with the photo of his condo

b omitted b karen is in the shower
she stands there glassy eyed as the water runs over her
shes looking at her reflection in the mirror
it fogs up obscuring the view
this snaps karen out of her trance
she rinses her hair and squeezes some shampoo into her hand
starts a nice lather
from behind karen works the shampoo into her scalp
but as she does we see something
a pale hand buried under her hair as if someone is behind her with a hand on her head
karens fingers brush the hand
she cries out and turns theres no one there
theres the sound of the front door unlocking and doug enters carrying a bag
he closes the door behind him and walks in turning the corner finding karen looking a bit dazed standing right there
hes startled but quickly recovers i come bearing gifts
karen smiles weakly
she takes the bag and enters the kitchen
he watches her go worried
then he notices her desk
doug walks over looking at the printouts shes taped to the wall
and the photo of the house in the center
bewildered he sits down leaning forward and taking a good look
his eyes stop on the picture of toshio
doug turns to see karen staring at him from the kitchen
its an awkward moment hes concerned but doesnt know what to say
and neither does karen
finally she approaches looking at toshios picture revisions blue a
thats the boy who was there yesterday
in that house
but this boy hes her voice trembles her fear showing through
hes supposed to be dead
karens eyes plead with doug
i saw him doug
i talked to him
he told me his name
a boy who was killed by his father three years ago told me his name
doug looks away shaking his head
you dont believe me
how can i believe you karen
karens face darkens
before she can retort the phone rings
as karen walks across the room to answer it doug starts reading the newspaper article
her face slowly drops
almost a whisper what
she numbly lowers the phone
doug turns to her seeing that somethings very wrong
snapping to life karen walks to the desk picking up the photo of peter and marias condo and a map of tokyo
doug puts a hand on her shoulder
she finally looks at him
alex and yoko are dead
doug surprised doesnt know what to say
karen doesnt give him a chance to figure it out revisions blue aa

revisions blue b
we see the resolve come over karens face
she reaches out and touches doug tenderly
i love you
but i have to go
doug troubled turns back to the desk
he looks up at the wall tracing a finger over the photo of the house
beneath it is the address
the same building from the newspaper clipping
monolithic against a cloudy bleak sky
karen stands before it staring up at it
then she walks to the intercom and looks at the directory finds m
she activates the intercom and dials the number
it rings a few times and then a voice picks up yes
im looking for maria kirk

karen stares at the intercom

peter marias apartment day a the front door opens
maria early s has changed from when we first saw her she wears a revealing outfit and her natural beauty now smolders beneath the surface
she regards karen warily
im late for work
i just need a couple minutes
maria finally steps aside letting karen in
the apartment is small and completely unkempt
the kitchen is a mess clothes lie everywhere
sarcastic make yourself at home
karen looks for a place to sit
she decides to stand
maria sizes her up
your husband peter
three years ago he
she trails off in delicate territory
he killed himself
maria eyes her blankly
then she turns to look at something o
karen follows her gaze to the open door of the bedroom
and the window beyond
revisions blue a
almost ashamed im
maria turns back to her sadness on her face
then thank you
maria reaches for a pack of cigarettes
offers them to karen
she shakes her head
how did you know peter
then what are you doing here
i think theres a connection between your husbands death and something that happened to me
what happened to you
hard to explain
maria takes a drag from her cigarette
look i know this sounds strange but
i dont think your husband wanted to die
even then why would he throw himself out a window
karen struggles to find the answer
let me guess hard to explain
marias brave face slips
she turns away
revisions blue b
i put all this behind me
i dont want to open it back up again
if thats true then why are you still here in japan
maria turns back
she only looks defensive for a moment
because i cant leave
but i couldnt
maria speaks softly forming words shes never spoken aloud he usually didnt wake up before me
but that morning he did
he made coffee for us
then he sat there and waited for me to wake up
and when i did he looked me right in the eye
and then he jumped
the night before wed been talking about having children together
she wipes away the tears in her eyes
did you know a woman named kayako
i dont think so
maria turns away growing tense
maybe it was someone he worked with
ive had the police up here i talked with detectives i even hired a p
composing herself revisions blue c
maria contd i dont know what youre going through or what you think you know about my husband
but i dont have any answers
she turns back to karen to find the young woman sitting slumped on the edge of a sofa tears in her eyes
maria softens as karen looks up at her pleading please
i dont know what else to do
please help me
maria reaches up to a high shelf
she moves a few things aside to get to two shoeboxes buried towards the rear
peter marias apartment day a maria re enters the room laying the shoeboxes on a table
this is all his stuff from school
she stares at the boxes afraid to open them
karen sits down and gently removes the lid of one of them
the box contains stacks of photographs and notes
karen removes a pile of photos and starts looking through it
after a moment maria sits down next to her
she opens the other box and pulls out another stack of photos
she looks at the first one sadness crossing her face
this was our first date
she shows karen the top photo a self portrait of peter and maria in a park lined with blooming cherry trees
the pain returns and she puts the picture away
karen works through her own pile shes looking at pictures of peter from his university days
her eyes widen as she sees kayako
she looks young and alive
but yet somehow sullen and withdrawn as if she feels she doesnt belong there
shes with a group of fellow students
peter is in the group although he and kayako arent next to one another
karen turns to the next picture its a graduation party
kayako is in this one too standing to the side watching peter and maria as they give a goofy grin to the camera
revisions blue a
as karen flips through them a definite pattern emerges kayako is in practically every picture
and in most shes not smiling at the camera
rather shes staring at peter
under her breath oh my god
did you find something
we move to the group photo
peter with maria surrounded by classmates
kayako off to the side her eyes on peter
the same group photo is in a frame on peters desk
peter stands behind the desk using a small mirror to knot his tie
his open door reads department of english
a co worker s japanese enters with a stack of mail
heres your mail
he hands it to peter
on the top is a small blue envelope
the name in the return address is kayako
another one huh
peter shakes his head looking distastefully at the letter
i dont even know her
she says i used to tutor her but i dont know who the hell she is
the co worker shrugs and leaves
disturbed peter fingers the blue envelope
his eyes go to one of his desk drawers
he slides it open
more blue envelopes are inside
all from kayako
peters face darkens
he dumps the letters into a trash can
peter stands in front of the house
he glances down at the blue envelope in his hand
he stuffs it in his pocket unsure about what hes going to do
then he opens the gate and goes in walking to the front door
silence from inside
he rings the bell
no one comes
hes about to leave but then he hears something from around the side of the house
it sounded like a muffled splash of water
the house side day a peter peers around the side of the house a narrow walkway lined with bushes and trees
after a moment peter decides to check it out
as he steps around a bush he suddenly stops surprised to see peters pov two arms hang from a window at the side of the house
they look disembodied mottled and bruised
revisions blue a
it takes peter a moment to recover
he slowly walks over
a familiar boy is inside its toshio
his glazed and staring eyes dont seem to notice peter standing right in front of him
theres definitely something wrong with this boy
peter looks beyond him into the dark house
my name is peter
im here to see your mother
is she home
the boy slowly straightens
his eyes focus on peter
then he falls backwards
startled peter tries to see inside hey
are you okay
peter quickly goes back to the front door
tries the handle its unlocked
he opens the door
peter steps inside unsure about entering uninvited
calling out hello
im coming in
his concern for the boy wins out
he kicks off his shoes and quickly walks to the open bathroom door
peter enters finding toshio lying on the floor
he must have been standing on the edge of a tub by the window
are you alright
as peter helps the boy to his feet he glances at the bathtub
its filled literally to the brim with water
peter holds toshios hand as he leads him back to a couch in the living room
are you alone
where are your parents
the boy sits in the couch slumped over still looking dazed
peter studies him looking at the ugly bruises on his arms and legs
theres also a big one around his neck
what happened to you
peter reaches out to lift toshios chin but he flinches pulling backwards
his eyes manage to focus on peter
then the boy looks away
lowers his head
a long beat
this really doesnt look good
he scans the messy room eyes falling on something
he reaches down and picks up pieces of a photograph lying next to a broken frame theyve been crumpled into a ball
on the photo peter unfolds the pieces and rearranges them
weve seen this picture before a family portrait
toshio holding a cute black cat
standing with his mother and father kayako and takeo
theyre all beaming at the camera a perfect happy family
except that the mothers face has been torn out
then theres a muffled meow
peter looks over at the window
did that come from outside
peter walks to the window looking out
from outside looking in a worried look crosses peters face as the meow becomes more of a growl as if in warning
he looks outside but cant see anything revisions blue
but we see over peters shoulder that toshio is now looking directly at him eyes wide the meowing emitting from his wide open mouth karen enters quickly going up to
the front desk
officer filling out paperwork doesnt look up
excuse me i need to speak with detective nakagawa
officer looks up at her
its an emergency
officer walks to the end of the desk where two more officers speak in hushed tones with detective aoki
officer interrupts their conversation
and they all look over at karen
then detective aoki approaches
you are asking for detective nakagawa
yes i have important information for him about a case
she looks around
everyone is watching her
the mood is decidedly grim
she can tell somethings up
detective nakagawa is not here right now
can you tell me what case this is regarding
theres something behind the detectives words
his partner detective igarashi
can i speak with him
aoki exchanges a look with the officers
can you tell me your name please
karen looks at the somber faces in the quiet station
she backs away from the desk as the realization sinks in
theyre dead arent they
karen turns and runs for the exit
miss wait please but shes long gone
a reading light on the computer desk provides the only illumination in the dark apartment
karen enters standing in the doorway for a moment
as she slides off her coat doug
revisions blue a
she slowly walks to the bedroom and looks inside
hes not there
this seems to worsen karens mood
karen looks down at a notepad
shes written three japanese names
the detectives in charge of the case three years ago
they all have red lines drawn through them
then we pan up to see that these are the last names on a longer list
we recognize the other names matthew jennifer and emma williams yoko and alex nakagawa and igarashi
everyone whos been in the house
everyone who died
all the names have been crossed out except nakagawa and igarashi
karen picks up a red pen and draws a line through them
then we see one final name at the bottom me
now the only one not crossed out
the only one left
karen puts down her pen
then she looks up at the wall wheres shes taped all the pictures and articles in a circle
karen realizes something
she reaches for the lamp and turns it closer the picture in the middle of the spiders web is gone
the photo of the house
karen draws a breath
then out of the corner of her eye she sees something she hadnt noticed before a faint red flashing from a small table by the kitchen
she slowly stands
walks over to it
the flashing red light is barely visible on her face as she looks down at her answering machine
the message light is blinking
she reaches out a shaky finger and presses play
i just wanted to say im sorry
i know i wasnt hearing you
doug on machine contd if all this is real to you then its important to me and im gonna check that house out
so just sit tight i wont be long
i love you
karen presses the stop button
she stands there for a moment in the near darkness
then softly no
karens apartment building night a karen runs outside struggling to pull on her coat
she races down the sidewalk at top speed
b b doug stands at the gate lighting a cigarette looking down at the police tape sealing the entrance
he pockets his zippo and ducks under the tape walking up to the front door
doug tries the handle and the door swings open
he stands on the porch looking into the dark place
street night bb karen runs down the steps from the train racing into the c int
the house entrance night c doug steps inside trying the light switch
but he smiles shaking his head completely unafraid
as he takes a step forward his foot bumps the gas cans still sitting by the front door
hes confused and then he gets a good idea
he tosses his cigarette outside and closes the front door
revisions blue a
the house living room night d doug walks through the living room glancing inside the small kitchen then he slides open the door to the tatami room
he winces as his eyes meet the stained mattress
the house entrance night e doug re enters the entryway looking back up to the second floor
he starts up
the house second floor hallway night f doug walks to the front room door and opens it
he leans inside trying to let his eyes adjust to the dark
then he walks down the hall to the rear room
does the same
nothing but darkness beyond
doug closes the door and turns away from it wondering why hes here what hes looking for
he reaches into his pocket and pulls out his cell phone
speed dials karens number
as he raises it to his ear he doesnt notice the door to the rear room slowly karen runs towards us breathless stopping as she reaches the house
looming over her
she only hesitates a moment before running inside
karen enters calling out doug
where are you
a muffled sound from upstairs
karen immediately runs up the stairs to the second floor
before she reaches the top of the stairs karen suddenly realizes the voice shes hearing isnt dougs
hey maria its me
yeah im still at school
karen slowly looks up to see revisions blue
she recognizes him immediately
hes standing in the hallway talking on his cell phone
i know im sorry these staff meetings always run over maybe another ten minutes or so okay ill be home soon i love you too
he hangs up
leans against the wall
looking into the front bedroom
karen gasps as she sees toshio through the open door
hes sitting on the ground making drawings of black cats
this is his bedroom
under his breath guess your moms late huh
then toshio suddenly looks up
right at karen
following toshios gaze peter quickly turns to face karen
but even though shes right there he doesnt see her shes seeing something that happened three years ago
as if sensing her presence peter walks right to the edge of the stairs looking down
then a rustling sound comes from the dark hallway
peter turns towards the rear bedroom at the end of the hall
peter stands in the doorway looking into the master bedroom of toshios parents
his attention is drawn to something near the door a desk
its got a computer some files
someones personal work space
peter steps to the desk
he picks up a stack of photographs
family pictures with father takeo mother kayako and son toshio holding his black cat
kayakos face has been torn out of every one
peter notices something underneath the pile of photos a familiar journal
the same one karen found in the closet
he opens it
his pov its a journal kayako kept
as peter flips through it kayakos voice speaks the words
and even though its mostly japanese theres one word we recognize that shes written repeatedly peter
its been written over and over in both english and japanese as if she couldnt get enough of seeing it
past the early pages karen saw the writing becomes more manic the delicate script becoming a frantic scrawl kayakos voice becomes more desperate and pleading
taped on the final page is a photo peter with a group of his university friends at a party
kayako has scribbled hearts around his head and scratched out the other faces
a bloody thumbprint distorts peters face
its still wet
peter slams the book shut and drops it
as he does a photograph falls out from inside landing right side up
the photo is of peter at a college party talking with maria
its clear theyre having a great time with one another
but the photo is torn in half splitting marias face
and kayako is visible between them sadly and stoically watching peter strands of hair falling down her face
peter and karen both reach to pick up the photo at the same time and they bump shoulders
karen falls backwards against the wall
in disbelief peter looks around wildly
he reaches out a tentative hand feeling around
karen moves out of the way
she cant understand how this could be happening
as peter is about to stand back up something small flutters down from above landing on the floor in front of him
its kayakos face
one of the missing pieces from the torn out photographs
peter slowly looks up to see all the missing kayako faces have been pinned to the closet door
many of the pins go through her eyes
and thats when peter and karen hear the flies
sounds like theres a lot of them
its coming from the closet
just behind the torn out faces
revisions blue a
karen watches terrified as peter reaches out a hand and slides the door open
he immediately recoils
a terrible stench inside
the buzzing of the flies is louder
coming from above
peter pulls a book of matches from his pocket
and looks up
his pov the attic panel is slightly open
peter reaches up to open it fully and the upper half of kayako swings down
shes been wrapped in plastic sheeting mottled splotches of blood on the inside
her neck hangs at an odd angle
peter backs away in horror peter backs into the hallway breathing hard
then a familiar sound reaches our ears thud
its coming from toshios room
and its the same rhythmic thudding weve heard coming from this room before
peter wrenches his gaze from the horrific sight and heads quickly down the hall with karen following him toshio
we have to he stops short at the door as he sees takeo toshios father
eyes rolled back in his head tongue swollen and lolling from his blue lips
hes dead hes hanging from the ceiling by black hair that seems to cover its entire surface
toshio now back to his dead appearance playfully swings the body
takeos feet thud rhythmically against the wall
oh my god
peter doesnt stay to see any more
peter tears down the stairs and runs for the front door passing a mirror he freezes
he saw something in the reflection as he passed
he takes a step back and looks its not his reflection in the mirror
peter stares at the image in disbelief
then he notices toshio standing next to kayako looking up at her
revisions blue a
as peter slowly turns to look down a small pale hand slips into his own
peter jerks backward in shock as takeo looking down at the journal reading his wifes words his face contorted with rage
he turns to see kayako home from work standing in the doorway
kayako running down the steps takeo chasing her tackling her before she can reach the door
sitting on top of her he wraps his hands around her neck
kayako seeing toshio her son watching through the bars of the second floor railing as
takeo snaps kayakos neck with an audible crack
kayako not dead but paralyzed watching as
takeo drowns a flailing toshio in the bathroom tub
takeo tears apart toshios cat still alive in the bathroom sink
kayako letting out a horrible croaking the only sound her broken neck can emit as takeo advances on her with a knife his eyes filled with a manic madness
takeo in the attic stuffing kayako and toshio both very dead wrapped in plastic sheeting into a corner
kayako suddenly turning her head and grabbing takeos arm
her lifeless eyes focusing on takeos as she croaks
takeos eyes go wide with fear
and toshio suddenly reaches from his plastic grave grabbing takeos other arm
we pan from peter to the reflection in the mirror its not the pale frightening kayako anymore
rather a beautiful young kayako with eyes filled with sorrow
we pan back to see karen standing there instead of peter
karen slumps to the ground in front of the mirror the revelation taking everything out of her
then that came from upstairs
karen looks up as the sound continues
we pan over towards the stairs as a dragging sound moves across the ceiling
accompanied by a strange scraping like plastic
please no more
she suddenly freezes sensing something next to her
we see it now as she turns her head almost hidden in the darkness revisions blue
a pale face in the darkened hallway staring up at the ceiling
eyes wide and rolled back mouth yawning open in abject terror its dougs body
he lies on his back his top half sticking out from a niche by the stairwell
its been right next to her all along
karen takes doug into her arms as the sounds continue above growing closer
but its no use hes dead
and now theres a new sound moving down the stairs
a familiar throaty croaking sound along with a strange skittering like the worlds biggest cockroach
karen turns to the staircase to see kayako crawling down the stairs
still wrapped in the plastic sheeting she moves like a wounded animal neck hanging limply struggling to pull herself forward her eyes locked on karen croaking horribly karen sorrow turns
to abject terror
she tries to lift dougs body and pull it to the front door
its too heavy
and kayako is getting closer
sobbing karen drops doug and falls back against the front door bumping into the gas cans
the one nakagawa unscrewed tips over spilling gasoline into the entryway
as dougs arm flops to the floor his outstretched hand lands next to karen
she sees something clenched in his fingers his zippo lighter
realization dawns over karen as she feels the liquid spilling onto her hands
the odor is unmistakable
karen immediately reaches forward trying to loosen dougs grip on the lighter as kayako reaches the bottom of the stairs
her broken neck makes a horrific cracking as she swivels to face karen
karen finally gets the lighter
she pushes back against the door with legs too numb to stand
her eyes drift up to see revisions blue a
toshio watching from the railing above as before his cold eyes locked on hers
karen grabs another can and spins the lid until it pops off
she tips it onto the floor spilling more gas
kayako doesnt seem to care
she crawls over dougs body and pulls herself through the gasoline slowly drawing inexorably closer karen drops the empty gas can and opens dougs lighter
she flicks it
karen tries the lighter again
kayako reaches out blood dripping from her gaping mouth the lighter catches
karen flails with her free arm and opens the front door just as kayako grabs her ankle
karen reaches outside anchoring a hand to the door frame but she cant pull herself free as kayako pulls herself closer her croaking intensifying resigned karen slowly lowers the flame
to the gas can and ignites the gas
theres a sudden bright flash that overtakes the screen a a the flashing lights of police cars wash over the formerly quiet neighborhood illuminating revisions blue
shes lying on a gurney regaining consciousness
japanese emts are speaking to her as shes being loaded into the back of an ambulance
karens pov the blurry forms of firemen rush by in slow motion
everything is dizzy and incoherent
karen tries to sit up but a young emt lays a gentle hand on her arm deftly sliding a needle under her skin
the sedative takes hold almost immediately
karen sinks back into the gurney her eyes rolling back in her head
shes fading fast
ambulance night b the emts secure the gurney inside and close the doors
karen fights the drug but its grip is inevitable she finally gives up sliding into a medicated sleep
we slowly move in on her face until it fills the screen
c c the light changes
darkness becomes morning sunlight spilling across karens face
the tranquil sound of birds chirping surrounds us
but it sounds like a distant echo
karens eyelids flutter
she opens her eyes and sits up now wide awake but peaceful and calm
she gently swings her legs from the gurney and walks to the window confused by the daylight
she looks out to see d d its the most beautiful weve ever seen it
a lush springtime bloom fills the trees and bushes around the place
voices off screen japanese are audible getting closer revisions blue a
on karen as she is surprised to see
beautiful and meek
shes smiling walking hand in hand with takeo
a happy couple
as they reach the front door and go inside kayako turns back to the front gate
she smiles and gestures come on
and then toshio walks forward through the gate
his attention is on a tiny black kitten in his arms
at the door toshio turns to look back over his shoulder directly at karen
they hold each others gaze for a moment as if he somehow sees her in the ambulance
then kayako gestures to toshio and he turns away entering the house and closing the door
