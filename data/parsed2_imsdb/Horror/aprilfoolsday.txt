written by danilo bach rev st draft july the sparkling waters
the chirping spring day
we are on an isolated stretch of country shore and a quiet sheltered island is visible distantly across the sound
there is asense of anticipation excitement
voices can be heard
the camera is the pov of a video camera and a group of college kids wait just o
on screen however for the moment a proper sweet faced young coed faces the camera and reluctantly under the urging of her friend behind the video lens sets the scene
my name is mary oreilly otoole oshea and
over there is the island my friend muffy owns
its spring break
and shes invited us over for the weekend and were waiting for the ferry now to take us there
blushing mortified to cameraman i dont know what else to say
tell us something about yourself
something about myself
composing herself earnestly well i want to work with handicapped children
my parents are my best friends
next semester i start convent school and i
fuck on the first date
her friends explode with laughter
brassy former deb nikki brashears gives us a big wet wink dropping the act
nikki you are my kind o gal
he pans the camera over to kit a pretty unaffected natural beauty bright and very much aware
cmon kit how about you
kit waves him off laughing in spite of herself
shes got nothing to say
he pans over to the other two college boys on the dock here arch a big good natured easygoing wasp jock rugby and crew and skip mr
preppy the perfect image of the lazy spoiled indulged and reckless upper crust kid
skip also happens to be muffys cousin
ponders it with due consideration yeah sure
i fuck on the first date
skip cracks up
archs laughter follows
chaz quick pans the camera back to kit following the action
teasing with innuendo yeah kit where is he
concerned kit keeps her humor anyway waving the lens away again
oh cmon chaz give me some room will you
he does finally shutting down the videopak
the image reverts to film again
looks at her persisting well
the driver a still great looking turned out fairfield county type suburban lady and the passenger rob ferris a cleancut goodlooking year old public school grad sit in uncomfortable silence
on opposite ends of the front seat
gestures awkwardly herell be fine thanks
the volvo wagon pulls over
rob drags out his daypack too
for the lift i mean
smiles no reason for disappointment it was a real lift for me too hon
a late model detroit sedan slows at the intersection turning off the highway to take the junction in the direction rob is going
a road sign indicates bar harbor mount desert in another direction
rob hefts his gear hurrying to flag the sedan
the volvo wagon continues on braking for the next undergraduate male hitchhiking down the road
close on a wall calendar
a hand reaches into frame tearing off march to begin april
widen to reveal clara the middle aged housekeeper and offseason caretaker for the house
with her overcoat and purse on one arm she drops the march calendar page in a wastebasket then crosses to the pantry where a door and wooden steps lead down
to the basement
the rooms are all in order double and triple checked and im on my way
she hears a clatter from down below
john drags a womans body across the floor
the arm comes off in her hand
need any help down there
clara comes clopping down the steps
muffy turns the mannequins arm still in her hand
old workclothes and a head kerchief take the place of muffys normally impeccable prep seven sisters outfit including the regulation penny loafers in all this dust
early s pretty in an off beat sort of way muffy is every inch a blue blood
puffing with the effort no clara thanks
just trying some last minute straightening down here
god i dont think ive ever worked so hard in my life
sure you dont want me to stay
theres nobody gonna be around here to help till first ferry back monday yknow
continuing with her work nope youre a peach clara
but this ones mine
i told my father id do it and i will
i dont want him to have any excuses
dubiously turning to go all right then
have a nice party
a buoyant laugh nice
it has to be better than nice
its gotta be bloody unforgettable
clara climbs the stairs
see you monday
soon theres the upstairs sound of the kitchen door closing behind clara
muffy finally props the mannequin clearing away the remaining clutter
she goes to open a basement window for ventilation
it is a ground level transom hinged at the top
through it clara is visible departing the grounds
then muffy hears a dripping
she turns hesitating and follows the sounds
part of the basement an old washroom and more with tub slop sink and large incinerator
muffy enters pulling the chain on the bare overhead bulb
it illuminates the room and the tub underneath slightly rusty at the drain but otherwise spotless and the slowly dripping faucet
chaz the videocameraman and the only member of the group we havent seen till now is the first to spot the ferry approaching
here she comes
hes a real hi tech freak and ivy league wiseass a free spirit in neo punk neck curl and button down shirt
he shoulders his lightweight videopak again taping it
arch and skip watch with him from the end of the pier
but kit and nikki waiting nearer the office are distracted by the sound of an arriving car
its not rob though
its nan another newcomer
she pulls her car next to the others in the gravel lot behind the landing office and gets out quickly dragging a hefty suitcase out of the back seat
she is an unfamiliar face to kit and nikki a shy earnest small town girl overdressed for the occasion
is this the ferry to the st
any second now
oh thank goodness
i didnt know if i was on the right road
kit smiles welcome lending a hand as nan struggles the bag up the ramp
needling about the suitcase planning on staying a while
flushes embarrassed oh no
just some work for finals when we get back
you dont know how far behind i am
arch outhustles chaz for her bag
her simple attractiveness exerts an appeal
ive seen you around
jewett hall right
you got great legs
pointed y reminds him chaz arch already has her bag
meaning chaz is nikkis man especially for this weekend
volunteering happily well i only met muffy this term in drama society
i volunteered to do their costumes
i like to sew
did you see her in ghosts
shes so talented
she was wonderful
to nan approvingly in greeting congratulations on finding your way
the landing bumps the ferry touches down
they look up
the large raw boned ferryman holds open the wooden stile for the one and only passenger from the island clara to disembark
clara passes them giving first skip and then the others a look shaking her head in sad appraisal
ok lets go
its not the friendliest greeting in the world
the ferryman keeps the stile open for them to board singly
there is also a younger assistant on board buck a pleasant openfaced townie in his s
to the rear
outa the operators way
nikki clutches at skips arm
this is it
no going back
trapped for days on an island where men are men and women oughta know better
try to control yourself sister otoole
you could tie me in chains
chaz boards passing buck the assistant
a low whisper your flys open and your hostess twinkies hanging out
the assistant gapes falling for it groping his fly
which is closed of course
he looks up grinning
chaz kisses him on the cheek winks and moves on
sh i i t
kit is hanging back on the dock
come on if youre coming
but were still waiting for somebody its friday
my last run of the week
i dont get paid overtime
but youve got to wait
they said its the only way over
if he misses this
arch whistles loudly seeing and alerting them
a late model detroit sedan the one we saw earlier turning off the highway pulls to a fast stop in the lot
rob hurries out a cheer comes up from the group on the ferry
kit closes her eyes in relief
rob comes hurrying up the ramp
followed closely by harvey hal edison jr
harvey is the driver of the sedan and after he carefully locks up he comes running with his bag too
he is a rangy straight arrow ivy league farmboy from the border south and hes the last of muffys invited guests
he also somewhat incongruously sports a bruce springsteen badge
to kit kissing her sorry
to skip and nan whom he doesnt know rob ferris
they return greetings
harvey hal edison jr
but please call me hal
only my folks call me harve
and i cant stand it
boy this sure is a pretty spot
stylistically hes a martian
chaz stares at him
youre friends with
we sit together in econ
i let her copy my marginal utility curves
i get it
thats a joke
preppy skip adds his greeting
an ironical nod harve
correcting him blithely hal
noticing interest his badge springsteen hes still the boss
ok cmon i dont have all day
he slams the stile down after harvey the last to board and gets busy with the stubborn motor
his assistant helps
enthusiastically putting down his fear you all buddies
except for skip and nan
them we just met
but we will be
watch what you say around him though
hes muffys cousin
tickled to skip no kiddin
over the horizon
otherwise i wouldnt be invited
frowns tellingly old money never mixes family with friends
this is true
for as long as ive known her
to protect her family i guess
to keep her friends
he turns to arch holds up his hand and click a switchblade opens into the lens
choose your weapons big guy
nervously a laugh hey whats this
you up for a game of stretch
still taping to skip your flys open
undaunted to rob your flys open
ok so dont believe me
he keeps the tape rolling
rob discreetly looks down
his fly is open
kit looks at him dubiously
chaz beams getting it all for posterity
the engine finally engages
the ferry lurches
smiles weakly to kit were off
they are indeed
the ferry pulls away from the mainland
a closer angle
the sturdy barge like ship craft makes progress
the ferryman and buck remain at the stern
as skips knife flies into frame it bites into the boards and holds
at their game
arch stretches cant reach the knife and topples over
skip hoots triumphantly
first round the champ
nikki much to her chagrin finds herself the object of harveys attentions
yknow what i find amazin
muffys her real name
i mean im harvey but they call me hal so i thought muffy it must stand for something
muffers moffo muff child muffin stuff the muffster
i bet youre her oldest friend
actually shes three months older than i am
you know what i mean
are you planning a career in politics when you grow up
ive given it some thought
oh just a hunch
first though im hopin to interview with her daddys company southern regional sales next year before graduation
yknow hes worth moren mill over the counter
she just stares at him
digging into the deck again
arch and skip the knife is at an impossible distance
go for it big fella
arch swallows his pride and makes a hopeless attempt
fastens onto nan immersed in one of her books
he carries his own
sitting beside her whatcha readin
for professor russos course on the english epic
its a shame
its a dying form
not too many people read it nowadays even in college
suck and fuck
naked bodies writhing in heat
women with their tongues sticking out in desparate desire
nan tries to control her reaction to his stack of graphic pornographic video catalogues and magazines
the origins of american pornographic film
im taking an independent study this term
the passion and commitment show my advisors really behind me on it
were not gonna be sheltered college kids all our lives
someday im gonna have kids youre gonna have kids and someday that kids gonna come up to me and say god dad porns really a major part of our lives
you were there howd it get started
i wanna be able to answer their questions
besides its research i can do by myself
they keep their voices low
thats not my point you dont want me to hitch you want me to buy a car
ok but im a state university boy i dont have the perks like some of you private college kids do
oh cmon dont pull that
rob just drops his arms in frustration
i mean it may show something about your attitude toward me always being late
archs voice interrupts
annoyed loudly overriding the other conversations hey im really not interested anymore cmon just one more the others look up at the interruption
arch pushes the knife back into skips hand tired of playing knife toss
i said enoughs enough one more try double or nothing
he flips the knife to arch handle first
cmon give it a fuckin rest
he flips it back hard
skip looks up stunned
archs voice catches in his throat in horror
skip stares back disbelieving looking down and pulling his hand away from his chest where the blood begins to seep and the jackknife sticks out buried hilt deep between his
skip stumbles teetering there at the edge of the ferry
rob and chaz leap to their feet
the ferrymen both look up in disbelief
arch steps forward to help
but skip weaving topples and splashes overboard
he goes under
panicked hurrying to the side ill get him ill get him
but he stops just at the edge of the ferry immobilized by fear
rob rushes forward with chaz in reserve pulling arch out of the way
but buck the assistant ferryman pre empts them all diving in
arch frozen watches from the deck with the others
buck resurfaces but without any sign of skip
rob doesnt wait any longer
he pulls off his shoes and dives in
chaz gets ready to follow suit
the panic mounts
suddenly hi this what youre looking for
skip pulls himself up dripping on the other side of the ferry
he holds up the knife and the padded sash beneath his shirt he used to imbed the knife and grins from ear to ear
the others stare totally freaked
arch lets go jumping in the air
rob and buck surface to see as well
we got em
whoo ee did we nail em
as it dawns to skip april fools
you crazy jerks
you crazy motherfuckin jerks
somebody couldve gotten hurt out there
rob isnt laughing
but nobodys more impressed than assistant buck still treading water
you almost gave us a heart attack
kit glowers at them and gives rob a hand to get out
well at least we dont go in for this your shoelaceis untied crap
dripping to arch and skip i owe you one
smiles to buck in the water hows it goin out there
that was great
i was really counting on these other turkeys to save my ass
oh too bad
skip extends a hand to buck to help him out
sorry about that
but bucks in no hurry
the ferryman steps forward
unamused to buck ok cmon get out
they are approaching the landing dock on the island
to buck gruffly cmon im gonna need some help here
buck obeys but his way enjoying it ducking under the craft to swim to the other side to help
and watch out for the wire
theres a sickening thump i the young assistant suddenly breaks the surface qf the water panicked and stunned gasping for air
it happens too fast for any of them to do anything
buck thrashes dazed off balance falling back into the path of the ferry as it glides toward the landing
buck look out oh shit
the ferryman grabs the controls but it cant help
the ferry unstoppable plows into buck pinning him against one of the piers
the ferryman rushes forward to help
for a moment the others are spared the horror of it as the ferrymans back blocks their view
but then buck thrashing in the water tears himself loose screaming and bobbing
up his head and torso covered in blood the side of his face and his shoulder hideously deformed
it is awful
it is ghastly
and it is unforgettable
sam potter the middle aged township constable hears the cries and the screams
he drops what hes doing in his outboard and comes running
the ferryman jumps into the shallow water pulling buck onto shore
rob chaz and arch jump after to help but the ferryman pushes them angrily away
get away from him
buck is hysterical
the gashes of torn flesh seem to drip from his skull
seeing rob and the others he screams lunging vainly at them in agony
they did it
theres time for later
but its hard for him to restrain his own rage
constable potter arrives throwing the ferryman a towel to use
the ferryman catches it pressing it against bucks torn face
one maddened glaring eye still stares out hideously at the group
get him to the hospital cal
take my boat
he helps the ferryman lift buck
but the powerful ferryman needs no further help carrying buck to the constables motorboat moored nearby laying buck in untying the line and pulling the motor to life
buck continues to shriek terrifyingly
the ferryman cast one last glance back
the sound of the motorboat fades away
potter turns back to the stunned group eyeing them
lets have it
muffy drives up
she slows seeing through the windshield the somber scene at the pier
her friends in troubled conversation with constable potter
muffy gets out parking the new van beside an old island pick up which is kept at the dock
shes clean and dressed in her more usual preppy garb
whats going on
better ask your friends
bucks been hurt
cal just took him on over to the mainland
just lucky i was here
she returns his stare in dread silence
he boards the ferry
i came over to check on a report of some unauthorized activity in the area
your dad around
she startles the question unanticipated
no hes in sutton place
no word from him or anybody else
he tries the engine
just like i thought
he steps back onto the shore
ill have to borrow your outboard to get back to shore
we keep all the keys on the board in the kitchen but i think theres an extra one underneath the cushion there
she points to the boat seat
potter is much obliged
to the others sternly im glad youre stuck here all o you
if theres anvthin else or anything happens to buck
i want to know where to find you
the van moves slowly along a narrow road through the forest
from what we can see of its occupants the mood is pretty grim
behind it the old island pick up truck follows
rob drives with kit and skip beside him in the cab
nobody says anything
skip is off somewhere in his own private hell
finally he reaches over to roll down his window but the handle rotates uselessly in his grip
these goddamn windows
he starts banging violently on the door on the window
theyve never been fixed
look skip it wasnt your fault
it was an accident
you didnt know
he leaves off his banging
what a way to start a weekend huh
nothing bad ever happens to her
it is a truly grand affair two stories at least rambling and picture perfect with extensive tended grounds garage and outbuildings
muffy gets out first hopping around to the back to open the rear van gate for the bags
nan beholds the house for the first time
rob pulls the pick up right behind them
as they come in with their bags
well theres an awful lot to be done with this place
you sound as if you own it
she helps with bags shepherding them on ahead
i will if all goes well
next month when i turn
its my first stage inheritance
whats your second
you might be talking to your future boss harve
mom i am home
they all look to see him standing in the entrance to the living room
as they follow chaz into the room
a series of picture windows give a spectacular view of the sound
yeah i could get real used to this
we used to spend our summers here before my mother died
this is a very special place to me
its like a dream
on a clear day you can see the kennedys
from the dining room wow look at this
the others enter to see what chazs shout is all about
chaz stands before a large beautifully polished dining table that is set for each of them each place carefully marked with a name card and a ken or barbie doll
with the persons name on it
the settings themselves are idiomatic and economical plastic spoon and fork combination sets and paper cups plates napkins etc
in mock awe look
our very own place settings
with our very own place cards with ken or barbie
just like in agatha cristie
in the spirit and sporks
and napkins with little hallmark bunnies
gee muff you really spared no expense
how do you think father made all his money
the old fashioned way
he inherited it
meaningfully with her barbie i used to have all her outfits
dont anybody move
chaz jumps back from the table whipping out his videocam to record the moment and panning them all at
their respective places
one of us in this room
bellowing a mystery laugh pulls his wang
he ends the pan on arch who gives him the finger
dropping onto a hot skillet
muffy nikki and kit cooking a dinner of hot dogs
if only the choices werent so limited
god im so ready for a change
any kind of change
well you know everything they say about older men
kit and nikki stare at her open mouthed
like how much older are we talking about
add about thirty years
i dont believe you st
i dont want to hear about this
it was only a weekend
its over now
beat shrugs i was curious
he wasnt married
how should i know
kit and nikki just drop everything and continue to stare at her
it was quite a weekend
nikki starts to laugh
come to daddy
they all start to laugh now wickedly conspiratorially
come sit on daddys knee little girl
nikki falls to the floor in hysterics
my goodness daddy what big what big
teeth you have
the better to eat you with my dear
a richly paneled room with a fireplace desk leather upholstered chairs and lots of books
a door opens and harvey steps through looks back over his shoulder and enters
he is just snooping around
he surveys the books the framed diplomas on the walls along with autographed photos of u
presidents and other heads of state
he steps over to the desk opens a cigar box sitting there takes out a cigar and slips it into his pocket
arch and chaz are in the back lawn overlooking the sound
they are fooling around with chazs camera maybe clowning a bit
abroad veranda which runs along the entire length of the back of the house
skip and nan are sitting on the railing gazing over the sounds
skip has a drink
quietly with deliberation the poor boy can say fuck you dad
im my own person
what is his father going to do
kick him out of the house
his life wont have changed that much
hes got nothing to lose
his fathers love
thats already been lost
died a long long time ago
skip youre giving up
youre giving up before youve even gotten started
look at how young we all are
how young and foolish and innocent and stupid
skip raises his glass and gulps down the rest of his drink
a secluded area halfway down between the house and the shore
rob sits alone on a wooden bench and thinks
the dinner bell sounds
with bell in hand muffy turns and heads back into the house
chaz and arch come up onto the porch and follow her in
rob is just coming in from outside as muffy enters from the kitchen with the hot dogs and beans
everyone else is standing around the table
boy muff you sure know how to make a guy look forward to dessert
please god let it be ding dongs
john hospitality taken to the extreme
i think its real friendly
makes me feel right at home
everyone starts to sit down at his designated place
how friendly will we feel once weve finished with those beans
as soon as her ass hits the seat she lets slip an outrageous fart
she springs to her feet her face turning beet red
all conversation stops each person looking for the guilty party
nan discreetly sits back down but again as soon as her tail meets the chair another blast escapes her
all eyes are on her as she reaches beneath her and pulls out a whoopee cushion
so its going to be one of those dinners huh
arch is laughing the loudest when suddenly his chair collapses beneath him and he drops sprawling onto the floor
skip is searching through the darkened living room for something while in the adjoining room dinner is proceeding quietly
as he grabs the salt shaker and spills some of it out onto the table
he samples a couple of grains
its the real thing
he starts salting his food
i wonder how buck is doing
do you think we should call or something
ill call later
i think we should change the subject
well harveys got his job interview all figured out but what about the rest of us
anybody know what theyre going to be doing come graduation
they sit dumbly
good choice arch
i cant decide
id like to go to graduate school in english
i love the sound of our language
but im afraid theres not much future in it
i mean what are you supposed to do with a liberal arts major anyway
you fill out a lot of forms and then some friend of your family gives you a job delivering mail in his corporation
this is really incredible
look at us
here we are
privileged independent the hope of the future
and most of us still dont know what were going to do with our lives
hes going to medical school
rob looks up from his plate
hey no shit
you got early acceptance
reddens to kit we can talk about it some other time
you had your meeting with your counselor didnt you
i dont think rob really wants to talk about it in front of everybody
she gets up from the table and steps over to the sideboard
no i dont mind
were all friends
he said to forget it
kit looks up in surprise
they all stare quieting
he said my grades might be ok but that basically i possess an essential lack of seriousness and thats what they look for
oh shit him too
thats what my guy said
an i said youre kidding
how can anybody be serious about anything when some moron can steal a bomb or push a button and blow the rest of us right into mad max
he wasnt impressed
thats bullshit on parade
well fuck you
it sounded good at the time
muffy turns from the sideboard and sets a tray of champagne glasses in the center of the table
there are eight of them
each one is filled with a pinkish bubbly liquid
everybody reaches for a glass
what is this
dom perignon sparkling rose
it smells like ripple
youve outdone yourself again st
the back screen door slams shut o
behind skip leaving the house
they look up
who was that
can i make a toast
they turn attention toward her and she stands emboldened by their acceptance
someone once said to me to cherish the friends you make in i cherish all the friends i make
theyll be the friends you cherish most the rest of your life
so well heres to us
heres to my life
because im very glad to be here and to be a part of all of you
muffy anything you want to add to that
because youre the hostess
muffy thinks for a moment then adds
in his life of johnson james boswell said we cannot tell the precise moment when friendship is formed
as in filling a vessel drop by drop there is at last a drop which makes it run over so in a series of kindnesses there is at last one
which makes the heart run over
arch has started to make snoring sounds
so with this toast may our hearts run over and our friendships be formed
they stand unanimously raise their glasses in agreement start to drink and spill it all down the front of their shirts
muffy shows nikki the last of them to her room
nan says goodnight from her door
muffy leads nikki to a narrow sparse single popping open the door
just holler if you need anything
muffy turns back to her
beat seriously i know you and arch had something going before i met him
arch is sweet but hes only got two expressions
collar up and collar down
i found that out i guess what im trying to say is
you always seem to get there first
but this time chaz is mine ok
what about hal
muffy returns her smile continuing down the corridor
arch throws his duffle bag on a bed delighted
its a private suite with two beds
hey all right
ladies we are qonna have privacy
he turns his collar up on his polo shirt then eagerly pushes the two beds together
the other door to the connecting bathroom swings open
archs face drops as chaz walks in lugging his gear
you gotta be kiddin
unloading his gear
unless muffy knows something about us we dont
he blows arch a kiss pulling the two beds apart again
close up a match flaring to life
widen to feveal harvey lighting the cigar he took earlier out of the study
he puffs on it contentedly imagining himself a man of power
then he steps over to the bed and opens his suitcase to begin unpacking
to himself rehearsing dont tell me youve never thought of me in that way muffy
i felt a spark between us the very first moment we laid eyes on each other
why just think of it muffy
with my talent and your
he crosses to the closet with his navy blazer
why just think of it
muffers with my raw
driving talent and your
he opens the closet door
a newspaper photograph circled in red marker of a garish car accident is pinned to the inside of the door
he puzzles taking down the clipping putting it down on the dresser as he moves there to put away his rolled socks
he opens the top drawer
the same thing
full of newspaper clippings of awful fatal car crashes all circled in the same accusatory red ink
suddenly chaz burst in on him
harvey turns quickly shoving the clippings back in the drawer and slamming it shut
they stare at each other for a long uncomfortable moment
he ducks back out the door pulling it quietly closed behind him
outside harveys door
chaz sighs shakes his head starts to move away when suddenly there is a loud bang o
from inside harveys room
chaz turns quickly back to the door reaches for the handle stops himself thinks better of it and moves away again
nikki steps up to the sink in the adjoining bathroom turns the faucet and is squirted by a spray of water jetting out of the rigged plumbing
she quickly shuts off the water and just stands for a moment dripping
trying to control her anger
like enough with muffys jokes already
she comes out of the bathroom with a towel drying her face and walks to the dresser
she strips off her shirt pulls open the top dresser drawers and sees
an eyeless black rubber bondage hood and other miscellaneous s m accessories
she picks them up in disbelief
arch unloading his shaving bag which mainly contains a day supply of rubbers opens the medicine cabinet
on its shelf
a kit neatly filled with hypodermic syringes needles rubber tubing razor blades everything you could ever want for fixing
muffy on her way down to straighten up passes rob and kit on their way up
close on the shower head on the bathroom gushing water
nan is taking a shower
camera dollies back slowly out of the bathroom and into the bedroom
the shower is turned off
all is quiet
then very faintly at first we hear something it sounds like crying
as it grows gradually louder we realize that it is crying a baby crying
nan appears suddenly in the bathroom doorway
a towel is wrapped around her
the crying is louder now but muffled a baby crying for its mother
it seems to come from a large mahogany wardrobe on the other side of the room
nan tenses slowly approaohing then flinging open the wardrobe door
a small cassette recorder plays
the tape runs out
the babys cries stop
nan rips out the cassette and sinks back onto the bed burying her head in her hands
rob and kits room night rob and kit are standing together staring into camera
reverse to see the object of their attention
hanging on the wall in front of them is a large oil portrait with the eyes out out
something is moving behind the canvas watching them
rob steps forward and lifts the painting off the wall
behind it is an inset bookcase
sitting on one of the shelves at the proper height to have lined up with the holes in the portrait is a childs felix the cat nursery clock
the eyes of the plastic cat move back and forth like a pendulum marking seconds
rob sets the painting on the floor outside their bedroom door leaning it up against the wall
camera dollies in for a close up of the portrait
it looks much creepier with the now vacant eye sockets
they are undressing on opposite sides of the bed
the silence between them is thick enough to be cut with a knife
kit sits down slowly on the edge of the bed and quietly slips under the covers
rob gets in on his side
they sit in silence for a moment making no move to join each other in the middle of the bed
you still angry with me
im not angry with you
im just angry
he leans over turns off the bedside lamp
and the light in the bathroom comes on
he gets out of bed and crosses to the bathroom reaches in and turns off the light
and the overhead light comes on
kit starts to laugh and quickly covers her mouth
rob walks to the door turns off the overhead light
and the bedside lamp comes on again
kit laughs harder but still tries to stifle it
rob shoots her a look then goes and sits on the edge of the bed
he reaches to turn off the bedside lamp again then thinks better of it and starts to unscrew the bulb instead
burning his fingers ouch
kit cant stop herself any longer
she laughs out loud
rob perseveres finally unscrewing the bulb enough to plunge the room into darkness
kit breaks up laughing again
to her it is funny
and soon rob is laughing too
he swings his legs up under the covers beside her
muffy turns off the last of the lights downstairs leaving the porch light on for skip
muffy moves through the quiet to her room
arch grabs her
arch do you know what time it is
turning down his collar goodnight arch
gently but firmly she extricates herself closing the bedroom door behind her
undaunted he scuttles down the hall to rob and kits closed door to listen in
he frowns the slides farther down to nikkis room knocks once softly and enters
nikki is already occupied however with chaz
she catches archs stare signalling him to get the hell out
arch valorously steps back closing the door and returning to try nan
the light underneath her door flicks off however
the door is also locked
arch curses returning to his large but empty room
he slams the door for everybodys benefit
muffy undressing hears and smiles
arch is pacing the bedroom horny and alone
he gets an idea goes and rummages through chaz stuff and comes up with a video cassette of a porno movie
carrying the cassette he crosses to the door and turns the handle
the doorknob comes off in his hand
he throws it down in disgust goes and sits in a chair and broods
the chair collapses beneath him
skip makes his way boldly carelessly drunkenly along
overgrown weeds and tall spring grass choke the path shadowing his way
he takes one last drink killing the bottle and hurls it out into the night
after a long pause there is the distant sound o
of the bottle landing in water with a splash
skip emerges from the overgrowth
the abandoned old structure and its dock squat ahead at waters edge
beneath the boathouse floating in the water is a grungy old skiff covered by a tarp
skip turns away from the dock and flicks his lighter among the weeds finding marijuana growing there
he cackles with triumph
something moves nearby
he doesnt pay attention taking out his knife to cull the dried leaves
he cups them in his hand against the wind douses his lighter and hurries out onto the dock to the boathouse entrance to prepare his joint
as skip enters
it is pitch black in here and aside from the gentle lapping sounds of water against the pilings down below o
all is still
skip flips a lightswitch in the darkness and nothing happens
he edges slowly along a wall away from the door
then he becomes aware of another living presence in the boathouse
it is a slow breathing sound completely inhuman
there is no answer but the breathing continues
then a sharp rapping sound very near like a foot striking the wood flooring
we hear in the darkness the sound of his switchblade clicking open
and then he waits straining his ears to hear
finally skip reaches into his pocket puils out his lighter and flicks it on
something snags him from behind
skip gasps helpless as a thick rope controlled by powerful shadowed hands tightens around his neck
his knife dried leaves and lighter cascade to the floor
only the porch light remains glowing
the house is dark
rob wakes hearing the cry from muffs room
kit naked against him wakes too
they hear the muffled cry again
it is not from lovemaking
rob throws off the covers
rob wraps himself with a towel stepping quickly out to muffys door
everything else is dark and quiet
hushed at door muffy
he tries her door but its locked tight
then rob cont
he pulls back from the door
reluctantly puzzled ok
he turns back for his room catching sight of chaz who has come out of nikkis room to investigate too
harvey is out on the second floor balcony exercising vigorously
no one else is in evidence until a bedroom window flies open and nikki naked from the waist up and believing herself unwatched leans out and stretches breathing in the
sweet morning air
then she sees harvey grinning at her
she quickly covers herself and pulls back inside
rob and kit are the first ones down
they enter from the dining room surprising muffy at the stove
muffy turns abruptly startled
rob and kit stop abruptly too
muffy is barefooted dressed in an old worn chenille robe
her hair normally carefully groomed is unkempt wild and stringy about her pale face
talk about unguarded moments
her present appearance is the last way one would ever expect to find muffy st
she shrinks back from them with a frightened apologetic smile
scrambled eggs bubble in the skillet on the burner
i was hungry
she bumps against the stove backing away
she self consciously runs a hand through her hair
i must look a mess
she scuttles out the door to the utility room and the back stairs beyond leaving the eggs to burn
arch encounters her too as he comes bounding down in his workout shorts
she backs away from him scurrying up the stairs
forgot to get dressed
arch enters joining his wonderment to rob and kits
who made her night
arch chaz harvey and nikki burst out the door in old clothes sweats shorts whatever an unlikely foursome for some informal soccer scrimmaging
always in search of more players wheres skip
that depends on what hes on
rob and kit cross their path heading down to the water in their swimsuits and overshirts
you gotta be kidding
teasingly an invitation nan
what about it
nan watches from the porch book in hand
oh no thanks
besides i thought id wait and see what muffy wanted to do
arch shrugs and the soccer free for all begins in earnest with special attention given to the interplay between harvey and nikki
up on the porch nan finally sees muffy emerging from the distant tool shed
muffy is dressed plainly oddly conventional with a perceptible sense of disorder about her
she keeps to herself turning toward the woods beyond with cutting blade and mushroom basket in hand
nan puts down her book hurrying off the porch
but by the timeshe looks up again muffy is gone
rob and kit are standing together on the dock
he is dripping wet and covered with goose flesh
she has not been in yet
and while he is vigorously toweling off his arms and chest trying to get the blood circulating again she stands behind him with another towel and gently lovingly dries his
she finishes and he steps away from her and gazes out across the sound
i swear it wasnt this cold yesterday
this isnt what she meant and he knows it
are you giving up
turning to her gently what about you
what about your future
youre the one with the four point
maybe its crazy you investing so much energy in me
i dont know
i dont know if i want what mom and everybody else expects of me
i dont want to go to law school
youve got a great mind only its not made up
smiling sadly he crosses to her puts his arms around her
do you realize how perfectly unmatched we are
its made up about one thing though
she looks up and kisses him softly
will you feel the same about me a year from now
two years five years from now
she takes his hand and leads him down the pier and into the boathouse
as they come inside
kit closes the door and immediately they are in each others arms
the surging waves swirl beneath them visible through the shrunken floorboards
rob and kit stretch out
all the passion all the tenderness all the intensity makes them oblivious to the fact that something is moving on the water below
and when kit finally opens her eyes to it skips face bulges gruesomely up at her through the slatted floor
kit screams and scrambles to her feet rob completely uncomprehending until he sees it too skips body pale and bloodied draped within the grungy skiff passing beneath them on the
by the time he pulls on his swimsuit and comes rushing out with kit however robs shock has turned to rage
but theres no response skips body unmoving on the self powered skiff which continues bobbing out to sea
starts to wonder whether it really is a joke
he hurries forward plunging into the water to reach the boat
but its too far and getting farther and the waves are too strong
rob and kit come struggling up the path
chaz trains his videopak on them from the porch
he arch harvey and nikki unwind with beer and sandwiches after their sweaty workout
commentary while he tapes respectable young quaker couple returning after quiet afternoon of nonviolent sex
well how was it
anybody seen him
who wants to know
goddammit cant you give me a straight answer
they sit up with the force
nan comes out on the porch hearing
we saw him
on a boat
drifting by the pier
he wasnt movinq
he looked dead
unless he was joking
well if it was skip
i saw his face
has anybody seen him since last night
they all realize they havent
rob turns rushing into the house
rob stops as he notices near the foot of the stairs where hed parked it upon first entering the house yesterday afternoon skips overnight bag
he turns and bounds up the stairs
rob runs down to skips door and flings it open
a cheap rubber hobgoblin drops suddenly in front of him suspended from the ceiling on frail metal springs
rob jumps back with a startled cry then angrily tears the thing out of his way and throws it down
this is the last of muffys little april fools gags and as with the overnight bag it signifies that skip has been nowhere near this room
but rob steps inside and looks around just to make sure
the room is untouched the bed unslept in
rob hurries out as muffy finally appears emerging from the wooded grounds basketful of mushrooms in hand
noticing their distress something wrong
rob rushes by her
ill go with you
as rob arch and chaz come running down to the water
they stop and look around seeing nothing
aloud for skip hey asshole
wait a minute
look at this
he has found on the little pebbled beach beside the dock skips switchblade
it is in pieces
theres blood on the broken blade
this was skips
what do you think
that guy on the ferry
i dont know
i dont know what to think
i say we go looking for him him or skip
one of thems bound to still be around
you mean split up
lets not take any chances
he was pretty big
no suckers taken me yet
he rips a loose board off the dock for a club
in the gathering twilight muffy puts the basket of mushrooms away on a shelf
someone grabs her wrist
nan steps from the shadows
i know why youre avoiding me
i guess its your idea of a joke
thats why you invited me
howd you find out
from one of his preppy friends
who else have you told
who else knows except the father
dont know what youre talking about
the tape just got there
you know very well
she comes apart in tears
muffy stares uncomprehending
i thought you wanted to be friends
you think you can play with peoples feelings just because youre rich and can do what you want
well you cant
she rushes out the rear door
muffy tries to recover confused
she continues on to the back entrance to the kitchen
swinging open the door she almost runs into harvey
i was just checkin to make sure everybody was all right
he beats a hasty retreat the other way passing nikki on her way in nikki raises an eyebrow at muffy misinterpreting the tension in the air
maybe that explains your clothes
what dyou mean
muffy exits hurriedly upset
the path is narrow and tortuous
arch uses his club to clear the way trying to follow its twists and turns
he also tries to make vocal contact
he moves deeper and deeper into the forest
up ahead on the pathway a thick black viper slithers out of the undergrowth stops sensing archs presence and coils itself against his approach
as arch stalks forward not looking at the ground
arch steps right over the snake and continues on
as arch hears a noise
someone else is here with him very nearby
he turns and moves back along the trail peering into the dense foliage on either side
as he steps over the snake again going back the other way
he stops again looks all around him then turns once more and starts to move very slowly with short little steps back in the other direction
he is edging closer and closer to the snake
he is bound to step on it this time
the snake coils itself to strike
archs foot comes down just missing it less than six inches away when suddenly the ground seems to move
a noose springs up tightens around his ankle and arch is lifted into the air upside down swinging wildly dropping his club
now the viper strikes and arch sees it
he is shrieking with horror as he tries to bat the creature away from him
but he keeps swinging into it and the snake keeps striking at him trying to find an opening
suddenly a long gleaming blade enters frame and chops the snake in two
arch looks up his face white and frozen into a mask of sheer terror no longer able even to scream kit nikki and harvey are waiting on the back porch
when rob emerges from the woods nearby
calling to him no skip
chaz now comes out of the woods on the other side of the yard
he isnt with you
i dont like this
i definitely dont think i like this
i think its about time we called the police
the screen door bangs again
they look up
she returns their stares stiffly without expression
she holds flowers cut with hand shears
eight two four eight
constable potter has an office at his home
i dont think we should wait any longer
rob moves into the house past muffy
kit follows him
muffy to be played like muffy who wants some tea
itll calm our nerves
she exits toward the kitchen
perplexed by her behavior looks strangely after her
nan sits alone on a stone bench beside a small buddha statue in a secluded corner of the garden behind the house
she has been weeping
her face tells the story
now a gentle wind springs up rustling the leaves of the thick bushes surrounding her
she looks up
rob is on the phone trying to reach the constable
he hangs up the receiver then lifts it and starts to dial again
kit standing beside him
now wanders silently off into the dining room
as kit enters muffy comes in from the pantry breathless and apologetic her hands full of tea boxes
i didnt know what kind anybody would like so i just
got them all
let me help
has he reached the constable
no we haven t been able to get through to the mainland yet
kit turns the tap to fill the kettle
the pipes begin to bang
the tap sputters and coughs out a spurt of brown water before running dry
its probably broken
nikki and harvey enter having heard the pipes banging
it happens sometime
but theres still the well all the island homes have some kind of pump
nikki reaches for a large flashlight beam
just point me in the right direction
not without me
harvey accompanies nikki out the back door leaving kit and muffy alone again
bearing up under kits stare im not worried
im sure those two
skip and art
theyre just up to some kind of stupid trick
kit moves out of the kitchen uneasily
nikki milkes ghost sound following harvey out through the dark
it makes him nervous
i dont think you should really do that
is that it
the well is the old fashioned kind
boy when she said well she really meant well
who dug this thing
she reaches for the wooden bucket attached by metal nook to the thick rope
harvey pre empts
here let me do it
ive probably had more experience than you
you mean back home on the farm
i know you think im a hick but id like to change your mind about that if youd only give me the chance
because id really like to plow your field
draw me some water
hes glad to oblige opening the hinged wood well cover and lowering the bucket slowly
the dark hole seems to go on forever
suddenly theres a muffled clatter deep within the well
i lost the bucket
the rope was rotten any fool coulda seen that
here shine your light down so i can get a fix on it
she rises on her toes flashing the powerful beam down the dank hole
harvey bends over to look
a rotted piece of the well cover breaks off in his hand
he lurches forward
he slams back in ashen horror
im a big girl now
i think i can handle a few spiders and she shines the beam down again bending in for a look
she shouldve listened to him
nans body lies twisted and jammed among the slime
her dress is torn revealing a white breast with veins of blood streaming across it and into the water
next to her archs severed head gapes up in a rictus grin joined in its leer by skips decapitated head
its like the very guts have been torn out of her
she screams stumbling back
as rob runs up everyone else is already there
what is it
you dont want to know
in the well
oh god the well
rob grabs the flashlight from chazs hands and leaps up to take a look
after a long horrifying glimpse he has to step back to control his overwhelming nausea
he shudders violently
we have to leave all of us we have to get away
closing the well cover we cant get away
everyone back into the house
looking in through the windows we can see rob alone in the living room still trying the phone
panning across to the dining room windows we see nikki seated at the table with kit and chaz on either side of her
harvey stands behind them against the wall
kit is trying to comfort nikki who is still in shock
its okay nikki
with the others
they were outdoors
but were inside now and were safe
its all because of what happened on the ferry isnt it
it was an accident
dont they know that
muffy enters from the kitchen with a glass of water
harvey pulls her quietly aside
muffy where do you keep your guns
we dont keep guns in this house
the others turn and look back at them
there is an uncomfortable pause
handing nikki the glass here
not the water
its all right
suddenly the phone rings o
they all look toward the living room
as rob snatches up the receiver
he listens for a moment then almost collapses with relief
thank god its you
the others stand and start drifting in from the dining room
constable potter is calling from a pay phone near the reception desk
he listens for a moment then
what are you talking about
that aint possible
and im telling you im here at the hospital now visiting buck
he came out of surgery last night it might interest you to know hell be all right and cals been here too the whole time
angle widens to reveal the ferryman cal standing anxiously beside him
rob looks like hes just been clubbed on the back of the head
shes all right
what do you mean
he looks up at the others who have gathered around him expectantly
yes all right
he hangs up
anything but jubilant hes on his way
were supposed to wait here
to stay together
what about the ferryman
it isnt him
theyve been together all day
i dont understand
they look at each other ominously
i dont either
hes going to send up a flare as hes nearing the dock
then were to go down as a group to meet him there
in the meantime
we just wait
he goes out of the living room
rob bolts and double locks the front door
he also fastens the chain just for good measure
chaz and nikki secure all the doors and windows to the outside
kit enters checks and locks the windows
she turns on the lamp
on the desk prominently displayed and catching her eye a framed it is a black and white picture probably muffy as a child
but whats confusing is theres another little girl next to her in the picture who looks just like muffy too
she glances at the walls for more pictures
muffy enters suddenly interrupting her
kit startles turning
they face each other
its my fathers study
i just came in to make sure everything was secure to lock the windows
with the tides
it can take someone all night to get here from the mainland
and even then sometimes they dont make it
harvey is unlocking his suitcase which is back up on the bed
he reaches in and pulls out a small revolver
he drops the cylinder checking to see that its loaded then snaps it back in place
he tucks the weapon into the waistband at the small of his back then slips on his navy blazer
no one is around and no one has been down here since earlier in the day when muffy apparently brought down the painting with the vacant eye holes from outsid
rob and kits bedroom
camera pans off the painting now hung on a blank wall to the transcan window which is still propped open to the outside
chaz nikki kit and harvey are here trying to wait it out
peering out the window whats taking him so long
quietly without conviction it could be the tides
wait a minute
arent we supposed to be staying together
wherere muffy and rob
robs checking the back of the house
shes been acting less than normal anyway
picking up on it what do you mean
you mean all day and you havent noticed
well who isnt
and those nurses shoes
what nurses shoes
the clodhoppers shes been wearing today
its as though some common nerve of suspicion has been touched
they all stir
she was arguing with nan in the hall before you and rob
before you came back alone
they turn full attention on him
about something nan found in her room
something about an abortion
they all pause
i found somethin g in my room too she reaches into her bag and pulls out the black rubber bondage hood
only i dont think it was intended for me
to chaz defending nikki and what did you find
i didnt find anything
were supposed to believe that
i spent the night with nikki
what about you
what about me
whats your little secret
i dont know what youre talking about
oh come on sport
i walked in on you last night and you were acting like your ass was on fire
it wasnt anything
just some clippings
of some car accidents
nothing personal in that i suppose
who hasnt been in a car accident
its a common thing
there is a slight pause
rob comes into the living room holding a flashlight and stands just inside the doorway
the others shift uncomfortably
what id like to know is how did muffy find out about these things and why
just stop it all of you
what is wrong with us
nhat happened to all our talk about friendship and undying loyalty
looking from one to the other do you know what were saying
that were actually sitting here discussing the possibility that muffy a generous friend has invited us all here to she stops suddenly freezing in mid sentence and they all turn
following the direction of her look to see muffy standing in the entryway behind rob
im going upstairs
we should all stay together
this is my house
ill be in my room
she turns and heads up the stairs
shes got a point
were starting to get on each others nerves
as long as we all stay within shouting distance of each other
he joins her and they quietly head for the stairs
im goinq to find the way up to the attic
im sure we can watch for the constable better from up there
its all right
i can keep watch on the stairs
rob ho ds out his hand to her
she takes it and they walk together toward the stairs
muffy enters closes the door quietly and locks it behind her
she crosses to her bed slowly sits down and loses herself in troubled thought about everything that is going on
harvey steps up to the halfway landing and sits down
he looks above looks below then opens a magazine and begins thumbing through it
nikkis suitcase is open on the bed and she is moving nervously about the room gathering her things and cramming them into it
nikki come on
what do you mean nikki come on
dont give me any of this nikki come on
what are you doing
look stay if you like
lock your door
dig a trench
but once i leave this place im never coming back
she walks out the door and chaz follows her to
they cross the hall
catching up to her were all supposed to stay together here
yeah thats been real effective
she goes into
and starts to collect all her stuff from in here
chaz comes in behind her
so what are you going to do
just waltz on down to the pier
check your bag with the porter
then wait for an ocean liner to happen by and pick you up
is that it
pushing past him i cant stay here any longer
she goes back out into the hallway
as they cross back to nikkis bedroom
what if the constable never even comes
then ill swim all the way back to the mainland
i can be strong if i have to
as they re enter
look just relax three people are dead and youre telling me to relax
nikki now just hold on a minute and look at me
look at me
she stops and looks at him
now am i nervous
maybe even a little bit scared
am i running around like a chicken with its head cut off
i mean come on babe
lighten up a little huh
he quickly slips the s m mask over his head clowning around
look at this
what me worry
very funny chaz
youve got to look on the bright side of things
everythingll be all right
dont be a jerk
now im turning you on
take that thing off
i kind of like it in here
moving blindly toward her kiss me you savage she devil
get out of here
she pushes him and he falls backward across the bed
ooooh stop it some more
i love it when youre rough
she turns and goes out of the room again
chaz remains lying across the bed
course it would help a little if i could breathe in here
for when things start to get really passionate
camera frames the open bedroom window for a beat
the curtains luff slightly in response to a gentle breeze wafting in
nikki comes down the hall with some more clothes on her arm
she arrives at her door opens it she had not closed it the last time she went out and goes inside
chaz is still lying across the bed as last seen except that now his hands cover his crotch
real subtle chaz
she continues packing moving around the room
now im supposed to throw off my clothes and jump on you
just wind her up and watch her go
youve got a lot to learn buddy
chaz lies perfectly still
not even his chest appears to be moving
looking at his crotch again what is this
show and tell
ill show you mine if you show me yours
well forget it
you may as well just stick it back in your pants
say something goddammit
she swats his hands away from his crotch
beneath them on his pants is a slowly growing blood stain
nikki gasps her mouth contorting into a scream that will not come
she turns suddenly in response to
a noise o
and sees a dark figure stepping out from behind the slowly closing bedroom door
it is almost pitch black
there is the sound of a lightswitch being flicked on and off
suddenly a flashlight beam pierces the darkness and rob and kit can now be seen ascending the stairs to the attic
as they arrive at the top
rob sweeps the one large room with her flashlight
piles of old furniture are stacked here and there covered with grimy sheets
no ones been up here in years
rob crosses to the garret windows overlooking the sound
can you see him
there must not be a light on the boat
hes chosen not to use it
he said something else on the phone about muffy
he said not to trust anybody
thats why we were to stay together
no one was to be left alone with anyone else
then he said especially not with muffy
so thats why you let her go upstairs
thats why i let her go
what did he mean by that
i dont know
he wouldnt explain it
but thats ridiculous
hes known her longer than we have
he sweeps the flashlight back toward the stairs
rob wait a minute
she takes the flashlight from him and aims it on something near the door the barbie and ken dolls from the previous nights dinner
its just the dolls
shes been up here
she moves toward them while rob stays by the windows looking out
as she gets closer to the dolls however kit realizes that they have not just been stuck there haphazardly
rob comes over to join her as we cut to of the dolls as the flashlight moves across them slowly revealing them one by one
the last to be seen are a barbie and the heads of two kens stuck in a bowl of water
rob and klt staring at them frightened and astonished
its arch and skip and nan
he takes the flashlight from her and reveals two more a barbie and a ken lying next to each other with no clothes on both of them splattered with bright
red nail polish
what are these other two
suddenly the room is flooded with light
rob turns sharply and sees outside the window the constables flare hanging in the night sky
there is a pistol shot from downstairs
he jumps to his feet grabs hold of her hand and pulls her with him out of the attic
as they come racing down from the attic
rob heads for the main staircase
while kit runs down the hall to nikkis room and flings open the door
she isnt there
kit backs into the hallway
she can hear rob moving about calling for harvey but up here all is quiet and threatening
she hurries silently down to chaz room opens the door and steps inside
it is dark again in here but the video camera is still operating
kit closes the door behind her and leans forward barely whispering
she turns on the light and sees the bed both beds they are drenched in blood
kit reaches for the doorknob
it comes off in her hand
shes frantically pounding on the door and trying to jam the doorknob back in to get it to work
theres a noise outside the window
she turns aghast
suddenly the door flies open
i cant find hal he stops in mid sentence as he sees the beds
kit is already through the door
rob follows her out
rob is running with her toward the stairs
rob what about muffy
shes my friend
she breaks away from him and dashes down to muffys door
rob has no choice but to follow her
she tries the door but its locked
pulling her away lets go
rounding the corner to the shadowy back stairs rob suddenly bumps into something someone there
he screams aloud dropping his flashlight
it is harvey
his body dangles from the rafters high above the top of the rear stairs a thick rope around his neck
now rob has become unnerved and it is kits turn to take the lead
and they head back toward the main staircase
the flarelight wanes
constable potter looks up anxiously
soon he will be waiting in darkness
unlike the previous nights scene now there are no outdoor lights on here
rob and kit burst out of the dining room as if the house were on fire
kit stops to pull the doors shut behind them
yanking her away forget the doors
within moments they have crossed the back yard and disappeared into the brush leading down to the water
the night is a landscape of terror
as rob and kit race through the darkness the forest seems to fold in on top of them completely enclosing them within itself
they arrive at the waters edge and slow down abruptly
though they can see potters boat rocking gently in the water moored to the dock they cannot make out any sign of the constable
in guarded approach constable
the silence is chilling
they proceed out onto the dock
they come to the boat
if theres another flare we can signal him
maybe he went on to the house
rob unlashes the mooring grabbing hold of the line to pull the boat in
it wont budge the line snagged in the water where it dips in
rob tugs harder freeing something to the surface
it is constable potter his body turning once before sinking again under its tethered weights
an animal cries out behind them
rob wastes no more time pulling the rope and the boat quickly toward them
they jump in
there is a flashlight in the toolbox
rob grabs it shining it onto the controls
but theres no key in the ignition and no other way to start it
kit meanwhile picks up the letter thats lying on the bottom of the boat
she presses it into his hands
he shines the flashlight
its waterstained but still legible
the letterhead reads state hospital for the criminally insane and it is dated march addressed to potter and reads
pursuant to our previous communication please be advised that the patient under discussion has still not been found and returned to custody and it now believed to be attempting to
return to her home in your jurisdiction
if encountered exercise extreme caution and notify us immediately as miss st
john has been a patient here for three years and is still considered incorrigibly unstable and extremely dangerous
kit looks up frantic
whats it talking about
muffy hasnt been in any state mental institution for the last three years shes been at vassar
i dont know
but weve gotta get this boat started
didnt muffy say there was another key back in the kitchen
weve got no choice
rob i really dont want to go back there
neither one is making the move to go
id have you stay here but no
listen kit well get out of here i promise you
weve been through so much together
she has started to cry softly
it isnt going to end here
he kisses her
brief pause then he turns to go
they move slowly off the dock
rob and kit move up to the shrubbery skirting the back lawn and gaze across at the house
it is completely dark within and remains wrapped in silence as before
theyve been closed
sure enough the doors they come out by minutes ago the ones they didnt stop to close are now shut tight
they move stealthily through the bushes around to the side of the house
he is pointing toward the open basement window across a thirty foot space of clear lawn
thats how were going in
kit swallows hard
are you with me
they break from their cover and run keeping low to the side of the house
rob peers through the window into the darkness inside pushes the transom all the way open and then drags himself through on his belly
he drops to the floor turning to give kit a hand
she enters the same dusting herself off next to him
rob turns on the flashlight using it cautiously
moving through darkness the stairs
where are the stairs
they pause hearing dripping sounds in the darkness comi ng from the depths of the utility room
rob leads the way cautiously toward the sound
the flashlight cuts through the dark revealing the tap dripping in the tub
before the tub was clean
now however stubborn crimson stains smear the basin like blood that has refused to be washed away
other stains darken the floor
kits eyes widen in growing horrow
rob turns the beam toward the stains that track across the floor following them
the trail leads out of the utility room to the large cast iron incinerator
rob steps forward slowly opening its door angling the beam inside
inside muffys characteristic attire the clothes we saw her wearing yesterday after their arrival lie stuffed inside bloodied and charred
i dont get it
the beam momentarily sweeps the wall next to kit
she sees something
an urgent whisper rob
she gets him to turn the beam back to the wall where she is
she helps train it on what she saw
it is a growth chart that has been marked in ink faded over the years
there are growth measurements for muffy
and for a child named buffy
with similar heights on similar dates
she gasps finally connecting it
he doesnt yet understand
the picture of the girls in the study
what the constable was trying to tell you
its not muffy its her twin sister buffy
she has a twin sister
robs eyes have a glazed look
they are fixed somewhere else
rob dont you see
she follows his look and sees on the wall near the growth chart that he has trained his flashlight beam on the eyeless portrait from the night before
only now there are real eyes behind the painting rob
he casts about for a weapon coming up with a length of lead pipe
pull it away
too frightened to move rob
pull it away
they advance together on the painting rob keeping his flashlight on the eyes the entire time
kit slowly reaces out lifts the painting from the wall and drops it jumping back
just as muffys head rolls forward from a shelf behind the painting right into kits lap
kit screams as she bobbles the head in her hands like a hot potato trying to get rid of it
suddenly a loud noise slams at the basement window
rob grabs kit covering her mouth and snapping off
the head falls to the
floor at their feet
just in time to see the window they entered being nailed shut from the outside
all else they can make out are buffys hands and her tell tale nurse shoes
then these two move of sight around the outside of the house
rob clicks on the beam in the direction they went and sees the stairs
they race to them up them the door to the pantry is not locked
it gives way under robs pressure
kit scrambles up behind him
they can hear buffy outside in the yard approaching the kitchen door
rob and kit hurry in
rob searches frantically for the key board
the boat key
its gotta be here
his flashlight sweeps the walls of shelves
suddenly buffy is at the kitchen door
though the door in locked theres no bolt or chain to fully secure it
the knob rattles furiously under buffys grip the door shudders
rob spots a walk in cupboard
he hurries to it
kit gropes along the shelves searching the objects hanging along the distant wall
a long ugly looking knife blade slips in through the crack in the door
buffy is using it to try to pry open the door
rob opens the door
his beam falls on the key board on the inner wall
i he steps in following his beam into the darkness
the cupboard door slams shut behind him
he turns trapped
the door springs open
kit spins crying out as she sees the shadowed figure of buffy barefooted disheveled in a smock dagger in hand
she advances breathing heavily
stumbles back desperately
rob is desperately trying to break out but the door wont open
let me out
let me out of here
he is kicking the door hurling himself at the door but all to no effect
he barely has room to maneuver
kit turns to robs voice takes a step toward the cupboard but suddenly buffy is there cutting her off
kit backes away into the dining room
run kit run
kit reels back under buffys steady advance
kit cant see her clearly in the dim light but she can make out beneath buffys wild stringy dangling hair the madness the likeness of muffy the familiar face somehow
twisted by hate and madness into a stiff hideous unnatural deformation
buffy closes in readying the long greedy knife
rob still struggling knows kit is about to die
i love you
cornered helpless kit stumbles back toward the closed double doors that lead to the living room
please we didnt mean any harm
we just want to go home
buffy raises the dagger in hand
no longer trying to escape
for all hes worth kit
i love you
i love you kit
a mans hand reaches out from the side lightly touching robs shoulder
rob jumps turning
it is buck standing practically right beside him staring at rob
his face is the same bloody hideous mess it was the day before after the accident
i love you too babe
rob swings at him but only succeeds in smashing his knuckles against the door
buck grabs him and violently plants a kiss on his cheek
kit slams back against the double doors nowhere to go
and buffy strikes
the knife jabs into the door close to kits head
kit gasps momentarily spared
she pushes apart the double doors and stumbles back into
all the lights are on and when kit takes her eyes off buffy long enough to find out why she discovers everyone is here skip chaz nikki arch harvey nan
even the constable and the ferryman
they sit or casually stand quietly talking or reading magazines taking no notice of her whatsoever
rob is screaming uncontrollably
buck calmly peels all the blood and gore right off his face and slaps in onto rob
rob keeps screaming
then buck reaches out and unlatches the door
it was right there the whole time
kit is totally bewildered
then she looks back at buffy who steps into the living room and smiling holds up the knife and plunges it into her own hand
the blade is retractable
wrought with emotion oh fuck you
fuck you you guys
suddenly everyone in the room comes to life roaring with laughter
rob stumbles out of the cupboard bucks gory make up still stuck to his face
still frightened and confused rob hasnt put it together yet
he runs out of the kitchen
through the dining room and into the living room where he stops dead cold upon seeing everybody
the group laughs louder at the sight of him
buck walks up behind rob and claps him on the shoulder
rob jumps and screams involuntarily
the group laughs louder still
muffy is wiping off the last of her buffy make up
you guys are really terrific
i love you all
and i thank you from the bottom of my heart for being such good sports
he sits or rather lands on the sofa next to kit
rob you and kit you two were the best
you figured it all out
the clues really worked
whats this all about
and dont anyone say april fools or ill smack them in the teeth
how about if i told you it was the script for a weekend special thats going to help me keep this house
rob and kit stare mystified
look next month i get the house as part of my inheritance its true but only if i can show my father that it can carry itself
what with taxes and expenses
otherwise hell just sell it out of the family
so im planning on turning it into a country inn
not just another stuffy old run of the mill country inn but one that specializes in offering once in a lifetime whodunit weekends
i needed a rehearsal
i had to try out the idea on somebody
and you guys played along
dont look at me
we all got sucked in just as bad as you
once they were killed off yes
everybody had to cooperate
otherwise none of it would have worked
so i guess theres no crazy twin sister buffy
oh theres a crazy twin all right but his name isnt buffy
muffy smiles directing attention toward cousin skip
hes your brother
you bastard you were in on the whole deal too
only the set up
muffy told me to say i was her cousin and to pull that prank on the ferry
i had no idea what was going to happen with buck
make up artist par excellence from hollywood
buck reaches down and tosses archs decapitated head to him
arch bobbles the head nervously
the others laugh
just some old props i redressed with the help of photographs muffy sent me
it sure fooled me
so what castle are you going to inherit
well first hes got to prove he can manage his own allowance
to the constable which means i guess that youre no constable either
kit graham meet my uncle frank st
john of st
john et freres wall street
uncle frank smiles and waves at kit but harvey steps right over to him and starts pumping his hand
harvey hal edison jr
pleased to meet you sir
usually we dont even see uncle frank in the summer hes so busy
but this time he made an exception
i havent had this much fun since my hasty pudding show sophomore year at harvard
god lowe you kids
howd i do
i never did no acting before
boy was i shaking
cals our regular ferryman between the mainland and the islands around here
but i thought he was up to the dramatic challenge
well thats it
now you know it all
we have been had
youre lucky you didnt get yourself killed
i almost did with harvey
and who could know there would be a snake out in the woods with arch
but with the paying guests theyll know what theyre in for and the scenario wont be nearly so extreme
otherwise even lloyds of london wont cover you
and i regret that well some of those fake clues i planted in the bedrooms i guess were taken too seriously
im sorry about that
she avoids looking at nan so as not to draw attention to her
but we had fun didnt we
i mean come on
she starts passing
out chilled champagne bottles to the men to open and setting up glasses on a sideboard
i know ill never forget this weekend for as long as i live
youre telling me
man when i was swinging around out there in the woods i nearly crapped my pants
what do you mean nearly
i was there remember
arch turns red
you browned your trousers
its all right arch
theyll be out of the dryer soon
suddenly everyone roars with laughter
champagne corks start popping and before you know it the scene is resembling the locker room of the winning team of a championship series
spirits are high
friendships rekindled and the spread is incredible
muffy enters with a fresh basket of piping hot biscuits
only nikki harvey and cal are not present
just what we need
another country inn
well if the foods any indication its already half way there
pass the toxic wastes please
uncle frank frowns at skip as cal enters
john island bar harbor ferry leaves in thirty minutes
no stragglers please
rob and kit are the first ones in busing their dishes
boy what a difference being alive makes
i dont care what columbia says about you
is this the road to med school
i think it is
im going to try
he takes her by the hand and gazes at her
but if i make it or not no matter what happens well be together
you and me
if thats what you want
thats what i want
muffy enters with a stack of dishes followed by nan who quietly sets her plate on the counter and leaves
i dont know
too much champagne
they hear a muffled cry
as harvey finishes plowing her field
they lie still for a moment
dont tell me that was something you learned on the farm
uncle frank is hugging muffy
they are alone out here
ill make a full and glowing report to your father tomorrow so he can draw up the deed along with the other trust papers for wednesdays signing
im so proud of you
i wish i could say the same about your brother
oh uncle frank hes been a great help this weekend really
let me get him out here so you can ive already spoken with him
the screen door opens and rob steps out onto the porch
he comes over to them but does not butt into their conversation and uncle frank just keeps going as if rob werent even there
uncle frank cont
his conduct and his academic performance remain inexcusable
he knows your father cant be expected to entrust him with anything until he shows some signs of responsibility and initiative
embarrassed to be overhearing excuse me
he turns and walks back into the house
a horn honking
the van and the old pickup are idling out front
uncle frank is honking on the van horn
cal is alone behind the wheel of the pickup
skip walks casually up to the van then pointedly turns away and heads over to the pickup instead
uncle frank scowls
rob and kit come out the door and stop beside muffy
well i hate to say it i still ought to kill you but thanks
see you back there
if time is money were losing a fortune
nikki now runs out followed closely by harvey
they say their quick farewells and move along to the waiting vehicles
harvey discreetly opts to ride in the pickup while nikki climbs aboard the van passing chaz who just glares at her
finally nan comes out of the house
with a curt nod to muffy she heads on toward the van when
she hurries to catch up with her
let me say again how sorry i am
it wasnt intended
and now all is forgiven
i played along didnt i
whats done is done
ive learned a lot muffy i really have
i suppose i should say thank you but i dont think i would be able to without it sounding false
so ill just say goodbye
beat an afterthought thanks for showing me your house
she turns and crosses to the van and climbs aboard
the others callout their last goodbyes
muffy waves and then they are gone and muffy turns and walks forlornly back into her house
cal and uncle frank are the first ones onto the ferry
cal i want to thank you personally
youve been a real sport about this
aw it was fun
i know youve had your eye on that p ace ever since we were kids
and im sure we could make a deal with you
i know you havent been spending your money on anything else all these years
this time it just isnt in the cards
its still in the family
yes thats the way
he moves on
others are passing them now
chaz stops and wags his finger at cal
this time no funny business
muffy stand overlooking the mess
not knowing exactly where to begin she starts emptying ashtrays into each other then just stops
she walks out of the living room and through the entry hall and slowly climbs the stairs
from far away the ferry can be seen chugging away slowly returning to the mainland
closer now we can see whats happening on board
rob and skip lean against the rail and talk quietly
kit and arch and buck sit together and chat
chaz sits alone and nikki sits apart from him also alone
nan is up front gazing out over the bow while harvey stands beside her trying to make conversation
finally he gives up and strolls to the back of the craft pointedly passing nikki
he alights next to uncle frank who has his briefcase open on his lap
now nikki stands and goes and sits down next to chaz
im okay now thanks
chaz im sorry
what do we mean to each other anyway
more than this a couple of days ago
a couple of days ago
a couple of days ago i was a great young budding filmmaker who was going to turn pornography into high art
today im just a stupid college kid with a toy camera and about as much idea as where hes going as
he gives up
dont be down
ill tell you what ive learned from all this
im tired of having one fling after another
i dont want any more of that
i want a boyfriend
will you be my boyfriend
he looks at her slowly softening
yes he will
rob turns away from skip now steps over and surveys the quiet group
some party huh
you know what i thinks weird
how when we thought buck here got hurt because of skips prank and when things started happening and we thought maybe some of us were getting killed how we all
just kind of naturally accepted the fact that it was oh yeah sure because of the prank
whatre you talking about
well its like pranks really piss people off
it unleashes things you know
makes any kind of behavior possible and we accept it
when anything g
oes everything goes
what really amazes me is how easy we made it for her
everyone was just out for himself
we couldve stopped muffy cold if wed only stuck together if wed only worked like a team
yeah she really got us good
well i know what id do if i wasnt her brother
almost without thinking go back and give her a taste of her own medicine thats what we should do
leeks up hearing herself
skip returns the stare
shrugs smiling did i say anything
the others look at each other a beat registering
go back and scare the shit outta her for a change
she sure wouldnt be expecting it
well i dont know
i got a stack o books this high
stepping into the fray harveys right
to them all look whatre you talking about
weve had our fun
now we got work to do
at least for me anyway
well i kinda like the idea and i dont have work to get back to
she squares her shoulders
looks up in surprise kit
muffy can dish it out
it might be interesting to see if she can take it
a real catfight
open mouthed at her i dont believe you
just because youve decided to get serious about your life doesnt mean the rest of us cant have our fun whoops turning buck got any spare professional tricks you could
throw our way
buck looks up confused only now plugging in
so how many does that make us
much as id like to
no i dont think so thank you
nikki continues count
rob makes it easy for her
he meets kits stare squarely giving her time to change her mind
but kit smiles back victorious
one of the four outasight
cal we want to get back to the island
you just left i know
well not in this
but you might find something around after we dock
the big ferry drifts into the slip and the passengers begin to disembark
the phone on the bedstand rings
muffy answers it on the second ring
skip is talking on a pay phone
hi its me
grumpily stirring whatd you forget now
just calling to tell you the partys not over
the clean ups going to take clara and me at least a week
no i mean some of the gangs planning on coming back to give you some of your own medicine
does a bear shit in the woods
hey theyre your friends
that wouldnt be very sporting if i told you would it
rob and kit and nikki and chaz
well uncle frank told me about his recommendations
so i didnt want you to think there were any hard feelings
oh skip you dope
you know daddyll come around just as soon as you decide to buckle down
anyway dont let the bastards eat you up
ill try not to act too surprised when they arrive
i love you sis
you too goofball
skip hangs up
i beg your pardon
angle widens to include arch who has been standing beside skip the entire time
it was even your idea
a petty consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds
john blood is thicker than water thats what you mean
dont you know
old money sticks together
arch goes to his car and drives away
at some distance harvey is chasing down uncle frank as the latter closes in on his mercedes sedan
well can i look you up in a couple of months
maybe you could arrange a job interview for me
reaches into his pocket heres my card
thank you sir
thanks a lot
i sure appreciate it and its been a real pleasure meeting you
but uncle frank is already in the car and starting it up
harvey looks down at the card
it reads simply franklin st
john et freres
hey wait a minute
theres no phone number here
uncle frank is driving away
he speeds past skip who is walking down the road further along
he doesnt even stop for his own nephew
harvey kicks the dirt angrily
behind him a horn toots
harvey turns and scowls at nan who would like to get past
he steps aside and she peels away but she stops for skip
they exchange a few words
then he climbs into the front seat beside her and she drives off
now harvey is alone
he looks around for a beat then tosses the card away and moves toward his car
rob and chaz are trudging along
what the fuck was he talking about anyway
we might find something around after we dock
they walk out onto a private peer and eye the boats moored there
what the fuck do you think he was talking about
what are you two doing down there
rob and chaz look o
in response to the voice
well now weve been identified
its getting late
what a great idea this was
they round a bend and stop dead
in the distance kit and nikki are climbing into a boat
nikki sees them and waves
we got one
rob and chaz
i thought we looked there an hour ago
lets get this show on the road
he starts running to the boat
rob reluctantly follows
calling back to them did you find a key
howre we going to get the motor started
the house stands quiet the dying rays of sunlight reflected off the large bay windows overlooking the sound
as huddled together in a rowboat chaz nikki rob and kit arduously make their way back to the island
looking at the front door
someone is visible through the translucent glass pane coming up to the door
a knocking sound
the knocking continues
no sign of muffy
muffy finally emerges from the study crosses to the door and opens it
nikki walks in
nikki what on earth are you doing here
is something wrong
no no nothings wrong
chaz and i just figured there was nothing we had to get back to that couldnt wait and you could probably use a hand with the clean up
its our way of saying thank you
where is chaz
nikki is already moving into the living room
putting the boat up in the old boathouse
hell be up in a minute
nobody around and no sign of a boat
still and waiting muffy and nikki are seated across from each other
i wonder whats keeping chaz
he should have been up here by now
maybe he stopped to shit in the woods
you know chaz
im beginning to not like this
by the way where did you get the boat to come back here
oh cal gave us one
listen i need a drink of water
you just stay here
i can get it myself
she walks out of the living room
muffy looks after her and smiles to herself
as nikki enters
she doesnt turn on any lights but simply crosses to one of the kitchen windows and opens it
she gazes out into the night for a moment then backs out of the kitchen
pulling the swinging door closed behind her
she turns takes two steps toward the living room and stops remembering her water
she goes back to the kitchen door but suddenly it will not open for her
frustrated she heads back through the dining room but stops dead halfway across and turns slowly and looks back at the kitchen door
she goes out of the dining room
and walks up to the other door into the kitchen
it too its closed and will not yield
as nikki returns
what about your water
oh uh i drank it in there
muffy im really getting worried about chaz
i think we should go out and see whats happened
ill wait here
i dont want to go alone
im still scared from last night
please come with me
im sure chaz is fine
ill stay here by the phone just in case
its safer this way
do you want a flashlight
no thats okay
ill be fine
she strides out of the living room
as nikki comes out the front door and heads off into the woods
muffy sits quietly a moment thinking
then she gets up and goes toward the kitchen
she comes to the kitchen door pushes it open
muffy doesnt turn any lights on either
she goes to the sink sees that there is no used water glass then she notices the open window
she does get herself a bottle of perrier out of the fridge opens it pours it and walks back out of the kitchen leaving the window untouched
nikki stumbles through the darkness
suddenly she disappears from view with a loud splash
she comes up sputtering to the surface of a small forest pool she has fallen into
who dug the goddamn swimming pool
she drags herself out
she walks dripping wet into a clearing nearby where kit it making chaz up to look bloody and gruesome
we have to go to plan b
she wouldnt come out
doesnt she care about me
no one answers him
how do i look
a lot goddamn fucking better than i do
no one is here as rob pops his head up outside and slips in through the open window
he stops in the middle of the kitchen and listens
then he goes into
he creeps down the hall then turns and starts to tiptoe up the back stairs
camera dollies further down the hall to
just as nikki bursts in through the door
she stops suddenly
muffy isnt here
frustrated nikki runs back into
she looks around
she dashes into
and stops short
muffy is lying face down in a pool of blood
her throats been cut
the useless phone receiver is clutched in her hand making that constant phone company noise that lets you know the phone is off the hook
her throat gags a couple of times as if she is about to be sick
she turns and flies out of the room
the front door slams shut behind her
she runs into another clearing the camera has been here waiting for her where chaz is revealed lying on the ground looking much more hideous than muffy
chaz get up
he doesnt move
chaz stop playing around
she starts kicking him in the side
chaz doesnt stir but he does speak now without moving his lips
hissing pretending to be dead will you quit kicking me
its supposed to hurt
the games over
still not moving no
youre blowing the whole thing
muffy is dead
in the house
sitting up suddenly what
turning to the woods kit
kit come out
there is rustling o
then kit starts to emerge
whats going on
muffy is still lying face down as we saw her last
she hears footsteps going upstairs
rob is creeping up the attic stairs when he hears footsteps o
he pauses his face draining of color
as chaz nikki and kit come racing up to the door and run inside
as they come charging in
nothing left but the pool of blood and a thin trail of smeared drying blood to indicate that shes been dragged away
look shes been dragged away
somebodys still in this house
we could follow the trail
what about rob
she races out of the study
the three of them come clambering up the stairs kit in the lead
they turn a corner
then they see him
dead on the floor
they run over to him
dropping to her knees rob
shaking him wailing rob
dissolving into tears it was only a game
what the fuck is going on here
clutched in robs lifeless hand is a leather bookmark we may have noticed before
chaz slips it out from beneath his fingers
this was nans
suddenly there is a loud knock beneath them o
they all look up
someone is coming slowly up the stairs the loud footsteps o
that could only be made by a heavy boot thundering closer
kit and nikki and chaz huddle around robs body and await their approaching doom
suddenly a dark figure fills the doorframe at the top of the stairs
a hand with a knife is raised
chaz spies a lamp on the floor
he turns it on
muffy walks into the room lowering the knife
good job you guys
im really scared
the funs over rob
tears in her eyes muffy hes dead
somebody else is here
in this house
lets see if the dead are ticklish shall we
pulling her away screaming dont you touch him
okay okay take it easy
muffy its not a game anymore
just then there is a loud crash o
of glass breaking down on the first floor
after the slightest pause there is another crash o
someone is smashing in all the bay windows along the back porch
and she runs back down the attic stairs followed quickly by the others
as muffy bursts out of the stairway and into the hall
suddenly the door to the stairwell slams shut on nikki and chaz cutting them off
a key turns in the lock
muffy and kit turn back to see a male figure in the darkness whod been hiding behind the door
kit is nearest to him and without warning he lunges at her and buries a knife into her stomach up to the handle
kit screams and chokes trying to fight him off but he stabs her again and again and again plunging the knife deep into her with every thrust
hes killing me
hes killing me
muffy initially paralyzed with fear now runs for her life down the hallway down the stairs
and to the front door as kits screams o
fade to silence
muffy yanks on the door handle but the door will not open
she pulls again and again desperately but it wont budge she turns and runs out of the entry hall
just as she clears frame the front door swings silently open
muffy is racing past the back stairs toward the kitchen when a hand reaches out from the pantry and hooks her around the face
she is pulled backward screaming through the swinging door into the darkened pantry
it is skip
he pulls her head back exposing her throat
he raises a knife to it still stained with kits blood
its all over muffy
everythingll be mine
he makes a move to slit her throat when muffy kicks open the swinging door and sees
standing on the other side smiling in various states of fake blood and mess
rob kit nikki chaz and nan
muffys eyes pop out
skips hands relax
and the others burst out laughing
a sign being lifted into the air
it reads just another country inn proprietors st
john et frere pull back to see muffy supervising the raising of the sign in front of the house while skip drives up in the van bringing the first customers
to the door
