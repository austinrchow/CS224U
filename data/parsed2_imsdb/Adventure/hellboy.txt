by guillermo del toro in a photographic darkroom old optical enlargers porcelain trays timers and stills hanging out to dry
george matlin a slightly obese nearsighted man in his seventies
is he real
oh yeah absolutely
george matlin combat photographer
i havent talked about it for years you know
looks at the camera everyone called me crazy
matlin smiles as he paws through a box of old negatives
but i have the negative
someone turns on the darkrooms red safety light for an eerie dramatic effect
it all started back in
i was a corps photographer aboard an allied submarine
young matlins hands again paw through a bunch of negatives again under a red light
now at hes wedged in a submarine corridor a crowded maze of pipes and gauges
mm still cameras dangle from his neck
he shrinks back as a squad of marines hustles past him loading weapons
off the coast of scotland
whitman tough as nails pushes through his uniform soaked in sweat
we had an english civilian on board
not much older than me but already an advisor to president roosevelt
paranormal advisor i kid you not whitman continues down the passageway until he reaches a small
within an incongruously proper young englishman reading an ancient set of tarot cards
his name was trevor
profesor trevor broom
trevor broom bruttenholm is a gaunt olive skinned man in his late twenties
in his hands a tarot deck
he turns the cards face up the fool the moon
the sooner were done the better
broom grabs a worn down wooden box full of books and amulets
it has a leather strap that allows him to carry it much like a carpenters tool box
this is an important mission sgt
i hope you realize that
oh you dont wanna know what i think
he moves away
broom takes a small box and a few amulets
before exiting he pauses and tensely turns the last tarot super october scotland
its raining like hell now
soldiers move through a short tunnel carved into the mountain
whitman signals his men to spread out then comes alongside broom
may i have a word
impatient what is it
in private if you dont mind
they enter the remains of a small chapel
broom produces the small box
its full of rosaries
your men theyll need these whitman scowls and huffs
a life sized wooden christ contemplates the scene from above
you are a catholic
amongst other things yes but thats hardly the point
whitman locks and loads an automatic
youll need one of these
i abhor violence
whitman moves away sergeant whitman i hope you dont think me mad three days too late for that one professor
he moves away
broom looks up to the wooden christ it has no eyes
matlin hauls his tripod and gear and joins the troops on the move
broom catches up with whitman
youre wasting our time theres nothing on this island but sheep and rocks
the remains of trondham abbey
built on an intersection of ley lines the boundaries between our world and the other interrupts him what a load of crap
hell a week ago i hadnt even heard the word parabnormal paranormal whitman moves on but you read the transmission
nonsense german ghost stories
i have seen ghosts whitman
oh ill bet you have
reaching a slope matlin sets down his camera
turning he sees lights
drenched broom and whitman look down upon an impressive romanesque ruin
under worklights dozens of nazi soldiers swarm among thick stone walls and archways
they must be here for the sheep
a dozen german soldiers swiftly assemble a large steel machine
the work is monitored by a spindly nazi in black leather his face covered by an odd gas mask kroenen
the freak in the gas mask karl ruprecht kroenen one of the reichs top scientists
head of the thule occult society
he lowers a pair of binoculars and passes them to whitman
if hes here this is worse than i thought
to the radio man air and sea backup
the radioman cranks a transmitter to life
forty minutes away
we dont have forty minutes
kroenen throws a switch on the machine dozens of gears respond
steam pistons thrust copper rails upright lifting two mighty metal rings not unlike a gyroscope
kroenen grunts and signals for more floodlights to be turned on
the lights flood an ancient sacristy lined with eroded stone saints
grigory tall and gaunt stands naked arms fully extended
no matter what happens to me you must carry on with the work
ilsa a severe ageless aryan beauty reverentially drapes an embroidered robe over his bony shoulders
i will not leave you
yes you will
never he hands her a small leather bound book
it contains hand drawn notes and illustrations
this will guide you back to me
he pulls her close the clouds of their breath mingling
i grant you everlasting life youth and the power to serve me
he dips his fingers in a wooden bowl full of blood then wipes her tears away with a crimson thumb both a consolation and a ritual
von krupt an acrid german general wearing dark scarlet glasses and leather gloves appears
looks at his pocket watch
on the gold lid a swastika
grigory walks towards the machine its colossal steel and copper clockworks gleaming in the floodlights
five years of research and construction grigory
he strides alongside grigory and ilsa who holds an umbrella to shield her master from the pouring rain
the furhrer doesnt look kindly on failure
there will be no failure general
i promised herr hitler a miracle
ill deliver one
kroenen mutters excitedly as he opens a polished oak box containing a massive gold and copper mecha glove
grigory extends his hand so that kroenen may fit him with the contraption which is attached to cables and hoses
the americans fan out unseen
broom and whitman dive into a ditch barely in time to avoid a german foot patrol
other gis take up positions below a machine gun nest
grigory walks to the top of the altar cables trailing behind him
tonight we will open a portal and awaken the ogdru jahad the seven gods of chaos
beat our enemies will be destroyed
in an instant all impurity in this world will be razed and from the ashes a new eden will arise
he looks down at the machine and whispers ragnarok anung ia anung
he flexes his fingers and in response the two metal rings swing around the machines central axis
steam escapes from the ducts and pipes
an invisible blast of energy forces the falling rain to swerve momentarily away from grigorys body
ilsa signals two nazi scientists standing at a control panel
dont let the level drop
one of them inserts a inch solid gold cylinder into the machine
two openings remain vacant next to it
a blade of light opens in the air
burning symbols slash the air like living serpents of fire
the edges of the cosmic slit sizzle with color an alien galaxy sparkles on the other side
suddenly a work light tears loose and flies in
the six foot work light tumbles by the massive ogdru jahad seven egg like monoliths of unholy origin
within their translucent walls horrible creatures lie slumbering
as the light sweeps by one of the giants opens a filmy eye and then another and another and another
fleshy tentacles move lazily within their crystalline prison
grigory screams as his body rises
veins swell in his neck his face distorted by ecstasy and pain
someone shoots a photograph
its matlin snapping for all hes worth
whitman pulls him down and pulls out a large bayonet blade
listen to me you moron you do that again ill carve you a new too late
one of the nazi scientist has heard them
the nazi scientist approaches
pauses next to the box with the gold cylinders
fierce whisper to listen to me
the portal is open
we have to stop them
grigory dangles like a marionette in a new surge of energy
even the skeptical von krupt is in thrall
the nazi scientist reaches for a second gold cylinder
but something else lands next to him a grenade
the explosion blows him to pieces
in a few seconds the squad of allies storms the area
a hail of bullets cuts down a dozen nazis
the allies overrun the machine gun nest as grenades explode everywhere
von krupt shoots wildly hitting broom in the leg
but whitmans bullets rip into the old nazis chest
leaving a trail of blood broom crawls to a dead g
and grabs a grenade from his belt
kroenen extends two gleaming blades from twin steel bands on his wrists and takes on an entire group of soldiers mowing through them with swords spinning like deadly rotors
the steel chops clean through their weapons
broom pulls the pin and throws the grenade at the generator
it wedges itself between two moving tie rods
kroenen squeals and retracting his blades lunges after it
the gyrating rails slice through his leather jacket
as his fingers reach the grenade it explodes
kroenen flies through the air hitting a stone wall where two long pieces of shrapnel pin him like an insect
another rail plunges fffft
like a javelin into the earth right next to matlin
grigorys face is distorted pulled like ectoplasmic taffy his body contorting and breaking
the cosmic portal suddenly implodes
nothing is left but a few burnt rails and the metal glove empty and smoking
as the allies approach the fighting rages on
grigory and ilsa are gone
and for now so is kroenen
embedded in the wall where he was pinned two bloody rails nothing more
allied soldiers penetrate the ruins
matlin helps broom up
its almost over
he picks up a sample of white viscous goo from the outer rings of the smoking machine
cordon off the area
something came through
broom glances at a th century fresco depicting heaven and hell
a group of soldiers spreads out using flashlights to scour through the rubble
every one of them has a rosary hanging from the bayonet
broom hastily bandages his bleeding leg
matlin and whitman roam over the debris
rain pours through the broken roof
do you believe in hell
there is a place a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return
from there it infects our dreams
grigory gave us a glance tonight grigory thats russian right
broom nods thought they were on our side
grigory yefimovich rasputin cmon rasputin
spiritual advisor to the romanovs
beat in at a dinner in his honor he was poisoned shot stabbed clubbed drowned and castrated
that makes him more than a hundred a rustling sound reaches their ears
matlin readies a handgun as broom scans the walls with his flashlight
something moves accompanied by a loud scrape
matlin cocks his pistol and nervously approaches a crumbling statue
a red thing jumps into the air
instinctively matlin shoots at it
the red thing leaps from arch to arch followed by a trail of bullet hits
whitman and other soldiers join them to broom what the hell was that
it was red
what are you two talking about
a red ape
its not an ape they hear the labored breathing of a living creature
its got a big stone in its hand i think that is its hand
hissing the thing cowers between a gargoyle and a stone saint
whitman points his gun at the scarlet shape above
broom stops him from firing
wait in deep shadow the red thing observes with bright golden eyes veined with streaks of burnt sienna
broom slowly fishes a baby ruth candy bar from his pocket
peeling back the wrapper he slowly waves the candy
the red thing shrinks back
broom bites into the candy and chews noisily smacking his lips
offers the candy again
this time out of the dark comes a small face not very different from the stone demons around it
the creature extends its right arm its solid stone with tiny runes engraved around the thick cylindrical wrist
four articulated stone fingers wiggle reaching for the chocolate
wouldya look at the size of that whammer
whitman moves closer
on the wall behind him a shadow shows the red thing climbing into brooms arms
broom tenderly covers it with a blanket
the stubby fingers snatch the candy
its a boy
just a baby boy
the soldiers cluster around curious to see it
matlin prepares his camera and directs them into a group shot
broom smiles like a proud new father and embraces the creature patting him gently
best photo of my career and no one has ever seen it
they keep saying hes not real but i want to set the record straight before i go
matlin finally pulls an old x from a battered portfolio
he smiles full of memories
the real picture not the retouched one in life magazine
hands over the photograph this is him
the very same night we found him
the night broom gave him that name
beat can i say it on tv
he called him smiles at the creature inside the blanket hellboy blinks his bright golden eyes and chews candy his devilish red tail twitching happily
montage tabloid covers and news clippings screaming hellboy sighting in reno
tv newscasters read lurid copy
springer excerpts fist fight included feature the shows theme i was hellboys bride
some blurry grainy footage depicts hellboy crossing an alley
much like bigfoot in the woods
look at that
thats a costume
these people amaze me
manning is a balding official looking guy in a suit
with their conveniently blurry footage of their beloved hellboy
and they claim that he works for the fbi
manning on a tv show a la regis philbin
as the head of your division you you have seen dozens of pictures like this
exactly so why is it that theyre all out of focus
god knows people manage to get good pictures at a wedding
he shows a blurry picture
thats the alleged best man
the audience applauds
in the thick of a snowstorm three figures climb the icy steps of a massive rock formation
super birgau pass moldavia present day
the three figures move through a narrow passage until they reach a dead end
figure stops at a symbol carved in the rocky ground and consults grigorys leather bound book
the symbol matches an illustration in the book
before them a thick wall of ice
using a heavy steel hammer figure breaks through
i will guide you no further
figure produces two small gold ingots
hands one to the guide
keeps the other one
the guide examines his pay greedily engraved in it a the ice curtain collapses revealing a rough walled corridor
figure spots a glowing firefly
they follow it into a cathedral like vault that could easily hold a stadium
from an opening somewhere above eerie blue light streams down on a magnificent labyrinth
a few more fireflies speckle the air winking on and off
the three figures move past cyclopean statues guarding the inhuman architecture
the humans are dwarfed by the monumental scale of the walkways and ramparts
at the center of the labyrinth the stone floor is covered in grooves radiating from a shallow stone basin
figure uncovers his face hes a peasant guide
in romanian we shouldnt be here figure exchanges a meaningful look with figure
figure throws two solid gold pieces at the feet of the sherpa
on them an embossed swastika
after a greedy moment of thought the peasant kneels to pick up the gold
a long shiny blade pierces the peasants chest from behind
he blinks twice and slumps forward
figure steps out from behind him a long bloody blade in his hand
the figures uncover their faces
ilsa has not aged and kroenen still wears the same tight gas mask
he cleans his blade in the snow and takes back the gold
ilsa watches the sherpas blood as it runs in a steaming rivulet tracing a glyph in the grooves and filling the basin
a figure rises from the blood
a naked human shape haloed by fireflies
what did they do to your eyes
mechanized rollers transport x ray films over a backlit screen
a group of doctors studies the pictures and exchanges somber looks
rain spatters the windows
doctor glances at the others
have you told him yet
doctor looks through a glass partition at an aged but dignified broom who slowly buttons his shirt
hanging from his wrist his rosary
in the lungs
the spine liver
maybe six weeks
broom impassively takes in the information
i can arrange for hospitalization pain management
make the time more bearable broom pensively shuffles his tarot cards
shakes his head id rather
stay home you know
ill be making arrangements beat for my son
you can always get a second opinion
broom looks down first card off the deck death
that wont be necessary
leaves stir on the pavement
all the stores are decorated for halloween
two kids dressed as skeletons run in front of broom carrying a jack o lantern
leaning on a cane broom exits the building and walks toward a waiting black mercedes
the driver agent lime opens the door
broom pauses to buy a dozen baby ruth candy bars from a street vendor
in an electronics store a wall of tvs
the image of a red blurry shape hellboy fills the screens
seeing this son
mister manning what about the bureau for paranormal research and defense
the fbi has been known to conceal that word conceal from the american public phil phil hold your little green horses
let me tell you and the american public one thing this bureau for what was it
paranormal research and defense right well im here to clear up this once and for all
he looks at the camera there is no such thing
on a wooded new jersey hill a low slung high tech complex rests at the edge of a bluff its foundation fused with the rock below
a dolled up mod style moped stops at the massive gate
strapped to the luggage rack are two cheap suitcases
the driver a very wet young man named myers touches an old fashioned buzzer under a sign reading waste management a crackling intercom voice answers
shivering john myers f
transfer from quantico
a beat then whirrr
an eyepiece and an lcd screen scanner pop out
look at the birdie son
myers looks into the eyepiece
on the screen myers cornea is scanned
two violet flashes
his id and badge numbers appear
the gate opens
the moped putt putts towards the building in the distance
seated at a dramatic circular desk is a solitary guard
hello im late
five minutes late
yes i section fifty one
two steps back please
confused myers picks up his suitcases and complies
he realizes hes dead center on a giant b
logo a hand watch your hands and elbows
immediately the floor under myers feet starts down
hes on a small elevator
the panel overhead slides shut
a row of safety lights comes on
hes in a vast underground area with other elevators moving up and down in the distance
the elevator stops in a narrow dark space
neon lights flicker on illuminating a circular chamber
painted on the floor is a huge number
right in front of myers a magnificent oak door
myers knocks on it
myers looks around fascinated books
an office made of them
the soft glow of green shaded reading lamps bathes everything in an intimate warm light
one entire wall is a thick pane of glass the wall of a huge tank of water
a voice crackles through an intercom next to the tank
turn the pages please
myers jumps then moves closer to the glass
if you dont mind
in the tank abe sapien a fish man glides in and out view
myers looks at four book stands facing the glass
each supports an open volume
he leans close to the glass peering intently
he is slender dolphin gray with dark patterns streaking his soft skin
bright blue eyes shine with intelligence
behind a thin wound like mouth gills are bubbling
points at the books these
youre reading these
through a side door broom enters
four books at once
every day as long as im here to turn the pages
smiles my names broom
professor trevor broom
myers extends his hand in greeting sir im bam
abe presses his webbed hand against the glass closes his eyes all three lids
abes voice surges from the speaker
agent john t
myers kansas city
t stands for thaddeus mothers older brother
scar on your chin happened when you were ten you still wonder if its ever going to fade away
how did it he
discovered alive in a secret chamber at st
trinians foundling hospital washington
points at a small piece of antique paper framed on the wall
they took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank
reads icthyo sapiens april
the day abraham lincoln died
hence abe sapien
broom uncovers a tray by the tank four greenish eggs
myers gags and reels back
rotten eggs a delicacy
abe loves them
abe smiles and takes a subaquatic bow gracefully nabbing the eggs as they float through the hatch
how does he know so much about me
abe possesses a unique frontal lobe
thats a word youll hear quite a bit around here
where am i exactly sir
as you entered the lobby there was an inscription on the desk yes
do you remember what it said
sighs in absentia luci tenebrae vinciunt
in the absence of light darkness prevails
for there are things that go bump in the night agent myers
smiles we are the ones who bump back
myers and broom walk down a corridor
the walls are lined with glass cases containing occult artifacts
myers eyes a mummified hand a clay golem a sumptuous pagan altar
hitler joins the thule society a group of german aristocrats obsessed with the occult
he points to an ancient broken lance
he acquires the spear of longinus which pierced the body of christ
he who holds it becomes invincible
he gestures at an ancient lance
next to it a silver and gold reliquary
hitlers power increases tenfold
they go through a series of pneumatic doors
in president roosevelt decides to fight back
the bureau for paranormal research and defense is born
workmen are replacing two of the doors
big dents from an oversized fist have deformed the inch thick metal plates
the occult war finally ends when adolf hitler dies
hitler died in
enigmatic smile did he now
they reach a final door
stainless steel like a bank vault
waiting there is agent clay a burly guy in a suit with a cartful of beef and mashed potatoes
a dinner pile at least feet high
agent myers this is agent clay
follow his lead
broom hands myers two baby ruth bars and walks away
youre not coming
broom signals no
i hand picked you from a roster of over seventy academy graduates
make me proud
the door closes behind him
theyre not speaking
professor broom had him grounded
you saw the fish man right
well come on in and meet the rest of the family
clay uses an odd shaped electronic key to unlock the door
three solenoid locks turn
two steel vertical pistons open up
clay pushes the cart into a solid concrete bunker windowless austere except for a few samurai suits of armor and weapons
dozens of cats wander around others are curled up on the furniture
there are zippos everywhere from every era
on a sofa made from the bed of a pickup truck is a heap of blankets and comic books
all in all a mega bachelor pad
sotto voce he gets fed six times a day
hes got a thing for cats
youll be his nanny his keeper his best friend
he never goes out unsupervised who
clay points at a torn comic book hellboy the uncanny
myers picks it up looks at the cover it shows hellboy in a u
uniform fighting a monstrous ape
myers watches amazed as a bright red tail waves in and out of a pool of light about ten feet away
one of the cats playfully paws at it
sotto voce youre kidding those comics they never got the eyes right
the voice is a deep baritone chesty and powerful
to clay sotto voce oh jesus
is real sotto voce yup
sixty years old by our count
but he doesnt age like we do think dog years hes barely out of his teens
myers gasps seeing a monumental figure in the shadows exercising with a lb
stainless steel dumbbell
crimson biceps like cooked hams
chomping an unlit cigar stub
whats with the hair clay
finally got those implants
agent clay blushes as he hides his scalp
itll fill in
where do you want your dinner red
by the couch
on a nearby pile of junked tv sets a loop of fleischer cartoons and home movies cycles endlessly
one subject appears over and over an attractive young woman with a pale face and raven black hair
whos the squirt
agent myers is your new liaison
got tired of me
ill be around red just back in the field
hellboy lets the dumbbell drop
instinctively myers jumps
i dont want him
manning says im too soft on you sotto voce nudging myers the candy
give him the candy
myers remembers hes holding the baby ruths
i i have these
realizing fathers back
clay nods still angry
well you did break out i wanted to see her
grunts its nobodys business
you got yourself on tv again

sotto to myers try not to stare
he hates when people stare
uh oh john
sotto staring at what
he files em
to fit in
hellboy finally enters the light
hes awe inspiring with chiseled features patterned red skin and deep set golden eyes
involuntarily myers recoils
in spite of himself myers is staring at the horn stumps
whatcha looking at john
oh n no i an alarm sounds and a red light blinks on the wall
myers looks around bewildered
to clay hey hey hey
theyre playing our song
were on the move
to myers cmon champ
youre taking me for a walk
an imposing four story structure all pillars and pediments
a halloween banner advertises magick the ancient power
super the machen library manhattan chaos near the entrance policemen tv reporters mounted loud protests from the reporters as a line of black sedan cars are waved through
the nypd has yet to issue a statement
weve got swat vans paramedics you name it
and now heres a garbage truck double take a garbage truck
trailing behind the cars a garbage truck
on its side a mirrored sign reads squeaky clean inc
waste management services
an agent is driving the truck with myers at his side
the crowd parts like the red sea for the garbage truck
dozens of faces are reflected in the trucks mirrored logo
a mounted policeman rides past the mirrored sides of the truck
the mounted policeman is visible as he rides by
the mirrors are see through
the back of the truck is a fully equipped crime lab crammed with hi tech gear and low tech talismans
abe fits a respirator over his face
it looks like a mechanized elizabethan collar
valves bubble and hiss as he inhales liquid through his mouth and out his gills
hellboy looks out onto the crowd
look at them ugly suckers blue
one sheet of glass between them and us
story of my life
i break it they see us happy halloween
no more hiding
i could be outside you mean outside
hellboy straps on a huge utility belt heavy with amulets rosaries horseshoes
from an ashtray he grabs a handful of stogie stubs
lights one puts the rest in a pouch
dont get psychic with me
nothing psychic about it
hellboy unlocks a steel box stenciled on its lid the good samaritan and extracts the meanest looking custom built double barrel blue finished handgun ever made
a veritable cannon
how am i ever gonna get a girl
i drive around in a garbage truck liz left us red
take the hint
hefting the gun we dont take hints
the garbage truck pulls into an interior courtyard and stops
fbi bprd teams spread through the area expelling uniformed cops and securing the doors
three agents quarry stone and moss close a gate sealing off the area
all areas secured
from a nearby roof agent lime signals all clear
into a handheld radio seal the doors
red and blue are coming in
the truck stops clay pulls a lever
myers watches as the dumpster loader hinges down like a drawbridge revealing hellboy and abe
okay boys lets synch up our locators
abe clay and hellboy activate lights on their belts
they beep and blink
hellboy starts walking
as bprd agents clear the area clay myers abe and hellboy march through the main lobby
on view various display cases
two banners flank the marble staircase
reading a report at nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped
six guards dead hold on hold on i thought we checked this place
fakes and reproductions
apparently not everything was fake
broom stands at the base of the marble staircase
surprised to see him father
myers observes as the red goliath sheepishly averts his gaze from that of the fragile old man
they approach an oversize set of brass doors
abe removes a leather glove from his hand
he spreads his webbed fingers on the door
he closes his three eyelids and concentrates
two agents arrive with a rolling munitions case
myers observes as hellboy opens it and looks over a potpourri of bullets of all colors and shapes
a th century statue was destroyed
saint dionysius the aeropagite
who wards off demons
smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator
the statue however was hollow reliquary a prison
the vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the list of avignon
of which we hold a copy
hellboy selects a clip full of bullets and a speed loader
wouldya look at this babies
made em myself
holy water silver shavings white oak the works
pulling his hand away behind this door
a dark entity evil ancient and hungry
abe quickly starts scanning a few leather bound volumes of ancient magic
lemme go in and say hi
as hellboy opens the big doors a flickering amber glow illuminates him
he steps inside
blue emergency lamps are on
the exhibits are destroyed piles of debris are burning
hellboy walks past a fallen display case
he moves around cautiously
a couple of large carvings and statues startle him
on the floor boots half chewed
bitten belts and shreds of uniforms and hats
whispers into radio blue it stinks in here finely aged roadkill
the sickening sound of snapping bones and mastication reaches his ears
hellboy reacts to a smell raises his eyes to discover a huge pale creature hangs from the ceiling chewing slowly
sammael equipped with powerful arms a head full of tentacles and two well muscled hind legs
most of its face is hidden but the jaws are shiny with blood
beat whatcha havin
six library guards raw
plus belts and boots
man youre gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out in earphone red i found something abe has found a small medieval engraving of sammael in one of the
theres not much here the entitys name is sammael the desolate one son of nergal sammael releases himself lands on the floor
part of the neck is exposed white slimy skin cracked like old marble and criss crossed with blue veins
hold it beat hey sammy whaddayasay we work this out
im not a great shot but raises his gun the samaritan here uses really big bullets so whadyasay we work this out
sammael stands and turns around crack kkk
his waist twists him degrees
screeching sammael leaps away
the high caliber ammo rips a few columns apart and finally catches sammael
the bullet goes through it and destroys a statue and a large window behind him
the monster squeals and goes down
with a rattling cough it grows still
thats all for you sammy
in earpiece red you need to hear the rest of the information hellboy turns away for a moment
puts his gun away like a gunslinger
nah hes taken care of
no listen this sammael the desolate one lord of the shadows son of nergal hound of resurrection see
i dont like that hound of resurrection
hellboy looks back at the corpse its gone
harbinger of pestilence seed of destruction skip to the end willya
how do i kill it
it doesnt say bammm
from out of nowhere sammael appears and swings an arm
hellboy crashes into the brass doors
the doors bulge and crack under hellboys impact
abe and broom backpedal fast
myers pulls out his gun and starts looking for another way in
broom observes this pleased
sammael lashes out with a massive punch
hellboy goes k kkrash
through six glass cabinets then hits a window falling two stories down landing sideways in an industrial garbage bin
hellboy fights to stay conscious
blood drips from his mouth child
hellboy looks up standing in the alley like an apparition is grigory in a black suit and overcoat his eyes shielded by pitch black sunglasses all grown up i see
hellboys in shock confused
that voice i sang the first lullaby you ever heard my child
i ushered you into this world
beat i alone know your true calling your true name
dont tell me its zeppo
hellboy catches sight of his big gun lying on the ground
he goes for it but bammm
sammael lands before him
i can see that youre still young and dont know your place
turns to sammael teach him
before hellboy can reach the weapon wshhhp
a foot tongue lashes out from sammaels mouth like a whip
its arm thick with yellow sacs billowing from its sides
it wraps around hellboys right arm
hellboy falls to the ground writhing grinding his teeth
the tongue squeezes and pulls
smoke pours from hellboys skin
myers appears at the end of the alley firing round after round into sammaels tongue
amber blood explodes in the air
the tongue recoils with an infernal hellboy manages to roll away
myers goes for hellboys gun
and grabs it
he takes cover behind the trash container
hellboy is there
what do you think youre doing
myers proudly shows him the gun
helping you i just no one ever helps me
its my job
he grabs his gun and tries to reload but his arm hurts too much
here he hands him the gun and a fresh clip
reaching into his belt hellboy extracts a vacuum sealed packet
throws it at myers then load this
in the packet a single bullet
its a tracking bullet
crack the pin
the tongue punches through the steel like a ramrod
again and again
hellboy and myers can barely dodge it
myers cracks a safety pin
the glass head on the bullet glows like a chemical flare
what the hell is that
hes looking at hellboys smoking arm
inside a bloody gash a big black stinger is gleaming
hellboy pulls it out then steps on it
it pops like a ripe grape
lemme go ask hellboy steps from behind the container
sammaels tongue instantly wraps around the guns muzzle
hellboy shoots repeatedly
his face lit weirdly green as the tracking bullet lodges within the gun
then the glowing bullet flies through the barrel and out towards sammael still in mid air
it hits him square in the chest an explosion of green goo
with a shriek the thing leaps over a wall
hellboy scrambles after it
on the empty sidewalk hellboy sees a trail of glowing goop
he hits full stride following it around a corner
myers lands a second later cradling his arm chasing after him
no what are you doing
sammael dashes by followed closely by hellboy running full tilt
a ten wheeler backs up effectively blocking their way
a few workers load pumpkin boxes in it
what the hell is that
without slowing down sammael jumps onto the trailer denting the roof then jumping off and into a crowded carnival area
a small carrousel and refreshment stand flank a pumpkin patch
full of curiosity sammael pauses a second to inspect a trick or treater dressed as a golden dragon
hellboy catapults himself onto the trailers roof
chorus whoa whoa whoa hellboy jumps and lands heavily on top of the drivers cab the driver is almost crushed under the steel
he screams showered by thousands of glass shards
myers is a few steps behind
into headset well hit the street in a minute
were heading towards civilians
he squeezes between the vehicle and the alley wall
the vendors are yelling at him
yeah yeah crazy costume uh
trick or treat
sammael runs past a group of trick or treaters and jumps straight into the street
cars swerve avoiding a collision as sammael lands on the opposite sidewalk
the trick or treaters scream
he too dives straight into the traffic as myers follows he runs into the road
and a x speeds straight at him
seeing this hellboy runs back and lands next to myers holds out his stone hand and stops the x dead in its tracks
the impact somersaults the car over them both
it lands with a thud on the street air bags exploding
myers almost faints
other cars stop tires squealing and horns blaring
a major traffic jam
are you okay
myers opens his eyes nods
he moves after sammael
hellboy follows the glowing goop into an adjacent alley
at the far end he sees a metal grate has been moved
he comes up to the opening then jumps in
he lands on a subway track
sammael is a few yards away
waiting for me sammy
a train horn blares
a headlight approaches
hellboy smiles and puts away his gun
uh oh between a rock and a hard place but sammael sprints towards it
aw crap sammael unhinges a long scythe like bone from his forearm then jumps at the front car smashing through glass and steel and raining sparks
landing inside with a roar
sammaels tongue punches through the doors as he races through one two passenger cars and out the rear of the train back onto the tracks
landing there safely
now the train hurtles at hellboy who grimaces and does his best he leaps but humpf
his legs rattle over the tracks
inches from the wheels he punches his stone hand through the steel floor and grabs a handhold
steam and sparks explode everywhere
the train driver grabs a fire extinguisher and starts slamming it against hellboys head
im on your side
he goes under
the train whizzes overhead grazing his horn stumps making sparks fly
after the train passes hellboy sits up forehead smoking
sammael is gone
a trail of goop is glowing
he follows it until it ends abruptly
he looks ahead no trace of sammael
then a fat drop of glowing goop hits his hand
aw i forgot he looks up
sammael hangs from the ceiling then drops
then the creature lifts hellboy in a ferocious bear hug
hellboy twists around and cracks open the jaws of the creature like king kong and the t rex
sammael staggers back and in an impossible maneuver re knits his jaws together
then he uses his bone scythe to tackle hellboy and tchakkkk
pin his shoulder down
a deep wound
sammaels mouth starts to open
hellboy looks at the sparking third rail a few feet away
sammaels tongue rears back a snake ready to strike
hellboy grabs the rail
an electrical discharge consumes both creatures and burns the frame like flashpaper
hellboy lets go his hand and body smoking
sammael very crispy is convulsing in a cloud of smoke
he grows still
wreathed in smoke hellboy shakes off the shock and uses a flame on his arm to light a cigar
puffs smoke kicks the body you werent
a huge traffic jam clogs the highway
the totalled x is being towed away
several tv crews interview witnesses
myers his arm freshly bandaged signs a police form
his radio beeps
hows your arm
my arm is fine
where are you
myers moves away from the police officers
sotto voce where are you
hellboy walks away from the smoking sammael carcass
i just fried stinky
tell father ill be home
he shouldnt wait up
wait wait you cant go anywhere i gotta go with you no no no its fine i do my job i take a break
dont do this listen to me tell me where you are myers
he turns off his belt locator and moves away into the darkness of the tunnel
in the foreground black light escapes from sammaels charred body
an abandoned shower room
a series of sinks and stalls lined with dirty white tile
a phonograph nearby plays wagner
kroenen stands next to it
ilsa is nearby a straight razor glinting in her hand
she stands over grigory his back to us lovingly shaving her masters scalp
she grabs two glass eyes from a table
places them in grigorys sockets his back to us as he turns a glass eye shifts lazily into position
he opens his hand in it the pale black light that escaped from sammaels body
he cradles it like a precious stone
smiling sammael has fulfilled his destiny
die in peace and be reborn again and again
he closes his fist
only seven more days to the eclipse grishka
rasputin stands his neck and shoulders rising engorged by moving flesh beneath his human skin
ilsa stares in fascination
the child will be there
and so will we all wont we
behind him in the darkness of a tunnel two sammael silhouettes appear
a sleek black limo drives past the crowd and stops outside
fbi agent tom manning emerges
manning and broom walk through the mess
a crew is cleaning up
the dead guards are carried out
every time the media get a look at him they come to me
im running out of lies trevor
i thought you liked being on tv
beat how many escapes
this year alone five
tom hes our guest not a prisoner
your guest happens to be six foot five bright red and is government funded
hes just going through a phase manning moistens and lights a fine cigar using a kitchen match
what do you think this is the brady bunch
freaks abe sapien listens while pacing the exhibition hall palm open
lowers his voice tense these freaks trevor they give me the creeps
and im not the only one
youre up for review
you and your petting zoo
i know where to find him
ill get him back
manning watches as abe finds a sharp dagger embedded in the floor
hey fishstick dont touch anything abe silences him
i need to touch it to see
the past the future whatever this object holds
eyes broom is he serious
dont worry about fingerprints
i never had any
abe holds the dagger in his hand turns to broom
they were over here professor
who was here
you mind sharing your mystic insights
broom examines the dagger a ragnarok symbol crowns the hilt
the dragon and swastika
show me abe
he solemnly extends his hand
as soon as abe takes it the room
hours earlier the place is intact
both abe and broom witness spectrally as a guard checks an alarm monitoring unit
hearing a ticking sound he shines his light into a dark corner no ones there
but after the guard moves on a spidery form emerges from the pool of shadows on the floor
its kroenen encased in shiny black latex from head to toe
on his chest a close fitting harness comprised of softly ticking gears
he approaches a glass case which holds an ancient wooden statue of an eastern orthodox saint
then on the glass a reflection ilsa
she uses her hammer to destroy the glass case
the alarm shrieks
warning lights come on
kroenen pulls out a double ended blade
it spins like a giant bone saw slicing across the statue
no apparent damage until crackkkkk
a diagonal line appears and the top half falls
kroenen reaches for a small crank embedded in his chest and winds himself up
ilsa reaches into a hollow portion in the wooden statue and removes a large reliquary jar containing golden sand
six guards hurry in
they point their flashlights and guns at kroenen
kroenen starts shaking as if in a seizure and readies two bullet tears into kroenens arm spewing forth an explosion of dust
the guards shoot again
kroenen maneuvers the steel deflecting the bullets which ricochet wildly and finally hit three of the guards
they fall silently to the floor
kroenen dispatches two more in a flurry of knives
the last guard raises his gun
dont something is clearly stopping him
his hand breaks twisted by an unseen force
the flesh on his neck pushes upwards held by an invisible force
he starts floating in mid air
the blinking lights of arriving police cars tint the windows red and amber
they outline a figure formerly submerged in shadows
he gestures with both hands as if holding an imaginary doll
his arm muscles twitch under his skin shifting changing gaining strength
with a quick gesture grigory twists the lower and upper parts of the guards body in opposite directions
with a wet crunch the guards shadow on the wall goes limp
grigory looks at ilsa
ready the welcome my love ilsa opens the reliquary jar and pours a circle of sand onto the floor
gathered from the tears of a thousand martyrs
restraining the essence of sammael the hell hound the seed of destruction
grigory slices the air with his open hand creating fleeting glyphs
and a small black flame dances on his open palm
he deposits it in mid air at the center of the circle
then the sand begins to move like liquid mercury
lines fuse into a pile
it melts and bubbles growing and foaming
bones are formed tendons and ligaments join together it roars
abe snaps out of it
broom is pale
he steps away wincing enduring a bolt of pain in his side
abe holds him
motions for the others to stay back
he extends his open palm and feels the air near the old mans back
you are very sick i dont want hellboy to know broom turns around gently pushes abes hand away
sixty years ago abe they tried to destroy the world
and they are back in my lifetime they are back
to finish the job
a small nighttime halloween celebration
lanterns hanging from the trees couples drinking and listening to pop music on picnic tables
on a bench a young guy pulls out a cold six pack of beer and passionately kisses his girlfriend
as he shuts his eyes a bright red tail neatly snatches the six pack
behind the bench hellboy smiles
dry leaves fly up in a gust of wind
a small army of emergency vehicles roars down the deserted streets right past a
brick s hospital behind a high wall topped with barbed wire
the mesh covered windows are decorated with paper skeletons and jack o lanterns
a topiary garden surrounds the building
watching from atop the wall is hellboy
one sleeve of his overcoat is soaked in blood
he keeps an eye on the second floor windows
hanging from his tail the six pack of beer
doctor marsh a female psychiatrist moves down a line patients distributing pills
behind her a lithe young woman in a patients gown carries the medicine tray
this is liz sherman age her pale skin contrasting with her raven black hair and piercing dark eyes
a scar mars her forehead
three thick rubber bands circle her wrist
near a window a downs syndrome patient senses something
pointing theres a big red guy down there
readying more pills thats fine darling santas not here for another month
big and red
with gold eyes
and he has beer
hearing this liz stops
she closes her eyes tugs at one of the rubber bands on her wrist and lets it snap against her skin
she winces and peers out the window
the garden below seems empty
liz steps out a side door into the hospital garden
hanging from her neck an old polaroid camera
she follows a trail of blood to a large thorny bush
as she circles it
back so soon
visible in the branches a leg and part of hellboys overcoat
his tail emerges dangling the six pack
uh i brought beer
liz shoots a polaroid
to wash down my lithium pills
beat i may get a few perks h
but im still a patient
shyly he climbs out from the bush
she sees the bloody arm
you better have that looked at
just a scratch
shrug i wanted to see you
hellboys sitting on a bench next to liz
we miss you at the bureau
abes crazier every day
and fathers still mad at me liz smiles come back liz
not this time h
its been months since ive had an episode
and you know what
im learning to control it
around her right hand a faint blue aura of fire blooms crawling over her fingers like a velvet haze
she stares at the pale flame
im learning where it comes from
beat and for once in my life im not afraid
she clenches her fist and puts the flame out
looks like your ride is here
the garbage truck and the two black sedan cars have pulled into the hospital grounds
a dozen agents climb out of the vehicles
the nanny squad
clay starts towards hellboy but myers stops him and turns to broom sir may i go first
to broom not so fast
he barely knows him cuts him off then he should make it his business to change that
liz stands up puts her hand on his shoulder
ive got a chance out here
if you truly care about me dont come back anymore
hellboy smiles sadly
she walks away
she doesnt turn back
yeah i gotta go too
lots to do feeling light headed he stands up
on the bench and at his feet a pool of his own blood
he sees myers tentatively approaching
what took you so long
cmon time to go home
tape you up
what are you a boy scout
i never was
weak couldve fooled me
hellboy drops to his knees
clay quarry and moss reach him
help him up
you look a little woozy there
this is nothing
you know whatll kill me
points at the doorway her
liz stands at the hospital door and sees hellboy keel over
a few of the agents help him to the vehicles
myers looks back at liz
they hold each others gaze their unfamiliar faces filled with curiosity
eventually she goes inside
in the depths of the b
d infirmary hellboy lies flat on a stainless steel table
broom sits alongside him
abe peers through a magnifier at hellboys wounded arm
you were burned by some organic acid
im lucky that way
using a scalpel abe probes the gash
hellboy lets out a son
about rasputin dont worry
ill get him soon enough listen to me
this time is different
theres more at stake than ever before
how hard can it be
i punched the crap out of that thing that he sent ouch
i worry about you
cmon well i wont be around forever you know
oh stop that grimaces in pain damn
be careful there red
how long was it latched onto you
i dunno maybe five seconds ow
you want me to hold him down
snickers thats right stud hold me down
broom moves to abes side of the table
abe is poking at the depths of the wound
sharp to hellboy dont look
is it bad
broom comes closer eyes wide inside the wound on hellboys forearm nestled like ticks are translucent eggs
hellboy jumps as abe plucks the first one out
abe deposits it in a glass container
touched you five seconds
laid three eggs
didnt even buy me a drink
the computer beeps having finished an analysis
on a monitor an enlarged color image of one of the throbbing eggs
the eggs are very sensitive to heat and light
they need a humid dark environment to breed
abe picks up an egg with a pair of tweezers passes it on to hellboy who sports a bandage on his arm
did you ever loose track of him
well lets see there was that moment when i had a train on top of my head broom frowns worried
to hellboy we cant risk it youll go back to the tracks tomorrow with a group of agents search the area top to bottom
myers observes repelled as inside the egg a small foetal thing wiggles
myers stands by brooms desk as the old man places a new set of books on the reading stands in front of the fish tank
im in way over my head i know that much
youre doing fine
at the last book stand broom glances at abe who is sitting in the shadows near the door
no im not
he respects clay
i dont know why you chose me sir
but im not qualified
discouraged myers heads for the door
very quiet im dying agent myers
shocked myers looks over at broom
and as a father i worry about him
directly to myers in medieval stories agent myers theres often a young knight inexperienced but pure of heart
im not pure of heart
yes you are
what i ask from you is have the courage to stand by his side after im gone
help him find himself
who he must be
beat he was born a demon
you will help him become a man
dozens of hellboy clippings flash by tabloid headlines along with intimate images of hellboy as a kid
at at dressed as a human for halloween broom by his side
myers works at a computer workstation
he brings up a small photograph in an old issue of the enquirer
the headline arson suspect now working for secret government agency theres a photo of a woman taken with a telephoto lens
another clipping young liz and a photo of a tenement building burned to the ground tragic explosion
a quicktime interview pops up
liz in her early twenties
a caption reads elizabeth sherman first interview bprd pyrokinetic
she has a polaroid camera in her hands
shoots one at the lens
i dont like the term firestarter
i just dont
and pyrokinesis sounds like psychosis or something
i dunno maybe thats right
not being able to let go shrug scary
sometimes you hear so and so lost control and just exploded
beat theyre lucky it isnt true
looks at the camera with me it is
two strolling orderlies shine their flashlights inside the rooms on both sides of a long corridor
a flashlight beam sweeps lizs room
it illuminates a corkboard covered with hundreds of polaroids depicting scenes of everyday life
when the beam of light crosses her face she turns slowly still asleep
as the light fades the shadows in the room grow deeper
grigory emerges from a dark corner
he gazes down on the bed extending his right hand
the master is calling your name now my girl
we are all part of his plan
you must return to the child
so once again
he gently caresses the scar on her forehead
under his skin a hideous movement a writhing rearrangement of muscles
his fingers start to glow
dream of fire
a small ripple of heat rises from her forehead
somewhere in a smokestack city grown ups and kids hang banners and prepare a ragged birthday party in a cement courtyard
sitting on some tenement steps liz age
sullen alone a gold crucifix hanging on her chest
a woman lizs mother comes down the courtyard steps carrying a basket of apples
to liz liz
come on darling give mummy a hand
nearby under a balloon archway munching candy coated apples
three kids giggle and point at her
liz turns to see them
to his friend see
she knows her name
liz shies away from them
go home you freak
we dont want you here
they start throwing stones
one hits the steps
another misses her by inches
a third hits her in the shoulder
scared liz turns but a rock catches her full on the face
she falls down blood trickling from her forehead splattering the pavement
she starts sobbing
another rock sails across but this time in mid air it catches fire and turns to ash
a ripple of heat starts crawling up lizs hands
soon a pale blue flame rings her entire arm
sobbing not again please not again
firelight glints off the crucifix
mother is dunking the apples in a pot of caramel
a heartbreaking cry reaches her ears
liz outlined by licking flames
mother screams horrified
she then explodes
a white hot supernova engulfs the courtyard
her mothers body burns like flash paper
then the rest of the people are devoured by an explosion of atomic proportions
benches people trees
the four surrounding apartment blocks collapse as a shock wave hits like a wrecking ball
the frame whites out
and at ground zero there is but one figure left standing liz
a little girl still crying
liz screams her back arching her body now in flames
her chest glows silhouetting organs and ribs
the rubber bands on her wrist vaporize
the glow from lizs room streams into the corridor
in their glass kiosk two orderlies are listening to the radio and sharing a pizza
a red light flashes repeatedly on a panel
they silence the radio grab their batons and get up
a low rumble shakes the room
through the vibrating glass window they see
a ball of flame pushing inexorably through the corridor
the inside of the glass booth is absolutely silent making the vision both terrifying and strangely serene
oh my as the glass explodes the fire roars drowning everything
the orderlies hit the floor taking cover under a shelf
the top floor blows up
flame pours out of every window showering glass into the streets below
myers pushes the breakfast cart
on it three dozen pancakes and a mound of bacon and toast
he opens the door to hellboy s den
inside hellboy is leaning over broom glaring at the old man
how many buildings does she have to burn
she belongs here
thats not how she feels
she may never feel it
myers enters deliberately clearing his throat
they ignore him
its her choice beat shes human oh as opposed to
broom grows silent
hellboy stomps over to a mirror and using a hand held belt sander savagely shaves his horns
sparks fly every time he goes at the round stumps
were going out professor that girl you were talking about whirls around hey
you think twice i think i can help talk to her i can bring her back
chuckles what landed you this job pushing pamcakes
what was your area of expertise
myers murmurs what was that
hellboys face lights up
part of the building is demolished
repair crews and firemen are still hosing down smoldering piles of debris
myers arrives in a taxi cab
myers looks at liz through a see through mirror
she sits on a bench inside a padded cell
a security camera and monitor records her constantly
a worried looking dr
marsh stands alongside him
shes been like this since it happened
there were no casualties
but its put a big dent in our thorazine supply
dubious look at myers are you sure you want to go in
myers nods loosens his tie and enters
liz doesnt acknowledge myers presence
he kneels and looks up at her
im agent myers fbi
liz turns away
im agent myers fbi
no response the hospital called us
they dont feel theyre capable of caring for you any longer and silence
liz can i call you liz
its a beautiful name sighs its still impressive by my standards my names john
she looks at him
he offers his hand
she looks away
broom asked me to invite you back to the bureau
no special precautions no security escorts
you and me in a taxi
like regular folks
doesnt sounds like him
miss sherman hes asking you back but its entirely your choice
liz turns to the way mirror
both their reflections are there
ive quit the bureau thirteen times
i always go back
snaps two rubber bands where else would i go
an explosion of sound and light as a subway train passes through a dank tunnel
then light beams sweep the encrusted walls and steel columns
clay and some b
agents hold flashlights
two of them moss and quarry carry flamethrowers
hellboy and abe bring up the rear
they enter a store room piled high with filing cabinets typewriters and school desks
a turn of the century mural depicts happy boys doing charitable acts
a latin phrase viriliter age encourages them to behave like men
reads a map were in the cellar of the benjamin institute
turn of the century orphanage
closed since they moved the sewers in
abe removes his gloves hyperextends his palm and senses the air
then the surface of the water
theres a pulse
and its coming from debris and dust seem to float from the waters surface and towards abes hand
there they point their flashlights at a bulkhead
cistern on the other side
most of the eggs are there they move some filing cabinets and stare at a blank concrete wall
no way in
we should go back and request permission to bammm
hellboys stone hand cracks the concrete
he starts pounding again and again like a jack hammer
makeshift living quarters tucked below a maze of furnace ducts
scores of old clocks fill the room with ticking
at a desk kroenen calmly repairs a mechanical hand his own
his face is partly exposed
under his leather mask horrible lidless eyes glitter over a skull like grin made of raw gums and taut skin
as hellboys pounding reaches his ears he rises like a spider whose web has twitched
the mechanical hand rattles blindly on the table
he opens an ancient leather folder and extracts an engraving depicting sammael
carefully places it on the table
then he opens a drawer and from an envelope takes two torn pieces of paper
he puts them in a pouch in his belt
the wall collapses under hellboys attack
are you coming or not
clay smiles uncertainly back
hellboy moves in
to quarry and moss you two check this dump then join us a large oval room of rusting metal with pipes spilling water through a large grate on the floor
abe studies it senses something and nods
with superhuman effort hellboy lifts it
hundreds of roaches pour out
im glad im not human
this place would be an embarrassment
below a vast cistern
abe drops in two chemical flares
the flares sink illuminating floating office furniture and torn paper
in the lower depths they pass shadowy industrial ruins
settling on the bottom they reveal the hulk of a waiting abe pulls off his breathing apparatus
activates the locator on his utility belt
hellboy does likewise
the devices synchronize
hellboy extends a metal reliquary containing a small bone
there you go doctor
this should cover your tailfin on loan from the vatican a bone from saint dionysius
looks like a pinky
abe ties the reliquary around his hand
remind me why i keep doing this
rotten eggs and the safety of mankind
oh right as transparent nictomembrane lids cover his eyes abe dives
underwater abe finds an entire control room
s magazines float by like paper jellyfish
the amber light of the chemical flares gives the room an eerie other worldly feel
waiting above hellboy chews a baby ruth and pokes around
finds a pile of childrens shoes covering some yellowing albums
in the albums a myriad of sad faces the orphans from the past
some of the faces have been cut out
theres an unfinished letter to father christmas dated
clay stands below a grate admiring his hair implants with a hand mirror
its not that doll hair thing suddenly something moves
hellboy shines his light into an adjoining tunnel
kroenen is standing there like a deer caught in headlights
son of a
the figure darts away
hellboy tears after it gun in hand
clay tries his radio
reds on the move
ill cover him
he pulls out his gun and runs after hellboy
clay arrives at an intersection of sewer tunnels
the glow of hellboys flashlight is visible somewhere ahead his booming footsteps rapidly receding
a veritable labyrinth
damn it red
abe nears the bottom of the cistern
as his feet touch bottom a cloud of silt fogs the water
he picks out a translucent egg
suddenly something big glides by
abe turns sees nothing
he places the egg in a glass canister
now eggs are floating everywhere undulating in the water like amber fireflies
abe swims slowly collecting them one by one
some of them are snugly wedged between two rusty machines
abes reliquary gets caught in a lever and snaps loose
it lands on a grate on the floor
abe swims down and tries to grab it but it falls through
abe curses and stands up only to find himself face to face with sammael
the monster rakes abe across the chest dark blue blood begins to flow
abe shoves himself into a long concrete fissure
sammael cant fit through but the tongue darts out missing abe by inches
sammael scratches at the walls trying to reach deeper screaming in rage
abe screams too emitting a trail of bubbles
the bubbles burst on the surface
watching them is a second hellboy stops disoriented
no trace of kroenen
he sniffs the air then steps through a non descript portal
hellboy stands in kroenens quarters
an array of gas masks dangle from ducts overhead
glued next to the walls are dozens of old photos of children
he discovers the sammael engraving
sammael seed of destruction
death becomes the fertile ground
suddenly drool drops from above sammael hangs from a beam
turning didnt i kill you already
sammael lunges hurling hellboy through an open service shaft
and its a long way down
when sammael leaps hellboy throws him over the edge
sammael however grabs hellboys tail and pulls him over the side
they crash through pipes wiring and ducts and slide off down a duct and into another passage
there they bounce off of dripping water pipes and jutting steel i beams until they finally break through a mesh insulation ceiling and directly onto a subway platform
full of people
the two fighting creatures land on the ticket booth in an explosion of coins glass and steel
some bold new yorker in the crowd start picking up handfuls of change
the dust clears revealing a large crater in the platform floor
sammael hits hellboy
the red giant lands on a line of turnstiles uprooting them all
sammael flies through the air unfolds its bone scythe
hellboy rolls away
sammael misses the tip imbeds itself in the floor and then tchakkk
in a concrete column
sammael pulls bringing down part of the ceiling
more screams from the fleeing public
a mezzanine above hellboy collapses bringing the ceiling steel cables and office furniture down onto the red giant
sammael takes a step towards the crowd and roars then bammmmmm
a desk flies up into the air
hellboys stone hand emerges triumphant
hey chunk face
he climbs out of the crater
you can do better than that
big monster like you
hellboy rips off one of the turnstile bars and hits sammael again and again
you shouldnt hit people
sammael blocks the last hit and throws the bar away
it embeds itself in the tile wall
sammael punches hellboy a hard uppercut
hellboy flies up crashing through the plate glass of a second mezzanine above the platform
he skids on the tile floor scraping a jagged line with his stone hand
he slides past a group of bystanders and into a row of backlit subway ads
he lands in a shower of glass and debris on a wooden bench breaking it in two
sammael climbs up into the mezzanine
hellboy gets up his back bristling with glass shards and hears a wail a young girl is pointing at a box of kittens abandoned on a bench
hellboy scoops up the box holds it high
using his bone blade sammael pulverizes the bench
next sammael slashes at hellboy scattering a dozen shrieking citizens
illuminated by sparks and shorting lamps hellboy advances blood dripping from his forehead and nose
hellboy starts to reload but sammaels tongue shoots out
hellboy throws the kitten box in the air and traps the tongue with his stone hand second date
while catching the box with his tail
the kittens are fine
using the tongue he throws sammael out a glass window
sammael dangles above the tracks but he re joints himself and grabs a handhold on the train wall above the tunnel
from here he pulls on hellboy sliding him toward the jagged glass
sammael pulls harder enters the tunnel
hellboy fights to free himself but his sweaty face is millimeters away from being sliced by the glass
all seems lost when
a train appears out of nowhere heading straight for sammael
it splatters the thing against the tunnel wall and plows on
sammaels body sprawls motionless at the side of the tracks
i hope that hurt
he gives the cats to the young girl thank you my job
hellboy approaches sammael whose remains are wreathed in black flame
a huge crowd looks on from the end of the platform
a whisper this time
stay dead willya
he moves away
the black flame flickers out
under the water black light blooms within two of sammaels eggs as a fantastic methamorphosis starts
the embryos burst out gyrating in the water swelling and distending
badly wounded abe peers from his hiding spot
sammaels not there
he quickly swims to the surface his weird blue blood trailing behind him
the water boils with energy and black light
abe staggers out of the pool and hides behind a crumbling shower stall
behind him two shapes come to the surface
shaking abe pushes his belt locator and collapses
hellboys locator belt crackles to life
back in the tunnel quarry and moss move filing cabinets and rotten bozes full of files
one of them gives out and papers spill all over
jesus their locators light up
abe suddenly a noise
the agents leap up and sweep their flashlights over the columns
moss what the hell was that
then two silhouettes cast long shadows
powerful footfalls boom like thunderclaps
agent quarry raises his gun and fires at the dark shapes
useless the things plow on
moss hurriedly straps on his flame thrower
after a few seconds a green light beeps ready
the muzzle of the flamethrower vomits a feet long gout of fire into the blackness
the men pause silence
quarry turns on his flashlight hand trembling
whatever it was bam
sammaels tongue uncurls from the shadows and lands on quarrys face pulling him into the dark
his flashlight bobbles and strobes lighting up a nightmare two sammaels stand in the tunnel
one of them gleefully squeezes quarry
the mans screams are muffled by the creatures fleshy lips wrapping around his head
moss runs as fast as he can jumping and tumbling through an obstacle course of beams
turning he readies the flamethrower
the second sammael lands on mosss back breaking his spine
hellboy enters to find abe bleeding but alive leaning against the tile blue blood all around him
hellboy tries his walkie talkie
turns on his locator
its damaged and broken
into his walkie talkie we need an ambulance
clay stumbles around lost
he stops under a grate
on the walkie talkie whos there
come in someone
clay code this is clay over
behind clay kroenen drops down from an overhead pipe through shafts of gray light
he brings forth his customary long blade
clay turns in time to see kroenen coming at him
twin rivulets of blood run from clays nostrils
hellboy hears the gunfire starts running
clay falls to the floor
kroenen stands there unfazed by clays bullets in his chest
dust pours from his wounds and piles up neatly at his feet
he hears hellboy coming
he places the knife on the floor then lies down and plays dead
hellboy appears at the end of the tunnel
he glances at kroenens body then quickly checks for a pulse on clay
hellboy looks demolished
an ethnic pop song blasts from the taxi radio
liz pokes her head out of the window and shoots a polaroid snapshot
she passes it to myers it feels good to be outside
its been so long
he cant hear her over the music
myers knocks on the bulletproof acrylic divider
turn down the music
yeah yeah music
he merely changes the radio station the music stays at the same volume
myers looks back at liz
she is halfway out the window sitting on the door
thats not thats not safe miss sherman miss sherman
she takes another polaroid and passes it down to him
myers looks at the polaroid then smiles
he climbs out of the other window hands her the photograph
nice view he waves at her
for the first time she smiles
a smile huh
she takes his picture
with the cold morning wind blowing lizs hair and the sun on her face she looks beautiful
dont get used to it
myers taps his fingers on the roof to the beat of the music
he cant take his eyes off her
they drive towards the bprd
unconscious abe floats in a special tank
led strips read water temperature ph level etc
hes encased in a bio cast a cybernetic healing unit wrapped around his thorax and right arm
a web of tubes and hoses keeps him in place
shirtless and bandaged hellboy sits and studies him as if in a trance
hell make it hellboy turns manning is there but not everyone was so lucky
beat two agents died today
clay probably wont survive the night
i knew those men better than you did ah i see
that makes it all alright then
he turns to leave
hellboy gets up
no it doesnt make it right but i stopped that creature didnt i
thats what you do
thats why we need you
you have an insight
beat you know monsters
what are you trying to say
in the end after youve killed and captured every freak out there theres still one left you
a deep sigh i wish i could be more gracious but bammmmm
he smashes a metal locker with his stone hand and raises it above his head
manning cowers realizing that hellboys rage is a dangerous thing
a new space
office corridors radiate out from a brass b
logo on the floor
a few agents monitor computer stations and tactical glass boards
liz and myers walk in carrying her suitcases
she looks around and sees broom coming down the hall
its only for the weekend professor broom
then ill be on my way impeccable courtesy come and go as you please
beat find your way back
weve made quite a few changes crash
liz screams and myers draws his gun
smashing through a glass partition the mangled steel locker lands in the middle of the hall in a rain of glass and aluminum studs
next manning appears retreating but unharmed
gasping i want that thing locked up starting now now
you hear me
to broom nothings changed
home sweet home
mortified broom hurries after manning
hellboy calmly steps through the hole in the wall
seeing her liz
she spins on her heel and walks off
hellboy turns to myers
you did it buddy myers holsters his gun and follows liz
hellboy is all alone now
oblivious woo hoo
a familiar cell
fireproof insulation covers the walls
liz throws her bags on the bed
myers lingers in the doorway
she reflexively pulls on one of the rubber bands on her wrist then lets it snap
a little something i learned in therapy
im depressed snaps a rubber band one rubber band
im impatient two rubber bands
he sits by her side on the bed
ill get you a fresh pack
a cat bats at a ball of paper
on it two words are visible dear liz
hellboys tail scoops up the paper and throws it in a brimming wastebasket
hes sitting at a stainless steel desk deep in concentration writing with evident difficulty
the floor around him is covered with more crumpled pages
in the background the projector is showing duck soup
myers pushes in a cartload of chili
where do you shh
just a second
myers sets the tray on the table
myers youre a talker
whats a good word a solid word for need need is a good solid word
nah sounds too needy
start in you got nachos coming
as he goes out liz appears in the doorway
hellboy quickly stops writing
notices the small feline army oh my god
look at them all
who had babies
liz plays with a cat
hellboy lifts the piece of paper which looks like a postage stamp in his stone hand
liz i theres something id like you to something i need you to hear
is it long
im going out but out
for a cup of coffee but go ahead read
youre going alone
myers is taking me
hellboy stands up walks towards her
why not me
myers walks back in pushing a tray of nachos
to hellboy hey your chilis getting cold sits back down not hungry
what did you want me to hear
hellboy folds the paper
just a list its not finished oh okay then
maybe later then
anything else you snappy not from you
well good n furious good night
under a sheet kroenens cold naked body lies on a slab
broom talks into a tape recorder
the subject karl ruprecht kroenen the visible areas of the body make us grateful for the sheet covering the rest
suffered a masochistic compulsion known as surgical addiction
the silver hand and harness lie on a table
both eyelids were surgically removed along with his upper and lower lips making speech impossible
the blood in his veins dried up decades ago
only dust remains
looks at an x ray film four pulverized vertebrae
a steel rod inserted into his pelvis held him up
beat what horrible will power could keep a thing like this alive
he finds the small pieces of paper kroenen planted in his pouch
under the gaze of high security cameras agent lime rolls hellboys food cart down the corridor and into the domed intersection
he whistles a happy tune
opens the high security door
limes jaw drops
across the room one of the walls has been completely demolished revealing a service shaft
no sign of hellboy
lime peeks into the service shaft
myers and liz leave a coffee shop strolling down the street
myers hands liz her coffee
they chat and laugh
he pushes his moped
she has her polaroid with her
what are you two talking about
whats so fascinating
liz and myers pause at a corner waiting for the light
the shops are closing
i admire him
hes a force of nature
hes just pushy
my uncle used to say
we like people for their qualities but love them for their defects
liz half smiles sips her coffee
he loves you
what about you
i grew up with him
beat ive missed him too but now every time i see him i get confused
hardly a day goes by hes not in my mind
even now i feel hes here as they walk down the street
a red streak jumps over roof tops
hellboy lands neatly on the adjacent roof
he looks down at myers and liz myers offers her cream and sugar
no cream and sugar moron
she takes it black
she takes the coffee waves off the half and half
trying to feel superior hellboy chuckles
as they walk liz gestures vigorously
his smile fades
its freezing isnt it
coffees warming me up
by now all the shops are closed
they approach a small park near a train track
what do we do now
newark new jersey entertainment capital of the world
she cleans off a wet dirty bench sits down
you offered me a cup of coffee
ive got one so just sit down
myers is falling for her
hellboy leaps off a building
two red hands appear over the rooftop parapet
cursing hellboy hauls himself up
he finds himself next to a pigeon coop where a young kid is feeding the birds
the kid stares at him
on a mission
he watches as liz and myers sit on the bench
dont tell anyone huh
broom examines the damage to the wall
he turns to see hellboys locator belt hanging on the wall
broom shakes his head
should we send out some scouts
broom motions for him to stop
its useless no
he will never change always a child
kroenens body lies on the table
slowly his chest starts to rise and fall
he sits up
his arm stump docks into the prosthetic hand click
he flexes the shiny fingers
kroenens hideous cranium is visible for an instant before he zips up his mask
he takes the sharp ragnarok knives and turns one over
it reflects a figure standing behind him grigory
the pigeon kid walks towards hellboy carrying two glasses of milk and a plate of cookies
my mom baked em
he sits by hellboys side as he watches liz and myers chatting and laughing
thats it shes laughing
hellboy grabs three cookies off the plate and scarfs them down
they dont look like spies
look at him those shifty eyes that phony grin
seeing the last cookie you gonna eat that
below myers yawns
hellboy slaps his forehead
oh the yawning trick
thats so s
watch his arm he looks around picks up a pebble hefts it
we all have a side that we try to hide
myers stretches and places his hand and arm behind her back
something hits him in the head
what the hell
he gets up annoyed
no one in sight
hellboy snickers hiding and chewing a cookie
the kid gives him five
kroenens two pieces of paper are joined together under a micro scanner
broom watches as computer enhancement fills out a couple of missing areas
cyrillic letters are now legible
pensive sebastian plackba
broom pulls out a few old photos
finds one of grigory in german uniform and in a book another of grigory in an orthodox priests black cassock
he pulls out his old wooden box pulls out a dusty book from it
his fingers scan the text finding rasputins date of birth date of death
they pause at a particular line his mausoleum is at sebastian plackba
its rasputins mausoleum
a noise broom turns in time to see kroenen delicately descending a spiral staircase blade in hand
in spite of all his experience broom is shaken
i see the puppet
but where is
the puppet master
in the dark a voice hisses very good professor broom
grigory steps from the shadows
it was you the scraps of paper lizs sudden relapse and return
nods bread crumbs on the trail
like in a fable
they both distract him and guide him exactly where i need him
he touches brooms forehead lightly you raised the child
so in return
would you permit me
a brief brief glimpse
of the future a nightmarish tableau
the ruins of new york charred smoldering
human remains litter the landscape
monstrous shapes lumber in the distance
an army of apocalyptic beasts outlined against the blood red sky
dominating the horror is a mountain of festering skeletons and skulls
at the top a figure hellboy transformed
his horns are in full bloom his eyes and mouth stream unearthly fire
startled broom snaps out of it if only you had him destroyed sixty years ago none of this would come to pass
but then how could you have known
broom is speechless
your god chooses to remain silent
mine lives within me
rasputin stands the flesh of his neck and shoulders heaving and twitching beneath his human skin
in the frozen waters of the malaya nevka in the darkness of the void every time i died and crossed over a little more of the master came back with
he disclosed to me the childs true name
would you like to know it
i know what to call him
nothing you can say or do will change that
i call him son
discreetly broom removes his rosary and places it on the book
kroenen settles in behind him
i am ready
now ill add two crumbs more kroenen displays his knives grief and revenge
kroenens knife goes in
the pigeons flutter on the rooftop
the pigeon kid sits by hellboys side
just go down there and tell her how you feel
hellboy shakes his head no my mom says its not that easy okay
beat plus youre nine
youre not old enough to give me advice
shrugs who are those guys
hellboy turns and sees two of the black b
sedan cars rounds the corner
agent lime bounds out of one of the vehicles grabbing myers talking rapidly
liz screams covers her ears
somethings wrong agents and bureau employees are crammed into brooms office doorway
hellboy face contorted by grief pushes through
the room is full of forensics people taking pictures picking up evidence etc
tom manning is there
seeing hellboy he respectfully steps back
brooms fragile body lies slumped in his chair
at his feet a pool of blood
liz enters then stifles a whimper
with tears in his eyes a disbelieving hellboy looks at liz then at his dead father
he holds brooms body close to his chest
father im back
manning herds everybody out
from the door liz blinks back tears as the red giant kneels by the body a dog with a lost master
i wasnt here
you died alone its raining like hell
the pallbearers manning and myers among them load brooms casket into a hearse
flanking it are two rows of bprd agents
the hearse doors close and the vehicle pulls away
watching like a gargoyle from a distant roof hellboy
rain bounces off his wet overcoat
liz observes him worried
he hasnt spoken to anyone in three days
not a word
he doesnt eat he doesnt sleep
abe conscious now but still in the cast floats upside down solving a rubiks cube
liz stands by the tank
ive never seen him like this
beat should i stay
with him i mean
she smiles faintly
listen im not much of a problem solver
displays the cube three decades and ive only gotten two sides
beat but i know this much if theres trouble all we have is each other
and im stuck here
beat so take care of the big monkey for me will you
their hands almost touch separated only by the glass
a projection screen shows the enhanced image of the piece of paper with cyrillic characters
weve collected and destroyed thousands of eggs
no trace of this sammael or this rasputin character
but we have this address in a meeting room manning stands at a polished obsidian desk
a group of agents myers among them listens attentively
volokolamsk fields fifty miles from moscow
we leave as soon as we get clearance and equipment hellboys coming beat but ill be in charge this time
either we wrap this up or im closing this freak show for good
myers spots liz walking past the conference room
hellboy stands before brooms desk pensive his naked chest bandaged
liz watches him from across the room
he finds brooms rosary on top of the book
reads the underlined phrase on the page
hi he turns to her
she slowly comes towards him
ive changed my mind
ill come to moscow
if you are still going hellboy nods then clears his throat
beat but i have something to say too
beat i never had the guts before he looks her in the eye
but i understand what you dont like about me
what i am makes you feel out of place out there red i listen
im not like myers
he makes you feel like you belong
and thats good
it really is
i wish i could do something about this points at his own face but i cant
beat i can promise you only two things
one ill always look this good
two i wont give up on you
i like that
super topockba steel mills moscow a wasteland of rust and decay
rotting warehouses line the street like dead steel watchdogs
no ones around but a few lonely sentries
a limo and motorcycle caravan are waved through the security gates
a metal door trundles back and the limo and escort motorcycles enter
fleshy russian general lapikov gets out of the limo
then ilsa and grigory
i have accumulated many objects of great interest
preserving our heritage
the warehouse contains a world of bric a brac a towering marble lenin head old master paintings tanks warheads missiles etc
many like me believe mother russia to be very close to a historic rebirth
they stop before a cargo container
with a butane torch a soldier melts away the lead kremlin seal then open the doors
i like that
a massive stone monolith of polished marble
twenty tons of stone
this thing fell from the sky into tungaska forest
it burned hundreds of square miles of forest
the romanovs took possession of it immediately
the czar guarded it jealously i have wanted it for ages
grigorys fingers brush over its smooth perfect surface
at the center two circular imprints that match hellboys four fingered stone hand
now finally its mine
you are aware of course theres no way youll get it out of russian territory
curtly he is aware
ilsa brings out a chrome box full of gold
its a pleasure doing business with you
perhaps you have other interests
grigorys voice drips with serene brutality
enjoy the bright metal youve earned
there will be no further transactions
beat only closure
a massive cargo plane slices the white eye of a full moon
a map details the planes journey over the black sea
super russian airspace black sea
as the plane engines drone myers supervises bprd agents lime and stone who stencil a large crate fragile
live hellboy and liz stand around a brightly lit work table
hellboy shows them the medieval illustration of sammael
one falls two shall arise
so you pop one two come out
you kill two you get four
you kill four youre in trouble
we have to nail em all at once
and the eggs
when we do no mumbo jumbo
double core vulcan grenades
manning shows them a set of grenade belts
weve installed a very handy timer
set it walk away
cable pulls the safety pins k boom
easy to clean easy to use
interrupts those things never work
each of us gets a belt
shrugs it off i wont take em
they never work
manning looks at hellboy irate
ill carry his hellboy wraps brooms rosary on his wrist
two gleaming black vans and a truck move through snow covered soviet roads
super volokolamsk fields moscow
myers and liz struggle with a moscow map
into a radio sparky to big red
popping her head out of the window liz looks back at the truck bed
fastened to it the crate labelled live cargo
small breathing holes have been drilled in the sides
who came up with that
were almost there
hellboy sitting on the floor in the dark
on radio were leaving the main road so hang on they hit a series of bumps
the box rattles and shakes
hellboy bangs his head
the vehicle lurches to a halt
on the radio this better be the place or ill puke
motors are turned off
the crate is opened
liz peeks in
come out and see
hellboy steps out
takes a moment to adjust his eyes to the light
broken spiked fences succumb to rust and dead vines
endless rows of crypts and tombstones poke through wild foliage
our group plus two agents lime and stone venture into the labyrinthine lanes of the dead
each carries a backpack a flashlight and a gun
the group gathers in frustration in an area of baroque funerary monuments
myers carrying the explosive belts looks around
this is practically a city
and it stinks and its muddy
well go back check into a hotel regroup after breakfast
well have to make a grid go by quadrants
maybe satellite photography
he gestures and all the agents head for the vans
let me ask for directions
the group surrounds a grave
hellboy raises the broken stone cover and then jumps in
and lands on a rotten coffin
in it a mummified corpse lies in a miserable black suit
whispers animam edere animus corpus
he presses the amulet on the cadavers forehead
for a moment nothing and then
a brutal spasm
the corpse gasps breathes
and mutters something in tongueless russian
subtitle what do you want
the group gawks as hellboy climbs out carrying the corpse on his back
with an ear to ear grin he approaches the team
sixty feet further comrades and three rows in
the corpse fidgets on hellboys back
its bony hand weakly points as if in confirmation
this here is ivan klimentovich say hi ivan
the corpse mutters again
subtitled go that way red monkey
a miniature black marble castle
using a crowbar myers pries open the ancient steel door
hellboy still carrying the desiccated abomination on his back walks in
two agents stand guard in the mausoleum while the group descends carefully
the walls are dotted with yellowed skulls
myers flashlight flickers
he shakes it back to life
they reach the bottom of the staircase three corridors branch off in different directions
hellboy deposits the corpse attop a pile of coffins
well be alright
as long as we dont separate tchkanggg
large spiked metal plates shoot up from below blocking both their way out demolishing the staircase and ramming stone hes gone
wicked spikes cover the metal surface
hellboy still bangs on it but to no avail its at least six inches thick
liz and myers are on the other side
into his walkie talkie okay someones expecting us
turn on your locators anyone sees anything
on the other side of the panel myers takes the radio from liz
into radio are you sure about this
on a scale of one to ten two
but beat shell take care of you myers
shes a tough one
liz and myers move off
hellboy shines his light down the tunnel on the left
agent lime picks up the corpse and follows
hellboy and manning come into a vast chamber slavic motifs crown the rugged stone pillars and archways
water runs down the walls
across a small stone bridge light pours from a hexagonal structure
they step onto the bridge
two gears release a steel door from above forcing them to forge ahead
somewhere a massive clockwork is ticking
whats that hellboy motions for silence
the corpse mutters its they stare into the darkness
we should go back you you could tear that door apart dont move
we should go back
dont im in charge
we go back
hellboy yanks manning just in time
a gigantic metal pendulum swings past and demolishes one third of the bridge a few feet from their feet
it takes lime and the corpse with it
another door on the far end of the bridge shudders downward
son of a whoosh
the pendulum swings back
it destroys more of the bridge
manning sprints for all hes worth and crawls under the door
hellboy runs but chunks of stone disintegrate under his feet
the pendulum swings back taking out the final piece of the bridge just as hellboy rolls under the door and makes it into the hexagonal building
hellboy and manning find themselves in a very narrow arched stone corridor
its walls are lined with endless rows of rusty steel blades
faint traces of wagner can be heard
they cautiously proceed
in yellow gaslight kroenen nods attentively as a phonograph plays the love duet from tristan und isolde
above him ropes hooks and pulleys
manning rest his hand too close to a blade
kroenen comes alert
he scans the room quietly winds himself up
hellboy shoots a dirty look at manning and then looks back into the chamber kroenen is gone
to manning crap
this guy moves like a cockroach hellboy readies his gun and then creeps toward the lab
hellboys footsteps elicit soft creaks from the wooden floor
manning moves along behind him
the record finishes playing
kroenens whirling blades slice the air ripping into mannings arm
as kroenen goes in for the kill hellboy thrusts out his stone fist as a shield
kroenen bears down but hellboy fends him off with powerful deliberate blocks
kroenen hauls out one of his long swords
hellboy yanks it away and bends it like a twig
he punches kroenen in the face crumpling the steel mask smashing its lenses
you killed my father bammm
kroenen staggers back with each blow
finally the mask falls off
give your soul to god your ass is mine
an asthmatic wheeze erupts from his scarred face
kroenen is laughing
under his feet a huge trapdoor falls open
he and manning drop through along with the phonograph
hellboy grabs a rope
it spins through a copper pulley but a large knot jerks him to a stop
hellboy snatches mannings hand but loses his backpack
he looks down
the phonograph hits the ground with a crash
panting whispers well its not that big a fall
the entire bottom bristles with six foot sparkling steel blades
kroenen cautiously leans over the pit
he cant hear a sound
as he peeks swish
a loop of the rope wraps around his neck and yanks him forward
before he goes over he frantically digs his blades into the floor anchoring himself
hellboy has used the rope hanging below him as a lasso
manning clings to his powerful back as he climbs up hand over hand
kroenen goes to cut the rope
reaching the top oh no you dont hellboy wraps the rope around his stone fist and with a brutal stone fist yank pulls kroenen into the pit
with a horrible scream kroenen drops headfirst past them and onto the spikes
he wriggles like a fish caught on a hook only making it worse as he slides further down the blades
hellboy climbs out and sits
sees kroenens blade embedded in the floor
holding it the prosthetic hand still ticking
hellboy peers down
still alive kroenen frees one arm slicing through his own ropy bicep
you like playing possum you nazi pinhead
beat then try playing dead
hellboy tips a massive cogwheel over the edge
kroenen emits a horrid scream as it crushes him
manning sits down bandaging his injuries
hellboy kneels down
are you okay
manning nods weakly
hellboy brings out a cigar and fires up his zippo
youd better stay here
ill find a way out
well come back for you
you call that thing a cigar
you never ever light a cigar that way
he digs out one of his fine cigars cuts it and hands it to use a wooden match
it preserves the flavor
he lights it for him
smiles my job
a narrow tunnel
liz and myers advance carefully
just ahead a cave in
pieces of ceiling timber coffins and corpses form a chaotic barrier
as they squeeze past
so he thinks that you and i
thats why hes mad at me a few bones roll by
wet earth drops onto their shoulders
they draw their arms close to their bodies pointing their flashlight beams straight down
a moment of strange intimacy
but its not true is it
that you feel that way about me
you want to know now
red white whatever guys are all the same
hellboy labors up a steep slope using rocks and roots for handholds
he reaches a dead end and collapses out of breath
light filters through a crack in the ground he can faintly hear liz and myers
liz and myers reach a wider section of tunnel b
they find themselves calf deep in brown water
myers lights lizs path as she steps onto a large stone
his light shorts out
she shines her light past him
oh my god
his flashlight comes back on revealing a complex natural cavern
an entire wall is covered with translucent eggs
sammael is there gnawing on a dry arm bone with the hand still attached
when the light hits his face his milky pupils constrict
a second sammael emerges from the water
it shakes itself off
a third one raise its head
myers and liz try to back away but a metal wall rises right behind them klankkkkk
they are trapped
myers goes to grab a set of explosive belts
tries to set up the timer
one sammael snatches them away
myers falls to the ground clothes torn injured
into the radio marco marco marco
get your big red butt over here
something stomps on the ceiling directly above them
again and again
hellboy pounds the floor with his rock hand
hang on kid im coming for you
the rocks below him start to crumble
in an ant farm view of the complex we see hellboy above pummeling and in the cavern below liz and myers
dust and rocks fall from above
the four identical creatures move in on liz and myers
myers shoots one in the head three times
the creature shakes off the hits as if pelted with pebbles
one of them springs
as it flies through the air hellboy crashes through the ceiling
he lands on top of it along with a ton or two of stone
the creature is crushed
two eggs glow metamorphosing
presto two new sammaels are born
the first two sammaels growl joined by the two new ones
liz sprints to safety
just couldnt leave you two alone
hellboy scoops up myers and deposits him next to liz
lit by myers flashlight two of the creatures jump
one clamps onto hellboys back the other onto his leg
the third one joins in like lions dragging down a zebra
this time though the zebra fights back
hellboy pulls out his gun and fires a round into the chest of a sammael
two eggs glow two new sammaels are born
hellboys torso is covered in blood
he falls to the ground
a fourth and a fifth creature spring onto him biting
hellboy is in trouble
liz watches and shivers
a ripple of heat shimmers over her body
at myers hit me
liz is desperate crying
hit me beat all of my life ive run away from it
now i want it to happen
water explodes under the fighting bodies
two of the sammaels turn their attention to liz and myers
i cant i liz slaps him
i know now i love him
ive always loved him
a beat of silence then myers slaps her across the face once
the heat ripple builds
the air vibrates around her
her pupils kick back light like an animals
myers ducks behind a rock as lizs arms blaze with fire
the two approaching sammaels are ready to pounce
on top of hellboy one of them turns its head like a lion hearing the hunters gunshots
a staggering hellboy sees lizs body shake in a surge of white hot energy
the water at her feet blows away as a concave shockwave of fire expands
the fire engulfs the creatures
devours them all
the screen fades to white and then
silence then a pulse
a high ringing tone
hellboy pushes away the half cooked remains of two sammaels
the other creatures are little more than blackened bones
he stumbles forward
no water left
everything is half buried in a cracked bone dry bed of mud
liz lies on the ground on her side unconscious
myers is alive but too groggy to even acknowledge it
weakly hellboy turns around in the eerie silence of his deafness he sees grigory laughing noiselessly witness to an absurd comedy
and in a simple brutal move hits him with a hammer hellboy slowly comes to
he is chained to a massive wooden yoke
he takes notice of his surroundings a large church like space surrounded by funeral niches and statues holding swords
high columns flank huge mechanical gears
an solar system model takes the place of an altar
off to one side ilsa uses a hammer to destroy the timers on the explosive belts
next to the main nave myers is tied to a stone pillar
under his feet a blood channel leading to the immense stone slab bought from lapikov
liz lies at grigorys feet
hes dressed in a ceremonial robe and holds his leather book open
his back to hellboy he faces a mural of the angel abbadon holding a key
and i looked and beheld an angel and in his hand the key to the bottomless pit
hellboy tenses rage building
the yoke creaks but doesnt bend
gestures at the stone piece these were the words i heard as a peasant boy in tobolsk
and now the door sent by the ogdruh jahad so that they might at long last enter our world
to hellboy you are the key
the right hand of doom
hellboy studies the stone sculpture its three hand imprints triumphant what did you think it was made for
open the locks
hellboy stares at his huge right arm as if for the first time
dont do it
dont do it
ilsa kicks myers in the face
the open dome above reveals the moon
an eclipse is beginning
the altars clockworks monitors its progress
imagine it an eden for you and her no
grigory turns to hellboy
reasonable in exchange for her life then open the door
in torment hellboy shakes his head no
as you wish
he leans over liz whispers in her ear her body arches her mouth emits a plume of energy
grigory greedily inhales it
then she goes limp
he struggles again
one of the cuffs snaps
he swats ilsa with his free hand
she stumbles backwards
now hellboy fights to free his other hand
indifferent grigory watches the eclipse
her soul awaits on the other side
if you want her back
beat open the door and claim her
his head and heart racing hellboy struggles for an answer
cant find one
the moon is almost totally eclipsed
he drops his gaze
his voice a hoarse whisper
grigory moves close to hellboy
rips the rosary off his wrist
it lands near myers
names hold the power and nature of things
mine for example
rasputin the crossroads
beat and crossroads i have become
beat your true name anung un rama
become the key
closing his eyes anung un rama
hellboys stone arm glows
ancient symbols of fire burn the stone
flames momentarily engulf his body
hellboy roars as his horns majestically burst forth
out of his mouth energy and light boil like condensing breath on a winters night
inebriated with power the new prince of hell smiles with supreme arrogance
his shadow falls on the white marble of the slab and mysteriously spreads over it until the stone turns black as obsidian
dont do it
listen to me
hellboy inserts his enormous paw into the first imprint on the stone slab clack
he turns it like a lock
a beam of crimson light shoot upwards into the sky
visible from all over moscow the beam blazes to the moon
the same phenomenon as in the prologue but this time its more intense with ripples and haloes
again the infinite starry space
again the ogdru jahad
the ruby beam pierces the darkness
hellboy watches as the first imprint disappears
in its place a burning glyph
myers struggles with his bindings
the rough hemp cuts his skin but he manages to free one hand
ogdru jahad shifts suddenly breaking free
gelatinous limbs uncurl expand
its enormity puzzles the eye obscuring the frame
hellboy thrusts his hand into the second imprint
he turns it
myers spots the broken rosary and reaches for it grigory drinks in the first signs of the arrival and laughs
the final seal
hellboy puts his hand inside clack
before he can turn it myers reaches the rosary
ilsa lunges at him
he clobbers her full in the face
she staggers back and down
to hellboy remember who you are
he throws the rosary at hellboy
instinctively hellboy catches it
it smokes in his hand
he tosses it away
it lands next to the explosive belts
hellboy opens his palm seeing the smoking charred imprint of the cross and beads
he looks over at grigory
with a blood curdling scream hellboy grabs his horns with both hands brutally snaps them off
energy spews from the stumps
he stabs grigory with one of them
grigory drops to his knees holding his stomach
hellboy drops the blood stained horn
the final lock disappears into the stone
the light flickers and the connection with the moon is broken
ilsa licking her bloody lips looks up
the sky is silent
the thunderclouds are parting
the eclipse has ended
grigory crumples in agony
the burning glyphs in hellboys stone hand dim down his features and body resume their usual shape
all is quiet
you will never fulfill your destiny
you will never understand the power inside you
i can live with that
he breaks myers chains helps him up
hellboy painfully takes lizs limp body in his arms
myers stands by his side
he kisses her forehead caresses her hair then walks down the steps
myers steps on something
he looks under his foot a smashed glass eye
out of the silence a whisper
grigory on his knees smiles
dying look what youve done he looks up
in his empty eye socket fleshy tendrils shift lazily
youve killed me an insignificant man
but you have brought forth a god
he uncovers his abdomen
long fleshy pseudopods spill out of the wound like intestines
a large entity erupts from grigorys torso and claws the air
behold my master behemoth
guardian of thresholds destroyer of worlds
covered in steamy slime a seven foot multi tentacled shape baby behemoth lands on the stone slab
the squirming flesh surges up like greasy pink foam
growing exponentially by the second
ilsa kneels and embraces grigorys corpse
kisses him on the mouth
a gargantuan tentacled shadow looms above them
hell will hold no surprises for us
a tower of flesh disdainfully crushes them both
in a passageway hellboy carefully hands lizs body over to myers
keep her safe
no matter what
ill deal with whatevers back there
how big can it be
as if in response a massive tentacle fills the tunnel reaching for him
oil lamps hanging from the ceiling smash onto hellboy s head as he is pulled back at breakneck speed finally confronting behemoth
the size of a house hellboy head smoking writhes in the grip of the tentacle
it suddenly throws him toward the ceiling
as he arcs back down abm
he cracks the floor wide open
next to him the rosary and the explosive belts
he tries to grab them
the tentacle slams down blocking his way
the vibration sends the belts down into the crack
they bounce off a small ledge and land further down
far below grinding cogwheels and gears
hellboy manages to pull a steel sword from the closest marble statue
hellboy stands up and swings the sword for all hes worth
he cuts clean through the tentacle
the tip hits the floor rolling into the crack
from out of behemoths stump
a mass of wriggling tentacles replaces the cut off section
they squirm around hellboys face as he slashes again and again fighting his way forward
he leans into the crack stretches his arm struggling to grab the belts
a few inches short
he jumps into the crevice onto the first ledge
the gears below grind a few falling bricks
the belts slide away
a tentacle captures hellboy pulls him up
at the last second he grabs the belts with his tail
the beast raises hellboy high
a multi layered mouth opens in the body of behemoth
the most horrible proboscis ever seen
hellboys tail passes him the belts
the timers on them are crushed
a spark spurts useless
they never work he wraps them around his stone arm
ugh now this is gonna hurt he pulls the pin on all the explosives
behemoth drops him into a squid like beak and gulps him down
after a moment a weird gurgle emanates from the creatures innards
then a surge of light roils within the thing outlining the pulpy organs
the creature starts to burn
a chain reaction yields a cacophony of explosions as behemoth is enveloped in a cloud of fire goo and soft flesh
hellboy lands with a sickening bone crunching thud
with a bellow behemoth goes down the limp tentacles missing hellboy as they vanish in a blaze of energy and light
finally just a few cinders of flesh float in the air
hellboy stands covered in goo
two final shockwaves of light ripple over the ground
ouch it did hurt
hellboy lurches into the passageway and spots myers
painfully drags himself over
lizs body is on the floor
manning limps in from an adjacent room
hellboy cradles lizs head in his huge hand
holds her against his powerful chest and whispers in her ear
a beat or two then a moan
in the dark i heard your voice what did you say
he looks at her lovingly caressing her hair
you on the other side let her go
because for her for her ill die
ill cross over
beat and youll be sorry i did
liz looks at hellboy for the first time as what he is the man she loves
a warm gentle fire rims her body
agent myers smiles a sad smile illuminated by the flames
hellboy and liz kiss
the fire haloes them and builds as tom waits cinnys waltz fills the air
