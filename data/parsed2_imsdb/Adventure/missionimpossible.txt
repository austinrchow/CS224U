mission impossible shooting draft revised by robert towne were in a large closet
jack kiefer an athletic american in his late thirties wearing a headset is wedged into a corner staring at a television screen
the television shows a surveillance view of the living room that lies outside the confines of the closet
the tv image is in black and white
jack shifts trying like hell to get comfortable but hes been there a while a bare bulb shines down on the contents of a shabby hotel room
directly under the blub a man gennady kasimov sits in a straight backed wooden chair in his blood stained t shirt
there are a couple of thugs and a stray hooker in the room behind him
a legend kasimov is sobbing
a man enters the room anatoly an imperious russian in his forties a russian godfather
the thugs and hookers are ushered out
anatoly looks down at kasimov pitiously and urges him to go and sit by him in a chair he picks up for him
kasimov does as he is bid looking gratefully up at anatoly
they speak in russian which is subtitled
kasimov kasimov good that you called us
sobbing i dont remember what happened
we were at the bar drinking laughing having fun
anatoly gets up out of the chair and goes to a bed across the room
a woman lies half under the sheets
shes lying in an unnatural position on the bed and the sheets are smeared with blood
anatoly lifts her eyelid
i dont even know how i got here
i swear anatoly i never touched her
i didnt lay a finger on her
anatoly moves away from the woman
jack impatient checks his watch
jesus shes been under too long
come on come on
youre the only one who can help me
desperately he tugs at anatolys jacket
but anatoly hits his hand away and smacks him around the head
anatoly bends close to kasimov
cmon cmon tell the truth
theyll kill me
anatoly paces up the room away from kasimov
you asked for my help
you asked for my help
youre right of course
jack leans forward
the name pal
give us the name
the contact in minsk
the contact in minsk
works in a travel agency
his name is
back on screen anatoly places a hand on kasimovs shoulder as if he had just anointed him
in the closet jack types the name into a computer and cross checks miediev comes up then posting american consulate kiev
jack turns and nods to a whorehouse waitress in costume in the closet next to him dressed in traditional russian tunic and virtually no bottom
she quickly leaves
we enter the room for the first time as the waitress does
shes carrying a tray with a bottle of vodka and two shot glasses
now we drink
he pours them out and hands one to kasimov
yes anatoly yes
something felt funny about that
dizzied kasimov swoons and passes out on the floor
anatoly moves to the closet door and opens it
anatoly reaches up to his face and tears away a mask of flesh hes no middle aged russian mobster hes ethan hunt an american in his early thirties
he gestures to kasimov contemptuously
jack hands ethan a hypodermic kit and he goes quickly back into the room
in english now get rid of this scum
immediately there is activity and people everywhere
two others come into the room and carry kasimov out
ethan goes quickly to the body of the dead woman
he cheeks the pulse in her neck shines a penlight in her eye
he strips the adrenalin kit and jabs the long needle into the dead womans thigh
he checks her pulse again checking a stopwatch
in about ten seconds the womans eyes open
claire is her name a french woman of thirty or so
she half rolls over groans and wipes some of the blood from her mouth
did we get it
we got it
on your feet
i want to sleep
can i sleep here
walk just walk
talkings good walkings better
meanwhile men in overalls take apart the room
the ceiling lifts right off the walls and the walls themselves start to come down revealing the hotel room to be an elaborate set in the middle of an empty
jack comes into the room from the closet
he hands claire her jewelry including a watch and a wedding ring
ethan stops what hes doing noticing
she looks up at him questioningly
are you all right ethan
whats wrong with you
if youre gonna do this again claire its not gonna be on my watch
jack comes into the room from the closet
he hands claire her jewelry including a watch and a wedding ring
ethan stops what hes doing noticing
she looks up at him questioningly
she almost unconsciously slips the wedding ring onto her finger
he turns and shouts to the room at large
just waiting for you tubs
he walks across the room and out the door
claire worried clutches her hands together glancing down at her wedding ring
we move in on it and come out on another wedding ring this one on a mans finger
one of several hes drumming on an arm rest in the plush first class cabin of a commercial airliner
he shoves some money into his wallet and as he does so we catch a fleeting glimpse of a photograph of claire
the pilots voice makes an announcement
ladies and gentlemen we have leveled off at our cruising altitude of thirty eight thousand feet and we should be arriving in prague right on schedule
a flight attendant makes her way between the seats passing out menus
would you like to watch a movie mr rosen
a passenger takes one
the attendant continues on
would you like to watch a movie mr phelps
the man with the wedding ring looks up
jim phelps is in his mid forties good looking intense
hes a tired man and not just now its a profound fatigue
he looks up at the attendant and smiles warmly
no i prefer the theatre
a look crosses the flight attendants face her tone becomes stilted
would you consider the cinema of the ukraine
perhaps youd choose one for me
the attendant turns and walks away
phelps sits back shakes a cigarette out of a pack and taps it nervously on the armrest
the flight attendant opens a case loaded with video cassettes of feature films
she opens a panel in the top of the case and withdraws a tape hidden back there
the attendant returns with the tape and hands it to phelps
he takes it without a word and she moves on
phelps reaches down and turns a lever on the support between his seat and the empty one beside him
he flips up a small movie screen and angles it toward himself away from the other passengers
he puts on a headset opens a door in the armrest and puts the tape in
he presses play
the image of a man comes on
eugene kittridge is fortyish but seems permanently stuck in the nixon era horn rimmed glasses short short haircut rather be caught dead than tieless
but if he catches your eye he will never ever look away
hes seated at a desk looking into the camera
on the tape good morning mr
the man youre about to see is aleksander golitsyn the screen winks and shows an image of golitsyn a burly man in his forties
the image is herky jerky videotape presumably taken from a concealed camera as golitsyn walks down a foreign street
a former kgb line x officer now working the international black market selling intelligence
this morning we learned that golitsyn has stolen one half of a cia noc list the list of our non official cover agents working in eastern europe
the screen shows an image of what such a list might look like code names and other information scrolling by on a computer screen at high speed
for security reasons the noc list is divided into two encoded halves
golitsyn already has the cryptonym portion which contains agent code names and targeting areas
this portion is useless unless combined with the second half the true name list that is kept in the cia station in our embassy in prague
the embassy itself comes on screen a beautiful old building at the base of the charles bridge which spans the vltava river
we believe golitsyn plans to steal the true name list at an embassy function tomorrow night
your mission should you decide to accept it is to obtain photographic proof of the theft apprehend those involved and return the stolen list
i dont have to stress the importance of this matter jim
were keeping it internally black
because of its urgency ive already sent to prague a team selected from your usual group
still photographs come on screen some of which were already seen jack kiefer claire and ethan
ethan hunt will of course be your point man as usual
hes in kiev were getting word to him now
phelps sits back in his seat closes his eyes and rubs his tired brow
kittridge himself comes back on the tape
as always should you or any member of your im force be caught or killed the secretary will disavow all knowledge of your actions
this tape will self destruct in five seconds
good luck jim
phelps inhales deeply the tape in the armrest starts to smolder sending up a plume of wispy smoke and phelps exhales concealing the plume in a cloud of cigarette smoke
sarah and hanna a german woman in her mid thirties enter
another legend the imf teams safe house is a sparsely furnished prague apartment with a panoramic view of the city
the imf team is scattered around the room
sketches pads overfilled ashtrays and equipment are strewn everywhere
jack and sarah seated next to each other jack demonstrating the visco glasses to her
claire is seated opposite jack at the computer
jim and ethan are in the kitchen
hannah taking a roll of black out curtain through the room
look to your right then back to me
theres a camera built right into the bridge
whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here
can you hear me
of course i can hear you
no in your
you have a lovely smile eyes
can you hear me now
loud and clear
whats going on
i dont know
why dont you take a look
thats what we do isnt it
jack youre so wicked
too wicked to have a drink later
i think i might just take that look
ethan and jim phelps are in a heated conversation
yeah well jim fact is ive got more than ninety days leave coming
a hundred and sixty seven i think it is
take it all if you want
after this one
i thought id take some now
quietly to ethan what the hells made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time
claires in a weird mood too
whats the problem
i dont know i had to go to chicago again
you were in kiev
you tell me
tell you what
when you started noticing your short term memory loss
what the problem was you and claire had in kiev
laughs ah god forget it
what are we talking burnout here
ethan you cant burn out
because i cant afford it
and because youd burn up before youd burn out
claire who is at the computer behind them somehow seems to be the reference point in the following exchange how was chicago
ran into a convention of auto dealers at the drake hotel
you hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to mars after two years
his wifes got a year old kid
so he says all right
who was it
my friend harry
she says no
oh it was my friend sammy
she says it wasnt sammy
oh i suppose it was my friend lou
no whats the matter dont you think i have any friends of my own
the back of claires head is in his line of sight
boy you really are grim
come here take a look
he leads ethan to the window which overlooks the city
ethans pov of embassy
beyond charles bridge there is our embassy
tomorrow night if anything goes wrong this guy will steal the names of our agents in every country all over eastern europe
up for grabs to the highest bidders third world terrorists arms dealers drug lords any and everybody whod love to get rid of long term coverts like us and some
very dear friends among them
if theyre exposed theyll be executed
come over here
take a lock at this
claire who is working at a computer has pulled up a quicktime video image in a box on her screen
in it an old edition of the mclaughlin report the pbs news show is playing
ethan is distracted by it
senator waltzer a bearded bespectacled man in his forties is holding forth ill go you one further
i say the cia and all its shadow organizations have become irrelevant at best and unconstitutional at worst
its time we throw a little light on the whole concept of the pentagons black budget
these covert agency subgroups have confidential funding they report to no one who are these people we were living in a democracy the last time i checked
ethan looks back at jim
youre going to use walter
hes our guy
isnt he chairing the armed services hearing
not this week
this week hes flyfishing at the oughterard slough in county kildare with one of our best irish guides
he wont be back in a hurry
no not in a hurry
what do you think
you think the plotll work
if the main character does
if you were me ethan who would you trust to make him believable
jack comes breezing in with a piece of bubble gum
sorry am i interrupting
jack shows the gum to ethan
stick of gum
if you come up against a lock you cant pick half the gum is red the other half is green
mash them together asta lasagna
dont get any on you you have five seconds
he offers the gum to ethan
are you gonna take it
claire glances up from the computer and catches ethans eye
phelps may have caught the glance but is focused on ethan
relenting give me the god damn gum
just dont chew it
the american embassy glitters beside the vltava river
party at the embassy tonight
jack wearing black coveralls and slightly odd looking eyeglasses theyre called visco glasses enters an elevator shaft through a small door at the base of the wall
he looks up the shaft shining a flashlight until he finds what hes looking for a gray metal box protruding from the wall one floor up
phelps is at a table in the safe house apartment watching the bank of monitors hannah wired together earlier
the monitors are alive now showing various views of the inside of the embassy where the party is going on and one view of the elevator shaft
phelps wearing an imf headset and speaks into the mouthpiece
windows open by twenty three hundred
inside the embassy the party is a formal tuxedoed affair thats in full swing on the second floor
senator waltzer the man who was on tv walks up a grand staircase headed in
an american diplomat in a tuxedo hurries up to him
how do you do senator im rand housman the ambassadors aide
if i could just steer you through the reception line here the diplomat pilots the senator by one arm guiding him to a reception line at the base of the
stairs to the party
allow me to introduce jaroslav reid the director of the national gallery petr brandl the mayor of prague sarah a very attractive young american dressed in an elegant gown steps
out of the reception line and shakes hands with i bet you dont remember me do you senator
of course i do
how are you miss norman
he leans in and kisses her on the cheek and as he does so sarah whispers something in his ear
hes in pocket
under the archway behind me
her tone her words we realize shes on the team
the senator pulls a pair of visco glasses from his pocket and if we didnt know the senator was ethan before this confirms it puts them on and looks up
over her shoulder
aleksander golitsyn the ukrainian has just come in from outside
phelps sees the senators point of view of golitsyn through the glasses broadcast back to phelps monitor
he speaks into his microphone
sarah mark the package and go to two
sarah still has the senators attention
your advance team mentioned youd want a tour of the facility so ive gone ahead and set that up for you terrific
lets get going
to the diplomat will you excuse us
he slips an arm around sarah and they walk off not into the party but the other way toward a staircase that leads further into the embassy
jack climbs up the elevator shaft towards the gray metal box
he just begins to remove the cover when he hears a noise from above
he looks up and sees the elevator above him descending
jack quickly pulls himself flush against the wall
the elevator comes down adjacent to him and stops pinning him to the wall
as the senator and sarah pass behind the entering golitsyn sarah pulls a small bottle of perfume from her purse
but as she sprays she points it slightly to the left missing herself and hitting the back of golitsyns head
he never notices
they move on and down the flight of stairs
jim phelps monitors the visco views of the party
he looks to the fourth monitor and checks a view of the party a jumpy one as someone hurrying up stairs
on a flight of stairs hannah dressed for the party and slightly out of breath hurries up the stairs
she also has a pair of visco glasses which she trains on the party below
she pushes a micro switch on the side of her glasses activating an electronic filter which tints the lenses
hannah pull the shade or hannah go to night vision
hannahis visco pov the party looks the same but one head in the crowd stands out
that head is golitsyns his hair a fluorescent green where sarah sprayed it
the senator lets just call him ethan and sarah come down the stairs and pass a sign that says denied area political attaches only
ethan checks his watch
he nods to sarah they round a corner and come to an elevator at the end of the corridor
a sign in front of it says out of order
they head for it anyway
a marine guard appears from behind a side door catching them by surprise
governors in position
we have the elevator
excuse me can i help you
which leads directly to the denied area the only limited access area in the whole facility
sarah flashes an id at the guard and keeps talking
as you can see
this area has both a marine guard and video surveillance and is strictly monitored at all times
she walks up to the thumbprint analyzer on the elevator bank and slides her thumb inside
the panel lights up and flashes a message access denied
sarah and ethan trade a look
covering senator dont you have a young man on your staff named she tries the thumb again still no soap
jack i believe we did have a young man named jack not a reliable man as i recall
constantly late or behind in his work
now the guard noticing that sarahs not being allowed access comes closer to them
excuse me let me see that id again
jack is still pinned to the wall by the elevator listening to their conversation
jacks pinned down sarah
should be a second
with the senators southern accent we were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times
finally the elevator moves down a floor and jack is freed
relax your crack foghorn im workin on it
he quickly opens the gray metal box revealing a maze of circuitry
he patches in his computer climbs on top of the elevator and hits the keyboard beginning to download
theres a split screen of sarahs thumbprint and the id picture
jack downloads her file into the security computer
ignoring the guard sarah turns and slides her thumb into the thumbprint analyzer once more
the panel glows this time the message flashes and the elevator doors slide open briskly
the guard surprised now catches sight of the senator
he snaps a salute
ethan and sarah get into the elevator and the doors close behind them
jack looks down at the elevator below
through a grating he can see them inside
the drink date with sarah is definitely off
phelps moves from jacks view of the elevator car to hannahs view of the party on his video monitors
a touch of impatience hannah im blind again
hannah stationed on the second floor of the embassy moves to get a better view of the party
she reacquires golitsyns glowing head
hes heading to the denied area
this work room is filled with combination lock filing cabinets and various computer terminals
ethan hands sarah his visco glasses and she crosses the room placing them upside down on top of a filing cabinet
ethan straps on a visco wrist monitor and tunes it in switching several times
to sarah higher
sarah adjusts the glasses
the view of the main computer terminal is upside down but clear
anyone sitting there will be recorded
on phelps monitor we see ethan via his visco glasses on the filing cabinet standing next to the computer
phelps barks out a warning
get moving ethan
hes rolling to you
ethan pushes the elevator button but the elevator is already moving up
jack were in position
in a split view we see both sides of the elevator wall simultaneously on one side jack is lying on top of the rising elevator on the other side ethan
and sarah are waiting for it to arrive
i didnt touch it
the elevator stops the doors open and golitsyn gets on
golitsyn descends in the elevator with jack on top and ethan and sarah waiting down below
phelps sees jacks point of view of the elevator with golitsyn inside
tension rising hes in the box ethan hes in the box
ethan and sarah are waiting in front of the elevator the one golitsyn is about to step off of
ethan looks around for a place to hide
taking golitsyns exit
jack open the doors
what about my coat
i dont have it
phelps whips over to a laptop and starts typing
opening the doors
he jabs enter on his keyboard
the elevator doors whisk open revealing the empty shaft beyond
ethan and sarah jump into the shaft
ethan and sarah jump down into the five foot empty space below the work room floor
above them the elevator continues its descent with them hiding below
the elevator drops to just over their heads and stops
golitsyn steps off the elevator crosses the room and slides a
computer disk into the computer in the work room
through the visco glasses we can clearly see him at work downloading the vital information
waiting below the elevator ethan takes off his jacket starting to reverse it
he checks his visco wrist monitor as golitsyn perpetrates the theft
he smiles and speaks into a microphone
hes got it
saved your ass again jack
give me a break pops
such a nice ass
and a lonely ass
claire transport in five minutes
back inside ethan strips off his mask and wearing his now reversed jacket he and sarah exit the small door at the base of the elevator shaft
jack rapidly disconnects his equipment
but as he pulls the final electrical clip from the elevators wiring it flashes and sparks
ethan and sarah exit an embassy service area by the waterfront and blend into the embassy crowd as an amorous couple
jack open the door let the package roll
opening doors now
stairway youire wrapped go to transport
ethanis voice comes over hannahis earpiece
hannah breaks off and goes up the stairs
the button marked roof lights up seemingly all by itself
the car engages with a sharp jolt hey
and starts to rise
jack looks down into the elevator car through the grate
thereis no one in it
on one of his monitors phelps sees the elevator moving in the shaft
jack what are you doing
iim not doing anything
i donit have it either
phelps is typing at his keyboard and jamming the enter button but gets no response
i donit have it i donit have control jackis face pales
he looks up above him at the approaching ceiling
uh then i have a problem
golitsyn pulls out the now programmed disk from the computer slips it in his jacket pocket and heads for the door
jack looks up through his visco glasses at the approaching roof covered with spikes
through the monitor ethan sees jackis p
of the roof of the building approaching
cut the power
cut the power jack
do you hear me
on top of the elevator jack has ripped open the control panel again and is frantically trying to adjust wires to get the thing to stop
he swears his fingers fumble he works faster and faster
he looks up
the roof of the building is nearly upon him
come on jack come on
jack looks up again he cringes he covers his head with his hands he screams and heis crushed to death against the roof ethan is staring at the static on
the monitor that once was jackis signal
he closes his eyes knowing what that means
phelps also sees the static
stay where you are
iim on my way
he gets up and races out of the apartment
who now has the disk jabs again and again at the elevator button but it wonit even light up
he studies the elevator doors and jumps into the shaft just as ethan and sarah did moments before
he hits the floor of the elevator shaft and exits the small door at the shaftis base
phelps hurries towards the bridge
phelps dashes onto the charles bridge and heads across the river toward the embassy
he throws a look back over his shoulder
paranoiais setting in
outside the embassy golitsyn escapes pushing through the service area door and racing past a drunken couple who are in the midst of a loveris quarrel in russian
pan past the embankment and onto the bridge where phelps is still racing to meet ethan
but he stops suddenly as if hearing something and looks behind him at the deepening gloom
ethan and sarah hear phelpis voice over the monitor
the package is in the open
heis in the open
iive got a shadow
can you lose him
over ethanis shoulder sarah sees golitsyn getting away
fog starts to roll over the river towards the bridge
heis out of pocket
to phelps jim we canit
thatis an order
negative golitsynis on the move
seated in the getaway car claire listens to jim and ethan argue
no damn it no i said abort
outside the embassy sarah and ethan argue
sarah eye on the package
jim iim coming to you
jim gave an abort we should walk away
no weire going to recover the disk understand
ethan takes off for the bridge leaving sarah to shadow hannah hurries toward the getaway vehicle
ethan moves to the bridge stairs
where are you
about two hundred yards from the bridge
theyire covering this frequency ethan
cut all radio communications
cut all radio communications
ethan continues to run toward the stairs to the bridge
past claire who sits in the getaway car
he looks on his monitor and again sees phelpsi pov
only ominous silence
phelps is looking back over his shoulder
the bridge is deserted
sarah follows golitsyn as he hurries toward the shore where a cobblestone promenade runs along the river
he disappears into the fog at the edge of the river
ethan checks his monitor again
phelpsi point of view changes radically as his head swivels on the darkened bridge
he whirls again looking over his shoulder and this time the barrel of a gun is visible pointing at him and before phelps has a chance to react a gunshot
crackles over the monitor
the point of view goes crazy for a moment then over and down to a bloody hole in his own chest
his head rocks again then goes over the side of the bridge and makes the long hard fall into the river below
ethanis face goes white with shock
he races up the rest of the stairs to the bridge but thereis no sign of phelps
ethan runs to the railing and looks down into the river but sees only dark choppy waters below now becoming obscured in the gathering fog
he turns and looks to the embankment
he can faintly see golitsyn hurrying along the promenade
ethan gives chase
ethan runs towards the getaway car reaching a vantage point on the top of the stairs he can see claireis outline visible in the driveris seat
but as he descends the stairs the car explodes and bursts into flames the force of the blast knocks ethan back
he watches the burning car in stunned silence for a moment a stunned crowd starts to gather
remembering sarah he rushes down the stairs towards the embankment
sarah comes out of the fog near the riverbank and sees golitsyn again slowing down
a man comes out of the fog an seems to ask golitsyn for a light
sarah draws closer
behind her the drunken couple seems to be hanging with her for some reason
ethan continues towards the embankment
sarah is almost to golitsyn
suddenly the man in front of pulls him towards him sensing something wrong sarah quickens her pace
the man is now hunched over golitsyn facing away from sarah going through golitsynis pockets
the figure finds what itis looking for the disk and takes it
sarah comes closer and the figure whirls
it brings a knife up sharply plunges it into her chest and slinks away out of sight
ethan races around the corner onto the embankment
he bursts out of the fog just in time to see sarah fall to her knees over golitsynis body
ethan sees the knife in her chest and he pulls the knife out of sarah who is close to death
he looks at it it is a black teflon knife with a serrated edge
the drunken couple seem drunk no more
in fact theyire watching ethan
through the fog and night they see him leaning over sarah holding the knife in his hands
sarah goes still
ethan lays her down turns the other body over and sees that it is golitsyn
he quickly begins rummaging through his pockets
ethan hear police sirens and sees
a prague police boat siren wailing arrives at the dock in front of the embassy
the drunken man and woman stop suddenly
as three police leap off the boat and race toward the explosion ethan leaps over the gate and races up the alley and out of sight
ethan unscrews the mouthpiece of a payphone receiver
heis holding a flat piece of metal with six prongs on it a modernist cockroach
he clicks the cockroach into the guts of the phoneis wiring piercing it with its little prongs
he screws the mouthpiece back on holds the phoneis tongue down for a second releases it and listens
he has a dial tone
now he punches in a fourteen digit number he knows by heart
after a moment a flat voice comes on the other side
bravo echo one one
there is a long pause and then familiar voice comes on the line
this is kittridge
a funny series of clicks comes over the line
claire jack even jim hannah maybe i donit know are you damaged
they knew we were coming
golitsynis dead too
the disk is gone
are you intact do you read me
the list is in the open lets just bring you in safely and then well worry about that okay
were you followed
ethan closes his eyes
kittridgeis voice is strong and reassuring and he needs that right now
i donit think so
donit think be sure are you clean
iill be there myself
youire in prague
heard a lot about you hunt
donit disappoint me
he hangs up
ethan does the same
he stares at the phone for a moment thinking
he checks his watch
ethan steps out of the phone booth and starts down the street
every face seems to be starring at him now every sound is menacing
he pulls his coat in tight shoves his hands in his pockets and walks among the crowd
ethan makes his way past the old town clock a towering gothic structure and into a plaza surrounded mostly by residential buildings
ethanis pov straight across from him is a glass enclosed restaurant built on the portico of an old palace
brilliantly lit up from inside the restaurant positively shimmers every table visible from everywhere in the plaza
ethan walks in the glass front doors right next to an enormous fish tank part of the restaurants exterior wall
he scans the clientele carefully maybe a dozen patrons are scattered around
eugene kittridge is seated at a table in the middle
he and ethan make eye contact
ethan walks to the table a couple of quick seemingly cursory glances around the room as he goes
kittridge has been working on a pretty good sized lobster
he rises to greet ethan and they sit
i cant tell you how sorry i am
i know how much jim in particular meant to you ethan
personally as well as professionally
he spots a stack of documents on the table
ethan picks them up
theres a canadian picture bearing ethan photo and the name phillipe doucette credit cards drivers license etc
passport visas you know the drill
well work the exfiltration thru canada debrief you at langley
throw the prague police a bone you know toss them a few suspects
i follow you
weve lost enough agents for one night
you mean ive lost enough agents for one night
kittridge seems to be at the point of saying one thing then carefully you seem hell bent on blaming yourself ethan
who else is left
i see your point
why was there another team
of imf agents
at the embassy
i dont quite follow you
lets see if you can follow me around this room
eyes moving around the room the drunk russians on the embankment at and oclock
the couple waltzing around me at the embassy at and
the waiter behind hannah at the top of the staircase bowtie oclock
the other imf team
youre worried about me
why a tight little smile youre right
maybe thisll save some time
the figures around the room have grown restless
kittridge tries to indicate that its okay
he pulls some papers out of his jacket
for a little over two years now weve been spotting serious blowback in imf operations
we have a penetration
the other day we decoded a message on the internet from a czech we know as max
the arms dealer
max it seems has two unique gifts a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents
this time hes gotten to someone on the inside hes put himself in a position to buy our noc list
an operation he referred to as job
the job he thought golitsyn was doing tonight
but the list golitsyn stole was a decoy
correct the actual list is safe at langley
golitsyn was a lightning rod one of ours
this whole operation was a molehunt
yes the moles deep inside
and like you said
ethan stares at him levelly
i want to show you something ethan
he now shoves the papers across the table
theyre xeroxed copies of a wisconsin bank account in the name of donald and margaret ethan hunt
it shows a balance of
since your fathers death your familys farm has been in sub chapter s and now suddenly theyre flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank
dads illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account dying slowly in america after all can be a very expensive proposition ethan
so why dont we go quietly out of here onto the plane
how about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and i wash your mouth out with soap you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole
ethan i can understand youre very upset
kitteridge youve never seen me very upset
ethan takes something from his jacket pocket
while kittridge talks ethan unwraps whatever is in his hand
all right enough is enough hunt
youve bribed cajoled killed and relied on intimate loyalties to get away with it
youre determined to shake hands with the devil and im going to make sure you do it in hell
we see what ethan holds in his hand its the piece of bubble gum half red half green
he squeezes the gum mushing the two sides together
ethan lashes out swatting kittridges glass of wine off the table in one quick motion
as he does he hurls the piece of gum
diners look up startled at the sound of the breaking wine glass
kittridge follows the trajectory of the glass and sees the piece of gum stuck to the tank
his eyes widen
the tiny piece of plastique explodes shattering the fish tank
a hundred gallons of water flow over the man and woman knocking them to the ground
at the same time ethan bolts for the door
ethan races out of the restaurant and takes off into the deserted square
ethan enters the darkened entry
ethan glances up at the stairwell
naked light bulbs illuminate the way up
he slips off his jacket and shirt then puts his jacket back on
ethan unscrews a bulb
he crushes the bulb in his shirt and scatters the glass fragments on the steps
he climbs to the next bulb
at the now darkened door to the apartment theres the soft sound of another bulb being popped in cloth glass fragments dropping and ethans at the door
in the darkened safe house ethan goes to a vase with flowers picks it up and unscrews the bottom retrieving a sig sauer automatic
he moves through the rooms checking them as he goes
ethan checks the shower then goes to his shaving kit pulling out a shaving cream can and a hairspray can
he unscrews the bottoms retrieving cash in various denominations from various countries and a couple of passports
as he pockets them he catches sight of himself in the mirror
hes a mess
he splashes water on his face
ethan greedily tears the cap off a bottle of mineral water and proceeds to guzzle it as if he was dying of thirst
he comes back into the living room
still drinking he notices flickering lights on the other side of the room the static from the four monitors phelps was watching
one by one he switches them off
jack had been using lies closed at his abandoned desk
ethan wakes it up
the computer emits a dial tone then static as it hits its connection
it prompts ethan along job job
the computer replies ethan tries again max
com the answer he tries a few more quickly job jobs joblist
com but nothing comes up
he tries something else scroll usenet groups
the computer scrolls names of bulletin boards at a dizzying speed by the hundreds
thats not going anywhere
ethan pauses slaking his bottomless thirst and trying to figure out what permutation of job he should add to the others on his computer screen
job three fourteen
job a realization the biblical pronunciation its job he rummages around on the desk checks the bookshelf and finds a gideon bible
he turns to job and reads the bible passage kings and counsellors
he thinks for another moment then punches back into the internet and under the command select usenet group he types the computer replies the computer presents a multi colored screen
of religious icons and artwork with an accompanying message ethan types his answer job and the screen presents a stickie for him to write his message on
he does max goods tainted
consider extremely hazardous
do not use
fate will be that of kings and counsellors who built for themselves palaces now lying in ruins
must meet to discuss a
a rhythmic crunching sound and from the darkness on the other side of the room phelps staggers toward him wet and muddy his middle a hopelessly bloody mess
he looks like hes dying on his feet
ethan freezes appalled
ethan what are you doing
ethan tries to speak but nothing will come out
i needed you ethan
needed you on the bridge and you werent there
ethan reaches out to grab phelps but cant seem to touch him
phelps suddenly vanishes into thin air ethan awakens from the dream and finds himself leaping to his feet gun cocked and pointed at its what are you doing here
claire freezes her hands half raised
carefully ethan ethan its okay
ethan whats wrong with you
her right hand has moved a fraction
she freezes again
you were in the car
i heard that jim was in trouble on the radio
he said someone was
i saw you
you were in the car
no i got out of the car and i ran to the bridge
dont give me that
i was on the bridge
what happened to jim
there was nobody on the bridge
what happened to jim
ethan grabs her wrists shouting
wake up claire
jims dead theyre dead
theyre all dead
ethan releases her wrists
mumbling theyre dead
take off your coat
take off your god damn coat
he grabs a sleeve and literally tears the coat off her half spinning her around
the coat hits the floor like a dead body
claires instinctive move is to cover her chest
claire begins to shiver
ethan circles her runs his hand cursorily across her body
it accentuates claires shivering
where were you
i walked away
he said abort
he was gone so i walked away
that was four hours ago
who sent you
did they send you here
slowly who is they
did they send you
did they send you
who is they who is they
ethan grabs her by the wrists
who sent you
who sent you
screaming no one sent me
were supposed to be back here at four oclock four oclock if we abort we dont return here until four oclock four hundred four am four oclock
then the clock begins to chime bong bong bong bong
in the wake of the bells reverb ethan releases his grip on her wrists
ethan sits in front of the computer staring blankly at it still waiting for a response
claire sitting on the end of the bed
dawn approaches its very very quiet
why havent they brought us in yet
ive been disavowed
they think i killed jim and everyone else
somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents bank account
kittridge assumes im a mole theyve been tracing and ive been in the employ of an arms dealer max for the last two years to get him our noc list
a long moment while she stares at ethans back
what are you going to do
im going to get it for him
whoever the mole is i think goes by the name of job at least part of the time
cant find him but if he knows have the noc list hell find me
ethan youre not making sense
let me go in and talk to kittridge
im going to tell him you had nothing to do
claire claire claire if youre not dead hes going to assume youre with me
the computer blinks and makes a noise ethan goes to it
blinking message waiting
ethan hurries over and clicks on the message box
the screen blinks and the message shows up job corner of nekazanka and prlkopy one p
claire looks to ethan
the message is for job
im going to answer it
ethan arrives at the bus stop outside the savoy arcade
a man in a black wind breaker sits on the bench his back to excuse me could i trouble you for a match
without turning the man offers up a box of matches
as ethan takes them two men from behind take him by either arm and escort him into a car which has just pulled up
ethan slides into the back seat between the two men
matthias the man on the left holds up a black hood
he extends it to ethan who doesnt take it
would you remove your hat please
you wish to meet max
this is the price of admission
reluctantly ethan pulls the hood over his head and the car takes off
the black hood still on his head ethan has trouble sitting upright
hes before a desk in an apartment somewhere in the city its impossible to tell where as the blinds are drawn
the place is roomy and lavishly furnished expensive oriental rugs well chosen objects of art
somewhere down the block a dog barks steadily every few seconds
in the hallway outside the apartment door someone is vacuuming
matthias and the other man are nearby
i thought i was going to see max
no one sees max
then what am i doing here
allowing max to see you and hear what youve got to say
i dont communicate very well through a shroud
if max doesnt like what you have to say youll be wearing that shroud indefinitely
im willing to take the chance
maxs figure into frame
matthias removes ethans hood
when it comes off ethan finds himself looking up at a tall woman of indeterminate age
shes handsome to the point of severity
who are you and what are you doing here
i need one hundred thousand dollars
and you thought if you simply showed up i might give it to you
you gave job a hundred and twenty five thousand
the penny drops
you are not job
yes job is not given to quoting scripture in his communications
and there was its tone aggressive but playful
job is not playful
so youre something of a paradox
whether you like a paradox
i want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars
its quite out of the question
the disk job sold you is worthless
its bait part of an internal molehunt
and how might you know that
are you another company man
ah but were asking about you
why may i ask
thats the question i want to ask job
i dont know job any more than he knows me
even so im sure you could arrange an introduction
why should i
because i can deliver the actual noc list
the one you have is not only worthless its certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location
its easy to say the disk is worthless when you say i cant look at the information and see if its worthless
not a tenable position sir
okay boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes youre gonna have virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits
tell you what
how goods the rf scanner you used in the car
okay use it
but i suggest pack up first
matthias boots up
theres a little musical noise and the screen brightens
the computer whirs and clicks and a complex list of names addresses phone numbers and other personal information scrolls by
but matthias is watching the digital read out on the rf scanner
twenty six twenty seven
so far so good
thats not so good for you my friend
on the scanner the digital read out is now in the thirties
thirty two and change
to ethan doesnt mean its a signal
could just be the hard drive heating up
she looks from the scanner to ethan as if shes trying to make up her mind about something
id say youve got about two minutes
max still doubts it
the other man goes to the windows nothing happens
he opens the french doors that lead out onto a balcony
the other man comes out on the balcony
nothing out here but a beautiful day
he walks to the railing and looks down at the street
down below the dog thats still barking is tied to a street sign
abruptly it stops
back inside fifty seven
a pollution control van and a taxi arrive amidst other street activity
kittridge and the female czech agent exit the taxi as barnes and two other undercover male imf agents leave the van
led by kittridge the five imf agents wearing kevlar lined trenchcoats creep through the lobby of the building and hit the stairs
they climb them silently
a cleaning woman is vacuuming the hall carpeting when the agents come up the stairs guns drawn
her jaw drops and she turns off the vacuum cleaner
in czech switch it on
kittridge looks at her sharply and gestures
she turns the vacuum back on
they reach the door of a certain apartment and kick through it
the agents swarm into maxs apartment guns waving in all directions
kittridge sweeps in between them and takes command of the place but theres nobody here
two agents race into the bedroom and just as quickly out again
max ethan matthias and the other man move quickly across the bridge that connects maxs apartment to the tower
kittridge kicks open the door to the balcony comes outside and looks around
nobody in sight
oh dear gunther will never let me use one of his apartments again
turns to ethan phew sorry i doubted you dear boy
youre a good sport
do accept the compliment
or is it maxine
i dont have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession like a warm blanket
abruptly my deal with job was subject to a successful boot scan
obviously it didnt pass muster
what was your deal with job
six million dollars
ill give you the same
but i want the complete list now not just eastern europe
i wont do this piecemeal its too dangerous
i want the entire list the true name of every non official cover agent throughout the world
ten million in negotiable u
treasury certificates in bearer form coupons attached
and one more thing your personal assurance that job will be at the exchange
bring it to me in london
i want it by the end of the week
how will you make sure job will be there
how will you make sure ill have the list in three days
its been a delight
now where can i drop you dear boy
im not being dropped anywhere without my money
max manages to laugh without coughing
then with an admonishing forefinger im going to have to front you personally
dont lose that money without losing your life
i wouldnt dream of it
max settles back and regards ethan
a theatrical sigh
she fancies this guy
kittridge waits on the balcony for his agents to complete their search
harry barnes a middle aged gray suited somewhat gray faced bureaucrat comes to join kittridge
the mans gone black barnes
hes under until he decides to surface
look we can use someone from the embassy and we can get the local authorities involved
close off his transportation
what can we do barnes
put a guy at the airport
how many identities do you think hunt has
how many times has he slipped past custom in how many countries
these guys are trained to be ghosts
we taught them how to do it for christs sake
so what do you suggest
lets not waste time chasing him
make him come to us
everybodyis got pressure points
find out something thats important to him personally and you squeeze
ethan enters the living room
claire walks out of the bedroom holding a gun
ethan reaches into his jacket and holds up a hefty wad of currency
max made a deal with you
i deliver the noc list max delivers job
weve got seventy five rounds for your glock but only twenty for the sig sauer one pair of visco glasses with monitor plenty of passports
you said it yourself if im not dead im with you
youre sure about this
jim was my husband
i want to know who killed him
alt i want to get the son of a bitch who did this
we need help and we dont have time
they have to be local
what kind of help
the ky crypto phone a black box with an ordinary phone receiver in the top thunks down on the table
ethan plugs the phone cable from his laptop into the back
the green display on top of the ky dials a number and makes a computer connection
on the computer the screen says ethan types a password and the screen asks him for the he types in a single word
the word disavowed dissolves slowly over the stateroom of a high speed train where the newly assembled im force has gathered around a table krieger a dangerous looking frenchman of
forty or so luther stickell a muscular soft spoken american in his mid thirties
ethan and claire
luther regards the others warily
points to krieger exfil opens the pocket and to luther cyber ops lifts the wallet
after a moment where exactly is it
the one in virginia langley
inside cia headquarters at langley
krieger turns to claire
is he serious
if were going to virginia why dont we drop by fort knox
i can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and set it down inside the vault and it will be a hell of a lot easier than breaking into
the god damn cia
what are we downloading
payment on delivery
i dont know
this i dont know
this doesnt sound like the luther stickell ive heard of
whatd they used to call you
the net ranger
the only man alive who actually hacked nato ghostcom
there was never any physical evidence that i had anything to do with that
correcting himself with that exceptional piece of work
you dont know what youre missing
this is the mt
everest of hacks
youre all kidding yourselves
even with top of the line crypto
stu s krieger can get it
to krieger right
may take a little time
may take a little time
thats not what claire tells me about you
thinking machine laptops im talking about the prototypes with the artificial intelligence risk chip ethan looks at krieger
twenty four hours
ethan looks back at luther
and i get to keep the equipment when were done
luther i guess youre all out of excuses
i cant just hack my way inside
theres no modem access to the mainframe its in a stand alone
id have to be physically at the terminal
luther relax its worse than you think
the terminals in black vault lock down
while ethan talks we see what hes referring to a cia analyst carrying a glass of iced tea and several file folders walks down a long corridor in the headquarters
he comes to an impressive guard station and rests his chin on a strange looking optometric device
they missed nothing in that room
even the vents have laser nets over them
apparently the device approves and the analyst is buzzed into a restricted area of the building
the analyst reaches a curtained area
he shoves the curtain aside and comes to a large vaulted door
he slides a card key into a slot leaves it there and slides a second card key into the slot beneath it
inside there are three countermeasure systems that can only be deactivated by authorized entry
which we wont have
a panel next to the analyst says intrusion countermeasures off
the analyst next spins a three digit combination code chunks the door open and steps into the secured terminal room
its not large but its impressive
a single terminal is bolted into the middle of the floor and the glass and tile walls of the room overlook computer storage towers
the first system is sound sensitive anything above a whisper sets it off
the second system is on the floor and pressure sensitive the analyst closes the vault door behind him and walks across the room
as he walks the floor tiles light up under his feet turning off again when he lifts the weight from them
and the third detects any increase in temperature
even the body heat of an unauthorized person in the room will trigger it
a thermometer on the wall shows the temperature is degrees
the analyst sets his glass down boots up the computer and starts entering data from the file folders
all three systems are state of the art
the analyst turns and takes a sip of his iced tea
a drop of condensation runs down the glass and hits the floor
when it makes contact the floor panel lights up
the other team members gathered around the table look at ethan skeptically
and you really think we can do this
the middle of the night and the train is dark
the team members come out of the stateroom to go to bed krieger heads in one direction ethan and claire in the other
his attention is drawn to the car ahead
there is a window in the door to the car and he looks through it
ethan sees the business car a plush space for busy executives to get some work done on the train
there are laptops cellular phones desks that fold out in front of spacious seats
a female executive forty or so is seated at one of the desks typing away into her laptop
ethan knocks on the compartment door
may i come in
wary but interested sure
train claireis compartment night ethan and claire enter ethan closing the compartment door
he pulls an envelope from his jacket and holds it out to her
she takes it waits
and a second passport
if anything goes wrong when were inside if you sense even the slightest deviation dont look over your shoulder you walk away you hear me
just walk away
you dont think were going to make it
i didnt say that
you didnt have to
i just need you to be safe
what about you
what about me jim called an abort i didnt comply
i lost the team
i just need you to be safe
claires coolness causes ethan to hesitate just enough to take it in
i wish id never laid eyes on you
and theyre suddenly violently in each others arms kissing and half falling onto the converted bed
she suddenly resists
he senses it and pulls away
he rises and goes to the door
hes got his hand on the knob when claire wraps her arms around him from behind turns him to her and kisses him deeply
this time they sink slowly to the bed
seen from the air cia headquarters is a sprawling complex two huge buildings surrounded by acres of parking lots hacked out of a thick forest
kittridge barnes and their staff are hard at work photographs and biographical data of ethan on various computer and television screens around the room
kittridge leans back in his chair staring at the ceiling
what i want to know is how hunt accessed the disavowed file even after we cut off his authorization code
he may have used phelps code
they were friends and phelps was still valid for twenty four hours
if thats the case we need to implement a system to immediately deactivate an agents code immediately
kittridge brings his chair legs down on the floor with a i cant believe what im listening to
hunt just kicked us in the ass you guys are standing here trying to figure out what kind of shoes he had on
i dont care how he did it i want to know why he did it
is he recruiting
for what purpose
from somewhere in the building an alarm sounds not too loud in here
the alarm get louder as it goes off in another part of the building
too short sighted
this guys proactive he initiates the question is what does he want now and where does he need to get it and barnes what the hell is that noise
an agent is just coming in from the hallway
fire alarm gene
oh for do we have to evacuate
sirens blaring three fire trucks race past an inconspicuous gray van parked on the shoulder of a two lane highway
three firemen stomp into the main lobby of the cia headquarters building
ethan and krieger are among them in firemens jumpsuits carrying packs of equipment
ethan takes a breath as they cross to the guards desk
he looks up above him
etched into the top of one wall are the words and ye shall they reach the guard
ethan who wears visco glasses elbows to the front of the group and takes charge
to the guard we picked up alarms in sectors three seven and twelve
the guard checks a screen in front of him
thats what ive got too
the firemen look at each other
who is this guy
but he seems to know what hes talking about so to the guard what sectors the air conditioning
uh twenty one but theres no alarm in sector twenty one
i gotta go in there and shut it down
nobody goes into any sector where the alarm didnt go off
do you want to blow the fire through the whole building
reciting policy nobody goes into any sector where the alarm did not go off one fire truck is parked slightly behind the others in the parking area of the headquarters
second truck roars past
luther watches it go
luther is in the belly of the fire truck with a ton of equipment three laptops a bundle of phone cable a mini dish antenna a cellular phone several thick
phone company manuals with names like cosmos and switched access one laptop serves as a visco monitor showing a video image in which luther watches ethans point of view of the stubborn guard whos finishing his sentence
on screen and it did not go off in twenty one
luther turns to a screen on another computer and searches through a complex facilities menu
mouths twenty one twenty one he finds what hes looking for and double clicks on it
a red box on his screen lights up and the same red box lights up on the guards screen
from in the distance a new alarm begins to wail
hold it its on
ethan turns and looks at one of the firemen behind them its claire
claire and krieger follow ethan guard to corridor
claire quickly slips out of her firemans jumpsuit revealing a business suit underneath
she clips an id tag to her breast pocket
she pulls a piece of paper from her pocket a computer printout of a mans id photo
she stares at the face studying it
claire carrying a cup of coffee and a muffin looks for a spot among the tables in the cafeteria of the headquarters building
she sees a man sitting alone reading a newspaper
its the man whose picture she looked at in the storage room
she sits next to him
he looks up and gives her an acknowledging half smile then goes back to his paper
he turns to pick up the paper and in the moment he is facing the other way claire pulls out a small vial resembling a perfume sampler
she dumps the clear liquid contents into his coffee
he turns back and hands her part of the paper
coffee man drinks up
claire stares at his shoulder strangely
she reaches out and flicks something off his shoulder blade
but she hasnt flicked something off his shoulder blade shes flicked something onto it a little piece of shiny gray metallic tape
claire leaves the table
coffee man drinks up and leaves the table
luther stares at another one of his laptops this one with a blueprint of the inside of the building
a cursor begins to flash in one of the rooms
a guard carrying an mp a handheld machine gun leads ethan and krieger to a heavy metal door marked service
air conditionings through here
they turn a corner walking directly past coffee man whos coming the other way
we stay with coffee man comes out of the cafeteria walks down the corridor
he goes to the restricted access door taps the control panel
coffee man analyst walks past a guard desk and peers into an optometric scanner and we suddenly remember where weve seen coffee man before
hes the technician who works at the secured computer terminal
ethan and krieger in the service area preparing
ethan putting the mask in a bag
the guard returns
wheres the other guy
the guard moves towards ethan who kicks back at him pushing him back to krieger who zaps the guard on the back of the neck
he twitches and slumps to the ground unconscious
krieger quickly grabs him around the neck
holding the guards head with one hand krieger pulls a stiletto from the sheath in the back of his belt with the other
he jabs it toward the base of the guards skull but ethan is on him in a flash
he grabs kriegers knife arm shoving it up against the wall
staring into kriegers face in warning
zero body count
a threat well see
ethan releases him and walks away
the guard is tied up lying on the floor of the service area room
ethan and krieger are below the open vent into the duct system
the first climb is straight up
krieger cups his hands under ethans foot and lifts him up into the duct as he starts to climb
ethan and krieger crawl quickly through the ducts moving horizontally now
they reach a juncture and turn right
luther im going in
dont disappoint me
krieger from here on in absolute silence
ethan and krieger reach a ventilator shaft in the duct
a laser net protects the ventilator red shafts of light cris crossing every which way
ethan looks down through the net
he can see the computer room below and the top of the technicians head
in the duct ethan signals to krieger making a triangle of his hands
krieger wriggles forward and hands him a multi sided pyramid shaped glass object
ethan raises the pyramid and intercepts a portion of one of the laser nets beams
the pyramid glows and we realise what it is a prism
the laser beam now captive in the prism ethan carefully moves it out of the centre of the ventilator shaft and directs it toward another prism clearing a path through
up in the ceiling above it one of the screws starts to move in the ventilator shaft unscrewing
when it appears ready to drop out a thin strip of metal snakes out from between the bars of the shaft and edges up next to the screw
the screw drops out of its hole but it doesnt drop to the floor it zips over and clings to the side of the metal strip with a gentle click
as to a magnet
the screw is pulled up through the shaft
now the whole shaft moves down into the room held by a hand
it turns sideways and is pulled up into the duct
a rubber tube snakes down through the hole coming to a stop near the thermostat which says its seventy two degrees
a gentle whoosh is audible as frosty air blows through the tube cooling the room
the technician defaults the security systems outside the terminal room
it is eerily still in the locked down computer room we saw earlier
no one is there theres not a sound but for the gentle hum of the computer as it waits to be put to use
now ethans head descends slowly into the room his hair falling in front of him
at first it seems hes just poking his head in for a look but he keeps coming and coming first his head then shoulders then waist then knees and finally
we see his ankles and understand
he is lowered to stop in front of the thermometer and temperature read out on the computer
suddenly ethan is lifted back up quickly to hang at ceiling height above the computer as the analyst enters the room
the technician crosses to the computer and sits down a stack of work to his right
the technician is working away at the computer
he pauses and wipes some sweat from his forehead
with a strange look on his face the technician looks up
its almost as if he senses ethan above him but instead oh god
he reaches for the garbage can and upchucks again
puzzled sick and feeling another wave coming on he drags himself to his feet hauls himself across the room and leaves
even sick the technician still thinks to re activate the alarm systems with a card key
they hum back to life efficiently a light flashing ethan descends again slowly but steadily until he is at the same height as the computer terminal to hang horizontally in
front of the computer
a heavy velcro strap binds his ankles together secured by a rope that leads up into the ventilator shaft and through the set of pulleys
krieger holds the rope his jaw clenched sweat breaking out on his forehead
unfortunately hes three feet away from it
he stretches his arms but cant reach
he blinks unable to believe this
he curls himself into a situp and looks up into the shaft
krieger sees the predicament
ethan gestures to him pointing to the floor
slowly krieger drops him another few feet
now ethans lower than the terminal and still three feet away from it
he closes his eyes summoning his strength and does another situp bringing himself up right in front of the terminal
in the fire truck luther who is watching on the visco monitor turns his head upside down to get a look at what ethan sees
he cups his hands around the microphone of his headset and begins to whisper
we hear only the moist airy sound of his breath not the words
type this password aw b
go to the files menu find the noc list file
open noc list
put your diskette in
double click on the noc list
ethans ear receiver whispers ever so slightly
he reaches out to the upside down keyboard cranes his head to see it and starts typing softly
the computer hums activated
ethan unbuttons his pocket withdraws a
disk and slides it gently into the floppy drive
the computer accepts it with a soft whir
ethan winces even that soft sound is deafening in these circumstances
but no alarms go off
luther cranes his head again to see the computer terminal through ethans trembling viewpoint
he whispers more commands
k now were going to download
select copy to disc
when its all green its done
ethan types in the contends presses enter and the screen displays a comforting message luthers eyes widen as he gets his first look on the visco monitor of the specific
information theyre downloading
the noc list
holy mother of god
krieger shakes with the strain of holding the rope
his eyes suddenly widen as he sees something next to him
its a rat
the rat stares back
puzzled by kriegers lack of response the rat crawls forward inquisitive
kriegers eyes water his nose twitches
hes about to sneeze
luther pulls himself together and whispers another command into the microphone
youve done it
disk is ejected from the floppy drive
ethan pockets it and signals to be raised
slowly his body starts to move up
as it does a bead of sweat rolls down his nose balling at the tip
ethan ignores it
but below him he sees the floor tiles four of them lit up under the wheels of the chair at the computer terminal
his eyes widen as he realizes something the drop of sweat falls and he catches it with his right hand
cia analyst crosses corridor from restricted access door to bathroom
a toilet flushes smashing the silence and the technician staggers out of the bathroom
he goes to the sink and throws some water on his face
hes still unaware of the piece of shiny metallic tape stuck to his shoulder blade
he walks out of the bathroom crosses corridor to door
on one of luthers laptops the blinking cursor starts to move down a corridor
luther speaks into his microphone
ethan is near the ceiling but krieger isnt pulling any more
ethan looks up at him wide eyed and gestures to pull him up
krieger shakes his head no
ethan gestures what
the cursor is halfway across the screen
get out of there get out of there ethan still dangles
holding the rope with one hand krieger holds out his other demanding something
he wants the disk
the technician makes his way back down the corridor toward the computer room
the blinking cursor is near the edge of the screen and luther is sweating
hes at the vault get moving
ethan still hanging upside down has refused
krieger demands again
the technician passes through the optometric scanner
youre not moving ethan is hoisted up
to himself noc list
ethan has the diskette in his mouth
krieger leans down and takes it
he drops the knife
were not outta here yet
the technician deactivates the alarm systems swings the door open and comes back into the room
he turns to close the door behind him and in so doing just misses seeing ethans head as it is pulled back up into the ceiling
ethan throws smoke cannisters and he and krieger crawl frantically back through the duct the way they came
claire walks quickly past the guards in the reception area and out of the building
the technician enters the room and shuts the door
he sees the knife picks it up looks at it and then puts it down
he resumes his work at the computer but when he punches up his program something prints out on his screen
its header and it goes on
the technicians eyes widen in disbelief
he spins back in his chair and reaches for the nearest telephone
in the communications room tempers are running a little high
kittridge is on his feet berating his staff
think for christs sake you guys are mired in detail open your minds its gotta be staring us in the face
what does ethan hunt want same thing he wanted in prague
same thing hes always wanted
the noc list
now its coming together in kittridges mind and a horrible thought occurs to him
and where is the list vulnerable
there is nervous silence for a moment
behind kittridge on the other side of the room the phone starts to ring an agent gets up to answer it as a creeping fear pervades the room
joking other than here
nervous laughter goes around the table
on the other side of the room the agent who answered the phone turns receiver in hand face ashen
he holds the phone out to kittridge terrified the bearer of extremely bad news
they all turn slowly and look at him
he holds the phone out to kittridge shaking slightly
its for you
it may be a human scream or it may be a sirens wail but it echoes over the forest as a lone fire truck roars away from the headquarters building
making its escape
luther krieger claire and ethan the victorious team are in the trucks cab
they exchange looks of massive relief
but no one speaks
luther in particular looks heavily troubled by what theyve just done
ethan looks at claire who is jammed into the seat next to him
she drops her head on his shoulder exhausted
krieger in the drivers seat literally and figuratively
ethan just looks straight ahead and to claire
the technician who discovered the theft of the list sits at one end of the now empty conference table in the communications room
kittridge sits in a chair beside staring gravely at him
he gets up and walks to the door where harry barnes hovers
kittridge lowers his voice its barely audible
to barnes you and i know about this and thats where it stops
it never happened
what about him
he gestures to the technician who watches them anxiously
i want him manning a radar tower in alaska by the end of the day
just mail him his clothes
barnes turns to the technician who looks up at him anxiously
this street is a row of nondescript hotels one after the other with anonymous names like hotel pomeroy hotel vincent and hotel berridge
this barely furnished flat is as nondescript as the row of buildings its in
ethan hurriedly digs through an overnight bag until he finds what hes looking for the now battered bible hes used to contact max
he flips through the pages and crosses the room to his laptop which is powered up and waiting on the tiny desk
luther alone in a chair across the room
is seriously preoccupied
krieger is sprawled on a ratty sofa hoisting a lager and watching cnn
claire is at the window staring out anxious
krieger glances over the back of the sofa at ethan
you contacting your buyer
no answer ethan
from the desk ethan glances up
then goes back to the computer
krieger continues to glare over the sofa back
oh scuse me mr
ethan ignores him working
his computer jams with static as it connects to a bbs
the screen blinks and displays the familiar bible group service through which hes contacted max
when it asks him which chapter and verse for the posting ethan flicks through the bible looking for the next code
he begins to type
max now might be an excellent time to interpret scripture face to face
meet on tgv noon tomorrow
bring our mutual friend job
krieger suddenly appears over his shoulder and knocks bible out of ethans hands to the floor
youre not going to any meeting without me
my contact is extremely shy
he goes back to the computer his finger hovering over the enter button
luther and claire watch this growing conflict closely
ethan sighs and stands up
krieger pulls out the blue disk he took from ethan in the computer room and waves it in front of him
i dont think youre in any position to give orders do you
not while im holding this
stay out of this
lachez moi tagueue dont you mean this
he reaches into his briefcase and pulls out an identical disk
he puts it back in his jacket pocket
krieger stares for a second
thats not it
thats not the list
whats the matter you dont know this trick
he holds the jacket pocket wide open for krieger to look into
the pocket is empty
mock surprise where did it go
ethan walks over to claire reaches into the pocket of the trousers shes wearing and pulls out the disk
but not too far
he palms the disk in his right hand
i know what youre thinking krieger
youre thinking back in the computer room i was up here he was down there
he was carrying two discs
while he talks he rotates his hand palm away from krieger
when he rotates it back the disk is gone again
he holds up his left hand
its there now
so hard to keep track of these things
ethan shows his hands now both are empty
fuming where is it
ethan pats his pockets pretending to be frantic
i thought you had it
do you actually think id let you have the noc list
krieger just stares at him shaken
krieger looks at her
he turns completely red
when he looks back at ethan ethan holds two disks one in each hand
try any sleight of hand with my money and iill cut your throat
he tosses his worthless disk into the trash can and storms out slamming the door behind him
ethan picks up the bible and sees drake hotel
im so sorry
krieger was my call
ive never worked with him
im sorry ethan
we did what we had to do
im going to try and get some sleep
she leaves closing the door behind her leaving ethan and luther alone
ethan waits a moment then casually walks to the trash can picks up the disk krieger threw out and brushes it off carefully
he replaces it in the trash with the blue disk from his jacket pocket
krieger did have the noc list
now i want you to hold onto it
what makes you trust me
because if you knew what you were getting into you never would have done it
im not letting this list get out in the open
exactly thats your job
tomorrow on the train you cant let this list get out into the open
whats the range of this thing
its hard to tell
im gonna have to be close
ill get you close
claire opens the door
ethan i need to talk to you
ethan follows claire into her room where she shows him the television screen
on the screen an anchor in the cnn news center
the unlikely setting
a farm in the heartland of america
the state of wisconsin where federal agents claim to have broken the brain trust behind an international drug ring
for a report we go live now to cnn correspondent joe jones in the state capitol madison
cnn reporter speaks to camera on the steps of a courthouse
authorities have identified the couple as margaret ethan hunt and donald hunt
claire behind him
an older couple mid sixties exit the doors and are led down the steps of the courthouse in shackles
the reporter and other news crews race up to the door
here they are now
camera follows the couple downstairs
police roughly pull them away from the news crews
they were apprehended this morning by the dea in a major sting operation for the illegal manufacture of the drug methcathinone known on the street as cat
similar to methamphetamines cat is seen by officials as one of the most powerful and dangerous drugs in the world
some thirty four cat labs have been seized so far but the recently widowed mrs
hunt and her brother in law are believed to be involved in a global drug distribution network
a public official exits the building
the reporter and other news crews charge up to him
fairchild agent fairchild a comment please
the image on the television changes to an interview with a public official who faces a bank of microphones
i think its sad really
farmers unless theyre a conglomerate are always operating on a paper thin margin
im afraid what we have here is a case of a naive and lonely widow with a lot of financial problems who chose to make money through illegal means
that was john fairchild the dea agent in charge of this investigation
officials tell me that international law enforcement agents are expected to arrive here later today to question the hunts
this is joe jones cnn love in madison wisconsin
ethan switches tv off and paces away from it
his anger erupts and he kicks the old filing cabinets then picks up a chair and throws it across the room so it smashes into the wall
claire tries to get hold of him but he shakes her away
dont touch me
camera swing pans between them
what are you going to do
turns to her and gestures at tv hes expecting my call
strides to door im going to the station
o s at door and im going to call him
ethan comes out from a side street by liverpool street underground station and crosses the road to the main station
claire watches him from the window
ethan hurries down escalator
camera moves in on him
he crosses to the telephone boxes
he starts to dial a number
a light flashes and a phone buzzes
kittridge in shirt and tie picks up
barnes and several other agents are monitoring newscasts and engaged in various activities related to the hunt case
picking up kittridge
i see youve been out visiting the folks
covers receiver its hunt
what do you need for a pinpoint
to ethan been watching a little t
one of the technicians frantically scratches something on a piece of foolscap and waves it at kittridge seconds
hauling mom off to jail in shackles was an especially nice touch
at the console the number flashes on the technicians screen
hes in england
barnes scratches england and seconds on foolscap and waves it
covering receiver get mi
the technician opens another line on his console and begins patching through to whitehall
ethan i want to reassure you that my first order of business after you come in is to get these ridiculous charges against your family dropped and eliminated completely from
come in now we can plea down the charges against you as well
the wall clock is thirty seconds and counting down
the technician is frantically signalling kittridge to keep talking
kittridge is momentarily stuck
fortunately can i ask you something kittridge
if youre dealing with someone whos crushed stabbed shot and detonated five members of his own imf team how devastated do you think youre going to make him by marching
ma and uncle donald down to the county courthouse
i dont know ethan
suppose you tell me
ethan has hung up
kittridge looks hopefully to the technician who says lost him
we needed three more seconds
surprisingly kittridge is not as upset as he is puzzled
he wanted us to know he was in london
clearly thats the question that kittridge is turning over in his mind and he doesnt have a simple answer to it
close digital clock
angle widens to show ethan looking at it with grim satisfaction
he opens the door of the phone booth and almost smacks right into the pale weary ghostlike figure of a man standing just inches in front of him
startled ethan looks up but what he sees shakes him to the core
the man is jim phelps ethan shouts and almost falls back into the phone booth
phelps leans against the door of the booth and smiles weakly
youre a hard man to catch up with
phelps falls towards ethan
ethan tries to speak but cant even form words
ethan and phelps opposite one another in a booth phelps looking clammy and listing to one side
but the banter seems friendly and very quick two friends and close colleagues able to follow one anothers reasoning easily finishing each others sentences the next day i managed to
drag myself to the safe house mustve just missed you
anyway i checked our aliases
and picked us up in the states but you left before i could get there and i could check just so many places
yeah smaller countries dont computerize customs records so i watched europe
once you showed up in england
it was easy
you knew i liked the rentals at liverpool street
hey i showed em to you
phelps smiles warmly has to steady himself to maintain an upright position
he opens a medicine bottle and takes the pain killers
jim who do you think youre kidding
a doctors gotta look at that
you cant sit up straight
i can sit up straight
i just cant
sit up straight very well
its not important
i saw who shot me
ethan i saw the mole
it was kittridge
a fist into the table kittridge
phelps grips the sides of the table
oh my god
kittridge is the mole
how did kittridge do it
a reprise of phelpss narrative only now ethans telling it and camera is showing the events as ethan sees they actually happened
first he took care of jack in the elevator at the embassy phelps sends the elevator to the top of the building watching it go and crush kiefer
he shot you on the bridge on the charles bridge phelps using the visco glasses aims the gun toward them fires cants the glasses and tosses them into the vltava
he must have had back up take out golitsyn and sarah at the fence
there on the embankment in the night and fog it is krieger who takes out golitsyn and sarah thru the fence
how did he do hannah
here it is claire with back to camera who presses the detonator and turns dreamily to face it the explosion brilliant behind her
he couldve taken out hannah himself
phelps presses the remote detonator and the car blows
ethan looking intently at him
when you think about it ethan it was inevitable
no more cold war
no more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself operations you answer to no one but yourself
then one morning you wake up and find out the president of the united states is running the country without your permission the son of a bitch
how dare he
you realize itis over youire an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading youive got a lousy marriage and sixty two grand a year
kittridge weill go after that no good son of a bitch big time
we donit have to jim
heill come after us
whatis going to make him do that
what he didnit get in prague
the noc list
good for you
a meeting tomorrow on the tgv enroute to paris
if i supposedly deliver the noc list to max max has agreed to deliver job to me
iill have claire and luther stickell with me on the train
marcel krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in paris
phelps looks away
seems badly shaken
i was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was standing in the rain just outside the safe house
alive and beautiful
and thinking iim dead and gone
god knows what sheis had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done i
phelps breaks off abruptly
apparently some inner struggle over this threatens to overwhelm him
then controlling it no
she canit know about me
no one can
not til this is over
thereis too much at stake ethan
youire probably right
i usually am
once we leave the safehouse get in there and crash
iill call you from paris
you got it
and get a doctor
london safe house claireis room night the door to claires room in the safe house opens throwing a shaft of light over her form
ethan creeps in and closes the door behind him
it is approximately one a
claire is huddled in the corner
ethan enters and stands looking at her
walks towards her i sent the message to max
weire on for tomorrow
he steps towards her stops is this the only way
viens pres moi
she draws him down by his hand to kiss her
he kisses her again more fully
she wraps an arm around him and he holds onto the kiss
the room appears to revolve around them
suddenly itis bright broad daylight so bright it hurts our eyes
kittridge and barnes step off a military helicopter blinking at the sunlight and hurry down the steps
two agents immediately flank kittridge at the bottom and fall into step alongside ready to brief him
one of them holds out a small package with for job written on it
kittridge looks at him
he rips it open
a note inside simply says noon
kittridge looks at his watch
itis ten to twelve
as he reads the note something else falls out of the envelope and clunks to the ground
he bends over picks it up and looks at it
cradled in his hand we canit see what it is
but to him itis very interesting
he steps up his pace headed for the car
to the agent how long to the london terminus
twenty twenty five minutes
youive got ten
move the sleek front power car looking like the nose of an sst gets its volt charge from the overhead catenary
the rear power car gets its jolt
the tgv starts to move pulling out of the station
the business car is similar to the one ethan saw on the first train they look across europe
itis crowded maybe thirty men and women in suits most of them already immersed in work on their laptops or talking on their cellular phones
one such woman is max in her seat number
matthias and the other man last seen dropping off ethan in prague sit across from her her laptop is on the table next to her in her briefcase
how long until we reach the chunnel
a man puts a cellular phone and a radio cassette machine on the bunk bed
we only see his hands as he proceeds to take the parts of a pistol out of the cassette machine and assemble a wicked looking pistol from the seemingly innocuous
electrical parts inside
max is reading the financial times
matthias is looking out of the window
a cellular phone rings inside maxis briefcase in front of matthias
matthias takes the phone out
holds phone out for max itis him
into phone this wasnit what we discussed
on phone my apologies max
couldnit be helped
thereis a piece of black cloth under your seat
tear it away and youill find the disk
max reaches down and does as instructed finding the computer disk as promised
she hands it to matthias who strips off the velcro covering and slots it into the drive next to the computer in the briefcase
he boots it up quickly and turns the briefcase containing the computer toward max for her to see
one half of the screen with the heading cryptonym and operational specs is already jammed with information
the blank second half of the screen acquires the title true name and information starts filling itself in rapidly names addresses identities
as the two sides match up a legend flashes back into phone ha dear boy
i do hope this doesnit prelude a meeting in private
it doesnit dear girl
as long as you tell me where the money is
the possibility alone is worth ten million
baggage car rack
what about job
i wouldnit worry about him
once youive got the money heill find you
luther three rows behind in another seat is at work on a laptop of his own
a mobile nokia phone is beside it red light flashing
kittridge and barnes move through the second class car
they turn around and start working their way back again
at the front claire is getting desperate
a large man passes through the door behind her
the large man continues back nearing kittridge and barnes who are forced to step into empty seats on the side in order to make room for him to pass
as they move by him their vision is momentarily blocked and claire gets up to follow she follows to the rear of the car and she passes through the door
and out of the car after kittridge and barnes talk in doorway
only four more cars
and if we donit find him weill search the whole train again
whatis hunt doing on the tgv
high speed train
no one gets on
no one gets off
good place for a pass off to max
but why tell us
heis putting on a show barnes
what kind of show
i donit know
looks at his wrist monitor it didnit say on the tickets
kittridge and barnes go off back through the next coach
claire follows into the same doorway and stops to speak into her wristwatch to ethan ethan
kittridge is on the train
kittridge is job
how far is he from luther
where are you
you are my eyes
stay with him
she moves onto the next coach going after kittridge and on her computer screen in the business car an ominous message flashes
max dials a number on her cellular phone
she is calling job
into phone heis in the baggage car
assembling gun in sleeping compartment iill be there
max hangs up and hands the phone to matthias who slots it into the briefcase next to the computer
he dials a number on the keyboard and pushes send
the computer emits a dial tone
her computer flashes a message
whatis the problem
try it again
itis not working
is something wrong with the phone
pause as he tries the phone well is something wrong with the batteries
i always check the batteries
run it through from the top
the man assembling the gun clicks the last piece the silencer into place
car next to maxis car moving day kittridge and barnes looking stop in doorway
nothing but civilians gene
this is bullshit we donit even know what max looks like
maybe we donit have to know what he looks like
if heis got that list heis going to want to check it
we should be looking for laptops
luther sees them coming
he smacks the laptop shut and positions his jamming phone on the table to point at maxis computer
he gets up taking his computer with him headed for the rear of the car
a waiter sees the phone and goes after luther with it
excuse me sir your telephone
other passengersi phones nearby go haywire
luther looks to max
her dial tone finally hits the static of a computer connection and the message on her screen changes itis working
weive got five minutes
luther shuts himself in the bathroom
the other man follows him tries the door and waits his moment
the other man bangs against the door
luther braces himself against the door
claire walking through
she pauses to listen in her earpiece
iive got the money
meet me in the baggage car
she walks on
kittridge and barnes are looking at the people in the business car behind max
claire passes them by heading for the last executive coach to get to club and baggage car
she passes the other man at the bathroom door
he follows her
get this door open
kittridge and barnes have seen claire go through maxis business car and past the other man at the bathroom door
they follow but suspect the locked bathroom door and stop there to listen
claire moves swiftly through the last car after maxis car
up into the club car and opens the door leading to the baggage car
the door slams shut
kittridge the noc list is being modemed off the train
claire enters a little breathless
spotting phelpis profile in the darkened car
ethanis right behind me
listen to me jim
is it such a good idea to kill him
we take the money
ethan takes the blame
no one else has seen you alive
no one will believe him
of course iim sorry to hear you say that claire
ethan hunt darling
here phelps pulls out his assembled pistol
you knew about jim
course he did
just exactly when he knew is something of a question
before or after i showed in london mind telling me ethan
but after you took the bible out of the drake hotel in chicago
they stamped it didnit they
those damn gideons
phelpis watch alarm goes off
two minutes til krieger shows
thisill have to be quicker than iid like
certainly quicker than youid like
ethan if you knew about jim
why the masquerade
why take the risk
well claire youive asked the question and you are the answer
i knew about jim
but he didnit know about you
in all fairness ethan claire was never convinced her charms would work with you
but i was supremely confident having tastes the goods
thou shall not covet thy neighbouris wife ethan
oh ethan is in love with you claire make no mistake about it
and like all the worldis lovers heis tortured by the same one pathetic question does she feel the same way i do
jim turns to claire
well claire do you
have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them
jim lets just get the money and get out of here
claire goes to ethan
the money ethan
ethan hands her the money
youive earned it
claire goes to jim with the money
claire starts to count
tell me something claire that night in prague was it you or jim that blew up the car and scattered hannah all over town
keep counting claire
it was me
i did it
claire hands phelps the money
all ten million
fold it tight
arenit you going to thank me jim
ten million is better than six
donit flatter yourself six was for eastern europe you made a lousy deal ten for the world
what is that
but i needed you for the transfer with max
i got a little extra change and you got a little extra too
phelpis watch alarm goes off
youire wrong about one thing
iim not the only one whois seen you alive
ethan throws jim the visco glasses
good morning mr phelps
phelps and claire are stunned
you son of a bitch
phelps points the gun at ethan
now we donit have to eliminate him
you like that donit you claire
jim itis over
ethan iive always taught you nothing can be more dangerous than the truth
it can kill you
phelps shoots claire
struggle between phelps and ethan
the gun is lost
phelps beats ethan to the ground
his watch alarm beeps rapidly
he turns goes up the stairs and
ethan goes to claire
this stuff is so sticky
itis all right ethan
youill bring me back
i always have claire
ethan looks to ladder hatch and climbs ladder
phelps climbs up a ladder past an inert engineer slumped over the control panel an obvious earlier victim of phelps
phelps puts on a pair of clear goggles reaches a trap door and climbs through it halfway out onto the roof of the train
he reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a suction cup with a handle on the end of it
he smacks the suction cup down on the roof and pulls himself the rest of the way out
he pulls out a second suction cup and smacks it down on the smooth surface of the train
now for the tough part
using the suction cups phelps slowly pulls himself forward a foot at a time pulling and replanting the cups as he goes
he drags himself over the length of the final car to the back of the train where the rear engine slants off sharply a window for the engineer
half kneeling on the roof phelps pulls out the clip from his belt
he looks up scanning the sky behind the train
from out of the fog a helicopter approaches
phelps turns and looks ahead in the direction the train is going
in the distance he can see the chunnel approaching the tunnel under the english channel
his eyes widen
krieger is at the controls
he sees the approaching tunnel as well
phelps crawls like hell to get into position
looking up he sees krieger pointing frantically behind him
ethan is climbing out the trap door
a cable and hook swing down from the helicopter almost touching the roof of the train
phelps crawls closer to it
ethan behind him is in a far more precarious position
without goggles or suction cups he has to use his fingers to grab small holes on the roof
he is flipped over by the wind ending up facing the other way
loses his grip and is blown backwards over the roof
krieger sees the chunnel entrance approaching
he gestures to phelps and tries to move the cable closer to him passing over phelps and then back to him
phelps grabs the cable and is about to hook the cable onto his belt ethan slides into him and they both crash onto the roof
ethan grabs the cable out of phelps hand and clips it onto the roof
phelps and ethan struggle but they are hurtling dangerously closer to the chunnel entrance
theyre now right on top of the chunnel entrance
krieger sees the tunnel only seconds away now
he paws at the controls jerking back desperately on a certain lever
phelps kicks ethan and he falls off the far side of the train
phelps falls off the near side and holding onto the strap manages to pull himself back on
the train zooms into the tunnel as the train roars into the tunnel the business car goes nearly dark and the message on maxs computer screen changes one last time
this time it says maxs face falls
another conductor races into the power car past his inert companion and is shocked to see the copter right behind the train
he grabs a radio and screams into it
no no its the tunnel
stop the train
itll crash into us
for a moment we see no one
moving around to the other end of the car we see where theyve gone
theyre dangling from either side of it phelps paws for one of the suction cups and pulls himself back onto the roof of the train
ethan reaches for the other cup
the helicopter fortunate that this tunnel is double track and barely wide enough to accomodate it pursues krieger pushing it up to full speed again
but it cant lift up high enough to go completely over the train
phelps nearing the back manoeuvers himself to the windshield of the rear power car trying to grab the skid of kriegers copter
he doesnt see whats headed toward him coming from the other direction
at the last moment phelps notices the reflection of the oncoming train in the windshield and swings back onto the roof of his train barely avoiding getting creamed by it
as it blows by
the helicopter avoids the oncoming train too and phelps misses the skid
krieger tips the front of the copter trying to decapitate ethan with the rotor
phelps jumps onto the skid but the copter pitches so far forward the blade hits the top of the tunnel
sparks and chunks of cement fly
krieger levels the chopper quickly
ethan uses the moment to leap from the train onto the other helicopter skid
phelps and ethan now hang on the skids facing one another
crouching on the skid ethan digs in his pocket and pulls out a red and green piece of bubble gum phelps sees it and screams at krieger who scrambles frantically
for his gun
red light green light
asta lasagna mother fucker
ethan mashes the red into the green slaps the gum onto the copters underbelly and turns away from it
phelps kicks vainly at the gum screaming but the gum explodes
the force of the blast rockets ethan forward he lands on the trains windshield
the helicopter whirls and bashes into the tunnel veers wildly then pitches forward and down smashing phelps under the skid and exploding in a giant fireball
ethan stuck on the windshield can only watch as the wreckage of the copter tumbles down the train towards him
it stops just short of him with its bent and broken rotor blade barely missing his throat
ethan lays his head against the windshield glass utterly drained
kittridge comes back into the business car and is joined by barnes
luther only slightly bruised stands up next to them and gestures to max and her laptop
i think this is what youre looking for
max looks up stunned
kittridge leans over and peers at her screen
he just smiles and sits down next to her content to wait for her to speak
when she finally does shes almost charming
my lawyers will have a field day with this
entrapment jurisdictional conflicts kittridge leans closer to her and lowers his voice just as friendly
maybe well just keep the courts out of this one
im sure we can find something i have that you need
you know i would love to try
luther sits on a high stool his powerbook next to him while he sips a beer
a television screen is featuring follow up coverage of yesterdays dramatic helicopter train wreck in the chunnel
aside from emphasizing that it was the work of a lone crazed character in a helicopter who was killed in the crash there are comments about how miraculous it was
there were no other fatalaties
there are intermittent sounds of aircraft taking off and landing announcements of arrivals and departures
ethan into shot
he sits beside reach your folks
ethan nods how they feeling
the official apology from the justice department the vip treatment you know the whole nine yards
well my mother was a little confused about how the dea could mistake her and uncle donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the florida keys
luther picks up his beer
laughs and with a british accent cheers
heres to you luther
clink glasses to being off the disavowed list
hey im the flavour of the month
youre more than that luther
they were mistaken about you and theyre trying to show you they know it
they want you back in
they want me back in so i wont break in
they still cant figure out how we did it
you didnt tell em at the debriefing
i figured id let em reinstate my back pay give me a promotion check out my office at langley and then maybe talk about it
laughing its all one big negotiation isnt it
why dont you come back with me
just dont know why id be doing it
you really liked phelps didnt you
he was a good guy for a long long time
just not long enough
looks up gotta catch my flight
hows it feel being a solid citizen again
i dont know
im gonna miss being disreputable
well luther if it makes you feel any better ill always think of you that way
the two men understand one another and luther will say no more
the two exchange slight gestures of farewell and in a moment ethan disappears from the bar leaving a contemplative luther looking after him
ethan hunt slumps down in his scat dosing
a flight attendant makes her way down the aisle holding a case filled with movie cassettes
she stops before a lady passenger
would you like to watch a movie miss clarke
she then stops before ethan
excuse me mr
would you like to watch a movie
no thank you
would you consider the cinema of the caribbean
ethan just stares at her
this couldnt be what its sounding like
the camera moves into ethans face
they found him
they want him back
he looks up at her and
