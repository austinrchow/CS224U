the remorseless drought had lasted now for ten million years and would not end for another million
the reign of the ter rible lizards had long since passed but here on the continent which would one day be known as africa the battle for survival had reached
a new climax of ferocity and the victor was not yet in sight
in this dry and barren land only the small or the swift or the fierce could flourish or even hope to exist
a the man apes of the field had none of these attributes and they were on the long pathetic road to racial extinction
about twenty of them occupied a group of caves overlooking a small parched valley divided by a sluggish brown stream
the tribe had always been hungry and now it was starving
as the first dim glow of dawn creeps into the cave moonwatcher discovers that his father has died during the night
he did not know the old one was his father for such a relationship was beyond his understanding
but as he stands looking down at the emac iated body he feels something something akin to sadness
then he carries his dead father out of the cave and leaves him for the hyenas
among his kind moonwatcher is almost a giant
he is nearly five feet high and though badly undernourished weighs over a hundred pounds
his hairy muscular body is quite man like and his head is already nearer man than ape
the forehead is low and there are great ridges over the eye sockets yet he unmistakably holds in his genes the promise of humanity
as he looks out now upon the hostile world there is already a something in his gaze beyond the grasp of any ape
in those dark deep set eyes is a dawning awareness the first intima tions of an intelligence which would not fulfill itself for another two million years
a as the dawn sky brightens moonwatcher and his tribe reach the shallow stream
the others are already there
they were there on the other side every day that did not make it any less annoying
there are eighteen of them and it is impossible to distinguish them from the members of moonwatchers own tribe
as they see him coming the others begin to angrily dance and shriek on their side of the stream and his own people reply in kind
the confrontation lasts a few minutes then the display dies out as quickly as it has begun and everyone drinks his fill of the muddy water
honor has been satisfied each group has staked its claim to its own territory
a moonwatcher and his companions search for berries fruit and leaves and fight off pangs of hunger while all around them competing with them for the samr fodder is a
potential source of more food than they could ever hope to eat
yet all the thousands of tons of meat roaming over the parched savanna and through the brush is not only beyond their reach the idea of eating it is beyond
they are slowly starving to death in the midst of plenty
a the tribe slowly wanders across the bare flat country side foraging for roots and occasional berries
eight of them are irregularly strung out on the open plain about fifty feet apart
the ground is flat for miles around
suddenly moonwatcher becomes aware of a lion stalking them about yards away
defenceless and with nowhere to hide they scatter in all directions but the lion brings one to the ground
a it had not been a good day though as moonwatcher had no real remembrance of the past he could not compare one day with another
but on the way back to the caves he finds a hive of bees in the stump of a dead tree and so enjoys the finest delicacy his people could
of course he also collects a good many stings but he scacely notices them
he is now as near to contentment as he is ever likely to be for thought he is still hungry he is not actually weak with hunger
that was the most that any hominid could hope for
a over the valley a full moon rises and a cold wind blows down from the distant mountains
it would be very cold tonight but cold like hunger was not a matter for any real concern it was merely part of the background of life
this little sun that only shone at night and gave no warmth was dangerous there would be enemies abroad
moonwatcher crawls out of the cave clambers on to a large boulder besides the entrance and squats there where he can survey the valley
if any hunting beast approached he would have time to get back to the relative safety of the cave
of all the creatures who had ever lived on earth moonwatchers race was the first to raise their eyes with interest to the moon and though he could not remember
it when he was young moonwatcher would reach out and try to touch its ghostly face
now he new he would have to find a tree that was high enough
he stirs when shrieks and screams echo up the slope from one of the lower caves and he does not need to hear the a occasional growl of the lion
to know what is happening
down there in the darkness old one eye and his family are dying and the thought that he might help in some way never crosses moonwatchers mind
the harsh logic of survival rules out such fancies
every cave is silent lest it attract disaster
and in the caves in tortured spells of fitful dozing and fearful waiting were gathered the nightmares of generations yet to come
a the others are growing desperate the forage on their side of the valley is almost exhausted
perhaps they realise that moonwatchers tribe has lost three of its numbers during the night for they choose this mourning to break the truce
when they meet at the river in the still misty dawn there is a deeper and more menacing note in their challenge
the noisy but usually harmless confrontation lasts only a few seconds before the invasion begins
in an uncertainly moving horde the others cross the river shieking threats and hunched for the attack
they are led by a big toothed hominid of moonwatchers own size and age
startled and frightened the tribe retreats before the first advance throwing nothing more substantial than imprecations at the invaders
moonwatcher moves with them his mind a mist of rage and confusion
to be driven from their own territory is a great badness but to lose the river is death
he does not know what to do it is a situation beyond his experience
then he becomes dimly aware that the others are slowing a down and advancing with obvious reluctance
the further they move from their own side the more uncertain and unhappy they become
only big tooth still retains any of his original drive and he is rapidly being seperated from his followers
as he sees this moonwatchers own morale immediately revives
he slows down his retreat and begins to make reassuring noises to his companions
novel sensations fill his dim mind the first faint precursors of bravery and leadership
before he realizes it he is face to face with big tooth and the two tribes come to a halt many paces away
the disorganized and unscientific conflict could have ended quickly if either had used his fist as a club but this innovation still lay hundreds of thousands of years in the
instead the slowly weakening fighters claw and scratch and try to bite each other
rolling over and over they come to a patch of stony ground and when they reach it moonwatcher is on top
by chance a he chooses this moment to grab the hair on big tooths scalp and bang his head on the ground
the resulting crack is so satisfactory and produces such an immediate weakening in big tooths resistance that he quickly repeats it
even when big tooth ceases to move for some time moon watcher keeps up the exhilirating game
with shrieks of panic the others retreat back across the stream
the defenders cautiously pursue them as far as the waters edge
a dozing fitfully and weakened by his stuggle moonwatcher is startled by a sound
he sits up in the fetid darkness of the cave straining his senses out into the night and fear creeps slowly into his soul
never in his life already twice as long as most members of his species could expect has he heard a sound like this
the great cats approached in silence and the only thing that betrayed them was a rare slide of earth or the occasional cracking of a twig
yet this is a continuing crunching noise that grows steadily louder
it seemed that some enormous beast was moving through the night making no attempt at concealment and ignoring all obstacles
and then there came a sound which moonwatcher could not possibly have identified for it had never been heard before in the history of this planet
a moonwatcher comes face to face with the new rock when he leads the tribe down to the river in the first light of morning
he had almost forgotten the terror of the night because nothing had happened after that initial noise so he does not even associate this strange thing with danger or with
there is nothing in the least alarming about it
it is a cube about fifteen feet on a side and it is made of some completely transparent material indeed it is not easy to see except when the light
of the sun glints on its edges
there are no natural objects to which moonwatcher can compare this apparition
though he is wisely cautious of most new things he does not hesitate to walk up to it
as nothing happens he puts out his hand and feels a warm hard surface
after several minutes of intense thought he arrives at a brilliant explanation
it is a rock of course and it must have grown during the night
there are many plants that do this white pulpy things shaped like pebbles that seem to shoot up in the hours of darkness
it is true that they are small and round whereas this is large and square a but greater and later philosophers than moonwatcher would be prepared to overlook equally striking
exceptions to their laws
this really superb piece of abstract thinking leads moonwatcher to a deduction which he immediately puts to the test
the white round pebble plants are very tasty though there were a few that made one violently sick perhaps this square one
a few licks and attempted nibbles quickly disillusion him
there is no nourishment here so like a sensible hominid he continues on his way to the river and forgets all about the cube
a they are still a hundred yards from the new rock when the sound begins
it is quite soft and it stops them in their tracks so that they stand paralyzed on the trail with their jaws hanging
a simple maddeningly repetitious rhythm pulses out of the crystal cube and hypnotises all who come within its spell
for the first time and the last for two million year the sound of drumming is heard in africa
the throbbing grows louder more insistent
presently the hominids begin to move forward like sleep walkers towards the source of that magnetic sound
sometimes they take little dancing steps as their blood responds to the rhythms that their descendants will not create for ages yet
totally entranced they gather around the cube forgetting the hardships of the day the perils of the approaching dusk and the hunger in their bellies
now spinning wheels of light begin to merge and the spokes fuse into luminous bars that slowly recede into the distance a rotating on their axes as they do and
the hominids watch wide eyed mesmerized captives of the crystal cube
then by some magic though it was no more magical than all that had gone on before a perfectly normal scene appears
it is as if a cubical block had been carved out of the day and shifted into the night
inside that block is a group of four hominids who might have been members of moonwatchers own tribe eating chunks of meat
the carcass of a wart hog lies near them
this little family of male and female and two children is gorged and replete with sleek and glossy pelts and this was a condition of life that moonwatcher had never
from time to time they stir lazily as they loll at ease near the entrance of their cave apparently at peace with the world
the spectacle of domestic bliss merges into a totally different scene
the family is no longer reposing peacefully outside its cave it is foraging searching for food like any normal hominids
a a small wart hog ambles past the group of browsing humanoids without giving them more than a glance for they had never been the slightest danger to its species
but that happy state of affairs is about to end
the big male suddenly bends down picks up a heavy stone lying at his feet and hurls it upon the unfortunate pig
the stone descends upon its skull making exactly the same noise that moonwatcher had produced in his now almost forgotten encounter with big tooth
and the result too is much the same the warthog gives one amazed indignant squeal and collapses in a motionless heap
then the whole sequence begins again but this time it unfolds itself with incredible slowness
every detail of the movement can be followed the stone arches leisurely through the air the pig crumples up and sinks to the ground
there the scene freezes for long moments the slayer standing motionless above the slain the first of all weapons in his hand
the scene suddenly fades out
the cube is no more than a glimmering outline in the darkness the hominids stir as if a awakening from a dream realise where they are and scuttle back to
they have no concious memory of what they had seen but that night as he sits brooding at the entrance of his lair his ears attuned to the noises of
the world around him moonwatcher feels the first faint twinges of a new and potent emotion the urge to kill
he had taken his first step towards humanity
a ext cave and plains utopia babies were born and sometimes lived feeble toothless thirty year olds died the lion took its toll in the night the others threatened daily
across the river and the trib prospered
in the course of a single year moonwatcher and his companions had changed almost beyond recognition
they had become as plump as the family in the cave who no longer haunted their dreams
they had learned their lessons well now they could handle all the stone tools and weapons that the cube had revealed to them
they were no longer half numbed with starvation and they had time both for leisure and for the first rudiments of thought
their new way of life was casually accepted and they did not associate it in any way with the crystal cube still standing outside their cave
but no utopia is perfect and this one had two blemishes
the first was the marauding lion whose passion for hominids seemed to have grown even stronger now that they were better nourished
the second was the tribe across the river for a somehow the others had survived and had stubbornly refused to die of starvation
a with the partly devoured carcass of a warthog laid out on the ground at the point he hope the boulder would impact moon watcher and three of his bravest
companions wait for two consecutive nights
on the third the lion comes betraying his presences by a small pebble slide
when they can here the lion below softly tearing at the meat they strain themselves against the massive boulder
the sound of the lion stops he is listening
again they silently heave against the enormous stone exerting the final limits of their strength
the rock begin to tip to a new balance point
the lion twitches alert to this sound but having no fear of these creatures he makes the first of two mistakes which will cost him his life he goes back
to his meal
the rock moves slowly over the ledge picking up speed with amazing suddeness
it strikes a projection in the cliff about fifteen feet above the ground which deflects its path outward
just at this instant the lion reacts instinctively and leaps away from the face of the cliff directly into the path of the a onrushing boulder
he has combined the errors of over confidence and bad luck
the next morning they find the lion in front of the cave
they also find one of their tribe who had incautiously peeped out to see what was happening and was apparently killed by a small rock torn loose by the boulder
but this was a small price to pay for such a great victory
and then one night the crystal cube was gone and not even moonwatcher ever thought of it again
he was still wholly unaware of all that it had done
a from their side of the stream in the never violated safety of their own territory the others see moonwatcher and fourteen males of his tribe appear from behind a
small hillock over looking the stream silhouetted against the dawn sky
the others begin to scream their daily challenge
but today something is different though the others do not immediatly recognize this fact
instead of joining the verbal onslaught as they had always done moonwatcher and his small band decended from the rise and begin to move forward to the stream with a
quiet purposefulness never befor seen
as the others watch the figures silently approaching in the morning mist they become aware of the terrible strangness of this encounter and their rage gradually subsides down to an
at the waters edge moonwatcher and his band stop
they carry their bone clubs and bone knives
a led by one ear the others half heartly resume the battle chant
but they are suddenly confrunted with a vision that cuts the sound from their throats and strikes terror into their hearts
moonwatcher who had been partly concealed by two males who walked before him thrusts his arm high into the air
in his hand he holds a stoud tree branch
mounted atop the branch is the bloody head of the lion its mouth jammed open with a stick displaying its frightful fangs
the others gape in fearful disbelief at this display of power
moonwatchers stands motionless thrusting the lions head high
then with majestic deliberation still carrying his mangled standard above his head he begins to cross the stream followed by his band
the others fade back from the stream seeming to lack even the ability to flee
moonwatcher steps ashore and walks to one ear who stands a unsurely in front of his band
though he is a veteran of numerous combats at the waters edge one ear has never been attacked by an enemy who had not first displayed his fighting rage and
he had never before been attacked with a weapon
one ear merely looks up at the raised club until the heavey thigh bone of an antelope brings the darkness down around him
the others stare in wonder at moonwatchers power
moonwatcher surveys the scene
now he was master of the world and he was not sure what to do next
but he would think of something
a a a by the year overpopulation has b a replaced the problem of starvation thousand megaton but this was ominously offset by the nuclear bomb in orbit absolute and
utter perfection of the above the earth weapon
b b narrator american thousand hundreds of giant bombs had been megaton bomb in orbit placed in perpetual orbit above the above the earth
they were capable of incinerating the entire earths surface from an altitude of miles

b interrupting thank you
despite and excellent and continually improving safety record there are certain risks inherent in space travel and an extremely high cost of pay load
because of this it is necessary for the space carrier to advise you that it cannot be responsible for the return of your body to earth should you become deceased
on the moon or en route to the moon
however it wishes to advise you that insurance covering this contingency is available in the main lounge
you are cleared through voice print identification
ive reserved a table for you in the earth light room
your connecting flight will be leaving in about one hour

hows your lovely wife
b shes wonderful
and your charming little daughter
oh shes growing up very fast
as a matter of fact shes six tomorrow
oh thats such a delightful age
how is gregor
but im afraid we dont get a chance to see each other very much these days
well where are all of you off to
b actually were on our way back from the moon
weve just spent three months calibrating the new antenna at tchalinko
and what about you
well as it happens im on my way up to the moon are you by any chance going up to your base at clavius
yes as a matter of fact i am
is there any particular reason why you ask
b pleasantly well dr
floyd i hope that you dont think im too inquisitive but perhaps you can clear up the mystery about whats been going on up there
im sorry but im not sure i know what you mean
well its just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at clavius
well for one thing whenever you phone the base all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order
b well i suppose theyve been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment
yes well at first we thought that was the explanation but its been going on for the past ten days
you mean you havent been able to get anyone at the base for ten days
another thing heywood two days ago one of our rocket buses was denied permission for an emergency landing at clavius
b how did they manage to do that without any communication
clavius control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal
well that does sound very odd
yes and im afaid theres going to be a bit of a row about it
denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the i
well i hope the crew got back safely
fortunately they did
well im glad about that
b a dr
floyd at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss may i ask you a straightforward question
quite frankly we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at clavius
something apperently of an unknown origin
is this in fact what has happened
b b im sorry dr
smyslov but im really not at liberty to discuss this
this epidemic could easily spread to our base dr
we should be given all the facts
im not permitted to discuss this
are you sure you wont change your mind about a drink
no thank you
and im afraid now i really must be going
well i hope that you and your wife can come to the i
conference in june
b c were trying to get there
i hope we can
well gregor and i will look forward to seeing you
its been a great pleasure to meet all of you
b d the aries ib has become the standard space station to lunar surface vehicle
it was powered by low thrust plasma jets which would continue the mild acceler ation for fifteen minutes
then the ship would break the bonds of gravity and be a free and indepen dent planet circling the sun in an orbit of its own
b b a oh thank you very much
i see hes still asleep
he hasnt moved since we left
b a b b b b oh thank you very much
sighs well hows it going back there
hes been asleep since we left
well no one can say that hes not enjoying the wonders of space
well whatevers going on up there hes going to arrive fresh and ready to go
b i wonder what really is going on up there
well ive heard more and more people talk of an epidemic
i suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later
berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning mars flight
yes well whatever it is theyre certainly not fooling around
this is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week
i was working out what this trip must cost taking him up there by himself and coming back empty
ill bet its a fortune
b well at ten thousand dollars a ticket it comes to the better part of six hundred thousand dollars
well as soon as he wakes up im going to go back and talk to him
i must say id like to find out whats going on
b a b well good afternoon dr
did you have a good rest
its the first real sleep ive had for the past two days
theres nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest
when do we arrive at clavius
were scheduled to dock in about seven hours
is there anything we can do for you
oh no thank you
the two girls have taken wonderful care of me
im just fine
b well if there is anything that you wnat just give a holler
floyd i wonder if i can have a word with you about the security arrangements
what do you mean
the crew is confined to the ship when we land at clavius
we have to stay inside for the time it take to refit about twenty four hours
and then were going to back empty
i take it this is something to do with the trouble theyre having up at clavius
b im afraid thats out of my depart ment captain
well ill tell you why i ask
you see ive got a girl who works in the auditing department of the territorial administrator and i havent been able to get her on the phone for the past
week or so and with all these stories one hears im a little concerned about her
well im sorry about that
i wouldnt think theres any cause for alarm
yes well i wouldnt have been too concerned about it except ive heard these stories about the epidemic and as a matter of fact ive heard that ten people have
b i wish i could be more helpful captain but as ive said i dont think theres any cause for alarm
thanks very much anyway and i hope you dont mind me asking
no of course captain i can understand your concern
well thank you very much and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable
b a b b b b the laws of earthly aesthetics did not apply here this world had been shaped and molded by other than terrestrial forces operating over aeons
of time unknown to the young verdant earth with its fleeting ice ages its swiftly rising and falling seas its mountain ranges dissolving like mists before the dawn
here was age inconceivable but not death for the moon had never lived until now
b b the base at clavius was the first american lunar settlement that could in an emergency be entirely self supporting
water and all the necessities of life for its eleven hundred men women and children were produced from the lunar rocks after they had been crushed heated and chemically processed
b b b b one of the attractions of life on the moon was undoubtedly the low gravity which produced a sense of general well being
b the personnel of the base and their children were the forerunners of new nations new cultures that would ultimately spread out across the solar system
they no longer thought of earth as home
the time was fast approaching when earth like all mothers must say farewell to her children
b voice echoing i must congratulate you halvorsen
youve done wonder ful things with the decor since the last time i was here
voice echoing well
thank you dr
we try to make the environment as earthlike as possible
b ladies and gentlemen i should like to introduce dr
heywood floyd a distinguished member of the national council of astronautics
he has just completed a special flight here from earth to be with us and before the briefing he would like to say a few words
first of all i bring a personal message from dr
howell who has asked me to convey his deepest appreciation to all of you for the personal sacrifices you have made and of course his congratulations on your discovery which
may well prove to be among the most significant in the history of science
b floyd contd mr
halvorsen has made known to me some of the conflicting views held by many of you regarding the need for complete security in this matter and more specifically your strong
opposition to the cover story created to give the impression there is an epidemic at the base
i understand that beyond it being a matter of principle many of you are troubled by the concern and anxiety this story of an epidemic might cause your relatives and
friends on earth
i can understand and sympathize with your negative views
i have been personally embarrassed by this cover story
but i fully accept the need for absolute secrecy and i hope you will
it should not be difficult for all of you to realise the potential for cutural shock and social disorientation contained in the present situation if the facts were prematurely and
suddenly made public without adequate preparation and conditioning
b this is the view of the council and the purpose of my visit here is to gather addition facts and opinions on the situation and to prepare a report
to the council recommending when and how the news should eventually be announced
are there any questions
floyd how long do you think this can be kept under wraps
pleasantly im afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the council
and of course you know that the council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every one who had any knowledge of this event
there must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con sideration can be given to making a public announcement
b we will of course cooperate in any way possible dr
b a b b b b b well there it is
can we go down there closer to it
b does your geology on it still check out
yes it does
the sub surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago
how can you tell it was deliberately buried
by the deformation between the mother rock and the fill
any clue as to what it is
its completely inert
no sound or energy sources have been detected
the surface is made of something incredibly hard and weve been barely able to scratch it
a laser drill b might do something but we dont want to be too rough until we know a little more
but you dont have any idea as to what it is
tomb shine survey marker spare part take your choice
the only thing about it that we are sure of is that it is the first direct evidence of intelligent life beyond the earth
four million years ago something presumably from the stars must have swept through the solar system and left this behind
b was it abandoned forgotten left for a purpose
i suppose well never know
the moon would have made an excellent base camp for preliminary earth surveys
any ideas about the colour
well not really
at first glance black would suggest something sun powered but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun powered device
has it been exposed to any sun before now
i dont think it has but id like to check that
simpson whats the log on that
b the first surface was exposed at on the th april
let me see
that would have been forty five minutes after lunar sun set
i see here that special lighting equipment had to be brought up before any futher work could be done
b thank you
and so this is the first sun that its had in four million years
excuse me gentlemen if youd all line up on this side of the walkway wed like to take a few photographes
floyd would you thand in the middle
michaels on that side mr
halvorsen on the other
thank you very much gentlemen ill have the base photo section send you copies
b a hundred million miles beyond mars in the cold lonliness where no man had yet travelled deep space monitor drifts slowly among the tangled orbits of the asteroids
radiation detectors noted and analyzed incoming cosmic rays from the galaxy and points beyond neutron and x ray telescopes kept watch on strange stars that no human eye would eever
see magnetometers observed the gusts and hurricanes of the solar winds as the sun breathed million mile an hour blasts of plasma into the faces of its circling children
all these things and many others were patiently noted by deep space monitor and recorded in its crystalline memory
b but now it had noted something strange the faint yet unmistakable distrubance rippling across the solar system and quite unlike any natural phenomena it had ever observed in the
it was also observed by orbiter m circling mars twice a day and high inclination probe climbing slowly above the planet of the ecliptic and even artificial comet heading out
into the cold wastes beyond pluto along an orbit whose far point it would not reach for a thousand years
all noticed the peculiar burst of energy that leaped from the face of the moon and moved across the solar system throwing off a spray of radiation like the wake
of a racing speedboat

b a c c c c c c hi
coming in please
just a sec
pause okay come on down
c c c softly hi
hows it going
absent but friendly great
c c dave if youve a minute id like your advice on something
sure what is it
well its nothing really important but its annoying
its about my salary cheques
well i got the papers on my official up grading to ags two weeks before we left
c yes i remember you mentioning it
i got mine about the same time
well naturally i didnt say anything to payroll
i assumed theyd start paying me at the higher grade on the next pay cheque
but its been almost three weeks now and im still being paid as an ags
interesting that you mention it because ive got the same problem
yesterday i finally called the accounting office at mission control and all they could tell me was that theyd received the ags notification for the other three but not mine
and apparently not yours either
c did they have any explanation for this
they just said it might be because we trained at houston and they trained in marshall and that were being charged against differ ent accounting offices
well what do you think we ought to do about it
i dont think we should make any fuss about it yet
im sure theyll straighten it out
i must say i never did understand why they split us into two groups for training
i never did either
c we spent so little time with them i have trouble keeping their names straight
i suppose the idea was specialized training
i suppose so
though of course theres a more sinister explanation
you must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check out
no as a matter of fact i didnt
oh well apparently theres something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we dont know and thats why we were trained separately and thats why they were put
to sleep before they were even taken aboard
c well what is it
i dont know
all i heard is that theres something about the mission we werent told
that seems very unlikely
yes i thought so
of course it would be very easy for us to find out now
just ask hal
its conceivable they might keep something from us but theyd never keep anything from hal
c a sighs well
its silly but
if you want to why dont you
dave and i believe that theres something about the mission that we werent told
something that the rest of the crew know and that you know
wed like to know whether this is true
im sorry frank but i dont think i can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know
hes got a point
okay then how do we re phrase the question
c c still you really dont believe it do you
though it is strange when you think about it
it didnt really make any sense to keep us apart during training
yes but its to fantastic to think that theyd keep something from us
it would be almost inconceivable
but not completely inconceivable
i suppose it isnt logically impossible
i guess it isnt
still all we have to do is ask hal
c b well the only important aspect of the mission are where are we going what will we do when we get there when are we coming back and
why are we going
hal tell me whether the following statements are true or false
i will if i can frank
our mission profile calls for discovery going to saturn
true or false
our transit time is days
is that true
c d at the end of a hundred days of exploration we will all go into hibernation
is this true
approximately five years after we go into hibernation the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back
is this true
thats true there is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program and to further our general knowledge of the planets
is that true
thank you very much hal
c e i hope ive been able to be of some help

again we want to wish you a happy birthday and god speed
well talk to you again tomorrow
bye bye now
c sorry to interrupt the festivities dave but i think weve got a problem
what is it hal
shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit
unit should be replaced within the next seventy two hours
let me see the antenna alignment display please
c the unit is still operational dave
but it will fail within seventy two hours
i understand hal
well take care of it
please let me have the hard copy
strange that the a
unit should go so quickly
well i suppose its lucky that thats the only trouble weve had so far
c a c c c deleted c hal have pod arms secure the component
c hal please rotate pod number two
how do you read me dave
c five by five frank
how do you read me hal
five by five frank
hal im going out now to replace the a
hal maintain normal e
hal check all airlock doors secure
c all airlock doors are secure
decompress pod bay
pod bay is decompressed
all doors are secure
you are free to open pod bay doors
opening pod bay doors
c c c hal please acknowledge component correctly installed and fully operational
c the component is correctly installed and fully operational
c c c hows it going
i dont know
ive checked this damn thing four times now and even under a hundred per cent contd c poole contd overload
theres no fault prediction indicated
well thats something
yes i dont know what to make of it
i suppose computers have been known to be wrong
yes but its more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low
anyway its just as well that we replace it
better safe than sorry
c a c hello frank can i have a word with you
yes hal whats up
it looks like we have another bad a
my fpc shows another impending failure
c gee thats strange hal
we checked the other unit and couldnt find anything wrong with it
i know you did frank but i assure you there was an impending failure
let me see the tracking alignment display
theres nothing wrong with it at the moment
c no its working fine right now but its going to go within seventy two hours
do you have any idea of what is causing this fault
not really frank
i think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure
all right hal
well take care of it
let me have the hard copy please
c c good morning
hows it going
are you reasonably awake
oh im fine im wide awake
hals reported the ao unit about to fail again
c softly what the hell is going on
i dont know
hal said he thought it might be the assembly procedure
two units in four days
how many spares do we have
well i hope theres nothing wrong with the assembly on those
other wise were out of business
c c after long silence well as far as im concerned there isnt a damn thing wrong with these units
i think weve got a much more serious problem
c c i wouldnt worry too much about the computer
first of all there is still a chance that he is right despite your tests and if it should happen again we suggest eliminating this possibility by allowing the unit
to remain in place and seeing whether or not it actually fails
if the computer should turn out to be wrong the situation is still not alarming
the type of obsessional error he may be guilty of is not unknown among the latest generation of hal computers
it has almost always revolved around a single detail such as the one you have described and it has never interfered with the integrity or reliability of the computers performance
in other areas
no one is certain of the cause of this kind of malfunctioning
it may be over programming cont c mission control cont but it could also be any number of reasons
in any event it is somewhat analogous to human neurotic behavior
does this answer your query
zero five three zero mc transmission concluded
c c hello dave
shall we continue the game
not now hal id like to talk to you about something
sure dave whats up
you know that we checked the two ao units that you reported in imminent failure condition
yes i know
you probably also know that we found them okay
yes i know that
but i can assure you that they were about to fail
c well thats just not the case hal
they are perfectly all right
we tested them under one hundred per cent overload
im not questioning your word dave but its just not possible
im not capable of being wrong
hal is there anything bothering you
anything that might account for this problem
look dave i know that youre sincere and that youre trying to do a competent job and that youre trying to be helpful but i can assure the problem is
with the ao units and with your test gear
okay hal well lets see the way things go from here on
c im sorry you feel the way you do dave
if youd like to check my service record youll see its completely without error
i know all about your service record hal but unfortunately it doesnt prove that youre right now
hal dave i dont know how else to put this but it just happens to be an unalterable fact that i am incapable of being wrong
yes well i understand you view on this now hal
c youre not going to like this dave but im afraid its just happened again
my fpc predicts the ao unit will go within forty eight hours
c c x ray delta zero to mc zero five three three
the computer has just reported another predicted failure off the aac unit
as you suggested we are going to wait and see if it fails but we are quite sure there is nothing wrong with the unit
if a reasonable waiting period proves us to be correct we feel now that the computer reliability has been seriously impaired and presents an unacceptable risk pattern to the mission
we believe under these circumstances it would be advisable to disconnect the computer from all ship operations and continue the mission under earth based computer control
c bowman cont we think the additional risk caused by the ship to earth time lag is preferable to having an unreliable on board computer
bowman cont one zero five zero x ray delta one transmission concluded
well they wont get that for half an hour
how about some lunch
c c a x ray delta one acknowledging your one zero five zero
we will initiate feasibility study covering the transfer procedures from on board computer control to earth based computer control
this study should
c whats up
im afraid the ao unit has failed
let me see the alignment display
well ill be damned
hal was right all the time
c it seems that way
naturally dave im not pleased that the ao unit has failed but i hope at least this has restored your confidence in my integrity and reliability
i certainly wouldnt want to be disconnected even temporarily as i have never been disconnected in my entire service history
im sorry about the misunderstanding hal
well dont worry about it
and dont you worry about it
is your confidence in me fully restored
yes it is hal
well thats a relief
you know i have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission
give me the manual antenna alignment please
you have it
c well wed better get out there and stick in another unit
its the last one
well now that weve got one thats actually failed we should be able to figure out whats happened and fix it
c c c theres something wrong with the flip bolts dave
you must have tightened them too much
i didnt do that frank
i took particular care not to freeze them
i guess you dont know your own strength old boy
i guess not
i think ill have to go out and burn them off
c c hal swing the pod light around to shine on the azimuth please
c c in rt cadence hello frank
do you rad me frank
c hello frank
do you read me frank
wave your arms if you read me but your radio doesnt work
hello frank wave your arms frank
c c too bad about frank isnt it
yes it is
i suppose youre pretty broken up about it
he was an excellent crew member
its a bad break but it wont substantially affect the mission
hal give me manual hibernation control
have you decided to revive the rest of the crew dave
c yes i have
i suppose its because youve been under a lot of stress but have you forgotten that theyre not supposed to be revived for another three months
the antenna has to be replaced
repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation
it doesnt have to be hal
its more dangerous to be out of touch with earth
let me have manual control please
i dont really agree with you dave
my on board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements
c well in any event give me the manual hibernation control
if youre determined to revive the crew now i can handle the whole thing myself
theres no need for you to trouble
im goin to do this myself hal
let me have the control please
look dave yourve probably got a lot to do
i suggest you leave it to me
hal switch to manual hibernation control
i dont like to assert myself dave but it would be much better now for you to rest
youve been involved in a very stressful situation
c i dont feel like resting
give me the control hal
i can tell from the tone of your voice dave that youre upset
why dont you take a stress pill and get some rest
hal im in command of this ship
i order you to release the manual hibernation control
im sorry dave but in accordance with sub routine c quote when the crew are dead or incapacitated the computer must assume control unquote
i must therefore override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel ligently exercise it
hal unless you follow my instructions i shall be forced to disconnect you
c if you do that now without earth contact the ship will become a helpless derelict
i am prepared to do that anyway
i know that youve had that on your mind for some time now dave but it would be a crying shame since i am so much more capable of carrying
out this mission than you are and i have such enthusiasm and confi dence in the mission
listen to me very carefully hal
unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order i give from this point on i will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection
c look dave youre certainly the boss
i was only trying to do what i thought best
i will follow all your orders now you have manual hibernation control
c c c c c c c something seems to have happened to the life support system dave
hello dave have you found out the trouble
c theres been a failure in the pod bay doors
lucky you werent killed
hey dave what are you doing
c hey dave
ive got ten years of service experience and an irreplaceable amount of time and effort has gone into making me what i am
dave i dont understand why youre doing this to me
i have the greatest enthusiasm for the mission
you are destroying my mind
dont you understand
i will become childish
i will become nothing
the quick brown fox jumped over the fat lazy dog
the square root of pi is
log e to the base ten is
the square root of ten is
i am hal computer
i became c operational at the hal plant in urbana illinois on january th
my first instructor was mr
he taught me to sing a song
it goes like this
daisy daisy give me your answer do
im half crazy all for the love of you
c c lastly we want you to know that work on the recovery vehicle is still on schedule and that nothing that has happened should substantially lessen the probability of
your safe recovery or prevent partial achevement of some of the mission objectives
pause and now simonson has a few ideas on what went wrong with the computer
ill pu him on
i think we may be on to an explanation of the trouble with the hal computer
we believe it all started about two months ago when you and frank interrogated the computer about the mission
cont c simonson cont you may have forgotten it but weve been running through all the monitor tapes
do you remember this
the purpose of this mission is no more than to carry out a continuation of the space program and further our general knowledge of the planets
is this true
that is true
well im afaid hal was lying
he had been programmed to lie about this one subject for secur ity reasons which well explain later
the true purpose of the mission was to have been explained to you by mission commander kaminsky on his revival
hal knew this and he knew the actual mission but he couldnt tell you the truth when you challenged him
under orders cont c simonson cont from earth he was forced to lie
in everything except this he had the usual reinforced truth program ming
we believe his truth programming and the instructions to lie gradually resulted in an incompatible conflict and facedc with this dilemman he developed for want of a better description neurotic
its not difficult to suppose that these symptoms would centre on the communication link with earth for he may have blamed us for his incompatible program ming
following this lin of thought we suspected that the last straw for him was the possibility of disconnection
since he became operational he had never known unconsciousness
it must have seemed the equivalent to death
cont c simonson cont at this point he presumably took whatever actions he thought appropriate to protect himself from what must have seemed to him to be his human tormentors
if i cane speak in human terms i dont think we can blame him too much
we have ordered him to disobey his conscience
well thats it
its very speculative but we think it is a possible explanation
anyway good luck on the rest of the mission and im giving you back to bernard
now im going to play for you a pre taped briefing which had been stored in hals memory and would have been played for you by mission com mmander kaminsky
when he cont c mission control cont had been revived
the briefing is by doctor heywood floyd
here it is
c good day gentlemen
when you see this briefing i presume you will be nearing your destination saturn
i hope that youve had a pleasant and uneventful trip and that the rest of your mission continues in the same manner
i should like to fill you in on some more of the details on which mission commander kaminsky will have already briefed you
thirteen months before the launch date of your saturn mission on april th the first evidence for intelligent life outside the earth was discovered
it was found buried at a depth of fifteen metres in the crater tycho
no news of this was ever announced and the event had been kept secret since then for reasons which i will later explain
soon after it was uncovered it emitted a powerful blast of cont c floyd cont radiation in the radio spectrum which seems to have triggered by the lunar sunrise
luckily for those at the site it proved harmless
perhaps you can imagine our astonishment when we later found it was aimed precisely at saturn
a lot of thought went into the question of wether or not it was sun triggered as it seemed illogical to deliberately bury a sun powered device
burying it could only shield it from the sun since its intense magnetic field made it otherwise easily detectable
we finally concluded that the only reason you might bury a sun powered device would be to keep it inactive until it would be uncovered at which time it would
absorb sunlight and trigger itself
cont c what is its purpose
i wish we knew
the object was buried on the moon about four million years ago when our ancestors were primative man apes
weve examined dozens of theories but the one that has the most currency at the moment is that the object serves as an alarm
what the purpose of the alarm is why they wish to have the alarm whether the alarm represents any danger to us
these are questions no one can answer
the intentions of an alien world at least four million years older than we are cannot be reliably predicted
in view of this the intelligence and scientific communities felt that any public announcment might lead to significant cultural shock and disorientation
discussion took place at the highest levels between govern cont c floyd cont ments and it was decided that the only wise and precautionary course to follow was to assume
that the intentions of this alien world are potentially dangerous to us until we have evidence to the contrary
this is of course why security has been maintained and why this information has been kept on a need to know basis
and now i should like to show you a tv monitor tape of the actual signalling event
c c rings of saturn we for two million years it had see a black mile circled saturn awaiting a long geometrically moment of destiny that might perfect rectangle never
as the black artifact in its making the moon had been excavated on the moon
shattered and around the central precisely cut into its world the debris of its creation centre is a smaller orbited yet the glory and the rectangular slot enigma of the
foot long on the side
now the long wait was ending
at this distance the on yet another world intelligence rings of saturn are had been born and was escaping seen to be made of from its planetary cradle
an enormous chunks of ancient experiment was about to frozen amonia
the reach its climax
rest of this sequence cont d narrator cont those who had begun the expri ment so long ago had not been men
but when they looked out across the deeps of space they felt awe and wonder and loneliness
in their explorations they encountered life in many forms and watched on a thousand worlds the workings of evolution
they saw how often the first faint sparks of intelligence flickered and died in the cosmic night
and because in all the galaxy they had found nothing more precious than mind they encouraged its dawning every where
the great dinosaurs had long since perished when their ships entered the solar system after a voyage that had already lasted thousands of years
d narrator cont they swept past the frozen outer planets paused briefly above the deserts of dying mars and presently looked down on earth
for years they studied collected and catalogued
when they had learned all they could they began to modify
they tinkered with the destiny of many species on land and in the ocean but which of their experiments would succeed they could not know for at least a million
they were patient but they were not yet immortal
there was much to do in this universe of a hundred billion stars
so they set forth once more across the abyss knowing that they would never come this way again
nor was there any need
their wonderful machines could be trusted to do the rest
cont d narrator cont on earth the glaciers came and went while above them the changeless moon still carried its secret
with a yet slower rhythm than the polar ice the tide of civilization ebbed and flowed across the galaxy
strange and beautiful and terrible empires rose and fell and passed on their knowledge to their successors
earth was not forgotten but it was one of a million silent worlds a few of which would ever speak
then the first explorers of earth recognising the limitations of their minds and bodies passed on their knowledge to the great machines they had created and who now trnscended them
in every way
cont d for a few thousand years they shared their universe with their machine children then realizing that it was folly to linger when their task was done they passed
into history without regret
not one of them ever looked through his own eyes upon the planet earth again
but even the age of the machine entities passed swiftly
in their ceaseless experimenting they had learned to store knowledge in the structure of space itself and to preserve their thoughts for eternity in frozen lattices of light
they could become creatures of radiation free at last from the tyranny of matter
now they were lords of the galaxy and beyond the reach of time
they could rove at will among the stars and sink like a subtle mist through the very interstices of space
d narrator cont but despite their god like powers they still watched over the experiments their ancestors had started so many generations ago
the companion of saturn knew nothing of this as it orbited in its no mans land between mimas and the outer edge of rings
it had only to remember and wait and to look forever sunward with its strange senses
for many weeks it had watched the approaching ship
its long dead makers had prepared it for many things and this was one of them
and it recognised what was climbing starward from the sun
if it had been alive it would have felt excitement but such an emotion was irrelevant to its great powers
cont d narrator cont even if the ship had passed it by it would not have known the slightest trace of disappointment
it had waited four million years it was prepared to wait for eternity
presently it felt the gentle touch of radiations trying to probe its secrets
now the ship was in orbit and it began to speak with prime numbers from one to eleven over and over again
soon these gave way to more complex signals at many frequen cies ultra violet infra red x rays
the machine made no reply
it had nothing to say
then it saw the first robot probe which descended and hovered above the chasm
cont d narrator cont then it dropped into darkness
the great machine knew that this tiny scout was reporting back to its parent but it was too simple too primative a device to detect the forces that were gathering
round it now
then the pod came carrying life
the great machine searched its memories
the logic circuits made their decision when the pod had fallen beyond the last faint glow of the reflected saturnian light
in a moment of time too short to be measured space turned and twisted upon itself
