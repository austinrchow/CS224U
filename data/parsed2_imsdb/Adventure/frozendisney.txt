written by jennifer lee final shooting draft were underwater looking up at it
a saw cuts through heading right for us
ice harvesters dressed in traditional sami clothing score a frozen lake
the frozen heart ice workers song the men drag giant ice blocks through channels of water
watch your step
let it go
a young sami boy kristoff and his reindeer calf sven share a carrot as they try to keep up with the men
watch your step
let it go
young kristoff struggles to get a block of ice out of the water
he fails ends up soaked
sven licks his wet cheek
a sharp ice floe overtakes the workers threateningly
they fight it back
massive fjord horses drag heavy ice plows
lee the sun sets
lanterns are lit
in the dark kristoff and sven finally manage to get a single block of ice out of the water
the workers pile onto the giant horse drawn ice sled as it pulls away
left behind kristoff and sven push their ice block onto a dinky little sled then head off
we sweep up from them to the northern lights filling the sky
then move across the mountains
beneath the snowline
and descend upon
a humble castle built of wood nestled in a deep fjord
elsa sleeps in her bed
her little sister anna pops up beside her
elsa doesnt stir
anna sits on elsa and bounces
grumbling anna go back to sleep
anna rolls onto her back and spreads all her weight on elsa
lee drama queen ish i just cant
the skys awake so im awake so we have to play
go play by yourself
elsa shoves anna off the bed
anna lands butt to floor sighs defeated
but then she gets an idea
she hops back on the bed and lifts one of elsas eyelids
mischievously do you want to build a snowman
elsas eyes both pop open
anna now wearing snow boots pulls elsa by the hand
come on come on come on come on
elsa tries to shush her but annas too excited
the girls sneak into the ballroom
elsa shuts the door
do the magic
do the magic
elsa laughs and waves her hands together
snowflakes suddenly burst forth and dance between her palms forming a snowball
elsa throws the snowball high into the air
snow bursts out and flurries around the room
anna dances about catching flakes in her palms and mouth
this is amazing
elsa stomps her little slippered foot and a layer of ice suddenly coats the floor forming a giant ice rink
anna slides off laughing
lee anna and elsa roll giant snowballs and build a snowman together
elsa moves his stick arms around
goofy voice hi im olaf and i like warm hugs
anna jumps up and hugs him
i love you olaf
anna and olaf appear to be dancing
reveal elsa is actually propelling them across the ice floor with her magic
the girls slide down snowbanks together
anna fearlessly jumps off a snow peak into mid air
elsa makes another peak to catch anna
anna keeps jumping
elsa keeps casting magic
jumping faster again
struggling to keep up slow down
elsa suddenly slips
her magic accidentally strikes anna in the head
anna tumbles down a snowbank and lands unconscious
elsa runs to anna and takes her in her arms
a streak of annas hair where struck turns white
the room around them fills with frightening ice spikes
lee the parents burst through the frozen door
gasp at the sight of the room
elsa what have you done
this is getting out of hand
seeing anna anna
the king and queen rush to anna and take her in their arms
it was an accident
im sorry anna
about anna shes ice cold
i know where we have to go
the king sifts through a shelf to find an ancient book inscribed with old norse runes
he opens the book scrambles to a page with an ancient map
carrying the girls the king and queen ride their horses out of the kingdom
snow streams from elsas hands leaving a trail of ice behind them
a sleepy kristoff and sven travel alone through the dark woods
all of a sudden the king and queen race by with the girls leaving the wake of ice
lee kristoff rides sven as they follow the trail of ice
kristoff hops off sven at the edge of a deep valley
they hide behind a rock and peek out
down below the king holds a frightened elsa
the queen holds the still unconscious anna
suddenly a bunch of rocks tumble down the valley toward them
it looks as though theyll be crushed
but luckily the rocks stop at their feet
the rocks then unfold revealing bright faces
the rock in front of kristoff wakes up
im trying to listen
she grabs kristoff and sven by hand and hoof and hugs them close
sven licks her face and she eyes them both
im gonna keep you
back below the crowd parts for a troll as old as the earth
they call him grand pabbie
he approaches arthritically but determined
he nods respectfully to the king
referring to elsa born with the powers or cursed
and theyre getting stronger
grand pabbie motions for the queen to bring anna to him
he examines her
lee about anna you are lucky it wasnt her heart
the heart is not so easily changed but the head can be persuaded
do what you must
i recommend we remove all magic even memories of magic to be safe
but dont worry ill leave the fun
grand pabbie pulls out a glowing blue energy from annas head
we see her memories floating right above her
grand pabbie changes all of her magical memories to ordinary memories snowy play indoors with the girls in their nightgowns changes to outdoors on the winter fjords with the girls
in winter gear
he puts the ordinary memories back in her head
she will be okay
but she wont remember i have powers
its for the best
listen to me elsa your power will only grow
as he speaks he conducts the northern lights to show a silhouette of an adult elsa creating magical snowflakes
there is beauty in your magic
but also great danger
the snowflakes turn to sharp spikes
you must learn to control it
in the northern lights display the sharp spikes cause human figures to panic and attack elsa
fear will be your enemy
lee elsa gasps and buries her face in the kings chest
the king wraps his arms around elsa protectively
well protect her
she can learn to control it
over the kings words we
the arendelle castle gates shutting
until then well lock the gates
well reduce the staff
we will limit her contact with people and keep her powers hidden from everyone
the castle shutters close
anna sits on her bed as elsas furniture disappears
anna rushes to the hall to see elsa shut the door to her new room
anna watches confused and sad
we look out on a gentle snowfall
little anna skips up to the window
she lights up at the sight of the snow and rushes down the hall
anna knocks on elsas door and sings
do you want to build a snowman
anna peeks under the door
annas room anna plays with two dolls gives up sad
anna peeks through the key hole
anna calls through the keyhole
go away anna
hearbroken behind the door day
elsa sits at the window looking out longingly
suddenly her icy hands freeze the windowsill
the king slips leather gloves onto elsas hands
the gloves will help
he pats her gloved hand
starting their mantra conceal it
dont feel it
dont let it show
hallway elsas door day
anna now knocks on elsas door
alone anna rides a bicycle built for two in the hall by standing on the back seat
portrait room day
anna runs around the portrait room gaining momentum to flip over the arm of the couch
anna lands plop on the cushions then looks up at the painting above her of the courageous joan of arc
hang in there joan
empty library day
looks like no ones around
but then we find anna laying at the base of the grandfather clock playing with her braids bored out of her mind
annas eyes follow the grandfather clocks pendulum
elsas room night
elsa now paces as she panics
the entire wall is frozen behind her
its getting stronger
getting upset only makes it worse
the king goes to hug her
dont touch me
i dont want to hurt you
he and the queen look at each other with alarmed sadness
anna now a teenager slides past elsas room without stopping
king and queens quarters day
anna runs into the room and throws herself into her parents arms
see you in two weeks
elsas room day
elsa curtsies in front of her parents formally not touching them
do you have to go
youll be fine elsa
the king and queen leave on a ship
rough seas night
the sea rages in a storm
the king and queens ship is lost in the waves
a portrait of the king and queen is covered in mourning cloth
anna looks small standing before her people beside burial stones
hallway elsas door
anna still in her mourning clothes approaches and knocks
please i know youre in there anna slides down the door and sits with her head against it
weak internal we move through the door
elsas room day
elsa is sitting in the exact same pose as anna
her bedroom is frozen with ice
snowflakes hang in the air suspended by grief
lee a new dawn rises over the fjords
ships pull up to the docks
guests pile out
welcome to arendelle
a boy tries to get away as his mother tries to stuff him in his bunad jacket
why do i have to wear this
because the queen has come of age
its coronation day
thats not my fault
they pass the may pole being raised and a sami ice harvester chatting with his reindeer
we recognize them as kristoff and sven all grown up
sven hops around excitedly like a dog and nuzzles kristoffs chest
what do you want sven
kristoff leans in and speaks for sven as if he can
give me a snack
whats the magic word
kristoff pulls a carrot out of his shirt pocket and hands it to sven
sven tries to bite the whole thing
hey hey hey
sven takes a smaller bite
kristoff then has a bite himself not seeming to care that its covered in reindeer slobber
we move on to persi and aggie a super excited couple who rush towards the castle
lee i cant believe theyre finally opening up the gates
and for a whole day
they pass a tiny but menacing duke who wears taps on his shoes to enhance his presence
two thug guards follow close behind him
ah arendelle our most mysterious trade partner
open those gates so i may unlock your secrets and exploit your riches
catching himself did i just say that out loud
we leave him and head down the bridge towards the castle gates passing an irishman and a spanish dignitary
oh me sore eyes cant wait to see the queen and the princess
i bet theyre absolutely lovely
i bet they are beautiful
we move past them to a particular castle window
anna sits up
shes got major bedhead
pulls a hair from her mouth
sorry to wake you maam but no you didnt
ive been up for hours
lee she falls back asleep while sitting
her head drops startling her awake
who is it
its still me maam
time to get ready
ready for what
your sisters coronation maam
my sisters cor neration
one eye opens enough to catch sight of her coronation dress
she bolts wide awake in excitement
anna bursts out of her room wearing her coronation dress
she finishes pinning ribbons in her hair
seeing the hustle and bustle of preparations she cant help but sing
for the first time in forever anna slides along the floor of the ballroom in her socks
she shakes hands with a suit of armor
hides the evidence
lee anna comes to a window and jumps out onto a window washers pulley
she raises herself up to see the ships arriving
anna walks through the garden and follows a family of geese
speaking i cant wait to meet everyone
gasp what if i meet the one
anna twists herself in a velvet drape like its a gown
she acts like she looks gorgeous but she looks ridiculous
she notices the bust of a man across the room
google eyed mouth full of chocolate she grabs the bust of the man and swings it around
the bust goes flying and lands on the top of the cake
anna bursts into the portrait room bounces on the furniture and interacts with the paintings
elsa now a very poised watches out the window as the coronation guests arrive
elsa moves to a painting of her fathers coronation
she takes off her gloves and mimics the painting by holding a candlestick and ornament in place of an orb and scepter
the candlestick and ornament ice over
elsa gasps slams them back down onto the table
she tries to reassure herself
we cut between annas excitement and elsas nerves
finally the gates are open
anna moves through the crowd admiring the people around her
lee anna hurries over the bridge and into the village square
anna slams right into the breast of a horse
she falls back and lands in a small wooden boat
it tips off of the dock
shes heading overboard
but just then the horse slams his hoof into the boat and steadies it
im so sorry
are you hurt
the rider hans sure is handsome and regal
i ya no
are you sure
yeah i just wasnt looking where i was going
but im okay
he hops down from his horse and steps into the boat
im great actually
lee oh thank goodness
he offers her a hand and their eyes meet
he helps her to her feet
bowing prince hans of the southern isles
curtseying princess anna of arendelle
he drops to his knees head bowed
the horse bows too curling his hoof up and out of the boat
the boat tips
hans tumbles on top of anna
the horse slams his foot back into the boat to stabilize it
anna and hans tumble the other way
anna lands on top of him
this is awkward
not youre awkward but just because were im awkward
did she just say that
hans quickly gets to his feet and helps anna up again
id like to formally apologize for hitting the princess of arendelle with my horse
and for every moment after
im not that princess
i mean if youd hit my sister elsa that would be yeash
cuz you know
patting the horse hello
lee to hans but lucky you its its just me
hans smiles amused
she smiles back
the bells ring
she doesnt notice at first shes too busy drinking in hanss handsomeness
i i i better go
i have to
i better go
she hurries off stops turns back
gives hans a little wave
as she rushes off again hans waves back
the horse waves too once again taking his hoof out of the boat
the boat falls with hans in it
it lands upside down in the water
hans raises it up off of him gasping for air
elsa stands at the alter
anna stands off to one side
she peeks out to the audience
hans waves at her from the pews
hes changed his clothes
the crown is placed on elsas head
the scepter and orb are presented to elsa on a pillow
she slowly reaches for them
a whisper your majesty the gloves
she breathes nervously removes her gloves places them on the pillow
her hands shake
she takes the orb and scepter then turns to the people
formal in old norse sehm hon hell drr in um hell gum ayg num ok krund ee thes um hell gah stahth ehk teh frahm fur ear u thear
lee the scepter and orb start to freeze over
queen elsa of arendelle
queen elsa of arendelle
just in time
elsa manages to set the orb and scepter back down on the pillow before anyone notices the ice
she picks up her gloves and slips them on
she made it
springy music fills the great hall
announcing queen elsa of arendelle
elsa enters poised and looking surprisingly content
she stands under a formal awning
princess anna of arendelle
anna runs into the room waves awkwardly
kai ushers her over to stand right next to elsa
are you sure
she and elsa sneak awkward peeks at each other
you look beautiful
you look beautifuller
i mean not fuller
you dont look fuller but more beautiful
lee thank you
they look out at the celebration
so this is what a party looks like
its warmer than i thought
and what is that amazing smell
they both close their eyes and inhale
their eyes pop open
elsa looks back out at the party
anna looks at elsa
she wants to say so much but she cant think of where to start
just as she finds her way kai interrupts
the duke of weaseltown
the duke of weselton
to elsa your majesty as your closest partner in trade it seems only fitting that i offer you your first dance as queen
the duke does a funny flitter of his feet a hitch kick and a deep bow
whispers to himself one two three
as he holds out his hand head down his toupee dips forward
elsa looks at anna stifles a giggle herself
to the duke thank you
only i dont dance
lee offended oh
but my sister does
oh i dont think the duke grabs annas arm and yanks her away before she can protest
if you swoon let me know ill catch you
anna looks back at elsa desperately
out on the dance floor the duke showboats but hes just awful
anna tries to make the best of it
like an agile peacock
cluck he lands on her feet
speaking of so great to have the gates open
why did they shut them in the first place
do you know the reason
he gets in her face suspicious
lee oh all right
they dont call me the little dipper for nothing
he dips anna back
elsa peeks through the crowd can barely hold in her laughter
anna shoots elsa funny help me looks
groove fully on like a chicken
with the face of a monkey
anna limps back to elsa
let me know when youre ready for another round mlady
well he was sprightly
rubbing her sore feet especially for a man in heels
are you okay
loving elsas attention ive never been better
this is so nice
i wish it could be like this all the time
sincere me too
but then elsa catches herself
she stiffens up looks away
but it cant
if it just cant
lee annas smile drops
she tries not to get emotional
excuse me for a minute
she walks away
elsa watches her go saddened
moving through the crowd anna gets bumped by a bowing mans butt
just before she hits the floor hans catches her
he smiles perfectly
glad i caught you
he smoothly sets his drink down on a passing tray
he lifts her up and leads her in a romantic dance
later anna and hans drink and chat
i often had the whole parlor to myself to slide
she hits him in the face by mistake with her hand
the castle doors anna and hans stroll out of the castle
your physique helps im sure
the rose garden
hans notices her white streak
about her white streak whats this
i was born with it although i dreamt i was kissed by a troll
i like it
lee anna teaches hans how to eat krumkake
yeah the whole thing
you got it
they laugh as the krumkake crumbles in his face
okay wait wait
so you have how many brothers
twelve older brothers
three of them pretended i was invisible
for two years
its what brothers do
elsa and i were really close when we were little
but then one day she just shut me out and i never knew why
he takes her hand
leans in close
i would never shut you out
okay can i just say something crazy
i love crazy
love is an open door singing i was thinking the same thing because like
lee they jump to the neighboring balcony and enter a door
they come out on top of one of the castles towers
cut to them sliding across an empty hallway in their socks
they hop up on the castle roof and watch a shooting star
lee thats what i was gonna say
they slide down the back of the roof out of sight
we next find them strutting on a bridge ledge
are they doing the robot
theyre imitating the mechanical figures on the clock tower
anna and hans dance on top of the lighthouse and cast dancing shadows across the sails of ships in the docks
lee they play hide and seek amongst the stable doors
they climb to the waterfall looking out over the kingdom
anna raises up her hands to frame the moon
hans puts his hands on top of hers
together their hands form a heart
can i say something crazy
will you marry me
can i just say something even crazier
lee anna pushes through the crowd towards elsa hans in tow
can we just get around you there
oh there she is
elsa turns to anna
anna curtseys awkwardly
may i present prince hans of the southern isles
bowing your majesty
elsa gives a polite but reserved curtsey
we would like your blessing of our marriage
im sorry im confused
well we havent worked out all the details ourselves
well need a few days to plan the ceremony
of course well have soup roast and ice cream and then wait
would we live here
anna oh we can invite all twelve of your brothers to stay with us what
no no no no no
of course we have the room
i dont know
some of them must wait
no ones brothers are staying here
no one is getting married
may i talk to you please
anna sees hanss worried face
hooks arms with him
whatever you have to say you you can say to both of us
you cant marry a man you just met
you can if its true love
anna what do you know about true love
more than you
all you know is how to shut people out
you asked for my blessing but my answer is no
now excuse me
lee your majesty if i may ease your flustered no you may not
and i i think you should go
elsa walks away
as she passes the royal handler the party is over
close the gates
anna grabs elsas hand
she pulls off elsas glove
elsa gasps spins around and reaches for the glove in panic
give me my glove
anna holds the glove away from elsa
desperate elsa please
i cant live like this anymore
elsa fights tears
weak then leave
elsa sees annas hurt face
its too much
she cant hold it in
she turns and rushes away
heartbroken what did i ever do to you
the party goes silent as everyone watches the sisters
why do you shut me out
why do you shut the world out
what are you so afraid of
i said enough
lee ice shoots from elsas hand spikes across the floor
guests cry out in shock back away
ducking behind his men sorcery
i knew there was something dubious going on here
elsa rushes out of the room
elsa bursts out of the castle door
the citizens cheer
there she is
long live the queen
come drink with us
elsa ducks through the crowd holding her bare hand
are you all right
elsa backs away from the baby
she knocks into the fountain grabs its edge
the waters freeze at her touch
gasps of shock and fear sweep over the crowd
the duke and thugs come out the door
there she is
to the duke please just stay away from me
magic accidentally shoots from her hand and turns the staircase into ice
the thugs and the duke fall
lee the crowd panics
a snowstorm begins
anna runs out of the palace doors carrying the glove
hans follows closely behind her
gates to the kingdom elsa runs out of the gates and down to the waters edge
the shoreline freezes under her feet
anna calls to her from the gates
elsa glances back at anna but turns away
she tentatively steps out onto the fjord
it freezes instantly
she breaks into a run as the water freezes over with each step
anna rushes out onto the fjord ice slips falls
hans rushes to annas side
elsa reaches the far shore
she doesnt look back
she just scrambles into the mountains
the ice spreads out until the entire fjord is frozen locking the ships in place
hans and anna move through the panicking crowd
lee are you all right
in shock no
did you know
nearby the duke flutters about in fright
the queen has cursed this land
she must be stopped
to his thugs you have to go after her
anna rushes up to the duke
the duke hides behind his thugs and points out at anna
is there sorcery in you too
are you a monster too
im completely ordinary
thats right she is
realizing how that sounds in the best way
and my sisters not a monster
she nearly killed me
you slipped on ice
lee it was an accident
she was scared
she didnt mean it
she didnt mean any of this
tonight was my fault
i pushed her
so im the one that needs to go after her
to the royal handler bring me my horse please
its too dangerous
elsas not dangerous
ill bring her back and ill make this right
the royal handler brings anna her horse and a cloak
im coming with you
no i need you here to take care of arendelle
he sees the desperation in her eyes
on my honor
she throws on the cloak and hops right onto the horse coronation dress and all
to the crowd i leave prince hans in charge
before letting her go are you sure you can trust her
i dont want you getting hurt
shes my sister she would never hurt me
lee she snaps the reins and rides out
hans watches after her
the snow picks up and overtakes our view
we push through a blizzard
lose our way
then finds ourselves
well above the snow line a small figure climbs the highest peak
finally she stops looks around
catches her breath and sings
let it go elsa takes off her glove and throws it into the air
elsa creates a snowman just like the one she made with anna when they were children
elsa lets her cape fly back into the wind
lee elsa creates ice steps and climbs them
elsa slams her foot down and forms a giant snowflake
in a flurry of creative release she raises the snowflake on ice beams builds walls archways a glistening chandelier and an intricate ceiling that leaves the sky visible
standing firmly in her mighty ice palace elsa removes her crown and throws it
back to resolve she takes down her hair and creates a new dress made of ice
the sun rises
elsa struts onto out onto a balcony and into the light
lee she turns and slams her ice palace door on us
anna rides her horse through two feet of snow
its me anna
your sister who didnt mean to make you freeze the summer
its all my f f f f f f fault
later anna and the horse struggle through a wooded area
hearing a wolf howl of course none of this would have happened if shed just told me her secret
shes a stinker
a branch of a nearby tree snaps and startles the horse
anna goes flying off lands face down in the snow
she sits up
spits out snow
sees the horse running away
he doesnt come back
anna grabs onto a branch of a leaning conifer tries to pull herself to her feet but the tree snaps upright and releases all its snow onto her
the northern lights shine as anna struggles out of breath reaching the top of a hill
lee snow it had to be snow she couldnt have had tr tr tropical magic that covered the f f fjords in white sand and warm she sees smoke rising
up in the distance
anna goes tumbling down the hill
she lands with a crash in an icy stream at the bottom
from inside the snowball cold cold cold cold cold
anna shuffles up to the building her dress frozen stiff
she shakes the snow off a sign and reads wandering oakens trading post
snow drops off a smaller sign
she reads it happily
anna steps cautiously through the door which hits her frozen butt and knocks her into the center of the shop
she looks around sees only summer supplies
anna turns to see a bright faced fellow sitting low behind the counter fingers tapping tip to tip
big summer blow out
half off swimming suits clogs and a sun balm of my own invention yah
for now how about boots
lee slight disappointment that would be in our winter department
the winter department contains one outfit a pick ax and a lonely pair of boots
um i was just wondering has another young woman the queen perhaps i dont know passed through here
she brings the clothes and boots to the counter
only one crazy enough to be out in this storm is you dear
the front door suddenly blows open and in walks a mass of a man covered in ice
underneath is kristoff
you and this fellow
big summer blow out
kristoff walks right up to anna
in her face carrots
anna moves out of kristoffs way
he grabs a bunch of carrots tosses them on the counter then moves through the place gathering other supplies
to kristoff a real howler in july yah
where ever could it be coming from
the north mountain
lee to herself north mountain
kristoff brings his supplies to the counter
oaken counts on his fingertips
thatll be forty
sweet as pie oh dear thats no good
see these are from our winter stock where supply and demand have a big problem
you want to talk about a supply and demand problem
i sell ice for a living
kristoff motions out the window where we see the blocks of ice on his sled covered in snow
ooh thats a rough business to be in right now
i mean that is really
he shoots her a look ahem
but i will throw in a visit to oakens sauna
kristoff and anna turn to see a naked family waving through the window of the steaming sauna
tens all i got
help me out
isolating the carrots ten will get you this and no more
lee okay just tell me one thing what was happening on the north mountain
did it seem magical
kristoff pulls down his scarf and gives anna a firm answer
now back up while i deal with this crook here
oaken stands up revealing his seven foot stature
what did you call me
oaken stomps out the door carrying kristoff with one arm
okay im ow
oaken throws kristoff who face plants in the snow
oaken slams the door
kristoff sits up
his reindeer sven canters over snorts and nudges him expectantly
no sven i didnt get your carrots
sven huffs in his face
kristoff turns away and sees something
he points to a dilapidated barn
but i did find us a place to sleep
and its free
anna stands watching oaken and all his great height as he squeezes behind the counter and sits down low again
teddy bear im sorry about this violence
i will add a quart of lutefisk so well have good feelings
just the outfit and boots yah
lee anna looks between kristoffs supplies and the door
kristoff now unfrozen relaxes on a bed of hay playing his lute and singing to and for sven
reindeer s are better than people throwing his voice speaking oh thanks buddy
singing as kristoff as sven as kristoff as sven as kristoff the door opens
kristoff sits up with a start
sees who it is
oh its just you
what do you want
i want you to take me up the north mountain
lee i dont take people places
he lays back down closes his eyes
let me rephrase that
a sack of supplies lands in kristoffs lap
he sits up
looks in the bag
take me up the north mountain
he eyes her
he clearly doesnt take orders
look i know how to stop this winter
he considers lies back down pulls his hat over his eyes
we leave at dawn
and you forgot the carrots for sven
a bag of carrots hits kristoff in the face
i didnt catching herself we leave now
she steps back outside and waits anxiously
annoyed kristoff offers sven a carrot
sven has a bite
then kristoff has a bite contemplating
sven races top speed up a narrow cliff pulling the sled which skids precariously
kristoff mans the reins
anna sits beside him
lee trying to scare anna hang on
we like to go fast
fearless i like fast
anna leans back and puts her feet up on the dashboard
get your feet down
he pushes her feet down
this is fresh lacquer
seriously were you raised in a barn
kristoff spits on the dash to clean it
the spit flies back and hits anna in the face
grossed out ew
no i was raised in a castle
she wipes off her face
so tell me what made the queen go all ice crazy
oh well it was all my fault
i got engaged but then she freaked out because id only just met him you know that day
and she said she wouldnt bless the marriage wait
you got engaged to someone you just met
anyway i got mad and so she got mad and then she tried to walk away and i grabbed her glove hang on
you mean to tell me you got engaged to someone you just met
but the thing is she wore the gloves all the time so i just thought maybe she has a thing about dirt
didnt your parents ever warn you about strangers
anna eyes kristoff up and down then slides away from him
yes they did
but hans is not a stranger
whats his last name
of the southern isles
whats his favorite food
best friends name
foot size doesnt matter
have you had a meal with him yet
what if you hate the way he eats
what if you hate the way he picks his nose
picks his nose
lee and eats it
excuse me sir
hes a prince
all men do it
look it doesnt matter its true love
doesnt sound like true love
are you some sort of love expert
but i have friends who are
you have friends who are love experts
im not buying it
sven suddenly stops ears perked in alarm
to anna stop talking
no no no
id like to meet these kristoff clamps his hand over annas mouth
i mean it
kristoff stands looks into the dark woods surrounding them
sensing something behind them he holds up his lantern
its light reflects off
sven takes off
what are they
lee flashes of white dart through the woods
kristoff hops into the back of the sled grabs a torch
what do we do
ive got this
dont fall off and dont get eaten
but i wanna help
because i dont trust your judgement
a wolf jumps at them but kristoff kicks it off
who marries a man she just met
anna grabs the lute swings it right at kristoffs head
its true love
he screams as she
swings past kristoff and knocks a wolf away
just then kristoff is yanked off the sled by another wolf
the torch goes flying
anna catches it shocked
kristoff grabs onto a loose rope hanging from the back of the sled and holds on for dear life as hes dragged behind
lee a wolf jumps on kristoffs back
anna thinks fast uses the torch to light a blanket on fire
anna throws the flaming blanket right at him
the blanket hits the wolves
they tumble off kristoff
you almost set me on fire
anna reaches out a hand pulls kristoff back onto the sled
but i didnt
sven cries out
there is a massive gorge ahead
get ready to jump sven
you dont tell him what to do
kristoff shoves a satchel into her arms then scoops her up
kristoff tosses anna onto sven then unhooks svens harness from the sled
sven jumps the gorge with anna on his back
kristoff goes flying off behind them still on the sled
anna and sven land safely on the other side of the gorge
kristoffs sled loses momentum
its not going to make it
he leaps off
he flaps his arms claws at the air
he slams into the snowy edge of the cliff
hanging by his hands he looks down to see his sled hit the ground far below and burst into flames
lee shocked sadness but i just paid it off
suddenly he starts to slip
he claws at the loose snow but its clearly hopeless
hes going down
no no no
to make matters worse an axe comes flying right at his face
the axe slams into the snow inches from his nose
kristoff grabs on
reveal the axe is tied to a rope then wrapped around sven
anna helps sven pull kristoff to safety
kristoff rolls onto his back exhausted
anna peeks down at the burning sled
ill replace your sled and everything in it
and i understand if you dont want to help me anymore
anna walks off sadly
sven comes over and nuzzles kristoff
of course i dont want to help her anymore
in fact this whole thing has ruined me for helping anyone ever again
but shell die on her own
i can live with that
lee through their conversation they watch anna go the wrong way
turn go the other wrong way turn trip
but you wont get your new sled if shes dead
knowing hes got a point you know sometimes i really dont like you
sven licks kristoff happily
to anna hold up
excited you are
catching herself i mean sure
ill let you tag along
kristoff sven and anna walk on a narrow rim of a mountain
as they step out of the thick trees anna catches sight of something far below
its completely frozen
but itll be fine
elsa will thaw it
lee uncertain yeah
now come on
this way to the north mountain
she points straight ahead
more like this way
he points her finger up towards a perilously mighty mountain
anna kristoff and sven walk beneath frozen willows
the hanging branches glisten like christmas lights
sven knocks them with his antlers
they tinkle like chimes
i never knew winter could be so beautiful
suddenly a voice comes in from nowhere
well call that voice olaf
it really is beautiful isnt it
but its so white
you know how about a little color
must we bleach the joy out of it all
im thinking like maybe some crimson chartreuse
while this is going on anna and kristoff look around for the source of the rambling
they look at sven could he actually be talking
sven looks back at them his antlers tangled in branches just as baffled as they are
in the meantime a nose less snowman olaf wanders up behind them
how bout yellow no not yellow
yellow and snow
he stops between kristoff and anna
they look down at him
how did he get there
he suddenly looks up at anna
am i right
lee anna screams
reflexes take over and she kicks olafs head sending it flying off his body and into kristoffs arms
cheery to kristoff hi
kristoff tosses the head back to anna and they commence a game of hot potato
i dont want it
please dont drop me
come on its just a head
olafs body runs at anna arms waving
all right we got off to a bad start
ew ew the body
anna slams olafs head back on the body upside down
olaf smiles happily then looks confused
wait what am i looking at right now
why are you hanging off the earth like a bat
wait one second
anna kneels in front of olaf and rights his head
now im perfect
she looks over his innocent face gets an idea
she digs into kristoffs satchel holds up a carrot just as olaf turns toward her
the carrot accidentally slams all the way through his head
i i i was just
are you okay
olaf sees a tiny piece of carrot sticking out between his eyes
he lights up
are you kidding me
i am wonderful
ive always wanted a nose
going cross eyed to look at his tiny nose so cute
its like a little baby unicorn
anna reaches behind olaf to the bulk of the carrot sticking out the back of his head and pushes it forward
seeing his now big nose oh i love it even more
all right lets start this thing over
and i like warm hugs
olaf opens his arms wide to anna
that triggers a memory
it takes her a moment to place it but then she does
thats right olaf
lee and you are
and whos the funky looking donkey over there
and whos the reindeer
olaf looks from kristoff to sven confused
theyre oh okay
accepting it makes things easier for me
sven tries to bite olafs nose
aw look at him tryin to kiss my nose
gushes i like you too
olaf did elsa build you
curious kristoff takes one of olafs twig arms off studies it
it seems to be moving in sync with his other arm
do you know where she is
studying the arm fascinating
lee do you think you could show us the way
bending the arm how does this work
olafs dismembered arm slaps kristoff across the face
stop it sven
trying to focus here
to anna yeah why
ill tell you why
we need elsa to bring back summer
sinking into wistfulness oh i dont know why but ive always loved the idea of summer and sun and all things hot
im guessing you dont have much experience with heat
but sometimes i like to close my eyes and imagine what itd be like when summer does come
olaf walks through a grassy meadow with the sun shining behind him
in summer frozen j
lee olaf now lies in the sand on a beach
olaf sails in a boat
olaf floats in the water
all his pieces begin to separate
olaf tumbles on a sandy beach with sand snowmen
olaf and the seagull break out into a tap dance
olaf and another snowman drink hot chocolate in a hot tub
olaf tap dances with a gaggle of seagulls
olaf bounds down a grassy hill
he stops at a puddle looks down at it
hops over it
lee olaf runs with a checkered blanket that he spreads out
he relaxes and stares at the blue sky
sven anna kristoff and olaf have a picnic
im gonna tell him
dont you dare
olaf sings the final note
we swing around him and return to reality
he then straightens up and smiles
so come on
elsas this way
lets go bring back summer
olaf grabs annas hand and pulls her along up the mountain
laughing im coming
sven hops along happily following them
kristoff watches all of them like theyre nuts
somebodys got to tell him
lee a layer of solid ice coats everything
people huddle around weak fires
anxiety runs high amongst the villagers and guests
we pass two citizens fighting over a woodpile
youve got the bark facing down
the bark needs to be face up
bark down is drier
like a light in the dark hans moves through the crowd
does anyone need a cloak
arendelle is indebted to you your highness
the castle is open
theres soup and hot glogg in the great hall
he hands the stack of cloaks to a guard
pass these out
just then the duke approaches hans
prince hans are we just expected to sit here and freeze while you give away all of arendelles tradable goods
tall and confident princess anna has given her orders and frozen j
lee and thats another thing has it dawned on you that your princess may be conspiring with a wicked sorceress to destroy us all
hanss nice eyes turn to threatening slits
do not question the princess
she left me in charge and i will not hesitate to protect arendelle from treason
flabbergasted offended treason
suddenly they hear the alarmed whinny of annas horse
it returns alone bucking and kicking
hans grabs its reins
various princess annas horse
what happened to her
where is she
hans steadies the horse looks up at the mountain
he sees all the panicked faces of the kingdom looking to him
princess anna is in trouble
calling out i need volunteers to go with me to find her
volunteers some from arendelle some from other lands rush up to offer their services
i volunteer two men my lord
quietly to his thugs be prepared for anything and should you encounter the queen you are to put an end to this winter
do you understand
his two thugs sneer
lee anna kristoff sven and olaf move through hostile terrain
wind swept icicles face horizontal
so how exactly are you planning to stop this weather
confident oh i am gonna talk to my sister
thats your plan
my ice business is riding on you talking to your sister
kristoff so stunned by her casual plan doesnt look where hes going and ends up with an ice spike to the nose
he stops short gulp moves carefully around the spike
so youre not at all afraid of her
why would i be
i bet elsas the nicest gentlest warmest person ever
olaf backs right into an icicle
it runs through his torso
oh look at that
ive been impaled
he laughs it off
anna and kristoff hit what looks like a dead end
the face of the mountain goes straight up
lee kristoff looks around sighs
digs in his rucksack
its too steep
ive only got one rope and you dont know how to climb mountains
sven nudges kristoff who looks up to see anna trying to climb the cliffs flat face
finding her ridiculous what are you doing
straining im going to see my sister
youre going to kill yourself
kristoff watches her searching for footholds and hand holds
i wouldnt put my foot there
youre distracting me
how do you know elsa even wants to see you
im just blocking you out cause i gotta concentrate here
you know most people who disappear into the mountains want to be alone
nobody wants to be alone
except maybe you im not alone
i have friends remember
anna kicks a foot above her head to catch a foot hold
lee you mean the love experts
yes the love experts
anna realizes shes stuck
please tell me im almost there
reveal shes only about six feet up
her muscles shake
does the air seem a bit thin to you up here
kristoff smiles getting a kick out of her
he pulls the rope from his bag
just then olaf steps out from behind a rock and waves to kristoff
not sure if this is going to solve the problem but i found a staircase that leads exactly where you want it to go
anna drops off the cliff
kristoff catches her
that was like a crazy trust exercise
she hops down brushes off her dress and bounds off
kristoff watches after her digging her fearless pluck
anna kristoff and olaf approach elsas elegant ice palace
in awe now thats ice
i might cry
lee go ahead
i wont judge
anna climbs the steps with olaf
sven tries to follow
his hooves slip out
he scrambles but cant get traction
kristoff runs to his aide
all right take it easy
kristoff settles sven back down the stairs and pats him
you stay right here buddy
sven obediently plops his reindeer butt down and wags his tail
kristoff climbs the stairs admiring the ice details
anna arrives at the door
she doesnt just knock
to kristoff why isnt she knocking
do you think she knows how to knock
anna finally knocks
the sound echoes inside
the ice doors slide open
thats a first
anna goes to step in
she gets a thought stops him
you should probably wait out here
last time i introduced her to a guy she froze everything
but its a palace made of ice
ice is my life
lee bye sven
olaf starts to head inside
anna stops him
you too olaf
just give us a minute
as anna walks inside
olaf starts counting
kristoff joins in
anna walks into a great foyer
the place is beautiful but also eerie
elsa steps out of the shadows onto a balcony
she sees anna looks to her longingly
anna cant help but be struck by elsas beauty
elsa you look different
its a good different
and this place is amazing
lee cautious polite thank you i never knew what i was capable of
anna starts to climb the stairs
im so sorry about what happened
if id known elsa backs up away from anna
on guard no its okay
you dont have to apologize
but you should probably go please
but i just got here
you belong in arendelle
so do you
anna takes another step up
elsa backs up more
no i belong here
where i can be who i am without hurting anybody
actually about that
what is that
olaf comes running in the front door
hi im olaf and i like warm hugs
olaf stops beside anna looks up at elsa intimidated
lee bashful you built me
you remember that
astonished and youre alive
i think so
anna kneels down beside olaf
hes just like the one we built as kids
we were so close
we can be like that again
elsa smiles but then a memory returns to her
flashback young anna is struck by elsas powers
young anna falls unconscious
young elsa races to her
the present elsas face sinks in pain
no we cant
elsa turns and heads up the second story steps
elsa wait calling back im just trying to protect you
elsa continues to flee
you dont have to protect me
im not afraid
please dont shut me out again
lee anna sings
first time in forever reprise they arrive on the top floor elsas main living space
elsa turns back to anna grateful but determined
anna yeah but i know
elsa opens up the balcony doors
elsa looks past annas shoulder out white peaked mountains
you kind of set off an eternal winter
its okay you can just unfreeze it
no i cant
i dont know how
sure you can
i know you can
snow starts to swirl around the room
panicking the snow picks up
anna tries to fight through it
lee but as anna sings we lose sight of her in the thickening blizzard taking over the room
annas voice disappears in the storm as elsa cries out
elsas fear so strong sucks the blizzard back into her and then it bursts out unwittingly like a sharp snowflake
anna is struck right in the heart
she grasps her chest in pain and stumbles back
she falls to her knees
elsa gasps when she sees anna
just then olaf and kristoff rush into the room to annas side
are you okay
lee im okay
anna gets to her feet determined to hide the pain
scared whos this
wait it doesnt matter
you have to go
no i know we can figure this out together desperate how
what power do you have to stop this winter
to stop me
anna doesnt have the answer
kristoff sees spiky ice shadows creeping down the walls
puts a protective arm around anna
anna i think we should go
close to tears no
im not leaving without you elsa
heartbroken but decisive yes you are
elsa waves her arms and builds a giant menacing snowman
well call him marshmallow
marshmallow holds anna and kristoff by the scruff of their necks in one hand and olaf in the other
put us down
to marshmallow you are a lot stronger than i think you realize
marshmallow tosses kristoff and anna down the steps
lee like a bouncer go away
anna and kistoff slide past sven whos got his tongue stuck to the ice railing
olafs head smashes into a snowbank nearby
watch out for my butt
anna and kristoff duck as the rest of olaf slams into the snowbank
marshmallow turns to go back into the castle
incensed anna tries to march back up the stairs
it is not nice to throw people
kristoff grabs her pulls her back
all right feisty pants
calm let me at him
i want to get down
just let the snow him
anna backs down
for a moment
then she grabs a snowball and throws it at marshmallow
the tiny little ball hits marshmallows back not making even the slightest dent
but its enough to infuriate him
spikes shoot out of his joints
now you made him mad
ill distract him
you guys go
kristoff pushes anna along
sven runs off in the opposite direction
olafs belly and butt fall and follow sven
no no not you guys
lee marshmallow goes charging after anna and kristoff as olafs head falls and lands face down in snow
muffled this just got a whole lot harder
anna and kristoff leap and slide down a steep slope
they tumble to a stop at the bottom just as marshmallow lands hard right behind them
theyre off again
through a maze of conifers that sag under the weight of the snow marshmallow hot on their trail
anna grabs a branch of a sagging trees and releases all of the snow
the tree snaps upright knocking marshmallow back
impressed ho ho ho
i got him
anna and kristoff burst out of the conifer forest and almost run right off a cliff
they stop short toes on the edge
its a hundred foot drop
its two hundred
kristoff ties the rope around anna and pulls tight
he drops to his knees and starts digging a u shape in the snow with a pick axe
whats that for
im digging a snow anchor
lee not trusting okay
what if we fall
theres twenty feet of fresh powder down there itll be like landing on a pillow
they hear an angry roar coming closer
anna preps for the jump like a boxer getting ready to fight
you tell me when
im ready to go
pumped up i was born ready
a huge tree flies through the air toward them
anna jumps and pulls kristoff over the edge with her
they hang upside down over the cliff by the rope
the rope catches their fall
back up top olaf emerges from the woods
hes a complete mess all his body parts are in the wrong places
he huffs and puffs struggling to run
man am i out of shape
lee he stops
puts his body back together in the right order
there we go
whered ya guys go
we totally lost marshmallow back there
marshmallow steps up behind olaf
olaf turns to face him
we were just talking about you
all good things all good things
marshmallow roars and approaches kristoffs snow anchor
olaf jumps onto marshmallows leg trying to stop him but not making much of a difference
this is not making much of a difference
marshmallow flicks olaf off his leg and right over the cliff
olaf passes anna and kristoff
hang in there guys
marshmallow starts yanking kristoff and annas rope up
kristoffs head hits the cliff
kristoff passes out and hangs like a rag doll
lee marshmallow pulls them up
he roars and breathes snow all over them
dont come back
grossed out by his snow breath ugh
anna whips out a knife and cuts the rope
kristoff comes to just as they fall
they both scream
reveal anna opens her eyes to find herself buried up to her shoulders in the soft thick snow
hey you were right
just like a pillow
she looks up to see olafs upper half hanging onto kristoffs boots which are sticking out of the snow
shaking the boots i cant feel my legs
i cant feel my legs
suddenly kristoffs head pops up
he spits out snow
those are my legs
olafs bottom goes running by
to kristoff ooh
hey do me a favor grab my butt
kristoff grabs olafs head and puts it on his body
oh that feels better
sven walks up and sniffs olafs nose
lee olaf turns to anna and kristoff just as sven goes to bite off his nose and misses
he found us
to sven funny voice whos my cute little reindeer
dont talk to him like that
kristoff goes over to help anna who is stuck in the snow
he lifts her out easily
they meet eyes
is that chemistry
hows your head
she touches the spot where he banged his head
in pain ah
he catches himself
waves off the pain with a giggle
i mean its fine
ive got a thick skull
i dont have a skull
the awkwardness is killing him
lee shy now what
shy now what
panicking now what
what am i gonna do
she threw me out
i cant go back to arendelle with the weather like this
and then theres your ice business hey hey dont worry about my ice business
noticing something worry about your hair
she thinks he means it looks bad
she smooths it down
i just fell off a cliff
you should see your hair
no yours is turning white
she grabs her braid as a tendril turns white
its because she struck you isnt it
does it look bad
olafs head pops up
hes holding his head up off his body to join the conversation
no i didnt
anna you need help
now come on
lee he heads towards the sunset
sven and olaf follow
where are we going
to see my friends
catching up the love experts
and dont worry theyll be able to fix this
how do you know
he looks her over remembering the moment he saw the trolls heal her as a child
because ive seen them do it before
as they round the bend the sun sets and olaf turns to sven
i like to consider myself a love expert
elsa paces distraught
she talks to herself
mantra style get it together
she hears ice cracking
shes left a sharp wake of ice spikes behind her on the floor
they grow up the wall taking over the castle
lee the northern lights are bright
olaf stares at them in awe as he rides on svens back
the skys awake
behind olaf and sven anna walks with kristoff
are you cold
he reaches like he might put an arm around her but decides against it
he looks around as if he doesnt know what to do then gets a thought
he takes her hand and pulls her around a bend into a rock lined pass
steam vents powered by the volcanic activity dot the path
he holds her hands over one of them
they continue on the path walking from vent to vent
taking a deep breath so about my friends
well i say friends theyre more like family
anyway when i was a kid it was just me and sven
until they took me in
moved they did
nervous ramble yeah
i dont want to scare you they can be a little bit inappropriate
theyre also stubborn at times and a little overbearing
really really heavy
lee but theyre fine
youll get it
they mean well
anna touches kristoffs arm reassuringly
kristoff they sound wonderful
kristoff smiles appreciating her sincerity
mustering the courage kristoff steps forward and with a wave of the arms announces meet my family
reveal hes surrounded by rocks
to the rocks hey guys
as kristoff and sven move through the rocks waving and greeting olaf and anna stand frozen dumbfounded
to herself theyre rocks
realizing hes crazy
covertly to anna ill distract them while you run
loud and slow to a rock hi svens family
its nice to meet you
quietly to anna anna because i love you i insist you run
to the rock i understand youre love experts
to anna why arent you running
anna snaps out of her shock and starts backing away
im gonna go just then the rocks around her start rolling
lee panicking kristoff
olaf lights up and chases the rocks who surround kristoff and unfold as trolls
its been too long
olaf jumps around all excitedly
excitedly kristoffs home
he then stops confused and looks to one of the trolls
anna watches shocked and confused
the trolls all want kristoffs attention
one troll yanks him down with a boulders strength
oh lemme look at you
another troll tries to pull off his clothes
oh take off your clothes kristoff i wash them
holding up his pants ah
im gonna keep my clothes on thank you
great to see you all
but look i grew a mushroom
and i earned my fire crystal
lee i passed a kidney stone
pick me up
the kid troll jumps up on kristoffs arm
kristoff sinks under the weight of him
anna still stares confused then realizes
all troll eyes turn to anna
hes brought a girl
hes brought a girl
suddenly anna is surrounded by trolls
they body surf roll anna over to kristoff
she falls into his arms
whats going on
ive learned to just roll with it
bulda climbs on top of her husband cliff to get a good look at anna
she studies her like shes a piece of cattle
let me see
yes yes yes
shell do nicely for our kristoff
youve got the wrong idea
thats not why i brought her here
im not anna laughs uncomfortable not knowing what to say
lee to anna whats the issue dear
why are you holding back from such a man
fixer upper can we just stop talking about this
weve got a real actual problem here
ill say to anna frozen j
lee no i dont
the girl trolls sweep anna away
the boys take kristoff
to the male trolls enough
shes engaged to someone else
the boy trolls turn huddle
lee kristoff looks over at anna
she actually looks shockingly beautiful dressed in moss lit by shimmering crystals
by this time kristoff and anna are being ushered into a pit by the sheer force of numbers
during this last bit anna and kristoff are looking at each other differently
maybe those trolls are right
do you anna take kristoff to be your trollfully wedded wait what
youre getting married
just then anna collapses
kristoff catches her
shes shivering something fierce
he pulls off her cape and hat
lee shes as cold as ice
just then grand pabbie pushes his way through the crowd
trolls clear the way for pabbie
he stops at the edge of the pit
theres strange magic here
bring her to me kristoff
kristoff helps anna over
pabbie looks into her weak eyes
anna your life is in danger
there is ice in your heart put there by your sister
if not removed to solid ice will you freeze forever
so remove it grand pabbie
if it was her head that would be easy
but only an act of true love can thaw a frozen heart
an act of true love
googley to her hubby a true loves kiss perhaps
a bunch of trolls give each other kisses
anna shivers again collapsing into kristoffs arms
more of her hair turns white
anna weve got to get you back to hans
still weak hans
lee help us out sven
kristoff grabs svens antlers
sven pulls them out
kristoff helps anna onto sven and hops up behind her
come on olaf
sven takes off
olaf grabs svens tail rides with them
lets go kiss hans
who is this hans
hans and the men tread cautiously towards the castle
we are here to find princess anna
be on guard but no harm is to come to the queen
do you understand
the dukes thugs exchange a look
suddenly a mass of snow rises from the ground behind hans
its marshmallow elsas snow guard
he slams a fist inches from hans
hans deftly dodges out of the way
all of the guards take up arms against marshmallow who quickly knocks them over
marshmallow throws down a guard and his horse who topple over hans
marshmallow raises his foot to stomp on hans but hans barrel rolls himself to safety
he sees his sword leaps and grabs it
just then elsa peeks out the front doors
the dukes two thugs see her
the thugs charge up the stairs
lee they guards burst through the ice doors
elsa flees to the top floor of her palace
the guards pursue
they trap her on the top floor raise their crossbows
one of the thugs shoots an arrow right at elsa
at the last moment she creates an ice wall
it stops the arrow inches from her face
the thugs reposition to take another shot
elsa shoots ice at the thugs
they duck out of the way and continue the attack
elsa fights for her life
back outside hans is nearly crushed by marshmallow
he rolls away
jumps to his feet
and with agile might he slices marshmallows leg off with his sword
marshmallow stumbles back off balance
and falls off over the cliff but not before striking hans
hans goes over the edge
reveal hans clings to the ice steps
his men help him up and they rush into the ice palace
elsa is surrounded
its do or die
in two swift moves elsa traps one thug in a cage of spikes that threaten his neck
the other she pushes back with a wall of ice
up against the balcony doors
which burst and crack
out onto the balcony
the balcony doors shatter
the thug is pushed to the edge
hes inches away from falling to his death
back inside hans and his men run in
see the destruction and the thugs near death
lee queen elsa
dont be the monster they fear you are
elsa snaps out of her rage
she sees the men frightened moments from death
elsa looks to hans overwhelmed frightened
the wall retreats from the thug on the balcony
the ice spikes lower from the second thugs neck
he takes advantage and aims his crossbow at elsas back
hans runs and pushes the crossbow up just as the arrow releases
the arrow hits the ice chandelier hanging directly above elsa
the chandelier comes crashing down
elsa dives out of the way but she falls in the blast
all we see is ice smashing like glass and all we hear is the sound of it shattering as it rings out
elsas face as her eyes flutter open
she sits up
shes surrounded by stone
elsa looks to the nearby window
tries to rush to it
shes pulled taut by giant shackles that fit like iron gloves
shes chained to the wall
elsa strains to looks out a window
inset window arendelle is outside frozen solid and getting further buried under the ice and snow that is falling
what have i done
he hangs a torch by the door
why did you bring me here
i couldnt just let them kill you
lee but im a danger to arendelle
anna has not returned
elsa looks to the storm with worry
if you would just stop the winter bring back summer
elsa meets his eyes desperate
dont you see
hans sees the sincerity in her eyes
you have to tell them to let me go
hans walks to the door
he takes the torch
i will do what i can
he opens the door and leaves
elsa distraught hears cracking
she looks down as her shackles begin to freeze over
the storm outside picks up
sven charges down the mountain with kristoff and anna on his back
olaf slides along beside them penguin style
anna shivers in kristoffs arms
kristoff takes off his hat and puts it on her head
just hang in there
to sven come on buddy faster
they arrive at the walls of arendelle
olaf slides past them out of control
ill meet you guys at the castle
lee stay out of sight olaf
he disappears into the village streets
guards see kristoff and anna approaching
its princess anna
sven skids to a stop outside the gates
kristoff slides off holding anna and carries her to the gate
ive got you
anna looks up at him gratefully
are you g gonna be okay
touched reassuring dont worry about me
just then the castle gates open
gerda kai and a handmaid rush to help anna
oh you had us worried sick
you are freezing
you poor girl youre freezing
lets get you inside
lee get her warm and find prince hans immediately
anna is swept away from kristoff and into the palace grounds
make sure shes safe
kristoff is shut out as the castle gates close on him
kristoff stands there with sven for a beat staring with worry at the closed gates
finally he sighs turns and walks off
sven reluctantly follows
hans stands with the dignitaries and guards
im going back out to look for princess anna
you cannot risk going out there again
if anything happens to her if anything happens to the princess you are all arendelle has left
hans hesitates realizing how much this kingdom has come to depend on him
is he really all they have left
just then the door opens and gerda and kai bring in anna
hes in here
lee hans rushes to anna
she falls into his arms
youre so cold
weak but desperate hans you have to kiss me
here we go
she tries to kiss him but is too weak to pull herself up in his arms
well give you two some privacy
everyone shuffles out leaving hans and anna alone
what happened out there
elsa struck me with her powers
you said shed never hurt you
i was wrong
anna crumbles weak
hans carries her to a couch sets her down
shivering more she froze my heart and only an act of true love can save me
understanding a true loves kiss
he takes her chin in his hand and gives her a tender smile
he leans in slowly
lee then he stops
if only there was someone out there who loved you
hans gets up leaving her there
you said you did
he goes to the window and shuts the curtains
as thirteenth in line in my own kingdom i didnt stand a chance
i knew id have to marry into the throne somewhere what are you talking about
putting out the candles as heir elsa was preferable of course
but no one was getting anywhere with her
but you hans
you were so desperate for love you were willing to marry me just like that
hans crosses the room grabs a pitcher of water from a table and goes to the fireplace
i figured after we married id have to stage a little accident for elsa
hans pours the water on the fireplace putting out the fire
anna tries to stop him
she falls to the floor weak
lee but then she doomed herself and you were dumb enough to go after her
chuckles all thats left now is to kill elsa and bring back summer
hans approaches anna
youre no match for elsa
he bends down takes her chin in his hand again this time not so gently
no youre no match for elsa
i on the other hand am the hero who is going to save arendelle from destruction
she wrenches her face out of his hands
anger you wont get away with this
hans rises and crosses to the door
oh i already have
hans leaves and shuts her in locking the door
anna struggles to the door yanks on the locked handle
hoarse and weak please somebody help
the rest of her hair turns white and she crumbles to the floor
lee the duke looks out the window at the growing snowstorm
he rubs his arms and shivers
its getting colder by the minute
if we dont do something soon well all freeze to death
hans comes in putting on his most distraught face
princess anna is
hans stumbles weak with grief
the men help him to a chair
what happened to her
she was killed by queen elsa
her own sister
really putting it on at least we got to say our marriage vows
before she died in my arms
he bows his head in a brilliant display of teary grief
there can be no doubt now queen elsa is a monster and we are all in grave danger
prince hans arendelle looks to you
hans nods he knows what hes being asked to do and hell do it with the perfect amount of authority and gravitas
lee with a heavy heart i charge queen elsa of arendelle with treason and sentence her to death
the cell ices over
elsa looks out at the storm that is devastating arendelle then hears the guards approaching
move quickly and with resolve
elsa pulls at her shackles
just as the door busts open the weight of the ice crumbles the walls
the men duck out of the way
hans pushes his way into the room
the back wall is blown open
broken shackles rest on the floor
elsa is gone
kristoff heads into the mountains
sven lags behind not wanting to follow
he looks back at the kingdom then shakes his head
he runs past kristoff
stops and turns to face him
he snorts and grunts
what is it buddy
sven nudges kristoff with his antlers
hey watch it
whats wrong with you
sven snorts with more conviction moos brays
avoiding i dont understand you when you talk like that
lee kristoff tries to walk on ahead but sven uses his antlers to lift kristoff off the ground
put me down
sven drops him hard then yells at him once more
were not going back
sven shakes his head angrily
shes with her true love
sven makes an of course she isnt face
kristoff gets it hes made his point
just then the wind picks up
kristoff looks back at the kingdom
sees a violent winter storm swirling over the castle
sharp ice claws its way up the castle encasing it
without hesitating he dashes back down the mountain
sven runs after him catches up
kristoff grabs svens harness and jumps onto his back
anna shivers by the door
she looks up to see ice overtaking the ceiling
the door handle suddenly jiggles
barely a whisper help
the door swings open
we see a carrot in the lock and hear a giggle of victory
olaf takes the carrot puts it back on his face
then he sees anna lying there
he runs to the fireplace
throws in some fresh wood including one of his own arms which he quickly rescues before striking a match and relighting the fire
get away from there
so this is heat
considering i love it
he reaches a twig finger toward the flames
it catches on fire
but dont touch it
he shakes the flame out as he rushes over to help anna to the fire
so wheres hans
what happened to your kiss
i was wrong about him
it wasnt true love
confused innocence huh
but we ran all the way here
please olaf you cant stay here youll melt
i am not leaving here until we find some other act of true love to save you
he sits down behind her stubbornly
leans his back against hers and thinks
do you happen to have any ideas
i dont even know what love is
confident thats okay i do
olaf hops back up and puts a soothing hand on her shoulder
lee love is
putting someone elses needs before yours like you know how kristoff brought you back here to hans and left you forever
kristoff loves me
wow you really dont know anything about love do you
his face starts to melt
olaf youre melting
sweet and reassuring some people are worth melting for
his face really melts
he panics pushes the snow back in place
just maybe not right this second
suddenly the window blows open cold wind sweeps in
dont worry ive got it
olaf flitters to the window
he pulls one panel of it shut but struggles with the second panel
determined were going to get through distracted oh wait
im getting something
he breaks an icicle off the window uses it as a telescope and sees
kristoff and sven running back down the mountain
its kristoff and sven
theyre coming back this way
they they are
lee wow hes really moving fast
i guess i was wrong
i guess kristoff doesnt love you enough to leave you behind
anna tries to get to her feet
help me up olaf
he hurries over tumbling over the couch knocking over the chess set and water jugs
no no no no no
you need to stay by the fire and keep warm
i need to get to kristoff
realizing oh oh oh i know why
he hops around in an excited display of hope
theres your act of true love right there riding across the fjords like a valiant pungent reindeer king
the walls crack under the ice pressure
they rush out the room just as the ceiling collapses
anna and olaf struggle down the hall
ice spikes grow and block their path
anna looks around desperately for a way out
lee elsa runs but is nearly blinded by the snow and wind
anna and olaf bust open a window
the storm is so strong it sweeps the window panes away
its a long snowy way down
but what choice do they have
they slide down the iced covered building
anna arrives at the bottom weak but uninjured
olaf gathers snow along the way
he arrives at the bottom as a giant snowball
we made it
he shakes off the extra snow as anna struggles to her feet
kristoff and sven bound off the mountain and sprint across the frozen fjord waters and right into the heart of the storm
its white out wind pushes them back
but they fight through
come on buddy faster
anna and olaf reach the shore of the fjords
the wind lifts olaf up and pulls him apart
he goes swirling off into the storm
keep going anna
anna struggles on
kristoff rides sven past cracking frozen ships
sven struggles over the uneven surface
suddenly a mangled ship risen by ice capsizes over them
they give it all theyve got as debris falls all around them and the mast shatters
they make it past just as the entire ship slams down and cracks the thick ice beneath their feet
the ice opens up
sven bravely jumps over a gap
but its too wide
he bucks kristoff to safety but lands in the freezing water and disappears below
at first theres nothing but the wind and the tumbling icy water
but suddenly sven surfaces and claws his way to a floating ice chunk
he calls out signalling for kristoff to go on
anna moves blindly across the fjord
annas hands frost over an icy blue
she stumbles on determined
but shes running out of time
she clutches her chest
the color in her eyes fades the inevitable is coming
kristoff lost in the white out doesnt know which way to turn
but then he hears a faint kristoff
lee elsa struggles through her own storm but the fear is consuming her
a dark shadow approaches
you cant run from this
elsa backs away from him
just take care of my sister
she returned from the mountain weak and cold
she said you froze her heart
i tried to save her but it was too late
her skin was ice
her hair turned white
elsas face sinks as she realizes what she has done
your sister is dead
because of you
elsa drops to her knees emotionally broken
and with that the swirling storm suddenly stops
the snow freezes mid air hangs suspended trapped in grief
citizens and dignitaries rush to the walls edge and look out to see
anna barely able to move but now able to see across the fjords to
a whisper kristoff
anna pushes on towards kristoff
he runs top speed towards her
theres still a lot of fjord to cross but kristoff is giving it all hes got
hes going to make it
but then anna hears the sound of a sword being drawn from its scabbard
she turns and sees hans behind elsa as he raises his sword over his head
anna looks back at kristoff as he runs for her
she gives him a longing look but then turns away from him and then
using all of her remaining strength as hans brings his sword down anna throws herself in front of elsa
in that instant anna freezes to solid ice
the sword hits her instead of elsa
the sword shatters completely
the force of it sends hans flying back and knocks him out
elsa rushes to anna and touches her sisters frozen face
no please no
olaf walks up and sees anna frozen
confused sad anna
elsa hugs anna and cries
kristoff watches in shocked despair
sven steps up to his side
citizens and dignitaries on the castle walls bow their heads
all of arendelle is joined in somber silence
but then anna warms
she begins to thaw
olaf looks up and gasps
kristoff and sven notice light up
anna bends her arm and embraces elsa
anna opens her eyes
she smiles at elsa relieved
lee you sacrificed yourself for me
weak i love you
olaf realizes whats happened
hes so excited about it he lifts his head right off his body and exclaims an act of true love will thaw a frozen heart
elsa looks at anna with confidence
elsa lifts her arms and the ground shakes and cracks
the ice and snow breaks away and rises high into the air
beneath their feet the bow of a ship thaws
the entire fjord melts and other boats right themselves
the villagers come out to see the warmth returning
in one final wave elsa draws all of the snow into a giant snowflake in the sky then waves it away leaving only a warm summer day
i knew you could do it
melting good naturedly hands down this is the best day of my life
and quite possibly the last
hang on little guy
lee elsa waves her hand and surrounds olaf with a swirl of cold air
above his head she leaves a little perpetually snowing storm cloud
olaf loves it
hey my own personal flurry
kristoff sees hans trying to get to his feet
he marches toward him prepared for a fight
but anna puts up a hand and stops him
shell handle this
she goes over to hans
but she froze your heart
the only frozen heart around here is yours
she turns away from him proud of her words
but not yet satisfied she turns back and punches him right in the face
whoa whoa whoa
he falls overboard
elsa comes over to anna and hugs her
over her shoulder kristoff meets annas eyes
she smiles brighter happy
its a beautiful summer day
the mighty ships have been repaired and are sailing away
on one of the ships hans is thrown into a brig
to kai i will return this scoundrel to his country
we shall see what his twelve big brothers think of his behavior
arendelle thanks you my lord
lee down on the dock arendelle guards lead the duke and his two thugs to their ship
this is unacceptable
i am innocent
im a victim of fear
ive been traumatized
bad acting ow
my neck hurts
is there a doctor i could
and i demand to see the queen
kai steps down from the gangplank to the dock
i have a message from the queen
reading a scroll arendelle will henceforth and forever no longer do business of any sort with weaseltown
the guards usher him and his thugs onto their ship
anna runs through the crowd pulling a blindfolded kristoff along behind her
shes so excited she cant stand it
she runs him right into a pole
anna skips to the perfect spot and stops
here we are
lee she takes off the blindfold
kristoff opens his eyes
before him sits the most beautiful suped up sled
sven poses in front of it vanna white style
i owe you a sled
blown away are you serious
and its the latest model
i cant accept this
you have to
shes named you the official arendelle ice master and deliverer
sven shows off the ice master and deliverer medal like hes king of the bucks
thats not a thing
but he cant help but admire her enthusiasm
sure it is
and it even has a cup holder
do you like it
he sweeps her up high overhead and spins her around
i love it
i could kiss you
he drops her suddenly embarrassed
i mean id like to
i mean may we
she gives him a quick kiss on the cheek
lee he smiles and goes for it
its a true loves kiss alright
we move past them to find olaf enjoying the summer
with his snow cloud safely overhead hes free to smell the flowers which he does
then sneezes his carrot nose off
sven catches it between his teeth
olaf gasps as sven sucks the whole carrot into his mouth
olafs face sinks in sadness
but not to fear sven spits the carrot back out and jams it into olafs face where it belongs
its completely covered in reindeer spit but olaf doesnt seem to mind
he hugs sven happily
the gates to the castle are wide open
in the courtyard stands elsa
are you ready
elsa stops and creates an ice rink
the people skates at the ready hope onto it and twirl about
elsa then freezes the fountain in a beautiful design and adds some snow flurries for atmosphere
anna comes slipping in
elsa catches her
i like the open gates
we are never closing them again
elsa then waves her hand and magical ice skates literally made of ice form on annas boots
oh elsa theyre beautiful but you know i dont ska elsa grabs annas hands and pulls her along on the ice
anna slips and slides but laughs in delight
sven goes slipping past
kristoff runs after him
reindeer coming through
lee olaf skates and helps elsa coach anna
glide and pivot and glide and pivot
we pull away slowly into the sky
we arrive at a birds eye view to see that where the castle had crumbled has been repaired with a ice
all is right in arendelle
