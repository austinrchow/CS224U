by emily fox revisions by mark steilen february close on the anxious sweating frightened face of drew macleod running to save her life
think dustin hoffman in marathon man someone something is after her but unseen
she glances fearfully behind at her mysterious pursuer her breathing becoming more labored
cutting through a deserted park she leaps a bench
above her the thin morning sun has only begun to lighten the leaves
around the corner shes back on a sidewalk lined with beautiful homes all quiet at dawn the only noise her racing footsteps and quickening breaths
and safety loom half a block down
she pours on the effort hurdles a hedge jumps the stairs and makes the door rips it open bolts inside and slams it shut
where with the camera at ground level a golden retriever puppy unable to leap the hedge plows into it headfirst and disappears
macleod house foyer continuous action drew wheezing from the exertion pulls an asthma inhaler from her pocket takes a hit then peeks out the window in the front door and
the puppy squeezes through the hedge wiggling its bum to extricate itself
a six year old girl picks it up hugs it close where are you going jelly bean
macleod house parkers room morning close on a japanese executive with a clock in his belly which suddenly begins screaming in japanese its jaw from under piles of clothes and
sheets parker macleod drews twin sister opens one eye shuts off the shrieking alarm clock
with a sigh she throws her feet over the edge of the bed
her room is a train wreck
grabbing a matchbox t shirt from the pile on the bed she gives it a sniff
pulling it on she pauses looks a bit concerned down at her navel
a recent belly button piercing looks a little red
she touches it
when a ringing is heard she begins tossing clothes blankets shoes trying to unearth the source
she pulls her blackberry from under the covers parker snickers types her return from
this makes her smile
macleod house bathroom morning drew stands before the mirror perfecting perfection
in a tasteful suit hair just so she opens the drawer
which is hyper organized everything in a little labeled nook
she pulls out tweezers and we see beneath where it says tweezers
she leans into the mirror very close spots a stray eyebrow hair plucks it
pulling back she raises her other eyebrow
now theyre not even
she leans in again and plucks one from the other eyebrow
this is like when your mom cuts your hair and keeps cutting to get it even until youre shaved
she reaches for the other side
but suddenly catches herself and stops
lets not get too psychotic
she dunks the tweezers in the alcohol jar then replaces them
checking her teeth she spots a stuck bit
grabbing her water pick she begins cleaning her teeth
startled drew shoots herself in the eye with the water pick
parkers entered from her side
drew shuts off the water pick dries her face
why the young executive look
i have my interview at nyu today
parker sleepy stretches unaware shes exposing her new belly ring
no way mom knows about that
self consciously parker drops her arms pulls her shirt down
and she never will
at least until after im married
didnt it hurt
piercings are so
a little beep beep from her preset watch alarm goes off
drew turns on her heel and exits
when parker sets her blackberry down we get our first glimpse of
her side of the bathroom which resembles a post apocalyptic toiletry landscape
theres a very clear line of demarcation on the counter like the demilitarized zone separating the koreas
parker reaches among the rubble for her toothbrush but notices another message on her blackberry accompanying the text a picture warren has sent finishes downloading eighteenish the shaggy chic calvin
klein model type
suddenly wide awake hellooo warren
distracted parker drops her toothbrush which bounces off the counter and plops into the toilet
on the toilet bowl there it is slowly sinking
parker is stone faced
she looks to her sisters side of the counter where a fresh brush sits in the flowered holder
instead she squeezes the tube straight into her mouth brushes with a finger and spits
macleod house kitchen morning drews seated napkin on lap eating granola and studying her open daybook
quinn macleod dressed professionally and obviously together even at this hour pours coffee for herself and her husband professor charley macleod who enters still in his ratty old bathrobe and
outrageous bed head
as a matter of routine quinn holds out his cup and he takes it kisses her and sits down to the paper
hows the book coming
sigh well sweety my writing process is a lot like a giant hydroelectric dam
for a long time i just let the great ideas build up and build up until the sheer weight of them spills over and the words just come pouring out
still stuck huh
not a word
parker enters with her blackberry in hand smooches her pop then takes a sat
parkers clearly a chip off her dads block
both pour milk first into their bowl then charley drops in super sugar crisp while parker pours in count chocula
both hit em with a couple of spoons of extra sugar
mom takes a seat too primly eating a piece of dry wheat toast that she slices in half first
like mom like drew
drew spots the blackberry jpeg of warren before parker can turn it over
another one for the trophy room huh
boys can be fun
you should try one some time
to drew you ready for your interview
funny you should ask ive prepared a color coded itinerary based on dividing the day into fifteen minute increments alternating blue red double checked the train schedule confirmed with the
weather channel and rehearsed a couple of alternate scenarios last night you know just to account for all the possible glitches
well take that as a yes
im proud of you for sticking to your plan all these years sweety
i still dont understand why you want to finish college in two years
whats the big hurry
i want to hit the ground running
all those football games and the partying and the whole dating scene
it just seems like a lot of wasted time that could be spent more productively
the accelerated program would look great on your med school application
football games i get
a waste of time
parker looks to her dad
to each her own
i have a surprise
everybody stops what theyre doing for a beat
i took the day off
excitedly im going into the city with you
drew chokes on her granola and a little milk trickles out her nose
isnt that great

wont that be fun
if you want to have fun im the one who should go not mother teresa over there
drew is still choking pretty badly
let me know if you want me to do the heimlich
itd be cool to have you owe me your life
the granola goes down and she sucks air
still clearing no
i mean its
ive got every minute accounted for right up to the interview
blue and red
it wont work
i just thought
ive been working and we havent had a chance to spend much time together
quinn the normally thick skinned m
is tearing up
and both my babies are going away to college next fall
she takes her plate and goes to the sink and parker follows her putting an arm around her shoulder
dont be sad mom
just think when drew leaves for school you wont be losing a daughter youll be losing an anal retentive social misfit who will be voted most likely to die a
drew throws an arm around quinns other shoulder
im sorry mom
its really sweet of you
but dont worry
parker will be living here with you forever since no college on earth will ever take her
stop it you two
mom blows her nose
its not fair you guys get to go into the city and i dont
dont you have a chem test young lady
name one time you ever used chemistry in your life
beat good point
adamant i use chemistry every day
youre a doctor mom
im not going to be a doctor
i cant even say the word orifice let alone put a finger up one
the beep beep of drews alarm watch signals time to go
drew is trying to cover up but shes reeling from the news that her mothers going to accompany her
worried time to go
drews room looks like a four star hotel suite
almost trembling with tension she enters and immediately sits down at her desk with her dayplanner turning to the present date come on honey
lets tear up manhattan
with a shiver drew closes the book looks up into the mirror takes a squirt off her inhaler to calm herself and tries some self reassurance
youll find a way to make it work
she tries to sell herself on this by smiling but something in the smile suggests shes screwed
collecting her dayplanner purse interview file and cell phone she drops them into her matching coach shoulder bag
driveway macleod house morning quinn hops in her saab
angle on the doorway where drew pauses takes a deep breath to brace herself then walks like a condemned prisoner to her mothers car and climbs in
quinns cell phone goes off
quinn looks annoyed checks the incoming number
drew closes her eyes and prays
to phone doctor macleod
beat winking at drew im sorry but my itinerary is booked solid today
hes covering for me
beat he did
beat are you sure its the babys head
beat all right
frustrated mom hangs up and with a look of profound disappointment turns to drew
im sorry hon
its a blue light special in maternity
every beds full and some poor woman is about to give birth in the gift shop
i have to go in
drew musters her best sad sad face for her mom
ah darn it mom
thats a shame
its like fate is conspiring against us
you absolutely positively have to promise me well do it another time
i better hurry
have parker drop you at the train station on her way to school will you
quinn gives her daughter a smile and a kiss
kill em in that interview
beat mom you know i might not get in
are you kidding me
youre drew macleod
nobodys smarter nobody works harder and nobody and i mean nobody is ever more prepared
drew smiles hugs her mom and jumps out waving as her mom backs down the drive and disappears down the street
with the weight of the world suddenly lifted from her shoulders drew looks to the sky and mouths thank you
this is when parker comes hauling down the driveway in her honda accord
drew signals her to stop so of course her sister ignores her and jets into the street
drew takes off running after the car
commuters all jump from their cars and into the station
parker pulls up to the curb at the station
drew collects her bag
good luck with your interview
drew pauses holding the door open
you know parker
chemistry is important
when you think about it everythings made of chemicals
oh im interested in chemistry
just not the kind with all the numbers and stinky test tubes
drew shuts the door and hustles off into the train station
parker sighs looks to the blackberry on the seat next to her
drew finds a seat
she neatly folds her jacket and sets it next to her
she pulls out a lumbar support pillow and tucks it behind her just right
next she takes out a tiny inflatable lap desk blows it up and sets it across her lap
a pen goes in the little holder
coffee from her thermos
after laying out her interview materials she turns to her reflection in the window
low rehearsing professor spaulding
im drew macleod
an executive takes the aisle seat next to her and after a sideways glance at drews portable office opens his wall street journal as the train begins to pull away
every commuter is quietly reading the paper or staring off into their own world wondering why their life has lead them to this sad moment when
theyre all distracted by an awful awful voice singing sheryl crows soak up the sun
its parker wearing her headphones and looking for a seat in the full train car
drew stares at her dumbfounded
what do you think youre doing
too loud with headphones on looking for a seat
this cant be happening
wait i know
this is one of those ground hog day dreams isnt it
drew pinches herself too hard
to parker im awake now
youre supposed to disappear
still too loud you know i just got this itch
then scratch it and get back to school
i couldnt concentrate anyway
youre permanently distracted
its called attention deficit disorder
spotting her blackberry is this about that chat room guy
it is isnt it
a look from the exec reminds parker of her headphones and she pulls them off
its about spontaneity which you obviously wouldnt know anything about
i swear to god parker you go through boyfriends like junior mints
you want to talk about pathetic
at least i dont count getting accidentally felt up in dodge ball as my first date
youre going to be eighteen and youve never even had a boyfriend
the executive furrows his brow at drew never
is this any of your business
he goes back to his paper
this is ridiculous
i dont have time for this today
dont graduate from high school
make a mess of your life over some complete stranger
i dont care
but leave me out
i have something important i need to accomplish today so please go away
to parker would you like this seat so you two can fight
no thank you
drews alarm watch beeps
i have to mentally preview my day now
i cant talk anymore
parker turns to go then remembers something
do you have any money
i dont have enough for a ticket
drew just rolls her eyes and turns her back on her sister
the executive peers over his spectacles at parker with the old paternal reprimand look
like you never ditched school
parkers got her headphones back on and is singing uncle crackers follow me torturing everyone in her car
you dont know how you met me
but when she spots the conductor entering the front of the car she abruptly stops slips down in he seat and slides past the commuter lady next to her into
parker heads the opposite direction from the ticket taking conductor and out the back of the train car
parker stands by the door waiting listening to hear if the coast is clear
she cracks the door steps out on tiptoes closes the door and theres the conductor
why dont i save the b
story and just ask you to cut me a break this one time because i know youve got a big heart and you remember what it was like when you
were young and
off the conductors look randy
parkers on the platform
the conductor climbs back on the train into the first car
calling after i guess you were never young and randy
this is when she sees drew sitting in the train window smiling and giving her a little victory wave
the conductor heads up the aisle does a double take when he sees drew
he takes her by the arm
what are you doing
drew scrambles to grab her bag jacket the little inflatable lap desk falling to the floor
i tried to be nice about it but if you want the police involved this is the way to do it
i didnt do anything
no ticket no train ride
thats not me
that was my twin sister you threw off
young lady in thirty years i have heard every possible line but thats the lamest ever
pointing shes right there
he hauls drew down the aisle but as they exit the car climber male model guy they really do crack foreheads
both of them shake off the woozies
he smiles you okay
shes fine considering she should be in jail
as the conductor escorts her down the stairs she and dream guy share a last look before shes
left on the platform just as the trains pulling out
still no sign of parker and drew doesnt have all her wits about her
this cant be happening
i have a
little paper thingy
what are they called
i have a ticket
she drops her bag contents spilling willy nilly
on her hands and knees she frantically searches for her ticket in the mess
the conductor however is already on the train stop as it pulls away
he just waves victorious
parker steps back out onto the platform and the conductor spots her
he looks from one sister to the other oops mistake
but its too late
sheepishly he climbs inside and the train is gone
to the gods parker steps up from behind her
you get kicked off too
why didnt you just buy a ticket
parker stoops to help collect a couple of things but drew mad at hell swats her hand away
what happened to your head
oh just a minor concussion i sustained while the conductor was throwing me off the train because he thought i was you sneaking back on the train
drew throws her bag over her shoulder and heads for the ticket counter
the welt on her forehead is gonna be a doozey
calling after i am
where are you going
to see when the next train leaves
i already but drews inside the stationhouse
they said something about a delay
parker follows into the stationhouse
packed with frustrated commuters
drews standing in a long line at the ticket counter steaming turning a cold shoulder on
parker who walks right through to the street side
parker steps outside where its just as crowded
she scopes the situation which isnt good stranded commuters jostle for the few remaining taxis
two executives get into a shoving match
to the left a couple of black lincoln town cars standard car service rigs sit idling each with a driver next to it holding up his sign with his clients
name scratched on it
an executive passes her finger in the air signaling the first driver who holds a sign that read wilcox
with no further ado the driver opens the back door for him the exec climbs in the driver hustles around to his side and in an instant the car leaves
the chaos behind
parker raises an eyebrow
the second driver bennie with a head like a cinder block and no neck is talking on his cell phone and holding up a sign scarpelli
parker shoots a finger into the air
this barely gets his attention but he nods nonchalantly
parker signals again one minute then turns back inside
drew has reached the counter where a bitter train clerk who wishes hed paid attention in school is tired of angry commuters
that cant be
i have to be there before two
well maybe if you flap your arms real fast you can fly there because you wont get there on a train
about to explode what did you just say
parker arrives in the nick of time pulling her by the arm
i got us a ride
let go of my arm
but parker drags her away
drew shoots a look back at the clerk who sticks out his tongue at her
parker pulls drew toward the town car
a car service
you couldnt have called for a
but bennie opens the door for parker like hes done it a thousand times
my sisters coming too
drew knows some sketchy shit is going down buy shes only got this instant to consider
she glances at the stranded mob descending on a lone approaching cab engulfing it
you want to make that interview or not
drew lets herself be pulled inside
bennie shuts the door and waddles around to his side
parker tries to play cool drews rigid angry and afraid
bennie checks his invoice
so youre headed to the teamsters hall on second street
chewing a lip you know mister
she checks his chauffeurs license up front benjamin loyola
we have a slight change of itinerary
we need to go into manhattan
th and th will be fine
bennie doesnt seem perturbed a bit
its pre paid
no skin off my nose
whispering throughout pre paid
whats th and th
whispering throughout barneys
weve got five hours
he fires up the lincoln and off they go
drew now has a pretty clear inclination as to whats going on
she leans into her sister and whispers
this was supposed to be someone elses car wasnt it
just then bennie tosses the sign which hed stashed on the dash onto the seat next to him face up so drew can read scarpelli
were supposed to be italian
this is so
you need to get to that interview
we now have a ride
we will pay for the ride
end of big deal
this is when bennies cell phone rings and he answers it
beat whata you talkin about
bennie glances into the rearview mirror smiling at the girls
i already got em
but his smile turns down at the corners as he listens
the girls exchange doubtful looks
it gets worse
theyre right here in the car
to girls scuse me
bennie raises the privacy glass but doesnt realize hes left the intercom button on so they can still hear his half of the conversation
the girls are petrified
low to drew not good
swallowing whats happening
to phone dont you think thats a little severe
i mean they didnt see nothin yet
they cant hear nothin
yes they can and theyre now scared as hell
youre the boss
beat take it easy
ill fix it
beat no i dont have a shovel
itll be a big mess
besides i just had this suit cleaned
the girls want out of this car
ill take em to the wharf what difference does it make
drew yanks out her inhaler and sucks on it
whispered terror parker i think maybe we should get out
parker sees the light ahead turn red
just as bennie brakes for the light parker throws her door open and pulls drew into the street
an oncoming buick locks up its brakes as they dash for the sidewalk
where you goin
they hit the sidewalk and without breaking stride race around the first corner looking back over their shoulder
hes stuck at the light
here comes the lincoln storming around the corner
he has no respect for traffic laws
they run into the first alley and hunker down by a garbage can
the lincoln flies past
they dash back out the same way they came
bennie locks up the wheels
they round the same corner going the opposite way and parker pulls them into the first door
where they crouch down the magazine rack
among the magazines is dog fancy with a picture of a chinese crested hairless on the cover and the headline emperor parker peers over the top and out the window
parkers pov slowly the lincoln cruises the street bennie scanning the neighborhood for them
is he gone
i cant believe this
what did you get us into
we lost him
that was a rush
are you out of your mind
give me a quarter will ya
spooked they both turn to find a scraggly homeless guy with a slushee in his hand
parker reaches in her pocket
get outta here uncle jerry
to homeless guy i dont have any change but here
parker starts to find the homeless guy a dollar but drew reaches over to stop her
parker youre only feeding the poor mans disease
buy him a healthy snack
just as the homeless guy reaches for the dollar and the slushee is knocked from his hand
we watch in slow motion as the slushee takes flight the the homeless guy snags the dollar
i gotta go
and he exits
thats not just slushee
the mini mart clerk approaches them shaking his head
its mad dog
look at that mess
its gonna smell up the store all day
drew appears stunned unable to form words so parker speaks for her
may we use your bathroom please
the cherry syrup and cheap wine concoction drips down drews blank face
gas station at the end of the block
have a nice day
burt who has no teeth hands over the restroom key to the girls
the key is attached to a full sized steering wheel
burt sniffs wrinkling his nose
you know its not my place to say but you young girls got your whole lives ahead of you
you shouldnt be drinkin at this hour of the day
thats what i keep telling her
round the side
the girls practically have to drag the key around to the restroom on the side
parker puts the key in and slowly
opens the gates of hell sitting side by side
a young mother sits in front of them with her nine month old baby whos standing on the seat facing the girls
drews bump on her forehead is large and inflamed her hair a stringy ratty mess of booze and red dye number four and glucose
she is in a really bad mood only staring straight ahead
parkers playing peek a boo with the baby and trying to lighten up her sisters mood
everythings going to be fine
to baby peek a boo
to drew were practically there
well get you cleaned up youll get into the program and
to baby peek a boo
to drew well both look back on this and laugh our butts off
the baby pukes all over drew
she looks sideways at her sister
i will never ever forgive you
the bus pulls over then pulls away leaving the girls on the sidewalk
we made it
i could be arrested for vagrancy looking like this
ive got an idea
im going straight to that interview and wait without moving or speaking especially to you for four hours
ignoring her come on
were going to the plaza
we can be eloise
well get a nice room you can take a shower and ill swap clothes with you
simple as that
do you have the slightest clue what that would cost
youve got the emergency credit card mom gave you right
drews suddenly looking at her empty hands
dawning realization oh
wheres your uh stuff
near coma i left it in his car
he knows where i live
hes going to hunt me down and kill me
come on drew
i dont think even the mafia kills people just for scamming a ride
quit being paranoid
beat so we dont do the plaza
parker digs in her pockets
six dollars and thirty two cents
that wont get me hosed down at a car wash
what are we thinking
youve got your secret safety twenty
beat my secret safety twenty
but its only for emergencies
parker looks her sister right in the eye
drew takes off her shoe lifts the inner sole and pulls out a twenty then realizes hey howd you know about my secret safety twenty
thats not important now
but lets just say that its a good thing for you i think those shoes are so ugly i never borrowed them
pointing hey how about there
parker points to hotel where the dilapidated sign reads no
i want to get clean not contract hepatitis
sotto voce twenty six dollars and thirty six cents
we touch nothing
parker leads them inside
this looks like a good place to get your throat cut fighting over a dimes worth of crack
theres no real lobby just a small area to stand at the desk which is behind iron bars
behind the iron bars a rabbit eared tv with a busted in tube houses a dead houseplant
an old easy chair leaks stuffing
above a baby screeches
then a disembodied voice speaks to them
keep your pants on
the girls look behind them nobody
behind the bars
what the hell
i dont got all day
we need a room
with a shower
just for an hour
theres the sound of something scraping across the floor and then the midget hotel clerk appears behind the counter
now hes standing on a stool and we dont know what he was doing behind the counter
getting oriented hi
you want the room or not
sixty dollars an hour for this interrupting covering really nice place
how much for half an hour
maybe if you two were in school you could figure out that half a sixty is thirty
weve only got twenty five
you think because im short you can just charm me into making some deal is that it
no not at all
its all we have
twenty six dollars and thirty six cents
are you the one that stinks so bad
insulted i had a little accident okay
all right all right dont get your underwear in a bunch
as a public service just cause you stink so bad you can have it for twenty five
he retrieves a key and holds it up just out of reach between the bars
ten dollar deposit on key
what part of that is all the money we have didnt make sense to you
sir thats every last cent we have in the world
i swear to you we arent planning to steal your key
i give you some special deal the next thing you know you two are telling everybody hey this midget was a real sap
we gave him some sob story and the little guy just busted up into crocodile tears and handed over the key
i promise we wont tell anyone
will we drew
not a word
girl scouts honor
he grudgingly holds out the key for parker who takes it and hands it to drew while she gets the money out
on drew sensing something she looks down at her feet where a huge rat is licking the sweet stuff off her shoes
theres a rather long beat while this horror sinks in then key in hand drew makes a beeline out the door
parker follows her
come back with my key
the desk clerk jumps off his stool opens his cage and follows them into the street
panicked drew sprints down the sidewalk with parker and the desk clerk in tow
laying the hammer down the desk clerk blasts past parker hes a midget but hes got wheels
a woman is giving birth
her husband holds her hand
quinn and a nurse are at her feet
youre going to have to help
i need you to push
but they dont have her attention which is riveted on
did you see that
today show security guards and nypd descend on the crowd
whos the wise guy
parker pulls drew out of the pile up and grabs the key tossing it away from them sending the desk clerk scrambling after it
the two girls high tail it around the corner
winded they stop
man that little guy could really motor
whyd you bolt
there was a rat parker
a rat the size of a doberman eating my foot
that was all our money
key down youre going to have an attack
drews sucking on her inhaler but is so irate she spits out the words
parker it was not our money and this is not our day in new york
what it is is quite possibly the most important day of my life
ive resigned myself to the fact that you dont give a crap about what you do with yours but if you could find it in your heart your tiny cold
steel heart to respect what this means to me i would appreciate it
but parkers not listening
shes staring intently
across the street where several town cars are parked the drivers chatting next to a hot dog pretzel cart
among them is bennie sipping coffee
parker spots him and freezes
youre not even listening
look were splitting up
give me back my secret safety money
still looking past drew you know how i told you not to be paranoid
what i meant was it isnt paranoia if someone really is chasing you
parker tries to subtly indicate with her eyes that drew should look across the street
whats wrong with your eyes
whispering its him
drew finally turns and she too freezes
hell see us
not wanting to draw his attention the girls shuffle off quickly down the street
on bennie squinting across at them
can he make them out in the crowd
he nods to another driver tosses his coffee cup and climbs in behind the wheel
the girls break into a run
howd he find us
maybe its just coincidence
or maybe we told him where we were she points up at the street sign th and th
parker leads her into traffic horns blaring as they weave their way across
on the far side a horse carriage pulls away from the curb and at the last minute parker spots a fresh pile of
horse shit which she manages to leap
drew however isnt going to make it over
she closes her eyes
drew stumbles wrong foots the takeoff but somehow manages to get across it to the curb
for just a beat we see her surprised face
i did it
then they see bennie crossing in traffic huffing and puffing after them and not seeing the pile which he hits in full stride slips on and plops into on his
this gives the girls the opening they need and they ditch inside some revolving doors
in the street bennies getting up brushing the crap off
when a cab honks at him he gives it an italian salute and slaps the hood but when he reaches the curb its clear hes lost the girls
i dont want to do this anymore
i want to be done
no more rats no more mob hit men
well cinderella your wish has come true
gesturing voila la plaza mademoiselle
ive got what id like to call a creative solution to that
im calling mom
what good will that do
beat ill have her
have her what
could you leave that baby halfway outta there and drive into the city
couldnt get to an interview by myself need full bail out
im the one who was going to change the world i just couldnt get across town
damn it parker my itinerary is shot to hell
blue red her watch alarm beeps
i dont even know what that means
im running out of time
noticing is that guy looking at me
parker starts to look
when you ask a question like that the person is going to look
drew drags her behind a palm
sure enough across the lobby a guy dressed as plainclothes hotel security morty sestero now pretends he wasnt keeping an eye on them
i think he was
drew we havent done anything
yeah but im standing in the lobby of the plaza looking like a deranged street person who might attack at any moment
in fact i might attack at any moment
the elevator behind them opens
the girls slip into the elevator
when it closes mortys watching
the girls climb out of the elevator and sneak to the end of the hall where parker stops and peers back around the corner
whispering what are we doing
and why am i whispering
were getting you a shower
blake greer pulled this at the sheraton after the prom
now were emulating blake greer voted most likely to commit a felony before having to shave
were not going to steal anything
were just going to sneak in use a little soap and water and get out
oh were not going to steal anything
just a little breaking and entering
were not going to break anything
beat we are going to enter however
here comes somebody
down the hall a door swings open and mr
lo biancho wealthy bostonians exit their suite
reveals at the opposite end of the hallway parker and drew arent the only ones watching
a painter with one lazy eye roger pauses with his roller and carefully peeks around the corner
its the new york kennel club emile not the new york knickerbockers
please call the caterer and cancel the beer
the elevator opens for them and they step in
parker runs like hell for the door of their suite
its just about to close when she slides like pete rose into first just getting a hand on it
she lies there on the floor holding the door and whispers loudly to drew
beat i didnt want to have to do this but
look in the mirror behind you
on drew bracing herself she turns slowly
practically sewn to parker drew follows her into the suite both nervous tiptoeing
at the end of the hallway the painter watches the suite door close
what are those girls doing
its lavish yaddada yaddada
i cant do this
drew youre not a criminal
you just smell like one
parker leads her to the big double doors of the master bedroom and slowly opens them
there on the bed is the emperor defending champion of the new york kennel club dog show
a chinese crested hairless with his little crown sticking straight up he may be the most absurd looking dog in history
he simply eyes them
he might even be smiling
oh my god
puzzled what the hell is it
im itching already
are my arms red
drew backs away shes about to break for the door
ill take him in the living room and keep a lookout
you just get in that shower
parker approaches the emperor
baby talk hi little guy
you dont look so tough huh
you dont look much like a dog actually
more like woody woodpecker
happy to give the company the emperor practically jumps into parkers arms
youre cute arent you in a freakazoidal kinda way
she takes him into the living room and moves to the door
was your daddy a rat
is that it
well i still like you
parker holding the emperor opens the door a crack to keep a lookout
the hallways empty
but the emperor feeling frisky leaps from her arms into the hallway then turns to face her
come back here little ratdog
come to mommy parker
parker pulls off a shoe and sticks it in the doorway to keep it from closing then hesitantly trying not to spook him into running away from her she steps
into the hallway
but sure enough just as she gets close he turns and dashes down the hallway
she chases him down the hallway and then around the corner where they have to dodge cans of paints a ladder until finally the emperor slides on some plastic sheeting
careens into a can of mauve paint and is arms reach down pick him up and parker looks up to see the painter roger with the now mauve emperor in his arms
he turns and runs for the stairwell door marked exit
parker completely baffled finally calls after him thats not your dog
as they open and the house security guy morty steps out looking both ways and spotting one thing awry
a shoe holding open the door to the lo bianchos suite
drew finishes struggling out of the last of her sticky clothes and gets one foot in the shower when she hears hello
panicking she grabs the shower curtain pulling it off its hanger and covering herself
the security guy snoops toward the bedroom doors
just as he reaches for the handle the door swings open shadock clocking him and dropping him
wrapped in the shower curtain drew races across the living room
just as she reaches the hallway parkers there also at a dead run and they dont even break stride
panicked theres a man in there
somebody took the dog
they reach the end of the hallway and are trapped
only one out
parker huffs open the window to the fire escape and they climb out
and scurry down the stairs only to find that the
parker hangs and then drops onto the top of a dumpster with one side of the lid still closed then jumps to the alley
but drews frozen with fear and to complicate matters shes struggling to keep the curtain wrapped around herself
ill uh go around
are you out of your mind
its only a little ways
rubbing his sore head morty the security guy lumbers down the hallway
behind him mr
lo biancho get out of the elevator peeved when competing in a dog show best to bring ones dog along yes
i thought you had him dear
holding up her hands see
but now they both notice the door to their suite is wide open
oh dear god
the elderly couple do their version of a panicked run inside
on morty making an abrupt halt
he turns around and lopes back to the suite
im mort sestero hotel security
someone took your baby
the emperor is missing
somewhat relieved the emperor is a dog right
not a dog no
the new york morty pulls his radio as he backs out the door and heads down the hall
to radio this is remote one to base remote one to base
code i repeat code
you goin to lunch already morty
impatient code isnt lunch bruce
didnt you read your manual
beat i will
we have a dognapping
just call the damn police and patch me through
the emperors been kidnapped
holy cripes why didnt you say it was political
the emperor is a dog you want me to call nypd about a dog
decrying his fate i am going to kill you then fire you bruce
drews still frozen on the fire escape
i cant do it
yes you can
where roger appears with the emperor
surprised to see the girls he backpedals worried hell be seen but theyre too wrapped up in their own getaway and he quietly makes his way to his van painted
on the back and sides michelangelos painting a masterpiece every time
no i cant
have fun in prison
under summer internships on your college application you can write license plate manufacturing
rogers van squeals away drawing parkers attention
she glimpses him in his side mirror as he disappears around the corner into traffic
shutting her eyes drew drops onto the closed lid of the dumpster
astonished i did it
oops the curtain starts to slip
when she reaches for it she loses her balance and suddenly fwonk nosedives into the dumpster
the curtain floats into the alley at parkers feet
get out of there
beat give me
parker tosses the curtain in and drew climbs out
they hurry off down the alley
in the second story fire escape window morty appears
bring back that dog
mortys pov the girls near the end of the alley
a small dog could easily be concealed under that shower curtain
on the girls running full tilt drew turns to parker
he thinks we have the dog
a painter took it
a pain wham
drews clotheslined at the intersection by a bike messenger who in a valiant attempt to avoid her brakes so hard he flies off the handlebars and lands
its dream guy from the train and for a confused beat they look into each others familiar faces where we read recognition love unstated chemistry then you know one of
us is gonna get hurt if we keep doing this
sirens signal that the police are now involved
hey complete stranger
get off my sister
parker yanks drew from underneath dream guy
im uh late for this place thing where im supposed to be
but parkers got her by the arm and she can only call back over her shoulder
before disappearing into the crowd on the sidewalk
too late me too
around the corner comes morty who without time to react trips headfirst over bike messenger guy
the girls weave through the pedestrians but spot a cop car screeching to a halt in front of them and quickly take a left into
where to now
thinking fast parker pulls on a door locked the next door swings open as if by divine providence and two high fashion models step past them out while the girls
models dressers sycophants i only date models guys and the famous couture fashion designer bobo are mid show and friggin frantic
french accent where are they
no more breaks
do you hear me
we have a show to do you nitwits
you have hollow gourds for heads
the kind they make those mexican rattles out of
always at his elbow maracas
maracas that take coffee breaks when i am paying them a bobo spots the girls coming through the back door and physically grabs them both pushing them at the showrunner
this is when he gets a load of drews matted hair running makeup and shower curtain and does a double take
does he like it
confess is that helmut lang
recovering himself go
the showrunner shoves drew one way parker the other drew looks at her what the hell
parker clearly mouths hair
and teams of dressers virtually surround them
inside the mob of dressers surrounding drew the hair stylist raises his brush and scissors but pauses
the rest of the team stops watching him make his decision
he excuses himself and the others begin shoving her into couture
and the dressing team surrounding parker parts revealing her in a very un parker like super chic business suit
she catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror and rolls her eyes
the drew team parts and we are stunned to see theyve chosen to drape her in a show stopping couture freak show outfit that is some sort of marriage between
dominatrix and nun complete with a habit and black leather bikini
on parker who spots drew and is for the first time in the movie speechless
why does this not surprise me
the next music cue comes up and the showrunner grabs drew
excuse me but im supposed to be going to my college interview
a model going to college
and pushes her through the curtains and
flash go a hundred cameras
blinded drew stumbles forward on a nine inch spiked heels down the catwalk
this is when drew catches sight of herself on a tv monitor at the end of the walk
her first instinct is to run but suddenly the audience drew recovers herself a bit
theyre clapping for me
parkers watching through the curtains when she spots morty leading two nypd detectives williamson and hogan through the back door
the showrunners holding her arm waiting to throw her onstage but when morty turns in her direction parker takes the initiative and
jumps onstage vamping it down the catwalk like she was born to it
drews still at the end of the runway basking in the applause and attempting to negotiate a precarious turn in her scary spiked heels when parker approaches her and
throws a hand on her hip thrusts it out sexy executive
and leans into her sister whispering the hotel guys here
the juxtaposition of the two polar opposite outfits draped over twins suddenly throws the audience into paroxysms of appreciation for the inspiration of the artist and they call him out
here comes a smiling bobo through the curtains blowing kisses and heading for the girls
louder and the police
bobo presses himself between the girls taking their hands and beginning his bows but the girls spot morty peeking from backstage and they take off leaping off the front of
the stage into the audience like punks jumping into the mosh pit
the adoring crowd holds them up and they crowd surf toward the rear of the room
everybody washed their hands right
spotting the commotion he and the two cops race down the catwalk
realizing hell never get through the crowd he too leaps off the stage to surf toward them but
the crowd abruptly parts and he does a complete face i guess that explains why hes a security guard
who bust out the back doors of the large room and unwittingly
right back into the plaza lobby
is this what they call returning to the scene of the crime
unfortunately for them to get to the front door they have to pass by
the plaza manager and the other house security agent bruce butch haircut bad suit consoling mrs
when morty and the cops come through the doors behind them however theres no choice
the girls try to look as inconspicuous as possible heading for the revolving doors but they overhear
i assure you mr
lo biancho the plaza will do everything in its power to see that the emperor is safely returned and that the criminals are brought to justice
i want them executed
tortured first slowly and then beheaded
the plazas policy is of course to serve you in any capacity we can
morty spots the girls across the lobby just as they reach the revolving doors
at the wagon wheel
bruce looks over to morty like hes speaking slavic but mortys furiously pointing and bruce sees
the girls break for the revolving doors
parker gets there first plunges in so fast that a man entering is tossed headlong into the lobby
drew tries to time the quickly spinning door but one of the very high spiked heels catches throwing her forward and sandwiching her in the revolving door
no breath park
outside parker sees drew caught in the door as bruce morty and the cops close in
quickly parker pushes the door back releasing drew who jumps in and swings out
then parker heaves the door with all her might spinning it so fast the security guys and cops cant jump in
the four men all stand there watching the spinning door
then just to their right an elderly woman walks through the regular door just adjacent the revolving doors
all four share a sheepish look uh maybe we should have thought of that then bolt outside
the police and security look left right across the street
whered they go
they couldnt have gone very far
well split up
pointing you go that way
you take fifth
come on get on your horse
morty and bruce take the cops order and race off in separate directions
neither hogan nor his partner moves
williamson and hogan step over to a hot dog cart set up next to a newspaper stand
to hot dog vendor two black
where do you think those two went
they didnt have any stupid dog with them from what i could see
might have stashed it
maybe they ate it
the cops giggle at this
the rent a cop said the mutts worth like gs
that makes it grand theft my friend
five to ten
where a blind cashier speedy smiles at the two policemen
to blind cashier hey speedy
you didnt see a couple of blondes run past here did you
couldnt miss em
real criminal types
looked like they were headed to mexico
thats where they all go
reveals drew and parker crouched down behind the counter right next to speedy
see you around
not if i see you first
the cops head back to the plaza
i say we put abbott and costello on the ransom watch
i dont want to be stuck in the same room all day with leona helmsleys nasty stepsister
with the detectives gone speedy turns up his nose and waves the air fanning away a bad smell
you know its not some old wives tale about blind people having an acute sense of smell
what did you do with that dog
we didnt steal it i swear
a painter did
you girls best give yourselves up and tell em the story
torn hes right parker
of course hes right
were going to march in there and give ourselves up right this minute
they will of course take us down to the precinct call mom and dad well give our statement theyll grill us under hot lights for a few hours force us
to confess with some tricky good cop bad cop routine and the next thing you know were doing five to ten in attica
drew checks her watch
so well turn ourselves in right after the interview
may i make one suggestion
hit the showers before you do anything else
a beep beep indicates parkers blackberry is receiving a message
were facing felony charges parker
maybe you can do your on line flirting later
better yet he can see you during visitors hours
parker reads the incoming message from
beat epiphany oh my god
warren works in the city
so you lied right to my face
no drew this isnt about the chat room guy
but parkers typing furiously even as drew rants on she has to lean around speedys legs
a guy buying a newspaper peers down at the strange sight
to guy take your daughters to work day
the guy pays for his paper leaves
are you listening to me
give me that stupid thing
drew reaches for the blackberry
knock it off drew
this guy might be able to help
he lives here
parker you have completely lost your mind if you can be thinking about boys at a time like this
to drew the united nations
you cant possibly know somebody who works at the united nations
maybe he meant united sub sandwiches
or united skate rats store
parker pockets the blackberry
were going to the united nations to use the restroom
you arrange a little date while your sisters future hangs in the balance
look he said hed help and its only a couple blocks away
you got a better idea
speedy opens the rear door of the newsstand
hows he know
thank you mr
youre quite welcome
good luck in that interview
drew sighs then reluctantly follows parker out
macleod house charleys study head thrown back mouth wide open still in his bathrobe charley sleeps in the chair directly in front of his laptop
the screensaver an animated version of jack nicholson in the shining just keeps typing all work and no play
when the phone rings it nearly knocks him out of his chair
he hunts it down through the maelstrom on his desk
to phone wal mart
beat hey marvin
he glances at the screensaver the same words pouring out
suddenly concerned today
beat gee im on a real roll marv
the juices overfloweth if you get my meaning
dont want to plug the juices when theyre overflowing right
whoa how much
i guess i could carve out some time
charley smells his armpit
hell need a quick shower
see you in the city
charley hangs up punches a key on his computer
the screensaver disappears and up pops a blank page
at the top chapter one
charleys driving eating a sandwich and dialing his cell phone at the same time veering dangerously and obliviously across the center stripe
the oncoming car careens out of his way in a blaze of horn
to phone hello beautiful doctor lady
how goes your day
right next to the magazine rack
what did they name it newsweek
beat im going into the city to meet some big shot publisher
maybe ill swing by nyu afterwards and see if i can give drew a ride home
you talk to her today
beat shes probably having too much fun to call
ill ring her up
he hangs up and of course veers into the other lane again correcting wildly before resuming his merry way
far below garden employees set up for the dog show
inside the lo bianchos luxury box is likewise being prepared
in one corner bruce and morty are fumbling with the unfamiliar electronic tracing gear readying for the ransom call
lo biancho turns up her nose at the buffet table
to caterer what are those
you might as well wrap dog turds in bacon
take them away
a society friend of mrs
lo biancho babs arrives to pay her respects shuffling her feet across and leaning in to trade air kisses
i shudder to think how the poor emperor may be suffering
im at wits end
when she turns on morty and bruce they both jump a little
putting on a show you
tell the thieves ill pay anything they want
what price on a loved one
ive got to run
that stupid groomer used a commercial conditioner on coco and she looks like trailer trash
babs nabs one of the rumaki on her way out
as soon as babs is gone mrs
lo biancho looms over morty and bruce
ill give them ten grand tops but only if the dogs back before show time
a troubled bruce isnt having much luck operating the trace machine
aside to morty whispered do you know how to turn this on
the girls try to be as inconspicuous as possible walking cross town in couture drew with only one shoe and in a bad mood
were going to make it drew
theres still plenty of time
youll get cleaned up we can trade clothes
this is a nice suit huh
youre going to get accepted then we can explain the misunderstanding about the dog to the police and everything will be okay
maybe after the police forgive us for sneaking into someone elses hotel room we can ask them to please keep the mob hit man from whacking us and dropping us
into the marina so he doesnt get his suit dirty
first things first
parker i know youre trying to cheer me up but i have to be honest
this is all your fault
beat my fault
i didnt mean for any of this to happen
like you didnt mean to ask bernie lipscomb to the prom
whats that supposed to mean
ill bet that was just another accident of yours that happened to screw up my life
drew didnt want to admit that it just slipped out under pressure
you liked bernie too
you know i did
no i didnt
i havent seen you talk to a guy since we were in kindergarten and we thought jerry wester was a girl
you asked bernie just to snake him from me
i did not
beat wow the really spooky thing is that would mean we liked the same guy
a block away the united nations building stands majestically against the sky
directly in front of them however a police car is stopped at the light with two uniformed policemen inside
the girls spot the police and stop
the police look up at the girls through their windshield
their on board fax is spitting out an apb photo
the policeman on the passenger side pulls it off and holds it up
isnt that those two right there
he shows the photo to his partner whos driving
ill be damned
but when they look up the girls are gone
they dont take much notice of a horse drawn carriage passing them with the driver up front and two tourists kissing in the back
where the hell did they go
as the carriage clops past however the policemen dont notice the girls both clinging to the back
into radio to base
we spotted the dognapping suspects corner of st and th
from radio copy that
hogan and williamson are eating sandwiches but theyve paused to listen from radio car reports suspects spotted at st and th
hogan picks up the radio while williamson fires up the to radio do you still have visual
but they cant be far
theyre on foot
to hogan thats over by the u
to radio see if you can pick them up
were on our way
williamson blasts crosstown
the horse carriage passes the usual groups of protestors and tourists outside on the u
the girls jump off and move into the crowd headed for the entrance where theres a line at the door
down the block the detectives unmarked car appears and parks at the curb
williamson and hogan climb out scanning the crowd
pointing there they are
just a glimpse as they enter the building
what in the world could they be doing here
the girls pass through the metal detector and move toward a small group of tourists waiting by the sign that reads re warren do you see him
parker consults the jpeg pic on her blackberry then scans the group
at the head of the group the u
tour guard geeky in a clark kent way and nice enough looking but definitely not a male model leans into a petite brunette and her little conspiratorially i cant tell
you how much ive looked forward to this
the brunette looks at him like hes a serial killer
in russian momma
her fierce looking babushka mom gets in the tour guides face
this is when drew notices williamson and hogan entering and approaching a u
security guide flashing their badges
out loud warren
does anyone know warren collier
the tour guide warren collier looks over at them
warren moves back to drew and parker
isnt that strange
i didnt recognize you from your picture
yeah i uh
urgently we dont have time for this now
do you have an office or someplace private we could go
i just have to do this tour and
but williamson and hogan led by the u
security guy enter the lobby
drew grabs warren by the arm and turns him
well get back to that
whats going on
parker looks warren right in the eye
this is a test
let me get somebody to cover for me
warren leads them into a small adjoining office
where another tour guide is taking a break
hey angie take the for me will you
judge judys on
drew grabs angie by the collar lifts her up
to warren you owe me warren
angie heads out to take the tour
parker turns on warren
are you a lying sack or what
what was i supposed to do
i liked you
if id sent a real picture would you have met me
thats not the point
that means no
at least this way i got to see you before you blow me off
no one is blowing you off warren
as a matter of fact were very happy to see you arent we parker
and were grateful for your help
this is my sister drew
not a twin huh
thats a joke
i guess everybody would like the world to see them a little bit differently than they are
quickly interjecting super
now that thats all settled is there a restroom i can get to without going out there
whats wrong with going out there
police for one thing
i thought you guys were joking
its the kind of joke that will be a lot funnier a few years from now
well that doors the only way out
theres a restroom at the end of the main hall
parker opens the office door peeking out
i dont see em
who parker cant see because her line of sight is blocked by the office door
they must be searching the building
whatd you guys do anyway
mug a couple supermodels
with warren leading the way they exit the office
the three make their way across the vast lobby but before they reach the main hall
spotting them hey
almost instinctively they go completely separate ways warren and parker breaking left drew right
drew makes a mad dash down a hallway makes a turn another turn working her way deeper into the labyrinth
even while running frantically she tries to smile politely at everyone she passes until she spots a womens room and quickly ditches inside
she hurriedly crosses enters a stall locks the door and puts her feet up
she tries to catch her breath
groans of pain echo from the stall next to her
somebodys in bad shape
another heart rending groan cant be ignored
to person in stall are you okay
near fatally nauseous ohhh
im so sick
the mussels at lunch
you have to help me
im kind of in my own private hell right now
whats your name
its vitally important
a file folder comes skidding from under the stall
you have to take this to canada
its sort of far away
struggling in the assembly
give the file to mr
wakefield the canadian representative
you want me to take this to the canadian representative to the united nations
this is a crisis
what can she possibly do
drew exits the stall and goes to the door
wheres the assembly
to the left
drew peeks out the door
it looks clear
out she goes
on the run warren and parker ditch through a door marked mailroom
a beat later hogan appears from around the corner
vacant and quiet
the door opens slowly and hogan enters
its a small room with a few canvas mail sacks piled in a corner and a wall of mail sorting cubbies
an in house monitor mutely broadcasts the now empty nothing here hogan closes the door
in a beat one of the mail sacks wriggles and warren sticks his head up
parker pops up from the same sack
face to face theres an awkward moment of attraction between them
no better idea you have nice breath
beat maybe we should get out of this sack
drew peeks in through the door reading the country identifications on the desks
bangkok borneo bulgaria
the representatives are in the middle of a heated debate that we hear being translated and we see in subtitles
chinese subtitles impossible
this would be globally destabilizing
pointing angry finger hah
posturing and rhetoric
the canadian representative is sitting gingerly in his chair shifting uncomfortably
he looks pale shaky
drew commits herself and rushes down the stairs to his desk with the file
he puts a hand to his stomach hes struggling
ugh groan yes
you didnt have the mussels at lunch too did you
even as she holds out the file he races past her puckering his bum
she watches him waddle up the stairs but as he exits he drew sees them
the only thing she can do to make herself inconspicuous is to drop into the canadian reps chair and turn her back on them like shes one of the assembly
she sits up shuffles the files around
glancing furtively to either side she sees that everyone else is wearing the translation earphone
she puts one on
williamsons gaze comes to rest on
the back of drews head
that looks familiar
this is when the chinese rep stands furious and points an accusatory finger at drew
this crisis falls at the feet of one nation and one nation only
how do you defend such a position
the world is waiting to hear
these are fighting words
the assembly grows silent
drew wishes she could beam herself somewhere off planet
she gulps air
glances left right
well im not certain
this furrows some brows
recovering that i need to defend our position
ah yes some knowing nods
on the north korean representative leaning over to confer with the norwegian representative subtitles is she new
that is absurd
she notices the file the rep in the bathroom gave her and holds it up shaking it for emphasis
dramatic emphasis not so absurd since i have the documents right here in my possession
this draws a chorus of murmurs throughout the hall
the chinese rep suddenly looks terribly worried and pauses to confer with his associate
parkers peeking through the door checking the hallway
how are we going to find drew
something tells me that wont be too tough
warren points to the monitor
parkers jaw drops
her sister is addressing the entire u
drew glances williamson exiting
and besides who said absurd is necessarily bad
sometimes absurd is good
for instance absurd can be sort of
in conclusion i propose that all of you should talk amongst yourselves
quickly thank you
like cinderella at midnight she turns and races up the stairs as the assembly is in complete turmoil kofi anan bangs his gavel
canada has proposed further debate
the united states of america seconds the motion
drew busts through the doors just as warren and parker come running with the detectives chasing them
the three of them make for the front door but a tour group comprised of a hundred young japanese girls blocks their exit
warren thinks fast and yells in japanese
jin zshe miya brad pitt
screaming like banshees the japanese girls all pour outside warren and the girls following
once outside he yells again
dingo cashito brad pitt ezukai
the japanese girls turn around and storm back through the doors blocking williamson and hogans exit
the three of them run for the line of taxis
you speak japanese
i may not look like an underwear model but im smarter than a hundred of them put together
warren grabs a taxi door
we dont have any money
im smart and rich
williamson and hogan have fought their way out through the little japanese girls
realizing they wont reach parker and drew in time they head for their own unmarked cruiser which is parked just ahead of
bennies town car
hes holding the door for a cigar chewing client but watching the girls climb into the cab up ahead
they jump into the back seat warren in the middle
parker leans urgently into the driver follow that
theyre following us parker
the taxi pulls away from the curb
williamson fires up the cruiser
maybe we should give them a little leash and see what they do with it
but were gonna have to stop for lunch pretty soon cause im getting heartburn
they pull into traffic following the cab
in a beat bennies town car follows too
parker leans across warren to drew
excuse me what were you doing
someone was sick in the bathroom and they asked me to hold on i dont owe you any explanation
youre the one all i gotta get to this interview or im gonna have a nervous breakdown and yet you have time to address the united nations
you know technically you have to have security clearance to enter the assembly
not now warren
you have a lot of nerve parker
it was you that got me tossed off the train
you had to give the bum that dollar
you get the suit i get the leather bikini
under which isnt so bad
and you got bernie lipscomb while i got scrabble with mom and dad
whos bernie lipscomb
i told you i didnt know you liked him
it was no big deal
it was to me
how could i know
you never tell me anything
theres a good reason for that
whats that supposed to mean
you know very well what it means ms
ooh i hope you miss that stupid interview
well the jokes on you because there isnt any interview
this just slipped out in anger
parkers brain has to adjust then what
beat no interview
i screwed up
you screwed up what
scheduling the interview
drew doesnt screw anything up let alone scheduling
youre the iron chef of scheduling
i missed the deadline
after they made the first cut from the preliminary application we were supposed to send in a form to secure our interview time and i filled it out and had
everything ready to go in the mailbox and then
drew is near tears
and then what
i just forgot
when i found it in my bag a week later id missed the deadline
what are you doing
i was going to try to meet professor spaulding and
you were just going to jump him
sort of a guerilla interview
you know im a big michael moore fan
a look from parker quiets warren
drews choked up
she just nods yes
i called and the secretary said there were no exceptions to the deadline so i was going to try to see him when he finished the other interviews
i knew it was hopeless but
i was so
drew wipes her tears then oh to hell with it
she opens the door and jumps out
drew get back in this taxi
parker starts to open her door on the traffic side
its nearly sheared off by a passing truck and she closes it just in time
shes pretty upset
gee you really are a genius
as the taxi bogs down in traffic drew disappears around the corner up ahead
talk about spontaneous
tears running drews walking too quickly for the one stupid shoe
she nearly turns her ankle
darn it darn it darn it
this is when she sees parked just down the block
rogers van with michelangelos painting across the back door
thats the painter
drew quickly steps into the shadow of a doorway to keep out of sight and watch the van
williamson and hogan have the same problem with the traffic and cant see clearly whats going on up ahead
did one of them just get out
i think so
maybe shes going for the dog
maybe thats what they want us to think
so we stay with the taxi
unless you want to hoof it after the other one
we stay with the taxi
roger dials a cell phone while the emperor stands on the passenger seat with his front paws on the dash
as far as we can tell hes having a great time being kidnapped and doesnt mind being mauve
get in the back will ya
the emperor ignores him happily watching the streets of new york go by
but his call has gone through
he imitates a girls as girl hello
lo biancho calmly answers her cell phone
morty and bruce have their tracing gear rigged to her phone but have to keep following her around the box
girl voice throughout if you want to see your dog alive again listen closely
i want a hundred thousand dollars transferred into this numbered swiss account
interrupting ill give you ten grand but only if hes in madison square garden in
she looks to her husband who consults his watch and then holds up one finger
take it or leave it
bruce signals her keep him on the line
you have one minute to decide
she hangs up
bruce and morty sigh
roger looks at the phone
it wasnt supposed to go like that
he looks at the emperor
you can wipe that stupid smile off your face
i dont think they love you as much as you think they do
he glances at his watch
he believes mrs
lo biancho and is panicking
parker and warren are scanning the sidewalk ahead for drew
whered she go
i think she took a right up there
to driver follow my sister
i thought we were the ones being followed
stay flexible will you please
they turn right
he hits redial
lo biancho answers
heres how we make the interrupting again first of all you forgot to disguise your voice
to himself damn it
secondly my husband will meet you in ten minutes on the corner of rd and broadway
hell have the money
bring the dog
but thats ridiculous
youll just bring the police
consider him kung pau
dont hang up
the police it appears have other priorities like humans or something
and i assure you the hotel security
will not interfere
in any case little man we just want the dog back before showtime do you understand
she hangs up
roger does too
to the emperor no wonder you look so happy
as far as youre concerned youve escaped from the wicked witch of the west
drew watches as roger climbs out looks up and down the street then moves around to the passenger side grabs the emperor and drops him into a gym bag
at the end of the block spectators for the new york kennel club dog show have begun filing into the garden
ever wary roger carries the emperor under one arm
the emperor pokes his nose out
roger pushes it back in
the dog pokes it back out
to emperor knock it off
from behind drew grabs the emperor and takes off running
give me that dog
holding the emperor at arms length drew makes a run for it with roger after her
i just want you to know that im allergic to you and cynophobic
she and roger race right past
lo biancho holding out the saks bag of money
i cant stop
i have to return this dog
ill be right back
lo biancho falls in line behind roger keeping up pretty well for an old dude with a gut
uh isnt that your sister
it cant be
shes terrified of dogs
they round the corner behind parker and warren
im telling you i got a hunch these girls dont have anything to do with this dog
drew blows past them holding the emperor
the detectives exchange glances nice hunch and they just as he turns the corner the parade passes him
what the hell
the emperors having the time of his life
he licks drews face joyfully as she weaves through the growing crowd
reveals a uniformed policeman doing security at the delivery entrance to the garden where show participants wheeling their dog kennels are being checked in by two drew draws a bead
on the policeman determined to reach him and hand over the emperor officer
but show official appears from inside taps the policeman on the shoulder they need him inside
he turns and goes through the door just as
drew reaches the loading dock and hustles up the stairs
she sprints past the other show officials checking in miss
you cant go in without credentials
drew has entered her own personal circle of hell dogs to no one everyone wheres the policeman
a groomer combing a hound dog points toward the curtains on the far side of the room and she blasts off that direction
close on the hound dog lifting his big nose in the air he sniffs mightily and then
baying like hes coon hunting under a kentucky moon the hound dog leaps off his table heads after drew
the two show officials sporting nifty sweaters and manicures are prepared to sacrifice their lives to block the door
in addition to the participants trying to get inside theyre holding off roger mr
lo biancho williamson and hogan
quite disturbed no entry without official credentials
im emile lo biancho
i demand to be let in
at the mention of police rogers eyes go wide
he slinks down losing himself in the crowd and sidles off
chin set ill have to see identification officers
lo biancho im so sorry mr
go right in
at the corner parker and warren keep their distance not wanting to be seen by the detectives
you think she made it
shes faster than she looks
she is but now shes not running to catch a policeman but to try to keep from being over taken by
the roar of the crowd and the barking of the pack draw the attention of everyone in the lo bianchos box
isnt that the emperor maam
drew makes it across the floor and out the other side into a tunnel
appearing in the concession area
as it breaks off jumps onto a concession stand and begins looting it
drew makes for the exit past the ticket takers who leap out of the way and just as she reaches the door and pushes it open
williamson hogan morty bruce mr
lo biancho and quite a few spectators pour out the doors
ill get hives
resigned oh go ahead
the detectives appear above her
she holds up the emperor
i uh just wanted to return him
as the other owners and handlers gather their dogs williamson hands the emperor off to mrs
lo biancho while hogan handcuffs drew
step aside and ill whip her myself
dead calm didnt you say it was a man who called dear
so she had an accomplice
well beat the information out of the little wench
handing him the emperor get him cleaned up emile
williamson and hogan move drew toward their car
i didnt take her dog i swear
well sort it out
but i have this interview
i mean its not really an interview
id never lie to the police
its over never mind
just as they push her head down into the car she glimpses a vaguely familiar face among the myriad gawkers its the bike messenger
for just an instant they lock eyes before the car pulls away
parker and warren round the corner at a run only in time to watch the detectives car leave with drew in the back window
we have to go to the jail and tell them what happened
what on earth did happen
she wanted to get into that program more than anything in the world
with a sigh they turn to go and bump knock into bennie whos staring coldly down at parker
you goin somewhere
shes paralyzed with fear
gulp hello sir
oh my god
please dont kill me
we dont know anything at all
we didnt see anything or hear anything and ill swear to that in a court of law
bennie appears unmoved
parker closes her eyes trying to meet death with dignity
just not in the face
whats the big idea
you two a couple a nutbags or somethin
she opens one eye
i mean yes
is there a right answer to that
see my sister had this interview which turned out not to be an interview really and i sort of messed things up because i wanted to meet him
you came into town just for me
not now warren
back to bennie drew was going to be late even though technically she wasnt going to be late since there wasnt an interview and thats when we got in your
i promise we meant to pay
it was a true emergency
i meant why you runnin when im trying to give you your bag back
bennie hands parker drews daybag
parker takes it still trying to comprehend
you were just
i found your moms number in the book
she said you needed it pretty badly for that big interview
listen i gotta go
its my mother in laws birthday and i gotta plant some stupid rose bush and then take her out to dinner at the pier
see ya around
bennie waddles over to his town car and climbs in
beat calling after thank you
well he certainly is a good samaritan
parker looks at the daybag
you guys lead a pretty interesting life dont you
but now parkers mind is elsewhere
she pulls out drews daybook opens it
we going to the jail or what
ive never been to a jail before
what time is it
a mugs hot is taken of drew looking as bedraggled beaten and defeated as humanly possible
staring at her ink stained fingers as hogan finishes fingerprinting her other hand
he hands her a towel to wipe them off
we know that dirty hands would drive the old drew crazy
this drew merely tosses the towel into the garbage
who gives a crap
drew sits among other female criminals staring zombie like
an inmate with freaky frazzled red hair and a whacked out look in her eye sidles over to drew
i love your outfit
is it bobo
how in the world would this woman know
yes as a matter of fact it is
hes a genius
off drews look of complete spiritual resignation we warren and parker leap from a cab and hustle across campus
in only a few strides parkers dusting him
try to keep up warren
calling after her hey
im an intellectual
i never claimed to be athletic
as a matter of fact i was excused from p
because of an ascended testicle
realizing too much information right
red points at drews one shoe
do you mind
im a fanatic for jimmy choo
its all yours
she hands the high heel to red who enthusiastically pulls it on and models it
hogan enters opens the cell door
youre free to go
ill just stay here with the girls
an eyewitness says he saw who took the dog
didnt realize the guy was stealing it until he saw us grab you
hogan takes her by the arm in a fatherly way and leads her out
hogan leads her into the lobby where bike messenger guy is waiting
he stands up when he sees drew
her dissonance is even more confounded now
theres your alibi
i dont even know him
thats what he said
get cleaned up a good nights sleep
none of this will seem so bad in the morning
hogan leaves them alone
bike guy steps over
as an answer drew merely points to herself look at me
now answer for yourself
im jim wessler
howd you know
who could forget that face
reminded drew puts a hand to her face
suddenly realizing just how awful she must look drew becomes self conscious
she walks past him out the door
where are you going
jim catches up to her
thanks for getting me out of jail but i have to go home now because my entire life is ruined
bad day huh
you turn understatement into an art
can you just tell me your name
sigh im drew macleod
the girl who wont be going to the nyu accelerated program
drew looks at her watch
because short of flying theres no way to get from here to nyu in five minutes
sure there is
parkers on the stairs with drews daybook open staring into it like someone who has a final exam in two minutes but forgot to show up for the semester
warrens looking over her shoulder
and i thought i was anal
this is no good
i dont do too well with the whole rehearsal thing
im more of a wing it person
parker checks herself in her reflection in the glass
working herself into drew form she puts her hair into a conservative bun and then tries straightening her posture
all business hows this look
you know ive always had a thing for librarians
warren honesty is fine
but you could edit a little you know
wish me luck
good luck drew
about to knock on a door that reads professor que spaulding phd when the door suddenly opens and the last interviewee steps out in a suit and tie confidence oozing
parker nods primly as he passes then steps inside
a secretary sits at her computer
she looks over her glasses at parker
may i help you
im here to see professor spaulding
you dont have an appointment
beat um no
this is when the inner office door swings open and the professor himself coat over one arm briefcase in the other steps out
parker positions herself directly in front of him cutting off his exit
may i have a moment of your time
im sorry but i have a plane to catch
he tries to make a move
parker blocks him
but this is very important
what is this about
life and death if you must know
the professor hesitates for just an instant giving parker her opening
she grabs his hand giving it a vigorous young republican shake
im drew macleod
macleod i hope this is interesting
students leisurely make their way between classes
the students dive out of the way as jim comes barreling across campus with drew clinging for life to his handlebars
just outside the administration building jim hits the brakes and drew flies off the handlebars and like the puppy in the opening disappears into a shrub
the old drew is back
she scrambles out of the shrub
and up the stairs then stops turns
wait right there
beat i mean i dont want to be bossy
you dont have to stay right there if you dont want to
ill be right here
she launches herself into the building
parker sits genteelly forward in her chair legs crossed just so at the ankles hands folded in her lap
primly i promise you though my missing the deadline seems to suggest otherwise my studies would never suffer on account of my being unorganized
this was and i think anyone who knows me would vouch for this a complete anomaly
i was so thrown when my sister asked bernard to the dance that i simply failed to post the schedule request and seeing it already checked off on my to
do list i over looked it until after the deadline had passed
macleod i recall your application being one of the strongest we received
not seeing your name on the interview list surprised me
i assumed of course that youd changed your mind
not at all
this program is my number one priority
yes well im sure you can appreciate that with so many applicants for so few spaces there must be rules to govern the selection process
a fuss from the outer office interrupts them and suddenly the door bursts open and drew bursts in professor spaulding
i cant apologize enough for barging in like this
the professor is not only thrown by the interruption but by drews particularly bizarre barefoot look
it looks like im taking the red eye now anyway
drew shuts the door and then is startled when she gets a face full of parker already there
worried wink hi parker
what are you doing
dont blow it oh the professor and i have had a wonderful talk about how important this program is to me and how it was my sister drew who screwed
im having a little trouble following this
to drew would you like to sit down
seeing her plan to help drew go awry poor parkers lip trembles
when i saw them take you to jail
i didnt think youd make it
i knew i wouldnt be any good at it but i figured at least there was a chance
youre not mad
im so sorry for today
but lets talk about it later
go right ahead
parker consider just for a moment whether this is the appropriate time and place
okay i considered
what i want to say is i didnt purposefully set out to ruin your day but that doesnt mean im not a little
im not like you
i dont have your intensity your focus your
i just mean maybe even if i dont intend to maybe that jealousy you know gets in the way sometimes
you mean subliminally youre undermining me
i dont know if id get that technical about it
well thank you for saying that
beat arent you going to confess now
theres got to be something
like how you lost your shoes
how youre secretly jealous of me
why would i be jealous of you
oh let me see
because i dont have a stick up my butt
because i know how to have fun
because im spontaneous and creative and men are all my love slaves
drew stops ponders this deeply
then she smiles only a teensy bit
well maybe about the love slaves
this is the first moment in a long time when the sisters share a smile
drew turns to the professor
professor im drew macleod
are you certain
i wanted more than anything in the world to be a part of your program
i still do
but i failed
i didnt follow the rules
and honestly before today i didnt know how i was going to live with that
how to live with failure
im not good at it
i havent done it much
but today i realized that ive lived in fear of it too long
i hope my application was a strong one and i came here today to ask your indulgence and to place my name back into consideration
if you wont ill understand
better yet ill get over it
maybe i shouldnt be in such a hurry after all
maybe it would be best for me to just take this
drew takes her daybook from parker and drops it in the wastebasket
and lighten up
parker looks horrified at the sight of drews daybook in the trash and fishes it out
thanks for your time
sorry if you missed your plane
he shakes her hand
it was worth it i assure you
now could you clear up one thing for me
whats this about jail
warren and jim sit waiting when the girls come out smiling
drew turns to parker
the sisters hug but we go
parker grabs warren by the hand and blasts around the corner just as
charley macleod pulls up in his truck and parks half on half off the curb
he leans over waving to drew
drew goes over to the truck
i was in the city
i tried to call you
thought you might want a ride home
is that a new outfit
hey one minute kay
drew goes back to jim
you want to maybe
first i want to take a shower
for about a week
drew leans over and kisses him on the cheek
then she reaches into her bag and pulls out a card
call me okay
you have a card
arent you in high school
she smiles shrugs and climbs in her dads truck
they pull away leaving jim waving
when theyre out of sight parker and warren come back around the corner of the building
ill never get home before them
sure you will
warren pulls out a cell phone hits speed dial
i need a favor
passing over the city warren and parker are strapped in headphones on and have to talk above the din
warren something tells me youre spoiled
but in a good way
both girls are putting on makeup getting ready to go out
everything appears the same as before drews side neat and clean parkers a wreck
quinn steps in grimfaced
how naive do you think i am
the girls share a look
we uh dont think youre naive mom
honestly it was all an accident
quinn holds out her hand revealing a belly ring
i know what this is
theres almost a palpable sense of relief between the girls
they both look down and pull up their shirts parkers not the only one who has her naval pierced drew does too
parker im disappointed youd do something like this without consulting me but drew
what got into you
do you know how unhygienic those places are
oh by the way
she holds out her other hand which has an envelope
this came in the mail
they stare at the envelope nyu admissions department
theres a honk
the guys are here
parker and quinn stare at drew
it doesnt really matter one way or the other
maybe i shouldnt be in such a hurry
why dont we go out and have some fun
besides if this isnt good news i dont want it to ruin our night
parker and quinn simply continue to stare
macleod living room evening charleys laying on the couch with some chips on his stomach watching the game
jim and warren are watching too
so howd you two meet the girls
jim and warren share a look
this is a story best left untold
simultaneously a dance a class
dance class huh
i figured it had to be that day in new york when parker blew off her chem test and drew was in jail
hes not as out of it as he appears
suddenly all three women scream joyfully o
