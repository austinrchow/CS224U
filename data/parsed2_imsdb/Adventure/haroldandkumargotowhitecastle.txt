billy nods knowingly

some hot chick riding your jock all night long

it would help get your mind off of sarah
billy ponders this for a moment
even if i wanted to meet other women i wouldnt even know what to do

berenson needs me to update the financial models for his meeting with the foreign investors

he has an idea
harold lee years old the typical asian american workhorse youll find in any investment bank is packing up his briefcase getting ready to leave for the day
billy and j

confused but arent you supposed to
i know but something came up

harold doesnt like this but before he even has a chance to protest j
and make sure its in tomorrow by nine oclock sharp
contd with all the downsizing going on around here we wouldnt want to have to tell berenson that youve been slacking

billy drops a big stack of papers on harolds desk

and with that j
presses a button in his car that causes the top of the convertible to go down and a funky white boy song kicks in
intercut billy and j
think theyre hot shit as they cruise through the parking lot blasting their tunes
when the lyrics kick in j
begins lip syncing passionately
billy loves it
when the chorus begins the guys begin dancing in their seats in an unrealistic synchronized choreographed manner
gives a thumbs up to an elderly parking attendant as his car zooms out of the parking lot
quick boom up from j
s convertible and push in to harold standing at a window watching as billy and j
he looks at the stack of papers they gave him
kumar patel indian funky hair is answering questions from his nyu medical school interviewer dr
woodruff middle aged erudite very professional
kumar has no accent
mononucleosis or mono is an infection caused by the epstein barr virus
symptoms may include fever sore throat headaches white patches on the back of your throat swollen glands sluggishness and loss of appetite
i have to say youre one of the best applicants ive ever interviewed
not that its a surprise
your father is very respected in his field
you know he and i had some pretty wild times when we were in med school
we started our own basketball team the hemoglobin trotters
cracking up yeah we were crazy
kumar nods and smiles
woodruff finally stops laughing
anyway just one more question
reading from a clipboard what are some potential symptoms of pancreatitis
there might be epigastric tenderness diffuse abdominal tenderness
suddenly we hear what sounds like be a match being lit a gurgle and a cough the distinct sounds of somebody smoking from a bong
woodruff is confused
kumar pulls out his cell phone
its his personalized ringer
woodruff im sorry
can you hold on one second
kumar stands up and answers his cell phone
into the phone kumars phone
listening oh hey
listening nothing important
i can talk
woodruff is offended
he takes a sip of from a mug of coffee and watches as kumar begins pacing around the office
intercut harold is talking on his office phone
im not gonna be able to partake in our usual friday night ritual
ive gotta stay late at the office
into the phone fuck that shit
we had plans
woodruff cant believe kumars choice of words
i know but i gotta get this work done
oh come on
when has getting high ever prevented you from finishing your work
woodruff is so shocked that the mug of coffee simply slips out of his hands
hot coffee goes all over his shirt
woodruff yells and starts wiping his shirt with a napkin
listen id love to go home but
no fucking buts
i just bought a quarter of the finest herb in new york city and im not smoking it alone
kumar contd so youre just gonna have to chill the fuck out bring your work home and prepare to get blazed because in a couple of hours i expect both
of us to be blitzed out of our skulls
see you later
kumar hangs up the phone and sits back down
woodruff is stunned
woodruff okay where was i
more symptoms of pancreatitis
decreased bowel sounds possibly fever dehydration and sometimes even shock
this is supposed to be a proper interview
do you actually believe after the way youve behaved that i would ever even consider recommending you for admission
id actually be pretty surprised
woodruff is flustered
he doesnt know how to react
look im just interviewing so my dad will keep paying for my apartment
im not really planning on going to med school
you have perfect mcat scores
well im not an idiot
woodruff is at a loss for words
kumar notices a framed picture of a hot teenage girl on dr
he picks it up
is this your daughter
a disturbed dr
woodruff grabs the portrait out of kumars hands
harold shuts down his laptop
he then puts the laptop along with all his paperwork into a bag and leaves the office
harold walks to the end of the parking lot where his car is parked
as he walks the strap of his laptop bag breaks and falls to the ground
harold is frustrated as he picks it up
after other cars zoom through uninterrupted the elderly parking attendant stops harold and checks his id before letting him leave
harolds driving his white infiniti g
he finds a spot
right in front
harold carefully lines up his car to parallel park
as he starts to pull in a yellow jeep steals the spot from behind
the jeep is loaded with alternative stickers and has a kayak hang glider and other sports equipment on the roof
harold almost hits the jeep
he knows this car
frustrated to himself those assholes
the driver cole s asshole high energy intense loud mouth puts down his window
cole is joined in the jeep with his extreme sports punk friends who all laugh at harold
mock asian accent this is america dude
learn how to drive
better ruck tomorrow
frustrated harold turns around and continues driving
he ends up parking far from the building
he has to parallel park
hes anal with his parking going in and out a bunch of times until the car is positioned perfectly in the spot
harold walks a bunch of blocks to his apartment building
he walks up the steps to the lobby entrance of his building
suddenly he stops in his tracks
through the glass door he sees
maria a beautiful sweet looking young woman of puerto rican descent
shes standing by the elevators
harold cant move
this is his dream girl
harold takes a deep breath
okay be yourself
dont be nervous
harold enters the building and walks over to maria
they give each other a friendly smile
we hear a bing sound indicating the elevator has arrived
the doors open and harold and maria walk inside
harold and maria are standing silently as the elevator goes up
eventually harold gets the courage to speak
so maria whats been going on
its just been a long week
how about you
my week was great
work wasnt too bad
i caught up on some sleep
plus the guy who works next to me decided to bathe for a change
deadpan oh wait i meant the exact opposite of that
i barely slept
and the guy next to me still smells like crap
but a man can dream right
harolds pleased that his joke worked
so what are you up to tonight
actually im probably gonna work out a little bit clean up the apartment and then go over to my boyfriends place
hes cooking me a really nice dinner
smiling oh wait i meant the exact opposite of that
beat ill actually probably just sit on my ass eat a pint of hagaan daz and watch blind date
playful that sounds awful
harold laughs as does maria
they smile at each other
well if you want some company maybe you could sit on your ass at my place
we hear the bing of the elevator
were back in the lobby
everything that just happened was a fantasy
harold and maria enter the elevator
harold and maria stand silently while the elevator goes up
its clear harold wants to say something but he doesnt have the courage
they reach their floor and exit the elevator
maria walks over to her apartment and goes inside
tired and frustrated harold enters his apartment
the place is minimally decorated with one of the highlights being a poster of billy madison
yeah im in here
harold walks over to kumars room and looks inside
its martha stewarts nightmare dirty laundry all over the floor etc
on his walls we see old school gangsta rap posters
marijuana paraphernalia is everywhere
we see a giant photograph of kumar with his arm around mr
kumar is not in the room however
curious harold walks over to his room neat tidy ikea furnishings where he sees kumar standing butt naked in front of a full length mirror
theres a clipping sound coming from kumars direction
harold stares at him shocked and appalled
harold walks inside
kumar what the hell are you doing
im trimming my pubes
kumar looks at himself in the mirror as he makes a couple more snips
on the floor we see large clumps of hair
why arent you doing this in your room
the mirrors in here
re his crotch hey check it out
it looks like a bonsai tree
im gonna puke
get your clothes on
it makes my johnson look bigger
besides if i dont do this ill end up with pubes like my dad
youve seen osama bin ladens beard right
harold notices something
are those my scissors
oh my god
i trim my nose hair with those
dude ive been cutting my ass hair with them for the past six months
kumar puts the scissors down and exits the room
harold shakes his head and sets up his laptop on his desk
kumar puts on some boxers and a t shirt i love bush the pussy not the president
calling out to harold so what the hell is your problem anyway
other than my roommates boney ass
harold turns on his laptop and is ready to start working
calling out one of the senior analysts asked me to do a bunch of his work for him tonight
kumar walks back into harolds room
i assume you gave him the appropriate go fuck yourself
if by go fuck yourself you mean no problem sir then yes he got the message loud and clear
kumar shakes his head in disgust
oh no wonder you tried cancelling on me today
dude you gotta learn how to say no once in a while
now lets get high
i got a lot of work to finish
kumar shuts harolds laptop
youll have plenty of time to get that shit done later
come on lets smoke a couple joints
harold thinks for a moment and then caves
one and a half
now lets do this
kumar exits the room
harold hangs his jacket up in his closet which we see organized in rows of suits and button downs
kumar walks over to a table in the living room where he finds an m
test prep book
kumar lifts open the cover inside we see a hollowed out circle filled with marijuana
kumar smells it and shudders in ecstasy
the phone next to the book starts to ring
kumar doesnt care
he lets it ring until the answering machine picks up
on the answering machine kumar
it is daddy
i hope your interview today was good
im calling to remind you that you have another one tomorrow morning with dr
wein from cornell at a
do not be late
kumar rolls his eyes as he tears some pages from the m
book and starts rolling a fat blunt
it is very important you show up on time
mommy and i will be very upset if you do not go
good luck kumar
remember the meeting is at ten oclock
harold still wearing his button down shirt only now untucked enters the living room
kumar is now licking the blunt
dont you think you should take at least one of your interviews seriously
at some point your dads gonna get really pissed
its not like theres a shortage of dr
patels out there
my dads a doctor
my brothers a doctor
just because everyone in my family went to med school doesnt mean i have to
well then what are you going to do
ill tell you what im gonna do
im gonna smoke this fat blunt get ridiculously high and then get something to eat
sounds like a plan
harold takes the first hit off the blunt
he nods to kumar as if to say thats good shit
kumar takes the blunt from harold and inhales
harold and kumar are now smoking out of an enormous bong while watching tv
the room is filled with smoke
its an episode of the router workshop
i think weve already seen this one
harold changes the channel
its an anti marijuana commercial
two teenagers are listening to rock music in a house without parents
one teenager blonde passes a joint to the other brown haired
come on dude
just take one hit
dont you want to be cool
nervously brown haired kid takes a hit of the joint
right after he exhales he walks over to his dads gun rack and takes out a long rifle
hey man what are you doing
im so high
nothing can hurt me
the brown haired kid puts the end of the rifle in his mouth
we see blonde haired kid in slow motion go nooooo
theyre laughing their asses off at the commercial
i love that shit
harold continues flipping channels
we see a news report tonight
a cheetah escaped from the morristown zoo
angle harold and kumar harolds not interested
he continues flipping
sixteen candles is on
and the award for least heterosexual statement ever made in this apartment goes to
kumar contd mock opening an envelope harold lee
come on down
take a bow
oh come on
its a john hughes movie
its a classic
its a beautiful story about someone who feels unnoticed unappreciated unloved
kumar points to the tv where we see a clip from sixteen candles long duk dong talking about quiche round pie kumar laughs
harold isnt amused
we see another clip long duk talking about the chores he does for the grandparents
hey when are you gonna start doing some chores around here
harold gives kumar a dont even joke look
he then violently grabs the bong from kumar and lights it
kumar laughs as harold exhales a lot of smoke
were so high right now
were not low
i dont know about you but im hungry as balls
harold bends down and picks up a bunch of delivery menus that have been left on the floor
nah i dont feel like delivery tonight
what about kfc
nah weve been there too many times
beat i want something we havent had in awhile
something thatll really hit the spot
i want the perfect food
are you hungry
harold and kumar turn their attention to the tv where they see a white castle commercial taking place
in the commercial we see dozens of tiny burgers lined up in a row
then come to white castle and try our slyder special six burgers fries and a soft drink for only
harold and kumar start salivating as they see the steam rise imagine all those burgers in your stomach right now
harold and kumar move closer to the tv to smell the burgers
dont you like food thats tasty and delicious
almost in a trance harold and kumar nod agreeingly
then what are you waiting for
head over to white castle
its what you crave
the commercial ends
harold and kumar look at each other this is clearly an emotional moment for both of them
harold and kumar exit their apartment
youre sure you know how to get there
i havent been to white castle in ages
im telling you theres one right around the corner from that multiplex in new brunswick
they walk down the hallway stopping at another apartment
on the side of the doorway is a mezuzah in the shape of a naked woman
harold and kumar walk in without knocking
harold and kumar walk into an apartment that looks almost identical to theirs
instead of a billy madison poster theres one of happy gilmore
sitting on the couch is rosenberg a seemingly nice jewish boy wearing khakis and a sweater and goldstein a more depraved jewish boy wearing a t shirt with a picture
of the olsen twins underneath the picture we see the words finally legal on june
both of them are taking bong hits out of a shofar bong while watching tv as harold and kumar enter
rosenberg goldstein get up
were going to white castle
rosenberg and goldstein continue staring at the tv
wait were watching the gift on hbo
out of the corner of kumars eye he notices harold grabbing a piece of beef jerky from rosenberg goldsteins coffee table
scolding harold put that down
were not eating til we get to white castle
harold acts like hes going to put the jerky back but as soon as kumar turns his attention back to rosenberg and goldstein he slips it his pocket
to rosenberg and goldstein now come on guys lets go
were not going anywhere
supposedly katie holmes shows her milk paps in this movie
is that all you jews ever think about
were talking about katie holmes here
you would never think a sweet innocent girl like her would ever take her top off
which is precisely why we have to watch her do it
dude the things id eat out of her ass you have no idea
beat bacon shellfish milk with meat you name it
to goldstein thats a very vulgar statement
so is i want to pound britney spears in the pussy
but its true
to harold and kumar anyway if you guys want to wait till the movies over
harold and kumar have already shut the door
harold presses the down button
kumar notices that harold has his laptop bag on his shoulder
what the hell are you bringing that for
harold hands kumar his keys
im gonna try to get some of my work done in the car
kumar then checks his pockets and comes up empty
shit i forgot my cell phone
why dont you just run back and get it
thinks for a moment nah weve gone too far
reveal that the guys are less than feet from their door
the elevator door opens and the guys enter
as harold and kumar enter we hear a door slam behind them
they turn around and see maria locking her door
she hasnt noticed harold and kumar yet
hey theres your girlfriend
you actually gonna talk to her this time
harolds answer becomes clear as he pushes the door closed button repeatedly
the door closes before maria sees them
what the hell are you doing
that was a perfect opportunity
you could have asked her if she wanted to go to white castle
harold doesnt say anything
he looks down in shame
im not worthwhile
harold and kumar exit the elevator
dude its only awkward because youre a pussy
just talk to her once and i promise you it wont be weird anymore
it doesnt matter
the only girls interested in me are girls i have no interest in
like cindy kim
speaking of cindy she called earlier
one of those asian clubs shes in is throwing a party at her dorm tonight
god she invites me to everything
shes fucking cute
let her touch your penis
they exit the front door of the building
harold and kumar walk down the steps where they see cole and the extreme sports punks doing lame skateboard tricks on the sidewalk near their jeep
theyre about to get back in the jeep when cole sees harold and kumar walking near them
hey look its the brothers mcfag
to harold and kumar let me guess the yellow ones the catcher
cole and the punks laugh hysterically
harold is uncomfortable
kumar just ignores them
to the punks come on guys
lets get ourselves some fucking mountain dew
they take off driving by harold and kumar
harold gives them a pissed off look as they drive away
why do i have to be the catcher
dude forget about those pricks
lets just go
they continue walking
harold and kumar finally reach harolds car
getting frustrated jesus that took forever
you know the purpose of a car is to avoid walking
beat and what kind of parking job is this
youre like a mile away from the curb
dont even start
laughing just fucking with you
now lets go out and get those burgers
im fucking starving
they get in the car and slam the door
the engine starts and the car takes off revealing that they were parked next to a we see harolds infiniti driving down the highway
harold is meticulously rolling a joint
hey rold do you think c po is gay
of course hes gay
you remember in the first star wars when he was like
in a gay c po voice thank the maker
this oil bath is going to feel soooo good
harolds infiniti approaches a line of toll booths
kumar pulls up to an exact change toll booth
dude give me thirty five cents
harold sorts through some change in his hand and gives kumar the money
kumar tosses the change into the basket and waits for the toll booth stoplight to turn green
whats going on
it didnt register
beat dude give me thirty five more cents
i dont have anymore change
should i just go through
i dont like breaking the law
harold licks the joint as he puts the finishing touches on
i can see that
a car honks behind them
kumar turns around and sees a number of cars lining up behind them
right behind them a big burly guy leans his head out of a car
move your ass
to harold im going through
just hold on
ill walk over to one of the manned booths and tell them what happened
the honking continues as harold starts to open the door
over the honking move you fucking twat
kumar cant take it anymore
just as harold is about to get out of the car kumar hits the gas and screeches away
are you crazy
oh shit were dead
harold throws the joint out the window
what the fuck is wrong with you
paranoid looking back you just tore out of there
the cops are gonna catch us
no theyre not
take this exit
we see harolds infiniti swerve onto the newark exit
harold and kumar drive through the dangerous streets of newark
theyre very quiet until kumar breaks the silence
that was the last of our weed
look i get a little paranoid sometimes
now were in newark of all places
you know were gonna get shot
maybe its not as bad as they say
its probably just a bunch of hype
they look out the window and see another asian and indian guy daniel and shankar walking down the street
suddenly three hoods jump out from an alley and start beating the living shit out of daniel and shankar
kumar gives harold a dirty look
lets get the hell out of here
kumar continues driving
he makes a turn
all of a sudden he stops short causing he and harold to jerk forward quickly
directly in front of harolds infiniti a basketball game is middle of the street
there are hoops on both sides
the basketball players briefly look over at harolds infiniti before continuing their game
dude we are not driving through that basketball game
we have to if we want to get out of here
kumar points to a sign indicating that the highway is ahead
forget about it
how do you know theyre not peaceful gregory hines like black guys
with that the hugest angriest black man of all time roars as he completes a monster dunk
in celebration he violently bumps chests with his teammates
turn the car around
are cars not allowed to go through when a games going on
when we were kids we used to move to the side when we were playing in the street
the hugest angriest black man stares harold and kumar down
for some reason i dont think this is the same thing
im going through
kumar begins inching forward
the basketball players slowly begin moving aside
i told you
even though the players are making way for harold and kumar theyre still no more than a foot or two from the car at all times
harold is scared shitless
he then notices the hugest angriest black man holding the basketball
shit hes gonna throw the ball at us
how do you know
look at him
the hugest angriest black man has an especially angry face
kumar puts the pedal to the metal and zooms away from them
the basketball players watch the car speed away
after a man you scared the shit out of them
make that face again
okay okay okay
the hugest angriest black man suppresses his laughter and tries to make the face
he bursts out laughing again
i cant do it
his friends laugh harder
he tries to regain his composure
he manages to make his angriest face for two seconds before bursting out laughing again
we see harolds infiniti back on the highway driving fast
that was close dude
kumar sees a highway sign new brunswick next exit
rold check it out
were almost there
well prepare to gorge yourself
we see harolds infiniti take the exit
harolds infiniti drives down a street loaded with mini malls and fast food joints
harold and kumar are looking for the white castle
oh man im so hungry
im gonna eat like twenty of those burgers
ill see your twenty and raise you five orders of fries
god where the hell is this place
dont worry well find it
harold sees a high school up ahead
theres the multiplex
that means the white castle should be just around the corner
what the hells going on kumar
that doesnt look like a white castle to me
we gotta get to the bottom of this
kumar drives right up to the pick up window where we see a chubby burger shack employee
you have to order at the drive thru menu
what happened to the white castle
there used to be a white castle right in this spot
where is it
remembering oh yeah
there was a white castle here
look guys i hate to be the bearer of bad news but burger shack bought this location four years ago
harold and kumar look at each other devastated
please tell me theres another white castle in town
are you sure
do i look like the type of guy who would be unsure about something like this
harold and kumar are freaking out
what are we gonna do
i dont know
should we just eat here
do you really think thatll satisfy us
the burger shack employee senses their desperation
theres a hour white castle in cherry hill about forty five minutes away
to harold i can make the trip if youre willing to
kumar i have a shitload of work to finish
and you have that med school interview in the morning
forget about the med school interview
its a non issue
if i may interject for a moment
beat ive been an employee here for three years now and if theres one thing ive learned its that when youre craving white castle the burgers here simply wont cut
in his own little world in fact just thinking about those tender little white castle burgers and those grilled onions makes me want to burn this place to the ground
and re build a white castle in its place
back to reality if i were you id suck it up and make the trip
kumar looks at harold
the guy makes a convincing case
harold is clearly torn
we sense that this is an important moment for the guys
enticing harold you can always do your work in the car
harold thinks for a moment then licks his lips
lets do it
then its settled
no matter what were not ending this night without white castle in our stomachs
kumar puts his hand out
harold shakes it
besides you wouldnt want to go near our special sauce tonight
some of the guys and i added an extra ingredient if you know what i mean
harold and kumar look confused
ill give you a hint
whispering its semen
we hear harold and kumar scream in disgust as harolds infiniti zooms out of the drive thru
harolds infiniti is back on the highway
kumar is driving with determination in his eyes
white castle here we come
i just wish we had some more pot
im almost completely sober right now
harold ignores this
hes typing feverishly on his laptop trying to get his work done
meanwhile kumar notices a sign on for the princeton exit
were getting off here
kumar takes the exit
were gonna sweet talk cindy kim into finding us some weed
im not seeing cindy
why the fuck not
you talk to her on the phone all the time
she calls me
then she rambles on about her east asian students club or whatever
harold contd and i have to pretend like i actually give a shit or shell call me a twinkie

im not seeing cindy kim
harold is sitting on a bed next to cindy kim very cute prim and proper korean girl
sitting on the floor are a dozen asian students pure stereotypes glasses nerdy clothes etc
harold is kind of creeped out by them
im so glad you showed up harold
did you like the hibiscus petals i glued to the envelope i sent you
suddenly one of the nerdy asian students kenneth raises his hand
harold looks at him strangely and then over to cindy
does this guy think im a teacher or something
harold sits there and stares at kenneth for a while
to kenneth uh yes
is it true youre an analyst at brewster keegan
yeah im a junior analyst
kenneth high fives with the nerdy asian student next to him
he then raises his hand again
harold rolls his eyes
uh this is actually a two part question
im applying for a summer internship at brewster keegan and i was wondering a what its like being an investment banker and b if you would write me a recommendation
what its like being an investment banker
well kenneth to be honest its pretty
harold looks into the eyes of the young eager asian students
he cant bear to tell them the truth
all the asian students start high fiving with each other
as for the recommendation i may be able to make a call or two
cindy looks at her watch
actually harold we should be getting to the party
we can discuss all this stuff there
its just down the hall
all the asian students get up
i cant go
i have to wait for kumar
youll see him when were done
trust me youre gonna love this
kennys mom dropped off a big jar of kimchi jigae
kenneth looks proud of himself
cindy grabs harolds hand and drags him away
kumar is standing in the hallway accosting random students
he sees one random student walk by
you know where i can get some chronic
the random student doesnt respond
kumar is frustrated
what kind of ivy league school is this
kumar exits the dorm and walks throughout the quad asking random students for drugs
eventually a hippie looking student phish t shirt birkenstocks taps kumar on the back
lookin to toke up
kumar breathes a sigh of relief
look just give me a dime of your finest herb
the hippie asshole opens his backpack
inside kumar sees a giant plastic bag filled with weed
oh my dear sweet lord
kumar reaches for the weed but the hippie asshole knocks his hand away
this is my baby man
hippie asshole sizes kumar up and then gives kumar him a measly dime bag
thatll be eighty bucks
its worth forty tops bro
the hippie asshole grabs the baggy back from kumar
im not your bro
and if you feel like staying sober go ahead dont buy it
thats cool with me
i can find lots of people who want to get high
i can smoke it myself man
jesus what the hell kind of hippie are you
one who understands the concept of supply and demand dude
kumar and the hippie asshole stare each other down
after a couple seconds kumar shakes his head pissed off
he takes out his wallet and hands all his cash to the hippie asshole
laughing like a prick dumbass
suddenly christy and clarissa two gorgeous twins blonde blue eyes big breasts british accents approach carrying take out bags
they see kumar and the hippie asshole making their deal
hey you guys about to smoke
kumar and hippie asshole turn and see the twins
theyre both floored by their hotness
to the twins yeah
wanna come back to my place
like they want to go listen to a bunch of phish records while you read your lame ass poetry
kumar contd to the twins showing his bag of weed ladies
wanna get high and have some fun
christy and clarissa look at each other
they like this dude
butting in hey my poetry isnt lame
its actually quite good
the girls clearly arent convinced
the ignore him and turn to kumar
hippie asshole is oblivious to the fact hes not part of the crowd
re bag of food were just gonna eat before this gets cold
what do you say we meet you back in our room in twenty minutes

ill see you later
yeah see you there
the twins walk away
hippie asshole tries to pound fists with kumar like theyre all of a sudden friends
kumar snubs him and runs off
not cool man
kumar runs down the hall and finds harold walking with cindy and the asian students
he runs over to them
you gotta come quick
there are these two filthy pussies who are just aching to get boned by us
kumar notices that cindy is appalled by his choice of words
there are two very lovely young pussies who would like to have a chat with you and i
harolds coming with us
hes coming with me
isnt that right rold
cindy gives harold an evil eye hes intimidated by her
to kumar lets go to the party for a little while
kumar notices an open dorm room nearby
he enters the room and returns a few moments later dragging an asian freshman in his pajamas
he pushes the asian freshman over to cindy
here this is harolds understudy
you can do whatever you want with him
to harold lets go
kumar grabs harold by the arm and drags him away
cindy looks pissed as she watches harold being taken away from her
kumar takes the first puff of a joint
i cant believe you were gonna ditch me for the joy luck club
you know what their parties are like
look what do you want me to say
i was under pressure
just say no
thats all it takes
now take a hit of this
kumar hands harold the joint
suddenly a nearby door opens and a security guard enters the hall
he sees harold and kumar with drugs
hey what are you two doing
harold and kumar start running down the hallway
hey get back here
harold and kumar duck around the corner
they see a door to the womens bathroom
the guys rush into the womens bathroom
harold and kumar try to decide where to hide
what if he finds us
dude chill out
hes not gonna look for us in the womens bathroom
harold and kumar hear two female voices outside the bathroom
get in that stall
theres a line of three bathroom stalls on one wall
harold runs into stall number two the middle one
kumar sees the bathroom door start to open
he also runs into stall number two and shuts the door behind him
the guys struggle to stand on the toilet bowl
harolds laptop bag keeps smacking kumar
christy and clarissa the twins enter the bathroom
theyre in mid conversation
hurry up i want to go smoke pot with that cute indian bloke
in stall number two kumars ears perk up as we see harold and kumar both standing on the toilet bowl
from kumars pov he sees christy and clarissa through the crack of the door
itll be a few minutes im about to have the worst case of the taco shits
kumar is clearly upset to hear this
clarissa runs into stall number one and shuts the door
the sound of the door shutting causes harold and kumar to look over at that stall
now i think i have to go
christy enters stall number three and shuts the door
the sound of the door shutting causes harold and kumar to turn their attention to the other stall
they then look at each other grossed out
from above we see harold and kumar struggling while the girls have taken their places in the surrounding stalls
harold and kumar look horrified
there is silence for a few seconds until
do you wanna play battle shits
we see harold quizzically mouth battle shits
oh my god
we havent played that since back in camp
harold and kumar look confused
wait for it
wait for it
harold and kumar look terrified
meanwhile cindy has left the other students and is roaming the hallways looking for harold
she sees hippie asshole walking by counting kumars money
have you seen a korean guy around here
theres like two hundred of them in this dorm
to himself but audible tard
cindy cant help but feel a little stupid
we hear the sound of diarrhea splattering against the bowl
we see harold dry heave
we hear the sound of diarrhea hitting the bowl again
you sank my destroyer
kumar almost pukes as he drops the pot into the toilet bowl
with that harold runs out of the stall and exits the bathroom
the girls look shocked
who was that
kumar looks nervous
he quickly bolts from the bathroom
christy are you still here
we hear a super loud fart
christy starts laughing
you sank my battle shit
harold and kumar run down the dorm hallway grossed out
as they run they suddenly see harold and kumar stop in their tracks when they see the east asian students association party in full blast
all the nerdy asian kids from cindys room are grinding with each other as kenneth raps a filthy rap
harold and kumar look at each other in shock
some of the dancing asian chicks look pretty hot
kenneth jumps off the couch he was standing on holding a big bag of pot brownies
pot brownies for everyone
kenneth throws some pot brownies in the air
people grab at them
harold and kumar cant believe it
two cute asian chicks approach kenneth
hey k dog
can we have some brownies
to tell you the truth im running low
but a quick titty flash may persuade me
the korean chicks look at each other
they lift up their shirts and bras revealing their boobs
dude im starting to think you made a mistake by not going to this party
harold gives him a dirty look
then suddenly the security guard from before appears in the hallway with another hey you
the guys turn and see the guards running at them
harold and further down the hall they pass the party
the partygoers watch as the guys run by except for kenneth who makes a quick grab at one of the topless girls boobs
when she notices kenneth quickly looks away as if he did nothing
cindy kim notices harold
they keep running past the bathrooms where christy and clarissa exit
they continue running
the guards are still running after harold and kumar who see the exit doors just ahead
suddenly the hippie asshole walks by blocking their path
to himself where the hell is man
harold is about to avoid him but kumar grabs harold close and the two of them bash into the hippie asshole knocking harold and kumar burst out the doors and
exit the dorm
the security guards run by the hippie asshole but stop when they see his backpack which is half open and is exposing the giant bag of weed
the security guard picks it up
well well well
what have we here
reaching for the bag aw dude
dont take it
he continues to protest as security guard holds him down
harolds car races down a road in the middle of a forest
kumar is pissed off as he drives
using his fingers i cant believe it
we were this close to getting high and getting laid
oh come on you always exaggerate
we werent gonna get laid
hey the diarrhea twins wouldve had sex with us
and what about cindy
she was looking hot tonight
the fact that youre not into her just might make you gay
i know cindys cute its just
youd rather have maria
from harolds reaction its clear he hit it on the head
look it doesnt matter
im gonna end up with cindy anyway
its just more practical
now can we drop this and get our asses to white castle
suddenly kumar pulls the car over to the side of the road
now what are you doing
daddy needs to urinate
harold rolls his eyes
kumar gets out of the car leaving the car door open
he walks onto the grass near the road for about fifteen yards until he finds a nice bush
he unzips his pants and starts oh yes
yes thats nice
as he types a raccoon jumps into the car and crawls into the back seat
harold doesnt see this
kumar is still peeing
suddenly a creepy guy from out of nowhere walks over to him
the creepy guy unzips his pants and starts urinating in the same bush right next to kumar
kumar looks at the creepy guy totally confused
the creepy guy simply goes about his business
its clear that kumar wants to say something
he remains silent for a couple seconds until he cant take it anymore
im sorry i just have to ask you
why are you peeing here
what do you mean
why did you decide to piss here right next to me
why not that bush over there
well this looked like a good bush to pee on
whyd you choose this bush
nobody was here when i chose this bush
getting heated so you can pee here and nobody else can is that it
i was just saying
is this like your special bush or something
no i just
beat you know what
forget about it
im not in the mood to get stabbed right now
the creepy guy calms down
he and kumar silently urinate next to each other for about ten seconds until the creepy guy subtly looks at kumars package
kumar gets into the car and shuts the door
he hits the gas and continues driving down the dark road
do you even know where youre going
ill be honest im a little lost
but dont worry
once we get on the highway well be there soon
it starts to rain
shit now its raining
whats the big deal
look im completely on edge right now okay
after all the shit weve been through tonight i dont know how much more of this i can take
kumar turns and sees the raccoon on harold
harold tries to pry the raccoon away from his neck
kumar tries to help him
we see harolds infiniti swerving back and forth
harold finally gets the raccoon off of him
he holds it as far away from his face as possible
the raccoons arms and legs are scurrying around trying to escape
how the hell did that get in here
it bit my neck
i probably have rabies now or something
looking at harolds neck dont worry
he didnt even break your skin
youll be fine
oh thats not good
dude get that fucking cancer raccoon away from me
kumar looks back onto the road where he sees a pair of shit
kumar quickly hits the brakes as does the other car
harold and kumar look at each other breathing heavily
they watch nervously as the other driver exits his car and begins walking over to them
kumar rolls down his window
the driver peers inside
what the hell do you think you were doing
you almost killed us
goldstein sees that its harold and kumar
harold breathes a sigh of relief
to his car dude its rold and kumar
rosenberg gets out of the car and walks over
harold and kumar get out of their car
the four of them stand in the middle of the road
what the hell are you guys doing here
we got the munchies so were out trying to find a hot dog heaven
what about you guys
how was white castle
feeling his neck we havent gotten there yet
i think i got rabies though
to goldstein ignoring harold dude how were katie holmes tits
you know the holocaust

apologize to hashem
who the hell is
okay im sorry
to goldstein you really need to meet a girl
to goldstein well if you have the yellow fever tonight theres a rocking asian party over at princeton tonight
man i have the yellow plague
theres nothing sexier than a hot asian chick
or dude for that matter
goldstein starts moving towards harold and reaches out to grab his cock
harold quickly backs away
reaching for cock come on let me suck it
let me see it and suck on it
come on rold lets rub our dicks together
harold backs away as the other three laugh
will you stop it
im feeling very woozy
i may have to go to the hospital
dude you dont have rabies
were not going to the hospital
to rosenberg yo we gotta hit this asian party
no more detours
lets just stick with the plan and get to krispee kreme
to harold and kumar you guys wouldnt believe some of the weird shit weve been through the last couple hours
harold and kumar look at each other if they only knew
kumar is sitting in the waiting room
he hides his head in a jittery manner as if hes hiding from someone
next to him are daniel and shankar who are both badly beaten and nursing their wounds
they all make eye contact
harold enters the room with a band aid on his neck
i dont have rabies
kumar stands up quickly
great lets get out of here
just as harold and kumar walk down the hallway to the exit
kumar know that voice all too well
kumar turns around and sees his father standing next to his brother saikat a nerdy looking indian guy with glasses five years older than kumar
both are in doctor attire
oh now i see why you didnt want to come to the hospital
kumar gives harold an annoyed look as his dad approaches
thick accent i hope you are here to apologize for what you did in your interview today
woodruff is a very good friend of mine and lets just say he was not at all amused by your antics
and neither am i
no accent what the hells wrong with you kumar
look at me
i own my own house
i drive a beamer
and i get laid whenever i want
you can have all that too if youd just get off your ass and go to med school
eat my balls saikat
god youre years old already
when are you gonna grow up and stop with this post college rebel bullshit
like your life is so tough
kumar doesnt have a response
i will not tolerate this business from you any longer
you have one more interview tomorrow and it is the last one im setting up for you
kumars father contd if i hear from dr
wein that you were anything short of spectacular ill completely cut you off
oh come on dad
daddy will not be coming on anything
you will be there and you will behave
ive put too much time and effort into you to let you go and fuck it all up
kumar lowers his head
hes been put in his place
kumar gives his father a hug
he even gives saikat a hug
it wont happen again
ill speak with you tomorrow
kumars father gives kumar a quick kiss on the head then he and saikat walk away
harold is stunned
so i guess youre going to med school after all huh
like i care what my dad thinks
i cant wait to see the look on his face when he finds out i skipped the interview tomorrow
he wants to cut me off
i dont need his money
extremely confused but
you just hugged him
i just needed to get my hands on these
kumar holds up saikat and his fathers scan cards
two words medical marijuana
harold shakes his head in disgust
using the scan cards harold and kumar walk into a room where there are loads of medical supplies including scrubs
kumar grabs a couple and hands one to harold
they put them on
look im telling you they see an indian and asian guy wearing these and theyll just assume were doctors
then we walk right into the pharmacy and get the weed
harold does not appear happy hes doing this
harold and kumar now wearing blue jackets and doctors masks walk out of the lounge and head down the hallway
if we get caught youre taking the blame
this wasnt my idea
were not gonna get caught
were gonna get toasted and then were gonna eat delicious white castle just like we planned
all of a sudden a hand grabs kumar from behind
freaked out they turn around and see a male nurse frazzled touchy feely
patel thank god i found you
i need your help immediately
the nurse drags them to a nearby emergency room
the scene is very fast paced with several young medical technicians rushing around
harold is confused and concerned as the nurse leads he and kumar over towards a patient
whispering to kumar what the hells going on here
he must think im saikat
leave the talking up to me
on the operating table is a patient bleeding from his chest
he is conscious and appears to be in a lot of pain
the patient was brought in by ems five minutes ago
he has three gunshot wounds with entry in the anterior abdomen
no exit wounds
harold sees blood squirt out of the patients chest
this guys gonna die
its a good thing i found you two
all the other surgeons are working on other patients
the nurse hands harold a surgical instrument
you see you got this all wrong
were not doc
kumar interrupts before harold can tell her the truth
lee is trying to say is that we need to sedate the patient first or else he could go into cardiac arrest
harold looks at kumar confused and nervous
ill get the anesthesiologist
the nurse is about to rush away but kumar stops him
what we should probably use is marijuana
thatll sufficiently sedate the patient for surgery
we dont have time for questions
we need marijuana now
get as much of it as possible
like a big bag of it
kumar shows the amount he wants with his hands
but doctor we dont have marijuana in this hospital
harold gives kumar a dirty look
to himself shit
suddenly more blood squirts from the patients chest
harold shouts in disgust making the patient more nervous
were losing him
you gotta do something
disappointed very well
i guess well have to do this the old fashioned way
kumar puts a nitrous oxide mask over the patients face
harold gives kumar a look what the fuck are you doing
first we need to clear his c spine
i want stat x rays of the chest and abdomen
give me two large bore ivs and start a ringers lactate push
nurse we need units of o neg on board
using the surgical equipment kumar actually begins removing bullets from the bleeding patient
harold cant believe whats going on
suddenly the patient begins having trouble breathing
hes gasping for air
the beeping sound monitoring his heart rate begins speeding up to an insane pace
the patient is desatting
kumar quickly examines the patients chest
ah i see
the patients got a collapsed lung
get me a gage angiocath stat
after a couple seconds go by
whats taking so long
the nurse hands kumar what is essentially a large needle
kumar directs the needle in the direction of the patients chest
its a tense moment
the patient is scared
so is harold
the nurse looks hopeful
kumar looks determined
with a quick thrust kumar jabs the needle into the patients chest causing a rush of air
the patient breathes easier
his heart rate drops back to normal
great catch doctor
his sat is up to
kumar is cool and collected
he turns to the young medical technicians who have been aiding the surgery
casual will one of you guys put the chest tube in and wrap this up
a chorus of yes doctors
taking off his gloves well it looks like my work here is done
kumar pulls the gas mask from the patients face up to his face and takes a deep breath getting a big hit of nitrous
he then leans down to the bleeding patient who is just barely conscious but seems in good spirits
say you wouldnt happen to know the quickest way to get to the white castle in cherry hill from here do you
harolds car is cruising down some streets lined with stores
harold is very excited
kumar is proud of himself but playing it cool
im telling you
that was amazing
even your dad wouldve been impressed
it wasnt bad
this is perfect
were back on the road
we have directions now
the rain let up
and guess what
harold clicks on the save option on his laptop
im officially done with my work
beat im telling you things are finally starting to go our way
while theyre stopped at a red light kumar takes in his surroundings and notices something
hey check it out
your movies playing
outside to kumars left on the marquee of a movie theater we see john hughes retrospective
and look who went to see it
harold looks at the crowd leaving the theater and sees maria standing outside all by herself
he cant believe it
you thought you two had nothing in common
but it turns out you both have the same lame taste in movies
hey you wanna see if she wants to come with us to white castle
forget about it
kumar puts his hands on harolds shoulders to get his undivided attention
its one in the morning
were an hour from home
and who do we see but your dream girl standing outside a theater playing your favorite movie
i mean if we were in a cheesy romantic comedy and i was your annoying gay friend this would be the moment id tell you this is a sign
just pretend youre a nerdy asian tom hanks and shes a hot latina meg ryan
with bigger tits
besides you yourself said things are starting to go our way
lets just go
kumar presses a button causing harolds window to go down
what are you doing
calling out hey maria
maria looks up
harold quickly ducks in his seat
he then hey get your hand off the gas
kumar tries kicking harolds hand off the gas
just then looking up oh shit
harolds infiniti has driven off the road and is speeding kumar grabs control of the wheel and tries to steer the car safely
harold is bumping around on the way down the hill
finally they reach the bottom of the hill near a dirt road
my cars probably all scratched up now
dont blame me
youre the one who ran us off the road
i told you i didnt want to speak to her
composing himself whatever
lets jut get back on the highway
kumar presses the gas
suddenly we hear a pop
harold and kumar look at each other angry and frustrated
harold examines the flat tire
kumar is standing nearby
theres not another car in site
you know how to change a flat
only hicks and italian guys know how to change a tire
harold looks in his trunk for the spare
wheres my spare tire
i dont know
shit where the hell is it
kumar suddenly remembers
dont you remember that time we got baked and started throwing shit off that bridge to see if it would float
what the hell are you talking about
realizing oh shit
i was with goldstein
we borrowed your car that day
what are the hell are we gonna do now
suddenly they see an old pick up truck driving in their direction
harold and kumar wave it down
the truck stops in front of them
the door opens and a shadowy figure begins walking towards them
harold and kumar are nervous
as soon as the figure reaches them lightening strikes
its the ugliest man of all time hes in his fifties wearing a crappy mesh cap but most notably he has large bumps and boils all over his face
harold and kumar jump back in fear as they catch their first glimpse of him
you boys need some help
the ugly man takes off his mesh cap
even his haircut is freaky
he has a skullet a mullet but with no hair on top
harold and kumar look at each other freaked out
the ugly mans truck tows harolds infiniti down a dirt road
the ugly man is driving
kumar is in the front seat on the passenger side
harold is sandwiched between them
thanks for helping us out
no problem at all
saw you boys stranded there and thought to myself what would jesus do
harold and kumar look at each other
they then notice a jesus christ bobble head doll on the dashboard
so you boys worship christ
the guys look at each other again not sure how to respond
sure hes great
good to hear it
the names randy
but everyone calls me freak show
this is harold
good to meet you mr
pleasures all mine
after a while harold starts to notice that theyre driving in the middle of a dark woods
it looks very sketchy
so where exactly are we going
my place isnt too far from here
once we get there ill have your ride fixed up in a jiffy
the guys silently continue driving until kumar notices a whispering to harold eww check out those boils on his neck
harold nudges him to be quiet
kumar looks back over at freak show and sees that one of the boils is pulsating
whispering oh my god
you gotta look
one of thems actually pulsating
whispering will you shut up
hes right next to me
he can hear you
kumar sees that a white puss is now oozing from the boil
whispering now theres some sort of puss
its the most disgusting thing ive ever seen
whispering whats the matter with you
you think that just because youre whispering he cant hear what youre saying
hes two feet away from us
he can hear this entire conversation
he can hear me talking right now
whispering dont worry he cant hear anything
not with all that crust in his ear
harold gives kumar a hard elbow to the stomach
he then looks nervously at freak show who doesnt seem to have heard a thing
harold seems relieved
i heard every word you said
freak show doesnt say anything else
harold and kumar dont know how to react
they feel really uncomfortable
the fact that nothing happens makes it all the more awkward for them
harold with laptop in tow and kumar stand by their car as freak show brings out some tools and a new tire from his house which is run down and
in the middle of nowhere
now its gonna take me a little while here so if you boys like you can go inside wash up fuck my wife have something to drink watch tv anything
mi casa es su casa
just dont do anything jesus wouldnt do
freak show gives harold a pat on the back and starts changing the tire
kumar and harold look at each other
slowly they walk towards freak shows house
am i deaf or did he just say we can fuck his wife
he couldnt have said that
but he did
it may have been in mid sentence but it was still clear as day
they reach the front door and are about to enter
youve seen freak show
what do you think his wife is gonna look like
harold and kumar walk inside and see the hottest chick of all time liane walk out of the kitchen
she is dressed daisy dukes and a tight skimpy shirt that accentuates her chest
im freak shows wife liane
would you boys like some pink lemonade
harold and kumar cant move
let me go bring in a pitcher
liane leaves to go into the kitchen
along the way she turns on a record player which starts playing a creepy song about jesus christ
harold and kumar look around the house
there are crosses and bible verses on the walls along with freak show and lianes wedding picture
weve entered the twilight zone
dude liane is fucking hot
shes not ugly
liane comes in with the pitcher of lemonade
she pours them drinks and hands them the glasses
beat so tell me liane how are things between you and freak show presently
oh never been better
we love each other very much
kumar looks disappointed
harold however is intrigued
can i ask how does a guy
like freak show
end up with a woman like yourself
well i met him at choir practice bout four years ago
freak show was very shy back then you know because of all the hideous boils on his face and neck
but he had the most amazing voice like a baby canary
harold and kumar look at each other in disbelief are we talking about the same freakshow
well one day after easter service i told him how much i enjoyed his solo and he just mustered up some courage and asked me out
the rest is history
and weve been in love ever since
harold ponders this for a moment
he and kumar begin drinking their lemonade
so you boys gonna fuck me or what
harold and kumar spit the lemonade out simultaneously
they look at each other in complete shock
kumar turns to harold
rock paper scissors to see who goes first
wait a second what about freak show
and this whole christian thing you guys have going on
a little offended oh so just because were passionate about our lord you assume we dont know how to have a good time
no i just
liane starts playing with the knot in her shirt
harold and kumar stare unabashedly
harold looks outside the window where he sees freak show changing the tire apparently busy
to kumar swinging his hand okay rock paper scissors
sorry if you boys want me you gotta do me at the same time
give me the double stuff
harold and kumar look at each other confused
im not sure we quite understand
i want you both inside me simultaneously
harold and kumar look at each other again more confused and kind of disturbed
kumar turns to liane
um are we talking about one hole or two
however you want to do it
sorry no thank you
to harold shh
two holes it might not be that bad
beat shotgun anus
i dont want our balls rubbing against each other
kumar turns to liane in desperation
what about blow jobs
can we get blow jobs
to harold can you help me with this
liane walks over to harold seductively
harold is nervous and doesnt know what he should do
she takes his hand and puts it on the knot in her shirt
harold looks over to kumar who gives him a reassuring nod
harold then pulls on the cloth causing the knot to come loose thereby releasing her shirt
the shirt is now hanging and just barely covering her breasts
to harold re breasts do you want to play with them
harold looks over to kumar then back at liane
okay lets do that
liane takes harolds hands and places them on her breasts
kumar looks on enviously
liane moans in pleasure as harold starts to massage her chest
at that moment freak show enters the room holding a particularly threatening tire iron
hey boys i changed your tire
freak show sees harold with liane
what the hell are you doing with my wife
scared shitless uhh
you said outside that we can have sex with her
freak show runs over to harold and grabs him by the collar
i most certainly did not say that
we both heard you
calming down are you sure
freak show ponders this
my mistake then
well since were all here why not make it a foursome
who wants the first reach around
harold and kumar burst out the front door and run towards their car
they get in and peel out as fast as they can
harolds infiniti is driving down a dusty trail in the woods
okay lets agree never to talk about what just happened
kumar searches for some clue of where they are
dude i have no idea where we are
all of a sudden a hitchhiker waves them down up ahead
hey a hitchhiker
should we pick him up
and get chopped to bits
are you crazy
kumar pulls over to the side of the road
oh calm down
he may know how to get us back on the highway
its my car
were not picking up a hitchhiker
the back door opens and neil hitchhiker gets into the car
yo man thanks for picking me up
harold and kumar look at neil and then look at each other
they are in complete shock
harold is no longer angry
to neil uh
excuse me but
are you neil patrick harris
holy shit dude
doogie howser m

curt hey thats great

dude i humped every piece of ass ever on that show
even the chick who played the hot nurse
no i didnt go all the way with her
hey you dont know how to get back on the highway do you
i dont even know where the fuck i am right now
i was at this party earlier tonight and this dude hooked me up with some killer x
somehow i ended up getting thrown out of a moving car and ive been tripping balls ever since
harold and kumar both find this to be quite strange
well our nights been pretty crazy too
weve been driving around for hours trying to get to white castle but we keep getting sidetracked
dude forget white castle
what we need is some pussy

lets get us some poon tang
then well go to white castle
you dont understand neil

neil contd lets pick up some trim at a strip club
the doogie line always works on strippers
harold and kumar look at each other weirded out
hey theres a gas station
lets stop and get directions
kumar quickly makes a turn onto a normal looking street leading up to a gas station in the distance
harold and kumar get out of the car
neil is still in the backseat
the car is still running
well be right back neil
neil shakes his head disappointed
harold and kumar start walking over to the convenience store
whats the deal with neil patrick harris
whys he so horny
i dont know
but we cant let him interfere with our quest
suddenly coles yellow jeep drives right by them
they have to jump out of the way
cole parks the jeep and exits with late night math league meeting homos
to cole extreme
upset oh shit
cole and the two punks push past harold and kumar and walk into the store
harold and kumar enter after them
harold and kumar walk into the store where they see cole and the punks are nonchalantly knocking over random items from the shelves
they then begin playing hackeysack with a hostess like pie
the cashier an old indian man in his sixties throws out a couple indecipherable protests
to cole and the punks please
cole and the punks ignore him
harold and kumar then approach the indian cashier
excuse me can you tell us how to get onto the highway from here
the indian cashier shrugs his shoulders
to harold he probably cant speak english
kumar listens as the cashier tells him the directions in hindi it takes the cashier a long time to explain it
he mentions numerous streets and routes
it sounds like its very complicated
meanwhile while they are talking harold suddenly sees two more extreme sports punks enter the store carrying a kayak and a paddle
they carry the kayak to the back of the store
harold has no idea what the hell is going on
kumar and the cashier are too busy talking to notice
harold watches nervously as cole puts on a helmet and gets into the kayak
who knew that learning hindi would actually pay off
the guy says the highways just down the road
we should be in cherry hill in ten minutes
harold is still focused on cole and the extreme punks
to kumar huh
harold kumar and the indian cashier immediately turn and look at cole who is in the kayak which is being held up by in slow motion we see cole swing
his paddle around in mid air knocking over everything on the shelves bags of chips the extreme sports punks cheer cole on while harold kumar and the indian cashier watch in disbelief
the kayak lands on the floor
cole gets out and celebrates with his friends
that was so fucking extreme man
yeah man on a scale from one to ten one being not so extreme ten being extremely extreme id give it a nine point five
meanwhile all the extreme sports punks begin going crazy throughout the store knocking food off the shelves bothering other customers
the indian cashier begins yelling at them in hindi
extreme sports punk casually looks through a shelf of various kinds of snack chips discarding them one after an other
finally he stumbles upon extreme cheddar doritos
he goes apeshit over his find
he tears open the bag and starts pouring them into his mouth getting the chips all over the place
the indian cashier is still yelling
cole picks up the cashier
harold and kumar watch on as cole spins the indian cashier around and around
somebody should do something
to cole hey asshole
why dont you leave the guy alone and go jerk off to some snowboarding videos or something
pissed cole stops in his tracks and drops the cashier on the floor
its clear to harold that they may get their asses kicked
to kumar i didnt mean you should do something
cole slowly walks over to kumar
the two stand face to face
cole looks pissed but kumar keeps his confident exterior
its a tense moment
suddenly cole makes a quick motion as if he was going to hit kumar trying to get him to flinch
kumar stands his ground without flinching still looking cole in the eye
the punks dont know what to think as their leader is shown up
seemingly impressed by kumar cole begins to turn around as if hes going to walk away but he quickly doubles back doing the same fake punch he did before
caught off guard this time kumar flinches like a nervous weakling
pissed off at himself shit
cole and the punks burst out laughing
yeah thats right bitch
try fucking with me one more time
just try it
cole jumps up and town gloating and pounding on his chest
to kumar embarrassed come on lets get out of here
harold and kumar walk out of the store deflated
with their leader victorious the punks begin celebrating
like apu thank you come again
harold and kumar walk back towards their car
kumar you okay
yeah i just hate those dicks
beat fuck it
at least now we know where were going
im so friggin hungry
harold and kumar stand there for fifteen seconds without saying a word as they watch the car slowly disappear in the distance
eventually harold breaks the silence
calm did doogie howser just steal my fucking car
i think he did
to kumar you
you had to pick up a hitchhiker
rold calm down
why the hell did you leave the keys in the car
i figured that neil patrick harris was a trustworthy guy
how was i supposed to know that hed fuck us over
this is all your fault
this whole fucking night
you know i leased that car
theyre gonna make me pay for it
harold starts to walk back to the convenience store
where are you going
im going to call the police
i dont want to talk to you anymore
harold is about to walk in when he sees cole wind up and throw a hostess like snowball right in the cashiers face
extremes all around
theres a pay phone across the street if you dont want to deal with those assholes
harold turns around and walks back towards the street
kumar walks with him keeping his distance
they reach the street
on the other side he sees an orange dont walk sign lit up
harold presses the walk button on the post next to him
so after you talk to the cops were still going to white castle right
im not speaking to you
harold waits for the dont walk sign to change
he starts pressing the walk button repeatedly
you know pressing the button a bunch of times doesnt make the sign change any faster
the computer responds to the first press
every press after that is extraneous
thank you mr
harold waits for a few seconds but when the light doesnt change he begins pressing the button again
when are they gonna fucking develop button technology thatll understand urgency
the dont walk sign still wont change
kumar looks to the left and then to the right
the street is completely empty and there is no place for a police car to hide
this is ridiculous
just walk across
itll change in a second
they stand there for another ten seconds
it doesnt change
come on theres not a car in sight
you want me to cross
just leave me alone
harold starts walking angrily across the street
before kumar has a chance to follow a police car from out of shit
harold walks back over to kumar clearly upset within him as officer palumbo s good looking tough gets out of the car and walks over to them
looking at cops name tag good evening
is there a problem officer
is there a problem
ever hear of jaywalking
yes i have
im so sorry
i promise ill never do it again
yeah like i give a fuck
im writing you up a ticket
officer palumbo begins writing a ticket
kumar walks over flabbergasted
are you serious
harold motions kumar to shut the fuck up
to kumar unthreatened who the fuck are you shitwad
stepping in front of kumar let me apologize for my friend
i promise i will pay the fine
but actually im glad youre here
you know the tv show doogie howser m
you see doogie howser just stole my car and
pipe down and give me your id
to officer palumbo wait
kumar contd how can you give him a ticket for jaywalking
i mean look at this street
he wasnt causing traffic or anything
kumar shut up
to kumar yeah thats not the best tone to use on a cop who could bust your ass
bust my ass
yeah koo mar
bust your ass
to harold whats with that name koo mar with like three os and shit
what happened to good old fashioned american names like dave jim
harold points to his id
harold is starting to pacify palumbo
thats a great name
you should be proud of that name son
officer palumbo hands harold his ticket and begins to walk away
as you were ladies
kumar grabs the ticket from harold and looks at it
are you crazy
palumbo quickly turns around and returns to the guys
kumar i swear to god if you dont
to officer palumbo no no no
i understand whats going on
harold steps in front of kumar and puts his arms up to block him
palumbo interprets the movement as a hostile movement towards him
hey hands down
no sudden moves
harold puts his hands down and kumar continues his rant with palumbo improvising little responses
let me guess
you were probably the big asshole in your high school right
youd pick on guys like us every day
but then graduation came and we went to college and you went nowhere so you thought how can i still give them shit
ill become a cop
your dreams come true
both officer palumbo and harold are getting really pissed
kumar steps in front of harold and offers his friend over to palumbo
to officer palumbo hey while youre at it why dont you write him up another ticket
or better yet arrest him
lock him up
with that harold takes a big swing at kumar
kumar sees harolds fist coming and quickly ducks
harolds fist ends up hitting officer palumbo in the face
the cell door slams
harold is behind bars
calling out hey are you gonna do something about my car
palumbo is in the main office area dealing with hippie asshole and his mom
the mom hands officer palumbo a check
your donation to our police charity is very appreciated
well thank you for being so understanding about bradley
i promise you he wont ever do it again
oh im sure he wont
not after the talk we had right brad
officer palumbo gives hippie asshole a threatening look
shaken mom please take me home
the mom leaves with hippie asshole clinging to her like a frightened child
palumbo shakes his head and sits down at his desk where we see hippie assholes big bag of weed along with harolds wallet and laptop
he then starts filing a report on harold
harold looks at officer palumbo through the bars
can i at least give you my cars licence plate number
ignoring harold palumbo turns up the volume on his radio
the search for the escaped cheetah continues tonight
it was last spotted in randolph township heading south
harold turns around and examines his cell
inside with him is a black man tarik sitting down reading a book
harold sits down across from tarik
while harold isnt looking we see officer palumbo take the cash out of harolds wallet and pocket it
so what are you in here for
for being black
tarik sits up
he looks at officer palumbo who with his walkman on is oblivious to their conversation
i am serious
you wanna know what happened
i was walking out of a barnes and noble and a cop stops me
evidently a black man robbed a store in newark
therefore since im black it was probably me right
harold shrugs his shoulders
well that was the logic the cop used
i told him i havent even been to newark in months
then he pointed a gun at me and told me to stop resisting arrest
i said hey im not resisting anything
so he starts beating me with his gun screaming at me telling me to stop resisting
what did you do
i kept saying i understand that im under arrest
please stop beating me
but that didnt work
then another cop showed up
when it was all said and done it took nine cops to bring me in here
that fucking blows
tarik nods and continues reading his book
harold sees that tarik is remarkably relaxed
i dont understand how youre able to be so calm about all this
son im fat
i cant dance
and i have two gay fathers
ive had people messing with me my whole life
beat i learned a long time ago theres no point in getting all riled up every time a bunchy of idiots gives you a hard time
because in the end the universe tends to unfold as it should
harold takes this all in
so what are you in here for
assaulting an officer
they tried to pin that shit on you too
i actually did hit the cop
but only because i was trying to hit my friend
well ex friend
suddenly officer reilly hangs up the phone on his desk
he shouts out to the other officers in the room hey listen up guys
multiple gun shots fired in millbrook park
it sounds bad
finally some action
another cop officer martone gets up
no im going
all six officers in the room jump out of their desks and run for the door
harold and tarik cant believe it
we see the officers get into their police cars and drive off
harold and tarik are now left all alone in their cell
that was strange
suddenly a loud banging sound is made from a ventilation shaft on the ceiling above one of the officers desks
what the hell was that
from inside the shaft rold
is that you
although his voice is muffled we can hear kumars words
tarik is very confused
shouting out kumar
what the fuck are you doing
are the cops still there
wait a second did you
i called and made up some story about a shooting in millbrook park
what did you do that for
im fucking starving
i figured id bust you out and wed get over to white castle
i dont want to get in any more trouble
im already in here because of you
hey fuck you
what did you want me to do
stand there and take the hit
you know ive never taken a swing at you before
well i never got your car stolen
hey im trying to read here
look rold im sorry
but youre not the only one dealing with shit
my dads cutting me off remember
hey asshole im in jail
dont bitch to me about your problems
just leave me alone
i dont want your help
you dont want my help
im outta here
we hear a couple banging sounds from the ventilation shaft
then a couple more
then a couple more
pouting harold pretends to ignore it
how do i get out of here
tarik rolls his eyes in disbelief
how the hell should i know
this isnt good
we hear the banging noise again
suddenly the jesus christ
tarik shakes his head
kumar gets up and walks over to the cell
you sure you dont want to get out
and become a fugitive
are you nuts
the guy has all my information
harold points to palumbos desk which has the police report harolds i
and his laptop
well take everything he wrote down about you and leave
beat unless you want to stay here all night and not be able to hand your work in tomorrow
harold thinks about this for a second
he begins searching for a key
we see all the police cars returning to the station
kumar finds a big metal key ring on palumbos desk
i was hoping it would be one of these big ring of keys
now i get to try all of them to see which one will
kumar hurry the fuck up
kumar runs over to the cell door
he tries out a couple keys when he suddenly smells something
whats that smell
kumar turns his head and sees the enormous bag of weed on officer reillys desk
kumar cant hear harold
hes in a trance
we begin to hear a romantic song as kumar stares lovingly at the bag of weed
its a beautiful sunny day in the park as kumar pushes the bag of weed on a swing like young lovers do in movies
kumar has his arms around the bag of weed as he helps it swing the golf club
its a hole in one
kumar turns the kumar and the bag of weed are sitting down posing for a caricature sketch artist
the artist reveals his sketch to kumar and the bag of weed
it obviously looks ridiculous
the bag of weed is lying on kumars bed while kumar gives it a massage
kumar is lying on the bed while the bag of weed is giving him a massage yes the bag has little arms and hands now
the bag of weed is holding a box containing pictures and memorabilia of its relationship to the hippie asshole
the bag of weed throws the box in a garbage can
kumar lights a match and throws it in the can setting it aflame
he and the bag of weed face each other and kiss
a naked kumar and the bag of weed are kissing in bed
the bag of weed starts to go under the covers
we watch as the sheets move up and down
kumar starts to have an orgasm
the bag of weed comes up from under the covers
kumar gives it a kiss
then he goes under the covers
we see the bag kumar wearing a wife beater undershirt and boxers is frustrated as he looks at his bills
the bag of weed wearing a pink bathrobe comes out of the kitchen holding a mug of kumar hears the bag of weed crying from the other room
he obviously feels guilty
kumar walks away from the cell goes over to the desk picks up the bag of weed and caresses it
what the hell are you
suddenly all six police officer come back into the room pushing a black man wearing pajamas nathaniel banks
nathaniel seems very gentle
hes even wearing a turtleneck sweater
to nathaniel you thought you could get away with this huh
where am i
i was in bed
i didnt fire any gun i swear
suddenly officer reilly looks over to the jail cell
all the cops turn to the cell
kumar is still holding the weed
he doesnt know what to do
harold is scared shitless
re tarik shit
jacksons trying to escape
tarik looks up from his book
oh not again
the cops handcuff nathaniel to the leg of a desk and run over to the jail cell ignoring kumar and the weed
stop trying to escape
im not trying to escape
look at me im sitting down
they turn the key that is already in the keyhole and storm into the room
harold stands back confused
tarik leans against the wall ready to be handcuffed
the cops grab him and throw him down against the bed
hes trying to break free
hold him tight
in the midst of all the action kumar grabs harold and pulls him out of the cell
harold goes over to palumbos desk and picks up his wallet and laptop along with the police report
they start running out of the room
kumars still clinging to the weed
to kumar wait shouldnt we do something about this
to harold if i were you id get out of here as soon as possible
with that harold and kumar run out
harold and kumar still clinging to the weed burst out the door and run down the steps
they race through the street and start heading towards a forest
harold and kumar have stopped running
they start catching their breath
that place was a fucking mad house
thanks for getting me out of there dude
hey man the burgers wouldnt taste as good if you werent there
beat re weed dude look at this
its like we went from being broke to being millionaires
suddenly they hear what sounds like a coyotes howl
what was that
just a coyote
arent people supposed to be scared of coyotes
thats only because they sound scary
in one on one combat either one of us can take a coyote down
now cheetahs theyre another story
the cheetah stares harold and kumar down
were gonna die
just calm down
cheetahs are used to eating zebras and shit
theyre not known for eating humans
were gonna die
okay ill admit thats not a good sign
but im sure if we just stay calm hell probably leave us alone
harold and kumar stand silently
slowly the cheetah begins walking directly over to harold
whispering this isnt working
suddenly the cheetah opens his mouth wide and chomps down on eyes closed screaming harold continues screaming for the next ten seconds
eventually he calms down and looks at the cheetah
annoyed i thought i told you not to take that jerky
harold simply falls to the ground relieved that he hasnt been eaten
the cheetah walks over to harold and begins licking harolds face in friendship
he likes me
suddenly kumars eyes light up
dude i think i have an idea
what is it
ill tell you but first we have to get really high
kumar opens the bag of weed
pan up to the night sky for a time lapse
we see smoke coming up from below
pan back down
harold and kumar are now sitting on top of the cheetah smoking joints
kumar has a belt around the cheetahs neck like reigns on a horse
has it come to this
are we really gonna ride this cheetah
hey cheetahs are the fastest animals on the planet
its as good as a car
kumar takes one last drag of a joint and flicks it away
this is either a really smart move or by far the stupidest thing weve ever done
harold puts his arms around kumar to hold on
kumar puts the bag of weed under his shirt
well well soon find out
like to a snow dog mush
dude am i just really high or is this is actually working
this is great
well be at white castle in no
harold lands on the ground his head bleeding
his eyes slowly close as he goes unconscious
the land of burgers is an oz like world the entire terrain with all its rolling hills is made up of hamburgers
music plays as harold and maria skip through the land of burgers holding hands
along the way they run by
the black guys from the basketball game all waltzing with each other in white tuxedos
hugest angriest black guy gives harold the same scary look from before
freak show is shoveling some burgers from the ground into a wheelbarrow
he waves to harold and maria
he then takes out a chainsaw and starts cutting off the arm hes waving with
kumar and the male nurse who are playing twister while getting high
after a spin of the wheel kumar reluctantly gets in a position where it looks like hes taking the male nurse from behind
kumars not happy
harold and maria fall to the ground they roll down a hill until harold is on top of maria
harold picks up a burger from the ground
maria does the same
they proceed to feed each other their burgers
they munch on them looking into each others eyes
i love you harold
i love you maria
maria gets up and runs away
harold playfully chases her
maria runs over to a french fry tree
she plucks a couple wow you guys are really extreme
harold turns and sees cole kayaking down a nearby stream
extremely gay that is
harold is shocked
he turns around and sees maria holding a crossbow
she smiles at him
he then jumps on top of her oh harold
oh god you have the biggest dick of all time
its so long
and wide for that matter
suddenly harold turns and sees the burger shack employee lying down near them
he is staring at them with no expression on his face with his hand down his pants rubbing his penis furiously
harold is disturbed
dont worry about him
maria rolls over so shes on top of harold
she starts harold wakes up to find kumar licking his face
harold jumps what the hell are you doing
youve been out cold for the past half hour
i figured that maybe if i did some gay shit youd wake up
harold wipes his face with his sleeve
he then gets up he sees that they are by a random road all by themselves
what happened to the cheetah
it ran away
but forget about that
i have some bad news and some worse news
nervous tell me the worse news first
i checked out some road signs
the cheetah took us in the wrong direction
whats the bad news
your laptop is completely destroyed
kumar points to the laptop which is outside of its bag broken in pieces
it smashed against a tree when you fell off the cheetah
why the hell didnt you say that that was the worse news
well the laptop really only effects you
whereas the white castle situation effects both of us equally
dont worry dude
your laptops insured
its not that
all my work was saved in there
now i gotta go back to the office and re do everything
first well take a cab over to white castle then well
forget white castle
theres no time
come on rold
you can get that shit done in a couple hours
we cant quit now
harold and kumar stand there speechless as neil drives right past them splashing a puddle in harolds face
they stand there watching silently as neil drives off
harold is now drenched
muddy water drips from his hair and clothing
he gives kumar a dirty look
kumar knows he shouldnt push harold any further
well find a pay phone and get a cab back to your office
harold furious and almost in tears simply nods yes
kumar disappointed walks down the road with a miserable harold
when they reach the corner
pointing look theres a krispee kreme
well call from there
harold and kumar walk over to the parking lot
unfortunately they notice a familiar yellow jeep covered in stickers
here we go again
cole and the extreme sports punks are hacky sacking in the parking lot
their skateboards are sitting nearby
to kumar hey apu
kumar tries to ignore him
whos running the quik e mart while youre gone
cole pounds fists with his friends
to rold fucking asshole
suddenly harold stops in his tracks
hes noticed something through the krispee kreme window
he stops kumar and points
through the window we see rosenberg and goldstein inside sitting at a booth
they both have a dozen donuts and five cartons of milk
it looks like they just sat down
goldstein savors his first bite of his powdered blueberry filled donut and rosenberg licks his fingers after his first bite of his chocolate cream filled donut
harold and kumar watch through the window longingly
yearning i want that
a chocolate cream filled
i want that feeling
beat the feeling that comes over a man when he finally gets exactly what he desires
beat i need that feeling
are you saying what i think youre saying
we gotta go to white castle
kumar gives harold a hug
i knew you had it in you
suddenly kumar notices something else inside
someone else is sitting down at rosenberg goldsteins table
is that cindy kim
harold watches as cindy kim sits down next to goldstein
goldstein puts his arm around her and feeds her a piece of donut
it looks like goldstein and cindy are an item
you should have boned her when you had the chance
before harold can respond hes hit in the back of the head by a hacky sack
cole and the punks laugh at harold
to cole hey why dont you just leave us alone
what are you gonna do about it mr
cole gets in the crane position a la the karate kid
harold is quiet for a moment as he looks at coles little racist routine
he then lets out a little laugh
harold turns around and starts walking towards the krispee kreme entrance
in the background cole and the punks are laughing about what a pussy harold is
pissed off but powerless fuck
im so sick of their bullshit
totally calm dont worry
the universe tends to unfold as it should
kumar gives a what the fuck is he talking about
besides i have a plan
follow my lead
harold walks past the krispee kreme entrance and heads towards the yellow jeep at a brisk pace
one of the extreme sports punks sees harold doing this
cole turns to see harold in his car
kumar is about to get in the passengers side
cole and the punks start running towards the car
kumar sees this and quickly gets inside
harold puts the car in reverse nearly hitting the punks
harold is shifting gears
what the hell are you doing
im stealing their car
this is your plan
its working isnt it
harold drives the car out of the parking lot
cole and the punks give chase on their skateboards
laughing hey slow down to like mph so they think they have a chance to catch up
harold drives coles jeep down at a speed just slow enough for cole and the punks to think that they have a chance
kumar then sticks his head out the window
in thick indian accent thank you come again
harold guns it leaving cole and the punks in the dust
we see cole and the punks watching in disbelief as harold and kumar drive off with their car
dude that was so not extreme
i know extreme sports punk i know
the extreme sports punks walk away leaving cole by himself
harold and kumar are laughing and slapping five
victory is sweet
nice job roldy
i had to do something
kumar begins sniffing something in the air
do you smell that
kumar keeps sniffing
he turns around to the back seat
he reaches back and picks something up from off the floor
its a white castle bag
he pours out the contents and we see empty white castle hamburger cartons fall onto kumars lap
those assholes got to have white castle
this world is so unfair
forget about that
we have a car now
were back in the game
pretty soon well be eating our own white castle
want me to drive
ive got everything under control
we should be able to get there with enough time for me to get my work done after our feast
just find us some tunes
a tape is resting in the tape deck
kumar pushes it in
harold and kumar look at each other amazed that cole has some lame chick song on his tape
those guys are fucking posers
we see coles yellow jeep speeding along the highway
we see signs indicating theyre getting closer to cherry hill
harold and kumar are now listening to another lame chick song
while they arent fully embracing the song its clear theyre kind of enjoying it
the guys take the cherry hill exit
harold and kumar are singing along passionately to a third lame chick song
dude were almost there
theyre speeding down a road lined by forests on both sides
we see the jeep speeds by a cop car
officer brucks middle aged tough toothpick in his mouth sees the yellow jeep speed by
he reloads his rifle
harold and kumar are still singing
all of a sudden harold and kumar hear a police siren
kumar turns around and sees the police car behind them
officer brucks is speaking into his police radio
i found them
and im gonna need back up
the cop car is tailing the jeep
the jeep pulls away
officer brucks sees the jeep pull away
into police radio oh boy
we got a chase on our hands
harold looks determined as he puts the pedal to the metal
what are you doing
im not going back to jail
weve come too far
now buckle up
kumar buckles his seat belt
harold makes a sharp turn
the yellow jeep goes around a turn in the road and then cuts we then see the cop car go around the turn
it passes by the point where harold and kumar entered the forest
from officer bruckss pov we see that he has a long stretch ahead with no cars in sight
what the hell
he puts his foot on the brakes bringing the car to a screeching halt
officer brucks gets out of the car and looks around wondering where the yellow jeep went
he then hears the sound of the jeep bounces up and down as it heads uphill in the woods
harold is holding onto the wheel for dear life
kumar is scared as shit
theyre both bouncing up and down
where the hell are we going
just hold on
the jeep continues going uphill higher and higher
harold and kumar are still bouncing up and down
its a good thing i have an empty stomach or else id puke right now
were gonna make it
everythings gonna be
we see the jeep stop just short of the cliff
harold and kumar get out of the jeep and walk over to the edge of the cliff and look down
its a very steep drop
look out there
kumar notices something
kumar walks over to the jeep and points to the hang glider
not a chance
id rather turn myself in than die
dude its okay
i used to hang glide with my dad all the time when i was kid
i know how to do it
you hang glided
i dont remember that
we did it on our trips to india
i know exactly what im doing
ive even done it with two people at the same time
my brother and i did it
kumar contd just hold onto the outside bars and let me take care of the rest
im not risking my life over a bunch of hamburgers
kumar walks over to harold and stares him in the eye
you think this just about the burgers huh
well let me tell you its about far more than that
kumar walks over to the edge of the cliff and looks out onto the early morning horizon
the sun is still rising
the scene is very picturesque
our parents came to this country escaping persecution poverty and hunger
they were very very hungry
and they wanted to live in a land that treated them as equals
a land where their kids could study and get into good colleges
a land filled with hamburger stands
and not just one type of hamburger
hundreds of types with different sizes toppings and condiments
that land was america
turning to rold you think this is just about the burgers
this is about achieving what our parents set out for
this is about the pursuit of happiness
this is about the american dream
kumar walks over to harold
and so weve reached this point
the point which all men eventually have to face
the point of no return
beat we can stay here get arrested and end our hopes of ever going to white castle
or we can take the hang glider and make our leap towards freedom
i leave the decision up to you
from the sound of the sirens it seems that the police are getting closer
harold turns back facing kumar
i hate you kumar
theyre almost here
grab onto the end of the bars and hold on tight
harold does as hes told
they are both holding onto the bars harold behind kumar
heres how this is gonna work
on the count of three were gonna run to the edge of the cliff
when i say jump launch yourself forward as if you were diving into a pool got it
nervous i think so
dont worry everythings gonna be fine
are you ready
harolds too nervous to speak
kumar gets into position
okay here goes
harold and kumar start running towards the cliff
good job rold
rold theres something i gotta tell you
ive never hang glided before
the hang glider coasts through the air for a couple seconds
oh my god
oh my god
oh my god
dude its working
i cant believe you lied to me
hey how else was i gonna convince you to jump off a cliff
officer brucks gets out of the car holding his rifle and runs over to the jeep
he looks inside
to the walkie talkie it appears theyve escaped
they ditched their jeep
officer brucks opens the front door of the car and peers inside
he notices the bag of weed on the dashboard
he opens it and tastes some weed in the same way a drug cop would taste cocaine during a bust
to the walkie talkie good news
i found enough dope in the car to send those skateboard punks to jail for the next couple years
looks like theyve terrorized their last convenience store
suddenly officer brucks realizes that the taste in his mouth is strangely appealing
he thinks for a beat as he eyes the bag of weed
he then takes another taste of it
he looks again at the bag
like kumar we can tell that hes in love
officer brucks and the bag of weed drink bottles of budweiser while sitting in the back of a pickup truck
brucks is skeet shooting as the bag of weed watches
brucks gives the bag a kiss after a successful round
brucks is having sex with the bag doggy style
he slaps its ass as he goes
brucks hugs and caresses the bag of weed as hes lost in the fantasy
our triumphant heros are gliding across the morning sky
harold and kumar look down as they soar above the trees
dude were so high right now
were not low
they continue gliding though the sky for a while
how are we gonna get down
i guess its just gonna go down at some point
thats a great answer
made me feel really comfortable
thanks a lot
kumar looks down as they fly over a playground
is it a problem if we fly into birds
why do you ask
because were about to
kumar looks up and sees at least a hundred crows flying oh shit
harold and kumar fly right into the crows
numerous birds collide with their faces
dont peck out my eyes
were gonna die
were gonna die
i hate you
i hate you so much
were gonna live
were gonna live
beat you see rold
that wasnt so bad
harold gets up before he can catch his breath
breathing heavily thats it
im gonna kill you
thats the point
youre gonna die
we made it dude
harold and kumar walk inside
their shirts are torn and tattered their bodies are scratched up and theyre covered in dirt
everyone in the restaurant turns and stares at them
they approach the counter where a teenager standing
looks like you guys had some night huh
harold and kumar look at each other and then back at the teenager
their expressions are stone cold
i want thirty slyders
i want five french fries
i want four large cherry cokes
only make mine diet cokes
that comes to
forty two dollars and seventy five cents
harold and kumar take out their wallets
they open them up
wheres my money
you dont have money
shit i gave all mine to that asshole at princeton
fuck that hippie fuck
this cant be happening
were so close and were fucking broke
let me take care of it
harold and kumar turn around and see neil patrick harris finishing his coke
he throws it in the trash
harold and kumar are stunned
what are you doing here
you guys kept talking about white castle last night
it made me start craving it too
wheres my fucking car you prick
sorry about that
like i said i was tripping balls last night
i dont know what came over me
your cars out in the parking lot
here are the keys
neil tosses harold the car keys
do you realize what we had to go through after you stole the car
it was a dick move on my part
thats why im paying for your meal
harold and kumar look at each other relieved
thanks i guess
neil hands them some cash
heres fifty for the meal and two hundred for the car
concerned what happened to the car
i made some love stains in the back seat
anyway take it easy guys
ill see you around
where are you going
wherever god takes me
with that neil walks out of the restaurant
harold and kumar look at each other confused
its gonna take a little while to make all those burgers
you might as well sit down
harold and kumar walk over to a booth and take a seat
dude were here
isnt it great
i cant believe we made it
and we got the car back
if we can just get out of here in a half hour i can get back to my office and get the work done
kumar points to a tv in the corner of the restaurant
on the screen we see a morning news show
todays top story
rutgers professor tarik jackson and attorney nathaniel banks are suing the state of new jersey for racial discrimination and police brutality
we go live to the municipal state courthouse in muckleburg
tarik and nathaniel have a bunch of microphones in front of them
what happened last night was a complete moral travesty
my family and i are outraged and will not settle for anything less than justice
we see tarik joined by his parents two old gay black men one is comforting the other
nathaniel walks in front of the microphone
very professional and by justice we mean somewhere in the ballpark of ten million dollars
to kumar hey good for those black guys
we see footage of officer palumbo and the other cops taken away in handcuffs
im not racist
this is bullshit
if those black bastards think theyre gonna get away with this theyve got another thing coming
me and my white buddies are gonna bleep them up
officer palumbo gets shoved forcefully into the back of a police car
harold and kumar enjoy this
this just in
police have arrested a gang of hooligans
we see a picture of cole and the extreme sports punks in the corner of the screen
after they found their abandoned car in the forest in clifton containing a large bag of marijuana
the young men could face up to five years in prison
harold and kumar slap five
the muckleburg police department has informed us that they are still looking for another fugitive who escaped from the police station last night along with a companion believed to be
harolds jaw drops
hes scared shitless
police have made the following sketch of the two fugitives which they believe to be quote extremely accurate
and kumar it is basically an asian man in his seventies to harold and kumar hey guys
i got your orders
harold and kumar run out of the booth
harold and kumar have put three tables together on which we see sixty white castle hamburgers each one steaming hot
two good looking guys jon and hayden stare at harold and kumars orders amazed by their size
they then look at their own orders and realize how worthless they are
harold and kumar are sitting across from one another looking at the smorgasbord in front of them
harold is about to dig wait
lets do it together
harold and kumar have finished their meals
they both look full and satisfied
harold takes one last sip of his soda
that hit the spot
it was the best meal of my life
the two of them sit there looking at all the empty containers and wrappers
after a long pause of silence kumar speaks
dude you know what
i think i may actually go to my interview today
you know my whole life ive been afraid being just another nerdy indian guy turned doctor
well tonight got me thinking
there are far worse things in the world than being tagged for having a natural ability in medicine
harold pretends to be listening to kumar but he is more focused on billy and j
who get out of the car with their women and start walking towards the front door
like having boils all over your face
or dealing with the shit those black guys had to go through
not paying attention uh huh
besides i have to admit it felt pretty cool saving that guys life last night
somewhere between that getting yelled at by my dad and seeing neil patrick harris i realized that ive always wanted to be a doctor ive just been too scared to
kumar sees that harold isnt paying attention
hey rold are you listening to me
im having a major epiphany here
ill be right back
at that moment billy and j
walk in the restaurant with their women zoe and tracy respectively
tracy looks like some bimbo slut that j
picked up at a strip club
zoe on the other hand has a sweet renee zellweger quality about her
she and billy are the perfect hollywood couple
hey billy you paying for this or what
ill be there in a second
and tracy check out the menu
billy takes zoe aside whatever their story is it seems to have reached the you complete me moment
look i have to admit something to you
at the start of last night all i really cared about was getting some
but then i met you zoe
youre so different from all the other women ive ever met
youre smart funny artistic
i guess what im trying to say is
what the fuck is going on here
billy turns around and sees harold
what are you
never mind me
what are you doing here
i thought you and j
were busy all night with clients
isnt that why i had to do your work
hears the commotion and turns around
what the hell is going on here
back off cock boy
what i have to say to him goes double for you
kumar sees whats going on he cant believe it
im sorry but did you just call me cock boy
yeah you know i did
youre just stalling because youre not quick enough to think of a comeback
oh im not quick enough
to billy he thinks im not quick enough
to harold well i got news for you
long beat thinking i am quick enough
beat cock boy
billy tries to placate the situation
to billy dont even bother with him
well just tell berenson later
tell him what
that im your work horse
that you guys think you can just party all weekend and leave all your work to the quiet asian guy in your office
now hes a little nervous
no no you dont understand
no you dont understand
im not doing your work anymore
harold contd and if either one of you douchebags ever tries to pull this shit again ill go to berenson and tell him whats really going on
harold notices traci and zoe listening
and ill tell everyone in the office how you both caught gonorrhea from that whore
traci and zoe hear this and are freaked out
they slowly back away from billy and j
now if youll excuse me i have to get going
see you on monday
harold leaves the restaurant
billy and j
are left embarrassed and in shock
harold and kumar walk over to harolds infiniti
way to go rold
where the hell did that come from
i dont know
eating those delicious burgers made me feel like a new man
now im actually looking forward to work this week
i guess youre worthwhile after all
im not worthless
so those dudes have gonorrhea
beat now come on lets get going
whats the rush
theres plenty of time before my interview
i have some unfinished business to take care of
they both get into the car harold gets in the drivers side
the car zooms out
the elevator doors open
harold and kumar exit
kumar gives harold a pat on the back
good luck dude
kumar stands behind while harold approaches marias door
what do you want
come back to bed
calling to woman hey papis coming
to harold laughing this girl is crazy man
luis contd she seemed so sweet at first but it turns out shes into some pretty freaky shit
she even did this thing where she took a lollipop and shoved it
grossed out depressed look i really dont need to hear it
i guess i just made a mistake
sorry for interrupting you guys
harold starts to walk away almost crying
sad depressing music begins to play
kumar feels sorry for his friend
just then luis leans his head out the door
hey if youre looking for maria she left for europe this morning
harold quickly turns around and runs back over
shes going to amsterdam for ten days
im luis marias brother
luis shakes harolds hand
harold suddenly feels better
you must be that chinese guy maria keeps talking about
actually im kor
wait a second she talks about me
a hot black chick aisha wearing only a bra and g string walks over to luis and wraps her arms around him
are you coming or what
hey ill be there in a second baby
do me a favor make me that omelette you were talking about
you know with the sun dried tomatoes
aisha kisses him and walks away to the kitchen
luis gives her a little a slap on the ass
harold doesnt quite know how to respond to this
to harold so you want me to leave her a message or something
uh no thanks
id rather do it in person
then take it easy hermano
luis shuts the door
kumar runs over to harold
we gotta go
we can pack up right now and take the next plane
what are you talking about
are you out of your mind
what about your interview with the med school guy
ill tell my dad to reschedule it
he wont have a problem as long as im taking it seriously for a change
now lets fly to europe and find maria
shes coming back in ten days
its not like im never gonna see her again
for a hot chick ten days in europe is the kiss of death
there are gonna be suave sophisticated guys all over her
by the time she gets back she may not be available
harold feels a little nervous about what kumar is saying
ill just wait till she comes back
harold starts to walk away from kumar
you do realize whats legal in amsterdam right
