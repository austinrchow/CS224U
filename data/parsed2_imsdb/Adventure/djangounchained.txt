written by quentin tarantino as the films opening credit sequence plays complete with its own spaghetti western theme song we see seven shirtless and shoeless black male slaves connected together
with leg irons being run by two white male hillbillies on horseback
the location is somewhere in texas
the black men roy big sid benjamin django pudgy ralph franklyn and blueberry are slaves just recently purchased at the greenville slave auction in greenville mississippi
the white hillbillies are two slave traders called the speck brothers ace and dicky
one of the seven slaves is our hero django
hes fourth in the leg iron line
we may or may not notice a tiny small r burned into his cheek r for runaway but we cant help but notice his back which has been slashed to
ribbons by bull whip beatings
as the operatic opening theme song plays we see a montage of misery and pain as django and the other men are walked through blistering sun pounding rain and moved
along by the end of a whip
bare feet step on hard rock and slosh through mud puddles
leg irons take the skin off ankles
as the credits play django has a spaghetti western flashback
now spaghetti western flashbacks are never pretty its usually the time in the film when the lead character thinks back to the most painful memory inflicted on him or his
loved ones from evil characters from his past
in this instance we see django in a slave pen at the greenville auction
amongst many other shoulders and heads sees through the bars of the cell door his wife broomhilda being led to the auction block
he fights his way to the door and far off and obscure in the distance he can see broomhilda up on the auction block and in the distance he hears
the auctioneer yell sold
then shes taken away to whereabouts unknown never to be seen again
as the sun continues to beat down on djangos head he remembers django in the slave pen with what seems like a one hundred and fifty slaves in a cell
designed for forty
white men yank him out
of the cell shirtless shoeless and lead him down a hallway into a giant round pen an audience viewing area circles the round pen floor on three different stories of
the ground floor is covered by the big money buyers who stand in front of the auction block
is moved into a line of slaves the black men and their masters their white owners and their sellers the white man actually doing the sales pitch on the auction
block as they wait for their turn on the block
a slave robbie stand on the auction block in view of the room full of buyers the seller sells and the owners stand off to the side
takes in the environment around him
django has never cared for white folks but these white folks are in particularly ugly
its djangos turn on the auction block as the theme song wails its tragic crescendo django is brought up on the auction block
looks down at all the white people who want to buy niggers who look up to him
his heart fills with poison
walking in leg irons with his six other companions walking across the blistering texas panhandle
its night time and the speck brothers astride horses keep pushing their black skinned cargo forward
its a very pitch black night with only a few stars in the
sky to create a little top light
its so dark the slavers use the creek
bed to keep from getting lost
both speck brothers carry a lantern up on their horse as
does roy the slave in lead position on the chain gang
its also a bitterly cold night with the breath of the seven slaves two slavers and two horses creating clouds in the air
in fact the seven chained together slaves with the lead one holding a lantern and all of them chugging out smoky breath and
slightly moving in unison resemble a human locomotive
the slaves shiver from the cold on their shirtless backs both speck brothers wear rawhide winter coats with white fur linings and white fur collars
a sound and a small light appears ahead of them on the road
this makes the slave traders stop their human live stock and ready their rifles for possible trouble
carrying a dressed in grey rider clip clops from the background to the foreground illuminated by a glowing lantern that the rider carries
appears to be a tenderfoot due to his style of dress
a long grey wintercoat over a grey three piece business suit and a grey bowler hat on his head
whos that stumblin around in the dark
state your business or prepare to get winged
calm yourselves gentlemen i mean you no harm
im simply a fellow weary traveler
the rider dressed in business grey pulls his horse to a stop in front of the two slavers and their slaves lifting the lantern up to his face
he speaks with a slight german accent
to the slavers good cold evening gentlemen
to the shivering slaves good evening im looking for a pair of slave traders that go by thename of the speck brothers
might that be you
who wants to
king schultz and this is my horse fritz
fritz does a little bow with his head a neat trick the doctor taught him
you a doctor
what kinda doctor
are you the speck brothers and did you purchase those men at the greenville
schultz so i wish to parley with you
schultz oh im sorry
please forgive me it is a second language
amongst your inventory ive been led to believe is a specimen im keen to acquire
to the slaves hello you poor devils
is there one among you who was formerly a resident of the carrucan plantation
since roy in lead position is the one holding the lantern the second half of the slave centipede falls off into darkness
in the darkness a voice rings out im from the carrucan plantation
schultz moves fritz forward towards the darkness raises his lantern illuminating our hero django
and whats your name young man
youre exactly the one im looking for
so tell me django by the way thats a amazing name during your time at the carrucan plantation did you come to know three overseers by the name of the
django nods his head yes
schultz is delighted
schultz big john ellis and little brother raj
dem da brittle brothers
schultz so django do you think you could recognize i
the speck brothers have been watching this tenderfoot engage their slave in polite conversation
with a touch of disbelief
hey stop talkin to him like that
schultz like what
schultz my good man im simply trying to ascertain speak english goddamit
schultz everybody calm down
im simply a customer trying to conduct a transaction
i dont care no sale
now off wit ya
schultz dont be ridiculous of course theyre for sale
ace raises his rifle towards the german
ace cocks back the rifle hammer
schultz my good man did you simply get carried away with your dramatic gesture or are you pointing that weapon at me with lethal intention
last chance fancy pants dr
schultz very well the doctor throws his lantern to the ground enveloping him in darkness
the next flash of light we see is the good doctors pistol out of his holster and firing point blank into ace specks face
blowing the dumber dumb brother off his horse dead in the dirt
before dicky can maneuver either his rifle or his horse in the germans direction
schultz shoots his horse in the head
the steed goes down taking dicky with him
when the dead weight horse lands on dickys slightly twisted leg we hear two distinct cracking sounds
dicky lets out a bitch like scream
the slaves watch all this
theyve never seen a white man kill another white man before
dicky is pinned down under his ole paint
django watches in the dark the german climb down off his horse pick up aces discarded lantern and walk over to the remaining speck
schultz sorry about putting a bullet in your beast
but i didnt want you to do anything rash before you had a moment to come to your senses
ultz lights the lantern illuminating himself as he stands over dickys body
you goddamn son of a bitch you killed ace
i only shot your brother once he threatened to shoot me
and i do believe i have
one two three four five six seven witnesses who can attest to that fact
my damn legs busted
schultz no doubt
now if you can keep your caterwauling down to a minimum id like to finish my line of inquiry with young django
as i was saying if you were to see the brittle brothers again would you recognize them
schultz now im sure
to you all unshaven white men look alike
so django in a crowd of unshaven white men can you honestly and positively point out the brittle brothers
were in his little shack at the carrucan plantation
its pissing rain outside
django is making love to his wife broomhilda when she stops letting out a shout
the three overseers known as the brittle brothers are outside peeking in through the window
they burst in through the front door
soaked to the bone they rodeo bull their way into the shack and make the two slaves continue fucking for their amusement
as django and broomhilda are forced to copulate they run their wet white hands down her chocolate leg
they fondle his ass
they squeeze her tit
they bring a belt across djangos backside to make him fuck faster
then they yank him off as big john climbs on top of broomhilda
the other brittle brothers whip django with their belts and make him sit in the corner while they finish with his wife
i can point em out
schultz sold american
speck how much for django
im gonna lose this leg
schultz yes unless you find a talented physician very quickly im afraid that will be the
but back to business how much do you want for django
you go to hell
schultz dont be silly
how much for django
schultz oh come now i may not have the experience in the slave trade that you and your family does but neither was i born yesterday
good doctor removes a pamphlet from his grey suit coat pocket
schultz in this most helpful pamphlet that i picked up at the greenville slave auction it says that the going rate for african flesh in particularly a field nigger is
sixty to eighty dollars
now handsome no doubt as django is technically he is a field
which according to this pamphlet here and why would they lie puts his price at eighty dollars
so in light of that how bout a hundred and twenty five dollars for young django here
schultz removes his long billfold from his pocket and takes out a one hundred dollar bill two tens and a fiver
schultz and since your late brother
wont be using it anymore id like to purchase his nag
he removes a twenty dollar gold piece from his
pocket and tosses it on dickys body
he bends down and puts the paper money
in the saddle bags on dickys dead horse
his hands in there he roots around and finds the keys to the leg irons
he unlocks djangos leg irons
django is free
schultz there you go django
give your ankles a good rubbing then get up on that horse
also if i was you id take that winter coat the dear departed speck left behind
django removes the coat from the dead slaver
puts on the warm jacket over his bare back and climbs up on ace specks horse
schultz turns to dicky on the ground
speck i am afraid i will require a bill of sale
do you have one
dicky just curses him
he says removing a notebook from his pocket dr
schultz i thought not
no worries i come prepared
as he writes this will serve nicely as a bill of sale
he stops then says to django django is spelled with a silent d is it not
schultz why not
he writes it in his book with a silent d then stops to admire the way it looks
schultz yes that does add a little character
the german dentist lowers himself by the speck brother pinned down under his horse and hands him the notebook and pen
schultz if youd be so kind speck as to make your mark here
hillbilly spits in the german gentlemans face
the good doctor wipes his face with a handkerchief
then takes out a pocket knife
and whispers something that cant be heard in the slavers ear
he signs the bill of sale
speck i would like to say it was a pleasure doing business with you but your customer service leaves a lot to be desired
the good doctor climbs back up on fritz and looks to the six slaves in leg irons
schultz now as to you poor devils
he tosses to pudgy ralph the keys to the shackles
schultz so as i
see it when it comes to the subject of what to do next you gentlemen have two choices
one once im gone you lift that beast off the remaining speck then carry him to the nearest town
which would be at least thirty seven miles back the way you came
two you unshackle yourselves take that rifle over there
put a bullet in his head bury the two of them deep and make your way to a more enlightened area of the country
the choice is yours
hes just about ready to ride off when the good doctor adds dr
schultz oh and on the off chance that theres any astronomy aficionados amongst you the north star is that one
he looks to django who doesnt know how to start his horse
schultz just give him a little kick
django does and the horse responds by moving
schultz see its not so difficult
the dawn breaks on a western landscape
the two men ride their horses silently horse hooves clip clopping among the rocks
django wears specks winter coat with one of dr
schultzs white button down dress shirts underneath it
as they ride through the picturesque scene
schultz breaks the silence
schultz so django what do you intend to name him
schultz your horse
schultz the horse youre riding
this aint my horse
schultz yes it is
no it aint its your horse
im just riding it
schultz well technically yes wait a minute technically not
if its my horse i can give it to you and as of now im doing such
django youre now the proud owner of a horse congratulations
i cant feed no horse
i cant put no horse up in no stable
schultz dont worry about all that
they ride a bit longer in silence
the good doctor composes himself
then says with a smile dr
now that thats settled
what do you intend to name it
half the fun of having a horse is choosing his name
for instance my steed is named fritz
hes stubborn ornery and prone to a bad disposition but i couldnt do without him
he pats fritzs neck anyway the name of ones steed isnt something one does lightly
so once youve thought about it for awhile tony
schultz tony what
i dunno tony the horse
schultz oh you mean you want to name your horse tony
thats what you jus asked me right
schultz when youre right youre right indeed i did
i gotta tell ya
you didnt tell me i gotta tell ya
as they continue to converse they start heading downhill toward a western town
they pass by a sign that says welcome to daughtrey dr
schultz well im naturally curious of course but theres no reason you must tell me
in fact an air of mystery adds a dash of panache to any steed
and i do believe tony wears it well
good job django well done
as the citizens of daughtrey wake up django and dr
schultz ride fritz and tony through the main street of town
daughtrey looks like a million western towns weve seen before in movies
but to the townspeople of daughtrey django and the german dont look like a million other visitors
schultz whats everybody staring at
they never seen a nigger on a horse before
schultz whats this bizarre obsession they have with
you not riding horses
you askin me
schultz stops fritz in front of a saloon and dismounts
django has a little trouble both stopping tony and getting off him but it gets done
schultz keeps bombarding the slave with questions
schultz so what other archaic rituals are you people verboten to take part in
as per usual with this white man django thinks what
schultz im just trying to get a clear idea on what you can do and what you cant do and if you cant do it why cant you do it
like for instance what if we were to walk in this saloon here sit down at a table order a drink and drink it
would the authorities frown on that
hell yeah they gonna frown
schultz what part would they find the most offensive
all of it
i cant be walkin in no saloon
i cant be sittin my ass on no chair at no table
i cant be drinkin no drink
and i definitely cant be sharin no drink with no white man in public
schultz so if you and i did those things that would be considered enough of a infraction to make the saloon keeper go get the sheriff
you bet your sweet ass they get the sheriff
the good doctor extends his hand towards the saloon entrance
schultz well in that case django after you
whoa i aint funnin i cant go in there
schultz django youre going to have to learn to trust me and as the man said theres no time like the present
he takes django by the arm and leads him into the entryway of the establishment
the nervous black slave and the confident germandentist walk into the saloon
the saloon keeper pete is high up on a chair placed high up on a table to change a candle in the saloons chandelier
his back is turned away from the two patrons
schultz good morning inn keeper two beers for two weary travelers
it s still pretty early we wont be open for about a hour
but by then well be servin breakfast he turns around and sees them
what the hell you think you doin boy get that nigger outta here
its about five minutes later and the saloon keeper comes running out of the bar to get the sheriff
schultz sitting at a table with the young django calls dr
schultz inn keeper
remember get the sheriff not the marshall
this wouldnt be the marshalls jurisdiction
this is just a infraction on what i assume is a simple county ordinance and that would fall under the domain of the sheriff
the saloon keeper runs away
the two men sit by themselves in the empty saloon
schultz it looks like we must act as our own bartender
the german stands up and walks behind the bar and pours two beers from the tap into mugs
django remains seated and after a beat asks what kinda dentist are you
this makes the doctor laugh as he pours the beers
schultz i havent practiced dentistry in five years not to say once i know you better i wouldnt like to get a look at that mouth im sure its a
disaster but these days i practice a new profession
this gets no reaction from django
schultz do you know what a bounty hunter is
the black man shakes his head no
as the good doctor walks back to the table carrying the mugs of beer dr
schultz well the way the slave trade deals in human lives for cash a bounty hunter deals in corpses
schultz contd the state places a bounty on a mans head
i track that man i find that man i kill that man
after ive killed him i transport that mans corpse back to the authorities and sometimes thats easier said then done
i show that corpse to the authorities proving yes indeed i have truly killed him at which point the authorities pay me the bounty
lifting his beer cheers
the two men touch glasses and take a drink
whats a bounty
schultz its like a reward
you kill people and they give you a reward
schultz certain people yes
a few mexicans
schultz badder they are bigger the reward
which brings me to you and i must admit im at a bit of a quandary when it comes to you
on one hand i despise slavery
on the other hand i need your help and if youre not in a position to refuse all the better
so for the time being im going to make this slave malarkey work to my benefit
having said that
i feel guilty
id like the two of us to enter into an agreement
im looking for the brittle brothers however in this endeavor im at a slight disadvantage in so far as i dont know what they look like
but you do
django spaghetti western flashback django back at the carrucan plantation held down by roger and ellis brittle as big john burns the r into his cheek with a branding iron
i know what they look like all right
so heres my agreement
you travel with me till we find them where we goin
schultz i hear at least two of them are overseeing up in gatlinburg but i dont know where
that means we visit every plantation in gatlinburg till we find them
and when we find them you point them out and i kill them
you do that i agree to give you your freedom
twenty five dollars per brittle brother thats seventy five dollars
your horse tony even though ive already gave him to you but once the final brittle brother lies dead in the dust ill buy you a new saddle and a
new suit of clothes handsome cowboy hat included
schultzs eyes go to the saloon window
schultz and as if on cue
here comes the sheriff
we see the sheriff bill sharp walk towards the saloon cradling a winchester
some townspeople like the saloon keeper stand around to watch
young boy leads a herd of baby goats through town
sheriff sharp stands in the middle of the street
okay boys funs over come on out
both the doctor and django stand up and walk to the front porch
as they do the sheriff says now why yall wanna come into my town start trouble and scare all these nice people
you aint got nothin better to do then to come into bill sharps town and show your ass from his top step on the porch dr
king schultz extends his hand toward the sheriff as if to shake it
a small derringer pops into schultzs hand from a metal sliding apparatus concealed under his jacket sleeve
once in hand the dentist fires one tiny bullet into the belly of bill sharp
the tiny gun makes a tiny pop sound
the shocked bill sharp lets out a ugly groan and doubles over in the dirt
the townspeople are startled
as is django
as schultz walks down the porch steps to the fallen sheriff reloading his tiny pop shooter a pedestrian yells out what did you jus do to our sheriff
schultz answers him by putting another tiny bullet in the law mans skull killing him dead
in the background one woman faints
the boy and his goats scatter
schultz looks over at the saloon keeper across the street
schultz now you can go get the marshall
marshall gill tatum snaps the menfolk of daughtrey to attention
move that buckboard over there long ways across the street from the saloon
and i want six men and six winchesters behind it
and i want two men with two rifles on this roof and two men with two rifles on that roof with all barrels pointed at that front door
and somebody git poor bill outta the goddamn street
cowboys with rifles climb up stairs to take position on the roof of the building across the street from the saloon
the marshall directs the buckboard being moved into place
the last sniper on the rooftop takes his position
schultz sits behind the piano playing a catchy little saloon number
he seems skilled enough to be a professional western saloon piano player
a terrified django whos sure his new master is a lunatic whos going to get them both killed peeks out the closed curtains on the window
schultzs suit coat sits draped over a chair
all of his weapons including his metal sliding rail derringer contraption lie on a table
he plays piano in his button down dress shirt and gray suit vest
schultz what are they doing
i think they wonderin why you playin the piana
but what are they doing
a buncha white folks brought a buckboard around out front now they hidin behind it with guns
and a buncha other white folks are up on the roof with rifles pointed down here
schultz damn they got that organized fast
is the marshall out there
if the one i think is the
marshall is the marshall hes out there
schultz what makes you think hes the marshall
cause hes the one ready to say somethin
you in the saloon
schultz stops playing the piano
we got eleven winchesters on every way outta that buildin
you got once chance git outta this alive
you and your nigger come out right now with your hands over your head and i mean right now
schultz first things first
is this the marshall i have the pleasure of addressing
yes it is this is u
marshall gill tatum
so marshall i have relieved myself of all weapons and just as you have instructed im ready to step outside with my hands raised above my head
i trust as a representative of the criminal justice system of the united states of america i shant be shot down in the street by either you or your deputies
before ive had my day in court
you mean like you did our sheriff
shot em down like a dog in the street
schultz yes thats exactly what i mean
do i have your word as a lawman not to shoot me down like a dog in the street
well as much as wed all enjoy seein somethin like that aint nobody gonna cheat the hangman in my town
schultz fair enough marshall here we
schultz theyre a little tense out there
so dont make any quick movements and let me do the talking
django looks at him like as if
a lot of guns are trained on the front door of the saloon
outside of range the whole town watches the stand off
the saloon doors open and dr
schultz and django hands raised step outside
schultz yes indeed we are
marshall tatum may i address you your deputies and apparently the entire town of daughtrey as to the incident that just occurred
schultz my name is dr
and like yourself marshall i am a servant of the court
the man lying dead in the dirt who the good people of daughtrey saw fit to elect as their sheriff who went by the name of bill sharp is actually
a wanted outlaw by the name of willard peck with a price on his head of two hundred dollars
thats two hundred dollars dead or alive
the hell you say
m aware this is probably disconcerting news
but im willing to wager this man was elected sheriff sometime in the last two years
i know this because
three years ago he was rustling cattle from the b
corrigan cattle company of lubbock texas
schultz contd in my possession
is a warrant made out by circuit court judge henry allen laudermilk of austin texas
you are encouraged to wire him
he will back up who i am and who your dear departed sheriff was
the menfolk of the town with rifles begin trading looks
schultz delivers the coup de grace
schultz in other words marshall you owe me two hundred dollars
django and dr
schultz who by now have ridden quite a few miles together ride their horses in the tennessee countryside on the way to gatlinburg
schultz is dressed in one of his nearly identical grey business suits and django is still dressed in his slave pants schultzs button down dress shirt and ace specks winter
somewhere along the way a pair of shoes have appeared onhis feet
schultz one needs a plan son
these are brutal times
a man who survives is a man with a plan
a man who thrives is a man with a good plan
so having said that whats your plan young django
schultz well after this brittle business is behind us youll be a free man with a horse and seventy five dollars in your back pocket
whats your plan after that
find my wife and buy her freedom
schultz django i had no idea you were a married man
do most slaves take the institution of matrimony seriously
schultz do slaves believe in marriage
me and my wife do
schultz where is she now
they put us in different boxcars and sent u
s to the greenville slave auction
she got sold two days fore me
but i dont know who to
schultz takes out a long stick of beef jerky
schultz care for some jerky
schultz rips him off a piece
django chews on it
as he chews dr
schultz so your plan is to trackdowri your wife and purchase her
only you dont know where she is
a chewing django nods his head yes
schultz takes a big bite of jerky chews for a moment contemplating the dilemma then pronounces dr
schultz well that shouldnt be all that difficult
so how long ago did all this happen
a few months ago
schultz three or four
schultz so shecamefrom the carrucan plantation and shewassold at the greenville slave auctiontosome unknown customer three monthsago
django nods his head yes
schultz the bad part about slavery being a business is its immoral
the good part about it being a business is they keep records
somewhere in greenville theres a book with your wifes name in it and the name of the customer who bought her and more then likely their address
but then schultz seems to get second thoughts
schultz still seventy five dollars in your back pocket is a pretty nice grub steak but its not going to get you very far in greenville
not to mention a slave auction town in mississippi isnt the safest place you could visit
free or not
ill have my freedom papers
schultz yes you will
but say you show them to some rascals and they take them from you and tear them up
they could do that
schultz im not saying they would but they could
they do that ill kill em
now you get hung for killin a white man
the point being is the place is just too dangerous for you
well i gotta go when do i go
schultz when you get more dangerous
muddy and wet big city chattanooga
were in the back of a store that
sells servant house nigger uniforms
django comes bursting out of the stores back door
hes very distressed
one glance at the outfit hes wearing explains the distress
is dressed in a powder blue satin little lord fauntleroy outfit that wouldnt be out of place in the court of marie antoinette at versailles
schultz comes trailing after him
schultz django you have to its part of the act
youre playing a character
your character is the valet
this is what the valet wears
remember what i told you
during the act you can never break character
we see dr
schultz riding slightly in front of django dressed in his blue satin little lord fauntleroy outfit as they enter the property of bennett manor a plantation in gatlinburg tennessee
django leads a riderless horse behind him and tony
as the two men ride their horses up the road that leads to the front steps of bennett manor alongside the cotton fields all the slaves stop picking cotton and
straighten their bent backs up to stare in wonder at this sight
the patriarch of bennett manor spencer big daddy bennett dressed in a fancy leisure suit of the day emerges from the double doors of the mansion and stands on the
top steps hands on hips watching the white man and black man move from the background to the foreground
while there are plenty black males out in the cotton fields the majority of the slave population of bennett manor is pretty
black females fourteen to twenty four referred to as ponys
the biggest money making crop of this farm after cotton
schultz and fancy pants django bring fritz and tony to a stop in front of bennett manor theyve drawn quite a crowd of slaves bennett family members and white workers
spencer bennett keeps on the top step so he wont be forced to look up at the darkee on the horse
its against the law for niggers to ride horses in this territory
schultz this is my valet and my valet doesnt walk
i said niggers z
schultz his name is django hes a free man and he can ride what he pleases
not on my
property around my niggers he cant
schultz my good sir perhaps we got off on the wrong boot
allow me to unring this bell
my name is dr
king schultz this is my valet django and these are our horses fritz and tony
fritz does his head bow
this makes the pretty ponys surrounding bennett giggle
bennett ive been lead to believe you are a gentleman and a business man
and it is in these capacities that weve ridden from texas to tennessee to talk with you now
state your business
schultz i wish to purchase one of your nigger gals
you and your jimmie rode from texas to tennessee to buy one of my nigger gals no appointment no nuttin
schultz im afraid so
well what if i say i dont like you or your fancy pants
nigger and i wouldnt sell you a tinkers damn whatcha gotta say about that
bennett if you are the business man ive been led to believe you to be i have five thousand things i might say that could change your mind
i this gets everybodys attention not least of all spencer bennett
cmon inside get yourself something cool to drink
the incognito bounty hunter dismounts his steed as does django
then the good doctor walks up the steps to bennett manor
schultz maybe while we discuss business you could provide one of your loveliest black creatures to escort django here around your magnificent grounds
a pretty fleshy sweet jelled twenty two year old slave gal named betina snaps to attention
yes sir big daddy
whats your jimmies name again
betina sugar take django around the grounds
show em all the pretty stuff
as you please big daddy
schultz lowers his voice and says to the plantation owner dr
bennett i must remind you django is a free man
he cannot be treated like a slave
within the bounds of good taste he must be treated as an extension of myself
django isnt a slave
django is a free man
do you understand
youre not to treat him like any of these other niggers around here cause he aint like any of these other niggers around here
ya got it
ya want i should treat em like white folks
no thats not what i said
then i dont know whatcha want big daddy
yes i can see that
whats the name of that peckawood boy from town works with the glass
his mama works at the lumber yard
he comes by and fixes the windas when we have a problem
the mammy of bennett manor chimes in oh you mean jerry
yeah thats the boys name jerry
you know jerry dontcha sugar
yes em big daddy
well thats it then
just treat em like you would jerry
away from the big house betina gives django a tour of the grounds
her in her slave get up complete with handkerchief on her head and him in his satin baby blue little lord fauntleroy outfit are quite the pair
she eyeballs him disapprovingly up and down
whatcha do for your massa
didnt you hear him tell ya i aint no slave
so you really free
you mean you wanna dress like that
both spencer bennett and dr
schultz sit on the back porch drinking lemonade
schultz ive beentold by those who should know the most exquisite african flesh in the state of tennessee is bred right here on your land
and from the look of these black angels my sources werent wrong
oh i got my share of coal blacks horse faces and gummy mouth bitches out in the field
but the lion share of my lady niggers are real show ponys
schultz well thats what im looking for a show pony for young django
so the only question that remains is do you have a nigger here worth five thousand dollars
schultz five thousand dollar nigger is practically my middle name
betina and django walk by a big tree on the plantation grounds
the cotton fields and the slaves picking it in the background
betina come over here i need to ask you something
he moves her by the tree for more privacy
betina thinks this fancy pants wants to get all lovey dovey and she couldnt be less interested
im lookin for three white men
their name is brittle
do you know em
and roger brittle sometimes called little raj
i dont know dem
they could be usin a different name
they woulda come to the plantation in the last year
you mean the shaffers
are they here
can you point one of em out to me
well ones over in that field
she points to the cotton field at a overseer on top of a horse whip in hand eyeing the blacks at his mercy
django takes hold of a little bag slung over his shoulder opens it and takes out a shiny brass spyglass the type a sea captain might use
obviously a prop from dr
he slides it open places it against his eye and points it in the direction of a figure out in the cotton field landscape
astride his nag the filthy hillbilly who calls himself shaffer but who django knows to be ellis brittle looks on oblivious to djangos observation
he remembers ellis brittle burning a r into broomhildas cheek with a he lowers the glass
is that who you lookin for
he folds the spyglass back up and puts it back in his purse
wheres the other two
they by the stable punishin little jody for breakin eggs
they whippin little jody
she nods her head yes
point me in that direction
she points to a shed and keeps pointing right
you go to that shed and keep goin that way
which means go to the shed and turn right
go git that white man i came here with
he slaps her ass to hurry her up
then looks to the shed and begins crossing the distance between him and the brittle brothers
a memory from the carrucan plantation the brittle brothers giving his wife broomhilda a peelin
peelin a punishment by bullwhip across the back
little raj makes a line in the dirt with the heel of his boot
making django stand behind it as he watches his wife being whipped
big john brittle slashes the beauty of broomhildas back with his django keeping behind the line begs big john for mercy
please big john she wont do it no more
shes real sorry
the whip rips her back
goddamit big john
whoa nigger calm down keep it funny
django gets on his knees and on behalf of broomhild
a begs big john brittle with everything he has
crossing the lawn towards the brittle brothers like an express train
big john brittle standing over him bullwhip in hand saying to the i like the way you beg boy
little raj brittle ties little jody a petite slave girl eighteen to a dead tree stump
big john brittle paces taking a few practice cracks with his whip
little jody begs the shaffer brothers the brittle brothers for mercy
roger goes and sits on a old wagon wheel to watch the whippin
now jody quit your caterwaulin
you know yourself its for your own good
niggers are clumsy
youd break everything in goddamn sight you werent cured
and the only known cure for nigger clumsiness is a peelin
little jody begs to differ
as django in his powder blue satin suit hurries across the grass to little jody and the brittle brothers he collects eight little friends who happily run along with the
fast walking man
eight little french bulldogs who bark yelp snort and breath at his heels
django pays the little dogs no nevermind
in position to take the skin off of little jodys back
after this well see if you break eggs again
turns the corner to the stable and stands behind them
they dont see him
big john rears back to make the first whip lash
djangos voice stops him john brittle
big john breaks his whip stride looks
up and in a discarded full length broken mirror from the big house laying abandoned against the stable wall he sees django dressed in his powder blue satin little lord
flauntleroy outfit surrounded by his pack of little french bulldogs
little jody on her knees tied to the dead tree stump looks up sees the same thing in the mirror
little raj looks to his left at the sounds of the voice
big john turns toward django who he still doesnt recognize
django just stares back
big john smile disappears
he recognizes django
so does roger
django crosses toward big john raising up his arm like hes going to shake his hand
django extends his arm and dr
schultzs derringer arm contraption
pops the tiny gun into his hand and he fires a tiny bullet smack dab into big johns merciless heart
goes into shock
he falls to his knees
he looks up clutching his heart at django
i like the way you die boy
big john hears it
then tips over dead
little jody cant believe what shes just seen
four other slaves who just happen to be walking in the background see it
little raj is stunned
then comes to his senses fumbling for the gun he wears on his hip but since hes no gunman in his haste he gets it out of his holster but
drops it on the ground
it goes off
shooting himself in the foot he hops up and down in pain
the bulldogs scatter at the sound
of the bang
django picks big johns whip off the ground
and begins whipping little raj across the face and chest
more slaves gather
whips him on the ground then throws the whip to the ground picks rogers pistol off the ground and empties it five shots into roger
to say the slaves are flabbergasted is a understatement
schultz rides his horse up quickly rifle in his hand
he sees django and the two dead bodies
schultz who are they
thats john brittle and thats his little brother raj
schultz wheres ellis
hes the one hightailin it across that field right now
ellis brittle riding his horse full out through the cotton field trying to make an escape
goes to his eye he follows the rider with his rifle barrel
schultz are you sure thats him
ellis gets further away
schultz are you positive
ellis gets further away
schultz you dont know if youre positive
ellis gets further away
i dont know what positive means
schultz it means youre sure
schultz yes what
yes im sure thats ellis brittle
the german picks the middle brittle brother off his horse
the dead man wipes out horribly in the thick cotton brush
red blood splashes on white cotton
the german and django have the entire plantations attention
spencer bennett with his winchester his sons and his overseers and some house niggers come around like a angry mob
the german tosses his rifle in the dirt and raises his hands
django does the same with his pistol
schultz addresses the angry mob
schultz everybody calm down we mean no one else any harm
just who the hell are you two jokers
schultz i am dr
king schultz a legal representative of the criminal justice system of the united states of america
the man to my left is django freeman hes my
in my pocket is a warrant signed by circuit court judge henry allen laudermilk of austin texas for the arrest and capture dead or alive of john brittle ellis brittle
and roger brittle they were goin by the name shaffer
schultz you know them by the name shaffer
but the butchers real nameswere brittle
these are wanted men
the law wants them for murder
i reiterate this warrant states dead or alive
when django and myself executed these men on sight we were operating within our legal
now i realize passions are high
but i must warn you the penalty for taking deadly force against a officer of the court in the performance of his duty is you will be hung by the
neck until you are dead
this does put a momentary pause in the lynch mobs blood lust
after his dramatic pause for effect
schultz says dr
schultz may i please remove the warrant from my pocket so you may examine it
resting his winchester over his shoulder bennett reaches for the paper
schultz removes the warrant from his jacket pocket and hands it to the plantation owner
bennett reads it silently to himself resigned to what it says
bennett eyes go from the warrant to the german
schultz may i have that back
bennett hands schultz back the piece of paper
schultz we good
get off my land
schultz post haste
load up the bodies as quickly as you can and lets get out of here
all three dead brittle brothers lie over the back of the extra horse the bounty hunters brought with them
both bounty hunters are back in their saddles ready to leave
with all the eyes of the plantation on them the white and black man start to ride out when spencer big daddy bennett steps in their way for one final
aint nobody gonna touch you and your jimmie while you on my property
but for lettin a nigger kill a white man and especially for letting a nigger kill a white man in a audience of niggers yall aint gonna make it out
of the county alive
mark my words schultz by tomorrow morning your niggers gonna be stripped and clipped and hangin from my motherfuckin gate
schultz im fully aware bennett that you and your regulator playmates arent shy about killing for what you believe in
but mark my words big daddy if you make a move towards django or myself you better be prepared to die for it
the two men ride off
the black and white audience watch them go
schultzs saddle bag the doctors hands remove three sticks
of dynamite from it
insert the doctors hands bind the three sticks of dynamite together
insert the three sticks are wrapped up in a bright yellow bandana
insert the yellow dynamite sticks are buried in dirt about half way with the yellow part protruding from out of the ground
lying on his belly in the grass
thats them sonsabitches
we see the camp by the lake that dr
schultz and django have set up
both wrapped up in bedrolls
the dead bodies of the brittle brothers lie by them in a pile
a campfire slowly dims
we cut back to spencer bennett lying on his belly with six other rifle caring men observing the camp from over a grade
the men sneak back down the hill the way they came
where about twenty four regulators are waiting for them on horseback all of the riders heads are covered by flour sacks with eyes and mouth holes cut out
some carry torches all carry rifles or shotguns
spencer mounts his horse
big daddy issues orders astride his steed
now unless they start shootin first nobody shoot em
thats way too simple for these jokers
were gonna whip that nigger lover to death
and im gonna personally strip and clip that garboon myself
having said his blood thirsty words he puts the flour sack over his head
he tussles with the sack for a bit then from inside the sack damn i cant see fuckin shit outta this thing
he sticks his fingers in the
eye holes and rips trying to make the holes bigger he only succeeds in making visibility more obscured
we ready or what
hold on im fuckin with my eye holes
i just made it worse
it off his head in frustration
i cant see shit either
who made this goddamn shit
well make you own goddamn masks
look nobodys saying they dont appreciate what jenny did
well if all i hadda do was cut a bag i could cut it better then this
how bout you robert can you see

but when i start ridin the bag starts moving all over and im riding blind
randy tears at his bag
oh shit i just made mine worse
he puts it on then says yep its worse
he yanks it off his head
did anybody bring any extra bags
no no one brought a extra bag
im just asking

shitfire if you dont wear em as you ride up that just defeats the purpose
redfish fatter then some but not all takes off his bag
i cant see in this fucking thing
i cant breathe in this fucking thing
and i cant ride in this fucking thing
fuck all yall

i watched my wife work all day gettin thirty bags ready for you ungrateful sonsabitches

willard rides off

i tole yo to keep quiet
theyre asleep not dead
but willards riding off
look lets not forget why were here
we gotta killer nigger over that hill
and we gotta make a lesson outta em
okay im confused are the bags on or off
robert takes off his bag and says i think we all think the bags was a nice idea
but not pointing any fingers they could of been done better
so how bout no bags this time but next time we do the bags right and then we go full regalia
everyone takes off their bag
wait a minute i didnt say no bags
but nobody can see
so it would be nice to see
goddamit this is a raid
i cant see you cant see so what
all that matters is can the fuckin horse see
thats a raid
spencer puts on his sack everyone else reluctantly does as well
the thirty riders all with sacks over their heads come riding over the hill hooting and hollerin
since nobody can see they ride haphazard into each other
redfish falls off his horse hard on his fat ass
they surround the camp and when the sleeping schultz and django dont react they know somethings up
but since nobody can see everybody and everybodys horse is
over their heads where are they i cant see they tricked us did somebody fall where the hell are they yall redfish fell off his horse hes kinda hurt bad
then amongst the confusion
on the other side of the lake then quickly cut into the tree
till were in a cu of dr
schultz with a scope sight rifle up to his eye
the yellow covered sticks of dynamite protruding from the ground are inside the scope sight circle horse hooves step around it
schtjltz and django up in a tree
schultz auf wiedersehen
the camp explodes blowing horses and riders apart
schultz and django lift up repeating rifles
schultz let em have it
i cant see nothin
schultz just fire into the smoke
the two treetop killers let loose with rifle fire
horses and men trip over bodies and pieces of bodies of horses and men
men with legs and arms blown off yell bloody murder hurt and scared horses cry
some struggle to get the sacks off their heads while scared horses dance and buck in panic
some are shot by the rifle fire
the rest of the men not blown up and still on horseback between the sacks and the smoke still cant see worth a damn
and men and horses collide with one another which causes more bucking and riders falling
about fifteen of the men who can still ride high tail it the fuck out of there
whipped and whimpering like dogs
on his horse with the other fleeing regulators rides for his life
we see the back of the fleeing bennett smack dab in the cross hairs
scope sight rifle up to his eye
schultz next to him says dr
schultz hes getting away
i got em
his hooves race and rip up the grass
riding for his life
scope sight rifle up to his eye
schultz hes getting out of range
i got em
insert a black finger squeezes the rifle trigger
were behind him as he rides away off screen we hear the whistling of what sounds like an incoming missle
front of spencer bennett as he rides when djangos bullet rips through his chest
i got em
falls from his horse dead
scope sight rifle in his hand big smile on his face looks
schultz like that huh
referring to the scope sight rifle i like
schultz well i think while they take this opportunity to lick their wounds we should take this opportunity to get the fuck out of tennessee
they hop out of the tree
schultz in a big city buying django a new saddle
django gets his first initial d etched into it
the men go to different stores to purchase djangos wardrobe
the outfit bought is selected by django with suggestions offered by schultz
when hes done django looks damn handsome in his new duds
brown cowboy boots green corduroy jacket smokey grey shirt tan skin tight pants and light brown cowboy hat
he looks a
bit like elvis in flaming star and a little joe cartwright on bonanza
however tellingly he keeps ace specks winter coat as his winter coat
django sitting on his new saddle in his new duds rides alongside the good doctor schultz
the german carries a picnic basket
schultz but im serious son greenville is just too dangerous for you to go fucking around there
youre a freed slave you should be in new york
you shouldnt be in greenville you shouldnt even be forty miles on any side of greenville
you shouldnt be anywhere in mississippi
shes my wife its my job to look after her
if greenvilles where i gotta go to find out where she went then i gotta go
now you were sayin where i gotta go first
schultz thereshould be some sort of records office
you know when she was sold you know where she came from the carrucan plantation and you know her name
what is her name
nods his head yes
schultz were her owners german
now django reacts how did he know that
yeah how did you know
she wasnt born on the carrucan plantation
she was raised by a german mistress the von shafts
she can speak a little german too
schultz your wife
yeah when she was little her mistress taught her so shed have somebody to talk german with
schultz so let me get this straight your slave wife speaks german and her name is broomhilda von shaft
schultz to say the least
stopping the horse this looks like a very pretty place to have our picnic
whatd ya say here
the two men sit on a blanket with a nice picnic spread spread out
django eats a cucumber sandwich with the crust cut off and drinks a cup of tea
how did you know broomhildas first masters were german
schultz broomhilda is a german name
if they named her it stands to reason theyd be german
lotsa gals where you from named broomhilda
schultz no not so much
broomhilda is the name of a character in one of the most popular of all the german legends
theres a story bout broomhilda
schultz yes there is
do you know it
schultz every german knows that story
would you like me to tell you
django nods his head yes
schultz well broomhilda was a princess
she was the daughter of wotan the god of all gods
anyway her father is really mad at her
what she do
schultz i dont exactly remember
i think she disobeys him in some way
so at first hes just going to obliterate her obliterate
what does that mean
schultz like blow up
he pantomimes a explosion
phew thats pretty mad
schultz yes it is and like most fathers given a little time he calms down a bit
hes still mad at her
he still wants to punish her
blow her up
so instead what he does is he puts her high on top of a mountain
broomhildas on a mountain
schultz its a german legend theres always going to be a mountain in there somewhere
so he puts her on top of the mountain and he puts a fire breathing dragon there to guard the mountain
then he surrounds her in circle of hellfire
and there broomhilda shall remain unless a hero arises brave enough to save her
does a fella arise
from now on as dr
schultz talks hes beginning to realize something he wasnt aware of when the conversation started
schultz yes django as a matter he does
a fella named sigfried
does sigfried save her
schultz yes he does and quite spectacularly so
now true he is assisted in his triumph by a truly truly remarkable sword still having said that sigfried triumphs over all of his obstacles not just due to his
sword but due to his courage
he scales the mountain because hes not afraid of it
he defeats the dragon because hes not afraid
schultz cont he walks through hellfire because broomhildas worth
after that last line of dialogue
the two men just let a moment pass as they nibble on their sandwiches
i know how he feels
schultz i think im just starting to realize that
he pours django and himself some more tea out of a fancy tea pot as he thinks about what hes going to say next
schultz look django i dont doubt one day you will save your lady love
but im afraid i cant let you go to greenville in a good conscious
let me ask you a question how do you like the bounty hunting business
kill white folks and they pay ya
whats not to like
schultz i hafta admit we make a good team
but ithought you were mad at me for killin big john and rodger
schultz yes on that occasion you were a tad overzealous
but normally thats a good thing
howd you like to partner up for the winter
whatd ya mean partner up
schultz you be my deputy for real this time
a lot of the big money is in outlaw gangs
some of these fellas are worth fifteen hundred or three thousand a piece
with one man anything over three men is a risk
but with a partner
creating cross fire
its fish in a
a lot of these gangs hold up in thehills for the winter
you makin another agreement
you work with me through the winter till the snow melts
i give you a third of my bounties
and while were together ill teach you a few things youre going to need to know
can you teach me how to make tony do that head bow thing that fritz can do
schultz that among other things
we make some money this winter when the snow melts ill take you to greenville myself and well find where they sent your wife
im pretty good at finding people
is it a deal
no white man has ever done anything for django just to him
so understandably hes a little suspicious
why you care what happens to me
why you care if i find my wife
schultz well frankly ive never given anybody their freedom before
and now that i have i feel vaguely responsible for you
youre just not ready to go off on your own its that simple
youre too green youll get hurt
plus when a german meets a real life sigfried
its kind of a big deal
as a german im obliged to help you on your quest to rescue your beloved broomhilda
django accepts that response
what follows is a montage covering the five months that django and schultz partner up as bounty hunters
schultz wears his normal ensemble
django wears his cool looking green jacket unless its really cold which a lot of this montage is
then he still wears ace specks raw hide winter coat over his cool clothes
a scene to be improvised more or less where dr
schultz teaches django how to draw and shoot the pistol in the holster at his hip
by the end of the scene after trial and error we see djangos going to be good at this
we see django and dr
schultz walking up a hill
tony and fritz have been left tied up downhill
django leads a extra body horse named poncho behind him
schultz carries his scope sight rifle in a long case
they get to the top of the hill
it overlooks a small farmhouse
a little man struggling behind a plow and his fifteen year old son helping him by leading the horse forward
on top of their perch on the hill top dr
schultz says dr
schultz keep down or hell see you
who that farmer
schultz well since we came here to kill em he just might
the little man pushin that plow
schultz that little man pushing that plow is smitty bacall
smitty bacall is a farmer
smitty bacall is a stagecoach robber whos hiding out as a farmer because theres a seven thousand dollar bounty on his head
he hands django the scope rifle case
schultz and hes all yours my boy
django lays on his belly with the scope sight up to his eye
on the farmer struggling behind his plow working hard with his horse and his son
djangos finger on the trigger
but he hesitates
schultz oh what happened
to mister i wanna kill white folks for money
his sons with him
hell have a loved one with him
maybe even share a last word
thats better then most get and a damn
sight better then he deserves
django still hesitates
schultz put down the rifle
dont worry im not mad at you
take out smitty bacalls handbill
django removes the folded up handbill from the pocket of his tan pants
schultz read it aloud
consider it todays lesson
wanted dead or alive
smitty bacall and the smitty bacall gang
for murder and stagecoach robbery
seven thousand dollars for smitty bacall
one thousand and five hundred dollars for each of his gang members
known members of the smitty bacall gang are as follows dandy michaels gerald nash and dr
schultz well done
that is who smitty bacall is
if smitty bacall wanted to start a farm at twenty two they would never of printed that
but smitty bacall wanted to rob stagecoaches and he didnt mind killing people to do it
you want to save your wife by doing what i do
this is what i do
i kill people and sell their corpses for cash
his corpse is worth seven thousand dollars
now quit your pussyfootin and shoot him
the little man down below behind the plow falls down
the young boy doesnt know what happened at first
then he figuresout his father was just shot
he goes to him in the dirt
schultz you need to keep that smitty bacall handbill
schultz its good luck
you always keep the handbill of your first bounty
they begin walking down the hill to collect smitty bacalls body leading the extra body horse behind them
as they walk down hill they watch the little scene of smitty bacalls son cradling his dying father
in his arms the older man speaking his last words to his son before he dies
schultz see theyre having a tender little father son moment now
no doubt the most heartfelt one theyve ever had
its now full on snowy winter in the hills
django practices his quick draw against a snowman hes built
he sticks a bottle in it so the bottom of the bottle is where the snowmans heart would be
shoots the bottle heart
shoots the left coal eye
shoots the right coal eye
shoots the carrot nose
schultz comes up behind him
schultz i think its safe to say youre faster then the snowman
a outlaw gang known as the wilson lowe gang five guys ride through a snowy forest at night
when all five men and their horses are shot up in a tree firing down on them
the flakes continue to fall hard as dr
schultz and django ride down the main street of town pulling poor poncho whos fully loaded down with five corpses
the local sheriff don gus watches the two men ride up he knows them
doctor and django how the hell are ya and who the hell ya got there
schultz the wilson lowe gang
who the hells the wilson lowe gang
schultz removes a handbill from his inside jacket pocket and hands it down to the friendly peace officer
schultz bad chuck wilson and meaner bobby lowe
and three of their acolytes
just leave em out here they aint going nowhere
and ifin they do god must love em so who are we to say
come outta the snowy snow and git yourself some coffee
the snow encrusted bounty hunters come inside the lawmans office
they exchange pleasantries about the weather as the sheriff pours them coffee
after the two frosty gentlemen have drunk some of the hot liquid they get down to business
as schultz and gus discuss the bounties django reads the handbills aloud from off the wall
on the third one he reads warren vanders and a two thousand dollar bounty that one schultz says
django rips it off the wall
as the winter has progressed we see theyve become a genuine bounty hunting team
and django a genuine bounty hunter
the snow has melted and its spring
and inside of this meadow django practices his fast draw against five men
by schultz throwing five coins in the air
django draws fast shoots three coins fires again hitting another then falls to the ground to get the fifth
he looks up from the ground at schultz
as schultz collects the coins off the ground he says dr
schultz youre pretty confident arent you
django nods his head yes
schultz you have reason to be
he holds out his fist opens his hand the coins lay in his palm
all the coins have bullet holes dead in their center
he drops them on top of django
still think im too green for greenville
schultz removes a pipe sticks it in his mouth and says dr
schultz oh youre ready for greenville
he lights a match then lights the pipe puffing as he says dr
schultz greenville ready for you that im not so sure
he blows out the match
what we also saw in the above montage is django shake off a lifetime of slavery
django in his green jacket in his cowboy hat on top of his steed tony with his gun hanging from his hip has become his own man
hes not a slave anymore
hes a bounty hunter
across the screen one letter at a time style ala rocky and the whole main street of greenville is thick with five inches of shit brown mud that all the
horse hooves and wagon wheels and slave feet have to wade through to get from one end of the town to the other
we see django and dr
schultz enter the town and slosh their horses in the mud down the main street of greenville mississippi
the buying and selling of slaves is what the whole town is built around
black men women and children in bondage are everywhere you look
lines of chained slaves being marched one way or the other move through the muddy streets of greenville
white men on horses move them along
buckboards filled with domestic slaves house niggers and pretty ponys driven by white men roll through the street
a young white boy years old a shepherd leads a bunch of slave children through town
a shepherds dog helps him out by moving impromptu slave auctions take place on almost every block
a subtitle appears on the bottom of the screen dr
schultz takes in this african flesh market where human beings sell other human beings with disgust and a little bit of shock
django is neither disgusted or
shocked he knows first hand how greenville operates
as he rides tony through town in his snappy duds he looksat the black men half dressed in chains
he remembers himself with his six other companions from earlier being walked through the mud of main street by the speck brothers
on that day he might as well of been a steer
today with a gun on his hip money in his pocket in his snappy outfit astride his steed tony he feels so different from these wretched half naked bastards it
gives him a bit of a chill
django sees the towns railroad depot and across from it a huge slave pen like a steer corral
at the moment theres no train in the depot
the train at a earlier time pulling into the depot
amidst a boxcar full of shirtless black males django watches the train pull into the station from inside the wooden slates of the boxcar
a hatch in the roof of the boxcar is noisily yanked open and two white slave traders russ and judd peer down at their human cargo
good god almighty these niggers stink
niggers stink wheres the shock
to the slaves okay you bucks listen up and listen well im only gonna say this once
theres a slave corral right across from this boxcar
we gittin ready to open these doors
when we do yall run as fast as you can right into that pen
anyone gittin off trail gonna get hurt and hurt bad
now you niggers better comprehend
and that goes for any african garboons amongst yall cant understand english
your american buddies better shove your ass in the right direction or your trip to this country is going to be short and pointless
train to pen as fast as you can
the boxcar door is slid open and a hundred and fifty black males run full out from the train to the steer corral
we spot django during the running
once inside the corral the gate is closed
cowboys with rifles act as prison guards
through the wooden posts in the distance django watches them open up the boxcar holding the females
they do their run to their pen out of view
django catches a quick glimpse of broomhild
a running with the other ladies then shes gone from view
django and dr
schultz on top of their horses taking in the sight of greenville
schultz its a spectacle out of dante
you should see it from the other side
schultz frankly i dont know if i could endure this
youd be surprised what you can endure
schultz records office
schultz and django walk into a records office lined with books
we watch through the store front window the black man and white man enter and dr
schultz present his business card to a dickensian looking records office worker
as schultz starts his spellbinding with words routine
the camera fades to black
the same shot we saw before of django fighting his way to the bars of the slave pen to get a better last look of broomhilda
broomhilda as before is walked by in the distance
then as before django loses sight of her
we follow in front of broomhilda being lead out of the slave pen by two white male slavers
her bare feet slosh in the main street mud and the leg irons scrap her ankles
up until now everything youve ever seen of broomhilda has only been in djangos spaghetti western flashbacks
in other words from his perspective and memory
this is the only time the story will shift to broomhildas perspective
the strong but frightened girl is led out on to the hustle and bustle and wagon wheels and horse hoofs of main street
broomhilda is not taken into that three story auction arena that django was sold in at the beginning
instead shes just lifted up on a parked buckboard wagon
her seller clyde starts his pitch on the twelve or so buyers that watch this puny make shift auction
looks down into the crowd of twelve ugly white men and holds her breath which one will buy her
among the ugly white men we see mr
harmony mike not quite as ugly as the rest
an older well dressed classy gentleman
next to him is his twenty four year old overweight awkward son scotty harmony
scotty in the audience and broomhilda on the wagon their eyes meet he nudges his dad
the seller makes her expose her breasts to the small crowd
then her back revealing her whip marks
then pointing out the runaway r branded in her cheek
some of the crowd including scotty react with repulsion at the sight of the whip marks
the seller assures the crowd that niggers dont feel pain like white folks and it only makes the women more gentle
fellahs you aint felt gentle till you felt nigger gal gentle
makes a bid
makes leap frog big bid
makes a bid
makes a bid
make a bid
makes a bid
harmony makes a bid for his son scotty
broomhilda notices that
and makes more eye contact with scotty
they look at each other as mr
harmony continues to bid
a literary narrator comes on the soundtrack
on that day eight months ago the auction was won by mike harmony as a birthday present for his fat boy son scotty
harmony congratulates his son
from on top of the buckboard broomhilda looks down at her new owners
later they leave for the harmony house
scotty lifts broomhilda up into the back of the buckboard
he hands her a little white bag
this is for you
she opens the bag candies of many colors sit in it
theyre jelly beans
she selects a yellow one and puts it in her mouth
she nods her head yes
we see him drive the buckboard out of greenville with broomhilda in the back eating her bag of jelly beans
the buckboard makes its way down a country road
broomhilda in the back and scotty driving the wagon
scotty bought her but hes too scared to talk to her
broomhildas muddy bare feet dangle off the wagon
shes beginning to realize the young master is the shy type
im lonely back here
can i come on up with you on that seat so we can talk
please id love that
she climbs into the drivers seat
in more ways then one
a nice two story southern house
very nice but hardly a plantation
the households four domestic slaves
broomhilda will be the fifth
the buckboard pulls up to the front of the house
scottys mother mrs
harmony mary louise waits to meet her son and his new bought nigger gal
the older lady looks the black girl up and down and says to her mrs
harmony whats your name gal
harmony follow me
into the kitchen to her son you stay out here
harmony brings broomhilda in her kitchen
the two domestic slaves that were in there are chased out by the boss lady
harmony grabs broomhilda by the wrist and tells her mrs
harmony i want to have a word with you wench
you met my boy scotty
you can tell aint no white girl gonna fool with him
and if they do fool with him they fool with him for the wrong reason
boys twenty four he still aint a man yet
thats why youre here
be nice to him
hes a very sweet boy
play him right hell eat bird seed out of your palm
play em wrong youll deal with me
i like scotty
hes just shy is all
all he needs is a little confidence
harmony and youll give that to him
ill do my best mam
scottys a real sweet boy
harmony he is isnt he
the mother lets go of the young ladys wrist
basically the harmonys bought a slave bride for young master scotty that day
and the two kids had a nice time playing house for awhile
we see scotty and broomhilda catching butterflies in butterfly nets in the daytime
at night they catch lightning bugs together
at night in scottys bed while the young man lay fast asleep broomhilda looks at her jelly jar of glowing lightning bugs
as scottys sort of defacto sweetheart if no visitors were about broomhilda would even join the family at their dinner table
we see them at dinner eating fried chicken and mashed potatoes and gravy
and pretty soon she was adopted into a member of the family
harmony and broomhilda sewing together
the harmony family and broomhilda playing croquet in the front yard
after dinner mrs
harmony entertaining the family by playing the piano
harmony reading the women and his son a story from a storybook
scotty was never happier
scotty and broomhilda walking holding hands at southern magic hour
broomhilda having sex with scotty baby talking with him talking him through it making him feel loved and secure
after three months of this bliss scotty decided to take broomhilda for a romantic weekend in greenville
drive through the main street of greenville dressed to the nines in a fancy carriage
broomhilda dressed in a beautiful white lace dress complete with white lace gloves fancy ladies hat and white parasol
scotty very proud of his pretty pony is dressed in a fashion best described as plantation pimp daddy
white masters would take their pretty ponys to greenville for a treat or romantic excursion for two reasons one seeing how bad the other slaves had it always made the
papered ponys appreciate their privilege position just in case theyd forgot
holding her parasol looking like a black daisy miller watches the other slaves march by in the mud
they watch her too
broomhilda and scotty and their luggage move into the fancy hotel lobby and rent a room at the front desk
scotty signs his name
the desk clerks hand checks the box on the registry book that indicates darkee female companion
greenville at night is a little different
at night rich white masters showing off their ponys like scotty rule the streets
and two there was a sliver of society that ran through greenville at night that catered to white masters who were infected with a condition that was normally referred to
as nigger love
at night the streets the bars bistros and buggy rides were ruled by rich white masters showing off their pretty ponys
an establishing shot
of the three story house that has been converted into private club called the cleopatra club
but the crown jewel of all this interracial frivolity was the members only cleopatra club
with the name the cleopatra club on it next to it is a profile of nefertiti
the interracial joint is jumping as long as by interracial you mean white men and black women
scotty and broomhilda are enjoying a fancy dinner in the clubs dining room
we see across the dining room the powerful white man calvin candie sitting with some white men and some black ponys eyeing broomhilda
i gotta tell you broomhilda i dont care if i go to
hell for this i love you
and if loving you means i go to hell
well then hello mr
that was actually kind of funny
broomhilda was right all he needed was a little confidence
she puts her hand on his
speak of the devil and the devil appears
appears at their table
hello my name is calvin candie i own the cleopatra club
and i would just like to welcome an attractive couplelike yourselves to my favorite place on earth
scotty stands up and shakes hands with calvin
thank you so much its a great honor
we love it here
pointing at a empty chair
may i join you
please by all means
calvin sits down
broomhilda gets a sinister chill from this smiling jack
scotty as per usual is clueless
how long have you been a member
we just joined this weekend
well our little private oasis appreciates your patronage
some may consider the dues excessive but theyre necessary for us to create this haven for the alternative lifestyle weve all become accustomed to
well said and money well spent
he squeezes broomhildas hand
candie sees this
it would be
my pleasure your first weekend at the club to join me and my friends at my table
broomhilda knows this is a man to be avoided
but scotty is swept away being courted by somebody like calvin candie
she tries to imply they should stay where they are
he brushes her off with a dont be silly
we see calvin introduce his table of friends to the couple and they join the party
calvin candie has his arm around a foxy pony named sheba whose dress is a little more revealing then the others
they drink and talk and the white men have a forced good time
but calvin candie cant hide his sinister side from broomhilda and it keeps her uncomfortable until she excuses herself from the table to go to bed
scottys having such a good time with his fancy friends he opts to stay behind
broomhilda leaves in a bit of a huff due to scottys disobedience
if these fancy
fucking white men werent around making scotty feel so puffy chested hed never dismiss her that way
we follow broomhilda out of the club across the street to the hotel
after excusing herself she walked across the street to her hotel room
she got her white dress dirty in the mud but she didnt care the night was ruined anyway
some romantic weekend
wait till she gets home and tells his mother how he ignored her
shell fix his fat ass
wait till he asks her to scratch his back next time
shes gonna scrape every pimple
back at the cleo club the now drunk scotty is playing poker with calvin and his friends
back at the cleopatra club as the night wore on calvin candie suggesteda friendly card game
as the game wore on it came down to a two thousand dollar pot between calvin candie and scotty harmony
luckily for him scotty was holding
a inside straight
calvin holds his cards with sheba draped around him
she whispers something in his ear
you know what sheba just tole me
scotty thinking about his great hand says what
she says she thinks youre cute
thank you sheba i think youre beautiful
sheba whispers something else in candies ear
sheba says shed like to give you a little lip
want some lip
scotty is a little surprised
well shes your pony
oh hush whats a little nigger lip tween friends
go on honey give em some sugar
sheba walks over to scottys side of the table and gives him a very lip intensivesoul kiss
the table enjoys the show
then sheba goes back to calvins side of the table
the game continues
okay loverboy i think youre trying to out brazen me in my own club and i wont have it
if youre really holding cards time to pony up
i raise you five hundred
candie throws in his chips
i see your five hundred
throws in chips and raise you four hundred more
tosses his last chips call
this is where calvin candie has waited to be all night
not so fast boy
pot aint fat enough yet
im all in
aint that too bad
scotty doesnt intend to let this smiling jack cheat him out of his pot especially with him holding an inside straight
i would think a southern gentleman of such renown as yourself wouldnt have to resort to buying a pot in his own club
calvin writes on a piece of paper then throwsitin the pot
one final raise
scotty takes the piece of paper whats this
its shebas bill of sale
i dont want her
and the whole table laugh at that
you sure didnt look like you didnt want her
in greenville slaves are currency
and shebas worth about eight hundred dollars
im throwing sheba in the pot
match or fold
im all out of money
but we aint playin for money no more
we matchin nigger gals
and a nigger gal you got
i cant bet broomhilda
in chickasaw county shes money
pony her up or fold
somebody get him a piece of paper and a pencil
write out a bill of sale or fold them cards
scotty makes a pressured decision
he hurriedly takes the pencil and writes out a bill of sale for broomhilda
let me see your cards
candie lays down his cards he has a flush
what scottys just done hits him like a ton of bricks
you cheated me
after scotty uses the c word everybody quiets down
what did you just call me
i called you a card cheatin son of a bitch cause thats what you are
calvin calmly stands up from the table
he removes a small derringer gun
from his pocket and tosses it on the table in front of scotty
then takes out another one and tosses it on the table in front himself
everybody in the cleo club quiets down
for calling me a card cheat in my own club as a southern gentleman i challenge you to a duel
to the piano piano player will you hit three separate notes
on the third note pick up the gun and try to kill me
to piano player piano player please
this is all going too fast for slow scotty
wait a minute
i aint dueling with you
i dont want to duel
then get out of here get in your buggy and get out of town
let me just get my girl
you lost that girl fat boy
candie im sorry i called you a cheat
i cant give you broomhilda
last chance fat boy go home and getuseta to fuckin another one
or pick up that gun
scotty cant leave
he cant go home without her
he cant face his parents
he cant walk out on her
no matters what happens he cant leave
calvin candie shoots scotty harmony dead
calvin candie and his entourage enter the hotel lobby and go up to the hello oliver
candie good evening
good evening to you as well
could you please inform me which room your guest scott harmony is staying in
broomhilda is asleep in bed
calvin comesbursting in the room holding his belt in his hand
he yanks off the sheets that broomhilda sleeps under
broomhilda lies naked under the covers
candie brings the belt down around her legs and backside
she hops out of bed
candie chases her naked body with his belt from the top of the stairs down the stairs and through the lobby and out the front door
all to the amusement of the white hotel guests
she runs out of the hotel naked and then trips falling into the greenville mud
she looks up from the mud at calvin candie looking down at her
welcome to candyland
we do a slow zoom into broomhildas face
that was four months ago
back inside the three story auction block domed room
the same room django was sold in at the beginning
tons of white buyers and sellers and black slaves to be bought or sold fill the big hall
stands half naked on the auction block
the seller shelby gives the crowd a sales pitch about banjo and starts the bidding
many different ugly white men make bids on the big mandingo including calvin candie
schultz and django from a pair of opera glasses
watch calvin candie from up above on the nd floor landing
schultzs perspective we see calvin candie and his black slave
bodyguard bartholomew always dressed in a slightly ill fitting three piece suit and bowler hat among the crowd of buyers at the auction block below
candies lawyer leonide moguy joins him
schultz his name is calvin candle and he is the owner of candyland
the mandingo fightin place
schultz oh so you heard of it
aint no slave aint heard of candyland
schultz well apparently thats where your wife is and apparently the repellent gentleman down there is the one who owns her
i i time cut the white man and black man find a cubby hole to talk in the auction hall
schultz how much do you know about mandingo fighting
not so much
master carrucan had a couple niggers hed fight
schultz can you play a mandingo expert
schultz can you convincingly masquerade as someone who is an expert on mandingo fighters
schultz because when a man has one of the four biggest cotton plantations in dixie but the only thing that seems to ring his chimes is big sweaty black males
if we want to get his attention we better be talking about big sweaty black males
so my character is that of a big money buyer from dusseldorf here in greenville to buy my way into the mandingo fight game
and your character is the mandingo expert i hired to help me do it
they call that one eyed charly
one eyed charly
thats what you call it when you buy a slave expert
if you wanna raise horses but dont know nothin about horses you buy yourself a one eyed charly who knows about horses
he teaches ya
you wanna plant tobacco but dont know nothin about it you buy yourself a one eyed charly knows about tobacco
schultz why do they call it one eyed charly
you know back on the plantation my
job wasnt historian
its an unusual name
thats a perfectly legitimate question
so can you convincingly play my mandingo one eyed charly
dont say yes if you cant
you want me to play a black slaver
there aint nothin lower then a black slaver
black slavers are lower then head house niggers and buddy thats pretty fuckin low
schultz then play him that way
give me your black slaver
django gets that
schultz can you do that
that i can do
schultz to get ourselves personally invited to candyland by calvin candie himself
schultz and django stand across the street from the cleopatra club
which looks like aregular nice three story house among other
nice houses on an affluent residential block in greenville mississippi
they open the tiny garden gate in front of the house walk up the stoop steps to the front door
they ring the doorbell
a pretty young black girl dressed in a french maid outfit opens the door
schultz bonjour mon petite femme noire
we are here to see calvin candie
shes been taught to smile and say enter
the two men walk into the entrance way of the house
a beautiful mulatto hostess greets the two men
hello gentlemen im cleo can i help you
schultz hands cleo the guest card
schultz yes i am dr
king schultz and this is my associate django freeman
upon hearing django is a free man her eyes go to him
schultz were here for a appointment with calvin candie and leo moguy
yes you gentlemen are expected
please make yourself comfortable
ill inform monsieur candie youve arrived
referring to the can coco get either of you two gentlemen a tasty refreshment
schultz not at the moment
then coco will entertain you while i inform monsieur candie
schultz how charming
django wanders over the dining room and peers inside
a lush fancy restaurant dining area inside of this house
the diners are made up exclusively of well dressed white men and pretty black girls ponys dressed in the most elaborate ladies fashions of the day
some appear to be on dates
some appear to be enjoying a special evening birthday anniversary special treat
two men with two women
some are one man with two or three or more women
the white mens ages range from early twenties to old men
the girls ages ranges from their twenties to thirteen
the bill of fare is a combination of french cuisine and hearty beef driven american dining
the dolled up decked outponys eat rich french cuisine complete with elaborate sauces and take their knives to thick cuts of steak
the younger little girls usually eat ice cream with hot fudge banana splits and cookies
while all the men drink whiskey or wine the girls all drink sarsaparilla
schultz quietly moves next to django and asks dr
schultz have you ever seen anything like this before
django shakes his head no
yall gonna dine its real good
you like catfish we got good catfish
they use alotta butta
you like sand dabs we got sand dabs
leo moguy descends from the clubs prominent staircase
schultz good to see you again
moguy thank you for your assistance in creating the opportunity for this appointment
moguy nonsense its my job
moguy so thisis the one eyed charly ive heard so much about
schultz yes this is django
django this is mr
candies lawyer leonidemoguy
just call me leo
calvins in the billiard room follow me
yall want coco should come along too
schultz we would be quite lucky indeed if the charming coco cared
you better watch out doctor you gonna steal this little ponys heart
they walk through the club to get to the billiard room as they do they dr
schultz how long have you been associated with mr
calvin and i were about eleven when we went to boarding school together
one could almost say i was raised to be calvins lawyer
one could almost say you a nigger
coco cant believe what this snappy looking cowboy nigger just said to mr
what did you say
schultz oh nothing hes just being cheeky
anything else about mr
candie i should know before i meet him
yes hes a bit of a francophile
schultz what civilized people arent
thats why all the french ambiance
and he prefers monsieur candie to mister candie
schultz says in french subtitled in english dr
schultz what ever he prefers
this stops moguy and he turns to warn schultz
oh he doesnt speak french
dont speak french to him itll embarrass him
they get to the two sliding doors that lead to the billiard room
moguy slides the doors open
the party enters the billiard room
inside is calvin candie his bodyguard bartholomew still dressed in the ill fitting suit and the lanky sexy sheba
also at this moment two mandingos are having a bloody and savage fight to death in this closed room
an older european looking man whos rooting for the mandingo that calvins not rooting for is also in the room
his name is
amerigo before any introductions can be made with his back to the new arrivals and his eyes on the black men fighting for their life calvin says why do you
want to get in the mandingo business
thats quite abrupt and aggressive
schultz says as if hes just been massively insulted dr
schultz you dont intend to allow your nd
referring to moguy to make the proper introductions
without turning towards them candie tells schultz quit stalling and answer the question
the room is quiet
schultz the awful truth
im bored and it seems like a good bit of fun
candie takes that to heart
hell accept it for now
well come on over cause we gotta us a fight goin on thats a good bit of fun dr
schultz steps up to get a better look at the savage fight
the bigger mandingo is really hurting the smaller one
schultz has schooled django on the importance of never breaking character
well now the good doctor must practice what he preaches
which means not only must he watch
the two men beat each other to death he must appear to convincingly enjoy it
the bigger nigger is mine
i just bought him today
whats his name moguy
the other nigger belongs to this disreputable italian gentlemen to my right
whats your niggers name
candie looks over at django who doesnt walk over to watch the fight
instead he walks over to a bar set up in the room
a slave bartender named roscoe tends it
how bout you boy
you find nigger fightin a good bit of fun
you seen one nigger fight ya seen em all
howd you two like to try the signature drink of the club
schultz wed love to
yelling to the roscoe two polynesian pearl divers and dont spare the rum
roscoe makes the drinks in coconut shell glasses
big fred kills luigi
candie and his friends cheer
vassepi looks like you owe me ten dollars
amerigo pays up the puny bet
django and schultz get the fancy coconut shell drinks
they both take a sip
schultz hates it django loves it
candle turns his attention to django
whats your name boy
schultz his name is django
whered ya dig him up
schultz a fortuitous turn of events brought django and myself together
ive heard tell about you
i heard youre a real bright boy
im curious what makes you such a mandingo expert
im curious what makes you so curious
bartholomew puts down his pool cue and turns toward django what you say boy
candie puts a calming hand on bartholomews shoulder
calm down bartholomew gentle
schultz monsieur candie i would appreciate it if you directed your line of inquiry to me
doc im a seasoned slaver you are a neophyte
im simply trying to ascertain if this cowboy is taking advantage of you
schultz with all due respect monsieur candie i didnt seek you out for your advice
i sought you out to purchase a fighting nigger at above top dollar market price
i wasunder the impression when you granted me an audience it would be to discuss business
no we werent talking business yet
we were discussing my curiosity
now according to moguy here if i do business with you
im doin business with both of yall
he does the eyeballin you the billfold
schultz well you dont make it sound too flattering but more or less yes
none of the white men in the room have any respect for a white man who needs a nigger to tell him what time of day it is
candie turns his attention back to django
so bright boy
moguy here tells me you looked over my african flesh and were none too impressed
django looking over three mandingos
not for top dollar
well then we got nothing more to talk about
you wanna buy a beat ass nigger from me those are the beat ass niggers i wanna sell
he dont wanna buy the niggers you wanna sell
he wants the nigger you dont wanna sell
i dont sell the niggers i dont wanna sell
schultz chimes in thoughtfully dr
schultz you wont sell your best
you wont even sell your second best
but your third best
you dont want to
but if i made you an offer so ridiculous youd be forced to consider it
who knows what could happen
what do you consider ridiculous
for a truly talented specimen the right nigger
how much would you say django
twelve thousand dollars
calvin candle takes in the figure
gentlemen you had my curiosity
now you got my attention
candle moguy django schultz bartholomew sheba and coco eat dinner in the restaurant
all the men eat thick t bones
coco eats catfish
and sheba uses her fingers to rip apart crawdads
how ya like that meat bright boy
djangos eyes go to calvin he nods his approval
hows your catfish dew drop
real good monsieur candie
you spend a lot of time around niggers aside from freeman here
schultz not so much
well ifin you did
youd know what a treat this was for em
you feel special coco
sir monsieur candie
you feel special bartholomew
yes sir monsieur candie
he looks to sheba whos licking her fingers from the crawdads
now sheba always feels special
how bout you bright boy you feel special
not as special as her
the table breaks out in laughter
well were leaving bright and early tomorrow morning and moving the
whole kit and caboodle to candyland
you oughta come with us
schultz and djangos eyes meet for a moment
schultz well that wasnt on the agenda
but i suppose i could be amenable to that
how far must we trek
oh hardly a ride at all well still be in chickasaw county
there you can get a look at my best specimens
have dinner with my sister and i
spend the night at candyland as my guest
django and schultz trade looks and small smiles
its the next day and a whole procession is making their way to candyland
calvin candie leonide moguy dr
schultz django and three overseers billy crash tommy giles and hoot peters ride horses
bartholomew now dressed in work clothes drives a buckboard filled withsupplies
five mandingos big fred and banjo who we already met plus joshua sidney james and tatum recently purchased at the greenville auction walk to their new home with small bundles
of their personal possessions under their arm
they look like powerful warriors
were the mandingos from candyland that didnt sell at greenville are walking back to candyland with their small bundle of personal possessions under their arms
these poor devils know their fate is pretty dismal
either theyll be sold to the lequint dickey mining company or theyll be put in some mandingo fight they cant win like with samson or stonesiphers dogs
walks along the road looks up at django riding his horse
all the slaves hate django because they think hes a black slaver
but the three heading back to candyland are even more resentful
django with schultz earlier inspecting and rejecting these three
gives django a bad eyeball look up on his horse
hes playing the role of a fucker black slaver he cant let that shit stand
he yells down to the powerless man gotta problem with your eyeball boy
rodney looks away
you want a boot heel in it
then keep ya damn eyeballs off me
flash that bad look at me again ill give ya reason not to like me
as this parade makes progress django keeps his emotions in check but not without difficulty
schultz comes riding fritz beside him
schultz how do you like this side of the slave trade
not so much
schultz prefer the other side
i didnt say that
schultz ive confirmed broomhildas at candyland
are you sure its her
schultz he didnt call her by name but shes a young lady whip marks on her back and speaks german
now while its not wise to assume in this instance i think its pretty safe
did you offer to buy her
schultz i opened the door to my possible interest
but naturally sight unseen i can only be so interested
calvin candie comes riding up behind them
am i intruding
schultz of course not
i swear you two are cozier then a couple of cuttle fish
schultz youd be surprised what a good conversationalist django is
oh by now i dont think that would surprise meat all
candie gives django a creepy smile
around now the audience may start noticing dog barking in the distance
schultz when do we reach your property
you been on it
i own the whole sixty miles fore we get to candyland
candie gets annoyed at the barking dogs
excuse me a moment gentlemen
him at billy billy crash git up here
billy crash a hillbilly overseer whos missing his two front teeth rides up
find out what that goddamn commotion is up at the tracker shack
right away boss
billy crash tears up ahead on his horse
you know confidentially just tween us girls worse things about this business aint the slaves
its all the white trash ya gotta deal with
like these peckawoods we got riding with us
these dumb ignorant sleazy sonsabitches aint good fer nuttin except kickin a niggers ass cant kick back
yeah they holdin the pretty part of the whip but its just a thin membrane separate em
and dont think they dont know it either
its about the only thing these dumbass motherfuckers do know
but ya need em
who the hell else ya gonna get to beat a niggers ass other than somebody might as well be a nigger hisself
but these mountain boys i use as trackers for the runaways they the worst
nothin but a buncha goddamn inbreed hillbillies
now like that nigger gal we was talkin bout
im sure it
was a pain in the ass but with a lot of patience that german lady taught hildi how to speak german
django hears her name himself
his head does involuntary jerk but his i emotions betray nothing
now these inbred hillbillies on the other hand they can barely speak english
i cant understand a damn word most of em say
you could teach a plow horse how to make a pot of coffee fore you teach those fools how to use a knife and fork
i tell ya if it wasnt for catchin a nigger on the run theyd be as useless as tits on a boar hog
billy crash comes riding back
what the hells goin on
they got em a runaway
a bunkhouse for the four hillbilly trackers they track down runaway slaves that live here about forty miles from the candyland plantation
a little dog kennel looks like a chicken coup sits next to the bunkhouse
the trackers are a hairy bearded burly buck skinned wearing dirty long haired lot
their leader is mr
stonesipher the other three are stew lex and jake
the four men could be brothers or cousins or father and sons or just from the same hollow
lex holds two snarling german shepherds on a leash
stew one snarling german shepherd on a leash
stonesipher holds one snarling german shepherd on a leash the lead dog that goes by the name of a runaway slave named dartagnan lies belly down in the dirt surrounded
by the four vicious dogs who bark growl and snap at him
one look at dartagnan tells you hes a mandingo whos been in one fight too many
one of his eyes have been poked out
big bites have been bit out of both his face and neck by past fights human bites not the dogs as well as three fingers have been bit off
not to mention hes covered in cuts like hes been drug through a briar patch
the fourth tracker jake doesnt engage in the melodrama
he hangs in the background cutting firewood with a big axe
calvin candie dr
schultz django and the whole candie caravan look down on the runaway slave
including the five new mandingos and the three old mandingos who know dartagnan
well ill be dartagnan
now boy why do a fool thing like run off
i cant fight no more monsieur candie
oh yes you can
you might not be able to win but your ass can fight
stonesipher shut these goddamn dogs up i cant hear myself think
stonesipher yells to marsha mr
stonesipher hush now
marsha hush up
marsha marsha hush up
to the other take these goddamn dogs away from this nigger hes just makin em hungry
the other two yank the dogs away from the fallen black man
how long was he loose
stonesipher spits tobacco juice
half the other night
how far he git off property
stonesipher bout twenty miles off prop
pretty fer considering that limp he got
moguy who was dartagnan suppose to fight friday
pointing behind him one of this new lot
well the way he looks now a blind indian wouldnt bet a bead on em
boy you done made yourself as useless as a tail on a teddy bear
dartagnan starts begging
now now no beggin no playin on my soft heart
you in trouble now son
now you need to understand im runnin a business
now i done paid five hundred dollars for you
and when i pay five hundred dollars i expect to get five fights outta a nigga fore he roll over and play dead
youve fought three fights
i won every one
well yes you did
but that last one you muddied the line between winning and losing
calvin climbs down off of his horse and walks to the captured runaway on the ground
but the fact remains i pay five hundred dollars i want five fights
so what about my five hundred dollars
you gonna reimburse me
the whites except for schultz laugh
this whole spectacle is making dr
schultz sick to his stomach
hes seen this little drama play out many times before
the three returning mandingos rodney chicken charly and chester watch their fellow doomed servant pay the price for running away
the five new mandingos watch calvin candies treatment of dartagnan to know what to expect from their new home
bartholomew on the buckboard looks at the captured runaway like poor bastard
calvin prods further
you even know what reimburse means
the whites laugh
the german speaks dr
schultz ill reimburse you
all eyes turn to dr
including djangos whose eyes narrow at the doctor
calvin candie uses the occasion to perform a slow dramatic turn in the direction of the good german
removing his long brown leather billfold from his suit jacket pocket
youll pay five hundred dollars for a one eyed olejoe aint fit to push a broom
djangos voice cuts through the mississippi heat
no he wont
all eyes turn to django
hes just tiredof you toyin with him is all
and for that matter so am i
but we aint payin a penny for that pickaninny we aint got no use for em
aint that right doc
schultz realizes hes just done the one thing hes always preached to django you can never do
the doctor puts his billfold back in his suit coat pocket
schultz you heard em
the hillbilly trackers stare up at the black man on the horse in the green jacket slack jawed
even the one chopping wood in the bg stops his chopping
youll hafta excuse mr
stonesiphers slack jawed gaze
he aint never seen a nigger like you ever in his life
aint that right mr
stonesipher thats right
calvin steps up to django on his horse
looking up at the black man calvin challenges django to a staring contest
well now since you wont pay a penny for this pickaninny you wont mind me handlin this nigger however i see fit
hes your nigger
let marsha and her bitches send dartagnan to nigger heaven
the other trackers let loose of the leashes holding the german shepherds back
the dogs charge towards dartagnan on his knees
all react to the sight of the dogs being let loose
the dogs attack dartagnan
as we hear the attack
staring contest with django
django who expected nothing less and has seen worse doesnt blink as the runaway slave is torn to bits by canine teeth
the other mandingos are scared sick at what they see
the hillbilly trackers root the dogs on
schultz has never seen a man torn apart by dogs before and he appears not to enjoy it
calvin without blinking shifts his eyes toward dr
schultz then back i
your boss looks a little green around the gills for a blood sport like nigger fightin
as dartagnans screams and marshas growls continue off screen
naw he just aint use to seein a man ripped apart by dogs is all
but you are use to it
well him bein german an all im a little more use to americans then he is
now monsieur candie whenever youre ready we rode five hours so you could show off your stock
lets git to it
cause as of now if hes a example i aint impressed
saying nothing monsieur candie turns his back to django climbs up on his horse then looks at the black man
the whole caravan rides off as the dogs continue to tear dartagnan apart
the caravan starts to approach candyland
calvin candie and his sister own the fourth biggest cotton plantation in the state of mississippi
as the parade gets closer we see fields of cotton and fields of slaves picking it
the audience might of been expecting candyland to be a hell on earth auschwitz andersonville yuma prison a mexican prison in a sergio corbucci spaghetti western
candyland is very beautiful
the fields of cotton the way the trees hang green vines over everything
its full of nature and natures vibrant colors and a broiling hot sun to see it all in
one of the cottonpickers in the field dobie looks up and sees django in his cool green corduroy jacket badass cowboy hat on top of tony
he taps the shoulder of another cotton picker orwell and points out django
all of a sudden all the bent over backs in the field straighten up to get a better look at the black riding a horse
django looks back matching their stare
the caravan rolls through the shack cabin village the slaves live in
as the parade rolls through all the slaves snap to attention and bow very formally as monsieur candie rides past
a king among his subjects a patron with his peons a father amongst his children a shepherd among his sheep
kids playing in the dirt get up and run to calvin on his horse
candie calls the kids by name takes out a bag of jelly beans and begins tossing them about
the kids scramble in the dirt for the bright colored candy
this is calvin candie in his element at his happiest
django rides by
the caravan moves from the slave village to the white village the overseers and their family live in on the plantation grounds
other then the switch of white faces for black its pretty much the same village
and they too see django
the caravan enters the road that leads to the front of the plantation or the big house as everyone calls it
to the left of the big house is big wooden arena built for his friday night nigger fights
all the house slaves the domestic slaves that work for the candie family in the big house and white workers overseers and stray farm hands come out to greet the
they all greet monsieur calvin candie who naturally leads the procession as if hes alexander the great returning from the wars
as the caravan comes to a stop in front of the big house it creates a huge dust cloud behind it
calvins widowed sister lara lee candie fitzwilly an attractive i
fortyish strawberry blonde southern belle steps out on the porch of the big house to greet her brother
directly above lara lee on the third floor balcony over hang out
eyeing calvin and the approaching caravan
stephen is a very old black man who with his bald pate and tufts of white curly hair on the sides looks like a character out of dickens if dickens
wrote about house niggers in the antebellum south
stephen has been calvins slave since he was a little boy
and in almost every way is the nd most powerful person at candyland
like the characters basil rathbone would play in swashbucklers evil scheming intriguing men always trying to influence and manipulate power for their own self interest
well that describes stephen to a tee
the basil rathbone of house niggers
the old man watches the caravan and the trailing dust cloud approach
out of the dust cloud
emerge django and schultz
on tony and fritz
all the candylanders see django dressed like he is up on the horse and for a moment dont know what to think
lara lee like her brother is both surprised and intrigued
as stephen peers down from his perch at the nigger in the green jacket its hate at first sight
stephen heads downstairs he walks with a limp
all the caravan riders are still up on their horses
calvin sees stephen limping towards them and greets him with a big how do you do hello stephen my boy
yeah yeah yeah hello my ass whos this nigger up on that nag
oh stephen why so ornery you miss me
yeah i miss you like i miss
a rock in my shoe

stephen looks up at django on tony

whoa whoa whoa stephen lets keep it funny
djangos a freeman
stephen jerks a thumb up towards django

django this is another cheeky black bugger like yourself stephen
stephen this is django

stephen usesthe special privilege he and he alone enjoys amongst the blacks at candyland

thats my problem theyre mine to burn
your problem right now is making a good impression
and i want you to start solving that problem right now and git them rooms ready
the old man looks up at his master and says yes sir monsieur candie
stephen limps away to the guest rooms muttering tohimself
lara lee and her ever present shadow a fat mammy named cora comes up to her brother on his horse
schultz this attractive southern belle is my widowed sister may i present to you lara lee candie fitzwilly
lara lee does a southern lady bow
schultz lifts his bowler hat and nods in a grand manner
schultz i am dr
king schultz this is my nd django django tips his hat and these are our horses fritz and tony
both fritz and tony do the head bow
schultz and it is our great delight to encounter this flaming rose

these two are in the market for a fightin nigger
so i thought id invite em down show em my stock
well all have dinner tonight right
half the reason i invited them
i thought youd find
them as intriguing as i do little sister
lara lee looks up at django and smiles
all of a sudden three white riders ride up on horses a older one and two tough looking younger ones
theolder one is the capt of the overseers ace woody and his two assistants brown and jingle bells cody
while ace is dressed for work on a farm both brown and jingle bells cody are peacocks who wear cool cowboy outfits
as calvin candie watches the three riders approach he turns to dr
schultz and django and says you know since i started fightin niggers about eleven years ago its been a new lease onlife
and the man ridin up here now is the man responsible for all my success
ace and his boys pull their horses up kicking up dust
through the dust ace brown and jingle bells cody eyeball django and schultz
this here is my overseer
capt and nigger fight trainer extraordinaire ace woody
pointing at the two shadows that flank ace woody
and thats brown and thats jingle bells cody
ace this here is dr
ring schultz and django freeman theyre big customers with big pockets wanna buy a big nigger
so i brought em out here so you could give em a little display of our african flesh
ace takes off his hat bows from his horse welcoming them
welcome to candyland gentlemen
astride their horses brown and jingle bells cody just make faces at django
aces attention goes to the five new mandingos
just walked from greenville to here
these the new chickens
yes siree bob

one two three four five
five real strong bucks

ace looks to see who came back from the auction
leo moguy chimes in i already wired the lequint dickey people theyll be here tomorrow
ace turns to brown
get em away from the others
put em in the pen till tomorrow
brown with his horse yells chases and herds the three men away into the slave pen
ace yells from his horse down to the five new mandingo arrivals big fred banjo sidney james tatum
yall stand over there and make a line
ace climbs down from off his horse
cody stays in his saddle circling the black men with his horse
everybody including django and dr
schultz watch the show
acewoody walks up and down the line looking at the new men
candie sitting comfortably up on his horse says what do you think
i think you lookin for niggers to push a plow dem your boys
candie rolls his eyes
whats wrong with them
hold it you done bought r em let me look at em
unimpressed ace woody continues to examine them
okay how bout that one did you buy that one
what you mean which one
the one im pointing at that one
actually that one was purchased by our mister moguy
you bought him
yes i did
i like his prospects
now you know mr
moguy i aint a educated fella like yourself
remind me again what prospects means
hope for the future
jerking a thumb towards the slave in question
you got hope for his future
well i dont
ace walks over to the slave in question
whats your name boy
the mandingo says sidney james sir
so long sidney james
ace takes the peacemaker out of the holster on his hip and shoots sidney james point blank in the belly
especially the four other mandingos standing next to him
sidney james rolls in the dirt screaming and holding his bleeding gut
till cody puts a bullet in his head putting him out of his misery
moguy shakes his head typical he thinks
django and schultz on their horses next
to candid watch
ace looks up at his boss
boss candie which one did you buy
well to me the pick of the litter is big fred over there
this one over here
a very scared fred answers
well good to meetcha fred imace woody im a man of influence round here
now fred am i mistaken or were you already in a kurfuffle

smiling impressively at big fred
he did have fifteen pounds on em but still he still beat his ass to death
good job boy

ace gives cody a slight head nod and cody shoots big fred in the back
candie acts out mock frustration
the remaining three mandingos jump a mile
now why did you do that
he won his last fight last night
ace puts his eyes on the three remaining mandingos those of you with exceptional ability will find it aint so bad here
those of you who dont possess exceptional ability will wish you did
ace looks up to cody on his horse
run em over to the arena
git em doin push ups
first one gives out shoot em in the head
welcome to candyland boys
cody runs the terrified mandingos to the arena
candie leans over to schultz and says we only get about two out of every batch of five fighters we buy
but those two tend to be lucky
ace woody hops back up on his horse
you know mr
woody im beginning to think that you dont trust my judgement
ace woody just smiles at his boss and says oh you know i always trust your judgement boss candie
he rides off
stephen limps back to the action
ahhh stephen my boy rooms ready
all ready for your guest and his nigger
candieshakes his head in mock frustration
stephen youre incorrigible
gentlemen let stephen show you to your rooms
there you can lie down and rest up for a couple of hours
then well have some lemonade and ill show off some of my finer specimens
schultz and django climb down from their horses
candie looks to a black little stable boy of about eight named timmy
timmy boy go take their horses for em
fix em up at the stable give em a load of oats
django hands the boy the reigns
thats fritz this is tony
you take good care of em now
django takes an apple out of his saddle bag and hands it to the boy
once hes in the stable give em that
he reaches back in the saddle and pulls out another one
give that one to fritz
timmy leads the horses away
the two visitors start to follow stephen to their rooms when dr
schultz pretends to remember something dr
schultz oh monsieur candie about that matter about the nigger girl we were talking about
schultz i believe you said she spoke german
oh yes hildi what about her
schultz do you think before the demonstration you could send her around to my room
i dont see why not
stephen when you get through showing them to their rooms go fetch hildi
i want her cleaned up and smellin nice and sent over to dr
stephen has to be the bearer of bad news
theres somethin we aint tole you yet
hildis in the hot box
this gets djangos schultzs and candies attention
whats she doin there
what cha think she doin in the hot box she bein punished
what she do
she ran away again
jesus christ how many people ran away when i was gone
when did she go
they brought her back this morning
how bad did stonesiphers dogs tear her up
djangos hand falls to the butt of his smoke wagon
if they sicked those dogs on his angel hes going to just kill all these motherfuckers right now
lucky for her they were busy lookin for dartagnans ass
brown and cody went out lookin for her and found her
she a little beat up but she did that to herself
runnin through them damn bushes
djangos hand moves away from his gun
how long she been in the box
whatcha think all goddamn day
little fool got ten more days to go
take her out
take her out
because i said so thats why
hildi is my nigger
schultz is my guest
southern hospitality dictates i make her available to him
but monsieur candie she just ran away
jesus christ stephen whats the point of havin a nigger speaks german if you cant wheel em out when you have a german guest
i realize its inconvenient
still take her out
to cora and lara lee would you and cora be responsible for getting her cleaned up and presentable for dr
the overseers tommy giles and hoot peters go to the hot
while billy crash goes to the well to draw a bucket of water
django watches them walk to the hot box
schultzs eyes shift to django to watch him watch this
stephen notices djangos interest in both the hot box and whoevers sizzling in it
the hot box itself is a large iron solitary confinement cell door from yuma prison built into the ground
they put a key in the lock and the two men lift the heavy iron door open
revealing a naked broomhilda broiling in a small coffin like iron box dug into the ground
broomhilda reacts to the sudden burst of blinding sunshine
billy crash tosses the bucket of water on her
django watches this
from his wide shot perspective we see them yank the naked broomhilda incoherent out of the hole
as we move into a sergio leone cu of djangos face
stephen breaks the mood
you comin or you wanna sleep in that little box
django turns his back on the naked broomhilda and follows stephen and dr
schultz up the front steps of the big house
stephen leads the two guests up the big prominent sweeping staircase in the entry way of the big house
then down the hallway with the guest rooms
schultz is shown his guest room by stephen
schultz enters the room and shuts the door behind him
stephen takes django to the room next door opens the door and leads him in
a guest room with a big feather bed dresser drawer with a flowery pitcher of water and basin on top of it
a little bedside table with a lamp and a tiny bell on it
this ones yours boy
that beds damn nice too
django walks over to the window parts the curtains and peers out
as he looks through the glass snotty stephen rattles on in the background
feel free to touch anything you want cause we burnin all this shit once you gone
ill have somebody knock on the door when the demonstration ready
django sits down on the bed
stephen turns to leave
not so fast
i got more important things to do then jaw with you
nigger when i say stop you plant roots
both the words and the tone stop stephen dead
he turns around
this tiny bell on this little table
is this for you
i ring this you do fer me
me or somebody
django reaches over and picks up the bell
a soft ding a ling what cha want
i want you to pour some water in that bowl for my wash up
stephen does what hes told but with attitude
django shuts the guest room door so the two men are alone
once stephens done django stands up from the bed
stephen hands him the basin full of water
django takes it from him
then throws the water in stephens face
the dripping wet old slave can do nothing against this free man
whatsamatter stephen you dont like that
django takes his hand and slaps the old man hard across the face knocking him to the floor thats my kinda bell ringin
the old man timidly slowly and shaky rises off the floor as soon as he does django slaps him to the floor again
then django sits back down on the bed looking at the old man on the floor below his knees
ive known me house niggers like you my whole life
play your dog tricks with your massa
ya lip off to him every now an then as long as ya keep it funny
he rolls his eyes and puts up with it and all the white folks think its so cute
meanwhile you got all these niggas round here hoppin and jumpin to stay on your good side
well this time snowball you gonna listen to me
you got anymore sass you wanna sling my way before they give us a mandingo demonstration im gonna give this whole motherfuckin plantation a demonstration of me beatin the black
off your ass
i will make you drop your drawers ill take off my belt and i will wup your bare ass with it in front of every nigga on this plantation
and after i do that lets see you play the rooster round here
let you do it
oh thats right he gives you first name privileges
aint that cute
sass me me again nigger see what happen
stephen lying on the floor bites his tongue
thats what i thought
now git outta here
with as much dignity as he can muster stephen stands up
before he leaves django tells him when i ring this bell you better come a runnin
you not nobody else
while im on this property you my nigger snowball
django lies down on the bed
he covers his eyes with his arm
a door joins django and schultzs room
the adjoining door opens and schultz stands there
schultz was that wise
django doesnt remove his arm from
he aint tellin nobody bout that
thats all that needs to be said
lara lee cora and a traumatized but cleaned up shes dressed in a domestic maid uniform broomhilda stand outside dr
schultzs door after calvins sister raps on it
schultz opens the door
schultz hello ladies
schultz may i introduce to you hildi
hildi this is dr
schultz he speaks german
schultz ive been informed you do as well
it would be my pleasure to speak with you in german
schultz acts for the benefit of miss laras astonishment
please come inside fraulein
she does and justas lara lee is to say something schultz says thank you very much and closes the door in her face
miss lara looks to her mammy and the two women head off nonplussed
with the door closed schultz turns to the weak frightened disoriented girl
he gives her a pleasant smile
schultz they call you hildi but your real name is broomhilda isnt it
how do you know that
schultz stands to reason who ever taught you german would also give you a german name
can i pour you a glass of water broomhilda
hearing her name being spoke properly for the first time in awhile not to mention with a german accent does have a bit of a calming influence on the frightened
on the other side of the adjoining door listening waiting for his cue to present himself
back to broomhilda and dr
schultz as dr
schultz calmly pours the young lady a glass of water he begins talking to her in german subtitled in english dr
schultz im aware you havent spoken german in a long while
so ill talk slowly
im only speaking german to you now broomhilda in case candies people are listening to us
myself and a mutual friend of ours have gone through a lot of trouble and rode a lot of miles to find you fraulein to rescue you
he hands her a tall clear glass of water
she looks at him weird rescue me
schultz please drink
she absentmindedly obeys
schultz now its myself and our mutual friends intention to take you away from here forever
i dont got any friends
schultz yes you do
schultz i cant tell you
our mutual friend has a flair for the dramatic and he wants to surprise you
where is he
he points at the adjoining door
schultz standing right behind that door
her head moves in the direction of the door
he looks to the young woman dr
schultz promise me you wont scream
she nods her head yes
schultz say i promise
schultz moves to the door and lightly raps on it
the door knob turns
the door slowly opens revealing
her husband django but different all cowboyed out and cleaned up
he smiles at her and says hey little trouble maker
obviously a pet name between them
broomhilda goes into a bit of shock
first she loses strength in her wrist so the glass tips over and the water spills on the floor
followed quickly by herself spilling on the floor in a dead
the two men look at the woman on the floor then at each other dr
schultz you silver tongued devil you
we dissolve to later as we see dr
schultz and django explain what theyre doing there who theyre pretending to be and what their plan is to broomhilda
we hear a woman whistle a soft pretty tune on the soundtrack
its not a happy tune
but its pretty and vaguely optimistic
we dissolve to the slave pen the doomed men who didnt sell at greenville brooding rodney and chester and chicken charly spend their last night at candyland sleeping under the
stars in the slave pen
the same whistling tune continues over this scene
rodney sees the whole slave selling and buying group django dr
schultz candie bartholomew moguy ace woody brown and cody and the overseers walk across the plantation grounds on their way to the arena
laughin and joshin all the way
the hatred rodney feels for that group of men burns inside him like a red hot poker
a study in powerless fury
in the dining room of the big house with its knives spoons and forks
shes all by herself as she goes through this duty
the whistling tune weve been listening to has been coming from broomhilda whistling as she sets the table
suddenly out of the darkness of the background appears stephen
broomhilda stops whistling and spins surprised in stephens direction
what was you whistlin
you werent whistlin nothin you were whistlin somethin
somethin i heard
i dont know no
its kinder pretty
she doesnt say anything in return
that was a compliment
stephen steps out of the shadows into the light closer to broomhilda
im just sayin two days ago you wus in such misery here you hadda run off
so you run off we catch your ass an drag you back
then we stick your bare ass to sizzle in the hot box for bout ten hours
now here you are two days later whistlin while you work
im just sayin i
wouldn think youd have a hellva lot to whistle bout
im jus sayin
he watches the effect his words have on broomhildas face
im done here may i be excused
yes you may
she moves off to another part of the house
he watches her shuffle off
later that evening django and a lot of other white people calvin candie lara lee moguy and dr
schultz sat around the dinner table
they are being served by the black people weve come to know at candyland stephen cora and because dr
schultz likes her broomhilda
along with an army of domestic slaves acting as wait service
knowing djangos a slaver and for his dinner table privileges the domestic slaves despise django
even broomhilda will be shocked to hear him speak like a slaver even though they obviously gave her a heads up on their masquerade
we pick up the conversation in mid negotiation
schultz look monsieur candle they were all fine specimens no doubt about it
but the best three by far were sampson goldie and eskimo joe
by the way whys he called eskimo joe
oh you never know how these nigger nicknames get started
his name was joe
maybe one day he said he was cold
schultz irregardless we all know samsons your best and youll never sell him and i can see why hes a champion
all three are champions
django contradicts as he chews his steak samsons the champion
the other two are pretty good
all the domestic slaves around the table stiffen at witnessing django contradict calvin candie
including broomhilda whos wielding the gravy boat
after django says that while in shock she over pours beef gravy on lara lees mashed potatoes
broomhilda snaps back
instead of getting angry candle seems to reflect on that analysis then issues his own appraisal can eskimo joe whip sampson no
can he take goldie probably not goldies the best dirty fightin nigger i ever saw
but as long as you dont put em up against those two
eskimo joe will whip any niggers ass
the domestics freeze for a jerky second when django says that
schultz you must understand monsieur candie while admittedly a
neophyte in the nigger fight game i do have a bit of a background in the european traveling circus
hence i have big ideas when it comes to presentation
i need something more then just a big nigger
he needs to have panache
a sense of showmanship
i want to be able to
the black hercules
and i quote i would pay top dollar for the right nigger
now im not saying eskimo joe is the wrong nigger per se
but is he right as rain
everyone waits for calvins response
he milks the moment by taking a sip of his mint julep then says dr
schultz i will have you know there is no one in the nigger fight game that appreciates the value of showmanship more then monsieur calvin j
but one must not forget the most important thing in the nigger fight game
a nigger that can win fights
that should be your first second third four and fifth concern
after you have that and you know you have that then you can start to implement a grande design
but since i enjoy oldest man at the table status beating moguy by one year for that honor allow the old sage to advise first things first
broomhilda comes around with a bowl of string green beans
schultz says something pleasant to her in german
she smiles and says something pleasant back
i see you two gettin on
schultz breaks into a wide grin dr
monsieur candie you cant imagine what its like not to hear you native tongue for four years
hell i cant imagine two weeks in boston
everybody at the table chuckles
schultz i cant express the joy i felt conversing in my mother tongue
and broomhilda is a charming conversation companion
as broomhilda holds the bowl of green beans for moguy lara lee notices how django and broomhilda look and try not to look at each other
stephen enters the room with a fresh mint julep for monsieur candie
i dont know doctor you can lay on all the german sweet talk you want but it looks like this ponys got big eyes for django
lara lee has no idea how right she is but when she said it all three django broomhilda and schultz involuntarily jerk
stephen sees it
schultz covers the jerk with more of his verbal gobbilty gook
except for stephen no one else was the wiser
broomhilda takes her greenbeans and leaves the dining room for the kitchen
stephen watches her go then looks at django then hands candie his mint julep and goes into a broad routine for the tables benefit
stephen youre amazing
i havent finished a drink in this house in twenty years
when a man likes a cold drink a man likes a cold drink
did you overhear that joke i said about me spending two weeks in boston you dont have any idea the work i do to see food gets on the table
what does that hafta do with the price of tea in china
you think when im in that kitchen i got nothin better to do then listen in here to you tellin unfunny jokes
of course they laughed their parents raised them right
when theyre a guest in somebodys house and the master of of the house thinks hes funny you suppose to laugh
theyd be rude not to
they play their little comedy routine for all its worth
no it was really funny wasnt it
now what do you expect these people to say
what you need to do is stop embarrassing your guest
everybody dont laugh at him youre being polite i understand you mean well but it just encourages him
as the white folks chuckle stephen moves back into the kitchen
once stephen enters the kitchen his smile melts away and he locks eyes on broomhilda
he moves over to her
you know that nigger
i she spins around
dont stall me bitch you know who
at the table
i dont know him
you dont know him
you wouldnt lie to me now would you
she shakes her head no
stephen looks at her skeptical
okay if you say so
pick it up again in mid negotiation
eskimo joes a quality nigger no doubt about it
but if it was my money i wouldnt pay twelve thousand dollars for him
schultz what would your price be
well if i was inclined to be generous
and i dont know why i would be inclined to be generous
candies lawyer chimes in
but the real question is not how much he cost but how much he can earn
in a years time seven or eight fights outside of mississippi where his candyland pedigree werent well known virginia
georgia all goes well
twenty to twenty one thousand dollars
precisely bright boy good on ya
any way you cut that cake that spells profit
not to mention a years worth of action at the big table in a blood sport with a winner nigger
however let me reclarify how this whole negotiation came about
it wasnt me who came to you to sell a nigger it was you who approached me to buy one
now that nine thousand dollar figure bright boy was banding about aint too far off from right
and if i wanted to sell eskimo joe for that i could sell em any day of the week
but like you said in greenville doctor i dont wanna sell em
it was only your ridiculous offer of twelve thousand dollars that would make me consider it
schultz considerscalvin candies words then suddenly says dr
schultz you know monsieur candie
you do possess the power of persuasion
candie smiles at that remark
then suddenly schultz slaps the table hard with his hand and says dr
schultz why not
monsieur candie you have a deal eskimo joe twelve thousand dollars
the white people at the table get very happy
schultz continues dr
schultz however that is a tremendous amount of money
and the way you have your mr
moguy i have a lawyer a persnickety man named tuttle
and i would need my man to draw up a legal contract before i would feel comfortable exchanging that amount of money for flesh
not to mention having eskimo joe examined by a physician of my choosing
so say i return in about five days time with my mr
and then my mr
tuttle and your mr
moguy can hash out the finer points between themselves
stephen time for dessert
stephen cora broomhilda and the other domestics come out of the kitchen to clear away the dirty dishes
broomhilda goes to calvin
can i take away your dishes monsieur candle
yes you may hildi
she begins gathering the dirty dishes
candie looks up at her as she works
so hildi how you like servin at the big table in the big house
i like it a lot monsieur candle
its a lot better then sizzling in that hot box or draggin your ass through a bramble bush aint it
with candie interrogating broomhilda django tenses up
stephen clocks this
stephen decides to test djangos reaction
you know monsieur candle the doctor might be interested in seein hildis peeled back
seein as he dont see many niggers where he from
when you was alone with hildi here didja just speak german or did ya git her clothes off
schultz we just spoke
so you havent seen her back
schultz no i havent
then stephens right you would probably find this interesting
hildi take off your dress and show us your back
django hears this
broomhilda instinctively shoots a look to django
stephen clocks it
calvin i just got her all dressed up and looking nice
but lara lee dr
schultz is from dusseldorf they dont got niggers there
and hes a man of medicine
im sure it would fascinate him the niggers endurance for pain
i mean hildi got something like fifteen lashes on her back
lara lee get one shed lose her mind
these niggers are tough no doubt about it
calvin we are eating dessert no less
aint no one wanna see her whipped up back
django continues to watching this play out
stephen watches him
okay okay lara
maybe after dinner
during the brandies
broomhilda dismissed takes calvins dishes and heads back into the kitchen
stephen takes one more look at django and follows broomhilda behind the kitchen door
in the kitchen with the other domestics stephen says to broomhilda i thought you said you didnt know him
broomhilda turns around
stephen approaches her the other domestics get quiet and watch
i said you said you didnt know him
yes you do
mister stephen i dont
why you lyin to me
as tears begin to well in her eyes
why you cryin
because youre scarin me
why am i scarin you
because youre scary
things have become so tense and quiet in the kitchen that the dinner table conversation begins to bleed inside
we hear dr
schultz in the next room say dr
schultz os to speak german with hildi this afternoon was positively soul enriching
stephen hears this hes starting to get the idea
his eyes to to broomhilda
you stay in the kitchen
stephen moves to the kitchen door swings it open and watches dr
schultz prepare to proposition candie for broomhilda
stephen knows these two jokers django and schultz are up to something and now hes just figured it out
schultz you indicated earlier you would be willing to part with hildi
yes siree bob i did
schultz well in that case allow me to propose another proposition
in full ole jimmie performance stephen barges in the room interrupting dr
stephen you just interrupted dr
schultz oh i do apologize doctor

monsieur candie i need a word with you in the kitchen
what you mean get outta my chair
if you could manage it
its about dessert
what about dessert
i would rather tell you in private
were having rhubarb pie what sort of melodrama could be brewing back there
stephen bends down and whispers in his ear meet me in the library
well thats a horse of a different color
that means whatever stephen has to say hasnt anything to do with rhubarb pie
meet me in the library is their secret signal
fine friend stephen ill be along momentarily
candie stands up from his chair and addresses the table
well as you can see talented no doubt as they are in the kitchen from time to time adult supervision is required
if youll excuse me a moment
a masculine sanctuary for calvin candie
walls of perfectly bound books
stuffed animal heads deer boar that hes shot sit mounted on the walls
theres comfy red leather chairs and a bar in the globe
when we cut to this room we cut to stephen sitting in one of the red leather chairs drinking a brandy out of a brandy sifter
calvin enters the room sees stephen sitting in the chair drinking his brandy and doesnt bat an eye
it appears in this room calvins and stephens life long friendship exits on a different plane
outside of outside eyes in this room all pretense of master and slave is dropped and the number one and number two
men of candyland can talk turkey
whats the matter
those motherfuckers aint here to buy no mandingos
they want that girl
what the hell you talkin about
they playin your ass for a fool thats what im talkin bout
they aint here for no muscle bound jimmie they here for that girl
what girl hildi
the niggers know each other
he just bought eskimo joe
did he give you any money
well not yet but then he didnt r
y diddly not yet no how
but he was just about to buy who he came here to buy when i interrupted him
thank you stephen youre welcome calvin
where you gettin all this
why would they go through all that trouble to
buy a nigger with a chewed up back aint worth five hundred dollars
well theyre doin it cause djangos in love with hildi
shes probably his wife
now why that german gives a fuck about who that uppity son of a bitch is in love with im sure i dont know
if shes who they want why the whole snake oil pitch about mandingos
because you wouldnt pay no never mind to four hundred dollar
but twelve thousand got you real friendly
as per usual stephens right
those lyin goddamn
time wastin sonsabitches
you just watch im gonna fix their wagon but good
stephen we gonna have us a candyland tar and feathering
not that i wouldnt enjoy seein something like that
but why dont you sit down and lets talk about this
i let a goddamn nigger and nigger lovin huckster insinuate themselves at my dinner table and play this whole goddamn plantation for a fool
calm the fuck down sit down and lets discuss this
a frustrated calvin finally collapses in the chair
now look you knew and i knew there was something up with these two
we just didnt know what
but now we do
they dont want you to know how bad they want that girl
but these ole boys have rode a lotta miles went t a whole lotta trouble and done spread a whole lotta bull to get this girl
they must want her mighty bad
way i see it aint nothin changed
they wanna buy a nigger you wanna sell a nigger
the only thing done changed is the advantage
now we got it
so lets go back in there and busts these motherfuckers chops
the dinner table guests listen to lara leecandie fitzwilly hold court melodramatically
calvin candie enters the room from the kitchen door
lara lee oblivious to her brothers change in demeanor blurts out upon there you are
i was beginning to think you and that of crow ran off together
schultz and django feel the change in their hosts demeanor as he stares down the table at them
thatd be a hellva note wouldnt it lara lee
lara lee i just looked out the big winda
ace woodys out there dealin with some shady slaver sellin a passel of ponys
would you be a dear and go out there and give them gals an eyeball
that of boy knows everything to know bout mandingos but he dont know diddly bout black puddin
lara lee excuses herself and leaves the room as she goes out bartholomew with his sawed off shotgun comes
in behind schultz and django
can i ask you two gentlemen to look over your shoulder
schultz and django do and see bartholomew with his sawed off shotgun pointing at them
calvin candie removes his arm from behind his back and in his hand hes holding a big ugly hammer
now lay your palms flat on the table top
they put their palms on the table
now you lift those palms off that turtle shell table top bartholomew gonna let loose with both barrels of that sawed off
theres been a lotta lies said around this table tonight but that
you can believe
moguy would you be so kind as to collect the pistols hangin on those boyships
holding the hammer in his hand candie continues to hold court
now where were we
oh yes i do believe you were just getting ready to make me a proposition to buy broomhilda
bring out hildi
stephen enters the dining room through the kitchen door holding roughly in his grip broomhilda
he holds a small derringer pistol against the side of her head
django and schultz react
now it should be quite clear by now i know youre not here to buy no mandingos
reason yall came to candyland is yall want broomhilda
but yall dont want me to know how much you want er
so instead you waste my time with all this eskimo joe horseshit
stephen put her in that chair
stephen sits the young lady down in moguys old chair
with their palms against the table unarmed django and schultz silently watch candies next move
candie still holding the hammer continues
now the way i see it aint nothin changed
you still wanna buy a nigger i still wanna sell one
so with that in mind in greenville dr
schultz you yourself said for the right nigger youd be willing to pay what some would consider a ridiculous amount
to which me myself said what is your definition of ridiculous
to which you said twelve thousand dollars
now considering you two have ridden a whole lotta miles went to a whole lotta trouble and done spread a whole lotta bull to purchase the lovely lady to my
left it would appear that broomhilda is the right nigger
and if yall wanna leave candyland with broomhilda the price is twelve thousand dollars
schultz i take it you prefer the take it or leave it style of negotiating
candie continuing to hold the hammer continues
under the laws of chickasaw county broomhilda is my property
and i can do anything with my property i so desire
he brings the big hammer down hard on the dinner table making everybody jump
and if you think my price for this nigger is too steep what im gonna desire to do is take this hammer and beat her ass to death with it
right in front of both yall
he smashes the arm rest of the chair broomhildas sitting in
put up or shut up schultz
you wanna save this nigger bitch you gonna pay my price
schultz may i lift my hands from the table top in order to remove my billfold
yes you may
schultz removes his long brown leather billfold from his gray suit jacket and says dr
schultz easy come easy go
he slides the billfold down the table to candie
the plantation owner takes out the money does a quick count then looks down the table at the seated schultz and says pleasure doin business with you
insert calvin signing over broomhildas bill of sale
moguy signs as a witness
broomhilda stands next to django and watches her master sign her freedom papers
schultz sits off by himself
hes very disturbed
all the white people with calvin candie are happy and celebrate candies successes with glasses of brandy
lara lee ace woody and brown and cody have joined the celebration
for an experienced horsetrader the just concluded transaction is a thing of legend
he just sold a pony with a tore up back and a runaway r burned in her cheek aint worth five hundred dollars for twelve thousand
stephen smiles and laughs it up with everybody else
the other domestics bring out little plates of rhubarb pie and buzz around pouring coffee for the white people
candie walks over to the seated schultz he carries a small plate of rhubarb pie with him
schultz looks at the pie and the man
are you brooding bout me getting the best of ya
schultz actually i was thinking of that poor devil you fed to the dogs today dartagnan
and i was wondering what dumas would make of all this
calvin hands the doctor the two pieces of paper he needs
broomhildas bill of sale and her freedom papers
as he says the following he examines he papers
schultz alexander dumas
he wrote the three musketeers
i figured you must be an admirer
you named your slave after that novels lead character
if alexander dumas had been there today i wonder what he would of made of it
you doubt hed approve
schultz yes his approval would be a dubious proposition at best
soft hearted frenchy
schultz alexander dumas is black
schultz rises puts the papers in his back pocket
looks to his two companions django and broomhilda and says dr
schultz we got it lets go
normally monsieur candie i would say auf wiedersehen
but since what auf wiedersehen actually means is till i see you again and since i never wish to see you again to you sir i say goodbye
schultz begins to cross the room towards the exit
when calvin says to the germans back one more moment doc
its a custom here in the south once a business deal is concluded for the two parties to shake hands
it implies good faith
schultz im not from the south
he turns to leave
youre in my house doctor im afraid i must insist
this turns schultz around
schultz insist what
that i shake your hand before i leave
then im afraid i must insist in the opposite direction
calvin walks closer to the german doctor
you know what i think you are
schultz what you think i am
no i dont
i think you are a bad loser
schultz and i think youre an abysmal winner
never the less here in chickasaw county a deal aint done till the two parties have shook hands
even after all this paper signin dont mean shit you dont shake my hand
schultz if i dont shake your hand youre gonna throw away twelve thousand dollars
i dont think so
schultz looks to django and broomhilda
schultz lets go
bartholomew if she tries to leave here before this german shakes my hand
cut er down
schultz looks to django
then to candle
and then with a smile on his face and a twinkle in his eye asks dr
you really want me to shake your hand
django gets it
schultz well if you insist
django goes to stop him
the german crosses toward candie offering him his hand
candie offers his hand to schultz
the small derringer pops into schultzs outstretched hand
he shoots calvin candie in the heart
candie has a look of shock as blood explodes from his heart and he falls to the floor
everybody is stunned
schultz looks to django
django looks back
schultz im sorry
i couldnt resist
schultz is blown apart by bartholomews sawed off shotgun
the room comes to its senses and attacks django and broomhilda
we fade up from black to see the soles of djangos bare feet
a rope is tied around the ankles and its obvious hes been strung up upside down
the camera moves down his naked body down his legs we see his wrists arebound with ropes to his thigh down his bare buttocks down his whip scarred back to
the back of his head which hovers just about three inches from the barn yard wooden floor
eight year old stable boy timmy wipes the unconscious djangos face with a wet rag
they are all alone in the barn
django begins to come to
act like you still sleepin
hildi the slave girl that ran away a couple of days ago
they had her in the hot box
i dont know bout no girl
how bout that german white man i came here with
oh hes dead
his bodys over there
django twists upside down on the rope and sees the corpse of his friend king schultz dead on the filthy barn yard floor
the sight of the lifeless carcass of the doctor fills django with pain and anger
just then head overseer ace woody walks in the barn
upon seeing ace timmy hightails it out of there ace throws an empty bucket at the fleeing boy
git on outta here boy
swaying to and fro from the rope looks upside down at ace woody all dressed up in a black suit with a string tie which makes him look a bit
like wyatt earp
so yall bounty hunters
django thinks how does he know
i knew there was something fishy bout yall
we found your wanted posters and book of figures in your saddle bags
i gotta say aint never heard of no black bounty hunter before
a black boy paid to kill white men
how did ya like that line of work
django retorts upside down
well it turns out i was a natural
ace woody laughs
boy people round here are cross wit you
ace woody pulls up a tiny milking stool and sits down on it a body length from the hanging man
see boss man was a rather beloved figure round here
now hes dead as fried chicken everyone round here blames you
ace woody opens his black suit jacket we see not only does he wear a gun and holster around his waist he carries a huge bowie knife ina shoulder holster
he removes the big blade from its sheath
yep boss mans gone
poor goddamn calvin
were burnin him in a few hours
should be real pretty
i dont think youre gonna be able to attend
ace takes the bowie knife and throws it
it lands stuck in the wooden barn yard floor four inches from djangos face
ace woody slowly rises up from the tiny milking stool and slowly walks the length of the floor between him and django pulls the blade out of the floor and
walks back to his stool and sits back down
as he does this he says now i understand you didnt really have nuttin to do wit it
its that german sunbitch the trouble maker
you just wanted to git your girl and hightail your nigger asses outta here
now i appreciate that
but grieving folks round here need someone to blame
and i guess they figure if you hadnt brought your black ass round here in the first place boss man still be alive
and you know what they got a point
he throws the knife again
this time it lands in the floor two inches from djangos face
he walks the same path from the knife and back to the tiny stool
as he does he says now when it comes to making a nigger regret the error of his ways believe me when i
tell you i know every goddamn trick in the book
now theres a lotta ass busters out there try an git creative with the way they bust ass
i always found the best methods are tried and true
he throws the knife again
django jerks his head back
and the knife lands in the floor right where djangos head was
ace woody stands up walks the floor to the bowie yanks it out of the wood
and straightens up standing right beside the hanging upside down naked black man
ace talks confidentially to the bound man at his mercy
you know blackie here at candyland i had me a real sweet deal
these last eleven years training calvins mandingos i made me more money i made my whole goddamn life
and no end in sight neither
then you came along
knocked me right off that perch i was sittin pretty on
you think miss lara gonna be as
interested in mandingos as her brother
i dont think so
what i think is you done fucked up my good thang
so when it comes to you django boy you could say i gotta axe to grind
he grabs a handfull of djangos genitals in his fist
he takes his big bowie and places the razor sharp blade against djangos nut sack
django dances at the end of the rope like live bait on a fishing pole
hows the blade of that bowie feel against your ball sack blackie
a bowie right off the wet stone
now thats what i call sharp
django dances some more
yep nigger im gonna snip them nuts
on the count of three
got to do it boy
just then stephen appears in the entrance of the barn blacksmith facility
hes holding djangos clothes in a bundle under his arm
capt miss lara lookin for you
she wanna talk about the old mans funeral
oh and she changed her mind bout snippin django
she gonna give em to the lequint dickey people
while still keeping a firm grip on djangosjunk ace woody says well she didnt waste a minute tellin me
ace woody looks down at django both men get over the aborted emotion of what almost happened
where she at
she in the big house
ace turns to leave stephen goes over to a big fiery furnace in the blacksmith barn and begins poking a long poker which lies buried in the fire
djangos clothes are dumped by the furnace
you gonna look after our friend
as he plays with the poker in the fire he says oh yes sirree bob you know i am
snowball and a certain naked ass upside down nigger we both know gonna have us a big of chat
he removes the big black poker from the furnaces fire its red hot end snowballs just makin sure his talking stick is all nice and frosty
ace woody chuckles to himself as he exits the barn
just stephen with a red hot poker and naked bound upside down django alone
with the red hot poker in his hand snowball approaches the naked hanging django
i bet you an that german thought yall was on easy street for awhile didnt ya
yall track hildi to the old man
you get the idea to go to greenville look up the ole man there
that was a good idea
i bet yall couldnt believe how easy it was
you meet moguy he buys your horseshit
ya git your ass invited to candyland no fuss no muss
ya ride the whole way to the plantation no one the wiser
then ya ride in to candyland ride your goddamn horses right up to the motherfucking big house
and thats where you met me
and thats when you knew your goose was cooked
he touches djangos nipple with the orange hot tip of the poker
unlike a lot of movie heros django doesnt take torture silently and stoically
this shit fucking hurts so you best believe he screams his fucking ass off and twists in agony when he gets touched by the orange tip of that red hot
now that fancy talkin white man of yours didnt know whats what
he still thought his ass hadda chance
but like the one eyed charly you are you always know the end is near fore the white folks
with the orange hot poker he burns off djangos other nipple
the smell of burned flesh smokes in the air
stephen makes a show of breathing it in his nostrils
damn nigger you smell good
he walks behind django with the poker
you know when you was sittin on that feather bed in the quest room in the big house after you slapped my ass to the floor you were sayin something
bout my bare black ass and how you were gonna bust it
remember that bright boy
he places the hot orange end of the poker hard against djangos bare buttocks
stephen walks away and sticks the poker back in the fire
he goes through djangos clothes and pulls out his tan pants
he tosses them on the floor by the hanging man
you leavin thats what you can take with you
stephen walks over to the hanging upside down man and as he talks to him he begins fondling djangos genitals
now you were quite the topic of conversation for the last few hours
seemed like folks never had a bright idea in their life was comin up with different ways to kill your ass
now most of dem ideas involved fuckin wit your fun parts
but while that might seem like a good idea
truth is once ya snip a niggers nuts most bleed out
then i say hells bells the niggers we send to lequint dickey got it worse then that
then theyre lets whip em to death throw em to the mandingos feed em to stonesiphers dogs
and then i say whats so special bout that
we do that shit all the time
hells bells the niggers we send to lequint dickey got it worse then that
he stops massaging djangos balls
so miss lara got the bright idea of givin your ass to the lequint dickey mining company
and as a slave of the lequint dickey mining company hence forth till the day you die you will be swinging a sledgehammer all day every day turning big rocks
into little rocks
and trust me when i tell you its gonna be bout as much fun as it sounds
we sell em the mandingos aint good for nuttin no more
like them three yall came back with
for them big garboons we get twenty a piece
they last bout six months
skinny nigger like you i give two or three
stephen turns to leave
shes all right for now
miss lara soft hearted on er
she gave her to billy crash
he was sweet on er
now billy crash might not look or smell too good but aint nobody gonna bother her
stephen limps away
the caravan coming from the lequint dickey mining company comes riding up to the plantation
it comes equipped with one cage wagon from a prison one white trash peckawood named floyd to drive the wagon a nd white trash peckawood named roy to ride lead
horse and a white trash peckawood named jano to bring up the rear riding horses ass plus a pack horse that carries dynamite for the mine
the three peckawoods who all talk with thick australian accents have stopped the caravan and are having a powwow
its chaos round here

the three mandingos who werent sold in greenville rodney chicken charly and chester are walked to the wagon by overseers tommy giles
and broomhildas new owner billy crash

chester wears a hat and chicken charly has a corncob pipe in his mouth
the wagon driver floyd approaches them

floyd takes thehat off of chesters head and sails it away
as well as ripping the corncob pipe out of chicken charlys mouth and tossing it in the dirt
to chicken charly you wont be doin much smokin mate
to all three you are now the property of the lequint dickey mining company

this is going to be worse then the three even thought
they climb into the cage wagon
floyd locks it behind them
roy the head aussie pays billy crash for the slaves when we hear ace woody call out hold on we got another hammer swinger for ya
ace woody comes walking out of the barn with django shirtless and barefoot just like we met him at beginning of the story wearing his old tan pants and his
wrists bound by a rope
we cant use that skinny bastard
we got an arraignment with mr
dickey to take punishment niggers from time to time

django sees the three mandingos in the cage

django stops ace woody
whoa whoa whoa you cant put me in there with them

jano youre riclin horses ass you take this black and make sure he keeps up
oh ill keep em up
jano takes the rope tired around djangos wrists
and ties the other end around his saddle horn
the lequint dickey mining company caravan leaves candyland
the caravan makes its way down a dirt road in pretty chickasaw county
stoic roy riding lead horse floyd driving the cage wagon rodney chester and chicken charly bouncing around inside the cage wagon jano riding horses ass and django being led on
foot behind him
jano ignores him

janos hand grabs his riding crop and he brings it up to strike django when the black man says to him howd you like to make eleven thousand dollars
django steps closer to him
how would you like to make eleven thousand dollars eleven thousand five hundred actually
roy in the lead yells back to jano goddamit jano stop fuckin with that black and keep up
keep riding just ride slower
they move forward with django walking beside jano on his horse
back at that plantation candyland there was an eleven thousand five hundred dollar fortune just sittin there and yall rode right past it
you be damned blackie
were not bandits
thats whats nice about this fortune its not illegal
you cant steal it ya gotta earn it
if you got something to say say it
the eleven thousand five hundred dollar fortune waiting for you back at candyland is in the form of a wanted dead or alive bounty on smitty bacall and the smitty
who the fuck is smitty bacall
smitty bacall is the leader of a murdering gang of stagecoach robbers the bacall gang
theres a seven thousand dollar dead or alive bounty on him
and one thousand five hundred dollars for each of his three accomplices dandy michaels gerald nash and crazy craig koons
and all four of them gentlemen are sittin back there at candyland
laughin their ass off
cause they just got away with murder
but it dont hafta be that way
you and your mates could get that money
who pays the money
the austin texas courthouse
oh and by the way the court dont give a damn about how you kill em
you can shoot em in the back from up on a hill in the back of the head in their sleep dont matter
court doesnt care how you do it just as long as you do it
pay us to kill em
you kill em and they payyou for the corpse
i think so
what did these jokers do again
killed innocent people in a stagecoach robbery
ive got the handbill in my pocket
django digs into his tan pants and pulls out the folded up smitty bacall handbill that dr
schultz told him to hang on to for good luck
he hands it to jano
i told you its the handbill for smitty bacall and the bacall gang
jano looks at the handbill
whatsamatter cant you read
i can read i just dont have my glasses
i didnt take em with me because i didnt think id be doin much readin on a nigger run
what about that cowboy fella in the lead
can roy read
look get it straight black i can fuckin read
i just dont got my glasses
ext beautiful mississippi country tableaux at dusk the lequint dickey mining co
caravan has stopped and pulled over to the side of the road
rodney chicken charly and chester sit in the cage and watch through the bars this new turn of events without any
clear comprehension of what theyre watching
what the three caged men are watching is the three australian mining company employees and django off in the distance where they cant hear what theyre saying having some sort
of a discussion
that includes the still bound by the wrists django showing the three men a piece of paper
roy holds it in his hand as he reads and django talks
i aint no goddamn slave
do i sound like a fuckin slave
im a bounty hunter
yesterday as a free man i rode into candyland on a horse with my white german partner dr
wed tracked the bacall gang from texas all the way to chickasaw county
found them laying low at candyland
we went in to get em things went sour
my partner was killed and calvin candie was shot
everybody there decided to blame me so here i am
you know im not on the manifest
all of you know im not suppose to be on this trip
but those four men are still back there
theyre still wanted
and that eleven thousand five hundred is still up for grabs
and the last thing theyd expect is yall rid
in back and gittin it
django is damn convincing
whats your deal
you tell us who they are and we let ya go
i aint tellin who they are
but you give me a pistol and a horse and five hundred dollars of that eleven thousand five hundred and ill point em out to you
hes got these greedy sonsabitches right on the hook
he just needs one little push
yall wanna ask somebody if im tellin the truth ask them mandingos
you cant put me in the same cage with them without them killin me
why ya think that is
ask them am i a candyland slave or did i ride in there on a horse with a white man yesterday
go to the cage wagon to talk with the three mandingos
as they walk roy continues to study the handbill
wanted dead or alive
smitty bacall and the bacall gang
for murder and stagecoach robbery
seven thousand dollars for bacall
one thousand five hundred dollars for each of his gang members
this is a real handbill
just because the handbills real doesnt mean that other bunch of malarky
why would a nigger slave have a wanted dead or alive handbill in his pocket
floyd doesnt have an answer for that one
that blacks damn convincing
they get to the cage omen
roy startles them with a direct question pointing behind him at django that black ride into candyland yesterday
the caged men dont know what theyre suppose to say
roy removes the pistol from his belt cocks back the hammer and points the barrel at the cage
im gonna ask again and remember i dont like liars
is he a candyland slave or did he ride in with a white man yesterday
they walked us from the greenville auction and he rode on a horse with a white man
this white man was the black his slave
he werent no slave
you sure about that
roy starts taking the possibility of an eleven thousand dollar windfall seriously
what happened at candyland
bunch of shootin master got shot
who shot em
and why did he do that
the nigger and the german were actin as if they were slavers but they werent
what were they
floyd is starting to get convinced
goddamn roy this could be big
to the slaves do you know who smitty bacall is
barking at floyd they wouldnt go by their outlaw names you idiot
roy and floyd walk back to django and jano
okay black you gotta deal
i got one more condition
when we get there when the time comes you let me help you kill em
roy whips out a big knife and cuts the rope around djangos wrists
you got a deal black
django interrupts you gotta deal mate
roy really laughs this time
as does django and the other two aussies
youre all right for a black fella
rodney chicken charly and chester watch the sight of the white men cutting the ropes that bound the black mans wrists as well as them all sharing a laugh with
who is this nigger
well give you that pack horse
whats them saddle bags filled with
aint ridin no horse with no goddamn dynamite on his back
yeah i can see why
jano take those sticks off that horse and stick em in the nigger cage
jano does this lifting two out of four bags filled with dynamite off the pack horse and walking to the cage wagon unlocking the cage door and placing the bags
the black men in the cage dont like this at all
jano removes the last of the dynamite filled saddle bags from djangos horse throws them over his shoulders and begins walking back to the cage wagon
django moves to his new pack horse and says wheres my pistol
floyd you got that rifle on the wagon give em your gun and your belt
floyd unbuckles his gun belt gun and all folds it up and walks over to django handing it to him
django accepts it
about the pistol floyd tells django now dont drop it now
i just had the sights fixed last month its perfect
django holding the gunbelt in his hand
thats good to know
without taking the pistol out of the gunbelt django shoots floyd twice in the chest
roy turns around
django takes the gun out of the holster
roy is hit in the upper brain area and falls to the grass dead
jano goes for the gun on his hip
django shoots one of the saddle bags over
jano is blown to smithereens
the kahboom knocks django on his ass
the cage wagon rodney chester and chicken charlie come down from the shock of the blast
the image outside the bars of their cage is of dust and smoke in the air obscuring all visibility
a sudden gust of wind comes and blows all the smoke and dust away revealing in bright color focus
django standing among the two dead aussies and whatever is left of jano
hes shoeless and shirtless but floyds pistol and gunbelt sit wrapped around his waist
he locks eyes with the three men in the cage
he then moves towards the wagon and unhooks the mine company beast and climbs aboard him bareback
he leans over and snatches the rifle that floyd kept on the wagon seat next to him
grabbing a fistful of the horses mane he digs his heels into the beasts side
the pack animals springs to life under the new rider
by now it should be apparent that django brings the best out of horses and horses bring the best out of django
from his high horse django looks down at the three caged men
using the rifle in a quick one handed move he shoots the lock on the cage door
he looks at the three men especially rodney then says throw up that dynamite
rodney grabs a saddle bag full of dynamite and tosses it to django on his horse
django wraps it around the horses neck turns the beast around and without saying another word rides back in the direction of candyland
the three now free mandingos watch him ride away
who was that nigger
rz a gorgeous big sky southern purple and orange sunset we pan down from the sky and see in small black silhouette the funeral procession of calvin candie carrying the
coffin of the former master up the hill on candyland that leads to the graveyard
a white preacher walks out in front of the procession
then comes calvin candies coffin carried by eight pallbearers stephen moguy bartholomew ace woody brown cody and his best mandingos samson and goldie
the first mourner in line is lara lee dressed in a fancy black dress wide brim black hat black veil and ever present black mammy cora crying at her side
the skys real pretty miss lara
monsieur candie think it real nice
ah bless you sweet innocent cora
of django riding the horse on the way back to candyland
the bare backed black man riding the horse bareback holding the rifle in one hand a fistful of the horses mane in the other hauling ass against a gorgeous sunset
sky looks like an indian
the same gorgeous sunset sky over the same shitty tracker shack bunkhouse that mr
stonesipher and his three obscure companions share
the german shepherds including marsha rest in the chicken wire kennel next to the bunkhouse
the four trackers are
missing the funeral hanging out in the bunkhouse wearing their beards
stonesipher lex and stew are playing a mountain card game which looks like poker except the way you get rid of your cards is different
instead of chips they play with nigger ears yes the ears of slaves
on a second viewing the audience may notice that some of the slaves at candyland are missing one ear
jake the biggest is off by himself pounding nails into a small delicate birdhouse hes making
insert horse hoofs walking then stopping
djangos bare feet jump on to the ground
the four dogs lay out
when marsha hears something and raises her head
moves quietly through the woods
rises to all fours to listen and smell
out in the darkness her three pals continue to lay out
he can see the bunkhouse entrance the long handle axe buried in the chopping block the kennel and the one dog looking his way
the other three dogs wake up and go on alert
they hear the barking inside
jake building his birdhouse
stonesipher check on marsha
jake the one not playing the game puts aside his hammer and rises to check on them these guys are very sensitive about their dogs
as the barking gets louder we see a close up of the axe in the chopping block and djangos hand removing it
opens the bunkhouse door he sees directly a hundred feet in front of him django standing there with the axe
just as he reacts
after letting go of the axe handle django runs full speed toward jake
before the other three have really registered whats happening django has crossed the distance and is yanking the axe out of jakes face
and with axe in hand django chases and fights with all three trackers till after a point where hes chopped down two of them lex and stew and now theres
stonesipher has managed to draw his gigantic buck knife and is able to fight back against django
you know stonesiphers great with a knife plus his fighting style is like one of his dogs attack attack attack
django uses the axe handle in a defensive position
the expert mountain boy begins scoring blade cuts on shirtless django
the two men fight until they end up losing their weapons
then its just a fight of brute strength and survival
stonesipher is physically bigger then django
but if djangos going to save broomhilda not to mention get revenge on all these candyland motherfuckers he has to take stonesiphers ass out
this black man who has been under the yoke of white mans domination all his life and this white man who feeds black people to dogs fight each other for
django gets his arm around stonesiphers neck in a headlock but the mountain boy is big enough to lift django
so like a rodeo rider holding onto bull for dear life django tightens his lock around his opponents neck
django gets his hand on the hammer jake was building the birdhouse with and brings it crashing down on the top of that weakens stonesipher
he hits him again in the head
that drops stonesipher to his knees
he hits him again with the hammer on the head
that puts the mountain man down on his back
he hits him one more time with the hammer to keep him down for good
the trackers are all dead
only the dogs mad barking remains
ext the funeral night the funeral for calvin candie is underway
the preacher reads some words over him
django half naked splattered with blood from the axe murders steps out of the shack
he takes a wash basin off the window sill and walks over to the water pump
marsha and her three friends continue to bark like mad
he pumps a couple of times and water explodes into the bowl
he begins washing the blood offof himself
as he washes he says outloud what ya doin around here boy
timmy steps from his watching place in the bushes
i was just walkin by
wanna help me out
my woman hildi is with billy crash
you know where his shack is
you show me
will i get in trouble
not by the time i get through killin everybody
timmy has never heard a black man talk like that
he believes him
ill show ya
django turns towards the barking dogs
he turns back to timmy and asks you know what toadstools look like
go pick me a mess of em
insert timmy picking toadstools poison mushroms
insert django stirring a big pot of beef stew with a wooden spoon in the tracker shack
timmy comesin carrying a bunch of toadstools inside his shirt
django takes the toadstools and mr
stonesiphers buck knife and chops the mushrooms into tiny pieces
he tosses the tiny bits of poisoned shrooms into the beefy sauce and mixes it up with the spoon
django throws the pot of poisoned beef stew over the top of the kennel
it lands on the ground with a plop
the angry dogs are nevertheless still dogs and greedily scarf up the stew
django watches them wolf down their ultimate agony with a smile
you bit your last nigger bitch
bite on that
django lifts timmy up on to the bare backed wagon horse
first things first boy
take me to my horse
the funeral is in full melodramatic bore
timmy brings django to the stable on the candyland grounds
django goes straight up to the stall housing tony and says hello
tonys happy to see him
django feeds him an apple he picked along the way for him
he turns and sees the body of dr
schultz lying in a heap
and schultzs horse fritz in the stable
saddle up fritz and tony
timmy just stares
timmy hops to work
django bends down over the body of dr
schultz he takes broomhildas bill of sale and freedom papers out of his back pocket
he also searches for and finds schultzs hidden derringer he keeps it in a holster around his ankle
as timmy saddles the horses he asks do you feel bad for your friend
django rises from the body of his friend
yeah i do
as timmy saddles the horses he says i know just how ya feel
i lost a white friend once
he drowned in the lake
django doesnt correct the difference between dr
schultz and a white friend because theres nothing he could say to timmy to make him understand
he goes over to his pile of clothes which still lie next to the furnace
he puts on his boots
his green jacket over his bare chest
and finally his hat
ext the funeral night the service is over everybody is hugging each other and holding hands and beginning to leave
billy crash is in bed fucking broomhilda
she doesnt wail she doesnt make any whimpering sounds but her eyes constantly water
as billys fucking her he says its gonna be real nice round here now the ol mans gone
would you stop your galdarn cryin
he stops fucking in frustration i cant

he hops off her and yells at her

git use to it
look you know me hildi
im an ass buster from way back
but you know ive always been sweet on you
i dont wanna bust your ass
so dont make me
now im gonna go shit
you calm down
he exits the shack to go the outhouse leaving broomhilda alone
we move into a close up of broomhilda lying on the bed
she cries for django she cries for herself
she hears an impact sound and a muffled ooomph sound
and through the spaces in the wooden planks that act as walls in billy crashs shack she sees a figure fall to the ground
then she sees another figure through the wooden planks move towards the front door
her face stained with tears watches the door
a soft knock knock on the door
the voice on the other side of the door says hey little trouble maker
she hops out of bed and throws open the door
she runs into his arms
ext the funeral night the two old slave
grave diggers are throwing the first shovelfuls of dirt on monsieur calvin j
the participants of this ritual begin to move away from the grave
the funeral is a private affair just the candie family unit some of the overseers and the slaves
no one from town except the preacher
the slave mourners begin
to move towards their living area all saying goodbye to miss lara
miss lara makes a big show of saying goodbye to them
a little cognizant of the candie family unit begin the walk off the hill back to the big house
django with broomhilda
billy crash lies dead in the b
stonesiphers buck knife buried deep in his chest
he hands broomhilda her papers
heres your bill of sale and freedom papers

but what about you dont worry about me
ill see you with timmy and the horses by the big house
he sends her on her way
django looks up and sees the silhouettes of the funeral party walking down hill heading back for the big house
ext the trail back to the big house night the family unit of the late calvin candie and his sister lara lee walk back to the big house for a
this candie family unit consists of lara lee unarmed in her black flowing funeral dress
cora unarmed her mammy walks with miss lara holding her hand
unarmed dressed in his fancy black velvet version of his normal house nigger outfit walks on the other side of his mistress miss lara holding her other hand
ace woody armed with a gun belt
around his hip dressed in his wyatt earp like funeral black suit with the string tie walks by himself
leonide moguy armed with a gun belt around his hip walks by himself
bartholomew unarmed dressed in his tight fitting business suit with his hat walks alone
brown and jingle bells cody both armed with guns on their hips both dressed slightly like cowboy peacocks walk together
and finally samson and goldie unarmed calvin candies two prized mandingos wearing suits they borrowed from bartholomew
this candie family unit walk to the big house for a few post funeral drinks
they enter the lawn in front of the big house and head for the front door
broomhilda on fritz and timmy riding on tony come along the side of the property by some shed
they see the candie family unit all dressed in their darkest finery walking towards the front steps of the big house
the woman and little boy stop
but the group of enemies arent looking their way
the candie family unit moves closer towards the front of the big house
the front of the big house knocking the
candie family unit flat on their collective asses
broomhilda and timmy cant believe their eyes
hang in the air
the candie family unit starts coming to their senses
nobody was killed or even seriously hurt unless you count eardrums just stunned
as their minds try and grasp with what just happened their eyes look up from the ground and try and see through the smoke and dust
thesmoke and dust thins a little and we see inside the smoke the mansion has been obliterated but the big house front steps remain
cue cool music
stephen sees something in the smoke squints
ace woody sees something in the smoke squints
brown and cody see something in the smoke squint
in the smoke and dust we begin to see a figure walking towards them
ace woody squints at the figure
moguy sees the
cora attending to miss lara sees the figure then miss lara sees it
the figure moves further out of the smoke and dust
ace woody on the ground his hand starts to move towards the gun around his waist
then he sees the figure
is carrying something in his left hand
its floyds winchester he raises it and points it at ace
ace woodys hand moves away from his gun
the figure steps out of the smoke
its django dressed in his django stephen ace woody moguy lara lee bartholomew cora brown and jingle bells cody sampson or goldie
nobody can believe djangos standing there
he stands at the top of the front steps of the big house looking down at the candie family unit all lying on the front lawn winchester rifle held casually
in his left hand
his right hand held casually by the gun on his hip
the candie family unit all on their ass in the grass look up at django with a mixture of wonder fear and hate
as she watches this
as django looks out at the ten stunned enemies spread out on the big house front lawn
and as they look back from the grass at him
the black man in the cool green jacket says i bet i
know what youre thinkin ace woody
re thinkin why didnt icut off that niggers nuts when
i guess i shoulda
yes you should of
he points the winchester at the people spread out on the grass
everybody stand up
its now django who gives the orders
they stand up quickly
django with the rifle pointing at them just looks at the candie family unit
enjoying their collective hatred
he tosses the rifle away
then moves his right hand by his gun belt in his holster as he takes a everybody realizes djangos intentions
even broomhilda and timmy
django looks down from his position at the top of the big house steps at the ten people and says all black folks take ten steps away from the white
djangos eyes go to stephen who looks back at him
not you stephen
youre right where you belong
the black folks cora bartholomew samson and goldie begin taking ten steps away from the white folks and the gunfight
lara lee cant believe coras leaving her
cora is im sorry miss lara but i never did nuttin to that nigger
django looks to stephen and takes schultzs hidden derringer out of his pocket
lets see if you can handle this as well as you can my nuts
he tosses the ole man the tiny gun
somebody give miss lara a gun
brown gives lara lee one
of his two guns

brown cocks back the hammer of the peacemaker and puts it in her hand and points it towards the ground
to lara lee okay miss lara keep it pointed down till the shootin starts
then bring it up as fast as you can
lara lee candie fitzwilli cant come to grips with what shes
in the middle of who shes facing whats in her hand or whats about to happen
to the six make your play hillbillies
the music swells
everybody except for lara lee is ready the people watching on the side everyones ready but no one wants to start this party
ace woody starts to go for the gun in his holster and stephen starts to raise his derringer
but its no contest
as soon as django saw any movement from the six in front of him floyds pistol was quicksilver fast in
his right hand as his left hand fanned the pistols hammer shooting instantly all five white people and stephen standing in front of him
they all fall to grass in different ways
it was never any contest they and we the audience just didnt know how good django was
django showing off his incredible fast draw and accurate marksmanship to dr
schultz you know what theyre going to call you my boy
the fastest gun in the south
django stands on the top steps of whats left ofthe big house looking down at the candie family unit who all lay dead or dying on the candyland front lawn
the witnesses cant fathom what theyjust witnessed
all the candie family unit lies on the grass shot
but some are still alive
we hear moaning coming from lara lee cody and moguy
django sees this
the black man reaches behind him and comes out with a dynamite stick
he tosses it on the grass among the bodies
he takes aim with his pistol and fires
finishing off what was left of the candie family unit not to mention blowing the limbs off of many of them
the lawn is silent
djangos pistol goes back in its holster
django walks down the front steps of the big house feeling tremendous satisfaction in the wrath he just wroth on candie and co
he removes dr
schultzs tiny derringer from stephens dead hand putting it in his pocket
then heads over to where broomhilda and timmy wait for him with fritz and tony
as he walks up to broomhilda on fritz he says hey little trouble maker
hey big trouble maker
timmy hops off of tony
django climbs aboard tony
he says to broomhilda i tole you aint nuttin gonna happen to me
