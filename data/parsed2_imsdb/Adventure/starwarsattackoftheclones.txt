a vast sea of stars severas as a backdrop for the main title following by a rollup whcih crawls into infinity
there is unrest in the galactic senate several hundred solar systems under the leadership of the rebel leader count dooku have decalred their intentions to secede from the republic
this separatist movement has made it difficult for the limited number of jedi kights to maintain peace and order in the galaxy
senator amidala the former queen of naboo is returning to coruscant to vote on the critical issue of creating an army to assist the overwhelmed jedi
pan up to reveal the amber city planet of coruscant
a yellow naboo fighter flies over camera toward the planet followed by a large royal cruiser and two more fighters
the ships skim across the surface of the city landscape
the sun glints off the chrome hulls of the sleek naboo spacecraft as they navigate between the buildings of the capital planet
two naboo fighters land on one leaf of a three leaf clover landing platform
the royal starship lands on the central lead and the third fighter lands on the remaining plaform
a small group of dignitaries waits to welcome the senator
one of the members of the group os a well dressed jar jar binks a member of the galactic representative commission and dorme senator amidalas handmaiden
one of the fighter pilots jumps from the wing of his ship and removes his helmet
he is captain typho senator amidalas security officer
he moves over to a woman pilot
we made it
i guess i was wrong there was no danger at all
the ramp pwers
two naboo guards appear
senator amidala one handmaiden verse and four troopers descend the ramp
amidala is more beautiful now than she was ten years earlier when as queen she was freeing her people from the yoke of the trade federation
the dignitaries start to move forward
senator amidala reaches the foot of the ramp when suddenly there is a blinding flash and a huge explosion
the dignitaries and pilots are hurled to the ground as the starship is destroyed
klaxons blare alarms sound
captain typho and the two escort pilots get up and run to where senator amidala lies dying
beyond artoo detoo drops down from the naboo fighter and rolls toward the wreckage
the female escort pilot kneels by senator amidala and takes off her helmet revealing senator padme amidala
she gathers up her decoy double in her arms
cordes eyes are open
she looks up at her
im sorry mlady
not sure i
padme hugs her
padme lowers corde to the ground
she gets up and looks around at the devastation
there are tears in her eyes
i should not have come back
mlady you are still in danger
amidala says nothing
this vote is very important
you did your duty and corde did hers
she doesnt respond mlady please
they walk away
artoo lets out a small whimper and rolls off after them
the massive senate building glistens in the afternoon sun
small patches of fog have still to burn off
the vast rotunda is buzzing with chatter
mas amedda the supreme chancellors majordomo tries to quiet things down as palpatine confers with an aide uv gizen riding a small one man floating scooter
we shall have order
the motion for the republic to commission an army takes precedent and that is what we will vote on at this time
everything quiets down
the aide disperses and supreme chancellor palpatine steps to the podium
my esteemed colleagues excuse me
i have just received some tragic and disturbing news
senator amidala of the naboo system
has been assassinated
there is a shock silence in the vast arena
continued this grievous blow is especially personal to me
before i became chancellor i served amidala when she was queen
she was a great leader who fought for justice not only in this honourable assembly but also on her home planet
she was so loved she could have been elected queen for life
she believed in public service and she fervently believed in democracy
her death is a great loss to us all
we will all mourn her as a relentless champion of freedom
and as a dear friend
there is a moment of silence
ask aak the senator of malastare moves his pod into the centre of the arena
how many more senators will die before this civil strife ends
we must confront these rebels now and they need an army to do it
a second pod moves into the centre of the area with darsana the why werent the jedi able to stop this assassination
we are no longer safe under their protection
senator orn free taa swings forward in his pod
the republic needs more security now
before it comes to war
must i remind the senator from malastare that negotiations are continuing with the separatists
peace is our objective here
the senators yell pro and con
mas amedda tries to calm things down
senator padme amidala with captain typho jar jar and dorme manoeuvre her pod into the centre of the vast arena
my noble colleagues i concur with the supreme chancellor
at all costs we do not want war
the senate goes quiet then there is an outburst of cheering and applause
it is with great surprise and joy the chair recognises the senator from naboo padme amidala
less than an hour ago an assassination attempt was made against my life
one of my bodyguards and six others were ruthlessly and senselessly murdered
i was the target but more importantly i believe this security measure before you was the target
i have led the opposition to build an army
but there is someone in this body who will stop at nothing to assure its passage
many of the senators boo and yell at senator amidala
continuing i warn you if you vote to create this army war will follow
i have experienced the misery of war first hand i do not wish to do it again
there is sporadic yelling for and against her statements
wake up senators
you must wake up
if you offer the separatists violence they can only show us violence in return
many will lose their lives
all will lose their freedom
this decision could very well destroy the very foundation of our great republic
i pray you do not let fear push you into a disastrous decision
vote down this security measure which is nothing less than a declaration of war
does anyone here want that
i cannot believe they do
there is an undercurrent of booing
senator orn free taa moves his pod next to amidala
my motion to defer the vote must be dealt with first
that is the rule of law
amidala looks angry and frustrated
palpatine gives her a sympathetic look
due to the lateness of the hour and the seriousness of this motion we will take up these matters tomorrow
until then the senate stands adjourned
the giant towers of the republic executive building seem to reach the heavens
traffic clogs the smoggy sky
chancellor palpatine sits behind his desk with two red clad royal guards on either side of the door
yoda plot koon ki ad mundi and mace windu sit acress from him
i dont know how much longer i can hold off the vote my friends
more and more star systems are joining the separatists
if they do break away no
i will not let that happen
but if they do you must realise there arent enough jedi to protect the republic
we are keepers of the peace not soldiers
master yoda do you think it will really come to war
yoda closes his eyes
worse than war i fear
what do you sense master
impossible to see
the dark side clouds everything
but this i am sure of opens his eyes do their duty the jedi will
a muted buzzer sounds
a hologram of an aide dar wac appears on the chancellors desk
the loyalist committee has arrived my lord
send them in
they all stand as senator amidala captain typho jar jar mas amedda dorme and senators bail organa horox ryyder and orn free taa enter the office
yoda and mace windu move to greet the senator yoda taps amidala with his cane
with you the force is strong
to see you alive brings warm feeling to my heart
thank you master yoda
do you have any idea who was behind the attack
our intelligence points to disgruntled spice miners on the moons of naboo
i dont wish to disagree but i think that count dooku was behind it
there is a stir of surprise
you know mlady count dooku was once a jedi
he wouldnt assassinate anyone it is not in his character
he is a political idealist not a murderer
in dark times nothing is what it appears to be but the fact remains senator in grave danger you are
palpatine gets up walks to the window and looks out at the vast city
count dooku has always avoided any kind of conflict
it appears he has no desire to start a war
why would he kill you
to what end
i dont know but everything in my being tells me he was behind it
after gazing out of the window for several moments palpatine turns to mace
master jedi may i suggest that the senator be placed under the protection of your graces
do you think that is a wise use of manpower during these stressful times
chancellor if i may comment i do not believe the
situation is that serious
no but i do senator
i dont want any more guards
i realise all too well that additional security might be disruptive for you but perhaps someone you are familiar with
an old friend like
palpatine nods to mace windu who nods back
he has just returned from a border dispute on ansion
you must remember him mlady
he watched over you during the blockade conflict
this is not necessary chancellor
do it for me mlady please
i will rest easier
we had a big scare today
the thought of losing you is unbearable
amidala sighs as the jedi get up to leave
i will have obi wan report to you immediately mlady
yoda leans into her ear
too little about yourself you worry senator and too much about politics
be mindful of your danger padme
accept our help
as the jedi leave the office palpatine continues to pace behind his desk
i will not like this republiv that has stood for over a thousand years be split in two a graceful skyscraper twinkles in the evening light of coruscant
the door to the apartment slides open
jar jar walks into the corridor where two jedi are exiting the elevator
he recognises obi wan and becomes extremely excited jumping around shaking his hand
mesa sooo smilen to seeen yousa
obi wan smiles
its good to see you too jar jar
wheresa mesa manners
excuse me master obi wan
i completely forgot myself for a moment there
i have had to learn diplodiaclect
speak it like a native now
dont really see the point actually but members of the senate seem to prefer it
jar jar notices obi wans apprentice
continuing and this i take it is your apprentice
little bitty annie
looks at anakin nooooooo
yousa so biggen
mesa no believen
hi jar jar
jar jar grabs hold of anakin and envelops him in a big hug
padme is in a conference with captain typho and dorme
jar jar enters the room followed by the two jedi
oh dear im afraid ive forgotten myself again
padme and typho rise as obi wan and anakin stop before the senator
obi wan steps forward
anakin stares at padme
she glances at him
its a great pleasure to see you again mlady
it has been far too long master kenobi
im so glad our paths have crossed again
but i must warn you that i think your presence here is unnecessary
im sure the jedi council have their reasons
she moves in front of anakin annie
stares my goodness youve grown
they look at each other for a long moment
trying to be smooth so have you
grown more beautiful i mean
and much shorter
for a senator i mean
obi wan looks disapprovingly at his apprentice
padme laughs and shakes her head
oh annie youll always be that little boy i knew on tatooine
this embarrasses anakin and he looks down
obi wan and captain typho smile
our presence will be invisible mlady
i am very grateful you are here master kenobi
the situation is more dangerous than the senator will admit
i dont need more security i need answers
i want to know who is trying to kill me
frowning were here to protect you senator not to start an investigation
we will find out who is trying to kill you padme i promise you
hes done it again
he bites his lip in frustration and shame
obi wan gives anakin a dirty look
we are not going to exceed our mandate my young padawan learner
i meant in the interest of protecting her master of course
we are not going through this exercise again anakin
you will pay attention to my lead
why else do you think we were assigned to her if not to find the killer
protection is a job for local security
its overkill master
investigation is implied in our mandate
we will do as the council has instructed and you will learn your place young one
perhaps with merely your presence the mysteries surrounding this threat will be revealed
now if you will excuse me i will retire
everyone gives amidala a slight bow as she and dorme leave the room
well i know i feel a lot better having you here
ill have an officer on every floor and ill be at the command centre downstairs
mesa busten wit happiness seein yousa again annie
deesa bad times bombad times
captain typho leaves
she didnt even recognise me jar jar
i thought about her every day since we parted
and shes forgotten me completely
happier den mesa see en her in longo time
anakin youre focusing on the negative again
be mindful of your thoughts
she was glad to see us
now lets check the security here
yes my master
the vast jedi temple sits on an endless flat plain silhouetted by a against the traffic filled sky
mace windu and yoda walk down the long hallways silhouetted by a lit room at the end
why couldnt we see this attack on the senator
masking the future is this disturbance in the force
the propecy is coming true the dark side is growing
and only those who have turned to the dark side can sense the possibilities of the future
only going through the dark side can we see
its been ten years and the sith still have no shown themselves
do you think they are behind this
out there they are
a certainty that is
do you think obi wans apprentice will be able to bring balance to the force
only if he chooses to follow his destiny
there is a long silence as they walk away
only footsteps are heard
padme is asleep in her bed lit only by the light of the city outside her window coming through the blinds
artoo stands in the corner of the bedroom
his power is off
anakin is standing in the living room
he is in a meditative state
it is quiet
we hear distant footsteps in the corridor outside the apartment
suddenly anakins eyes pop open
his eyes dart around the room
he reaches for his lightsaber then smiles and puts it back in his belt
the door to the apartment slides open and obi wan enters
captain typho has more than enough men downstairs
no assassin will try that way
any activity up here
quiet as a tomb
i dont like just waiting here for something to happen to her
obi wan checks a palm sized view scanner he has pulled out of his utility belt
it shows a shot of artoo by the door but no sign of padme on the bed
whats going on
she covered that camera
i dont think she liked me watching her
what is she thinking
she programmed artoo to warn us if theres an intruder
its not an intruder im worried about
there are many other ways to kill a senator
i know but we also want to catch this assassin
dont we master
youre using her as bait
it was her idea
no harm will come to her
i can sense everything going on in that room
its too risky
and your senses arent that attuned young apprentice
and yours are
as padme sleeps a probe droid approaches outside her window
it sends out several small arms that attach to the window creating sparks that shut down the security system
then a large arm cuts a small hole in the glass
a faint sound is heard as the small section of glass is removed from the window
artoo wakes up and his lights go on
the probe droid freezes
artoo looks around makes a plaintive little sound then shuts down again
the probe droid attaches a little tube to the window
two deadly looking centipede like kouhuns exit the tube crawl through the blinds and head toward the sleeping padme
anakin and obi wan continue their conversation in the main room of the apartment
you look tired
i dont sleep well anymore
because of your mother
i dont know why i keep dreaming about her now
i havent seen her since i was little
dreams pass in time
id rather dream of padme
just being around her again is
mind your thoughts anakin they betray you
youve made a commitment to the jedi order
a commitment not easily broken
and dont forget shes a politician
theyre not to be trusted
shes not like the others in the senate master
its been my experience that senators are only focused on pleasing those who fund their campaigns
and they are more than willing to forget the niceties of democracy to get those funds
not another lecture master
not on the economics of politics
its too early in the morning
and besides youre generalising
the chancellor doesnt appear to be corrupt
palpatines a politician ive observed that he is very clever at following the passions and prejudices of the senators
i think he is a good man
my instincts are very positive about
anakin looks stunned
he looks sharply at obi wan i sense it too
artoo sounds an alarm and shines a light on the bed
the kouhuns are inches from padmes face
their mouths are open and wicked stinger tongues flick out
obi wan and anakin burst into the room
the kouhuns stand on their hind legs and hiss as padme wakes up
anakin throws himself in front of her whacking in half the deadly creatures with his lightsaber
obi wan sees the droid outside the window and raqces straight at it crashing through the blinds as he goes through the window
obi wan flies through the glass window and flings himself at the probe droid grabbing onto the deadly machine before it can flee
the probe droid sinks under the weight of obi wan but manages to stay afloat and fly away with the jedi hanging on for dear life a hundred stories above
anakin and padme stare at the sight of obi wan being carried off by the droid
anakin turns to her
she pulls her nightdress around her shoulders
captain typho with two guards and dorme enter the room as anakin dashes out
the probe droid sends several protective electrical shocks across its surface causing obi wan to almost lose his grip
as they dart in and out of the speeder traffic obi wan disconnects a wire on the back of the droid
its power shuts off
obi wan and the droid drop like rocks
obi wan realises the error of his ways and quickly puts the wire back
the droids systems light up again and it takes off
anakin charges out of the building and runs to a line of parked speeders
he vaults into an open one and takes off gunning it fast toward the lines of speeder traffic high above
the droid bumps against a wall hoping to knock the jedi loose
it moves behind a speeder afterburner to scorch him
it takesthe jedi wildly between buildings and finally skims across a rooftop as obi wan is forced to lift his legs tenaciously hanging onto the droid
the droid heads for a dirty beat up speeder hidden in an alcove of a building about twenty stories up
when the pilot of the speeder a scruffy bounty hunter called zam wesell sees the droid approach with obi wan hanging on she pulls a long rifle out of the
speeder and starts to fire at the jedi
explosions burst all around obi wan
i have a bad feeling about this
finally the droid suffers a direct hit and blows up
obi wan falls fifty stories until a speeder drops down next to him and he manages to grab onto the back end of the speeder and haul himself toward the
the jedi struggles to climb into the passenger seat of the open speeder and sit down next to the driver anakin
that was wacky
i almost lost you in the traffic
what took you so long
oh you know master i couldnt find a speeder i really liked with an open cockpit
and with the right speed capabilities
and then you know i had to get a really gonzo color
they zoom upward in hot pursuit of zam asshe fires out the open window at them with her laser pistol
if youd spend as much time working on your saber skills as you do on your wit young padawan you would rival master yoda as a swordsman
i thought i already did
only in your mind my very young apprentice
as this conversation is going on anakin deftly moves in and out of the oncoming traffic across lanes between buildings and miraculously through a construction site
zam wesell continues firing at them
sorry i forgot you dont like flying master
i dont mind flying
but what youre doing is suicide
they barely miss a commuter train master you know ive been flying since before i could walk
im very good at this
just slow down
zam wessel and the jedi race through a line of cross traffic made up of giant trucks
the speeders bank sideways as they slide around right angle turns between buildings
zam races into a tram tunnel
dont go in there
anakin zooms into the tunnel after zam
they see a tram coming at them
they brake turn around and race out barely ahead of the charging commuter transport
continuing you know i dont like it when you do that
dont worry this guys gonna kill himself any minute now
zam wessel turns into oncoming traffic deliberately trying to throw the jedi off
oncoming speeders swerve trying to avoid zam and the jedi
zam does a quick tight loop over and ends up behind the jedi
she is now in a much better position to fire at them with her laser pistol
to avoid being hit by the laser bolts anakin slams on the brakes and moves alongside zam
she now fires point blank at obi wan
what are you doing
hes gonna blast me
right this isnt working
anakin slides underneath zams speeder
they race along in traffic one speeder right on top of the other
the bounty hunter skims over the rooftops causing anakin to drop behind
anakin goes through his gears zooming around traffic
they race at high speed across a wide flat surface of the city planet
a large spacecraft almost collides with them as it attempts to land
they round a corner and clip a flag which gets caught on one of the front air scoops
that was too close
clear the flag
were losing power
obi wan leans out of the speeder then crawls out onto the front engine pulling the flag free of the scoop
the speeder lurches forward with a surge of power
dont do that
i dont like it when you do that
so sorry master
they chase the bounty hunter through a power refinery
its dangerous near those power couplings
dont go through there
huge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the speeders pass
continuing yiiii what are you doing
sarcastically oh that was good
that was crazy
zam slides around a corner sideways blocking an alley firing point blank as anakin approaches
continuing ahh damn
no we can make it
anakin barely misses the bounty hunters speeder as he dives under it and through a small gap in the building hitting several pipes and going wildly out of control
anakin struggles to regain control of the speeder narrowly missing a crane barely clipping a pair of giant struts
a giant gasball shoots up causing anakin to spin and bump a building stalling the speeder
but it worked
we made it
angrily it didnt work
and you almost got us killed
i think were still alive
anakin works to get the speeder started
it quickly races to life
very angrily it was stupid
sheepishly i could have made it
furious but you didnt
and now weve lost him
suddenly there is an ambush
laser bolts fire everywhere
explosions surround them
they look up to see zam wessel take off
no we didnt
out of a cloud of smoke and ball of flames the jedi tear after zam
they are smoking
obi wan slaps out the small fire on the dashboard
zam goes up and down through cross traffic
there is a near miss as a speeder almost hits them
zam turns down and left between two buildings
anakin pulls up and to the right where are you going
he went down there the other way
this is a shortcut
what do you mean you think
what kind of shortcut
he went completely the other way
youve lost him
master if we keep this chase going that creeps gonna end up deep fried
personally id very much like to find out who in the hell he is and who hes working for
sarcastic oh so thats why were going in the wrong direction
anakin turns up a side street zooming up several small passageways then stops hovering about fifty stories up
continuing well you lost him
im deeply sorry master
anakin looks around front and back
he spots something
he seems to start counting to himself as he watches something below approach
continuing excuse me for a moment
anakin jumps out of the speeder
obi wan looks down and sees zams speeder about five stories below them cruising past
anakin miraculously lands on top of the bounty hunters speeder
the speeder wobbles under the impact
zam looks up and realises what has happened
zam takes off and anakin slides to the back strut and almost slips off but manages to hang on
anakin works his way back to the speeders cockpit just as zam stops suddenly and anakin flies forward to the left front fork
zam shoots at him with a laser pistol
there is a blast near anakins hand which breaks off a piece of the speeder
anakin slides to the right fork of the speeder where zam cant reach him
he scrambles to the top holding onto an air scoop
obi wan has jumped into the drivers seat of his speeder and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder
the two speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through cross traffic
finally anakin is able to get hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of the speeder
zam takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at the helpless jedi knocking the sword out of his hand
obi wan races under the speeder and catches the jedi weapon in the passengers seat
anakin sticks his hand into the cockpit and using the force pulls the gun out of zams hand
she grabs the jedis hand and they struggle for the weapon
it goes off blowing a hole in the floor of the speeder
the speeder careens wildly out of control
zam struggles to pull the speeder out of its nose dive
obi wan gets slowed down by traffic and loses sight of the bounty hunters speeder
just as the dragster is about to nose dive into the ground zam pulls it out and it slides hard on the pavement in a shower of sparks
anakin goes flying into the street
zam exits the crashed speeder and runs
anakin picks himself up off the pavement and runs down the very crowded street
its the seedy underbelly of the city
broken sidewalks garish lights reflected on the filthy puddles
its pretty crowded with various alien low lifes panhandling droids and the occasional group of upperclass slummers
anakin barges into several of them as he chases after the fleeing zam
he loses the bounty hunter in the crowd them sees him again
the young jedi is having a very difficult time getting through the crowd
ahead zam turns in through a door and disappears
a nightclub sighs is flashing over the door
anakin is just about to follow zam when there is a sudden swirl of litter from downthrusters
people start moving out of the way and the open speeder lands in the street beside him
obi wan gets out and walks over holding out anakins lightsaber
she went into that club master
obi wan hands anakin the lightsaber
next time try not to lose it
anakin reaches for the lightsaber but obi wan holds it back
a jedis saber is his most precious possession
he reaches for the lightsaber obi wan pulls it back
he must keep it with him at all times
i know master
this weapon is your life
ive heard this lesson before
obi wan finally holds out the lightsaber and anakin grabs it
but you havent learned anything anakin
i try master
obi wan and anakin enter the nightclub bar and everyone stares at them why do i think you are going to be the death of me
dont say that master
youre the closest thing i have to a father
i love you
i dont want to cause you pain
then why dont you listen to me
ill do better i promise
do you see him him
i think hes a she
then be extra careful
nods to a room check it out
obi wan goes away
where are you going master
to get a drink
obi wan heads for the bar
anakin blinks in surprise then moves into the room where alien faces look back at him with hostility suspicion and invitation as he moves among the tables
obi wan arrives at the bar
he signals the barman
close somewhere in the room a hand moves to a pistol in its holster and unsnaps the safety catch
at the bar a glass is placed in from of obi wan
a drink is poured
he lifts the glass
wanna buy some death sticks
obi wan looks at him
he moves his fingers slightly
you dont want to sell me death sticks
i dont want to sell you death sticks
obi wan moves his fingers
you want to go home and rethink your life
i want to go home and rethink my life
obi wan lifts the drink and tosses it back
the gun is drawn from its holster and held down out of sight
the bounty hunter starts to move toward the bar
anakin checks out alien faces
obi wan signals for another drink
the gun moves toward his unsuspecting back
the drink is poured
obi wan reaches for it
the gun is raised to aim directly at his back and suddenly obi wan turns fast
his lightsaber flashes
there is a shrill scream and zams arm hits the floor
the gun drops from its twitching fingers
the room is silent
aliens rise menacingly from their seats and anakin is suddenly at obi wans side his lightsaber glowing
go back to your drinks
slowly the aliens sit
onstage the performers pick up their routine
obi wan and anakin lift zam and carry her out
obi wan and anakin carry zam into the alley and lower her to the ground
obi wan attends to her wounded shoulder
she stares up hatefully at anakin
she winces in pain then nods
do you know who it was you were trying to kill
the senator from naboo
who hired you
zam glares at obi wan
it was just a job
that senators gonna die soon anyway and the next one wont make the same mistake i did
this wounds going to need treatment
who hired you
tell us now
zam glares hatefully
it was a bounty hunter called
there is a sudden ftzzz sound
she blinks in surprise and dies
there is a weoosh from above
obi wan and anakin look up yo see an armoured rocket man taking off from a roof high above
obi wan looks down at zam
he touches her neck and pulls out a small wicked looking dart
anakin and jar jar stand near the door of the anteroom to padmes bedroom
padme and dorme move about packing luggage
i know i can count on you
yousa betchen mesa bottums
coughs recovers oh pardone ay senator
i mean i am honoured to accept this heavy burden
i take on this responsibility with deep humility tinged with an overwhelming pride
pompously it is not every day that i am called upon to
padme kisses him on the cheek and gives him a hug
jar jar turns red
youre a good friend jar jar
i dont wish to hold you up
im sure you have a great deal to do
of course mlady
jar jar bows and goes out
as he passes anakin he flashes a dazzling smile
padme is in a very bad mood
i do not like this idea of hiding
now that the council has ordered an investigation it wont take master obi wan long to find that bounty hunter
frustrated i havent worked for a year to defeat the military creation act not to be here when its fate is decided
sometimes we have to let go of our pride and do what is requested of us
annie youre young and you dont have a very firm grip on politics
i suggest you reserve your opinions for some other time
i was only trying to
please dont call me that
ive always called you that
it is your name isnt it
when you say annie its like im still a little boy
and im not
im sorry anakin
its impossible to deny youve
looks him over that youve grown up
padme smiles at anakin
he becomes a little shy
master obi wan manages not to see it
mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like
its the only way we grow
dont get me wrong
obi wan is a great mentor
as wise as master yoda and as powerful as master windu
i am truly thankful to be his apprentice
although im a padawan learner in some ways
a lot of ways
im ahead of him
im ready for the trials
i know i am
he knows it too
he believes im too unpredictable
other jedi my age have gone through the trials and made it
i know i started my training late
but he wont let me move on
that must be frustrating
hes overly critical
he never listens
he just doesnt understand
its not fair
padme cannot surpress a laugh
she shakes her head
you sounded exactly like that little boy i once knew when he didnt get his way
im not whining
padme just smiles at him
dorme laughs in the background
i didnt say it to hurt you
there is a brief silence
padme comes over to anakin
they look into each others eyes for the first time
continuing dont try to grow up too fast
i am grown up
you said it yourself
anakin looks deep into padmes eyes
please dont look at me like that
because i can see what youre thinking
so you have jedi powers too
dorme is watching with concern
it makes me feel uncomfortable
anakin backs away as padme turns and goes back to her packing
a small bus speeds toward the massive freighter docks of coruscants industrial area
the spaceport is bustling with activity
transports of various sizes moves supplies and passengers as giant floating cranes lift cargo out of starships
the bus stops before a huge intergalactic freighter starship
it parks in the shadows of an overhang
anakin and padme dressed in outland peasant outfits get up and head for the door where captain typho dorme and obi wan are waiting to hand them their luggage
dorme is dressed to look like senator amidala
be safe mlady
thank you captain
take good care of dorme
the threats on you two now
hell be safe with me
they laugh and padme embraces her faithful handmaiden
dorme start to weep
youll be fine
its not me mlady
i worry about you
what if they realise im not you
looks to anakin then my jedi protector will have to prove how grown up he is
dorme and padme smile
anakin frowns as obi wan pulls him aside
anakin you stay put on naboo
do not attract any attention
do absolutely nothing without checking in with me or the council
to padme i will get to the bottom of this plot quickly mlady
youll be back here in no time
i will be most grateful for your speed master jedi
time to go
padme gives dorme a last hug
anakin picks up the luggage and the two peasants exit the speeder bus where artoo is waiting for them
may the force be with you
may the force be with you master
they head off toward the giant starfreighter
suddenly im afraid
im kinda scared too
this is my first assignment on my own
theres nothing to worry about
we have artoo with us
the two laugh
obi wan and captain typho watch anakin and padme disappear into the vastness of the spaceport with artoo trundling along behind them
i hope he doesnt try anything foolish
id be more concerned about her doing something than him
the freighter slowly takes off from the huge docks area of coruscant
it soon moves into the crowded skies
from high above light streams down from the lofty ceilings
obi wan crosses the floor of the great hallway heaading for the analysis rooms
obi wan walks past several glass cubicles where work is going on
he comes to an empty one and sits down in front of a console
a pk analysis droid comes to life
a tray slides out of the console
place the subject for analysis on the sensot tray please
obi wan puts the dart onto the traym which retracts into the console
the droid activates the system and a screen lights up in from of obi wan
its a toxic dart
i need to know where it came from and who made it
one moment please
appear on the screem scrolling past at great speed
obi wan watches as the screen goes blank
they tray slides out
continuing as you can see on your screen subject weapon does not exist in any known culture
markings cannot be identified
probablt self made by a warrior not associated with any known society
could you try again please
master jedi our records are very thorough
they cover eight percent of the galaxy
if i cant tell you where it came from nobody can
obi wan picks up the dart and looks at it then looks to the droid
thanks for your assistance
you may not be able to figure this out but i think i know someone who might
the massive slow moving freighter suddenly zooms away into lightspeed
the great gloomy hold is crowded with emigrants and their belongings
to one side artoo is coming to the head of a food line where servers are ladling out bowls of mush
artoo holds two bowls
artoo slips tube into a tub of mush and sucks up a large quantity
with one of his little claw arms he grabs several chunks of something that looks like brown bread
a server sees him
artoo takes one last big suck and heads away from the food line
the server shouts after him angrily
the little droid moves past groups of eating or sleeping emigrants and comes to where anakin is sound asleep
the young jedi seems to be having a nightmare
he is very restless
no no mom no
he is sweating
padme leans over to wipe some of the sweat from his forehead
he wakes up with a start then realises where he is
padme simply looks at him
he stares back somewhat confused
artoo fills up two bowls with mush
you seemed to be having a nightmare
anakin looks at padme a little more closely trying to see if he has revealed any of his secrets
she hands him a bowl of mush and bread
continuing are you hungry
we went into lightspeed a while ago
anakin looks into padmes eyes
i look forward to seeing naboo again
ive thought about it every day since i left
its by far the most beautiful place ive ever seen
padme is a little unnerved by his intense stare
you were just a little boy then
it may not be as you remember it time changes your perception
i think time has given me much more mature feelings to enhance my perception
it must be difficult having sworn your life to the jedi
not being able to visit the places you like
or do the things you like
or be with the people i love
are you allowed to love
i thought that was forbidden for a jedi
attachment is forbidden
possession is forbidden
compassion which i would define as unconditional love is central to a jedis life so you might say were encouraged to love
you have changed so much you havent changed a bit
youre exactly the way i remember you in my dreams
i doubt if naboo has changed much either
i cant wait to breathe the sweet breeze that comes off the rolling hills
whenever i try to visualise the force those hills are what i see
anakin looks at padme when he says this
continuing i love naboo
there is an awkward moment
changing the subject were you dreaming about you mother earlier werent you
i left tatooine so long ago my memory of her is fading
i dont want to lose it
recently ive been seeing her in my dreams
i worry about her
padme gives anakin a sympathetic look
obi wan walks down the street
it is a pretty tough part of town
old buildings warehouses beat up speeders and transporter rigs occasional shiny freighters hissing through
obi wan comes to a kind of alien diner
on the steamed up windowa it says dexs diner in alien lettering
he goes inside
a young waitress hermione bagwa is wiping off a booth tabletop
there is a counter with stools and a line of booths along the wall by the window
a number of customers are eating tough looking workers freighter drivers etc
hermione looks up as obi wan comes in
can i help ya
im looking for dexter
hermiones eyes narrow
waddya want him for
hes not in trouble
hermione stares at obi wan
there is a brief pause
then she goes to the open serving hatch behind the counter
someone to see ya honey lowering her voice a jedi by the looks of him
steam billows out from the kitchen hatch behind the counter as a huge head pokes through
take a seat
be right with ya
obi wan sits in a booth
you want a cup of ardees
hermione moves off as the door to the counter opens and dexter jettster appears
he is big bald and sweaty old and alien
not someone to tangle with
he arrives beaming hugely
hey ol buddy
dexter eases himself into the seat opposite obi wan
he can just make it
hermione sets two mugs of steaming ardees in from of them
so my friend
what can i do for ya
you can tell me what this is
obi wan places the dart on the table between them
dexs eyes widen
he puts down his mug
well whattaya know
dexter picks up the dart delicately between his puffy fingers and peers at it
continuing i aint seen one of these since i was prospecting on subterrel beyond the outer rim
do you know where it came from
he puts the dart down between them
this baby belongs to them cloners
what you got here is a kamino kyberdart
i wonder why it didnt show up in any analysis archive
its these funny little cuts on the side give it away
those analysis droids youve got over there only focus on symbols you know
i should think you jedi would have more respect for the difference between knowledge and wisdom
well dex if droids could think we wouldnt be here would we
doesnt sound familiar
is it part of the republic
no its beyond the outer rim
id say about twelve parsecs outside the rishi maze toward the south
it should be easy to find even for those droids in your archive to find
those kaminoans keep to themselves
damned good ones too
obi wan then picks up the dart holding it midway between them
are they friendly
on what dex
on how good your manners are
and how big your pocketbook is
the starfreighter lands in the giant port city of theed
padme anakin and artoo are among the emigrants streaming from the starfreighter and into the vast docking area
they exit onto the main plaza
the speeder bus pulls up and stops
padme anakin and artoo get out
the great courtyard stretches out before them and they see the rose colored dome of the palace on the far side
they pick up their gear and start to cross the courtyard
artoo trundles behind them
if i grew up here i dont think id ever leave
laughing i doubt that
when i started my training i was very homesick and very lonely
this city and my mom were the only pleasant things i had to think about
the problem was the more i thought about my mom the worse i felt
but i would feel better if i thought about the palace the way it shimmers in the sunlight the way the air always smells of flowers
and the soft sound of the distant waterfalls
the first time i saw the capital i was very young
id never seen a waterfall before
i though they were so beautiful
i never dreamed one day id live in the palace
well tell me did you dream of power and politics when you were a little girl
that was the last thing i thought of
my dream was to help in the refugee relief movement
i never thought of running for elected office
but the more history i studied the more i realised how much good politicians could do
so when i was eight i joined the apprentice legislators then later on became a senatorial advisor with such a passion that before i knew it i was elected queen
partly because i scored so high on my education certificate but for the most part it was my conviction that reform was possible
i wasnt the youngest queen ever elected but now that i think back on it im not sure i was old enough
im not sure i was ready
the people you served thought you did a good job
i heard they tried to amend the constitution so you could stay in office
popular rule is not democracy annie
it gives the people what they want not what they need
and truthfully i was relieved when my two terms were up
so were my parents
they worried about me during the blockade and couldnt wait for it all to be over
actually i was hoping to have a family by now
my sisters have the most amazing wonderful kids
but when the queen asked me to serve as senator i couldnt refuse her
i think the republic needs you
im glad you chose to serve
i feel things are going to happen in our generation that will change the galaxy in profound ways
i think so too
anakin and padme walk toward the palace
artoo continues to follow
quen jamillia is seated on the throne flanked by sio bibble and a couple of advisors
four handmaidens stand close by and guards are at the doors
weve been worried about you
takes her hand im so glad youre safe padme
thank you your highness
i only wish i could have served you better by staying on coruscant for the vote
given the circumstances senator you know it was the only decision her highness could have made
how many systems have joined count dooku and the separatists
about two hundred
and more are leaving the republic every day
if the senate votes to create an army im sure its going to push us into a civil war
there hasnt been a full scale war since the formation of the republic
do you see any way through negotiations to bring the separatists back into the republic
not if they feel threatened
the separatists dont have an army but if they are provoked they will move to defend themselves
im sure of that
and with no time or money to build an army my guess is they will turn to the commerce guilds or the trade federation for help
the armies of commerce
why has nothing been done in the senate to restrain them
im afraid that despite the chancellors best efforts there are still many bureaucrats judges and even senators on the payrolls of the guilds
after all of those hearings and the four trials in the supreme court nute gunray is still the viceroy of the trade federation
do those money mongers control everything
remember counsellor the courts were able to reduce the federations armies
thats a move in the right direction
there are rumours your highness that the federation army was not reduced as they were ordered
the jedi have not been allowed to investigate
it would be to be too dangerous for the economy we were told
we must keep our faith in the republic
the day we stop believing democracy can work is the day we lose it
lets pray that day never comes
in the meantime we must consider your own safety
sio bibble signals
all the other advisors and attendants bow and leave the room
to anakin what is your suggestion master jedi
anakins not a jedi yet counsellor
hes still a padawan learner
i was thinking
nettled hey hold on a minute
i was thinking i would stay in the lake country
there are some places up there that are very isolated
i am in charge of security here mlady
sio bibble and queen jamillia exchange a look
something is going on here
annie my life is at risk and this is my home
i know it very well
that is why were here
i think it would be wise for you to take advantage of my knowledge in this instance
takes a deep breath sorry mlady
to anakin amused she is right
the lake country is the most remote part of naboo
not many people and a clear view of the surrounding terrain
its settled then
anakin glares at padme
then queen jamillia gets up and they all start to leave
continued padme i had an audience with your father yesterday
i told him what was happening
he hopes you will visit your mother before you leave
your familys very worried about you
padme looks worred
they all exit down the main staircase
the main entrance at the base of the huge temple is bustling with activity
all sorts of jedi are coming and going
a bronze bust of count dooku stands among a line of other busts of jedi in the archive room
obi wan stands in front it studying the striking features of the chiselled face
on the walls lighted computer panels seem to stretch into infinity
farther along the room in the background five jedi are seated at tables studying archival material
after obi wan studies the bust for a few moments before madame jocasta nu the jedi archivist is standing next to him
she is an elderly frail looking human jedi
tough as old boots and smart as a whip
did you call for assistance
distracted in thought yes
yes i did
he has a powerful face doesnt he
he was one of the most brilliant jedi i have had the privilege of knowing
i never understood why he quit
only twenty jedi have ever left the order
sighs the lost twenty
and count dooku was the most recent and the most painful
no one likes to talk about it
his leaving was a great loss to the order
well one might say he was always a bit out of step with the decisions of the council
much like your old master qui gon jinn
they were alike in many ways
very individual thinkers
jocasta nu stares at the bust continuing he was always striving to become a more powerful jedi
he wanted to be the best
with a lightsaber in the old style of fencing he had no match
his knowledge of the force was
in the end i think he left because he lost faith in the republic
he believed that politics were corrupt and he felt the jedi betrayed themselves by serving the politicians
he always had very high expectations of government
he disappeared for nine or ten years then he just showed up recently as the head of the separatist movement
im still not sure i understand
well im sure you didnt call me over here for a history lesson
are you having a problem master kenobi
yes im trying to find a planet system called kamino
it doesnt seem to show upon any of the archive charts
its not a system im familiar with
let me see
jocasta nu leans over obi wans shoulder looking at the screen
continuing are you sure you have the right co ordinates
nodding according to my information it should be in this quadrant somewhere
just south of the rishi maze
jocasta nu taps the keyboard and frowns
no co ordinates
it sounds like the kind of directions youd get from a street tout
some old miner or furbog trader
all three actually
are you sure it exists
let me do a gravitational scan
obi wan and jocasta nu studt the star map hologram
there are some inconsistencies here
maybe the planet youre looking for was destroyed
wouldnt that be on record
it ought to be
unless it was very recent
shakes her head i hate to say it but it looks like the system youre searching for doesnt exist
perhaps the archives are incomplete
the archives are comprehensive and totally secure my young jedi
one thing you may be absolutely sure of if an item does not appear in our records it does not exist
obi wan stares at her then looks back at the map
people are passing through the little street old men are sunning themslves women are gossipping kids are playing
anakin padme and artoo turn onto a side street
anakin is back in his jedi robes
padme wear a beautiful simple dress
she stops beaming
theres my house
padme starts forward anakin hangs back
dont say youre shy
untruthfully no but i
suddenly there are shouts from two little girils ryoo age and pooja age
they come running toward padme
padme scoops up ryoo and pooja and hugs them
continuing im so happy to see you
this is anakin
anakin this is ryoo and this is pooja
anakin and the girls say hello shyly
as they see the droid they hug him
artoo whistles and beeps
anakin and padme go on toward the house
the girls stay and play with artoo
sola padmes beautiful older sister comes in from the kitchen carrying a big bowl of food
over her shoulder theyre eating over at jev narrans later mom
they just had a snack
theyll be fine
sola puts the bowl down on the table where anakin padme and ruwee naberrie padmes father are coming into the room
anakin this is my sister sola
sola sits as jobal naberrie padmes mother comes in with a heaped bowl of steaming food
youre just in time for dinner
i hope youre hungry anakin
hes being polite mom
grinning you came to the right place at the right time
sit down son
everyone sits and starts passing food
to padme honey its so good to see you safe
we were so worried
padme gives jobal a dirty look
ruwee smiles as he watches
i know i know
but i had to say it
now its done
well this is exciting
do you know anakin youre the first boyfriend my sisters ever brought home
rolls her eyes sola
he isnt my boyfriend
hes a jedi assigned by the senate to protect me
they didnt tell us it was that serious
its not mom i promise
glances at jobal anyway anakins a friend
ive known him for years
remember that little boy who was with the jedi during the blockade crisis
continuing he grew up
honey when are you going to settle down
havent you had enough of that life
i certainly have
mom im not in any danger
to anakin is she
im afraid she is
quickly but not much
anakin and ruwee are walking
sometimes i wish id traveled more
but i must say im happy here
padme tells me you teach at the university
nodding yes and before that i was a builder
i also worked for the refugee relief movement when i was very young
padme sola and jobal are clearing the table
why havent you told us about him
whats there to talk about
hes just a boy
have you seen the way he looks at you
sola stop it
its obvious he has feelings for you
are you saying little baby sister that you havent noticed
im not your baby sister sola
anakin and i are friends
our relationship is strictly professional
to jobal mom would you tell her to stop it
laughing well maybe you havent noticed the way he looks at you
i think youre afraid to
cut it out
solas just concerned
we all are
oh mom youre impossible
what im doing is important
youve done your service padme
its time you had a life of your own
youre missing so much
anakin and ruwee are walking in the garden
ruwee stops and faces anakin directly
now tell me son
how serious is this thing
how much danger is my daughter really in
there have been two attempts on her life
chances are therell be more
my master is tracking down the assassins
im sure hell find out who they are
this situation wont last long
i dont want anything to happen to her
i dont either
padme throws some things into a bag
dont worry this wont take long
i just want to get there before dark
padme goes on packing
anakin looks around the room
continuing you still live at home
i move around so much ive never had a place of my own
official residences have no warmth
i feel good here
i feel at home
i never had a real home
home was always where my mom was
anakin picks up a framed hologram
continuing is this you
the hologram shows padme at age seven or eight surrounded by forty or fifty little green creatures
she is holding one in her arms
they are all smiling hugely
that was when i went with the relief group to shadda bi boran
their sun was imploding and the planet was dying
i was helping to relocate the children
see that little one im holding
his name was na kee tula which means sweethear
he was so full of life
all those kids were
i did everything i could to save him but he died
they all did
they were never able to adapt
to live off their native planet
anakin picks up another hologram
it shows padme at age ten or eleven
she is wearing official robes and standing between two robed legislators
her expression is severe
continuing my first day as an apprentice legislator
notice the difference
padme pulls a face
she continues packing
anakin sets the two holograms down side by side the beaming little girl and the the stern unsmiling adolescent
obi wan walks through the main hallway to the training area
obi wan comes out onto the veranda and stops watching twenty or so four year olds doing training exercises supervised by yoda
they wear helmets over their eyes and try to strike little training droids with their miniature lightsabers
the droids dance in front of them
be as one with the force
help you it will
he sees obi wan younglings enough
a visitor we have
the children take off their helmets and turn off their lightsabers
continuing master obi wan kenobi meet the mighty bear clan
welcome master obi wan
i am sorry to disturb you master
what help to you can i be
im looking for a planet described to me by an old friend
i trust him
but the system doesnt show up on the archive maps
an interesting puzzle
gather round the map reader younglings
master obi wan has lost a planet
find it we will try
the map reader is a small shaft with a hollow opening at the top
the cchildren gather around it
obi wan takes out a little glass ball and places it into the bowl
the window shades close darkening the room and the reader lights up projecting the star map hologram into the room
the children laugh
some of them reach up to try and touch the nebulae and stars
obi wan walks into the display
this is where it ought to be
but it isnt
gravity is pulling all the stars in this area inward to this spot
there should be a star here
but there isnt
gravitys silhouette remains but the star and all its planets have disappeared
how can this be
there is a brief pause
then a child puts its hand up
because someone erased it from the archive memory
thats what happened
someone erased it
if the planet blew up the gravity would go away
obi wan stares yoda chuckles
truly wonderful the mind of a child is
to the centre of the pull of gravity go and find your planet you will
but master yoda who could have erased information from the archives
thats impossible isnt it
frowning much harder to answer that question is
a water speeder driven by paddy accu the retreat caretaker skims across the lake away from the island landing platform where a chrome naboo starship rests
anakin and padme are sitting in the speeder as it skims away to where a lodge rises on a beautiful island in the middle of the lake
anakin and padme walk up the stairs from where the water speeder is parked onto a terrace overlooking a lovely garden
behind them paddy accu supervises two serving girls nandi and teckla as they carry the bags into the lodge
anakin and padme stop at the balustrade
padme looks out across the garden to the shimmering lake and the mountains rising beyond
anakin looks at her silently
when i was in level three we used to come here for school retreat
see that island
we used to swim there every day
i love the water
i do too
i guess it comes from growing up on a desert planet
padme becomes aware that anakin is looking at her
we used to lie on the sand and let the sun dry us
and try to guess the names of the birds singing
i dont like sand
its coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere
not like here
here everythings soft
he touches her arm
padme has become receptive to the way he looks at her but is nervous
there was a very old man who lived on the island
he used to make glass out of sand and vases and necklaces out of the glass
they were magical
looks into her eyes everything here is magical
you could look into the glass and see the water
the way it ripples and moves
it looked so real
but it wasnt
sometimes when you believe something to be real it becomes real
real enough anyway
they look into each others eyes
he touches her chin
i used to think if you looked too deeply into glass you would lose yourself
i think its true
anakin kisses padme
she doesnt resist
she comes to her senses and pulls away
i shouldnt have done that
when im around you my mind is no longer my own
its the situation
he looks at her
obi wans starfighter is ready for takeoff
obi wan and mace windu stand beside it
be wary this disturbance in the force is growing stronger
i am concerned for my padawan
he is not ready to be on his own
the council is confident in this decision obi wan
he has exceptional skills
the council is confident in its decision obi wan
if the prophecy is true he weill be the one to bring balance to the force
but he still has much to learn
and his abilities have made him
i realise now what you and master yoda knew from the beginning
the boy was too old to start the training and
obi wan hesitates
theres something else
master he should not have been given this assignment
im afraid anakin wont be able to protect the senator
he has a
an emotional connection with her
its been there since he was boy
now hes confused
obi wan you must have faith that he will take the right path
obi wan climbs into the cockpit of the starfighter
has master yoda gained any insight into whether or not this war will come about
probing the dark side is a dangerous process
he could be in seclusion for days
may the force be with you
yoda sits with his eyes closed meditating
the setting sun touches the mountain peaks
the lake glows in the rose tinted light
floatinf lamps glean softly like jewels at the lodge
nandi place dessert in front of padme
teckla does the same for anakin
the dessert is some kind of fruit
padme picks up her fork and goes to spear a piece but it moves
she frowns and tries again the fruit moves
she lokk up at anakin
his eyes are on his plate
you did that
anakin looks up wide eyed innocence
padme scowls at him
padme jabs at the fruit anakin subtly moves his hand and it lifts up from the plate and hovers in front of her
now stop it
she reaches out for the fruit it loops
anakin moves his fingers
the fruit flies into his hand
im not really supposed to do that
for fun i mean
if master obi wan were here hed be very grumpy
anakin is pleased
he cuts the fruint into several pieces and sends one back to padme
she bites it out of the air and laughs
a fire blazes in the open hearth
padme is sitting in front of it gazing at the flames
she looks up as anakin arrives
she makes room for him
may i tell you something
i dont know
then how can i tell you
maybe you should use your jedi intuition
it doesnt work around you
my mind is always a muddle
i can only think of you
from the moment i met you all those years ago a day hasnt gone by when i havent thought of you
and now that im close to you again im in agony
the closer i get to you the worse it gets
the thought of not being with you mskes my stomach turn over my mouth goes dry
i feel dizzy
i cant breathe
im haunted by the kiss you should never have given me
my heart is beating hoping that kiss will not become a scar
you are in my very soul tormenting me
what can i do
i will do anything you ask
the logs flame in the hearth
continuing if you are suffering as much as i am tell me
its just not possible
padme please listen
we live in a real world
come back to it
youre studying to become a jedi knight
im a senator
if you follow your thoughts through to conclusion they will take us to a place we cannot go
regardless of the way we feel about each other
then you do feel something
theres an extraordinary connection between us
you cant deny that
annie it doesnt make any difference
jedi arent allowed to marry
you swore an oath remember
youd be expelled from the order
i will not let you give up your responsibilities
your future for me
i was destined to be a jedi
i dont think i could be anything else
but you are asking me to be rational
that is something i know i cannot do
i wish i could wish my feelings away
but i cant
i am not going to give into this
im not going to throw my life away
i have more important things to do than fall in love
there is silence as they stare at the fire
anakin is thinking
it wouldnt have to be that way
we could keep it a secret
then wed be living a lie one we couldnt keep even if we wanted to
mt sister saw it
so did my mother
i couldnt do that
could you anakin
could you live like that
silence for a moment
no youre right
it would destroy us
its just like the star map hologram plus the storm shrouded planet of kamino which is exactly where it ought to be
obi wans starship flies over camera and heads down toward the planet
heavy rans and hard driving winds lash the platform as obi wans starship approaches
the huge ultra modern city of tipoca rests on great stilts that keep it above the pounding and ever present waves that cover the surface of this watery world
the starfighter lands
obi wan gets out and makes his way through the bowling wind toward a tower on the far side of the platform
a door slides open
a shaft of brilliant light pierces the swirling rain
obi wan passes through it and goes inside
a brilliant white light
obi wan pushes the soaking hood from his face
welcome to tipoca city master jedi
obi wan wipes the rain from his face and blinks in surprise at a tall pasty white alien named taun we
he has large almond shaped eyes
everything is ready
the prime minister expects you
warily im expected
he is anxious to see you
after all these years we were beginning to think you werent coming
now please this way
obi wan masks his surprise as they move away along the corridor
obi wan follows taun we cautiously
the door slides open
obi wan and taun we enter and cross to where lama su rises smiling from behind his desk which like all the furniture on kamino seems made out of pure
may i present lama su prime minister of kamino
and this is master jedi
obi wan kenobi
lama su indicates a chair
obi wan sits
taun we hovers
the room is bathed in brilliant white light
the whole place is ultra high tech
i trust you are going to enjoy your stay
we are most happy you have arrived at the best part of the season
you make me feel most welcome
and now to business
you will be delighted to hear we are on schedule
two hundred thousand units are ready with another million well on the way
improvising that is
please tell your master sido dyas that we have every confidence his order will be met on time and in full
he is well i hope
im sorry master
jedi master sifo dyas
hes still a leading member of the jedi council is he not
rising you must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself
thats why im here
padme and anakin are in the middle of an idyllic hilly meadow its lush grasses sprinkled with flowers
at a distance a herd of shaaks graze contentedly
beyond is the shimmering expanse of the lake
several other lakes stretch to the horizon
the warm air is full of little floating puffballs
they sit on the grass in a playful coy mood talking
padme is picking flowers
i dont know
sure you do
you just dont want to tell me
are you going to use one of your jedi mind tricks on me
they only work on the weak minded
you are anything but weak minded
his name was palo
i was twelve
we were both in the legislative youth program
he was a few years older then i
dark curly hair
all right i get the picture
whatever happened to him
i went on to become a queen
he went on to become an artist
maybe he was the smart one
you really dont like politicians do you
i like two or three but im not really sure about one of them
smiling i dont think the system works
how would you have it work
we need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problems agree whats in the best interests of all the people and then do it
that is exactly what we do
the trouble is that people dont wlways agree
in fact they hardly ever do
then they should be made to
whos going to make them
i dont know
of course not me
that sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me
a mischievious little grin creeps across his face
well if it works
padme stares at anakin
he looks back at her straight faced and cant hold a smile
youre making fun of me
sarcastic on no id be much too frightened to tease a senator
youre so bad
padme picks up a piece of fruit and throws it at him
he catches it
padme throws two more pieces of fruit and anakin catches them
youre always so serious
always carrying the weight of the universe on your shoulders
anakin then starts to juggle the fruit
padme laughs and throws more fruit at him
he manages to juggle them too until there are too many and he loses control and ducks letting food fall on his head
they both laugh
anakin stands in front of a shaak yelling at it and waving his arms
padme starts laughing as anakin runs in circles chased by the shaak
the shaak crosses in front of padme
anakin is riding it facing the shaaks tail
the shaak bucks and anakin falls off
padme laughs even harder
anakin lies still
padme jumps uip and runs to where anakin is face down in the grass
she turns him over
he is pulling a stupid face at her
she yelps in mock fury and takes a swing at him
he catches her arm
they roll over in the grass
suddenly they become aware of the contact between them
they let go of each other quickly and sit up looking away
anakin stands up and holds out his hand to her
she take it
he pulls her up
and now they are easy together not self conscious any more
padme scrambles up onto the shaak behind anakin
she puts her arms around his waist and leans against his back
abajub digs his heels in
the shaak starts forward and they ride away
obi wan lama su and taun we come out onto a balcony
below is a huge parade ground
the rain and wind are brutal
thousands of stormtroopers faces covered by helmets are marching and drilling in formations of several hundred
beaming magnificent arent they
obi wan nods slowly
lama su conducts obi wan through a large eating area
taun we follows as they walk by hundreds of clones who look exactly alike all about twenty years old dressed in black
they are seated at tables eating
we modified their genetic structure to make them less independent than the original host
as a result they are totally obedient taking any order without question
who was the original host
a bounty hunter called jango fett
we felt a jedi would be the perfect choice but sido dyas hand picked jango fett himself
where is this bounty hunter now
oh we keep him here
after a few hundred thousand clones the genetic pattern starts to fade so we take a fresh supply
he lives here but hes free to come and go as he pleases
the tour continues through a long corridor folled with narrow transparent tubes into which clones are climbing
once in the tube the clone goes to sleep
apart from his pay which is considerable fett demanded only one thing an unaltered clone for himself
curious isnt it
pure genetic replication
no tampering with the structure to make it more docile
and no growth acceleration
i would like to meet this jango fett
i would be most happy to arrange it for you
taun we bows and leaves
the tour continues through a classroom filled with identical young boy clones
you mentioned growth acceleration
oh yes its essential
otherwise a mature clone would take a lifetime to grow
now we can do it in half the time
those items you saw on the parade ground were started ten years ago when sido dyas first placed the order and theyre already mature
obi wan looks at the boy clones
about five years ago
they enter a space filled with great racks of glass spheres which are filled with fluid in which embryos are suspended
theyre immensely superior to droids capable of independent thought and action
id hoped you would be pleased
obi wan gazes at the nearest embryos
carefully tell me prime minister when my master sido dyas first contacted you did he say the order was for
of course not
this army is for the republic
astonished the repubic
we are also very much agasint this count dooku and his seccessionist movement
we are proud to be of help to the republic
taun we shows obi wan into his room
i have arranged for you to meet jango fett in the morning
taun we goes
the door slides closed behind him
obi wan looks around then moves swiftly to check the room over
finally satisfied he takes out his comlink
the r d obi wans astro droid who is sitting on top of obi wans starfighter switches on and beeps
obi wan hears arfour beep through his comlink
arfour relay this scramble code five to courscant care of the old folks home
arfour beeps and whistles
the panels light up inside the cockpit as the message is transmitted
yoda and mace windu listen as a hologram of obi wan stands between them broadcasting the massage
the singnal is very weak the image fades in and out
ive never heard of a jedi called sido dyas have you master
whoever placed that order was not a jedi i can assure you
i have a strong feeling that this bounty hunter is the assassin were looking for
who he is working for
discover that you must
i will master and i will also find out more about this clone army
may the force
the hologram switches off and obi wan fades away
a clone army
ordered by someone in the senate perhaps
someones out to start a war
inform the chancellor of this we must
who do you think this impostor sido dyas could be
yoda stares back at mace windu then slowly shakes his head
the silent lodge
the triple moons of naboo reflected in the tranquil waters of the lake
anakin moves restlessly in his sleep
he mutters to himself
sweat forms on his forehead
he turns violently
he cries out
dont no dont
anakin is on the balcony overlooking the gardens
after a moment pamde comes onto the balcony behind him
she sees he is meditating and turns to go
eyes closed dont go
i dont want to disturb you
your presence is soothing
you had a nightmare again last night
jedi dont have nightmares
i heard you
anakins opens his eyes and looks at her
i saw my mother
i saw her as clearly as i see you now
shes suffering padme
she is in pain
theyre killing her
getting up i know im disobeying my mandate to protect you senator
i know i will be punished and possibly thrown out of the jedi order but i must go
i have to help her
im sorry padme
i dont have a choice
annie i told you i wouldnt let you give up your future for me
ill go with you
that way you can continue to protect me and you wont be disobeying your mandate
what about master obi wan
padme smiles and takes his hand
i guess we wont tell him will we
anakin and padme step onto the landing platform from the water speeder
they enter the naboo starship
artoo beeps and follows them on board
the ramp retracts
paddy accu drives the water speeder away from the platform as anakins starship takes off
rain lashes the city
below mightly waves pound the stilts breaking almost to the height of the platforms
taun we conducts obi wan to the door of jango fetts apartment
taun we waves his hand and a muted bell rings
as they wait obi wan notes the door lock entry mechanism
then the door opens and a ten year old boy boba fett looks at them
he is identical to the boys in the classroom
boba is your father here
there is a brief pause then boba fett nods
continuing may we see him
another brief pause then boba fett steps aside and taun we and obi wan go through
obi wan taun we and boba fett enter the apartment
obi wan looks around the room
taun wes here
jango fett comes in from the bedroom
he wears a jumpsuit
he is unshaven and mean looking his face pitted with scars of old wounds
there are a couple of weird tattoos on his muscular forearms
he eyes obi wan with suspicion
welcome back jango
was your trip productive
obi wan and jango fett size each other up
boba fett studies both of them
this is jedi master obi wan kenobi
hes come to check on our progress
jango fetts eyes fix obi wan coldly
your clones are very impressive
you must be very proud
im just a simple man trying to make my way in the universe master jedi
arent we all
obi wan eyes the half open bedroom door through which a couple of pieces of body armour can be seen on the floor
jango fett registers obi wans look
he moves in front of him blocking the view
continuing ever made your way as far into the interior as coruscant
once or twice
eyes obi wan carefully possibly
then you must know master sido dyas
boba close the door
boba fett moves to close the bedroom door
jango fett smiles thinly at obi wan
continuing master who
isnt he the jedi who hired you for this job
never heard of him
i was recuited by a man called darth tyranus on one of the moons of bogden
sido dyas told us to expect him
and he showed up just when your jedi master said he would
we have kept the jedis involvement a secret until your arrival just as your master requested
do you like your army
it seems to me its your army being that they are all clones of you
grinning theyll do their job well ill guarantee that
i look forward to seeing them in action
thank you for your time jango
always a pleasure to meet a jedi
obi wan and taun we go out
the door slides closed
jango fett turns to his son
he is deep in thought
what is it dad
the naboo starship heads toward the desert planet of tatooine
the naboo starship lands in a large parking lot of spaceships on the outskirts of mos espa
anakin and padme ride a rickshaw through the streets
anakin stares at sights he hasnt seen for years
finally they come to wattos shop and the rickshaw stops
to the droid driver wait please
anakin and padme get down
sitting on a stool in front of the shop is watto
he is using a small electronic screwdriver on a fiddly droid
three pit droids are chattering away and are trying to help him but they seem only to make him madder
yelling in huttese no not that one that one
arriving excuse me watto
in huttese what
in huttese i said excuse me
watto turns to the chattering pit droids
in huttese shut down
the pit droids snap into their storage position
continuing in huttese what
i dont know you
what can i do for you
you look like a jedi
whatever it is
i didnt do it
watto drops the screwdriver and curses loudly in huttese let me help you with that
anakin takes the fiddly piece of equipment and starts to play with it
watto blinks in surprise
continuing im looking for shmi skywalker
watto looks at him suspiciously
he stares at padme then back to anakin
suddenly the fiddly piece of equipment in anakins hands whirs into life
watto blinks at it
continuing in english you are annie
it is you
you little womp rat
watto gives anakin a big hug
continuing you sure sprouted weehoo
hey maybe you couldda help wit some daedbeats who owe
shes not mine no more
i sold her
sorry anne but you know business is business
sold her to a moisture farmer named lars
least i think it was lars
believe it or not i heard he freed her and married her
can ya beat that
do you know where they are
long way from here
someplace over on the other side of mos eisley i think
id like to know
anakins grim look means business watto gets the hint quickly
lets go look in my records
anakin and watto go into the shop
the waves crash against the water city as the storm continues
light suddenlyt streams from the base of a landing platform as a door slides open
obi wan stands with lama su and taun we just inside the open door
tell your council the first battalions are ready
and remind them that if they need more troops we will need time to grow them
i wont forget
obi wan comes out from the tower into the driving ran
the door closes behind him
he pulls his robe around him and stands braced against the gale
below a huge wave crashes against the stilts
spray flies high and whips across the platform where obi wan is standing
he walks over to his starfighter looks to see if anyone is watching then turns and goes back to the door
it slides open
obi wan enters cautiously from outside
ahead the corridor is deserted
he moves down it
obi wan walks in to find the room in complete disorder
the bedroom door is wide open clear signs of hurried departure
all of the fetts personal belongings are gone
obi wan goes to an ultra thin computer screen
he punches up an onscreen picture of jango fett and boba fett unhitching the lines securing their ship to the landing platform
jango fett is wearing his armour and rocket pack
boba fett climbs aboard the small fighter
jango fett picks up a case and swings it up to boba fett who stows it inside the ship
jango fett picks up another case and is about to swing it when dad
jango fett turns to see obi wan charging out of the tower toward him
as he runs obi wan draws his lightsaber from his belt
it flashes on
jango fett draws his gun and fires at the charging jedi
obi wan deflects the blast and swings at jango fett
the bounty hunter rockets up and over obi wan landing behind him
he fires a thin wire from his wrist pack trying to entangle the jedi
jango fett fire several kamino kyber darts from his elbow launcher
obi wan deflects them back at jango fett but they strike harmlessly against the bounty hunters armour
in the cockpit of jango fetts ship boba fett grabs the controls of a laser gun and swings it to aim at obi wan
outside in the driving rain obi wan and jango fett circle each other sizing each other up feinting
in the cockpit each time boba fett is ready to fire jango fett blocks his view of obi wan
outside obi wan makes a sudden attack swinging at jango fett who deflects the blows
one slices off a piece of the bounty hunters shoulder plate
jango fett rockets into the air and hovers above obi wan
the jedi spins as in the cockpit boba fett fires
outside the laser shell streaks past obi wan to strike the edge of the tower
jango fett fires down at obi wan
the jedi deflects the shots back but jango fett evades them
then he swoops down swinging around obi wan
as he shoots past he kicks the lightsaber out of the jedis hand
the lightsaber skids across the wet surface of the landing platform
obi wan dives after it
jango fett zooms in front of him and grabs the lightsaber
obi wan punches it out of his hand
in the cockpit boba fett watches as outside obi wan and jango fett grapple and fight punching kicking grabbing hold and throwing each other around
obi wan grabs jango fett tightly and jango fett rockets up into the air and kicks obi wan loose
obi wan crashes to the deck and slides toward the edge
he grapples desperately for a handhold on the slick surface
jango fett rockets down to kick at him
obi wan hauls himself up
jango fett zooms to the far side of the platform
obi wan uses jedi powers to pull part of the structure loose
it hits jango fett who loses his balance teetering on the edge
obi wan charges acress dives and grabs hold of jango fett just as he falls over the edge
locked together obi wan and jango fett plummet down toward the raging ocean
at the last moment jango fett fires a cable out of his backpack that shoots upward and locks onto a metal strut on the underside of the platform
obi wan and jango fett swing and crash onto one of the stilts
obi wan is knocked clear and drops onto a small service platform just above the waves
he hauls himself to his feet
jango fett hovers in mid air opposite him as a huge wave crashes over obi wan
when it subsides the jedi has disappeared
jango fett rockets up to the landing platform where he drops down beside his ship
he clambers inside the cockpit and settles into the pilots seat
he punches buttons
the engines roar
outside jango fetts ship lifts off from the platform and heads up into the lowering sky
rain lashes the tower and streams across the surface of the platform to where a hand suddenlt clutches at the very edge of the platform
a moment later another hand grabs hold
the naboo starship descends hovers and land on a bluff
anakin and padme get out
they look down from the edge of the bluff to where the homestead is seen on the desert floor below
stay with the ship artoo
artoo whistles as anakin and padme start down the trail toward the homestead
c po is working outside the homestead
he still lacks an outer covering his inner parts and wiring show
he looks up as anakin and padme arrive good evening
may i help you
my goodness i can hardly believe it
and this must be miss padme
ive come to see my mother
im so terribly sorry master annie
threepio whats happened
i think wed better go inside
anakin padme and threepio arrive in the courtyard
threepio shuffles ahead
master lars master owen
somebody to see you
owen lars and beru whitesun come out into the courtyard
im anakin skywalker
im here looking for my mother
i guess im your step brother
they shake hands this is my girlfriend beru
i had a feeling you might show up some day
is my mother here
no shes not
cliegg lars swings from the house on a small floating chair
one of his legs is heavily bandaged the other is missing
he balances awkwardly and puts out a hand
continuing cliegg lars
shmi is my wife
come on inside
we have a lot to talk about
beru puts several steaming cups of ardees on a tray and exits the kitchen
it was just before dawn
they came out of nowhere
a hunting party of tusekn raiders
cliegg owen padme and anakin sit around the table beru brings the drinks from the kitchen
your mother had gone out early like she always did to pick mushrooms that grow on the vaporatos
from the tracks she was about halfway when they took her
those tuskens walk like men but theyre vicious mindless monsters
thirty of us went out after her
four of us came back
three more are still out there looking
id be with them only
i just couldnt ride any more
until i heal
cliegg grimaces easing his throbbing leg
continuing this isnt the way i wanted to meet you son
this isnt how your mother and i planned it
i dont want to give up on her but shes been gone a month
theres little hope shes lasted this long
then anakin stands up
where are you going
to find my mother
shes daed son
i can feel her pain and i will find her
i know shes alive
anakin turns abruptly
anakin stands looking across the desert
padme comes running out of the homestead after him followed by owen
anakin turns to padme
you are going to have to stay here
these are good people padme
youll be safe
take my speeder bike
padme hugs him
anakin walks over to owens speeder bike which is standing close by
i trust youll watch over her owen
anakin swings onto the bike
the engine fires
i wont be long
anakin takes off across the desert
padme watches him go
the red planet of geonosis is circled by a large asteroid field that form rings
jango fetts ship appears heading toward it
jango fett grins at boba fett
nearly there son
jango fett guides he ship around the asteroids
suddenly dad look
on the view screen obi wans ship appears chasing after them
jango fett grabs the controls
they are thrown around as the ship plummets to try to lose obi wan
the ship goes into a power climb
a great space ddogfight ensues between obi wan and jango fett
the ships flip roll and turn at incredible speed didging weaving and firing
they tumble from near misses
hits fly off obi wans fighter as one of jangos missiles gets through
finally it seems as if obi wan is getting the upper hand
jango fett breaks off the fight and dives sharply
he maneuvers deftly between two huge asteroids
in jango fetts cockpit boba fett flinches as asteroids pass very close by
stay calm son
well be fine
that jedi wont be able to follow us through this
but obi wan ship dives into the asteroid belt after them
in obi wans cockpit his skill is pushed to the limit as he throws the ship from side to side avoiding great rocks
then a huge asteroid tumbles across his path
there seem no way he can avoid it
obi wan fires a couple of aerial torpedoes
they streak toward the asteroid
in jangos cockpit they see the huge explosion as obi wans ship appears to smash into the asteroid
we wont see him again
boba fett laughs
jango fetts ship emerges from the asteroid belt and heads down toward the planet of geonosis
anakin stands in the middle of a crowd of jawas
he asks them from directions
the jawas confer exicitedly then the chief jawa points in a particular direction
anakin gets on the bike and speeds off to where the jawa pointed
anakin rides over a large dune toward a small flickering light in the distance
he rides up and stops the bike in front of a campfire
there are bodies of three dead farmers lying beside the campfire
two eopies are thethered nearby along with a burned and smoking speeder
three different shots
anakin rids the speeder bike through three exotic landscapes
in one shot he stops and looks down at some tracks
then he starts up his speeder and rides off
the lights of the vaporators blink in the night sky
somewhere close by a night animal howls
padme is pacing the courtyard restlessly
she stops listening to the animal howling nearby
she shivers slightly then turns and goes into the garage at the side of the courtyard
padme stands looking at a speeder parked in the garage
then please dont leave us miss padme
these people need your help
threepio is parked in a corner
im not leaving threepio
i just cant sleep
thats something i cannot relate to
as a protocol droid im either active or inactive
theres no in between
i guess youre lucky
do you really think so
i suppose i shouldnt expect
youre not happy here
oh im not unhappy
and my masters here ar so kind i wouldnt wish to trouuble them its just
being like this
well its embarrassing
being like what
if you pardon the expression
you see when master annie made me he never quite found the time to give me any outer covering
its so humiliating
how would you like it if you had to go around with all your circuits showing
i guess i wouldnt like it at all
of course you wouldnt
its simply not protocol
padme looks thoughtfully at a pile of spare parts and bits of metal and tools
maybe we can do something about it
i dont think so
only master annie
they seem to have a box of old coverings here
how observant of you miss padme
of course im just not mechanically minded
if you see what i mean
padme picks up a piece of metal and holds it against him
lets see if we put this
youll have to be quiet threepio
hold still please
a huge chunk of rock tumbles slowly through the asteroid bely
camera closes to discover obi wans starship hidden in a blasted out area on the pitted back side of the great rock
obi wan looks out toward geonosis and sees in the distance a large fleet of trade federation ships hidden among the asteroids
he starts the engines of his fighter
obi wans fighter moves out from the back side of the asteroid and heads away from the asteroid field descending toward geonosis
obi wans ship skims across the top of a small mesa along the edge of a rocky ridge
he maneuvers under a rock overhang and lands
he gets out of the fighter and walks onto the mesa
the wind whips at him
he looks around
geonosis is a red rock planet featureless apart from buttes and mesas and occasional tall stalagmites that stand out dramatically on the arid plains
the night is quiet except for an occasional weird cry
obi wan checks his bearings then heads away
obi wan climbs a steep narrow trail
suddenly a cry is heard close by
obi wan stumbles slightly
his foot slips on the edge sending a stream of peblles skittering into the darkness
obi wan listens
he draws his lightsaber but does not ignite it
he sets off again and works his way around a narrow corner to confront a crouching massiff a dog sized lizard with slavering fangs
the beast leaps at him and obi wan ignites his lightsaber as the massiff knocks him on his back
its jaws open wide
obi wan stabs the creature throws it off of him and jumps up
a second massiff jumps from behind
obi wan swings around and cuts it in half
the massiff flies over the cliff howling
it plummets to its death hundreds of feet below
anakin pulls up near the edge of a cliff
he gets off the bike and creeps to the edge
he looks over to see a tusken camp in the oasis below
one of the huts at the edge of the camp has two tusken guards outside it
anakin creeps through the camp working his way from hut to hut flattening himself against the wall s overhearing snatches of tusken conversation from inside using the shadows to him
him until he arrives at the hut with the two guards
they are sitting a short distance from the door
anakin wriggles around the black
he takes out his lightsaber and cuts into the base of the wall
the lightsaber completes the hole in the wall
anakin wriggles in
he pulls himself to his feet
there are candles everywhere
a shaft of moonlight from a hole in the roof pierces the gloom of the hut
by its light anakin sees shmi hanging from a wooden frame in the middle of the hut
he cuts her free takes her into his arms and lowers her gently to the ground
her eyes are closed
her face is bloodied
she has been terribly beaten
anakin cradles her tenderly
shmis eyelids flutter and barely open
they are caked with blood
is it you
shmis eyes focus slowly
anakin gives a little choking gasp
im here mom
im going to get you out of here
im so glad
to see you annie
i am complete
just stay with me mom
im going to make you well again
everythings going to be fine
you look so handsome
my grown up son
im so proud of you annie
i missed you so much
anakin draws her to his breast
there is silence for a moment
anakin lifts his head listening for a moment then he sits on the floor of the tusken hut cradling his dead mother in his arms
obi wan arrives at the head of the trail
far below a flat plain stretches into the distance
he stop peering into the darkness where strange shapes loom indistinctly
obi wan takes a pair of electronic binoculars from his belt and puts them to his eyes
he sees a cluster of great towers like fantastic stalagmites rise from the plain below
slow pan with the binoculars and suddenly a line of battle starships come into view
obi wan touches the viewfinder
between fifty and a hundred federation starships in near rows
some are on platforms that are carrying the starships diwn to an underground facility
other platforms are rising to the surface
they carry thousands of battle droids that step off and file into the waiting ships
a fully loaded starship takes off
obi wan swings the binoculars upward to see more federation starships
the pale light grows
thin tendrils of smoke rise slowly in the cold clear air
somewhere an dog barks
an old woman comes out of one of the huts
she carries a pail
she swirls it and tosses the dirty water onto the ground
as she goes back inside the hut a tusken child runs past dragging a stick in the sand
the child runs through the line of huts turns a corner and stops suddenly staring at the bodies of the two tusken guards
between them anakin stands outside the hut door
his face is a grim mask
the child stares then there is a flash of light as anakins lightsaber switches on
obi wan comes running back to his ship and climbs into the cockpit
he settles into his seat
his arfour droid beeps a happy greeting
obi wan switches on his comlink
guiding light to old folks home
a line of reflecting pools with splashing fountains flanked by statues on each side leads to the main entrance to the awesome building
a hologram of obi wan flickers in front of a group made up of jedi yoda mace windu and ki adi mundi and senators bail organa ask aak luminara and
palpatine and mas amedda are in the middle of the group watching with growing concern
starships from the trade federation and the commerce guilds are taking deliveries of battle droids from the foundries on geonosis
the treaty forbids the trade federation from building up an army
what are they doing
the droid foundry seems to be working at full capacity
i am going to go down and investigate
i will bring jango fett back home for interrogation
those geonosian foundries are part of the techno union
we will call in their representatives and ask them a few very pointed questions
one more thing
jango mentioned he was recruited by someone named darth tyranus
any idea who that might be
with the forename darth a sith he must be
our missing apprentice
they are playing their hand at last
do you believe he could be the mysterious sido dyas who made the deal for the clone army
perhaps too many pieces are missing from this puzzle there are
be careful obi wan
this investigation is becoming less than routine
do you need help
let me see if i can figure out whats going on first
the hologram of obi wan fades off
palpatine stares at the spot where the hologram was in disbelief
the commerce guilds are preparing for war
there can be no doubt of that
count dooku must have made a treaty with them
we must stop them soon before theyre fully ready
the debate is over we need that clone army now
unfortunately the debate is not over
the senate will never be able to approve the use of that army before the separatists attack
mas amedda who had been silent up until now suddenly speaks up
this is a crisis
if the senate votes the chancellor emergency powers he could approve the use of the army in a minute
please please i dont wish to have emergency powers
thats too extreme a solution
its akin to a dictatorship
we must rely on the jedi
master yoda how many are available to go to geonosis
mace windu and yoda look at one another
less or more
with all due respect for the jedi order two hundred will be no match for hundreds of thousands of battle droids
we should wait for obi wan to report back
we dont know that count dooku has made a treaty with the corporate alliance its speculation
but we must prepare for the worst
im going to propose a motion granting emergency powers to the chancellor at the next session
we must not wait
out of the question senator
you and i are too closely aligned
the issue will become partisan and debates will begin
the proposal must come from a neutral source
if only senator amidala were here
jar jar steps forward from the back of the group
my august colleagues i would be proud to propose the motion in question
this is a grave situation and im sure senator amidala and the queen of naboo would agree
thank you representative binks
then palpatine sighs deeply
if called upon i will serve
but it will be the saddest day of my life
all is quiet
beru comes out of the house
she goes to a moisture line and starts to draw water
padme fixes the last piece of covering onto threepio
padme stands back
owen is with her
they look at threepio
he isnt the golden figure we know because padme has had to use whatever stuff she could findin the garage
he is multi coloured in several textures but he is complete
how do i look
you look perfect
oh miss padme im so happy
extending his hand to shake hers oh pardon me
threepio drops his hand and bows formally
continuing thank you
he forgets formality and hugs her
padme hugs him back laughing
continuing thank you
grinning well padme i think he should be yours from now on
i know that is what my mom would want
then suddenly from outside come topside everybody
a rough hologram of obi wan is projected onto the garage by artoo
anakin padme and threepio watch the flickering image
alliance have pledged their armies to count dooku and are forming an
the hologram cuts off
anakin jumps up agitated
im going after him
i thought the first thing he said was to retransmit his message to coruscant
yeah youre right youre right
anakin padme artoo and threepio leave the homestead waving to cliegg owen and beru as they go into the desert
anakin sits down in the cockpit with padme
threepio is behind them
artoo is beside him
they are watching a hologram of mace windu
we will deal with count dooku
the most important thing for you anakin is to stay where you are
protect the senator at all costs
that is your priority
the hologram switches off
padme is looking at the readout on the ships control panel
theyll never get there in time to save him
they have to come half way across the galaxy
look geonosis is less than a parsec away
padme starts to hit buttons and flick switches
anakin puts a hand over hers stopping her
she stares at him
if hes still alive
annie are you just going to sit here and let him die
hes your friend
hes like my father but you heard master windu
he gave me strict orders to stay here
he gave you strict orders to protect me
padme pulls her hand free and flicks more switches
the engines fire
continuing and im going to save obi wan
so if you plan to protect me you will have to come along
anakin grins and takes the controls
the naboo starship rises from the bluff and zooms away
two hundred jedi knights are assembling outside the huge center of the jedi order
the jedi council are assembled as mace windu makes his plea
the longer we wait the stronger dookus armies become
we cannot wait for the senate to make up its mind about granting the chancellor emergency powers in order to be able to use that clone army
we have the authority to go now
we must go now
all of the jedi council nod their approval
agreed master windu
two hundred jedi send
enough lets hope they are
inside the great rotunda the uproar is even louder
opposing senatoes yell furiously at one another
finally the uproar dies
in the regrettable absence of senator amidala the chair recognises senior representative of naboo jar jar binks
amid the conflicting storm of cheers and boos jar jar with two gungan aides floats on his pod to the middle of the vast space
he looks at palpatine nervously
jar jar clears his throat
senators dellow felagates
jar jar blushes
the senate will accord the representative the courtesy of a hearing
jar jar grips the edge of the podium
in response to the direct threat to the republic from the confederacy of independent systems i propose that the senate gives immediate emergency powers to the supreme chancellor
jar jar looks a little sheepish
continuing who can deny these are exceptional times
exceptional times demand exceptional measures
exceptional measures demand exceptional men
we wont support a dictator
shouts of agreement
that is the sentiment every one of us agrees with
and when the shadow of war has dispersed and the bright day of liberty has dawned once again the power we now give to the supreme chancellor will be gladly
and swiftly returned
out ancient liberties will be restored to us burnished even more brightly than before
brief silence then a rolling wave of applause
jar jar beams and bows
it is with great reluctance that i have agreed to this calling
i love democracy
i love the republic
the fact that this crisis is demanding i be given absolute power to tule over you is evident
but i am mild by nature and have no desire to destroy the democratic process
the power you give me i will lay down when this crisis has abated i promise you
and all i ask in return is when my current term of office is over you allow me to reture and live out my life in peace
we shall proceed to the vote
all those in favor of granting emergency powers to the supreme chancellor signal ate at this time
the naboo starship heads toward the rings of geonosis
the naboo starship lands
anakin switches off the engines
artoo and threepio are in the navigation area of the cockpit
padme is in the co pilots seat
she gets up
hey where are you going
to find obi wan
anakin gets up and goes over to her
he grabs her arm
let go of me
im not letting you go out there
its too dangerous
its my job to protect you
i said its too dangerous
youre not going and thats final
dont you give me orders annie
im a senator of the galactic republic
you have no authority to contain me restrain me or direct me
you remember your place young man
standing up now you can come along and protect me or stay here
its up to you
padme storms out of the cockpit of the naboo starfighter
anakin stands scratching his head then follows
artoo beeps and whistles
yes it is artoo
one moment theyre generating a pleasant mutual attraction and the next waves of violent hostility
even though im programmed to understand them i doubt if i ever shall
artoo whistles a plaintive sigh
anakin and padme enter the stalagmite city
they stop looking around in wonder at the emptiness
in a low voice its empty
they start forward
as they pass the surface of the pillars seems to pulse slowly and move
high above winged creatures grow from the pillars and detach themselves
anakin and padme cross the square reaching the middle
they stop suddenly as four geonosians grabs them
anakin reaches for his lightsaber
twenty winged geonosians carrying weapons alight on the flagstones in front of them
the geonosians part and count dooku appears
he bows courteously
senator amidala ive heard so much about you
count dooku i assume
im delighted to meet you at last
we have a great deal to discuss senator
i hope you can keep your young jedi under control
dont worry hes housebroken
count dooku sits at a large conference table with padme on the far side
anakin stands behind her with four geonosians guards standing behind him
jango fett stands behind count dooku and six geonosian guards stand behind him
you are holding a jedi knight obi wan kenobi
i am formally requesting you turn him over to me now
he has been convicted of espionage senator and will be executed
in just a few hours i believe
count dooku smiles
he is an officer of the republic
you cant do that
we dont recognise the republic here senator
but if naboo were to join our alliance i could easily hear your plea for clemency
anakin grabs his lightsaber but doesnt turn it on
and if i dont join your rebellion i assume this jedi with me will also die
i dont wish to make you to join our cause against your will senator but you are a rational honest representative of your people and i assume you want to
do whats in their best interest
arent you fed up with the corruption the bureaucrats the hypocrisy of it all
be honest senator
the ideals are still alive count even if the institution is failing
you believe in the same ideals we believe in
the same ideals we are striving to make prominent
if what you say is true you should stay in the republic and help chancellor palpatine put things right
the chancellor means well mlady but he is incompetent
he has promised to cut the bureaucracy but the bureaucrats are stronger than ever no
senator the republic cannot be fixed
it is time to start over
the democratic process in the republic is a sham a shell game played on the voters
it will not be long before the cult of greed called the republic will lose even the pretext of democracy and freedom
i cannot believe that
i will not forsake all i have honoured and worked for and betray the republic
i know of your treaties with the trade federation the commerce guilds and the others count
what is happening here is not government that has been bought out by business
its business becoming government
are you willing to betray your jedi friends
without your co operation i can do nothing to stop their execution
what is to happen to me
am i to be executed also
i wouldnt think of such an offence
but there are individuals who have a strong interest in your demise mlady
it has nothing to do with politics im afraid
its purely personal and they have already paid great sums to have you assassinated
im sure they will push hard to have you included in the executions
im sorry but if you are not going to co operate i must turn you over to the geonosians for justice
ive done all i can for you
jango fett moves over to anakin
ill take that weapon
you may cause a lot of bloodshed my young jedi but you will not escape
anakin hands his lightsaber over to jango fett
anakin and padme are standing in the centre of what looks like a courtroom
seated before them in a tall boxed off area is poggle the lesser archduke of geonosis
he is accompanied by his underling sun rit
off to one side the separatist senators po nudu tessek and toonbuck toora
next to them are the commerce dignitaries shu mai nute gunray passel argente wat tambor and san hill of the intergalactic bank clan
along the wall about a hundred geonosians wait for a verdict
you have been charged and found guilty of espionage
do you have anything to say before your sentence is carried out
you are committing an act of war archduke
i hope you are prepared for the consequences
count dooku simply smiles
we build weapons senator
that is our business
of course were prepared
get on with it
carry out the sentence
i want to see her suffer
your other jedi friend is waiting for you senator
take them to the arena
four guards take hold of padme and anakin
they are escorted out of the chamber to the sounds of chuckling
in the gloomy tunnel anakin and padme are tossed into an open cart
the murmur of a vast crowd is heard offscreen
guards extend their arms along the framework and tie them so that they stand facing each other
the driver gets up onto his seat
dont be afraid
im not afraid to die
ive been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life
what are you talking about
i love you
you love me
i thought we decided not to fall in love
that we would be forced to live a lie
that it would destroy our lives
i think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway
my love for you is a puzzle annie for which i have no answers
i cant control it
and now i dont care
i truly deeply love you and before we die i want you to know
padme leans toward anakin
by straining hard it is just possible for their lips to meet
i have no desire to be cured of this love either
long or short i vow to spend the rest of my life with you
they kiss again
the driver cracks his whip over the orray harnessed between the shafts
the cart jerks forward
suddenly there isa huge roar and blinding sunlight as they emerge into the arena the great stadium is packed with tier upon tier of yelling geonosians
the cart trundles to the center where obi wan is chained to one of four upright posts thatare three feet in diameter
the cart stops
padme and anakin are taken down dragged to posts and chained to them
padme is in the center
i was beginning to wonder if you had gotten my message
i retransmitted it as you requested master
then we decided to come and rescue you
it looks like youre going a good job so far
their arms are pulled high above their heads and the cart drives away
there is another roar as poggle the lesser count dooku nute gunray the fetts and dignitaries arrive in the archducal box and take their places
the felons before you have been convicted of espionage against the sovereign system of geonosis
their sentence of death is to be carried out in this public arena henceforth
the crowd roars and cheers
in the box poggle the lesser rises
the crowd becomes quiet
let the executions begin
the crowd goes wild
i have a bad feeling about this
from different gates around the arena three monsters are driven in
one is a reek bull like one is a nexu lion like and one is an acklay a kind of dino lobster
they are driven in by picadors carrying long spears and riding orrays
the picadors poke the monsters toward the center then retire to the perimeter
the monsters toss their heads looking around roaring or screeching
then they catch sight of the three captives and start moving toward them
take the one the left
ill take the one on the right
what about padme
padme has turned around and is pulling herself up by the chain to the top of the post
within a moment she is standing on top of it trying to pull the chain free
it looks like shes already on top of things
the reek charges anakin
he jumps up and the beast hits the post hard
anakin lands onto its back wrapping part of his chain around its horn
the reek backs off shaking its head angrily which tears the chain from the post obi wan ducks around the post as the acklay charges
it knocks the post flat sending obi wan sprawling
the acklay crunches the post between its claws freeing the chain
obi wan leaps up and runs towards one of the picadors
the acklay taks off after him
the nexu arrives at padmes post and rears on its hind legs
one top padme struggles to tear the chain free
the nexu roars displaying wicked dripping fangs
in the archducal box nute gunray beams and rubs his hands
in the arena obi wan runs at the picador
the orray rears up
obi wan grabs the picadors long spear and pole vaults over him
the chasing acklay smashes into the orray
it goes down
the picador tumbles onto the sand where he is grabbed by the acklay and crunched
anakins reek starts to buck
it charges around the arena with anakin hanging on for dear life
he whirls the free length of chain around his head and casts it into the reeks mouth
its jaws clamp hard on the chain
anakin yanks hard on the chain turning the reek beginning to ride it
the nexus claws dig deep into the post
the cat like creature reaches the top of the post and takes a swipe at padme
she turns and the claw barely catches her shirt ripping it off leaving superficial claw marks across her back
she hits the creature with her chain and it backs off down the pole
then padme jumps off the post into the air
she swings around on the chain and whacks the beast hard on the head with both her feet
it tumbles back onto the sand
in the archducal box foul
she cant do that
shoot her or something
in the arena obi wan runs out from behind the fallen orray and throws the spear at the acklay hitting it in the neck
it lets out a terrible screech and turns on him
the nexu springs up and makes to leap up at padme again
she finally manages to work the chain loose
anakin comes charging up on the reek
nods gasping sure
well sort of
the nexu springs
padme leaps from the top of the post to land on the reek in front of anakin
he hauls her upright
the reek charges away around the arena
the nexu bounds after it
the reek passes the wounded acklay
the nexu smells the blood and turns aside to attack the acklay
the two monsters fight
the crowd groans and boos
in the archducal box nute gunray turns angrily to count dooku
this isnt how its supposed to be
jango finish her off
count dooku motions for the bounty hunter to ptay put
boba fett is enjoying the spectacle
smiling enigmatically patiece viceroy
she will die
maybe this is the way its supposed to end
obi wan runs and jumps on the back of the reek behind anakin
across the arena the nexu having chewed up the acklay starts to advance toward them
yes it has been rather a long time
do you suppose somethings happened to them
artoo beeps and whistles
oh no i shouldnt think so
it looks a very dull planet to me
they should be back shortly
just stop worrying artoo
in the archducal box amid the uproar count dooku feels a tap on his shoulder
he turns to see mace windu standing behind him
count dooku masks his surprise elegantly as he surveys the arena and sees jedi knights standing at every entrance and exit
master windu how pleasant of you to join us
youre just in time for the moment of truth
i would think these two new boys of yours could use a little more training
sorry to disappoint you dooku
this partys over
mace windu signals and at stategic places around the arena there are sudden flashes of light as about one hundred jedi switch on their lightsabers
the crowd is suddenly silent
count dookus lips curl in slight amusement
to mace windu brave but stupid my old jedi friend
youre impossibly outnumbered
i dont think so
one jedi has to be worth a hundred geonosians
count dooku looks around the great theater
his smile grows
it wasnt the geonosians i was thinking about
how well do you think one jedi will hold up against a thousand battle droids
count dooku signals
thousands of droids start to pour into all parts of the arena
mace windu draws his lightsaber jango fett draws his guns and fires at mace windu who deflects the shots
jango fett and mace windu jump into the arena where they fight
boba fett wacthes his dad and the jedi master fight
the battle beginss
geonosians fly away everywhere
droids fire at jedi who deflect the bolts and cult down the droids
the geonosian troops fire ray guns that are more difficult for the jedi to deflect
the reek and the nexu are spooked by the battle
the reek bucks the riders off its back and stampedes around the arena trampling droids and jedi that have moved into its path
padme picks up a discarded pistol and joins the fight
several jedi run to the center of the arena and toss lightsabers to obi wan and anakin
among the crowd jedi cut down swaths of geonosians and droids
on the sand jedi fight attacking droids
obi wan and anakin swing their lightsabers cutting droids in half
padme blasts away at droids and geonosians
i dont hear anything
artoo beeps youre scaring me
stop imagining things
among the tiers jedi are slowly being driven back
they have killed heaps of geonosians and have kncoked out piles of droids but sheer numbers are telling
individual jedi are being cut down or blasted the rest are retreating into the arena
anakin and padme are back to back fighting droids and flying geonosians
mace windu fights fiercely with jango fett
finally the bounty hunter falls
his helmet goes flying bouncing down the steps tumbling and rolling kicked here and there by random feet
the bounty hunters body falls to the ground
mace windu runs to the center of the arena and fights back to back with obi wan as they swipe and mangle droids
someones got to shut down these droids
its being taken care of
ki adi mundi leads a raiding party of about twenty jedi through the lines of parked battle starships
they cut a swath through masses of droids until they arrive at the command starship
some jedi fall
the rest cut their way up the ramps and into the command ship
ki adi mundi and teh surviving jedi fight their way through the corridors of the command ship deflecting laser bolts slicing droids
they burst onto the bridge and chop down the command droids
the neimoidians flee in all directions
ke adi mundi leans over the control panel
he locates the illuminated master switch and punches down on it
it goes dark
instantly all the droids on the starship and all the droids in the arena freeze
there is a moment of stunned silence then the jedi cheer
one the bridge plo koon claps ki adi mundi on the back
weve done it
now we have a chance
suddenly there is a harsh beeping sound
all the droids on the starship and all the droids in the arena start fighting again
ki adi mundi stares in disbelief and dismay
the systems off but theyre still active
thats a new feature
they are independent of the control system
mace windu obi wan anakin padme and an exhausted group of about twenty jedi stand in the center of the arena surrounded by a ring of battle droids
the bloodied sand around them is strewn with the bodies of dead geonosians shattered droids and jedi
at the foot of some steps boba fett finds his fathers battered helmet
he picks it up
ki adi mundi and the survivors from the raiding party are herded into the arena by superdroids
from the encircling tiers above thousands of battle droids level their weapons menacingly
in the archducal box count dooku lifts his hand
the droids lower their weapons
the count calls out to the jedi
continuing you have fought gallantly
worthy of recognition in the history archives of the jedi order
now it is finished
pauses briefly surrender and your lives will be spared
we will not be hostages for you to barter with dooku
then im sorry old friend
you will have to be destroyed
the droids raise their weapons
anakin and padme clasps hands tightly
count dooku raises his hand to give the order to fire
padme looks up suddenlt and whispers to anakin
above six gunships are descending fast through the open area in the arena ceiling
they land in a cluster around the handful of jedi
clone troopers spill out and start firing at the droids
there is a hellstorm of laserfire that bounces off the laser shields created by the gunships
yoda appears at the door of one of the gunships
come on hurry
the surviving jedi dash to the gunships and scramble in
mace windu hangs on tight as the gunship firing all its weapons rises out of the arena up and over the topmost rim
the massed lines of parked federation starships and the droids surrounding the arena are themselves surrounded by thousands of republic starships disgorging tens of thousands of clone troopers
beyond more republic starships are landing and spewing out troops
mace windu stares at the incredible sight
more battalions to the left
encircle them we must then divide
the clone troopers open fire with artillery
explosions wreck the parked battle starships
clone troopers advance firing at the massed droids
fighter droids fly overhead exchanging fire with the gunships and jedi fighters
threepio and artoo see flashes outside of the ship exploding everywhere
im sure i heard something this time
its probably just a celebration artoo lets out an exhausted bleep
gunship skims the battlefield firing down deflecting answering fire from the droids
obi wan anakin and padme are at the open sides of the gunship
clones fire down at the droids below
the gunship slows circling over a droid gun emplacement
it blasts it but suddenly the gunship is rocked by a near miss
it lurches violently
look over there
through the other side of the gunship they see a geonosian speeder racing past
in the open cockpit is the unmistakable figure of count dooku
its dooku go after him
the pilot starts to comply but
there is a huge blasts the ship lurches on its side and padme tumbles out
anakin stares down in horror as padme hits thr ground below
continuing to pilot put the ship down
we have to go after dooku
no were not
land this ship
dont let your personal feelings get in the way
weve got a job to do
below padme hauls herself to her feet and waves for them to go after dooku
i dont care
shes all right
anakin stares out to see padme rescued by clone troopers
continuing follow that speeder
on the ground padme looks up at gunship as it speeds away after count dooku
obi wan and anakin follow the speeder to a geonosian tower
the speeder decsends rapidly the gunship follows
count dookus speeder parks outside the tower the gunship parks next to it
obi wan and anakin leap down and run inside the tower
count dooku throws switches on a control panel
his interstellar sail ship is guarded by a squad of super battle droids
the doors of the exit port slide open
count dooku turns as obi wan and anakin run in through the hanger doors
they draw their lightsabers
the droids raise their weapons
that wont be necessary captain
and leave them to me
the droids lower their weapons and back off to the walls
count dooku looks at obi wan and anakin with slight amusement
to anakin we move in together you slowly on the
im taking him now
youll pay for all the jedi youve killed today dooku
anakin charges across the open space at count dooku who smiles faintly watching him come
anakin raises his lightsaber
at the last moment count dooku thrusts out an arm and anakin is lifted up hurled across the room and slammed into the opposite wall
he slumps to the foot of the wall semi conscious
count dooku moves toward obi wan kenobi isnt it
as you can see my jedi powers are far beyond yours
now back down
i dont think so
obi wan lifts his lightsaber
count dooku smiles
ah but if i must
count dooku draws his lightsaber
he and obi wan start to circle each other
continuing i have spent the last ten years learning to use the power of the dark side
it gives me infinitely greater power
you will have to prove it
obi wan comes in fast swinging at count dookus head
dooku parries the cut easily
as they fight it quickly becomes clear that dooku is the complete swordsman elegant graceful classical a master of the old style
grand master kenobi you disappoint me
yoda holds you in such high esteem
count dooku parried another cut
continuing surely you can do better
parries no im surprised
has jedi swordsmanship degenerated so quickly or are you trying to make fun of me
cuts which is it
count dooku thrusts
obi wan steps back quickly panting for breath
continuing come come master kenobi
put me out of my misery
obi wan takes a deep breath gets a fresh grip on his lightsaber and comes in again
for a moment he drives count dooku back
then dookus superior skill begins to tell again and he forces obi wan to retreat
count dooku increases the tempo of his attack
obi wan is pushed to the limit to defend himself
his lightsaber flashes
obi wan is wounded in the shoulder then the thigh
he stumbles back against the wall trips and falls
his lightsaber goes skittering across the floor
count dooku raises his lightsaber
obi wan looks up helplessly
dookus lightsaber flashes down and clashes against anakins lightsaber
count dooku and anakin stare eyeball to eyeball
continuing thats brave of you boy but foolish
i would have thought youd have learnt your lesson
im a slow learner
and anakin charges at count dooku
the force of his attack catches the count slightly off balance
anakins lightsaber flashes
count dooku draws back putting a hand to his arm
he takes the hand away and looks at the smear of blood whee anakin has nicked him
you have unusual powers young padawan
but not enought to save you this time
dont bet on it
obi wan uses the force to catch his lightsaber and he tosses it to anakin
with two lightsabers anakin attacks
count dooku parries and ripostes
it is no contest
anakin is driven back against the wall
he loses one lightsaber
finally count dooku in one flashing move sends anakins arm cut at the elbow flying still gripping his lightsaber
anakin drops to the ground in agony
count dooku draws himself up to deliver the coup de grace
suddenly the great doors slide open
the droids turn fast raising their weapons
through the thick smoke emerges the heroic figure of yoda
he stops on the smoke filled threashold four droids lined up on either side of him guns pointed
before the droids can get off a shot yoda raises his hand and the droids are flung against the far walls and crash to the floor in heaps of smoking
count dooku steps away from anakin to face the jedi grand master
his lightsaber whirls in a formal salute
at last we shall know who is the most powerful
yoda draws a miniature lightsaber out of his cane
he salutes formally
no interest in contests do i have
count dooku charges across the space at yoda
he rains down blows upon the tiny figure
yoda doesnt budge an inch
for the first part of the contest he parries every cut and thrust that dooku aims
nothing the great swordsman tries gets through
his energy drains
his strokes become feebler slower
he flies forward
count dooku is forced to retreat
wprds are insufficient to describe the range and skill of yodas speed and swordplay
his lightsaber his a humming blur of light
count dookus lightsaber is sent cartwheeling from his hand
he staggers back gasping and spent against the control panel
yoda jumps onto dookus shoulders and is about to drive the lightsaber into the top of the counts head
continuing the end for you count this is
count dooku raises his arms and knocks yoda off his shoulders and then with all his might he uses the force to pull on one of the cranes in the
it comes crashing down on obi wan and anakin
but in the blink of and eye yoda is under the crane holding it up using the force
yoda closes his eyes and concentrates
anakin is unconscious and obi wan tries toget out from under the crane
the fallen crane trembles and starts to life
behind it the sound of the sail ships engines are heard starting up
yoda concentrates harder
slowly the crane rises
the sound of the engines increases
yoda exerts every scrap of his powers
the crane lifts clear of anakin and is thrown to the ground
dookus sail ship takes off
obi wan and anakin struggle to the exhausted yoda but its too late
the sail ship rises into the air and flies away
padme and a clone captain with about ten troopers appear in the doorway
padme runs too him and throws her arms around him
anakin is barely able to stand up
the clone captain marches up to yoda stops and salutes smartly
resistance is at an end general
what are your orders
yoda looks at him and sighs
count dookus interstellar sail ship glides through a deserted burned out part of coruscant
count dooku manoeuvres the ship into one of the empty buildings and lands
the ramp lowers
count dooku emerges and walks to where the hooded figure of darth sidious stands waiting
count dooku bows
the force is with us my master
welcome home lord tyranus
you have done well
i bring you good news my lord
the war has begun
smiling everything is going as planned
the beautiful temple basks in the red glow of the setting sun
where is your apprentice
on his way back to naboo
he is escorting senator amidala home
they are standing looking out through the tall windows at the great plaza below
yoda sits in his chair
continuing i must admit without the clones it would not have been a victory
victory you say
obi wan turns and looks at the sad little jedi sitting in the council chamber
apart from ki adi mundi and plo koon who is wounded the chamber is empty
continuing not victory a defeat it was
master obi wan
begun the clone war has
in a rose covered arbor overlooking the sparkling late anakin and padme stand before a naboo holy man
threepio and artoo stand by watching as the holy man blesses the happy couple and amid gently falling rose petals anakin and padme kiss
palpatine jar jar bail organa and the other senators with two royal guards stand looking down at the square below
tens of thousands of clone troops are drawn up in a strict formation or move forwards in near files to climb the ramps of the military assault ships
on the balcony palpatines expression is deeply sad
everyone watches comberly as in the square loaded assault ships take off
other land immediately in their place
the sky above is thick with transports
clone troops march and board the ships
the great clone war has begun
