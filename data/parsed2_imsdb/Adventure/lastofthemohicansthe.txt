written by michael mann christopher crowe the screen is a microcosm of leaf crystal drops of precipitation a stone emerald green moss
its a landscape in miniature
we hear the forest
some distant birds
their sound seems to reverberate as if in a cavern
a piece of sunlight refracts within the drops of water paints a patch of moss yellow
the whisper of wind is joined by another sound that mixes with it
a distant rustling
it gets closer and louder
its shallow breathing
it gets ominous
were interlopers on the floor of the forest and something is coming
rockets through the frame scaring us and
his head shaved bald except for a scalp lock
hes twenty five
he seems tall and muscled
heavy even breathing
well learn later this man is uncas the last of the mohicans
flash as he runs
one carries a flintlock musket
sweat on the mans skin
a calico shirt is gathered at the waist with a wampum belt of small white beads over a breechcloth
he wears leggings to protect his legs
a long handled tomahawk is stuffed in his belt
in the hand of another running man
hes heavier older
a green bear claw is tattooed there
a snake is tattooed over his left eyebrow
silver rings in his ear
hes forty to forty five
his head is shaved into a scalp lock
it says come and lift this from me
take it if you can
that prospect strikes us as extremely unlikely
this man is the french call him le gros serpent the great snake because he knows the winding ways of mens nature and he can strike a sudden deathly blow
runs disturbing no leaves no branches making no sound
hes running parallel to uncas through the cathedral of mature forest
its heavily canopied
theres very little brush
the girth of the trees is huge
shafts of light illuminate motes of dust and turn leaves emerald where the sun breaks through
sometimes theres ferns rhododendron sometimes pale grass and outcroppings of rock
these men run the forest streams over boulders fallen trees and down into ravines as if they own them
rocketing through trees
his torn buckskin shirt is tied at the waist with a wampum belt holding a tomahawk and a large knife
a long rifle in which is carved the name killdeer is in his right fist
indian tattooing on his chest
his name is nathaniel poe
hes a few years older than uncas
the french and the french speaking tribes know him as la longue carabine long rifle
other frontiersmen in new york colony and the iroquois and delaware speaking tribes know him as hawkeye
sweat stains his shirt
he flashes through the tree branches disturbing nothing
making no sound
two hundred and fifty yards away a few square inches buried in the foliage
killdeers at his shoulder
cocks the lock holding the piece of flint click
stops dead holding out his hand
slips through young trees and stops shouldering his smoothbore musket
is this an ambush
five feet and fourteen pounds of rifle is elevated a half inch and shifted left off target
its a precise smooth movement
no human quiver
holding the flint hits the iron file of the frizzen shooting sparks into the pan of priming powder which flashes and
is a huge elk that leaps at the sound
cracks like lightning
leaps where the
caliber round was programmed to intercept him
on the moment of impact
three men approach the fallen elk and each other
we realize theyre hunting together
hawkeye steps aside for chingachgook
his massive war club is flat and angles to one side with a stabbing blade
hawkeye is stepson and stepbrother
the two younger men treat chingachgook with an easy deference and affection
hawkeyes a dialectic of two cultures
in his coloration and worldliness hes more the anglo saxon frontiersman
in his independent views and candid manner and in his combat skills and woodsmanship hes more native american mohican
as chingachgook takes out his long knife and they approach the fallen elk
low mohican sub titled were sorry to kill you brother
i do honor to your courage and speed your strength
roasts potatoes on a stick in the stone fireplace next to captain jack winthrop an american in very worn quasi military gear
on a rough table in the tiny cabin alexandria his wife is kneading bread
three children climb on their father
he grabs their wild seven year old son james who shrieks laughter and dodges away
the cabin has two primitive rooms waxed paper windows log walls
a dog barks
others pick it up
cameron jack are suddenly alert reaching for weapons
appears warily musket in hand
doorway cameron towards the interior
set three more places
to the fence how is chingachgook then
behind him emerging from the dark trees are hawkeye uncas cradling flint locks blankets and packs over their shoulders leading a mule laden with skins and the elk carcass
crossing the splitrail fence
the master of life is good
another year pass
how is it with you john
yes it is
cleared another quarter i see
shakes hands with uncas yes i did
tears past his father runs full bore
just before hes going to collide into uncas he leaps into the air and uncas snatches him with one hand and swings him up onto his shoulders
the kid screams with delight and rides back towards the cabin that way
alexandria comes to the door
lights smokes a clay pipe
the scene says this is a rustic frontier home and these people have known each other live in dangerous circumstances
if uncas is with you that means he has not found a woman and started a family yet
your eyes are too sharp alexandria cameron
they see into my heart
your farm good to you this year john
it was a good year for corn
mohawk field we saw was mile long on the river
chief joseph brandts field
you take much fur
that we did
but the horicane sic is near trapped out
tradin your skins in castleton
with the dutch for silver
french english want to buy with wampum brandy
so what is it jack
what brings you up here
a french indian army out of fort carillons heading south to war against the english
im here to raise this countys militia to aid the british defense
folks here goin to join in that fight
well see in the morning
fathers of england france both take more land furs than they need
theyre cold full of greed
fewd deny that
where you headin
trap over the fall and winter among the delawares in can tuck ee
so i can find a woman and make mohican children so our father will leave my brother me in peace
so do hawkeye chingachgook
a son like me
uncas grabs james suspends him upside down
you are too strong
turn me old too fast
hawkeye grabs the kid from uncas
the kids laughing cant stay still
chingachgook watches content smoking his clay pipe
thats what hes doin to his mama
she ruffles his hair and lifts the heavy iron pot off the tibbet
uncas goes to help her she shrugs his hand away and carries it to the table herself
the men gather around
theres pan baked bread a dish of salt and the pot has venison and yellow cornmeal in a kind of stew
dear father thank you for rewardin the fruits of our labor with plenty
as they start to eat
slam into other kids as they battle through a lacrosse game
in the background are sixty men women and children
its a community gathering held out of doors
weve entered mid scene
captain jack is standing on a box
some women and kids mill around some tables and boards laid over barrels
most but not all around captain jack are men nine settlers hunter trappers eight mohawk farmers in mixed european and native clothing
off to the side are an english lieutenant on horseback and a ten man escort from whatever regiments in albany
a man named henri speaks in french
his son martin translates
in french translates my father says he was driven out of france by the black robe priests and he would fight them now but he lost his arm and so
i will go in his place
is an unusually large mohawk in a blue match coat with a little girl holding his hand
he says something to chingachgook who nods
hawkeye and uncas are a little apart in an outer grouping of the men
ongewasgone is a war chief and wears a white plume and is tattooed
as martin finishes he steps forward
john cameron thank you for your hospitality
twin river mohawk got no quarrel with les francais
trade furs with les francais
now les francais bring huron onto mohawk hunting grounds
these people are english scots irish and dutch farmers some french huguenot mechanics craftsmen
theyre in shirt sleeves and indian moccasins leggings
the mohawks vast lands and corn agriculture border the settlement
they ve been acculturated for over a hundred years
some wear european calico hunting shirts
their heads are shaved to scalping locks and many are tattooed
theyve politically and commercially played france england against each other very adroitly for over a hundred years because of their military power and geographic position
their relations with working farmers and settlers and their families has been mostly one of co existence because theres always been more than enough for all
this is a wpa mural of ethnic diversity and plurality of frontier america
the europeans are former indentured laborers farmers exiled by economics or religious persecution frontier hunters and trappers
continues now mohawk will fight huron and les francais
my brothers have asked me to lead them in this war so i speak for the twin river council
the importance of this commitment is apparent to the lieutenant
his majesty king george ii is very grateful for your support
how far up the valley
to fort william henry
two days from here
some dont like this
it should be enough to remind you france is the enemy
heads turn to hawkeye at the periphery of the crowd
what did you say
loud i said
france is your enemy
do you want them to overrun all new york colony
first place you started it with the french over fur trapping claims to the head waters of the ohio
smiles now youre sayin these people have a fight on their hands
ignoring hawkeye will you men help us stop the french
and while they are cooped up in your fort what if the french send war parties to raid their homes
what then lieutenant
for your own homes for king for country thats why you men ought to join this fight
you do what you want with your own scalp
do not be tellin us what to do with ours
furious to hawkeye you sir
you call yourself a loyal subject
do not call myself much of a subject at all
but if i got to fight figure ill try and do it fifty miles north of here instead of my bean field
i am stayin on my farm
and any man who goes his family is welcome to fort up with us til he comes back
my sense of it is enough of us will join up to fill the countys levy
but only if general webb accepts a few terms i got in mind
cross through the people
a few men drift off to their women at the tables
it is apparent two thirds of the men will join
a couple of jokes light banter no hostility
whats that jack
as they cross through they start removing their shirts and weapons
you boys marchin with us
what do you say
we had our say ian
they approach the lacrosse field
chingachgook stands with cameron in the background watching
uncas joins james
hawkeye goes on the other side
a couple of young mohawks and a young blonde farmer shout hallos and as the bodies crash into each other
nd regiment of foot day in two rows
at each command the crack troops respond en masse
their hands slap the stocks of their brown bess muskets in unison
these men are drilling in preparation for war
we witness a state of the art th century precision killing machine
shouts shoulder arms
slam order arms
men bite the paper prime
powder dropped in pan load
muskets at chest height pre sent
muskets shouldered make ready
muskets returned to chests pre sent
muskets returned to shoulder fire
like a single shot two hundred fifty black powder muskets fire
caliber lead shot at chest height in a scythe of death
the dutch roof lines of albany are in the distance
nearer a coach races past
six horses wide with dumb mute strain
foam manes fly their hooves pound the yellow road into dust
military outriders are on the three left side horses
sits erectly in the brilliant scarlet coat of the first royal regiment of foot with gold braid blue black facing and blue black breeches cavalry boots spurs a tricorn white
and a gorget large medallion around his neck
hes and tough
he is self sure principled reactionary
he believes human society is static layered into hierarchies of class and they are absolutely impermeable
he opens a simple gold clasped case contemplates its contents
an enameled portrait of a dark haired young woman
as a soldier is militarily first rate in his milieu the open battlefields of europe
right now however he is about to enter the forests of north america
he closes his clasp and glances out the window as we enter albany and as a facade of buildings people pass
four grenadiers come to attention as heyward enters mid scene
if they are not allowed leave to defend their families if the french or hurons attack the settlements no colonial militia is goin to fort william henry
low you there
help my man outside with the baggage
general jerome webb sees heyward and nods
three of webbs adjutants are on either side
three remaining grenadiers in bearskin covered mitred caps are at the door
facing webb are a half dozen colonial representatives including captain jack winthrop
heyward watches jack
they will report or be pressed into service
any of the boys worth havin can disappear into forest
time it takes you to blink
wheres that leave ya then
heyward preparing to hand over dispatches is interrupted by the insubordinate tone
equally wound tightly is the lieutenant
they will be found
cuts in i cannot imagine his majesty in his benevolence would ever object to his american subjects defending their hearth home their women children if threatened by the scourge of
attack from savages aroused to such excess by our enemy the ever perfidious french
does that mean they will be granted leave to defend their homes if the settlements are attacked
heywards more amazed by what hes just heard from webb
these americans including jack are streaming past him on their way out
you got yourself a colonial militia general
major duncan heyward reporting sir
webbs pouring gin
how was your journey
the door closes
dispatches are passed
they are now alone except for the generals two adjutants and a shadowy form waiting patiently in a corner
in the dim light hes motionless
webb slides a glass across to heyward
i didnt experience anything so surprising from bristol to albany as what i witnessed here today
and what is that
the crown negotiating the terms of service
assuming a co commiserator one has to give americans reasons and make agreements to get them to do anything at all
tiring isnt it
throws up his hands but thats the way of it here
tight i thought british policy is make the world
majors dont upbraid generals
you will take command of the nd regiment of foot
at fort william henry under colonel munro
i will march the rd to fort edward
might i enquire if general webb has heard from colonel munros daughters
i was to rendezvous with them in albany and escort them to the fort
to magua after a glance at heyward you there
what does munro call you
to heyward the scotsman has sent one of his indian allies to guide you
rises and slowly walks into the light
he is reserved and over six feet tall
his head is shaved into a mohawk
rings beads feathers pierce his ears
a blanket is worn as a shawl over his left shoulder exposing his right arm and heavy tattooing
a long tomahawk is in the belt of his breechcloth
the scotsmans daughters are at the poltroons house
a company of the rd will accompany you and magua will show you the way
by your leave sir
webb holds heyward a moment to adjutants explain to the major we care little about toying with colonial militia because we have little to fear from the french
they have not the nature for war
their latinate voluptuousness combines with their gallic laziness and the result is they would rather make love with their faces than fight
webbs adjutants laugh uproariously at his wit
heywards stiff perfunctory smile
hes been made the butt of the joke
he does not share webbs derisive view of the french
webb doesnt like heywards manner
we dont like webb
then continuing dismissed
heyward stiffly salutes
webb casually perfunctorily salutes the younger man in return
to magua dawn
at the encampment
see to it youre there
beneath maguas barely deferential manner we sense intelligence menace
none of these brits see it
brushed clean his wig freshly powdered his tricorn in his hand with a crimson sash and sword and his cavalry boots walks through the gate after knocking
he enters a small courtyard
suddenly he hears
heyward looks to the side
an inner light turns on
in this mode this is a man we could like
enters from the garden
shes vivacious dark haired unconventional in that shes educated but with conventional values and attitudes
she hugs duncan to her and then pushes him away to look at him
my god its good to see you
he takes her hand in both of his and kisses it
he is open and lit up
a vegetable plot behind the poltroons house is a provincial substitute for a formal garden setting
heyward and cora sit on rough wooden chairs
in the background a servant hangs laundry
the white sheets billow
a table holds a tea setting
theyre sitting close to each other talking seriously and quietly
duncans jacket is removed
then im embarrassed to be so indecisive
after so long apart and after youve traveled so far
and by sea
you still have an aversion to the water
but it was worth it all to end in a garden by your side
she looks askance at him
then the banter drops
difficult dear duncan my affection is as towards a closest friend
alice and i depend on you and respect you immensely
i wish they did but my feelings dont go beyond that
do you see
isnt respect and friendship a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined
and all else may grow in time
some say thats the way of it
cousin eugenie my father but
interrupts cora in my heart i know once were joined well be the happiest couple in england
let those whom you trust your father help settle whats best for you
in view of your indecision why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine
cora stares directly at heyward
then she looks away
she has no answer
something subterranean disturbs her about delegating judgment over the fate of her life
will you consider that
pause smiles yes
yes i will
shes still unsettled
eighteen years old white blonde hair wide blue eyes
shes effervescent and runs to hug him
heyward is taken aback by her enthusiasm and laughs
my god youve grown up
we leave in the morning
rises yes miss
i wont sleep tonight
what an adventure
i absolutely cannot wait to return to portman square having laid eyes upon the full blooded red men in the wild
my god alice
smiles it can be dangerous
papa wouldnt have sent for us if it were dangerous
alice takes hewywards hand
cora pours heyward more tea
the white sheets billow
barks atten shun
jolt upright as if electrified
entering shoulder arms
a sergeant major of forty one is wide and deep and built like a fullback
you do not mess with sgt
barks form two companies of nine
march in perfect drill into two groups each three across and three deep
climbs onto his white military charger
cora alice are in riding dresses and veils
the veil doesnt completely cover alices golden hair and blue eyes and the flush of her complexion
theyre riding two sidesaddled narragansetts
the tight traveling dress reveals that cora two or three years older than alice is fuller and more mature
all three ride to the front of the column
the baggage horses and mule are in the gap between the two companies
cradling his musket
down the path that leads into the wall of forest looks impressive
now they look brave but smaller
the forest with all its mysteries and dangers now impresses us as a towering dark sinister and its immensity swallows up the living mass which slowly enters its bosom
tracking the redcoats their faces now filmed with dust cut with lines of perspiration
they march in perfect formation
we track past the pack horses the first company sgt
major ambrose and on to cora alice
alice seems fatigued
coras turned looking up into the forest canopy astonished at the deep beauty of the place
of trees is dark except for spots where leaves are sparse and there the light is golden
its the forest of childhood
in a ravine a buck disappears into a deeper stand of trees
alice did you see that
reveries broken by heyward entering the frame
alice rouses from fatigue
are you alright
can we rest soon
heyward rides to the front of the column to magua whos twenty to thirty yards ahead of everybody else
you there scout
magua slowly turns towards heyward
overly articulated we must
perfect english i understand
this is not good place to stop
two leagues from here
no water til then
that where we stop
stop in the glade just ahead
when the ladies are rested we will proceed
do you understand
in huron english subtitle magua understand paleface is a dog to his women
when his women want to eat he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness
what did you say
magua say yes
as they begin to stop
silently entering on either side of us come chingachgook followed by hawkeye and uncas
even relaxed they carry themselves with a degree of alertness
theyre eighteenth century viet cong moving through the rain forest
the maxfield parrish hudson valley of tall trees ravines and streams is idyllic in front of them
all three cradle their long guns and move silently on moccasined feet
in a stream relaxed but attentive abruptly stops
the others freeze in their tracks
chingachgook sees and then stoops to examine
under the water in the stream
its been turned from its bed
chingachgook finds another
uncas moving up on his flank climbs the bank and moves off into the trees searches and then he gestures
hes found another sign of something
has headed off further down the stream and discovers nothing
rapidly he rejoins uncas and hawkeye whove become extremely alert
they move up the bank into the forest ninety degrees from their previous path
they hardly disturb a blade of grass
the impression expertise deadliness and an impression somethings wrong
the trail cuts the side of a hill
the ground on one side rises into a forest acclivity and on the other falls off into a forested ravine
magua walking towards camera
slid his tomahawk out from the front of his belt that girdles his waist
he lets the shaft drop into his hand
he shrugs off his blanket
there is a solidity to his dark tall figure we didnt see before
magua turns about face and advances on the column
track with magua
heyward and the munro girls pass the camera as does sgt
major ambrose marching in advance of the men
magua is approaching the soldier on the left in the first row
we see magua has caught the redcoats eye
is curious starts to smile
what does the huron want to say to him
when magua is two steps away he caves in the side of the infantrymans head at the temple with the spike end of his tomahawk and backhanded hacks the blade
through the side of the neck of the center man in the first row
thirteen muskets explode from the wooded rise
are blown off the path two others are wounded
cora grabs alices reins and her own
pulling his fusil short musket seeing firing reaching for the women
bolting dodging sideways spilling alice to the earth
company make ready
the regulars slam into a firing line stepping over the bodies of their comrades
all thirteen face the incline
flash downhill through the trees
partnered in two man teams one loads and prepares and fires while the other advances to the next cover
he then prepares and fires covering his partners advance
leaping fallen trees and boulders theyre athletic fast and rapidly closing
even though the disciplined english regulars are a killing machine we now see their tactics in the dense forest are grossly inferior to the hurons
covers alice with her body holding the reins of their bolting horses
from horseback aims his horse pistol fires
leaping at him past alice cora drops
with baggage crashes off down the ravine
another two redcoats drop
a musket volley as eight muskets go off as one shot sending a lead scythe through leaves
hurons were behind cover
only one was exposed and hit
the english rush to complete the reload
will they do it in time
suddenly hurons en masse crash down onto the redcoats line with tomahawks war clubs and point blank musket fire
on the ground screaming insanely covered by cora whos protecting her little sister and
horse shot from beneath him the animal folding falling straight to the earth and
shoots ambrose in the chest and
by the munro daughters spins swinging his fusil like a ball bat upending one huron and lunges with his bayonet in his left towards another
but this huron easily slips the thrust and slams heyward with his rifle butt
dead and dying
blood gushing from his chest wound fires his pistol dropping a huron slashes a second with his sword
then hes chopped down
hurons begin scalping the british while four race towards heyward and the two women
ready to die
heyward has only his fusil as a bludgeon
blow three of the hurons sideways head over heels down the rise
barely seen running diagonally across the fall line of the ravine
in parts we recognize nathaniel recharging killdeer on full run and uncas
not sure where the shots came from
suddenly chingachgook slams him head first into the ravine with the war club
he didnt even slow down
uncas tomahawks his shoulder
the huron swings downwards
uncas ducks beneath the swing and slashes his throat sending him downhill into camera as
momentum and thrown tomahawk spread eagles one huron near a couple of wounded redcoats who fight on
calmly sees the odds have changed
his attention becomes focused
he commits a very revealing act seen through the blurred foreground action of struggling bodies
we will remember it
he raises his musket and aims at
whos unaware shes a target
why is he singling out a munro girl to kill
killdeers at his shoulder
moving through liquid his eyes drift left
the moment is frozen
their eyes lock each to the others
magua swings at hawkeye and fires
caliber musket ball rockets past his ear and hes already squeezing killdeers trigger as
from maguas musket blast clears
he almost shape shifted it happened so quickly
its nearly mystical
lowers killdeer impressed
glances back at hawkeye
she doesnt know why hes looking at her
pursues two fleeing hurons up the incline
two strides gain him the first man who he hamstrings and runs over to pursue the second up the hill
in the confused melee grabs a found musket and aims it at an indian
we recognize that hes aiming at chingachgook pursuing the second huron up the hill
duncan ignores her
is jerked from his hands
case your aim is any bettern your judgment
hes drawn his sword reflexively
hawkeye flips the musket around one handed
its pointed at heywards chest
and hawkeye fires killing an attacking huron behind heyward
as heyward spins
flashes up the hill
it cleaves the second mans back and bowls him over
chingachgook retrieves his club as his scalping knife slashes down
scalps the man he killed
chingachgook dispatches the huron he hamstrung
the women are frozen as terrified of the savages and apparent half breed rescuers as they were of those who attacked them
cora holding her is stunned but functioning
moments ago both women were clean and demure
now their riding dresses are torn mud stained blood spattered and their baggage is gone
crossed to his slaughtered soldiers
moments ago they were a testament to british military power
now theyre dead meat
ambroses body is against a tree
in the b
two of the wounded start to rise
just cut the throat of the second narraganset
it drops into the brush
alice attacks him
we need them to get out of here
uncas gently restrains her
cora reaches alice and grabs her away from the savage
heyward runs in to protect the women
to nathaniel why the bloody hell he do that to the horses
uncas all business is now reloading lifting powder horns scanning the trees
matter of fact too easy to track
they can be heard for miles
find yourself a musket
coras surprised by uncas easy english
hawkeyes scanning the forest
to heyward your wounded should try walkin back to albany
theyll never make a passage north
breathless we were headed
appropriating a knife fort william henry
to hawkeye lets go
then a fast exchange of delaware
coras surprised to see its chingachgooks decision
chingachgook looks at the survivors gives his assent starts off
take you as far as the fort
hawkeye throws heyward a musket
cora alice look towards heyward
he looks at them the women are totally terrified and do not move
if we are goin to take you we need to move
and the fort is well off our course
so if you all rather wait for the next huron war party to come by well be on our way
heyward quickly decides to go
the women follow
hawkeye starts off after uncas and chingachgook
moves through the trackless forest
uncas is far out on the left flank
cora alice duncan heyward follow in hawkeyes and chingachgooks steps
walking through a creek stepping in the stream bed instead of on stones
the others follow
hawkeye looks at heyward
hes ill at ease not being in command following the lead of some half indian frontiersman through a foreign wilderness
how far is it scout
day and a half pause where did you get
colonel munro sent him
he was one of our mohawk allies
he is huron and nothing else
checking the munro girls are not too close why would he want to murder the girl
miss cora munro
he never set eyes on her before today
no blood vengeance
no re proach or insult
of course not
pause and how is it you were nearby
came across the war party tracked em
then youre assigned to fort william henry
fort edward then
to can tuck ee
i thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia
off to the side uncas smiles at the idea
i aint your scout
and i am in no damn militia
stops then you are one of those who would allow england to fight alone while she protects you from france
england does not protect me and does not war against france on our account
she uses us to war against france on her own account
of greed for land and furs
turns clear it up any
loud i owe you gratitude or id call you out
low do not let gratitude get in the way
coras hand holds back heywards sword arm because suddenly chingachgook looms over him
to hawkeye yengeese no good in woods
make more noise i kill him
hawkeye coolly watches cora
her attitude is hostile aligned with heyward
he turns away
something in the air bothers him
hawkeye smells it too
is already moving out front low and fast
after we hold we realize chingachgooks been there all along
hawkeye and uncas join him where the branches meet the ground
smoke drifts through the trees
hawkeye sees and dips his head then looks again
burned smoldering having fallen in on itself
track left past what was the doorway
a dead childs hand protruding from the ruin
a fragment of a dress
charred and smoldering wood
john camerons body in the wreckage
and then through the collapsed posts and timbers hawkeye chingachgook and uncas have advanced and are seeing what weve just seen and then cora and alice
approaches and is frozen in horror
cora shields her from the sight
cora is affected but confronts it directly
anything to be done
returns from under one part of the wreckage ashen stoic as they all are
we know the degree of their inner pain
bends over a moccasin print that chingachgooks examining
they look at each other grimly
heyward joins them
who were these people
re print ottawa
to hawkeye ottawa
enters very careful where he places his feet
hawkeye gestures to heyward to stay where he is on the periphery with the women
to chingachgook movin fast not able to carry much
this was a war party
chingachgook nods confirmation and indicates a direction in mohican
the significance is very ominous to them
we dont know why yet
chingachgook starts away
let us look after them
he starts approaching the bodies
hawkeye and uncas follow chingachgook leaving the cabin
hasnt moved though they are strangers they are at least entitled to a christian burial
shaking his head let us go miss
i will not
i have seen the face of war before mr
poe but never war made on women and children
and almost as cruel is your indifference
hawkeye turns back and rapidly approaches her
she takes a step back fearful
contained miss munro
pause they are not strangers
and they stay as they lay
realizes hawkeye knew these people and is deeply affected
she also realizes for the first time this is a whole new world with dynamics and complexities behavior and rhythms she doesnt understand
he turns away from her and walks on
she hesitates a moment
as chingachgook and hawkeye extremely alert and cradling their cocked flintlocks walk to camera eyes sweeping the forest perimeter theyre followed by cora heyward helping alice and uncas as rearguard
the ruined cabin and the dead dream of a family smolders behind them
moves through to where the trees seem sparse and are unnaturally white birch and some thin grass grows
the land rises into a mound
chingachgook and the others avoid stepping on the grass and cross to the other side of it
mutters something to uncas
he nods and disappears amongst the white birch soundlessly
throws heyward a blanket
heyward spreads the blanket below the top of the mound and maintaining silence he gestures for cora alice to rest there
hits the blanket
she curls into a fetal position and shes out
heyward is nearby on watch
hawkeye has taken a position two thirds of the way around the crescent shaped mound
cora has sought him out
doesnt react as cora enters
hes scanning the trees not looking at her
why didnt you bury those people
anyone lookin to pick up our trail would see it as a sign of our passing
you knew them
hawkeye looks at her and nods
stiffly you were acting for our benefit
and i apologize
i misunderstood you
well that is to be expected
he warned me about people like you
do not try to make them understand you
and do not try to understand them
that is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense
coras indignation is cut off because
he gestures back the way he came and it means theyre in jeopardy
uncas disappears around the mound
imperceptibly we move closer and start to see shapes blocking out part of the white birch
a ruff of red hair stands straight up at the back of the large mans head
slit and monstrously elongated earlobes are weighted with silver
hes followed by others
wary silently they hunt
towards the rear are two french rangers coureurs des bois from le regiment de la sarre
theyre bearded dirty dressed indian style in moccasins leggings and breechcloths with hooded hunting shirts
theres nothing clumsy about them
theyre the th century version of special forces whove gone indigenous
if they and the ottawa find our people its all over
seeing the red painted ottawa approach starts to panic
her hyperventilating and involuntary small sounds of fear will reveal their position
a hand covers her mouth and silences her struggling
his other arm is around her holding her looking towards the advancing ottawa
on his back his tomahawk within reach on the ground
are fifty yards away from the crescent mound behind which lie our people
mist envelops them
his massive arms spread revealing his war club in his left fist his fusil in his right hand
waiting for the attack
coras eyes are anxious but theres no terror there
nathaniels impressed with her cool
he hands her a pistol
she takes it
he listens for the soft drop of moccasined feet
through the grass
thirty feet away they stop
then their leader gestures and they start backing out
the french rangers continue towards the crescent
the ottawa chief takes ones arm and stops him
the french ranger whispers something inaudible
the ottawa chief shakes his head non
and means it
tensely monitor the ottawa retreat
he slowly removes his hand from her mouth
shes a little shy then she looks up catches his eyes
then she averts her face
sees all of it doesnt like it
the ottawa are gone
quietly why did they turn back
in answer hawkeye looks behind above her head
turns and makes out stilt platforms of skeletons and torn strips of buckskin silhouetted against the night sky in the distance
they have camped on sanctified ground a burial place
she thinks it would be a mistake to ever underestimate the skill of these men or the danger complexity of this place
she hands the pistol back to him
their hands almost touch
still pissed off were a breed apart and we make no sense
smiles in your particular case miss i would make some allowance
sarcastic thank you so much
cora is angry
hawkeye staring at the trees glances at her
she settles looking at him
her mood changes
you called chingachgook your father
where is your real family
hawkeyes surprised by her question
they buried my ma pa and my sisters
and chingachgook who found me with two french trappers raised me up as his own
i do not remember them
i was one or two
how did you learn english
my father sent uncas i to reverend wheelocks school when i was ten
so we would know both worlds
though we were told only bother learning readin arithmetic from yous
and what were the consequentialities of european culture you didnt bother with
many wrong ideas about the government of men
my fathers people already know each man is his own nation
and only he can have dominion over himself
no man is better than any other man
in london those radical ideas could land you in newgate prison
changing the subject why were those people living in this defenseless place
cos frontier lands the only land affordable to poor people
so after seven years indentured service in virginia they headed out here where they are beholden to none and not livin by anothers leave
their name was cameron
cora sees the slate grey clouds and in between the fields of stars
she looks at hawkeye then again up at the night sky
continuing looking up my fathers people say
at the birth of the sun and of his brother the moon their mother died
so the sun gave to the earth her body from which was to spring all life
and he drew forth from her breast the stars
the stars he threw into the night sky to remind him of her soul
the sky so there is the camerons monument
my folks too i guess
hawkeyes watching her
her reaction is enigmatic
after a pause
low you are right mr
we do not understand what is happening here
and it is not as i imagined it would be thinking of it in boston and london
sorry to disappoint you
eyes downcast on the contrary
it is more deeply stirring
to my blood
then up into his eyes than any imagining could possibly have been
she closes her eyes turns slightly and prepares to sleep
hawkeye is the one left staring into the birch forest a little surprised
some of his assumptions about her were wrong
deep fog has set in
a hand entering the frame scares the hell out of us
it moves a branch aside
spread to the right is chingachgook far to the left is hawkeye
they hike up a steep forested slope in the heart of the adirondacks
top of this ridge
fort and lake george are downhill of it
re energized her spirits pick up
will we be able to bathe
before cora can answer they hear a deep rolling roar
alice is alarmed
papa will arrange something
looks over his shoulder sees something in the far distance gestures to hawkeye and chingachgook
and the band of red painted ottawa and coureurs des bois who have now split into two groups are still on their trail
the men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake build fires and provide every comfort you desire alice
duncan you are absolutely gallant
if cora doesnt marry you i shall
hawkeye sees them
it bothers us will these europeans including cora shed their frontier experience
i cant wait to see papa
and you duncan
what are you looking forward to
posting to a different continent
he and alice laugh
cora does not
i think its very important and exciting
heyward looks at her
shes not kidding
as he does he stares at coras seperation and now her proximity to hawkeye whos walking on ahead is something heyward doesnt like
his dark thoughts are distracted by a flash of light and more rolling thunder
drops and pulls cora to the ground
hawkeye doesnt answer as he chingachgook uncas and heyward make their way to the top of the ridge
join them and look down upon their expectation of a secure piece of england in the wilderness a safe harbor a fathers warm welcome
is none of those things
the thunder is the roar of french siege cannon clouded in dense smoke
the flashes of light are mortar bombs exploding and illumination rockets red glare
fort william henry is under a massive siege by a french and huron army
looks over his shoulder
theres no way back
theyre propelled forward
french cannons roar black smoke and gouts of red flame
dug by sappeurs behind the cover of a huge gambio pushed toward the fort by two poles and fascis on the sides
searching the night
light the battlefield revealing the french trenches
colonial militia and mohawk snipers fire their rifles
the british gun crew scrambles to adjust their pounders
french cannon fire rips into the fortifications exploding wood and earth shredding the english gun crew with cannister
the english fight stubbornly but we feel theyre outgunned
a new artillery duel erupts
the action is to the west side of the fort
on the north the fire fight is reflected on the black water of lake george in our foreground
then a dark shape wiping to the right cuts off those reflections
we see in silhouette the outline of a birch canoe moving silently barely rippling the mirrored surface of the lake
behind it two canadiens and a huron alternately snipe at the ramparts
behind them is black water
its surface is broken by the rising mass of chingachgook followed by uncas and hawkeye
muzzle flashes from the cannon reveal the canoe and the forms of the girls further out
chingachgooks war club is held low
the huron senses and turns and hawkeyes thrown tomahawk knocks him back
hawkeyes knife flashes in the night
chingachgook drives the war club up smashing a canadien onto the debris
the second canadien jabs bayonet at uncas slashing his side
uncas jerks him forward by the musket folds him over and tomahawks him
amidst the cannonade roar ad libbed shouts from hawkeye and heyward convince battle begrimed soldiers to open the sally port
our people rush in
the group moves through the long dank tunnel
enlisted men escorting them
another torch from the other direction captain beams is revealed
im major duncan heyward
captain jeffrey beams
we didnt think youd make it through
wheres colonel munro
his daughters are here too
beams raises his torch sees the muddied soaked women
he is shocked that they traveled with heyward
emerges from a sally port tunnel
noise is deafening
the group has traveled through a nightmare only to arrive in hell
run diagonally past pyramidal stacks of cannon ball smoldering beams and shrapnel wounded men
just then a mortar is fired and explodes killing the gun crew
on the ramparts mohawks and colonial militia sniping at the french
women huddle in corners next to the sick and dying
shouts over roar uncas
one wounded man ian intercepts uncas
thought you and nathaniel werent joinin up
on the run didnt
dropped in to see how you boys is doin
running from his quarters is shocked to see them
hysterical papa papa
enraged why are you here
cora is stunned
alice is decimated by her fathers anger
munro sees and whips off his coat to cover them and takes alice under his arm
alice clings while they race for the cover of his quarters to heyward re alice cora why did you allow them to come
and where the bloody hell are my reinforcements
they race into the yellow lantern light of munros quarters and slam and bolt the heavy door
embracing his daughters softer told you to stay away from this hell hole
why did you disobey me
there was none
there was no letter
i sent three men to webb
one called magua arrived
he delivered no such message
does webb not even know we are besieged
webb has no idea
and he certainly does not know to send reinforcements
munro has nowhere for his rage to go
meanwhile alice clings to her father
at the british army has been his life
he blindly believes in its institutions though officers like webb would disdain his scots origins
from under his fury flat what happened to you
suddenly tired ambush
on the george road
this magua led us into it
pause eighteen killed
its these men who saved us
they guided us here
how can i reward you
help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores
to uncas im indebted to you
and get your side sewn up young man
sees his exhausted and bloodstained surgeon in the doorway that leads to the next rooms
phelps face lights up when he sees cora munro
how are you
smiles fine mr
have you cat gut and a suturing needle
for uncas and we could use some rum clothes and a place to wash
cora tries to remove alice from her father but she clings to him
munro holds her tighter
then he whispers something to her
she nods her head
and cora takes her
is moved beyond words by his daughters presence
theres a break a pause
to heyward over table map what a place for them
might i enquire after the situation sir given that ive seen of the french engineering from the ridge above
perfunctory logistics are his guns are bigger than mine and he has more of them
they keep our heads down while his sappers make thirty yards of trench a day
his thirteen inch mortars have a two hundred yard range so when theyre close enough theyll move them in lob explosive rounds over our walls and pound us to dust
they look to be three hundred yards out
you have three days
a man here can make a run straight through to webb
not enough time to get to albany and back with reinforcements
a sergeant enters snaps to attention says something to beams exits
webbs not in albany
he marched the rd to fort edward two days ago
webbs at edward
only twelve miles away
he could be here day after tomorrow
to hawkeye find your man sir
captain beams will give you the message
munro turns back to the map
hawkeye has something else to say
john camerons cabin
we come upon it last night
and it was ottawa
theyre allied to the french
munro looks at him
it was a war party
it means theyre on the attack up and down the frontier
munro turns to look at him for a long beat
munro doesnt like what his response must be to this news
he turns to heyward and the map
cold thank you
hawkeyes dismissed frozen out
many men here their homes are in the path
thats all sir
hawkeye is furious
chingachgook gestures hawkeye out
he leaves munros quarters almost knocking over an entering adjutant who backs way up to let chingachgook pass
things were done
nobody was spared
terrible feature of war in the americas
beat a mantra best to keep your sight fixed on our duty
our duty is to defeat france
that hangs on a courier to webb
of three seneca women and five boys led by a jesuit sing the te deum in the iroquois language
this is a large tent that could sleep twenty
montcalms four personal guards are at the entrance as well as comte de levis in dirty lace a facial wound and a braceful of pistols on a sash
inside is simple campaign furniture and a six by eight foot battle standard and flag of france
stands with a huge and fearsome elaborately tattooed and robed seneca chief in a silk turban
low and the black robes of michilimackinac left us no time to put our cabins in order before telling us our french father had need of our aid
we rolled our blankets and were the first to be here
yet we are not the first and closest to my fathers campfire
the marquis de montcalm is forty five wears a large wampum belt as a sash over his waistcoat
he has an acute intellect an elegant manner
he is more aristocratic than munro but a consummate professional soldier
over the senecas shoulder montcalm sees and nods to
entering with four huron braves
this is not the magua we saw on the trail
in his scalp lock now red stained and cut to a huron roach are three blacl plumes
a match coat blanket drapes his left shoulder
to seneca chief for my children and the children of the true faith my friendship and esteem is boundless
i will give you three oxen for a feast and tomorrow i myself will sing the war song with you in the great council house
the seneca chief is satisfied and his people plus the jesuit exit
the look on maguas face and the wry expression on montcalms allows us to understand their relationship is based on realpolitik
le renard subtil how are things with your english friends
magua exhales in derision as he brings a chair to face montcalm and sits european style
over his shoulder louis antoine join us
louis antoine de bougainville enters
he wears a functional melange of indian moccasins over white linen breeches and an officers waistcoat
hear what le subtil has to tell us
bougainville published a book on integral calculus at twenty five at twenty six was a secretary to the french ambassador in london in january at twenty seven he was elected
a member of the british royal academy of science and at age twenty eight hes aide de camp to the marquis de montcalm with the rank of captain
later in life he brought bougainvillea from tahiti to europe to america
english war chief webb goes to fort edward with rd regiment
he does not know my fathers army attacks fort william henry
but by now munro knows his couriers didnt get through
hell send another
the grey hair will try
four or five including two women entered the fort
the grey hairs children were under maguas knife but escaped
theyll be under it again
why do hate the grey hair magua
when the grey hair is dead magua will eat his heart
before he dies magua will put his children under the knife so the grey hair will see his seed is wiped out forever
montcalm wont get a direct answer
my sappeurs are advancing the trenches through the night now
you may have your opportunity soon
exhausted sitting on a low stool taking a breath
she know what shes doin
phelps looks up then he looks over his shoulder at cora
shes in a borrowed launderess dress blouse
she looks different
hes a little indignant
first assisted me in austria when she was fourteen
i would say she does
her apron is stained
hawkeye sees this may be her first time in the new world but its not her first military campaign
still angered at munros dismissive response hes nevertheless falling for cora
she does not shy away from much
elsewhere whats that
alice munro has caught hawkeyes attention
outside the surgery where a casement meets a wall she sits withdrawn
a catatonic older woman in a fine dress sits next to her
gentleman looking for you
coras sewing up uncas
looks up mr poe
re cotton may i
cora curious nods
hawkeye cuts some pieces from her ruined and discarded dress that she now uses to bandage uncas
we dont know why neither does cora
to uncas you bout done holdin hands with miss munro
uncas laughs looking from her to hawkeye
then hes up and he hurts
cora starts to tend another wounded man
as they start out hawkeye hesitates
sensing it cora turns
what are you looking at mr
why i am looking at you miss
cora measures the directness of hawkeyes manner
its not insolent only unsettling
feeling foolish she turns
having worked through the night are still digging the diagonally advancing trench
we note its closer than it was
at their posts guard the sappeurs
ten mohawks and rangers crawl towards the french lines
are low and out of french sight in the northeast battery
four others are with them including captain jack
stacked rifles are against the casement
we dont know why
each rifle is within reach of hawkeyes hand
hawkeye is taking extra care loading killdeer
he charges it once then overloads the powder by a quarter charge
you told him about the raid
nods he does not want to hear it
pause but he is gonna have to
to one man get together by the west battery james ian sharitarish william
hawkeye uses the fine cotton he took from cora
uncas sees it
another forty yards
hawkeye wets it to make a tighter gas seal and rams it home
the tighter fit requires more effort
looks below to ground level
two pistols are holstered in a sash around his chest
he wears no hat and carries no pack
he waits by the sally port door
are suddenly tomahawked and knifed by stripped down nd highlanders and mohawks
alarm is raised
french and some huron run to advance
shots are fired
the rangers mohawks fall back
suddenly heyward and three companies of the nd regiment of foot men are over the top in perfect formation
form three ranks
bellows to troops upon the center wheel to the left about
three motions drums rear ranks proper distance
the rear ranks back up six paces front ranks take your distance
everybody moves halt
in unison they slam to a stop make ready
muskets snap to port arms dodge right left of the nds line of fire
are coming forward
their sergeants trying to stop and form their men in ad libbed french
dead cool first rank
muskets shouldered fire
like one shot lightening smoke and
caliber death screams from the first two ranks like a scythe cutting down
fourteen wounded or killed
hes oblivious to incoming rounds
a piece of hat is blown off epaulet is shot off
the man next to him is killed and bloodies heywards coat
advance sergeant major
to soldiers third rank
the rear rank walks through the first two ranks who are priming and loading in perfect order to their sergeant majors commands
as the third rank becomes the first rank
sprints for the trees during the diversion of heywards sally
materialize from nowhere and charge at him
both are blown off their feet by
now handed already loaded primed and cocked rifles while the four men behind them reload the two just fired
are running down the hill to intercept the courier
a near miss
a half second later uncas fires
one canadiens falling through the trees as the second ones hit by uncas shot
reaches out his hand
killdeer with the heavier load is slapped into it
looks away a second and comes back to the sight in deep concentration
the world goes silent
pursuer are barely visible
only patches appear momentarily between the trees
theyre three hundred yards away an impossible shot in
will intersect the courier
his arm is back with his tomahawk to throw
judges wind elevates the long rifle
and fires at us
hawkeyes heavy round rips through
we hear the ball cut air
a few leaves flutter
whacked head over heels by the impact
looks over his shoulder
he didnt know the canadien was there
he stumbles in the half light
then he runs on
the three companies of the nd regiment of foot file back into the fort in perfect order
the sally port is closed
three men are wounded
the diversion worked perfectly
thank you sergeant major
thank the men
have seen no action for three days nights
heyward got their blood running and won their respect
they step aside and nod to him
heyward keeps walking
he is home
a knock and heyward enters
alice is in her fathers bed
cora is collecting and tearing linen into strips for bandaging
i wanted to talk to you but ill come back another time
alice looks at the two of them and rises out of the bed
talk to duncan cora
i must manage
i cannot be an invalid schoolgirl
starts for door ill see if mr
phelps needs anything
im sorry i didnt mean to
her nerves are shattered
shes trying to be brave
theres a lot going on under coras surface
we dont know what it is but its disconcerting
cora i adore you and when we come together we will be the happiest couple in england
i am certain of that
more than ever before
softens i believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts
pause duncan i promised you an answer
you have complimented me with your persistence and patience
but the decision ive come to is id rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment
heyward is stunned
and its been unfair to you while i search myself for feelings which if they were there and as strong as they ought to be wouldve made themselves known long
pause take my admiration and friendship duncan
and please take this as my final answer
it must be no
heyward shattered inside
i am sorry duncan
hes errect as he leaves the room
the tension rushes out of her and she shudders and leans against the quarter timbered walls for support
then she collects the linen and starts out
moving through the corridor past wounded
two french mortar bombs explode above one of the casements
we hear shrill screams in the distance and
it was no raidin party out for pillage
the cabin was attacked by a war party
they are sweeping south down the frontier spreading terror among farms and mohawk villages cos all the men are here
and my cabins not thirteen miles south of camerons
cora passing the open door to munros crowded office now hesitates
hawkeye captain jack winthrop ian seven or eight other militia spokesmen munro heyward two adjutants one lieutenant of rangers
to jack i must receive proof more conclusive than mr
poes opinion before i weaken our defenses by allowing militia to withdraw
chingachgooks of the same opinion
taken together thats gospel
your fort will stand or fall depending on webb and reinforcements not these colonials presence
i judge military matters captain winthrop not you
that judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with webb to defend their farms families
major heyward was at john camerons
he saw what it was
looking to heyward for confirmation of his point of view what did you see major
heyward looks around the room
and he catches the doorway
beyond the periphery of men staring at him
munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of british military interests
at the same time
examines him with a cool level stare
looks at munro
more french rounds detonate o
what if webb gets here and they need to launch a counter attack
they need every man they have
its his moment of decision
to munro i saw nothing that would lead me to the conclusion it was other than a raid by savages bent on thievery
jack winthrop grabs nathaniel
youre a liar
heywards stature has fallen irrevocably in her eyes
cant help it
he turns to look at cora
suffused with an inner sadness turns to hawkeye
and the blood is on your hands
heyward reaches for his sword
to heyward ill have none of that
to colonials montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman
not a butcher
easy for you to suppose
while it is their women and children not yours alone in their farms
exploding you forget yourself
we are not forgettin webbs promise
british promises are honored
and the militia will not be released
because i need more definite proof than this mans word
nathaniels word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here
this interviews over
the militia stays
to munro does the rule of english law no longer govern
has it been replaced by absolutism
this is very dangerous talk
and if english law cannot be trusted maybe these people would do better makin a peace with the french
that is sedition
that is the truth
restaining himself i ought to have you whipped from this fort
changes down some day i think you and i are gonna have a serious disagreement
steel anyone fomenting or advocating leaving fort william henry will be hung for sedition
anyone leaving will be shot for desertion
pause my decision is final
hawkeye and the others are not intimidated
their rage smolders
the look on hawkeyes face says this is not over
sparks shower skyward
some celtic proto bluegrass played on fiddle drums
laundresses dance from soldier to soldier english foot and american rangers
a few people lit by the firelight are solemn
most are stirred to lift their morale for a while
underlit by the red firelight
they are a disposable people a diverse plurality stuck in a postage stamp size fort in an ocean of forest locked into mortal deadly conflict because of the policies of
cold and distant european monarchs
we can barely make out the eyes and faces of a number of men behind logs crates and new wreckage from the days bombardment
low got no kin in the settlements
if i did id be long gone
you didnt think it right to be here in the first place
by my light thats how i saw it then and i see it that way now
low but we are under english military authority
low i believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish their law no longer has rightful authority over us
all they have over us is tyranny then
and ill stay here no longer
no force on earth will keep me here
anyone caught leavin the fort could be shot
so each man make your own decision
those who are goin be back here in an hour
out the northern sally port
strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the french picket line
head north over the ridge then come about southeast and fork left in little meadow and youre free of the outpost and skirmishers
grumbles shouldve skinned outta this long ago
got no families captain
figured wed stay and give em a hand even though
to colonial ill cover them from the top of the casement
in amazement youre not coming with us
hawkeye shakes his head
got a reason to stay
that reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery
low laughter dry it does and it is a better lookin reason than you jack winthrop
more laughs push hard cos you got to clear the french outpost by dawn
sticks out his hand and grasps winthrops good luck jack
the men split up
wanders among the dancers and musicians clustered in groups lit by the firelight
someone catches his eye and he moves in that direction
in the shadows leaning against the wall searching
we sense shes been looking for him
he comes up to her
she turns in surprise
somehow she breathes easier because hes there
shes in a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up
hawkeye leads her away from some of the people
hawkeye takes coras hand
cora is awakening to a new spirit a new wind blowing through a new land a new self determination
shes drawn to this rough yet graceful man with his direct manner
hawkeye settles against a wall
she leans next to him
their shoulders touch
to her everything about him seems to be somehow right
shes discovered that the passions and outrage that move him move her
and her readiness to give herself to what stirs the deepest resonances of her soul is the same as his
looks at her
shes beautiful in the firelight
coras eyes find his and she folds into his arms
his lips find hers and tears stream down her face
shes suffused with an elation she cant explain
in the night before doomsday a romance is born in rebellion amid the huddled people in this small stockade ripped from the black earth of the forests of a wild
door crashes inwards
twelve british sentries storm in
four bear torches
are out of the bunks and moving with them with tomahawks knives a flintlock
their muskets aimed mostly at hawkeye
as you were
the others slow down indecisive
hawkeye drops his tomahawk and says something in mohican to restrain chingachgook and uncas
the british in the torchlight with the long muskets and bayonets are an image out of goya
hawkeyes spun around and while his hands are bound
mohican subtitled why do they make my son prisoner
mohican subtitled i helped winthrop and the others leave
this fight is not yours father
i love you and my brother
and you should leave this place now and go to can tuck ee
mohican subtitled what will they do with my white son
one of the guards scared to death by chingachgook nervously fingers his musket
get back from him
shrugs in answer to chingachgooks question
as he passes heyward his eyes lock on his
he saved us
we are alive only because of him
heyward munro cora
weve entered mid argument
an adjutant comes and goes
heyward and munro are sensitive to appearances in front of the adjutant
cora couldnt give a damn
the man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room in my presence
he is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal regardless of what he did for my children
he knew the consequences
and he stayed
are those the actions of a criminal
duncan do something
he knew the penalty for breaking regulations
he ought to pay without sending you to beg
you know he wouldnt send me
you misrepresented what you saw and caused this
frustrated i too was at that farm
it was as he said
not with enough certainty to outweigh british interests in this fort
and who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon englands policies in her own colonies
to come and go without so much as a by your leave
they do not live their lives by your leave
they hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands burying their dead and their children along the way
distant you are defending him because youve become infatuated with him
cora is having her intelligence written off as a hormone attack
she contains her fury
duncan you are a man with a few admirable qualities
but taken as a whole i was wrong to have thought so highly of you
heywards shot through the heart
but the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon
if thats justice
then the sooner french guns blow the english army out of america the better it will be for these people
you do not know what you are saying
explodes yes i do
i know exactly what i am saying
and if it is sedition then i am guilty of sedition too
she exits leaving them there
heavy timbered door
they stand at attention when cora passes as opposed to barring her entry
comes to the door grips the bars with his hands and looks at cora
they are silent for a moment then
cant ask you in
coras pale smile
theyre going to hang you
pause soft why didnt you leave when you had the chance
because what i am interested in is right here
what would you have me do
he touches her hand
webbs reinforcements will arrive or not
if they do not arrive the fort will fall
if that happens stay close to your father
the french will protect the officer class among the english
i will find you
pause promise me
cora drops her forehead to hawkeyes hands wrapped around the bars
she acquiesces nods
then heavy shelling commences
cora hawkeye look up
mortar bombs begin striking the fortress
the final french bombardment has started
the whole worlds on fire isnt it
this part of it sure is
reaching through the bars set in the thick door their hands clasp each others
on that image
french cannoneers in batteries and fire again and again
they work like precision drill teams
ending in battery is complete and surprisingly close to william henrys walls
crews reload the squat and massive newly arrived thirteen inch mortars
the flash hole is primed
the burning fuse is jammed into the bomb
the primer charge is lit off and the crew ducks as the crude iron belches red flame and black smoke into the lightening sky
the second mortar roars
then a third
tries to return fire but cant under the heavy french bombardment
the french mortar bomb arcs in and explodes smoke flame and shrapnel wiping out most of the crew
the fortress is under the heaviest attack weve seen
wounded are in shock or terrorized
another mortar bomb arcs in and explodes part of a building and casement starting a fire
another lands in the grounds
it doesnt explode
one soldier dashes to rip out the fuse
as his hand is inches away
protects cora through the bars as she half sleeps through the muffled roar
then the thundering stops
hawkeye seperates himself from her and crosses to the window
bows deeply to major beams
a french honor guard of five men is behind him
a white scarf is on his sword tip
the fresh destruction of the fort is apparent
crosses to an awakened cora
he touches her face
hes desperate to drill these next words into her brain
what is it
i dont know
whatever happens you stay with your father
you stay among the officers
cora looks up at hawkeye
we feel forboding
are heard drums
the drums are from munros honor guard
marquis de montcalm immaculate backed by his guard of honor in white grey and medium blue with six foot by eight foot regimental colors and the french flag gold fleur
de lis on a field of blue
they carried two hundred and forty five bateaux across a ten mile portage all their supplies and artillery and then rowed down the length of lake george to get here
to them assaulting this fort is the easy part
the drummers of the honor guard play a tattoo behind them
huron ottawa osage choctaw fox
hear the drum of the honor guard and wait
theyre in war paint
the osage scalping locks are hennaed red
canadiens among them are bearded dirty half savage
at their head
in full war paint with a coterie of huron warriors silent waiting
grim silent watchful
watching the parlay from a blown apart battery
and their honor guards
montcalm steps forward and sweeps his plumed hat to the ground in a courtly bow
munro bows coldly
colonel munro i have known you as a gallant antagonist
i am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend
and i to make yours monsieur le marquis
please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress
under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material
mere chance has allowed me to array against you
monsieur le marquis i am a soldier not a diplomat
you called this parlay for a reason
you have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your prince
i will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope
but now i beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity
i beg you to consider my terms for your surrender
however i may apprise such testimony from monsieur montcalm fort william henry is strong and stands
honor that is freely accorded to courage may be refused obstinacy
these hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and i am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves
is webb really en route and montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before british reinforcements arrive
perhaps the generals glasses can reach to the hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of webb
montcalm takes a moment to reply and appears genuinely sympathetic to munro
quietly my scouts intercepted this dispatch intended for you
munro is puzzled suspicious
to bougainville read the dispatch
reading colonel munro fort william henry
i have no men available to send to your rescue
it is impossible
i advise you to seek terms for surrender
munro is rocked as if struck by a blow
bougainville hands heyward the letter
confirming this is the signature of webb
to munro and i know the temper of our men
rather than spend the war in a french prison hulk in hudson bay theyd fight to the end
to montcalm you have heard your answer monsieur le marquis
salutes munro starts off
montcalm stops him
challengingly i am incapable of mistreating brave men
i beg you not to sign the death warrant of so many until you have listened to my terms
my master requires the fort be destroyed
but for you and your comrades there is no privilege that will be denied
none of your men will see the inside of a prison barge
theyre free to go so long as they return to england and fight no more on this continent and the civilian militia return to their farms
they may leave the fortress fully armed but with no ammunition
other than that ask what you wish
munros impressed with montcalms generosity
the honors of war
carry them to england to your king with pride
allow me to consult with my officers
as he turns away somethings been disconnected inside munro that can never get put back together
as the men move away from the french
i have lived to see two things i never expected
an englishman afraid to support a friend
and a frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage
general webb can burn in hell
well go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts
our mission is to fight
flares death and honor are sometimes thought to be the same
today i have learned that they are not
munro looks at the fortress behind him
stops him with his eyes the decision is final
then munro turns toward montcalm
their eyes meet across the churned scarred earth of the battlefield
i am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity
the fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over
to your surgeon
and montcalm bows deeply and as he does so
passes away from the little city of tents in the direction of the beach and towards william henry
he seems to head towards a vantage point from which to observe the fort
as he approaches a sentry qui vive
le mot dordre
cest bien vous vous promenez bien matin monsieur
il est necessaire detre vigilant mon enfant
the cloak parts
by the light of the moon the mans face is dimly perceived by us and the soldier as general montcalm
the soldier snaps erect as montcalm continues walking out beyond the line to a small stand of trees
the moon is broken into pieces of light on the water and behind montcalm from the front of the stand of trees emerges a tall figure
is the hatchet buried between the english and my french father
not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends
my master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the english squatters
they have consented to go
so now he calls them enemies no longer
magua took the hatchet to color it with blood
it is still bright
only when it is red then it will be buried
but so many suns have set since le renard struck the war post
is he not tired
where is that sun
it has gone behind the hill
it is dark and cold
it has set on his people they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the european masters who are always greedy for
more than they need
threatening and le subtil is the son of his tribe
there have been many clouds and many mountains
but now he has come to lead his nation
that le renard has the power to lead his people into the light i know well
magua grabs the hand of the french commander
imperceptible surprise in montcalms eyes
magua jams montcalms fingers to his chest
does my father know that
a deep indentation and scar
thats where a lead bullet has torn you
magua turns his naked back to montcalm and puts montcalms hand on his back
deep ridges of a scar a half inch wide
my son has been sadly injured
who did this
laughs sardonic magua slept hard in the english wigwams
and the sticks left their mark
pause for real maguas village and lodges were burnt
maguas children were killed by the english
magua was taken as a slave by the mohawks who fought for the grey hair
maguas wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another
the grey hair was the father of all this
pause in time magua became blood brother to mohawk to become free
in his heart he always was huron
and his heart will be whole again on the day when the grey hair and all his seed are dead
my son maguas pain is my pain
does the chief of the canadas believe the english will keep the terms
but general webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake
having let them go i fear i will only fight the same men again when i move south
pause shrugs and yet i cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of france
long pause wheels turn
then many things my french father cannot do magua can
montcalm reacts as if he hadnt thought of that
as the english march away our soldiers and the canadiens will be drawn to the looting of the fort
except for a small guard
magua abruptly leaves montcalm
walking back to the huron camp
reveal a huron sub chief has been in the woods waiting for magua
now he joins him
they walk in silence
in iroquois re montcalm i wonder at the blindness and pride of the white man
he believes only he knows how to speak falsely to make other men do his bidding
magua exhales in derision
at the end of the column rides out on his horse
both sides of the gate are jammed with armed french troops standing at attention
the french colors and honor guard are just outside the gate along with bougainville chevalier de levis both on horseback as is at the head montcalm
trots past his walking column out the gate
he does not look at the french
salutes munro and bows gravely from the saddle
eyes forward monsieur the fort is yours
marching with his rd regiment of foot well beyond the fort
the french troops have thinned out
repressing shame his backbone is rigid his face is straight ahead
the rd marches in perfect cadence to the drum
in the b
munro on his horse passes heyward as he rides towards the front of his column
heyward does not look at him
on the back of a mare
alice living through a wide awake nightmare is huddled under the arm of her sister
they ride behind the standard bearers
in the b
her father is seen approaching and takes his position at their side
cora looks down the column sheilding her eyes against the sun
we know who shes looking for
the nd and nd highlanders including heyward
thirty to forty women and a number of children for safety in the middle some frontiersmen ongewasgone and many mohawk walking wounded
the column is still snaking its way out of the fort
straining to see
being assembled their hands shackled
hawkeye is among twelve or thirteen
he stands erect walking out of the gate
the french are starting to pour in to loot the interior
hawkeye looks to his left about twenty paces in front of him and sees
on the other side of the column
chingachgook cradles killdeer as well as his own musket
they fall back to walk beside the prisoners on the other side of hawkeye
their eyes connect
we dont expect hawkeye to stay shackled for the duration
a few insults
the british soldiers answer
nobody breaks rank
its just talk
his eyes sweep the column snaking its way into the v shaped valley
the path cuts through the forested hills ahead
riding near the front where there are no more french soldiers
only a few scattered and curious huron and ottawa
she does not see him
as it passes left to right below like a long snake through the narrow valley
were shooting from inside the dark woods
lower in the light we see a scattering on both slopes of a couple of hundred ottawa and huron
they are in no order are spread out and dont constitute a threat
they watch the column
slowly the camera
slides across the shoulders and back of a large man wearing black plumes in his scalp lock and other than a breechcloth is almost naked
he is heavily war painted
and the left two thirds of his face is painted red
the right third is painted black
much silver is in his ears
his tomahawk is in his left hand
his cut down musket in his right fist
maguas attention is all focused to one point
at the head of the column
this is the focus of maguas attention
cora turns again to look for hawkeye
doesnt see him but something else has caught her eye
running toward the column
just one man
hes running and whooping like a dog charging from his masters front yard
the huron arrives at the column his tomahawk swings into his hand and he brains a british trooper who falls dead
the single huron never breaks stride
he simply runs off again
horrified holds alice tighter
has seen it too
and now he sees
a large sergeant unsheathes a two handed claymore facing the hurons and other indians
of the rd present arms
did they violate the surrender by carrying ammunition
locks are cocked
theres the answer
no one fires
are watching what happens
to sergeant major men are to stay in file sergeant major
drums beat the cadence
step over the fallen soldier
heads turn theyre on edge
they exchange looks
this is not good
chingachgook cocks both killdeer and his own musket
we start to make out details in the shadow
we become accustomed to the dimness
now in the lower light we see deeper in the forest
many huron and ottawa are hidden in the shadows
theyre moving along parallel to the column stalking it
racing down the hill from the opposite flank towards the nd
look at their sergeant
they wait until hes within ten feet of the column
both bayonet the indian
saw what happened
but they hold their ranks
among the british are slipping tomahawks into their hands surreptitiously
some are cocking flintlocks
gallops his horse away from cora and alice towards the scene of the last attack
we hear him from the distance ordering
do not break ranks
i want these ranks to hold
he saw munro leave cora
he knows events have a momentum and its accelerating
move next to the sergeant with the shackle keys who looks at them curiously as
with children nervously search the threatening trees hoping against hope these are isolated incidents
draws his sword and is passing orders to his sergeant major scanning the hills
his eyes see munro
raises his musket in his fist and emits a war whoop
we now see
hundreds have been stalking the column hidden in the trees maybe thousands
fire from the trees crescendos within seconds revealing a spontaneous and massive ambush of mostly hurons
they appear from behind every tree and it turns to a roar of musket fire war whoops and screams as
dropping like flies and seemingly thousands of hurons attack down both slopes
is being unshackled by uncas
the sergeant is rising from the ground where chingachgook knocked him
chingachgook throws hawkeye killdeer and hawkeye shrugs into his pouch and powder horn as he races with uncas for the head of the column
charging down the hill
with his coterie of twenty huron warriors heading for the area in which he saw munro
at the head of the disintegrating column
coras holding alices head to her bosom covering her ears as if to protect her from the sounds
right about face
first rank present
the volley knocks down fifteen of a horde of attacking hurons
second rank six paces forward
hurons are twenty yards away and closing
as the line of muskets belch smoke and fire
were shooting into the v of the valley with hurons and other tribes pouring down from both sides
important the combined musket fire of hurons english and mohawks generates tremendous clouds of smoke which obscure action close off views isolate pockets of combat into surreal tableaux that well
move in and out of
using their useless muskets as clubs or with fixed bayonets as the smoke and fog swirls among the men fighting for their lives
glides through the scenes striking and hunting
some of his coterie of braves near him
hugging the ground in fear
magua throws her over
its not alice munro
its a woman protecting her baby
magua walks on
one of the braves behind magua raise his tomahawk
on his downswing
running through surreal patches thinks he glimpses cora two hundred yards away
chingachgook on hawkeyes left slams down two hurons with his war club
running through the chaos and murder and british troopers and mohawks locked in struggle with hurons
coras dress is torn
she holds alice to her
theres a pistol in coras hand
scalping a prone soldier rips the trophy from his head turns and faces us
shoots him in the face
and her eyes take it all in
and her affect starts to flatten
a blankness suffuses her expression and the girl withdraws from this reality into a deep dark cave inside her head
locked in combat
he tomahawks one hurons arm with a slashing downstroke and comes right back into the face of the second with his backswing while his right hand fires killdeer at
six feet from uncas and about to shoot him in the back
free for a moment spins
he has no idea of direction any more
everything is death in strange tableaux
meanwhile hollering cora
he cuts down a huron with his sword who is trying to leap at him from the right
an osage warrior with red scalp lock leaps on the back of munros horse reaching over to stab down into munros neck
the old mans left hand grabs the warriors knife hand in an iron grip
his right hand pulls his horse pistol and under his upraised arm fires backward point blank blowing the osage off the back of his horse
just then munros mount is shot
his horse rears up throws munro and falls on him
shouting orders over the deafening noise
second rank fire
six paces back
a well oiled well drilled fighting machine but there are fewer of them
theyre getting cut off
they close ranks automatically as a man drops
theyre retreating in perfect order
about to strike a downwards blow is pushed aside by magua
his eyes drop to whats in front of him
the field goes quiet
his lower body is trapped under his dead horse
magua leans in towards him
i will cut your heart from your living chest in front of your eyes
as you die know that i will put under the knife your children and wipe your seed from this earth forever
magua pulls his knife and as he leans down towards munro
spin and flail furiously at each other with tomahawks and knives
the huron goes down and then the mohawk is shot
the huron who shot him is cut down by a ranger with tomahawk in one hand and bayonet in the other
two mohawks and three rangers fighting back to back
they become an island swamped by huron and ottawa amidst bodies and ground slippery with blood
as smoke obscures their image
in a group of civilian militia
two of the militiamen are shot down
the third engages a fox warrior
cora alice run
frozen in agony by shock
reaching down and up into something emerges and jams an object we barely see into the air
but his arm and shoulder and half his chest are splashed red with blood
seen from far away holding aloft the heart of munro
saw him and fights his way to attack when
crazed crashes through men knocking hawkeye over
protecting hawkeye slams his war club into one huron breaking his attack his arm and his skull and swings the other way burying the bladed end into the chest of
an ottawa whos behind him
up looking wildly
rd regiment of foot and heyward
they fire into our face
six paces back
rank two present
rank two hold
he grabs a partially loaded musket the ramrod still in the barrel
theyre taking fire
men are dying
theyre being pushed back
wearing a large cross attacks heyward from the side
one handed heyward fires the musket into the mans chest sending the ramrod through him
then heywards shot in the thigh and a thrown tomahawk hits him in the head and knocks him sideways
barely able to stand
he uses the musket as a cane and
rank two six paces back
rank one present
rank two did not retreat six paces
they stand in confusion
heyward looks to see whats wrong
are standing in water
theyre up against lake george
their backs are to the wall
on horseback try to intercede in the slaughter of five women
one french officer is shot by a huron
the other french officer runs through that huron and shoots the second
then his horse is shot out from under him and he goes down
pleads with an abnaki to give up a child hes holding by the legs in one hand
he offers his cross
the abnaki throws the baby to the jesuit pere roubaud
sees a flash of something yellow
so does hawkeye
they charge into the swirling chaos of attacking bodies
as we lose sight of them
on her hands and knees
a massive ottawa pulls her upright by her hair about to take her life and her scalp
hes struck by a rock in the hands of cora which barely phases him
he bats her aside and returns to alice when suddenly
is spun punched and tomahawked into the ground by hawkeye
uncas has alice and cora
from the earlier group are nearby
they combine with hawkeye to fight their way out with bayonets and tomahawks
back through the swirling smoke
there seems to be a lull
then theyre hit from the side by musket fire
one of the rangers is shot the other wounded
the mohawk supports the wounded ranger
shields cora as they back up
smashing his war club straight down on a huron reaches for the mans musket and shoots another
then he sees
its glass smooth
and the bows are barely visible of three or four huron war canoes
back into the water
theyre pursued by ottawa and hurons as they fight their way to the canoes
held up by hawkeye suddenly screams
something underwater is pulling her down
an ottawa brave rockets out of the shallows
before hes erect hawkeye slams him back into the water and fires
has shoved a large birch canoe at them
suddenly the mohawk fighting with them is shot and spins to face hawkeye
his hands rest on hawkeyes shoulders
hawkeye looks into his face
tries to hold him up tries to rescue him
a frozen moment
hawkeyes staring into his eyes and the man is staring into hawkeyes as the light goes out
hawkeye lets him slide into the water and float away
he moves cora and alice towards the canoe
the bottom of the frame is water like glass
smoke obscures the background
fingers tendril towards us
out of the mist we hear small splashing and then the high bow of a war canoe defines itself
its paddled towards us
coras behind hawkeye
alice and the wounded ranger are near uncas
cora looks left
her eyes go wide
have emerged from the smoke ten feet from them
heywards aiming a horse pistol at hawkeye
is non plussed
he doesnt stop paddling
you got nothin better to do today on lake george than shoot me major then go ahead
heywards a hairs breadth from firing
suddenly they hear the boom of muskets and rounds come in
theyre being pursued by three boatloads and then a fourth and fifth of huron
is indifferent to huron musket balls
hawkeye hasnt stopped paddling and pays heyward no heed
heyward comes to his senses
his head is gashed
a scarf as a tourniquet is tied around his leg
he lowers the gun
when you fall into british hands again nathaniel poe i will have you hanged
paddle hard and deep and the canoes power across the lake
with less paddlers plus wounded are slower and will be overtaken
looks to uncas
they both realize the same thing
hawkeye nods and he uncas chingachgook begin to paddle furiously
the others match the doubled pace
theyre sprinting ahead but the effort is exhausting
maintain their steady pace
three or four hurons fire
musket balls ricochet on the waters surface
one rips a hole through the bow
hawkeye sees one of the redcoats in heywards canoe is giving out
keep it up
he renews the attack on the water with the paddle
shouts how long
shouts only chance we got is
breathless to get more distance on em and go to ground
heyward digs in
like firecrackers in the distance huron muskets sound
a new hail of musket balls cut the fabric of the canoes
one redcoat is shot in the back
he falls overboard
looks over his shoulder
theyre pulling away from them
more huron musket balls hit water nearby
in heywards boat is shot
caliber ball didnt penetrate his skin
the redcoat amazed picks it off the floor of the canoe
distance caught up with eighteenth century ballistics
theyre out of smoothbore musket range
to heyward head for
for the white water
do you hear me sir
exhausted if you ever fall
into british hands
breathes what white water
divided by a spit of land
the right fork becomes a river with white water rapids
paddling now too as they furiously jam for the white water that will shoot them way ahead of the hurons
leaps off the stern of hawkeyes canoe and climbs up the stern of heywards and takes control
he roughly gestures to the redcoat and the major to stop paddling
he and hawkeye will pilot the two canoes
the canoes enter the white water and theyre so light theyre jet propelled
racing in the same direction they are
they hit it straight on and it shoots over them and theyre drenched by two waves coming from the sides
paddle like fiends to get momentum and control
when they crested the wave uncas hollers at them to pull and they do
as soon as theyre through it uncas slams the paddle in the water and makes the canoe revolve a hundred and eighty degrees in a vortex so that now its
going through stern first or the stern becomes the bow so that uncas could pilot it a different way through a hazard of
jutting out of the water
hawkeye didnt have to turn because chingachgook at the bow uses his paddle to shove the canoe away from jutting rocks
uncas does the same
past the jutting rocks uncas swings it back around while
smashes into the camera
as the canoe roller coasters and water bursts the bow
then suddenly its through and the water is miraculously smooth
the ranger the redcoats and even heyward feel the exhilaration of the ride
thats because they think theyre home free
heres where it gets tricky
heyward turns to look in front of him
he doesnt know what the hell hawkeyes talking about
looks glass smoth
although there is a distant roar of sorts
then heyward realizes somethings wrong with this picture
the look on his face starts to change
the glass surface of the river continues to a line then falls off the end of the world
the river just ends
realize theyre heading for the lip of a waterfall
theres a couple of outcroppings of rock in the center at the very edge
we are at glen falls
from the other side of the falls
its a two hundred foot high death defying cataract
the canoes slightly above us will go right over
at the last moment hawkeye uncas land both on either side of the larger rock outcropping
it is literally at the lip of the falls
grabs a rock to anchor the bow of the canoe
he loses his grip
the canoe rockets for the edge
lurches sideways grabs a tree root
he is the only link of the canoe to earth
the bow with heyward is literally hanging over the edge
uncas strains and pulls the canoe to the rock
he gestures to heyward
crawls forward and makes the island
then the two redcoats
the canoe rockets over the falls
hawkeye has beached his canoe and is camouflaging it with driftwood and brush
as they clamber over the high pieces of broken limestone we see hawkeye is slipping into a crevice
he motions to cora
uncas carries the wounded ranger
heyward helps alice
the irregular opening of medium blue sky is obscured by the black silhouetted forms of hawkeye cora and then the others entering
where do we go from here
i dont understand
this is it as far as we can go
if were lucky theyll be figurin we cant have come this way and mustve beached our canoes and headed cross land
if were very lucky theyll figure we went over the falls
then we take the south rim down the mountain and its miles cross country to fort edward
and if were unlucky
you will have to forego the pleasure of hangin me
hawkeye helps cora heyward the ranger
chingachgook carries alice down the rockface into a cave
we hear a distant roar reverberating off the walls
are scooped out bone like hollows eroded by tumbling water
at an earlier time the formation was part of the falls
reach the irregular floor of the chamber
the roar is louder
a curtain of falling water
theyre behind the cataract probably a third of the way down its height
light through the water stikes them with a silver luminescence
the others join them
they almost have to shout to be heard
followed by uncas takes stock of their supplies
they check their powder
they have almost none
uncas shares his with hawkeye
the redcoats cartridge case is soaked the paper cartridges a soggy mess
heyward has none
the ranger has two left
in mohican chingachgook decides some things
hawkeye and uncas nod
heyward approaches hawkeye
crossing to cora only one or two loads
is soaked to the bones
hawkeye strips off his buckskin hunting shirt and wrings it out
cora turns her back strips off her white blouse and puts on the faster drying chamois
are we safe
did you see my father
the look on his face tells it all tell me
hawkeye takes cora away from the group and turns her by her shoulders and whispers to her
we dont hear what he says
cora drops to her knees and places her hands over her eyes and face like a little girl trying to make something bad go away
leads her to a depression his arm around her shoulders her face covered and she cries softly into his shoulder
says into hawkeyes ear after she looks o
say nothing to alice
stands in the chamber not far from the wall of water fascinated with its shimmer
shes oblivious to all the events and everything going on around her
sees cora hawkeye together and turns away
uncas watches alice
the wounded ranger has fallen asleep
the redcoat is exhausted
hawkeye cora against the wall
a landscape with mist rearlit by the red light of the sun thats already behind the mountains
the blues are turning purple and the greens are turning black and the white highlights of the foaming water are going rose
reflecting the darkening sky where the surface isnt broken the water is fast moving metal
suddenly a shaved head and muscled back stands into the foreground
it moves down the shore away from camera
hes followed by other huron warriors
theyre two hundred yards away from glen falls island
looks at the island of rock trees and tilts his head curiously
watches the hurons below make their way towards the edge of the falls
join him moving frenetically uneasily
the leader of the pack looks up howls as his eyes go white reflecting the new moon
hears the distant howl
hes now lit silver blue by the moonlight through the falling water
hawkeye knows it means hurons are out there
he exchanges worried glances with uncas chingachgook
immediately starts up the right acclivity to one fissure and chingachgook moves carefully to the first fissure
his countenance gives way momentarily
all his experience seems of no avail
he touches the side of coras face
grabs killdeer and follows chingachgook
sensing new danger slips away on her own
crosses to the ranger whos semi conscious feverish and getting delirious
she cant do a thing except hold his hand and think of her father
below the edge listen wait testing the environment with all their senses
against one wall has his ear cocked monitoring facing away from the sky
looks at the sky through the fissure
she sees the starfields and feels silver moonlight pull her forward
she starts out onto the island oblivious unaware shell expose them
yanks her down next to him
he pulls her head into his chest looking out over the edge his tomahawk in front of him his musket near his right hand
there is no sign she was seen
he relaxes looks at her and puts his finger to his lips telling her to be silent
languorously she lies back closes her eyes and lays a hand on his shoulder palm up as if he were a prince in a romantic fantasy
uncas tries to restrain her
eyes slowly open
its replaced with escalating fear
she holds onto uncas with desperation
her fingers claw his shoulders
she buries her face in his chest
her body shudders
her terrors total
he tries to restrain and calm her
she wont let him
then her mouth seeks his and in the passion of despair and fear and wanting life she holds him between her thighs
and uncas is confused but alice whispers his name and he responds
he loves her in the half light
his hand buried in her hair irradiated by the moon then she seems to reach some emotional climax and begins to cry softly and uncas stops making love to her
and holds her
then shes flooded with shame
he reaches for her
she jerks away
he reaches for her again and clutches her to him
and she breaks down
then he turns her face to him but her expression has completely flattened
shes not a lover to uncas now
shes pitiful stricken and he comforts her
beaches a canoe on the bank
he and eight braves ease out
his war paint is fresh green handprints on his chest and black and green on his face
black plumes are affixed to his scalp lock and his shawl is over his left shoulder
the right arm carrying his musket is exposed
many scalps are tied to his tomahawk
he walks towards us approaching the island two hundred yards away
checks his powder horn
he looks at chingachgook
with the ranger looks up
the look on his face
theyve been discovered
now theyre backed into a hole in the ground with no powder and no way out
chingachgook talks to him in mohican
momentarily the anger and frustration is seen on hawkeyes face
all his experience craft has been to no avail
he looks at cora
back to chingachgook
chingachgook states something terse in mohican
he doesnt know what theyre talking about
cora has understood chingachgooks intent perfectly
explodes what the bloody hell plan is this
to cora in this there is a chance
if i live i can try to free you
if we dont go there is no powder theres too many of them
though my heart would keep me here in that there is no chance
i can do nothing
do you understand
i want you to go
coward back at the fort
hawkeye uses discipline not to kill the man
with all you have
to save yourself
if the worst happens and only one of us survives something of the other does too
then he inches above cover to see
of hurons approach to assault the island carrying torches
shes holding him
in the rigid language of her body is the struggle to contain her fear
very close if they dont kill you they may take you north up into canada
a warrior may take you for a wife
you hear me
you stay alive
i will find you
no matter how far how long it takes
nods low never doubt what you are doing
conscious now arranges his crushed body to face the direction from which will come the attack as
puts alice whos entered behind him as
uncas hits the floor of the cave
now the first glow from huron torches starts to light the walls
has their weapons slung over his back
he says something in mohican
uncas spins looks at alice her expressions vacant
cuts a lock of coras hair
he folds it into his shirt
the orange light from huron torches now closer plays on the wall behind her
we hear many huron approach
now run out of the cave and throw themselves into the curtain of water
this is their exit
engraves her image in his memory one last time and then sprints across the floor towards the water
and then through it into
an awful crushing roar
we explode out the front of a white cataract a third of the way from the top and we fall down away from the world
tumbles down the falls rolling tumbling through the white water then through air then back into cascading white water again disappearing
bodies hit disappear and dont surface
it looks unsurviveable
sheets of water fall with us
the bottom races towards us at a hundred miles an hour
just before we hit
the cave is filled with hurons
the redcoat is dead in the corner
a group of braves moves away from the body of the ranger
the women are behind him
he slashes at one huron with his sword and is clubbed down by a giant
his blanket like a shawl over his left shoulder black plumes in his hair
reaches out and touches coras hair
cora is frozen to the spot
his hand drops away from the hated munros and as magua turns to go he says something low in huron and the two women are jerked towards the fissures
heyward is dragged by the arms
miles from the falls
we see a figure
its chingachgook nearly spent rolling and tumbling through the fast moving white water
he submerges then surfaces again
he appears exhausted by the fall and ride
rocketing at us battering and drowning us
we glimpse something downstream
tries to focus slammed against rocks hes striking out towards the right swimming against the current
hes grabbing for something
and leather shoulder strap
chingachgooks hand grabs it
the current rushing past tries to steal him from uncas and hawkeye whore also beaten bloodied exhausted
they pull the older larger man from the water and
all three lie there almost devoid of energy
then hawkeye rises looks at the others
then uncas and theyre moving off into the calm eddy between the rock they landed on and the shoreline
move along animal paths
struggle through the branches of trees
no one helps them
when they fall behind they are pushed forward
badly beaten bound staggers ahead to get behind maqua
then if magua give women to yengeese soldiers will receive many gifts
as if considering gifts
three four oxen
does yengeese major have property across salt sea
yengeese major give all property to magua
magua give yengeese major much wampum many gifts maybe three four oxen
magua looks at heyward derisively
does this white man think hes an idiot
gold could be arranged
for munro children
how much gold has the master of the yengeese
the king has mountains of gold
long pause as if magua and king george ii were seriously considering this transaction
heyward is first realizing with whom hes playing
what is enough
give magua new heart
magua totally disdains the englishman and walks away from him starting up a steeper forested hill
running cross country after the huron column
they leap over fallen logs and keep going
breathing hard his lips are drawn back sweat stains his buckskins
then sees something
where cora alice were struggling up the animal path
as they race across a stream away from us after the war party and into the night
supporting alice is dragged forward by a huron warrior by a woven rawhide thong tied to her neck
move quickly down into a ravine
is shoved forward
long loping strides
cover ground like long distance runners
no noise except their hard even breathing
theyre moving down a clear trail
out on the flank
lips are drawn back determined flashing through the hard verticals of the forest now leaps down an embankment into the soft loam and keeps going
on a rude platform
the entire village is crowded in a large circle
they all wait for someone
theyve been waiting a long time
in the perimeter warriors keep huron at bay for some reason
we see magua
he stands apart
is led to the dais by three women down the main street between the neat rows of birch bark lodges
many scalps and trophies from the massacre are in evidence
he sits on the raised platform
he looks to be in his nineties
his dark wrinkled face is contrasted by his long white hair
his robe is painted in hieroglyphical representation of combat
he wears numerous silver gold medals gifts of french english and dutch governors
most startling is his face
his dark lined skin is enhanced by delicate lines of tatooing
he looks up to magua
in huron subtitled the tomahawks of your young men have been very red
in huron subtitled many of the yengeese are dead great sachem
sound dissolve to english i have brought three of my prisoners to honor you
two are the children of munro
whose scalp hangs on my lodge pole
and whose heart i cut from his chest
now we see cora on the ground
defeat fear are held in place by her determination
alice looks around in another place
heywards hands are bound between his back with a piece of wood wedged through his elbows
then uncas drops and the other two follow
seen in the distance through the sparse trees
they have dropped at the very periphery of the forest where the woods end
the lay of the land is important for action that follows the village is built in a meadow
to the left is a cliff face that rises to a rocky promontory
on the right is a path that winds up to the promontory and beyond across the mountains
in the center outside the largest lodge
slams the earth with his fists
they didnt intercept them in time
difficult odds just became impossible
the earth was pale
our tomahawks were bright
now they are dull from war
and the huron rich with the trophies of honor
magua will sell the english officer to les francais and the reward is my gift to you wise one
the women children of the white war chief will burn in our fires so all can share in this
the sachem considers this
then he looks up and sees something beyond magua
senses the sachems eye line
unarmed walking through the hurons
a young boy rushes at him
hawkeye at the last possible second dodges
others catch and restrain the boy
the hurons are astounded a european would simply walk into their camp
sees him enter doesnt believe hes there
hawkeye glances at her doesnt respond
the situation is a stick of dynamite ready to go off
to heyward low translate for me major
as i say it
magua starts towards hawkeye his tomahawk slipping into his hand
to sachem i come to you unarmed and in peace to unstop your ears wise one
because the hurons are mislead by the words of the wolf whos never spoken the truth
sachem gestures with his hand to magua
magua reluctantly stops advancing on hawkeye
heywards french translation has faded to a murmur
we hear hawkeyes english
let the children of the dead colonel munro go free and take the fire out of the english anger over the murder of their helpless ones
to sachem our father montcalm is greater than the yengeese in the arts of war
the huron do not fear english anger
to sachem wise one the french fathers made peace and swore to their honor not to break the friendship
magua broke it
it is false that the french would not be friends still to the huron
laughs it made our french father happy to never have to fight the same yengeese again
he told me this without telling me this
hawkeye realizes this is true
so the huron are the servants of the french
to do what the french are shamed to do
to sachem huron serve no one
the french father believes he fooled magua because he is so proud of his cleverness he is blind
but it is the huron path that magua walks down not the french one
now les francais also fear huron
that is good
when the huron is strong from their fear we will make the terms of trade with les francais
and we will trade as the white man trades
take land from the abnakes fur from the osage sauk fox
and make the huron great
over other tribes
no less than the whites as strong as the whites
hawkeye appears to be losing his debate with magua
to sachem magua would use the ways of les francais and the yengeese
to sachem the red man put down the bow picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest
it is the only way
would the huron make his algonquin brothers foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the white man
would the huron have greed for more land than a man can use
like francais black robes do
would huron kill tribes with disease
would the huron fool seneca into taking all the animals in the forest for beads brandy
but sell the fur to the white man for gold
to sachem those are the ways of yengeese and les francais masters
are they the ways of huron men who hunt work the land
or of dogs
maguas heart is twisted
he would make himself into what twisted him
a dog become master of dogs
but are hurons dogs
maguas way is false
it is like the white sickness
maguas way will bring only sadness and shame
is there another way
i dont know
pauses i am nathaniel of the yengeese hawkeye adopted son of chingachgook of the mohican people
let the children of the dead munro go free
i speak the truth
magua starts to rebut
sachem holds up his hand and stops him
sachem whispers to the older men on either side of him
waits for the decision
looks to alice then to hawkeye
exchanges a desperate look with cora and then senses the sachem is staring at him from the perspective of nearly a century of laws judgments
to every word
the white man comes like a day that has passed
and night enters our future with him
pause our council talks since i was a boy what is the huron to do
pause but magua would lead huron down paths that make us not hurons
the judgment dark girl burn in fire to heal the twisted heart of magua
cora hearing the sentence
hawkeyes losing her
continuing munro daughter with moon in her hair must be maguas wife so munros seed doesnt die
alice is gone living in some dark recess of her mind
continuing dissolves back to french and yengeese officer not go to les francais but back to yengeese so their hatred burns less bright
la longue carabine go in peace
people move start to implement the sentence
cora is jerked upright
she looks at hawkeye in terror sachem is starting to depart
to heyward tell him ill trade him
me for her
heyward translates into rapid fire french
shouts i am la longue carabine
my death is a great honor to the huron
cora is jerked forward by three hurons
magua grabs alice
cora strikes at magua
he knocks her aside
meanwhile french subtitled this is not the voice of wisdom
i go to the hurons of the lakes
you are women
send your arrows and guns to the seneca beg from them venison to eat corn to grind
slaves dogs rabbits thieves
i spit on you
those hurons who hear do so in deadly boding silence
magua and his fourteen hard core braves start out as
heard heywards translation
he looks at heyward then looks at hawkeye and he nods his head
his eyes go to cora
theyve stopped dragging her towards the fire pit
hawkeye steps forward to surrender
cora is thrown at him
cora looks around wildly
instead of taking hawkeye two warriors grab heyward
is immediately hamstrung and his legs collapse
hes caught under the arms and dragged forward
i said to trade me
hawkeyes holding cora
heyward struggles to be seen
pause take her and get out
standing what are they doing to duncan
they start to ease away from the mass of hurons
low to himself and my compliments to you
hawkeyes concentration is on backing out of the huron mob
will the sachems judgment be honored
will some warriors hack down hawkeye cora
as they go
moves towards her sister
but hawkeye holds her tightly as they retreat
with maguas group crosses the path
he drags alice behind him like baggage
she regains her feet
magua is oblivious to her
hes heading towards the plateau
uncas sees maguas direction
uncas touches his father grabs his musket and races off
chingachgook reaches to stop him but hes too late
chingachgooks hand in the air
near the tree line
hawkeye has eyes only for
moving towards fire pit
one turns to watch hawkeye cora depart
will he arouse others to attack
behind him others are doing something to heyward and flames leap up
are on alice off to the right in the meadow
theyre almost there
suddenly heywards stood upright into the fire bound to a bracket by his arms
as the flames start devouring him
close to chingachgook and the tree line
tosses hawkeye killdeer
as fast as he jams it into his shoulder he fires
among the hollering hurons is shot dead
it goes unnoticed
half way up the rock face
hes approaching an overhang
he climbs with a reckless desperation
pound across the sic to the meadow towards maguas path
trying to stay with them scrambles up
reaches the overhang
it juts away from the face six feet
uncas hand jams into a crack in the granite forms a fist and twists making a wedge
he swings out dangling in space by the hand wedged into the rock
his right hand reaches out and up searching the vertical face for
a rock flake
his fingers find a diagonal crevice and
swings out now hanging by the vertical face above the overhang
his features are distorted with determination
nothing will stop him
his right hand grabs another rock
his arms snap him up
hes on the ledge
on point are approaching the path above the promontory
five warriors are ahead of magua
one behind him drags alice
huron starts up the narrow path
slams him off the rock with the butt of his musket
twos musket coming up
before hes fallen uncas bayonets three
fires misses swings
uncas slips the swung musket but it catches his elbow
uncas musket falls
before it hits the ground his tomahawk is out and hacks four over the edge
running forward past five confronts uncas head on
its incredibly fast
three tomahawk swings are dodged by magua whose own knife streaks like silver flashes
uncas gashed on arms and chest feints right and slams magua with an open hand closes and the men are intertwined steel and muscle
and magua throws uncas
going with him and rolling off uncas maguas knife flashes into his armpit
uncas right arm is useless
he scrambles up
next to the expertise of a mature warrior like magua uncas raw young determination may not be enough
magua moves inside stabs uncas twice turns him to face the edge ripping his head left to expose the right underside of his throat
knife arm punches forward
uncas falls down the face onto to the rocks
seeing his boy killed cries out and is charging up the path hawkeye following
backs to the edge
moves on alice
his knife is low about to strike
she stares at him
her eyes are like pools of deep water calm open almost beatific
it stops magua
inexplicably drops his knife hand
hes riveted by her
about him theres a glimmer of something else
he wears a human face for this one moment
he reaches out with his other hand to offer her safety
to bring her back from the edge
looks down at uncas her lover dead on the rocks below
she turns to magua with enigmatic calm
her eyes seem to see into him
she steps off the edge
she falls to her death next to uncas
collapses to her knees on the ground and her face falls forward into her hands
are running down the path to intercept chingachgook charging uphill fueled by a fathers rage and hawkeye
one huron aims at the center of chingachgooks chest
fires past his fathers side
the hurons blown off the path
hawkeye races to reload on the run
sees the approach of chingachgook
huron warriors are an irrelevance
he slams one aside with his musket
with tomahawk about to blindside chingachgook is shot down
two men like dots race to collide at the center of the promontory
now the others fall back
its one on one
magua confident pumped up feints with his left his tomahawk appearing in his right sweeping backhand while his left magically holding his blade is jamming up to gut chingachgook
he rolled and on one knee with his back to magua his arm slams rearward
the massive war club crashes into maguas back
stunned turns to hatchet chingachgook
now up and towering slams his club right into maguas assault
destroying it breaking maguas right arm
with his momentum spins like a shot putter and the next blow cripples maguas left side and crushes part of his chest
destroys maguas collar and shoulder
his body is broken and crippled but he still stands
he looks into the eyes of the last warrior of the mohicans
and he spins and swings
the blade side of the war club punches into maguas chest caving him in two
magua dies in the dust
watching chingachgooks heaving back
alone kneeling in the meadow
her eyes downcast
chingachgooks at the edge facing the endless rolling forests to the west
a haze of sunlight illuminates silver and lead clouds
hawkeye is a little apart watching his father
speaks to the sky
mohican great spirit and the maker of all life
we hear hawkeyes english translation in voice over in english a warrior goes to you swift and straight as an arrow shot into the sun
welcome him and let him take his place at the council fire of my people
pause he is uncas my son
pause bid them patience and ask death for speed for they are all there but one i chingachgook last of the mohicans
chingachgooks hands drop to his sides
he lets out his breath with a weariness
his eyes seek hawkeyes
is standing her back to us in front of a rock covered grave with a wooden cross
next to it is uncas burial platform
cora says a silent prayer
then she pauses crosses herself
her emotions are spent
she moves next to hawkeye
he takes her hand
will you go back to england
i have nothing to go back for
then will you stay in america
she turns to face him
and will you be my wife
they hold each others eyes
she searches his face
where will we go
winter with the delaware my fathers cousins
and in the spring cross the ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called can tuck ee
they move next to chingachgook
he senses theyre beside him
hawkeyes arm is around her shoulders
the frontier moves with the sun and pushes the red man of the wilderness forests in front of it
until one day there will be nowhere left
then our race will be no more or be not us
the frontier place is for people like my white son and his woman and their children
thats my fathers sadness talking
hawkeye puts a hand on his shoulder
it is true
there will be no more frontier
then men like you will go too
like the mohicans
pause and new people will come
struggle to make their light
one mystery remains
what is that
cora listening to chingachgook takes hawkeyes hand
will there be anything left to show the world that we ever did exist
cora stands next to her man
hawkeye puts his arm around his father
they stare out over the wilderness
