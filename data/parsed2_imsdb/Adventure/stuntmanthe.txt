written by lawrence b
marcus adaptation by richard rush from the novel by paul brodeur a strip of two lane highway runs through a tall pine forest
there is a truck stop coffee shop beside the roadway
a few wheelers are scattered across the big dusty parking lot
morning sunlight glints off their chrome stacks
it bakes the asphalt and warms the mangy hides of stray dogs asleep in the dirt
a helicopter hovers about the treetops like a lazy hummingbird
its the beginning of a perfect day
a highway patrol car slowly trolls among the trucks and dogs and parks beside the slat and shingled building
two telephone linemen are scaling a power pole at the forests edge
high on the pole the linemen lean back against their safety straps to work their bodies forming a y
one of them suddenly turns pointing at a nearby treetop
he grabs a porcelain insulator from his belt cocks his arm and hurls it across the open stretch
it lands smack in the middle of the tree
a rattle of leaves a rustle of feathers and a huge buzzard comes flapping out
the lineman cackles over his marksmanship
the big frightened beady eyed bird is lumbering through the sky flapping for its life and suddenly
it crashes head on into a the bubble of the passing helicopter
the ship rocks as the pilot wrestles the controls
there are three others in the cabin
the man beside the pilot eli cross is sketching in a manuscript and eating an apple
he glances up in irritation
hey will you stop wiggling
dont yell at me
yell at the goddamn crazy bird
it tried to kill us
back to his manuscript oh yeah thats your story
whats the bird got to say about it
eli bites into his apple grimacing at the mushy mouthful he tosses it out the hatch
the apple drops into the trees bounces down from branch to branch and falls on the slanted roof of the roadside diner beneath
it rolls down the eaves off the edge and lands on top of the parked highway patrol car
something hit the roof
so will the chief
if we dont grab this guy cameron
they climb out as we see a second patrol car sliding up behind them
more policemen emerge from the second car
they huddle then move toward the diner entrance
as they pass an open window the camera holds
a fry cook serves behind the long counter where men on stools eat watching the overhead tv
there is a pinball machine in action
the policemen are seen entering b
a truck driver ambles up and straddles a stool
gettin hot early
its gonna be a scorcher
the fry cook fills the drivers empty water glass from a pitcher then move down the counter
he sits a few stools away
hes about even featured bone weary
his appealing face needs a shave
the cook fills his water glass
the ice cubes rattle as camerons hand trembles
his eyes are riveted on the policemen
two policemen take seats at a booth across from the counter one policeman moves to a wall telephone another stands near the cash register looking at a magazine
they seem nonchalant but are placed to block all avenues of escape
suddenly startled as someone slaps him on the arm
he whirls to face the man beside him
thats really a beaut
really a beaut
the man is staring at the tatoo which shows below the rolled up sleeve of camerons shirt a large american eagle with elaborate scrollwork and a patriotic slogan
the man pulls up his own sleeve to show a small tatoo of an anchor
my wife still yells about this
but yours thats some eagle
like a billboard
eyes on police yeah thats the grand old bird
a half smile right now i just wish the son of a bitch could fly
cameron rises and moves across the diner to the pinball machine
the player wiggles and contorts using body english to influence the balls
hey morton you think your ass is connected to the machine
you wiggle its gonna make the ball go where you want
a camerons eyes scan the room passing the tv above the counter
on it the commercial shows a beautiful girl who well later know as nina franklin bending over a bowl of dog food
her ass too b wiggles engagingly
the pinball player leaves the machine
cameron stalling for time works the plunger while a cop stalks closer like the cat to the mouse hole
hey youre lucky
somebody left a free ball
the ball bounces crazily inside the machine lights and buzzers flashing
another policeman approaches
youre gonna win
a free game
he rests his hands on the machine glancing about
escape seems hopeless
thats just what i needed
one more chance to lose
in a lightning swift motion the cop clamps his hands down over camerons wrists snapping the handcuffs on
the trap has sprung
cameron nods his head in resignation
a big uncontrollable grin breaks and spreads over the cops face
then suddenly cameron bolts desperately springing full speed for the back door
he flings it open
the cops are moving toward him
one has almost got his gun out
cameron lunges through the doorway not realizing in his frenzy the screen door still blocks his path
he tears through it but gets stuck halfway
god dont shoot
swinging his manacled arms like a club against the tangled mesh he breaks free and runs
as cameron flies down the back steps a cop stationed at the rear door caught off guard tries to stop him but is shoved flat on his back
cameron weaves and scrambles across the yard over fences between the shed and the barn rolling beneath a building out the other side
behind him distant shouts and a gunshot
as cameron runs he moves with a skill that suggests forests are not alien to him
he crouches low following tiny avenues in the maze of tree trunks scrambling on all fours over needles and fallen cones
sweat pours down his face
his breath rasps in his throat
he breaks into a clearing and freezes
suddenly face to face with a man who crouches blocking his path
it is one of the telephone linemen we saw earlier
the lineman kneeling at his tool chest is surprised by cameron
the other lineman is halfway up the power pole
they both stare at camerons handcuffs
cameron edges back his escape route blocked
the man on the ground grabs a wrench and moves forward with the same gleam in his eye we saw when he scared that bird from the tree
stand right there like a good old boy and do what i say
you wanna try and mess with me youve had fair warning
i was a combat marine in korea
the lineman advances on him as cameron backs away
no shit so was my old man
he suddenly stamps his foot and shrieks aaaaaaaargh
the lineman jumps in surprise
then enraged like a startled bull he lunges forward with the wrench
cameron uses the mans weight against him his moves those of a trained fighter
a hard knee to his stomach doubles up the lineman
the handcuffed arms slam down like a club between his shoulder blades driving him to the ground
a kick thrown sideways to his head and the man is out
the other lineman who had started to descend the pole freezes and takes one step back up
cameron grabs the linemans toolbox in his handcuffed grasp and dashes off into the forest
he slides down a slope on a carpet of fallen leaves tumbling to the bottom and falls face forward into a running stream where he holds his head and drinks
camera moves across the terrain
there are no pursuers the forest is silent
the jaws of a wire cutter clamp down severing the chain connecting the cuffs around camerons wrists
he lifts his knee from the cutter handle
his arms are now free
he wedges a chisel against one bracelet and swings a sledgehammer against it
we hear his sharp outcry
doubled up holding his wrist in pain
the bracelet is still intact
he buttons his shirt cuffs over the metal bands and climbs the slope to the bright sunlight on the road above
cameron is trudging along the old road winding down through the mountainous pass
he crosses a bridge
through the arches of its low stone railing he sees a black river twenty feet below rushing toward the sea
then glancing back he is suddenly alert
in the far distance almost lost in the shimmering heat waves from the road is a tiny speck moving toward him
he clambers down the embankment behind the railing peering out from this hidden vantage
the speck grows larger
the sound of the engine is faintly audible now
sunlight flashes from metal and glass
camerons apprehension suddenly changes to wonderment for the vehicle is not the police as he had feared but something else
moving in the shimmering heat wave is a splendid high humpbacked world war i vintage duesenberg sedan with gleaming brass headlights roaring towards him
he scrambles up the embankment to thumb a ride
the duesenberg roars past him filling his eyes and mouth with dust
suddenly there is a screech of brakes
the duesenberg goes into a skid and then bounces to a stop
running cameron reaches the car pulls the front door open and climbs in beside the driver
i thought you didnt see me
the driver burt is a husky red haired man about camerons age and deeply agitated
pounding his fist against the steering wheel he talks half to cameron half to himself
screwed it up
lost my nerve
fishing a vicks inhaler from his pocket and shoving it in his nostril
cant even see straight
cameron looks at him puzzled
you want me to drive
burt whirls on him enraged
what the hell is that supposed to mean
confused no offense
thought you might
every one of you jerks is a goddamn hotshot expert
thanks for the vote of confidence
if you think you can do any better just come and try it
he puts his boot in camerons stomach and shoves hard
cameron comes flying out and lands on his back in the road as the duesenberg squeals forward its open door slamming shut from the momentum
stunned the wind knocked out of him cameron rises to his elbows
before the old relic has gone thirty yards again the brakes screech swinging the car into a sliding salute turn one hundred eighty degrees and it is suddenly screaming back
driving with one hand on the door handle his head halfway out the window watching the bridge railing and the water beyond
cameron sprawled on the road is momentarily paralyzed at the sight of the duesenbergs great brass grill bearing down
his hand closes over a rock and with the same illogical gesture that a soldier flings a coke bottle at a tank cameron hurls the rock in the direction of
the car and frantically rolls sideways
the big spinning tires brush him as they pass
we catch a momentary glimpse of the rock smashing against the gleam of the passing windshield
as he stops rolling once more face down in the dust eyes closed expecting death he becomes aware there is only silence
he opens his eyes climbs to his feet
the road is empty
the duesenberg is gone
astonished confused he walks to the side of the bridge where the railing ends and the car might have plunged off
there is nothing below but the rushing black water
here and there bubbles swirl to the surface
they could be from a sinking car or could be caused by the current
his thoughts racing
was it the sun has he imagined the whole thing
suddenly a helicopter appears hovering almost at eye level
sunlight flashes through the spinning blades like a strobe
it is the same helicopter we saw in the opening sequence
it has swiftly descended beside the bridge just beyond the railing catching cameron with no chance to run or hide
four men can be seen inside the plastic cockpit barely a few feet away
the man beside the pilot is eli cross
he grabs the radio microphone and begins speaking into it
cameron whirls scrambles down a bank to a field
the helicopter drops to within a few feet of the water hovers
protected from sight cameron runs between the tall stalks away from the road
glancing back through the stalks as he runs cameron sees a stake truck barreling toward the sight of the accident
in the back three men are frantically putting on black wet suits
they look from this distance like little black toys tumbling against each other
cameron runs on
a few hotels like a cluster of old victorian gingerbread surround a sandy cove beyond which is the sea
there is a fishing pier boardwalk hot dog stands pizza parlors all swarming with sunbathing tourists
the towns bucolic turn of the century charm might even survive these if not for a monstrous yellow construction crane which juts ten stories into the sky from the center
of the sandy cove
cameron appears on the bluff
surveying the town expressionless a jungle beast going to survive no matter what at least for a few more hours
he reaches down and rips off his trouser legs at the thigh turning them into cutoffs a vacationing bather might wear
he pulls off his worn boots and flings them into the brush his eyes never leaving the town below
there are crowds to get lost in down there
he unbuttons his sleeve and looks at the handcuff still encircling his wrist
stopping beside a large rock he smashes the bracelet against it
it wont open
grimacing in pain he re buttons the sleeve opens his shirt and begins descending the palisades toward the town
the screen is yellow and on it are the words have a nice day
the angle widens and we realize the words are on the back of a yellow hat that jiggles as its wearer walks
it is cameron
beyond him we see the tide of tourists in oils and ointments flirting with the sun
teenage girls at portable toilets adjusting their bikinis
the boardwalk cops in white shirts looking like ice cream vendors whom cameron deftly avoids
then he looks up at the sky perplexed the helicopter from the bridge is overhead circling
cameron watches it warily as he walks
a big crowd has formed at the railing of the pier
many of the people with cameras clicking at the sand below
cameron notices the helicopter is now sharing the sky with a brightly painted open cockpit biplane
it is a world war i fighter with british insignia
cameron works his way through the crowd
all eyes now look upward at the plane
a loud voice is heard coming through an electric all right people
were losing the sun
this is a take
youre welcome to watch but please no flashbulbs
theyll spoil the shot
camerons world has become more ordered again
its a film company shooting on location this somehow must explain the duesenberg
his eyes go to the scene below
a camera rig suspended from the end of the yellow construction crane is photographing the surf where extras in german wwi uniforms unload ashore
the bright little plane has started a lazy dive toward the soldiers its engine whining
from here it looks as fearsome as snoopy and the red baron
as the british plane pulls out of the dive there is a tremendous explosion
in the flash of smoke and flame barge rowboats ammunition and people are blown sky high
the smoke from the exploding ammunition momentarily obscures the scene
the onlookers are very impressed and pleased and then abruptly their pleasure turns to horror and disbelief
as the smoke lifts the tom and jerry violence has become a horrifying reality
bodies are scattered about
one man has been severed in half drenched in blood
chunks of meat arms and legs litter the beach
paralyzed by the sense of catastrophe
shouting something went wrong
then people begin to moan and scream
staring tensely at the carnage
by reflex a shout escapes his lips
get the medics
a a woman sags into a faint
a small child in the crowd is crying and clutching camerons leg
as the scene continues we hear a voice on the bullhorn
i said cut
thats a print
suddenly the reality of the horror turns into an obscene absurd farce as what appear to be the missing parts of bodies begin wriggling out of the sand where the
extras were partially buried to create the macabre effect and now the extras become whole human beings before our eyes once again
the crowd reacts in various ways
sighs of relief laughter anger
the exhumed extras wipe sand from their eyes and shake it down their trouser legs
yelling beautiful harvey
you gave everybody a heart attack
harvey the second unit director yells back
eli will hate it
he said he wanted the shot in one
now watch hell do six hours of pick ups
the crowd disperses
a tourist turns to cameron
but why do they always use so much blood
it ruins the realism dont you think
still shaken quietly mutters asshole
the tourist stiffens as cameron turns away his attention now drawn by the beating sound of the helicopter
he glances up
the helicopter is descending toward the beach while the film crew rapidly moves equipment from the last scene into piles to clear a landing site
wary of the men in the chopper cameron is moving down the pier away from the landing site
suddenly he stops short caught by something he sees o
excitedly he points and begins to shout
below him walking away on the sand is one of the actors with the same red hair the same old british army jacket as burt the man in the duesenberg
hearing the shout the actor stops and tentatively turns
its a mistake
clearly the features are different
its not burt
cameron is puzzled
he watches as the red haired actor looks about to see who called and finding no one starts off but is stopped by a little old lady holding a parasol
and offering her autograph book
arent you raymond bailey the actor
would you please sign your autograph
write to emily
for eternal peace
raymond signs the book with the easy charm of a man whos done it a million times
he has those special rugged good looks that belong to marlboro men and movie stars
im certainly glad youre all right
i lost my husband and my son in the wars
the sound of the chopper blades has become deafening as it hovers for a landing
the old lady snatches her autograph book and heads for the landing site
as it touches the ground and its doors fly open
out step the crewmen and eli cross
the assistant director rushes up and shouts over the hissing blades of the idling chopper
what happened on the bridge
deeply upset all the divers found in the car was the goddamn camera
stunned and burt
anguished no burt
caught in the current probably and
theyre diving downstream and searching the riverbanks but
dont say anything to the crew yet
softly jesus christ
yeah jesus christ
what do you want to do
i dont know
call my mother and have her tell me it wasnt my fault
desperately what the hell could have happened
their words are lost in the sound of the rotor as the chopper slowly rises
the sudden wind from its blades blows some screening off a pile of equipment
it falls on the little old lady who has been approaching eli and topples her into the surf
she is trapped in a tangle of ancient skirts and petticoats
before she can regain her balance a wave tumbles her further into the sea
cameron sitting on the edge of the pier over the water has watched this mini disaster
the undertow from the wave has swept the old lady directly beneath him
reaching down toward her he yells hey
hey give me your hand
he cant quite reach her
as a last resort he drops off the edge into the water by her side
he grabs for the struggling old lady
dont be afraid
youre gonna be okay
like groping through seaweed he reaches past her tangled skirts grasps her waist and lifts her to keep her head above water
she is choking gasping for air
she turns her face toward him
her features are distorted they seem to be melting away
she frees her hand and violently tears at her face pulling away the rubber mask on which is the melting putty and make up
with it goes her wig and what is left is a startlingly beautiful young girl
choking on water youre
i know you
that girl from tv
the sun glistens on the wet wild young perfection of her face ingenuously sparkling laughter and for an instant its breathtaking a universal boyhood fantasy to suddenly be thrown this
close to that kind of movie star beauty
its something cameron feels in the pit of his stomach
why the hell
laughing and choking makeup test
its for the film
regaining his composure enough to attempt flattery but he means it
they gotta be crazy to cover that face
laughing im only old at the end of the story
as they are only in a few feet of water there is no longer any reason to hold her
he starts to put her down
no dont do that
in three feet of water
oh come on please
i always wanted someone to rescue me from something
grinning he carries her toward shore
eli surrounded by the crew and dozens of tourists is standing at the waters edge as cameron wades in and sets nina down
you damned near scared me to death
at the sight of eli she becomes like a little girl who having skinned her knee and run to daddy now can allow herself to cry
oh hell its all ruined now and i wanted you to see the makeup eli
where were you
i even got raymonds autograph and he didnt know
youd have been proud
nina is surrounded by people who are rubbing her with towels taking pictures all shouting at once
the crowd closes in excluding cameron to the outskirts
to the a
get her into a tub then bed
and i want to see her in makeup and costume again before dinner
three crewmen hustle her off as she searches the crowd for cameron
then spots him
that was really gallant
rescuing an old lady
cameron waves and starts to wander off as they whisk nina away
he moves toward cameron
wait a second
i want to thank you too
as eli trots up cameron tenses finally facing this man who saw him from the helicopter
dont run away
what is that a habit with you
yeah i also smoke too much
you and burt on the bridge
how about telling me what happened
eli begins to stroll along the sand toward the pilings which support the pier
cameron hesitates but elis manner compels him to follow
i dont know
he mustve gone crazy
he tried to run me down
why would he do that
flustered i didnt ask him why
all i know is he was comin at me very fast
quoting an axiom spouted by top sergeants in a thousand boot camps you want to get home for thanksgiving you better figure the guy comin at you is tryin to
thats one thing i learned from the gooks
that has a nostalgic ring
they have reached the pier
eli stops he is watching something you guys really used to call them gooks
i thought that was just time magazine
that was nam
what should i call em wops
nobodyd known what i was talkin about
he turns to follow elis gaze
a police car has driven onto the beach
from it three officers have emerged
they are armed and efficient looking
the production manager moves to greet them
eli takes camerons wrist and gently pulls him back into the shadow of the pilings privately reacting to the handcuff he feels beneath the shirt
jake the chief is irate enough to be clearly heard from this distance
all right this time youve had it
where is he
chief im glad you dropped by
eli says you gotta do something about all these people on the beach
bellowing thirty minutes is what youve got to get your goddamn equipment off this beach and out of town
you tell eli cross if your men are on the streets after four oclock ill throw their ass in jail
eli squats down on his heels and leans back against a piling smiling up at cameron
speaking of jail
would you get upset if i asked how many cops were after you
suddenly grim what are ya talkin about
off hand your i
the look on your face
the way you ran from the bridge
with exaggerated delicacy i
dont suppose you want to tell me what you did
cameron studies eli not knowing what to make of him
brightly with humor could i try categories
cameron half laughs despite himself
ever done any stunt work
howd you like to be a stunt man
you look like youre in pretty good shape fast on your feet
you could do it
getting to his feet besides youre not gonna have much choice
jake has spotted them and is approaching with his men and the production manager
eli puts his hand on camerons shoulder and steps out into the sunlight
softly to cameron now dont get hasty
and remember your ass its just like mine
maybe i can save them both
trailing after jake but weve gotta have three days to finish this picture
striding toward eli you said youd be gone four days ago before the season started
you lie break promises
he is now close enough and shouting at eli cross ive gone out of my way but this time
a tram beeps clangs and passes between them interrupting jake and leaving him sputtering
as it departs eli seizes the moment
jake its been a rotten morning
youre hot and tired
lets go in have us a drink and find out whats eating you
turning beet red dont treat me like these other morons
you know goddamn well whats eating me is that duesenberg on the bottom of the river with the dead man in it
there is silence
eli stands thoughtfully kicking the sand with his toe
then jake starts shouting again
i mean that is a goddamn public bridge and a public river
you go there without permits without any precautions and get a man killed
no more bullshit explanations
before i figure out how to hang you with a manslaughter charge
after a pause quietly no explanations
dont have any
but maybe he does
staring at cameron go ahead ask him jake
elis words are exploding in camerons mind that illusory event on the bridge has crystallized into hard reality
wide eyed now wait
youre not blaming me for
wheeling on cameron why not burt
because youre a fake
because youre just a goddamn daredevil with a head full of marbles
cameron vaguely understands that eli is trying to pass him off as burt and that he somehow may be saved by going along with this madness
eli turning to jake continues passionately
he grabs the bread blows the shot screws you up
screws me up
hes dumb jake but thank god he aint dead yet
so do me a favor put your handcuffs on this son of a bitch and put him some place where he cant get hurt
the chief is dazed
if this is burt the stunt man he is obviously alive
jake goes to cameron
how did you get out of the car
he didnt get out
our divers got him out
and brought him back in the chopper
the chief stares at cameron
his clothes and hair are wet
there is a small bruise on his cheek from when he fell out of the duesenberg
he looks the part
jake turns to eli with resignation
cross when these three days are up im going to arm my men with shotguns and tell them its open season on any fruit carrying a camera
he walks to the waiting police car surrounded by tourists snapping pictures
he glares at them angry at the world
eli puts his arm on camerons shoulder and leads him through the dispersing crowd toward the hotel
eli is now easygoing and friendly
you did that very well
i didnt get a chance to say a word
i just listened
there are only a few actors in the world who have mastered that art
anyway it was a good audition
you landed the part
what about the crew
they going to look at me and say hi burt
unless you prefer hi elizabeth
dont worry about my crew theyll call you anything i want em to
look im not being callous
burt is a fucking tragedy but theres nothing in the world i can do about it
ive gotta have this location for three more days
and you need a place to hide
they have reached the steps of the hotel
a bus has stopped in front
tourists are piling out
the police car pulls up and parks nearby
jake and his men can be seen surveying the crowd
shouting in b
the crews waiting
we need the next setup
close up of the hand
be there in a minute
an eli minute or a real minute
eli turns back to cameron as they mount the steps
by tomorrow the local copsll know what i look like
i cant hang around
expansively burt stop worrying
havent you heard of movie magic
pointing to the etched glass doors of the hotel that door is the looking glass and inside
youre gonna pose as a stunt man whos posing as an actor whos posing as a character in a movie
whos posing as an enemy soldier
in that big a crowd whos gonna notice you
people like to believe in things and cops are just people
the have reached the front door
eli holds it open for cameron
with mock confidentiality frankly your problems so simple its almost beneath me
have faith alice
close your eyes and enjoy
in exhaustion and resignation cameron nods and wearily closes his eyes
open your eyes
and dont touch
his eyes open
he stares at his face in the mirror pleased at the subtle transformation
his hair has been cut shorter and dyed red somehow changing his whole aspect
he rubs the red mark on his wrists where the bracelet has been removed
part of the laundry room is being used for the films hairdressing department
cameron sits in a barber chair wearing a plastic apron surrounded by dryers wigs etc
washing machines churn constantly
denise the hairdresser an attractive earthy woman of thirty two stands over him
he is still wary and trying not to show it
looking in mirror could be worse
could be green
i think i like it
of course you like it
denise gives great hair
got any grass
shaking his head nope
she touches his hair to test the dryness holding her hand there for a moment longer than seems necessary
he grins at her rises and crosses to the wall mirror to get a better look
what else dont you have that i need
she moves to a basement window and gazes out
through the window the crew is setting up a shot while eli rehearses with nina and his red haired male star raymond bailey who cameron earlier saw on the beach
bailey is dressed as a world war i british aviator and nina as a young girl of that era
our male star isnt going to like you
moving toward window why not
youre too good looking
his idea of a perfect stunt double is two hundreds pounds of hamburger in a red wig
he studies the view his attention focused on nina
whats she like
ive seen her on irritated by his interest in nina at selling douche powder shes fabulous dog food
im not sure shes sincere
what are you sore about
im not sore
isnt that what you wanted to know
with sarcasm or did you mean whats the real nina franklin like without the greasepaint and tinsel
moving to a pile of laundry heaped on the floor she pokes around with the toe of her shoe
you mean whats she like underneath
snaring a crumpled garment she kicks it toward cameron who catches it instinctively then holds it up for inspection a pair of ninas lace panties
he grins mildly embarrassed by the charade
moving toward him what do those say about the girl who wears them
she reaches for the panties but instead takes his hand and yanks sharply pulling him off balance falling back on the laundry pile with cameron on top of her their
faces inches apart surprise on his amusement on hers
touching his hair still wet
cameron is trying to remember what was it eli said
close your eyes relax and enjoy
across the room the washing machines churn whirl and heave
eli and his crew are shooting a scene a pick up shot for the explosion sequence we saw earlier
eli and gabe the cameraman are lying beside the camera
before them the severed arm protrudes from the sand in which its owner is buried out of sight
you sure he can breathe
a mumbling assent from beneath the sand wheres raymond
raymond kneels beside him remember you just crashed
you were wandering the beach behind the german lines looking for a place to hide when you saw the explosion
youre stunned by the carnage
that bomb was dropped by a guy in your squadron
roll the film
through the camera we see the arm protruding from the sand
we hear o
voices yelling turning
we see the fingers begin to move spasmodically
elis voice yells okay raymond
suddenly the fingers on the hand start to swell bigger and bigger
like a rubber glove filling with air
the balloon covered fingers explode
everyone has broken up with laughter at the prank including eli
gabe is patting elis face raymond squeezing his jaw affectionately as one would a pet dogs
cackling gotcha that time
through his laughter yeah you got me another half hour behind
eli climbs to his feet as the laughter subsides
cameron now wearing a uniform exactly like raymonds watches from the sidelines
gently grinning thought the chief could use a little cheering up today
turning quiet and serious so you heard the news about burt
nodding any more word
bitterly afraid not
theres no picture ever made thats worth it
shaking his head ill never understand why these guys do it take the chances
thoughtfully dont know
trying to beat the system i guess
we all know that some day were gonna die of nothing more important than wrinkles
and that makes us so scared and crazy well do anything
go off bridges
there is great sadness among them
eli breaks the mood lightly
thats what our films about or didnt you know
sees cameron hey burt come over here
cameron crosses to them
he and raymond stand appraising each other red haired men in identical uniforms
as raymond offers his hand to eli my new cock and balls
quickly not new
its important not to let that get around as yet
so for the time being lets make like hes the same guy
adding a touch of color but no longer known as bad assed burt
ever since his fortunate rescue
we call him lucky
chuck barton is a tall rugged looking man in his mid thirties the stunt gaffer on elis film
a messenger trots up and presents a receipt book
chuck sets down his stunt bag and signs it absently
your film from that camera in the duesenbergs on the way to the lab
put it on the plane with my own little hands
when do we get it back
stamped it rush
if i stamp rush on my mares ass shell still take eleven months to foal
call the lab and find out when
quietly i lost a man today
i wanna see that footage and find out why
as the messenger leaves chuck strolls over to where cameron stands waiting circles around him sizing him up
cameron is no longer wearing the uniform but now is in jeans and a work shirt
done any stunt work
you have or you havent
good naturedly i got out of vietnam in one piece
let me tell you that wasnt a bad stunt
skeptically thats ancient history
seems like yesterday
pointing at church steeple could you jump from that tower to the that roof
gauging the fifteen foot gap between the church steeple and the roof of the nearby municipal building
he unconsciously grimaces at the four story drop between them
being glib once to save my ass i jumped out of a banana tree into an oxcart full of buffalo shit
does that count
put these on
he throws cameron some knee pads from his stunt bag and begins marking off two lines on the bare earth between the gravestones in the churchyard
puzzled by the pads where do they go
tapping his knee under the pants
pointing to lines he has drawn i want you to jump from here
cameron hops up to the starting line finishing with the knee pads clumsily surveys the distance of not more than seven feet
makes a casual jump landing on the line and looking at chuck for approval
except youre dead
your brains are scattered all over the goddamn pavement
you landed on the edge and fell backwards four stories
where do we send the body
returns to the starting line dont bury me yet
he takes a running start and leaps hard
while hes still in mid air chuck yells
youre still dead
you fell over the other side of the building
cameron has landed three beyond the mark and looks up at chuck a bit shaken
you wanna try it right once
you should land in a tuck and roll
show me sergeant
chuck launches himself head first
his hands touch the ground just beyond the second mark to break his fall easing him into a shoulder roll he somersaults to his feet
he takes a running start and does the same
not quite as well but well enough
as he rolls to his feet okay
my speciality is hopscotch
chuck turns on him enraged overreacting
and burts specialty was drowning
you know one goddamn daredevil on this picture was enough
what the hell was eli thinking giving me a smart ass cocky amateur kid when i need a stunt man
its a little different running across that roof when theyre pumping tracer bullets over your head
eloquently pleading his case i was running for twenty six months with guys shooting at me
not over my head
at my head and im alive
i knew daredevils
i got nothing against them
its just theyre all dead
so ease off and give me a chance
cameron is surprised to see that chuck is grinning
genuinely hey were you putting me on
i wouldnt know how to do that
chuck starts to walk away then stops and looks at cameron
pained can you imaging eli doing a world war i picture without horses
do you know the gags i could do with four runaway horses pulling a caisson
cameron sailing into the shot
chuck ducks slightly catching cameron on his back and flipping him into a somersault
cameron lands on the sharply slanted slate roof of the municipal building
chuck stands beside him straddling the peak
the church steeple can be seen in b
and we now realize time has passed and we are no longer in the graveyard of the previous sequence but atop the building
next time hit me higher
climbing to his feet whats eli got against horses
i love horses
dont butter me up
cameron goes running at chuck and once again flies over his shoulder
sprawling on the slippery slate he looks up to see chuck strolling down the hazardous incline like a mountain goat
cameron scrambles to follow
as he walks well draw a sight line for you to follow down the roof here while youre rolling
now theres nothing very difficult
but this is where you gotta think
your mind cant be on snatch
its gotta be on grabbing that gutter
they have reached the lower edge of the roof
cameron looks down at the drop
or my brains are all over the pavement again right
walking away you know a good falling horse makes more money in four minutes than a bank president does in a year
pictures not over
maybe youll still get your chance
chuck has stopped and they peer down through a skylight to where the crew is setting up a shot in a room below
sadly naw all they care about is story
they move to another edge of the roof overlooking a narrow central courtyard
they gaze down at a window awning two stories below that juts from the side of the building wing across the court
now heres where the scuffle ends
when the pipe breaks loose you fall and hit that awning
then eli yells cut and old raymond takes your place for the close ups and the glory
thats where the german soldiers catch him and throw him in the nuthouse
theyre shootin that scene downstairs now
staring at awning thats supposed to hold me
probably doesnt hold rain
its not a real awning its a catcher
camerons face is beginning to sweat and the veins are bulging from the growing strain of some physical effort
its no harder up here than it is on the ground
camera pulls back to reveal cameron dangling from a section of rain gutter four stories above the ground
its the same gag
its just a little scarier
and thats what you get paid for
alert yeah how much
youre stealing candy with this gag
you get six hundred bucks
almost falling jesus
watch it will ya
helping cameron onto roof what did you think a stunt man is
hes a professional
if the camera jams thats another six hundred and if eli says try it again six hundred more
six fucking hundred bucks
in a large vacant hall on the ground floor of the municipal building a movie set has been erected representing the ward room in a world war i military asylum
in it elis crew is filming a sequence a dozen enraged inmates in tatters heads shaven wild eyed advance toward raymond shrieking as though in echo of camerons exultant yell
raymond dressed as a british flyer his face bloodied crouches and retreats in terror a man caught in a nightmare as these mutilated derelicts suddenly swarm over him
one like a mad dog goes fro his throat another wields his own artificial limb as a club
raymond in character breaks free and screams
for an instant the inmates stop in stunned silence broken only by a distant shout overhead
on the roof overhead six fucking hundred gorgeous beautiful dollars
i cant believe it
the slavering madmen look up then out at the camera madmen no longer simply bewildered actors
eli stands amidst the camera crew photographing the scene
he is waving for order
save it everybody
storming in jesus christ what the hell was that
somebody get their ass up on that roof
cutting him off never mind
i didnt like it anyway
as eli steps down from the dolly a solemn quiet man approaches him from among the onlookers
it is sam baum the writer
the scenes wrong
yells to the a
call a break
calls five minutes and the crew moves toward the coffee urn
eli wanders toward the door sam pursuing
fighting for his scene eli it played like a dream
my god it was marat sade
glumly it played like shit
desperate well who was that on the phone in the middle of the night when you first read it raving about the magical madhouse scene the upstairs maid
eli rips the page with the madhouse scene from his screenplay as they stride out of the building
there beside the rear entrance on a pile of construction sand sits eli cross legged staring morosely at some kids who play nearby
he is absently folding a torn script page into a paper airplane
behind him at a respectful distance stand the production manager a
half a dozen assorted crew chiefs and sam baum all looking concerned
sam looks at the others shrugs and approaches eli squatting beside him on the sand pile
what do you wanna do eli
theyre all waiting
while sam talks eli takes a fistful of sand and pours it in sams shoe
suddenly noticing sam yanks his foot away
irritated being childish isnt going to help your movie
you know theres nothing wrong with the story
removing his shoe and shaking the sand out the real problem is since i wrote this thing two years ago youve had watergate the energy crisis womens lib the economy
is down the tubes
you want to talk about burning issues
theres arsenic in the glue on the back of food stamps
thats why you dont like the madhouse scene
your goddamn war story has lost its relevance
dont be negative sam
we can start a new one in time for the preview
sam has finished replacing his shoe and eli pours a fistful of sand into sams other shoe
cut it out will ya
eli is at the head of a long table camera pulling back to reveal a dozen members of the company dining with him
nina sits beside eli listening with rapt attention to sams monologue her dessert fork sensuously lingers at her lip
two years ago you were all charged up to make a great big anti war statement and they wouldnt let you
now they let you but you havent got a war
what youve got is egg on your face because vietnams long gone and its too late
our pictures not about fighting wars
its about fighting windmills
the truth in elis statement registers on sam
cameron sits farther down the table watching nina watch eli
and wishing she were watching him
war isnt the disease
its only one of the symptoms
hooked whats the disease
thats the big question sam
name the disease and youve licked the screenplay
indicating cameron ask him
cause he knows what the film is about
howd you like vietnam
howd you like bubonic plague
heres another one who hates war
but he enlisted
to cameron you fought in vietnam for two years
i mean actually were out there killing people
hey i didnt kill that many people
dont be modest lucky
everybody digs a little violence
what was that you said on the beach
cameron is starting to bristle at elis needling particularly with nina watching
about getting home for thanksgiving
tentatively that you better figure the guy coming at you is trying to kill you
thats what the disease is about
being scared shitless
whistling in the dark
i wish youd talk to the kid sam i mean it
you know really you guys should room together
getting the last word hey lucky give me your cot by the window and ill let you read a great madhouse sequence
they all laugh
surrendering all right eli
ill write you another scene
what difference does it make
the studio will cut it all out anyway and what you got left is a lot of swell battle scenes which when i was back there they said were just
simply no they wont
yeah what makes you different
quietly because they know if they cut my picture ill kill em
the deadly in elis voice was more than intended and there is suddenly an awkward silence at the table
cameron eyes eli with a wry smile
you mean bang
kill em just like that
matter of fact no
ill kill em and eat em
i hate to waste anything
laughs they call him eli the terrible
sam my picture is the only kid ive got
if the studio said your daughter jennifer would look better with her fingers chopped off what would you do
being an insecure writer id call my agent
and get another opinion
jake the chief of police is seen in the background approaching the table
cameron spots him and starts to rise
if youll excuse me
arriving dont go away burt
i want you
broad welcome jake
long time no see
you taken care of my problem with the beach
im not talking to you
to production manager i understand you got that film out of the duesenberg
cutting in its at the lab jake
im talking to this gentleman
to production manager we want to see it
cameron realizing the film might disclose his presence on the bridge reacts with alarm which increases as eli says
tell the chief its our pleasure
soon as it gets back
but ask him why
choked up with its importance you can tell your mr
cross this inquiry comes from a source so high it is not his to question
now at a loss for proper words it is his to do it or else
someone theyre looking for may have been on that road when the car went off
to cameron burt you see anybody
then suddenly noticing something different about camerons appearance
hey did you have red hair before
indicating denise she sprays it every day so i look like raymond
i didnt see a soul
to the rescue tell the chief that burt was so busy being brilliant he wouldnt have noticed jesus christ walking on the water
jake pulls a photograph from a manila envelope and hands it to cameron
a wire photo front and side views of cameron taken at his military induction
war ages a man
he looks younger and quite different in his gi haircut
you got it upside down
the eyes go on top
cameron hands the photo back to the chief who passes it around the table
denise receives the photograph studies it and glances up at cameron expressionless
he returns her gaze
a couple of telephone linemen say they saw him headed this way
eli takes the photograph
looks like a nice clean cut kid
i know about fifty guys who dont think so
whatd he do
to production manager ignoring elis question the minute that film gets here you give me a call
yawning and rising i dont know about those fifty guys but i know one weary guy whos gonna crawl upstairs and hit the sack
eli looks at cameron with grudging admiration
i know a weary guy whos driving to cape long to dance and booze all night
camping takes gabes hand i know a weary gay whos going with him
they mince off the fag act all the more amusing because of raymonds strictly masculine looks
eli shouts after them
so long as youre back in ninety minutes
its a work night for some of us
loftily those who give a shit
raymond gathers nina along the way wrapping his arm about her shoulders cameron watching silently
then charging from across the dining room like a tanker steaming in their wake comes a gushing overwrought blue rinsed matron
your feminique spray commercial is on tv
my god its simply heavenly
drawers are slamming open and shut as cameron hurriedly stuffs his few belongings into his pockets
its a mean little bedroom with sams clothes typewriter etc
seeing sams wallet cameron pulls a wad of money from it at the same time accidentally knocking sams false teeth off the dresser
he hesitates then stuffs back all the bills but a twenty
he strides to sams closet pulls out shirt and slacks stuffs them in a cloth beach bag also belonging to sam and starts out the door
then he stops gets on his hands and knees looking for the false teeth which he finally finds
now annoyed at himself for being a nice guy he throws them carelessly on the dresser and quickly exits
as cameron moves down the steps the returning company station wagon pulls to a stop in the driveway
nina raymond and a few others emerge from the car
cameron turns away so as not to be seen as they pass him on the steps heading for the entrance
bet theyre looking for that nut who killed all those campers in montana
drunk too many campers weed em out
imagine sitting an hour at a roadblock
we should have waited it wouldnt have been an hour
a theyve entered the hotel
cameron continues to the bottom of the stairs hesitates looking back at nina
silhouetted through the etched glass doors on the other side of the looking glass he sees the lithe gay exquisitely beautiful figure of nina light sparkling from the cut glass
dances about her face a hauntingly romantic image
he watches for a moment with hopeless longing
finally turning from her he looks about at the dark water and deserted boardwalk
there come some of elis crew laughing joking cutting a swatch through the stillness pushing their heavy brutes toward some nearby spot to light a night shot
theres the church tower
he stares at it wavering in his resolve to leave wondering what would happen if
do you rescue the maiden from the tower
she has come up behind him unnoticed
he turns startled and there she stands
for a moment they search each others eyes for intentions
then she glances at the tower
it does look pretty high
with concern are you worried about tomorrow
camerons mind is racing over all the things hed like to say so she would know him instantly
but his answer is simple and sounds sincere
i guess if there were any real danger eli wouldnt let me do it would he
quickly reassuring no
im sure its safe
abruptly with a boyish grin good
then you jump
she understands the slightly jealous rebuke for her blind faith in eli
her laughing answer hangs like a challenge
well come on
willing but flustered what right now
for a moment he weighs it whether to run or stay
then acts on his decision
starting to laugh he takes her hand and pulls her toward the tower
she holds back struggling playfully
wait im afraid of heights
what if i freeze up
pulling her along dont worry ill give you a push
isnt that what a pals for
it is crowded with bells a small walkway and railing surrounded them
the city lights are seen beyond
below are the sheds where crewmen are preparing the next days shooting
just beyond is the overwhelming silhouette of the huge crane
nina and cameron reach the top of the stairs winded and laughing as they rush to the railing and lean over
nina gasps clutching cameron in genuine fright
gasps oh my god
you cant jump from this
youll get killed
laughing its not that bad
it looks worse at night
chuck says its like robbing a candy store
getting angry now stop that
im going back
she whirls to go
he stops her taking her by the shoulders
her concern for him has turned to anger like a mother slapping her child for running in the street
its just dumb
to strut around trying to talk brave
his arm still restrains her
she takes hold of it then suddenly softens with a look of slight surprise
you are scared
seriously not really
after a moment he answers quietly
so are you
and youre not even gonna jump
she is trembling and so is he not from fear
he slowly draws her toward him her mouth reaching up to his
and then they are devouring each other
abruptly theyre illuminated by a fierce blast of white light
they separate and stare blinking in shock and confusion
okay hit two and three
they are pinned in the crossbeams of two more giant arcs
quickly she yanks him down with her out of sight behind the railing
eli is lounging in the bucket suspended from the crane
beside him gabe adjusts one of the giant brutes
business as usual i could kill this brute and fill with juniors
youd get a halo around the tower
struggling to resist got no time
its an establishing shot
two seconds on the screen
giving in you got six minutes
gabe smiles scurries off
eli glances at the tower grins having toyed with them long enough he yells
while youre up there be useful
stand up and look towards the sea so youre in profile
as ninas arm raises into view with the middle finger extended
hollering light this eli
the church door swings open
nina and cameron emerge covering their embarrassment with bravado
nina is prattling as though to a tour guide
and those bells are so interesting
imagine four hundred years ago by boat from amsterdam
thank you for the tour
it was so informative
im going to write my father
hes so interested in god and things like that
want a lift
eli miraculously appears from above
he descends and rides around beside them in the bucket of the crane
ducking oh for christs sake
there once was a maiden fair smooching a guy with red hair
eli get away with that thing
could it be raymond whos turning this dame on
or his double young lucky pierre
unable to elude eli in his basket nina turns on him in mock frustration
its gotten to the point where i have to look under the stopper of the bathtub when i take a shower to make sure ive got some privacy
broadly gesturing to group thank you one and all and good night
privately she gives camerons arm an affectionate squeeze then disappears around the corner of the building
he is left holding the beach bag pursued by the peter pan in the basket
it has now dropped to ground level so eli is looking up at cameron
step right in folks
the killer crane ride of the century
thanks ill walk
elis basket now moves up a few feet so hes looking down at cameron riding beside him while he walks
six hours in town and caught with the leading lady
shouldnt be so upset
okay to be upset about what happened in the dining room
whyd you promise to show that cop the film
hell recognize me
you really dont trust me do you
i got a present for you
he pulls cameron into the basket beside him so unexpectedly that cameron drops sams bag
eli picks it up and plops it into camerons lap
suddenly cameron finds himself soaring skyward at a stomach churning rate while eli rattles on
probing disarming quixotic
you constantly amaze me
you dont go to movies
whats that tatoo a disguise
you a commie
dont you know that king kong was only three feet tall
he came up to fay wrays belly button
if god could only do the tricks we can
what are you worried about the film and the cop for
now hanging ten stories above the city eli is adjusting his viewer looking at a cluster of red flashing lights in the distance
he hands the viewer to cameron who looks through it
a we see a telescoped view of the police roadblock at the end of a highway with cars waiting to get past armed police
muttering what am i worried about the cops for
another one over there
b the view whips to a second police roadblock at the other entrance to town
its a pair
puts viewer down is this my present
no your present is a piece of good advice
patting sams beach bag youve got that look again
that gleam of the sprinter about to set a record for the yard dash
is that why all those cops are chasing you
what are you some kind of sex freak running across america with your fly open
is that why theyre after you
whats your advice
button your fly and be at the airport on sunday at three oclock with the rest of the crew
climb aboard our chartered and fly away with us to where the setting sun bleeds into a million swimming pools a man can hide in
you do swim as well as run
overwhelmed by the offer ill swim like a fish
you really mean it
eli nods why are you trying to save my ass
eli hesitates then answers quietly for him there is great meaning in it
because youre as crazy as the guy im doing the picture about
then grinning archly the mood broken besides ive fallen madly in love with the dark side of your nature
the thunderous clang of bells
cameron ready coiled tight heart pounding as loud as the bells
a burst of machine gun bullets tears through the railing beside him sending splinters flying against his face
harvey second unit director and camera operator behind the mitchell looking up tensely
harvey gestures yelling
near cameron the second a
crouched out of sight with a walkie talkie stabs a finger at him
a burst of tracer bullets streak past cameron
sparks fly as stray bullets seem to bounce and ricochet off the bells
a calibre machine gun a special effects man in levis and sport shirt pumping tracers past the bell tower
the second a
slams his hand down on a plunger setting off a series of explosive squibs
like machine gun bullets they start shattering the railing moving toward cameron forcing him to the edge of the tower
vaulting over the rail he clings to the side of the bell tower
explosive bursts disintegrate the railing in his hand
he shoves out launching himself into space
twisting hurtling across the gap between the buildings falling crashing to the slate roof crawling and scrambling for a hand hold
the relentless tracer bullets chip the slate beside him
crouching low cameron like an animal moves across the roof to the safety of a water tower
squibs burst over his head and spouts of water stream from the tower
moving around the tower suddenly there are two german soldiers running at him with bayoneted rifles
he wheels and there stands another german chuck who leaps toward him slamming down his rifle butt
the blow glances off cameron
they grapple kicking clawing rolling down the steep slope picking up momentum
the roofs edge rushes toward them below it a fearsome drop
camerons hands reach out desperately grabbing for the railing as chuck screaming hurtles off the edge writhing as his body tumbles in space toward the ground
sweat pouring from his face a gash on his cheek gushes blood his eyes glazed he pulls himself back on the roof
chuck lying relaxed on the straw and mattress safety pad which caught him on the ground looks up cups his hands and shouts at cameron
cameron running for his life along the edge of the roof the soldiers shooting down at him from the roofs peak
he reaches the far end looks down
there is the awning jutting from an adjacent wall two stories below
he scrambles off the roof
clinging to the down spout he starts descending it
looking up from the ground he yanks a control rope
the bracket holding the down spout breaks loose
the spout starts to fall away from the side of the building
cameron clings to it riding its downward arc as though it were a falling tree
at the end of the arc cameron throws himself free for a safe landing and smashes against the awning
instead of holding it rips apart like paper and in that unexpected instant camerons eyes widen in genuine terror as he plummets through the shredded canvas toward a skylight one
exploding in a shower of glass and wood as it is struck by camerons body
he hurtles downward toward a blur of images
collapsing from the impact of camerons fall
the man and woman who were making love on the cot have been flung to the ground and roll entwined with him
cameron is dazed
like a drowning man he rages to free himself from the tangle of naked limbs and smothering flesh
a painted face shrieks in laughter as the door to the room he is in is thrown open revealing cameron has fallen into a cubicle in what appears to be
a world war i german army brothel
in the high ceilinged room there is a row of cots separated by makeshift screens
couples jump up from the cots startled
a line of partly naked german soldiers waiting their turn at the whores have broken into shouts and laughter at camerons unorthodox entrance
they crowd around the cubicle where cameron fell and now struggles with the couple
gabe at the eye piece eli beside him photographing the scene
calling out to soldiers the clothes
do the clothes
the men tear him free from the couple shouting playfully
dialect what are you a field marshal
dialect wait your turn like the rest
camerons confusion changes to helpless fury as he kicks and struggles against a forest of grasping hands ripping his clothes away passing him back toward the rear of the line
dialect where are your manners
dialect this is a whorehouse not a stable
whores have left their cots to join in the assault screeching in glee
as he maniacally lashes out at his good natured molesters the blood from camerons face smears a whores body
instantly everything stops
cameron is sprawled half naked on his knees at the end of the line
enraged he whirls toward eli who has caused this humiliation
then the clapping begins the cast and crew applauding his stunt
people slap him on the back admiringly
a robe is thrown around him
he is helped to his feet
suddenly nina is there flinging her arms about him and kissing him on the mouth
im so proud of you
i could just die
he is pulled away from her by the backslappers
now cameron is responding to this strange new sensation the warmth of public acclaim
he regains his poise hoping his embarrassing anger wasnt noticed
chuck is now beside him reaching up to the wound on camerons face and pulling away the plastic makeup patch with fake blood inside the wound is gone
he starts feeling camerons shoulders arms and ribs for possible damage
quietly to chuck wincing in pain why didnt you tell me about the awning
i could have been killed
you were in your mothers arms from the time you hit the sugarglass skylight
those stunt men you fell on would have got you out of anything
the one with the tits and the other guy
why didnt you tell me
afraid id chicken out
eli likes some things spontaneous
makes em more believable
not to think im going crazy
he is moving through the crowd
yelling wheres raymond
raymond were you watching that closely
appearing what can i tell you
im a brave son of a bitch
there is general laughter
eli raising his arm like a referee
were doing the coverage
eli continues toward cameron
chuck is spraying ethyl chloride on his bare tattooed shoulder
to chuck careful
dont blind the eagle
to cameron i owe you six hundred bucks
acknowledging the compliment if anything bothered you be happy to do it again
eli laughs and moves off cameron staring after him
to chuck i cant take my eyes off the son of a bitch
everybody does what he wants them to even me
i feel like thankin him cause i fell on my ass
sarcasm its just a crush
youll get over it
approaching eli who turns to sam eager vulnerable
what did you think
you are a smug insufferable son of a bitch
when i read the insane asylum scene to my wife and four children my wife cried my oldest son shook my hand for the first time in his whole life
so why is it eli that this vulgar little scene turns out to be so much
stronger more moving
touched god knows sam
because you get the feeling that the enemy might just be some poor horny slob like you lookin for the nearest whorehouse
putting his arm around cameron how about that lucky
when that stunt mans boob hit you in the mouth was it just another boob
or did it taste like kraut
the crew laughs and so does nina
cameron feels humiliated by elis patronizing tone
it tasted lousy
but what do i know
you try it eli
youre the expert in bad taste
for the group uh oh sounds like the soldiers got his feelings hurt
i just dont know about germans
where i was we only raped gooks
as though continuing previous dialogue
genially oh is that why the cops are after you
after all this time
you finally guessed it
revealing eli and cameron walking through the hotel garage toward a replica of the lost duesenberg which a mechanic works on
i think youre putting me on
come on now no more hints
he thinks lets see
christ could be anything
i know a guy in this state got years for having cunnilingus with his wife
studies cameron no
i guess youre not the type
more likely some hideous crime of violence
eli is getting under camerons skin
they stop at car
to mechanic have you seen harvey
i think hes in there
mechanic nods toward a door at the rear of the garage
eli pats the fender of the duesenberg
cameron views it with a strange sense of unease
putting his arm around camerons shoulder eli leads him toward the back door yelling to mechanic
youll have it ready on time
yeah but dont look under the hood or youll find a chevy
b at the door eli can barely open it to squeeze through
an incredible number of people have wedged themselves into this tiny smoke filled room peering over each others heads toward a lighted area at the far end
shouting harvey in here
then back to business come on
let me have a little more face
a little more face
eli squats on his haunches peering between the legs of the onlookers and tugs on camerons sleeve to join him
hazily through the restless shifting limbs male and female like the first rays of morning sun breaking through to the depths of the forest we glimpse raymond and gabe shooting
their eight millimeter epic two people screwing in a rowboat
raymond suddenly throws his hands up in despair
indignantly jesus kenneth
all right whos doubling for kenny on the inserts
cameron and eli rise to their feet
can you believe this
they spend the whole day working in a whorehouse and look how they relax
you think sex can save the world
grins at cameron thats not my bag eli
sex or saving the world
the world thats your special job
and jesus are we all lucky to have you around
suddenly cameron is shoved backwards by the door as someone pushes against it to get in
it is harvey standing in the doorway with nina
to eli hey chief ya lookin for me
nina tries to peer over the heads of the crowd pushing into the room
cameron steps toward her without thinking
he wants her out of there
whats going on
joking look whos here
nina we need you
still got your makeup on
nina who by now has seen whats happening laughs
thats a daring touch raymond
there is general laughter but not shared by cameron
he surprisingly finds himself angry at ninas presence here and everyones easy familiarity toward her
she sees cameron and eli through the smokey dimness and works her way toward them smiling
eli puts his arms about her shouting over the din
kidding her just like the old days huh kid
remember the sunglasses and garter belts back when we got our start
make you nostalgic
nina turns to cameron
whats a nice boy like you doing in a place like this
going to rescue the maiden from the boat
he just asked if he could do the rowing
didnt you kid
having fun with me arent you
its elis potty training class
show little lucky the pretty lady
make dirt on the pretty lady
watch little lucky puke
trouble with you is you think the whole world is your own personal crapper
cameron starts to exit have yourself a time
just wallow around in it man
watching you makes me feel like mr
cameron storms out in a rage
eli watches with a thoughtful smile
sam who has witnessed the outburst turns to eli furious goddamn little prudish bastard
no more than you and me
its the human condition
we just hide it better
are you kidding
if that guy in the rowboat was a marine sticking a bayonet in her instead of a cock that uptight son of a bitch would have saluted
eli starts laughing
what are you laughing at
that girl in the rowboat she looks exactly like your daughter jennifer
outraged goddamn you eli
thats not funny
he grabs eli by the shirt front cocking his fist
laughing and wrestling get em sam
kill em boy
thats my uptight killie doggie
sams anger fades to a sheepish grin realizing hes fallen into elis trap
where his daughter is concerned hes just as prudish as cameron
eli snaps an affectionate headlock around sams neck
son of a bitch
still laughing see what i mean
old victorias still got us all by the balls
god save the queen
only difference is we like to make movies about it
with hardly a pause he turns
harvey dailies at six oclock tomorrow morning
were shooting at seven
rubbing his hands together the old pro taking over he starts pushing his way through the crowd
all right now lets put a little bit of class into this production
he elbows his way to center stage
on the folding chairs facing the portable screen a dozen people are silhouetted against the light from the projected dailies
cameron enters pausing so his eyes can adjust to the dark
in the dimness nina sits separated from eli sam and a few others
on the screen a world war i british biplane in steady flight is interrupted by a couple of subliminal cuts
another subliminal flash holds and replaces the scene on the portable screen
its a nudie shot a rear view of the lady taken in the rowboat the night before
what the hell is that
the watchers all break up recognizing the work of raymond and gabe
hey nina theres your toothpaste commercial
i love her smile
as nina laughs good naturedly the airplane is back on the portable screen
involuntarily smiling to himself and now less uptight about last night he walks over and sits down beside her
whispering how they get the film developed so fast
without even glancing at him nina gets up and moves to a chair some distance away
he is stunned then angry
then resigned to the ways of women he goes over and sits beside her
whats the matter
turning on him dont let the fact that eli treats you as an equal go to your head
nina were watching dailies
im sorry eli
but he can say anything and thats okay
what goes on in that dim little head of yours
how dare you open your mouth to him like that
have you the vaguest idea what hes trying to say to people with this film
that man is the most dedicated kindest
elis voice interrupts angry like a schoolteacher dismissing a child for talking
nina you can go now
nina close to tears quickly gets up and hurries out of the theater as cameron sits there numbly staring at the screen
on the portable screen raymond in helmet and goggles is in the cockpit of an airplane
he stuffs a bottle of champagne into a leather flying boot dangles the package over the side and lets it go
raymond looks down and salutes like that famous scene in who says nothin changes
like to see one of our boys in a b try that
elis voice yells cut on the sound track
the angle on the portable screen widens and we see that the airplane sits on the ground with an electric fan blowing wind in raymonds face
now the scene on the portable screen changes from the ground we see the same biplane flying low
an object drops from the cockpit the boot
then there is a burst of flame in the engine
trailing smoke the plane wobbles crash lands sliding alarmingly close to camera
it ground loops goes up on one wing and as it crashes down we see that the pilot who we assumed was raymond is really a dummy that is flapping
absurdly and falling to pieces before our eyes during the crash
there are groans laughter and raspberries jesus eli im sorry
ill do a pickup
laughing its so awful its beautiful
wish i could use it
sarcastic thats all wed need
getting morose we goddamn well need something sam
something better than we got
tight lipped better
starting to shout dropping a dead mans boots over his own airfield out of chivalry
thats not crazy enough for you
they did it in wings
even the dummy was bored
anxiety at the breaking point eli please
you simply will not accept the fact that we are living on borrowed time
but eli and sam are not listening
you cant shake your finger at em sam
if youve got something to say you better slip it in while theyre laughing and crying and jacking off over the sex and violence
he should do something
belligerent like what
something to catch the stink of madness behind all that good clean fun
why the hell did we pick world war i in the first place
the ultimate romantic insanity
shouting like what
i dont know what
what would lucky do if he were on the wing of that plane
picture that because it would be a hell of a lot realer than that flapping dummy
cameron is startled
he was not aware that eli even knew he was in the room
is that what youre after reality
i thought you wanted something outrageous
reality can be pretty outrageous
look at soldier boy there jumping off fucking buildings risking his ass every day doing stuff way over his head
what would you do in that plane lucky if you were about to die
off guard embarrassed what else
id dance for joy
id probably do a jig
thats what well do
all right not a jig
on the wing of the airplane
contempt thats ridiculous
youre damn right
the charleston is silly
they wont believe it
excited ill do it so theyll believe it
smugly youll get a laugh eli
only when i want them to laugh
toward rear of the room right lucky
it screams down vertically full power machine guns blazing then smashes into the earth shredding to fragments hurled in every direction
the dead german pilot is flung crumpled to the ground
the planes carcass explodes filling the screen with fire and black smoke through which we see a brightly colored parachute descending
the figure dangling beneath it passes through the smoke and flames and tumbles to the ground rolling his parachute now ablaze
it is cameron dressed in a british flyers uniform
to show the hand held arriflex at gabes eye eli behind him steering gabe by the back of his belt and carrying the battery pack as they photograph cameron shedding
with the camera they crouch and move together like a three headed four armed four legged creature
banking steeply a british fighter roars past cameron its wingtip almost brushing the ground machine guns rattling driving some advancing german soldiers back toward the woods
the plane touches down to rescue cameron the pilot beckoning
cameron has pulled off the dead german pilots boots and helmet
stray bullets strike about him as he sprints to the idling british plane
it is a single seater
it starts to pick up speed
he grabs a strut and scrambles up onto the lower wing
the bucket hanging from the giant crane descends
smoothly eli guides gabe backward seating him in the bucket
the bucket rises lifting gabe while he photographs the scene as the plane with cameron on the wing becomes airborne
behind it is a crowd of spectators who jump up and down shrieking
camera pans to show nina among them her excitement hardly more controlled
the giant arm of the crane swings and rises with the plane completing gabes spectacular shot
now we see a helicopter drop into frame photographing the plane from the other side
the chopper and the vintage british plane bank together in perfect tight formation with cameron standing spread eagled between the wing struts like a flying christ as they soar into
seated on the wing his back against he fuselage legs firmly against the struts
his white silk scarf streams into the tearing wind
jamming a champagne bottle into the germans boot he holds it up
the pilot grins approval popping the cork on a second bottle which spouts foam into the slipstream
laughing he passes a glass to cameron and pours from above
the liquid is lost in the wind
shrugging he swigs from the bottle and hands it to cameron
the champagne pours down his throat and face and holding the strut with one hand he rises to his feet
the pilot waggles his wings giving cameron a seesaw ride to get his bottle back
cameron now seems drunk
he lets go of the strut and stands leaning against the wind
as the pilot toasts his courage camerons balance falters and he grabs the strut
now cameron picks his way through the guywires toward the end of the wing
then he bounces up and down rocking the plane
the pilot starts to sing to camerons rhythm how ya gonna keep em down on the farm
and cameron dances the charleston
gabe at the eyepiece of the mitchell slowly tilting up and down to follow the action
fan fucking tastic
whaddya been feeding that soldier boy
through the plastic bubble the biplane can be seen in the distance going through its antic maneuvers
its not what hes eating
its whats eating him
that makes it sort of interesting
through intercom okay drop the package
cameron holds the boot poised lets go
then the pilot is struck by a bursting shell
as he slumps over the plane skids and slips and drops off into a spin
cameron clings for his life as the sickening momentum grows until his feet are flung out from under him and he dangles from the wing whipping in space
suddenly it becomes clear how what we are seeing is possible the airplane is no longer in flight but is dangling a few feet above the ground suspended from the
cable of the huge crane
the crewmen shove at its tail and wingtips to keep it revolving
cameron is indeed clinging to the wing strut his feet held in space by the centrifugal force
but if his hands slip he will fall ten feet instead of to certain death
how is it
panning and tilting su fucking perlative
into walkie talkie okay now level out
easing some levers back
as the spin slows down and the plane appears to level out cameron regains his footing perches on the wing and looks forward in growing horror
as the swinging arm of the crane glides the plane forward toward a stand of trees at the edge of a clearing
we see the rapidly approaching trees
closer and closer until with a horrendous crash the plane sails between two trunks shearing off the wingtips the nose smashing into another hurling cameron off the wing like a
crumb flicked from the table
apparently hurtling through the air his eyes widen at the impending impact
a gasp and then a sharp cry
but instead of the crash
the angle widens and we see it is cameron reaching orgasm
with extreme contentment on his face he rolls over revealing nina who it is clear has also had a lovely time
they are in bed in a pleasant large room the queen anne suite untidy with script pages wigs costumes fresh flowers the leftovers of a room service dinner
nina caresses his back noticing bruises
she kisses them gently and starts to giggle
he looks at her quizzically
thats twice for me today
and when i watched you do the stunt
the alarm clock on the dresser begins ringing
he sits up puzzled
i have to study my scene for tomorrow
the old lady at the cemetery
i set the clock in case we dozed off
cameron gets up moving toward the dresser to turn off the clock but instead stops at the stand holding the old lady wig
he runs his fingers through it as the clock continues to ring
how come they cast you as an old lady
i start out as a young girl hiding this american flyer
will ya turn off the clock
subtly we sense something is bothering cameron
he ignores the still ringing clock
anyway his patriotism is stronger than his love and he leaves me with another little patriot in my belly
during this he has taken the wig and puts it over his head glancing in the mirror
why cant i double for both of you
i could use the money and i dont look half bad
seriously honey youll ruin it
take it off
the clocks electric
itll ring forever
instead of turning off the clock he crosses to the old ladys dress on a hanger
he looks at the dress appraisingly
eli might really go for that the big soldier as a little old lady
disturbed nina leaves the bed turns off the alarm clock and adjusts the wig properly on its stand
they embrace and cling to each other
she starts back for the bed but he detours for the clock and pulls out the alarm again and again it begins ringing
what are you doing
weve got to consider eli
if you dont study the scene hell be mad
then youll get mad
and ill get shot out of a cannon
with the alarm still ringing he starts toward the bed
did you fall on your head today
i want it to ring
for me thats why
thats eli yelling for you to work on your scene and us saying up yours eli and i like that
do you want to leave
i want to make love to you while eli is screaming his head off
the whole idea is so incongruous that she starts laughing
he gets on the bed with her
the alarm continues to ring
they struggle about giggling at the absurdity
i cant make love with the clock ringing
while he moves over her body she grabs a pillow and hurtles it at the clock
it falls over but keeps on ringing
by now cameron has entered nina and she is rapidly becoming more involved in that than in the clock
to ringing clock while making love to nina you tell em eli
in the darkness the machine is like an ominous hunchback splattering shards of light against chucks intensely watching face
he is highly disturbed at the unseen image
to himself crazy bastard
angle widens showing a small storage room has been converted to a makeshift editing room where chuck sits working the moviola
slowly becoming aware of someone he glances up through the spinning reels and dimly sees cameron leaning in the doorway
there was no way it could go wrong
unless he just went ape
cameron ambles over as chuck reverses the film to see it one more time
even as he catches a glimpse of the film whirring backward he realizes hes seeing burts death scene in the water
now chuck has reached the beginning of the film and is moving it forward again
the film whirs as we see through the windshield over burts shoulder the car flying through the air hitting the water and sinking beneath the surface
burt goes through the motions of a man trying to free himself
the harness is okay
the roof is holding
it all seems fine
but look at him struggle
eli wouldnt use a foot of it
poor slob died for nothin
sweat is running down camerons face
finally with dread
in the windshield
what about it
probably from the impact
no water coming in
camerons face reflects immense relief
at least hes not guilty of that
the flung stone was not the cause
now abruptly burts body begins to move more violently
look at that
hes starting to panic
will you for christs sake tell me why
as chuck slows the film we see burts head duck beneath the view of the underwater camera leaving only the steering wheel and windshield
for an instant the current changes the light and the crack glows brightly like a spider web
burt reappears his face now toward camera wild with terror
the slow motion lends a bizarre elegance to his agony
abruptly the film goes black
thats where it stops
that fuckin henry
got spooked and took his finger off the remote button
is this how the story was supposed to end with the flyer dying in the water
sure as shit ended that way for burt didnt it
in one of the private dining rooms off the lobby tables and chairs are pushed against the wall to make room for a rehearsal now in progress
some early morning tourists have gathered outside the entrance watching
a few members of the kitchen staff peer through an inside doorway
sam and key crewmen stand on the sidelines as eli rehearses with nina
gesturing the graveyards over here
he takes a few steps her cars parked here
sets down a folding chair lots of these little graveyards along the roadside
most of the stones are unmarked
he takes nina by the hand and pulls her down beside him kneeling on the floor
all things which meant so much are gone
whats left is a single memory
that brief bright love
ninas listening intensely but something catches her eye
among the tourists at the doorway stands cameron who has paused to watch his costume slung over his shoulder
he nods to her with a small tender smile
subtly so eli wont notice she smiles back then renews her concentration
you spent your months pension in hiring the car
you just cant look for his grave any longer
so you pick one
then lay the flowers down
yells to the prop man what have we got for her
i got roses
something she picked herself
wildflowers or something
sam crosses over to them and kneels beside eli and nina
an idea maybe
instead of flowers what if she brought him the things of their life together
of their sexuality
like her nightgown her underclothes
eli looks at him thoughtfully
course theyd be rags by now but let me show you this
from a paper bag he takes a small bronze casting of a bear and a girl on a swing beneath a tree
he sets it down
sams hand presses a lever on the side of the bronze
there is a whirring of the clockwork and a music box melody plays
the girl begins to swing
the bear slides toward her
she mechanically lifts her bronze dress until they meet performing their clockwork love rite
mechanical bronzes were quite a thing
eli shakes his head patiently kindly
sam youll get a belly laugh
what do you mean
itll break their hearts
eli begins to beam
sam realizing he has again fallen into the trap winces chagrined
eli grabs him in a bear hug
welcome to the picture sam
sam struggles to escape from the iron grip as eli dances him about in joy
denise with spray can and fingertips is massaging in red dye as the camera pulls back
naw nothin too unusual today
get run over by a tank blown up by a land mine a house falls on me
easy stuff but i can use a rest
and some manners
as one of the worlds greatest middle weight lovers i hate to play a one night stand
i heard you been busy but you know the old saying
like if you cant come call
appeasingly i wanted to but i was scared
theyre so square where i hail from
twice is considered a love affair
didnt want to rush you
three times is a love affair
twice is nice
yelling hey denise for christs sake
we got a set call in forty minutes
to include a makeup table against the far basement wall with three actors sitting at it wearing plastic aprons to shield their uniforms
to cameron you just sit here
she crosses to the men at the makeup table
glad ya could tear yourself away
hes still got that whole big emotional thing to do with the dog food lady before they even get to you
you may not work til midnight
elill wave his wand and get it out of her in five minutes
trimming his hair youre confused
he got it into her in five minutes
to get it out of her
it takes longer
there is general knowing laughter as denise crosses back to cameron and sees by the look on his face she has hit her target
the thought of nina and eli as lovers had never occurred to cameron
somebody didnt know
the effect is stronger than she had expected
now compassion sets in
im a woman scorned
ill say anything
cameron just sinks back in the chair slowly dying
over the tinkling sound of the music box the bear and maiden perform their ritual as the camera pulls back revealing the gravestone decorated with the worn filmy lace undergarments
of another era
they flutter in the soft wind and amber light of a summer afternoon strangely beautiful against the mossy granite marked unknown
somehow these rotting womens underthings have the dignity of a sacred tapestry draping an altar
you terrible bear
tearing something so beautiful
the angle widens and we see nina now made up to look wrinkled and gray tragically old her eyes moist as she kneels beside the grave
sudden deep sincerity why do i lie
i couldnt wait either
i think both of us are bears
a soft nostalgic smile go young maiden youll be late for your piano lesson
an elegantly dressed caribinerri italian policeman appears
im almost finished
some flowers perhaps
would be permitted
but we want these
its not right
the grave is unmarked
ask the driver how many graves we visited today
i could have chosen five hours ago
i came here and my soul said oh yes
i know that is hard to believe
shrugging anything is possible signora
tries urging her to her feet now you must permit me to escort you to your car
as soon as i am gone you will take everything away
tears streaming down her face you will and i cant stop you and its wrong
we loved each other
where else should these go
the unexpected sound of laughter makes her turn to see a small group of people whove gathered beside their parked cars watching
yes i know im ridiculous but you laugh without knowing anything
you would buy a plastic wreath for a man of such importance
she pulls free of the caribinerri and trying to kneel down stumbles and falls
now like some confused child she searches among the garments
taking a scroll from a wooden box she shakes it at them like a schoolteacher would a ruler
from the president of the united states
to me for sheltering him
smiling to herself how silly
i sheltered him to be with him
he was my beloved
where is it
oh here did you see this
she now holds up a fist from which dangles a swastika on a sash
given to me by adolf hitler
for our son
her voice suddenly fierce with the pain of that memory
then with simple reverence a thousand years of peace
is what he said
that would be very nice
the caribinerri spellbound has taken a backward step bumping into a reflector which now teeters and falls into the scene knocking off his hat barely missing the old lady and
crashing across the grave and shattering all illusion
the caribinerri stands there with his eyes closed and his fists clenched wishing he were in the grave
nina stands in speechless horror
eli ill kill myself
its deadly silent as eli walks over to nina
they stare at each other for a moment
eyes brimming over thank you baby
they fall into each others arms like lovers never do
everybody is applauding wild with joy over ninas great performance
tears of happiness run unabashedly down sams nose
only cameron is sullen seething with anger and jealousy as he views them in the light of his recent information
through bull horn all right that wraps the graveyard
dont pack it
just stick it in the truck
come on were losing sun everybody
in ten minutes at the farmhouse
cameron is standing aside while nina vainly looks around for him
denise is unpinning her wig
chuck approaches cameron
change of plans
were making the stunt a fire gag
when you come out of the barn youre in flames
wanna try it
cameron still watching nina and eli in the now dwindling circle of admirers doesnt answer
look dont do it if you dont wanna
what does eli say
you know eli
tell the soldier its an extra hundred bucks and hell do it without the asbestos
tell eli to do it
hey what the hell is wrong with you
im tired of being somebodys goddamn clown
moving into the shot hey you dont want to do it dont do it but be happy
its a great day
did you see her performance
its a day for humility and brotherly love
lets be brotherly
milk brothers sucking from the same tit
as it explodes cameron is blown through the wall on fire
he tumbles to the ground frantically writhes rolls trying to smother the flames finally collapsing in some wagon tracks filled with muddy water
cameron lifts his head at the approach of a thundering sound
an english caisson hurtles toward him the driver dead and mangled over the barrel of the gun the horses insane with terror
before cameron can move the charging horses are on top of him
he rolls between their hooves the giant steel wheel of the caisson barely missing him
shells from a cannon barrage are bursting all about
cameron staggers to his feet and scrambles over a low stone wall for protection drops to the other side and then hurtles into the air as the wall is shattered
by an exploding shell
as cameron falls into the shot landing on a hidden trampoline near the stone wall bouncing up and down til he finally comes to rest
who said that
cameron stares over the edge of the trampoline as henry the assistant cameraman uneasily faces eli
we had a film run out
to gabe how many feet are left in that camera
checking the mitchell thirty six feet
eli advances murderously on the assistant cameraman building to a rage we have not seen in him before
how many times are you going to do this to me
how dare you yell cut on my set
defensively thirty six feet is nothing
its twenty two seconds
in twenty two seconds i could break your spine
i could pinch your fucking head off like an insect and smear it on the pavement
i could put twenty two bullets in that fat gut of yours
the only thing i cant seem to do in twenty two seconds is keep you from fucking up my film
cameron is so intrigued that he hasnt realized an ember is burning through his asbestos protector until suddenly he feels the flame and frantically begins beating it out and thus
is even denied the pleasure of savoring elis anguish
rosy faced and dewy eyed and wearing a big floppy hat
sensing trouble with cameron and that she might be at fault she has decided to do a campy cutesy blanche dubois stepping off the streetcar named desire number ten years
southern belle sarcasm i cant tell you how pleased i was with your conduct
when you congratulated me after my scene this afternoon all the other glowing tributes faded to nothing
sam has stopped typing and sits silently waiting for the storm
cameron lies on his bed in a t shirt and shorts an elastic bandage around his knee and an ice bag at his neck coldly watching ninas performance as she
grandly moves through the doorway into the room
nevertheless im cancelling your invitation to an intimate party given by my parents who arrived unexpectedly to honor me on the occasion of my birthday
but dont feel too badly
as consolation for a lovely evening missed im presenting you with the good sport of the month award
from behind her back she takes an apple with a tiny cocktail parasol stuck in it and holds it out to cameron
cameron lies glaring at her with mounting rage
baum will you notify this young savage that its customary to cover ones privates when accepting an award
its one of the common courtesies like
coldly what should i congratulate you for
the fucking scene or for fucking the director
nina stands there shaken looking at him sadly
for fucking the director honey
biting into apple didnt you know thats how little girls get into the movies
cameron lies there seething then abruptly leaps up and storms into the bathroom
sam sits rubbing his head resumes typing
cameron rages out of the bathroom flings himself onto the bed
unwinding the elastic bandage he sprays ethyl chloride on his knee
sams typing stops
quietly young man taking my life in my hands i must inform you that you are an asshole
cameron ignores sam
being a devout masochist it follows that im elis best friend
i know quite a lot about him and nina
you and the entire crew buddy
wryly he met her three years ago
two lonely people rattling around new york
a brutal winter
elis marriage had just broken up
interrupting in anger all she had to do was tell me
she could have done that in four seconds
they went to bed once and they were lousy as lovers
but they had a problem
they liked each other
they recognized some area of mutual sensitivity
im boring you
you telling me he banged her once three years ago
disgusted im going to see if they can put me up in the employees toilet
he begins to type again then philosophically
i think he banged her twice to confirm the awful truth
was she supposed to be a virgin
but he says this so sadly and looks so miserable that sam knows he has reached him and it touched
i had a virgin once
had to go to guatemala for it
she was blind in one eye and had a stuffed alligator that said welcome to miami beach
cameron sits there feeling dumb and full of regrets
then he gets up goes to sams closet and begins rummaging through the clothes
sam watches him curiously
so hows the new ending coming
i got fourteen versions
take your pick
worried about his clothes what are you doing in there
overly casual fourteen gory ways to die
in one version he lives
turns the girl in opens a gay bar in berlin gains fifty pounds and changes his name to goering
now deeply concerned please anything but the sweaters
youll stretch the hell out of the sleeves
the pleasant seafood restaurant is on the pier over the water
cameron now wearing sams sweater after all is searching about the crowded room trying to find nina and what might be her family
he is about to leave when he sees a group at a window table a man and woman in their early fifties and a fourteen year old girl attractive despite
the baby fat
something about the composite of all their features is familiar enough to give them a second look
in doing so he sees a half eaten birthday cake on their table in front of an empty place
he goes to the table
hesitantly i was sort of invited to a birthday party and i cant seem to find it
and this seems to be a birthday party
the father a hearty bluff good natured man looks at cameron amiably and with a fathers intuition
a birthday party is a birthday party
cameron does who was this birthday party for
animal vegetable or mineral
nancy the fourteen year old giggles
will you stop teasing this young man
shes really worth finding maam
shes a very rare mineral
pleased with cameron how old is this mineral
this morning she was acting about ninety but she might be lying a year or two
the father now really comfortable recognizing a fellow humorist
no you got the wrong table
this ones acting like shes six
but the missus tells me birthdays are very emotional for the ladies
at this moment cameron can tell from their faces that theyve seen nina behind him
nina has emerged from the ladies room looking miserable and is walking toward them
at the shock of seeing cameron her hand flies to her mouth in such embarrassment and joy and confusion at the way she feels that she starts back to the
refuge of the ladies room
catching herself she turns back to face him her eyes now glowing with tears of happiness
he moves forward and kisses nina
we now realize we are at her hotel room door
she on the inside he on the outside kissing through the doorway which stands slightly ajar
with their mouths barely parting im sorry it got so late
that damn five oclock makeup call
i feel as bad as you do
in the same place i do
will you take a raincheck
slipping her room key in his pocket a permanent one
he puts his hand on the pocket and grins at her
a season pass
smiling good night
closing the door
on henry the assistant cameraman who eli screamed at his luggage beside him his elbows empties loose change scattered before him on the bar top
looking up lucky
hey lucky come over here
angle shifts to include cameron a few stools down
he looks up from his beer and crosses to henry
guess who tole em to take their job and stuff it
gettin out tonight
but not without splittin a schlitz with the one guy cept me who wouldnt take shit from that screwball
as the bartender is taking away the empties henry puts his finger down on a dime
change is for you except that
thats a very special dime
holds it up for cameron to see know what this is
its a dime
am i close
its eli cross ass
people think cause youre easygoin they can walk all over you
im blowin the whistle with this dime in that phone
killin a man and hiding it from the police
are you kiddin
who is he think he is
cameron pales knowing that drunken henrys desire for revenge can expose him to the police
he grabs the dime from henrys fingers and drops it into a peanut vending machine
what the hell you doin
cameron stuffs the bag of peanuts in henrys shirt pocket grabs his suitcase and hustles him out of the bar toward the front door
im putting you in a cab for your own good and sending you to the airport
hes mine henry all mine
just leave that son of a bitch to me
they have reached the hotel doorway
by now henry is convinced cameron means business
do whatever you wanna do but i better do it with ya
youll need help cause that goddamn looney is dangerous
blustering not to me he aint
im going to the cops
you gotta earn your living in pictures but i dont give a shit
he cant hurt me
dont be too sure
damned psycho nearly strangled me
dont believe me
wanna see marks
tears open shirt collar to show bruises lucky to be alive
confused henry what are you talking about
i watched that whole thing today he didnt even touch you
when burt went into the water
cameron is wide eyed i could tell from up there in the chopper something was wrong
so i stopped shootin and that crazy man gets me by the throat and starts screamin to roll the film
i mean that guys down there dying and hes screamin keep shooting
then he starts fighting me for the switch and it falls down
like a crazy house up there with him thrashin on the floor
he didnt care about burt
all he cared about was to get that man dyin on film
sickest thing i ever seen
as henrys last words sink in cameron stands pale and shaken
i better grab that cab
henry takes the suitcase from camerons numb hand and pushes through the door looks back for a parting shot
you tell em everything
dont mince words
as he goes towards cab some merrymakers push their way into the lobby
staring ahead henrys words echo like his own death warrant
the merrymakers jostle past him discussing suntan ointments
cameron turns and walks across the hotel lobby and up the stairs
his pace increasing until he is taking them three at a time
camerons hand thrusts key into the hole flings open the door to ninas bedroom and barges in
your crazy eli
over his shoulder we see nina naked lying on the bed
raymond also naked sits slumped on the edge of the bed utterly disconsolate
the three stare at each other an absurd tableau
cameron whirls and leaves slamming the door behind him almost off its hinges
he comes down the steps like a madman
raging cameron stomps across the lobby toward the glass doors that will take him out of elis grotesque wonderland
he collides with a group of returning night fishermen still in their slickers carrying their equipment their catch wrapped in newspapers
for a moment he is tangled in their tackle fish tumbling and sliding along the marble floor
dont step on em
cameron stares at them whirls and rushes back across the lobby and up the stairs
as cameron bursts in
she stands in her robe in the center of the room glaring at him
screaming get out of here
hearing water running in the bathtub he dashes in but finds the bathroom empty
he moves to the closet and slides the door so violently that it almost falls off no raymond
raging ill have you thrown out
she crosses to the phone
is there anybody in this whole company you havent screwed
a in the hallway a little group of passing tourists turn in wonderment at the tumult through the open doorway
nina leaves the phone crosses to the door and kicks it shut in the peoples faces with all her strength
furious you stupid ignorant bastard
how dare you storm in here like you won me in a raffle
cameron realizing for the first time that instead of being ashamed or frightened she is livid with rage
coldly my girl gave me her key
i am not your girl
i am that mans girl
that man and i have been lovers for six months
ive known you two days
ironically then gee maam i sure hope you didnt tell him about all that ballin last night
dont you dare be clever with me
he came scratching at the door tonight like a beaten dog begging me to say that you were some twenty four hour nonsense
against her will she starts to cry and i had to tell him i thought i was falling in love with
not giving an inch you couldna said that with your clothes on
nina lets out an incoherent roar of rage
the wounded stud
he is entitled to some dignity
to lose his pure and faithful lover without the new boy barging in
where do you suppose he is now
did ya look in the laundry hamper
get the hell out
cameron crosses to the door
searching through this madness for some kind of logic turning on her
i dont have any rights
i dont have the right to be pissed off
you dont have the right to breathe
i knew him before i met you
do you understand that
before i met you
if we were frightened we woke each other in the dark
we slept in each others arms
interrupting the word is fuck
all right the word is fuck
you narrow insensitive stupid
dont push me
i dont know this freaky world you live in but i know that there still must be a couple of places where people somehow believe in
he is at a loss for words
believe in what
a place where what
dont get embarrassed at this late date
a place where a guy has a right to blow his top if he finds his lover screwing
interrupting raymonds lover
cameron exhausted slides down the wall and sits on the floor
ill have it typed up and notarized
and you will sign where it says agreed
he says nothing
she on the bed and he on the floor are drained of all strength and emotion
quietly you wont turn me into some rotten whore because your papa once told that a woman is a certain way and thats how its gonna be til gabriel blows
i just want to sit a couple of seconds without having to say a word
because if i start trying to say im sorry i caught you and raymond fucking ill start laughing and when i laugh too hard i get the hiccups and they
can last for days
after a long beat softly dont get hiccups
quietly isnt anything what it seems to be
quietly dont you think thats kind of lousy
they sit there unable to leave each other unable to move to each other
they just sit there
dailies are in progress
eli watches surrounded by a few crew members
cameron sits in the back row with ninas mother father and sister
nina is not present
on the portable screen is a shot of nina as a wild radiant eighteen year old austrian girl running pell mell along a willow lined village street dodging children and
she collides with an old man her basket falls its contents scattering his momentary anger vanishing as he is infected with her joy of life
he helps her refill the basket and she rewards him with a sausage and a kiss
the old man watches her wistfully as she runs away
theres a tear of pride in ninas mothers eye
father gently puts his hand on top of hers as the room lights come on
you okay back there
happy as clams
brightly shes so beautiful
isnt it amazing how they put it all together and
but eli is already involved in the script girls notes
sam should see this
i think i left in a line of his dialogue
yelling to projectionist go ahead
the room dims and the film starts
we see a slate board reading a take
the clapper claps and the board is removed revealing an attic
nina sprawled on her stomach stark naked atop raymonds naked body her breasts resting on his chest her legs apart interlocked with his
they look directly at the camera awaiting their cue with the calm resignation of two people waiting for the wilshire bus
the makeup girl appears in the shot spraying ninas back and ass with glycerin sweat from an aerosol can
she disappears as elis voice on the sound track calls action
the angle tightens into a less revealing more artistic composition
their mouths meet
their bodies writhe
they stare at the screen in open mouthed shock and horror
their once gentle hands grip each other like iron claws trying to squeeze away the nightmare
in shock and anger leaning forward on the edge of his chair looking from eli to the parents not knowing what to do to stop this
she sinks down in her seat her surprise becoming malicious pleasure at the reaction of her parents
upset sweet christ
i told em to hold that
starting to leave her seat ill stop it
restraining her resigned too late now
only make it worse
we hear the passionate murmurings from the screen as eli scrunches down in his seat
the lovers convulse with erotic abandon as they approach orgasm
like a charles addams rendering of a brady tintype
their faces wear the stiff frozen smiles of the hopelessly insane
shes now made up to look like a woman in her forties
everything about her tells us these have been brutal years filled with pain and loss
she is reacting in anguish to something o
but even though she manages a few tears it doesnt quite ring true
eli steps into the shot
to the crew o
all right save it
on the sidelines as he coldly watches eli put his arm around nina and stroll her away from the crew so they are out of earshot
the shame of it
youve lost your son your lover
you want to tear his throat out
but you stand meek
your guts burning with the shame of it
god i dont know whats wrong with me
she has looked up at her parents who stand off to one side like zombies watching
maybe its them
i feel like im in a zoo
let me say bye bye and get em on their way
it might help
she starts to move towards her parents but eli puts a restraining hand on her
you better know this
dont get all shook up now
nina looks at him with foreboding
something got screwed up
the attic scene
the bare ass attic scene
i dont know how
it was too late to stop it
she has not blinked not turned her heard for fear that her fathers eyes might meet hers
she is like a statue trembling in an earthquake about to shatter
the sick loathesome shame that fills her brims over and the statues blind eyes flow tears
tense barely breathing
an urgent whisper roll film
he eases back out of view
the angle slowly tightens
as she falls apart before our eyes and an o
voice on a playback tape insinuates into our consciousness echoing as though heard through many loudspeakers
i envy you the pride you must feel today
a young hero has fallen gloriously on the field of battle
hands reach in and drape a sash around ninas throat
from it dangles a swastika
for nina there is still no voice no camera only the obliterating shame for that image of her naked body burned into her fathers memory
and yet that shame is so similar to the shame she should be feeling as the woman in elis film at this mockery of her sons death
a nation has lost a son
a mother has lost a son
the sound has now grown to a proportion reminiscent of those german newsreels of hitler victory rallies
this sacrifice in blood brings closer mans noblest dream
a thousand years of peace
the thunderous sound of ten thousand voices shouting sieg heil
has shattered ninas isolation
she is now aware that her personal despair has been used to accomplish an acting trick and it only adds to her degradation and sense of shame ironically making her
performance even more poignant
the crowd on the playback roars with fanatic zeal
striding rapidly down the hall looking like a man who hopes to find a fight to dissipate his residual anger
he rounds a corner almost colliding with eli who comes rapidly from an intersecting corridor
eli puts his arm around camerons shoulder hurrying him along even faster
last one theres on medicare
cameron shrugs his arm off in annoyance as they round the corner and hurry down some stairs
where are we rushing to
i was asleep
trouble staying awake huh
they reach the bottom of the steps and move swiftly down another corridor as eli fishes through his pockets and comes up with a stick of gum
makes you hum
ignored he chews it himself do you read
eli finds a booklet he has been looking for and hands it to cameron
schickel and bergenstadt
couple of dutch comedy writers
see its got pictures
but dont skim
chucks gonna quiz you
if you pass you get a free trip to amsterdam and you can stick your finger in a dike
looking at the book as he walks what the hell is this
a pamphlet on how to get out of a sunken car
you know they got this problem in holland
so these guys are experts
did burt read this
off hand id say no wouldnt you
hands it back to him no chance
there you go rejecting me again
eli pushes open the double doors and they find themselves standing in the makeshift screening room
youve gotta think positive burt
jake is there with several other men
but before cameron can even register who they are eli is saying
im sorry gentlemen but ive got exactly two minutes of borrowed time
im in the middle of a scene
to projectionist get it started
immediately the lights snap off and the film is projected on the screen
in the dark the men in the room fumble their way to seats
on the projection screen we see a helicopter shot of the duesenberg approaching the bridge
cameron is suddenly alert like a jungle beast whos just heard the trap slam shut behind him
his eyes dart around at the official looking faces staring at the o
one face looks disturbingly familiar but in the dark he cant place it
addressing a man next to him this fellow here is the stunt man driving that car
to cameron thompson is from the fbi
they wanted you here in case they have any questions
on the projection screen we see the duesenberg go off the edge of the bridge disappear in the water
i dont see anybody else on the road
did you burt
the man cameron couldnt recognize speaks out
my buddy and i saw that son of a bitch break out of the woods and head that way down the road
the lights go on and cameron looks at the speaker recognizing him as one of the telephone linemen
apparently the lineman doesnt recognize cameron in his new identity
i had a clear view
i was on top of the pole
do you mind if we see that again
help yourself the room is yours
but ive got thirty people on the set being paid for doing nothing
moving toward the door and calling come on burt youve got some reading to do
cameron follows eli as the lights go out and the film begins again
hey burt glad youre still alive considering who youre working for
cameron moves swiftly down the corridor behind eli who starts up the stairs still blithely chewing his gum
why are you lagging
im trying to figure it out
where was i
how tall is king kong
three foot six
i got all kinds of versions
wanna go back and see some
cameron understands the implied threat and eli knowing he has made his point continues good humoredly
ive even got a version where you fly the helicopter and im driving the duesenberg
its a dilly
a they have now charged out of the building and are racing across the grounds toward the set
what about the version where i go over the bridge and die in the water
chewing gum hey kid what is this with you
that red dye must be eating through your scalp and affecting your brain
why would i want to hurt you
because you dont like my tatoo
i think its beautiful
i think its a major work that may rank with the edsel grill
now goddamnit i gotta go back and do my picture
will you take this thing and read
he holds the booklet out to him and it is very hard for cameron to reach out and take it
out of the corner of his eye he sees the fbi men leaving the building heading off in another direction
he stares at the booklet
softly i knew a guy
who stepped on a bouncing betty booby trap
stepping on it wasnt his problem
they explode when you step off
so all he could do was just stand there
it was getting light
if we didnt get out wed of been shot up
so we left
eli has been watching him thoughtfully
he had this screwy west texas accent i remember hey fellas
eli blows a bubble with his gum that pops on cue as though it were the explosion of the bouncing betty
grinning he sticks the booklet in camerons shirt pocket turns and walks off
sam catches up and walks beside him toward the set
why dont you let the kid go before he gets hurt
chuck keeps an eye on him
hes dangerous to have around
stop playing games eli
tell jake youve replaced him
what are you so hooked on
he helps me understand the kid in our story
hes like one of those land mines left over from a war that go off from time to time
you read about it in the paper two or three years later
some kid in a bell tower shoots a dozen students for no reason at all
his mother says he was always such a good boy
i guess id like to know what he really did
as they reach the set gabe the cameraman charges up
did you bring the tampax
raymonds still acting like hes got the curse
with black humor you suppose raymond knows how to drive a duesenberg
scattered about the room are suitcases a wardrobe trunk the almost completed packing for tomorrows departure
nina lies in bed staring into nothing cameron beside her
each is talking aloud to himself adrift in his private world unaware they have lost contact with the other
the room is semi dark except for the nightstand light on camerons side by which he studies the booklet eli gave him
it was so unnecessary
for christs sake im no shrinking violet
ive had my ass pinched black and blue by account execs for not showing enough enthusiasm for vitalis
but this from eli
it was so pointless
reading open all windows slowly to keep pressure from caving in the roof should an unexpected skid achieve aquatic consequences
thats kind of witty
still in her own world couldve handled it later on
it doesnt look so raunchy after its cut
maybe id of got them stoned
but for eli to trap them like that
eyes on the book beautiful
theres a second school of thought that says the first school is all wet
it says keep the windows rolled up tight and wait for the air bubble
say it was an accident
benefit of the doubt
but then to use me that way
like a gadget
why would eli do that
hes not a cruel man
not looking up hes not a cruel man
hes a crazy man
reading the water pressure at two hundred feet can crush a man into the size of an egg
he wants to get that on film
so hes gonna kill me
jumping out of bed what in gods name are you babbling about
its a rotten shame about your folks and your naked ass but dying always scared me a little okay
and you are beginning to scare me
youre talking like a wild man
did you know that eli almost strangled a man because he stopped the camera when burt got killed
what is going on in that head of yours
you take the word of some
i saw the bruises
and i saw eli that night when he had to tell burts brother on the phone
i saw the tears
she saw the tears
did you ask him what he was crying about
cause you can bet your sweet tits it wasnt over burt
he was crying over losing his fucking shot
to keep from exploding nina opens her luggage and furiously starts repacking
didnt they give i
tests in the army
what did you get
havent you figured out yet why hes working himself to death
what his film is all about
hes trying to tell people not to kill each other
and you know what
you want the shock of your life
i understand what the son of a bitch is saying and he may be right
which makes me what
minus twelve the dumb schmuck with a gun
that doesnt change the fact that hes crazy
if he had his way there wouldnt be a soldier left alive by morning
but all hes got on hand is me
i dont know if he is doing it consciously but its a hell of an idea
if he can really get it on film a genuine dumb fuck grunt cashing in before your very eyes i mean the real mccoy
thats gotta help his picture
then hes killed two birds with one stone
its got a nice logic
trouble is both birds are me
against her instincts nina is emotionally affected by what cameron says
id die if anything happened to you
the telephone rings
her head whips to look at it
it continues ringing but she doesnt move
its my father
i wont talk to him
youre all driving me crazy
i wont talk to him
cameron calmly picks up the phone
whispering tell them im not here
tell them anything
tell them im working
glancing at nina okay chuck
ill meet you in an hour
he hangs up for me
amazing how they keep secrets around here
he walks over to the still stricken nina and tenderly embraces her
she leans against him the trembling subsiding
what if i told you i wasnt going to do the stunt
id say fine
and what if i told you i was gonna get out of here tonight
and that i want you to come with me
upset and confused but theres just one more day of shooting
what if i cant wait
i have two more scenes
thats a shame
i could meet you
when he doesnt answer nina resorts to her last defense irrational anger
look dont do the stunt
if you believe elis a killer call the police
why are you doing this to me
thats all i need right now with all ive been through
for you to give me now or never ultimatums and tell me my director is insane
by now she is stalking about the room throwing things from one suitcase to another as cameron silently watches her
which stands alone like moby dick awaiting its victim
chuck and cameron appear from behind the car stalking it like it were the sunday special on a used car lot chuck the hearty salesman cameron the reluctant customer
look at this mother
ill bet these guys could build an arabian out of a jackass
you built a stunt man out of one
three days and youve already grown those big brass balls
jump up and down and let me hear em clang and then do me a favor and leave em home for this gag
yanks open the door theres just enough room in that duesenberg for a normal guy
cameron slides in show me how long you can hold your breath
cameron inhales deeply and chuck clicks his stopwatch
now look around
no roll bar in the roof
thats because the roof caving in really looks gassy on film
you got your protection in the back of the seat
if the roof goes too far you get your goddamn head down quick
you listening to me
nod your head
slapping cameron on back you got good lungs
buckles camerons seatbelt you got no shoulder harness because it would show on camera
so when you hit the water you brace yourself against the steering wheel
you couldnt break it loose with dynamite
you gettin light headed yet
cameron shakes his head no
keep your hands off the doors
youre leaving through the window
you lower them slowly as you sink to equalize the pressure
what are you waitin for
im not gonna be down there holding your hand
cameron lowering windows slower
when you hit bottom the windows are open and youre gonna make like a minnow
but first a little fresh air wouldnt hurt
you reach down under the seat and what do you know a respirator
make like youre reaching for it
therell be one there tomorrow
cameron reaches for the non existent respirator
no keep your face forward the camera is behind you and its still running
by this time camerons breath is giving out and hes struggling to hold it
you feel like your lungs are gonna burst
thats the way youre supposed to act like you feel
the moment that water gets above your nose you gotta look like youre drowning
burt wasnt so good at that
that knocks the wind out of cameron
he sure as hell convinced me
chuck clicks his stopwatch and scowls
defensively things happen crossin the street
if somethin goes cockeyed
screw the scene
get that mask on
theres enough oxygen to get you to china
rolls up the window well try it again
still panting let me catch my breath
what youll catch is a lungful of water
youre at the bottom of the river
you breathe when i goddamn tell you to breathe
the pupil tricking the teacher hey chuck you blind
cant you see ive got my respirator on
you just goddamn remember you dont have gills
a chuck has stalked over to the workbench and angrily picks up the phone which has been ringing incessantly over the last few lines
listens then yells to cameron elis at the police station
thats the best news ive heard
lets hope its a felony
he needs gabe
theyre lookin for a driver so im gonna take him
come on with me
climbing into the company car you and me are gonna talk about windows and oxygen and seat belts and things like that
and if youre a good boy and listen and dont be a smart ass maybe ill let you sit in the back seat with nina franklin
chuck already in the car is grinning
now hes even for the respirator bit
you might even get to hold hands
the police station comes into view seen through the window of the company car which slows as it moves toward the curb
eli sitting on the front stoop leans wearily against the stone lion
as he sees the car approach he moves toward it quickly opening the door almost before it stops
beckoning gabe nina
eli pulls gabe and nina toward the police station yelling back to cameron and chuck
you two better wait here
cameron watches them confused as they start up the steps toward the station house
i hate this damn it
couldnt you have done it without me
lets say you owe it to him
until two or three days ago i had a pretty good actor on my hands
next time you take out the clippers be a little humane make sure the guys got one to spare
furious what did you want me to do
take him in the back room and unzip his fly every time he fluffed a line
what else can i do for your film
just get your greedy little ass inside and make sure you give the performance of your life
icily this next number i dedicate to you
as the three enter
the station is old with a high sergeants desk and wooden benches against the walls
raymond beyond tears destroyed sits among the other refuse of the night derelicts stoned kids etc
on one bench is a sailor with that adenoidal look that betrays the weakness he tries to hide with his butch arrogance
jake in the doorway of his office savors the fact that he has finally nailed eli cross
eli captures the setup in a glance
then instant theater
he strides across the police station to raymond takes his head in his hands and kisses him smack on the mouth
vehemently whos better booby
him or me
gabe has come up behind a patrolman grabs him by the hips and starts humping like a dog in heat
the policeman shrieks in dismay and tries to escape but gabe trots along as if they were locked
throw some water on him quick
only way to get em apart
gabe is now distracted by the sight of the sailor who is agape with growing disbelief
gabe ogles him
look at the seafood
youre a humpy little number
then to raymond stamping his foot you nasty boy
you couldve died of mercury poisoning
the sailor leaps to his feet in horror screaming
jesus christ theyre all faggots
eli has stormed to the counter and slams his fist down on it furiously confronting jake
shouting im registering a complaint
thirty two members of my company got v
from your local virgins
the chamber of commerce didnt say anything about that in their brochure
you can stop clowning eli ive got a sworn complaint from this sailor
jabbing his finer in raymonds o
direction your man over there touched his genitals
she is snuggled against him tenderly her open mouth kissing his neck and cheek
raymond although aware of his desperate situation is too sick with self loathing to respond
you wouldnt know your anal invert from a hole in the ground
raymond makes bad jokes but theyre not illegal
christ youve seen us all on the set
cameron stands peering in through the big front window feeling once again betrayed
its like watching tv with the sound shut off
from here nina and raymond are very convincing
chuck leans against a lamppost smoking a cigarette as the charade goes on
eli now going full blast
my companys been pouring sixty thousand dollars a week into this place for which your mayor and governor seem very grateful
we paid enough in taxes and fees alone to buy you parking meters from here to the boardwalk
feeling its all going wrong everything i said in that statement is the flat ass truth
eli pays no attention knowing that hes got jake
he gestures toward nina embracing raymond
jake i got a very horny leading lady whos got an early call and would like to spend some time with her boyfriend before she makes night night
now can i please get em outta here before they really do something illegal
and in front of witnesses
its three oclock in the morning
the corridors are empty as the elevator door swings open and nina and eli step out and move down the hallway functioning on their last ounce of nervous energy
sorry i had to put you through that
i know it was humiliating
it was awful
i hated it
but you did save that mans life
yeah that was really nice of me
im a nice person
i just wish i had the strength to go to his room and break his spine
on the last day of filming the queen decides to come out of the closet
wouldnt that have made a lovely headline
you understand of course that the film wouldve been destroyed
doing that to me
eli whats wrong
just a little self indulgence
feel sorry for eli time
eli on the edge of nervous exhaustion is actually close to tears
im sorry but you know
its too goddamn much
whys everybody on my back
whens somebody gonna say there there eli
im really surrounded by friends allies and you
what else can i do for your film eli
wounded thats not fair
they have reached a turn in the corridor where each would go his separate way
whats not fair
getting my feelings hurt
when did i lose you to that soldier boy nina
that nice wholesome swell looking kid
wanted by every cop the fbi and god knows who else for god knows what crime
nina is paralyzed with shock
come on nina those blue eyes have bedazzled our little girl
for christs sake he reeks of blood
you sound as crazy as
she stops wryly as who
he thinks youre trying to
she cant say kill harm him
any number of people are trying to harm him
he walks off down the corridor
partly crated props and costumes luggage belonging to the departing film crew is piled against the wall and on shelves
in the cavernous half lit room cameron once again the coiled stealthy animal moves through the shadows among the racks of suitcases pulling them aside searching
discovering one he sets it on the floor
with a metal bar he breaks the lock and eagerly rifles the contents
then sensing a presence he turns
there stands nina at the base of the steps watching him
with only a glance to her he goes on with his search
howd you know i was down here
the desk clerk
he finds a wallet opens it getting to his feet triumphantly
how about that for luck
burts from idaho
no picture on the drivers license
cameron stuffs the wallet in his pocket moving along the row of suitcases
he pulls out a duffel bag unzips it shaking the contents on the floor
now with the open bag on his arm he goes along the row of costumes and props like a man in the supermarket stuffing in things he will need a
pair of hiking boots a couple of work shirts a heavy jacket
passing a shelf of bayonets he picks one out and throws it in the bag
quietly who are you
ignoring the seriousness name it
above the bayonets are army helmets
he tries one on
hey hows this
a world war one uh
what did they call em
flings a nurses uniform at her wanna be the nurse
a from some hospital props he grabs a wheelchair and shoves it toward her
you tell me this wouldnt work
a pretty nurse pushing a vet in a wheelchair
when we hit that roadblock wed have em crying like babies
quietly who the hell are you
somebody trying to stay alive
anybody that can get past the dogs and the quicksand
making a shrewd guess who did eli say i was
im asking you god damn
she has fiercely grabbed his naked shoulder
easy with that tatoo
it mighta lost me eli but it won me lt
emily schmidt the greatest boobs in southeast asia
and a very patriotic chick
so i got this tattoo for bucks
and when she saw this shoulder let me tell ya holy jesus
following which i got the clap from the lt
and hepatitis from the tattoo needle
you know what bothers me
i think emily is gonna be very offended by elis picture
nina cannot endure another moment of this charade
why do they want you
what did you do
elid tell you
i was a soldier
i did the same as everybody just one of the boys
emptied my m at any sound
dont know whether i killed gooks or cherries
the new kids from the states we call em cherries which they were for maybe fifteen minutes
the dry season is when it really breaks loose
you get very tired
its like falling asleep at the wheel
you close your eyes and it still goes on
youre killin them theyre killin you
couldnt tell ya now what was real except im here
we sense in him the fatigue he is describing then pushing aside that memory
hey once when things were rough and the grass ran out i shot the hell out of a water buffalo
he considers then passes judgment on himself actually i wasnt a bad soldier
better than most
got lotsa pretty ribbons
sort of like when i did that first stunt and everybody started clapping
nothing like a slap on the back to ruin a man blow his sense of proportion
so i got home
i guess i expected something
nothing fancy but
something you know
a free car wash double blue chip stamps extra time on the parking meter
i dont know
uh didnt seem too pleased
trying to hide a lot of pain in fact they acted like i was gonna start killing babies
she crosses to him deeply moved
i was supposed to get married run an ice cream parlor
picks up his suitcases i gotta go
b although theyre standing only a couple of feet apart he lifts his hand tentatively as if to wave goodbye
what about the roadblocks
ill go through the woods
dont you suppose therell be cops in the woods
i suppose there are cops in the woodwork
but what the hell
its a nice night
he starts to go lovers facing farewells have a gift for suspending time and nina speaks out unable to let him leave
ive always liked the woods at night
theyre very romantic
you can hunt for truffles
it might be such fun wed just keep going
cameron cant afford to fall for her softness
you said we
what about your two scenes
one of them is three pages of me making a tunafish salad for an american flyer in
and ive got to weigh that against losing the man i love
its a big decision
nina youre making me crazy
im a little crazy myself
i cant let you go and i dont even know who you are
suddenly the dam bursts and all self control is gone why are they chasing you
what have you done
what happens to me in the woods
will i need a bayonet too
c he stands there staring at her his face suddenly savage
after everything the lady is afraid of him
he picks up the duffel bag and moves for the door then turns on her punishing her with his words
the charge was attempted murder
i bashed this cops head in
it took the jury about two fucking minutes
it could of been worse
it could of been life
but the judge
he looked real nice at me and said you were a damn good soldier son
so he only gave me twenty years
you know how long i was in that prison nineteen months and then i was gone
i was gone
she stares in shock and horror
his anger is like ice
caught me breaking into a store
oh not to rob it
i went there to kill the bastard who owned it
d suddenly the ice turns to steam
his self control shatters like glass
there in the basement of a year old hotel before an audience of one cameron erupts spewing out the memory of his mortification and crucifixion
not without the silent resignation of jesus but with the howling rage of a mad dog
pluto with the rabies
it seemed like a good idea to twist his fucking head off
said i could be his partner when i got back
lyin son of a bitch was real sorry things were slack
slack my ass
he just didnt want me hangin around because he was bangin my old lady
so i go down and start bangin on his door
he starts pounding on the mirror hes closed
its two oclock in the morning
i want to smash his face in and hes closed
open up e camerons fist smashes his own face in the dressing table mirror
his reflection crazes and falls to pieces
screaming your hand
cameron holds up his fist to her shaking it in glee
that bright shiny front window went bye bye
reveling in his own insanity maybe hes screwin her behind the counter
i climb in there screamin where are ya
come out here and be a man
where are ya
behind that counter you son of a bitch
cameron kicks over the makeup table as though it were the counter
tubes and glasses shatter all over the floor
ya know whats behind that counter
the ultimate horror cream
and all that fuckin f there is a rainbow row of makeup jars and hair tints
he starts hurling them against the wall where they smash punctuating his speech with bursts of gooey color
and these little mickey mouse faces on the walls
with candy eyeballs
he pauses catching his breath as another image emerges from the swirl of memory
tense and frightened then
i see this thing glowing in the dark
i hit that floor so fast
christ i nearly swallowed my heart
that second i was sure
it was charlie
a cigarette butt some guy on a v
his panic subsides know what it was
it was the machine
that did it
that did it
me buried in shit being the damn good soldier the judge said i was yes sir people sitting there on their fat asses feedin their fat faces
can i have an extra cherry
can i have an extra cherry
cameron rips denises electric hair dryer from the wall and hurls it across the basement
i smashed that fucking fudge pot across the room smack into that shelf full of animals
and it starts raining pussycats and monkeys and kangaroo cookies like noahs ark
the hair dryer smashes against a shelf toppling ammunition boxes and bottles onto the carcass of a disassembled world war i airplane
the propeller topples and falls through a german recruiting poster and just out at the kaisers crotch
how long should a girl wait she says
for goddamn ever bitch camerons hands have come to rest on a metal laundry bin
he grips it and lifts it over his head
i picked up this fifty pound ice cream vat
flavor of the month
royal bavarian chocolate mist
and i started running with that son of a bitch
cameron starts running across the room and just as hes about to hurl it he collides with a jutting shelf which knocks him flat on his back
the shelf falls and thirty or forty one gallon paint cans cascade on top of him
it looks disastrous
nina runs to him terrified but before the last can has even come to rest cameron emerges from the pile of cans throwing them aside still thrashing and screaming as
he struggles to his feet
at the sight of him nina starts laughing
but cameron who has somehow managed to keep his grip on the laundry basket raises it over his head as if nothing has happened hurls the clothes bin screaming with
the effort camerons feet fly out from under him as if he had stepped in oil
in fact he has stepped in paint and lands flat on his ass in the green goo
nina bracks out an uncontrollable guffaw
bellowing its not funny
shamed nina runs to him
but as she reaches him her feet too are caught in the paint and she slides forward like an ice skater spraddling him landing on her ass
his rage vanishes as he points at her breaking into a fiendish uncontrollable cackle
these pratfalls are a catharsis that has released the pressure and the madness
they attempt to gain their feet skidding and sliding in the paint
he succeeds but nina fails
through laughter let me go to the bathroom
im gonna have an accident
youll miss the main part
killer camerons ghastly crime
i was freaked out of my head
and suddenly theres this big flashlight shining in my face
i just grabbed that goddamn ice cream bucket and slopped it
right over the guys head
although camerons got nothing in his hands he pantomimes swinging that fifty pound ice cream bucket around in the air losing his balance and landing on his back in the
paint beside nina
her hysteria is renewed but cameron stops laughing
quietly its not funny
it wasnt him
it was a cop
i got out of there like a shot
i didnt know he was knocked out
how the hell did i know he was gonna lay there all night with his head in the ice cream
suddenly serious oh my god
no hes in the hospital
that ice creams goddamn cold
struggling for a proper description his nose
it froze and his ear froze see
despite the horror of it nina starts giggling
she cant help it
indignantly no its terrible
he lost the tip of his nose and his ear lobe
h then cameron realizing the absurdity starts giggling too
out of control nina scrambles to her feet and dashes for the ladies room
cameron follows her to the door still talking as it closes behind her
ill tell ya its a bad year to mess with cops
you get the fbi screaming down on your ass
through the door oh god
thanks a lot
abruptly camerons energy is gone
the hilarity is over
he leans his forehead against the door in exhaustion and despair
softly if we woke up eli and told him about the ice cream
would he forgive me and call off the stunt
the duesenberg stands silhouetted in the darkness light glinting dimly off it like the gleam from fine wood of a splendid coffin waiting in the slumber room before services begin
behind it a side door of the garage opens
but it is not visitors coming to pay their last respects it is cameron and nina
he is wearing burts clothes
nina moves quickly to a white convertible as cameron crosses to the big overhead garage doors and hits the electric switch
he flips another switch and harsh overhead lights illuminate the reality of the garage
nina has started the convertible as cameron tries to lift the garage door handles
how the hell dya open this thing
sorry folks its locked
cameron whirls towards the voice
a cop with a big flashlight stands in the open doorway peering in at them
we know its locked
would you open up for us
not til seven oclock
the actress im sure mr
cross will understand when you tell him that miss franklin had a sudden desire for swedish pancakes for breakfast and this gentleman had a sudden desire to keep me company
im nina franklin the star of the film
pancake house dont open til eight
thats all right well find some place
towns closed up pretty tight this time of night
then well drive to cape long
yall never get through the roadblocks
cross didnt want any members of the company leavin town tonight
guess he wanted everybody good and rested for the last day
he grins figure its no secret about the chief hopin this is the last day
fiercely are you telling me that if i decide to take a drive at any time of the day or night or whenever i damn please i need mr
cross does not control me or anyone else including this gentleman and he does not control the public roads
no but the police do

ill get em to rustle somethin up for you
maybe not pancakes but eggs if you want it
i think the lady had her heart set on pancakes but thanks
you change your mind call
ill be around
the officer is gone and so is their plan
theyre in limbo
people in a waiting room whose flight has been cancelled
i cant believe it
the son of a bitch knows whatever im thinking
im beginning to feel like something that sam wrote
im not real
im some jerk american flyer from world war i who has to go over a bridge and die because the goddamn script says so
im trapped in his goddamn story
if somebody lost that page id be fine
if he crossed it out and wrote something else like at the last moment he veers the big car from the railing then goes speeding on to live happy ever
he looks at the duesenberg appraisingly then grins as a plan starts to form how about that
empty road me out there all alone the crew way back breathless as i approach the bridge
hey what happened
a fucking rewrites what happened
ill have a fifteen minute jump on them before they figure out theyre shooting a new version
nina has come to life her eyes aglow like a shrewd little girl whos already decided how the fairy tale will end
and what about the love story
what happens to the austrian girl
people will leave the movie feeling terrible
she goes with him
nina has walked around to the back of the duesenberg and opens the in here
cautiously not bad
but i think they arrange to meet later
like in a greyhound bus station a couple of towns away
she climbs in see how big it is
honestly honey its a better ending
firmly nina get out of the trunk
the pretending has ended
and what happens in the morning
do i show up on the set in my little pink pinafore and say hi eli
wheres my hug and kiss
how do i do that now
sternly get out of the trunk
or should i trot up to my room to catch a couple of winks and cuddle up with a dozen sleeping pills
angry its my nightmare
this isnt the time to solve your neurotic problems
im trying to stay alive
shouting back so am i
and i never claimed not to have neurotic problems
interrupting oh for christs sake
they come with the body
its all one
a package deal
the shouting ends
and in despairing silence voices of approaching workmen are heard grumbling that the coffees late
urgent whisper nina please theres somebody coming
get out of the trunk
as we glimpse the workmen in the doorway she reaches up grabs the inside of the trunk lid and pulls it down disappearing from sight as the trunk slams shut
in the stillness as the morning sun crests the trees their shadows move like a parting curtain leaving sunlight to warm the old stones of the abandoned road
the ancient bridge spans the black river idling toward the sea
it is a perfect day tranquil except for the faint distant rumbling intruding into our consciousness
as it grows louder and louder a flock of birds is frightened from the trees a rusty beer can by the roadside begins to tremble and roll from the vibration
rounding the bend of the road into view are a half dozen kids on bicycles peddling furiously laughing and yelling and looking back at what now appears behind them the
first vehicle of an incredible carnival parade or is it a funeral procession
long short tall fat vehicles the stretch out car the cab towing portable toilets the tractor pulling a generator rig the cortez camper dressing rooms the stake bed loaded with
reflectors rattling like radar screens panel trucks with studio emblems a vintage german army truck filled with soldiers patrol cars and motorcycles the huge bright yellow construction crane on its caterpillar treads its pneumatic snout jutting forward thirty yards like a morning hard on sniffing around for some tunnel to hump a few technicians straddle it having their morning danish and coffee
in the midst of these on a low slung flatbed trailer rides the duesenberg the coffin on its caisson
the caravan grinds hisses wheezes to a halt and the a
astride the hood of the first vehicle dismounts and raises his electric bullhorn to begin what will be an incessant squawking of instructions reprimands coaxings and complaints
all right people
the rest period is over
another fifteen minutes and we start losing sun
come on lets get the equipment off those trucks
the second a
s run around like sheepdogs herding the laborers snapping at their flanks barking their instructions over electric horns
chuck barton where do you want the duesenberg
grips and laborers are carrying the big reflectors through the brush into the hills
the camera crews ready for a setup
they are already huddled squatting on their haunches under a tree
the r in the chopper on the maxi mount the underwater imo in the duesenberg
ill hide an arri with a zoom up on the hill
and what about number four
maybe hang a platform under the bridge with the speed camera
from the top of the screen right into the water
being rolled up to a mark in the center of the road
crewmen swarm in and under it tuning polishing testing installing camera sound electrical equipment as chuck hovers over them
all drivers please
i want every equipment vehicle back behind the bend
as motors rev the two sheepdogs squawk out of sight
behind the bend
then are lost in the rising dust of their herd
cables are being strung out of sight along the side of the road snapped into junction boxes that spread their electrified tentacles strangling the landscape
pointing at the mike boom whats that supposed to be ralph
an elm or an oak
get that mike off the boom and into the bushes
come on people lets think
were losing the sun
gabe chuck the a
and a technician move down the road toward us shoulder to shoulder halting on the bridge
chuck and gabe move to the stone railing
chuck taps on it producing a hollow sound
gabe examining a corner of this false section
have em touch up that corner of the section
it looks phony as hell
has been drawing a chalk line across the road
to technician climb down there in the bushes and stay out of sight
what about earphones
just watch your mark
behind it the last of the equipment trucks is being jack knifed out of sight
a row of reflectors stand like sentinels on the hill bathing the duesenberg in light
workmen swarm about it like ants on the queens birthday
into walkie talkie wheres the chopper
wed kinda like to have you join us
if you can find the way
over walkie talkie fifteen minutes eli
were just warming her up
eli grabs an electric horn from the hand of a passing a
all right everybody
may i have your attention please
instantly the frantic a
s begin squawking everybody put down what youre doing the director wants to talk
thru speaker this is the one and only duesenberg we have in stock
when that car goes into the water were not going to see it again
so once the action starts no matter what happens keep it going
as cameron steps out through the open doorway buttoning his costume
we must have this shot
therefore i now order no camera to jam and no cloud to pass before the sun
as cameron moves toward it uncertainly
eli some distance away surrounded by members of his crew glances up
yelling how ya doin soldier
whered ya learn to do without sleep
without awaiting an answer eli returns to his work as cameron approaches the duesenberg
cameron walks around it testing and checking but moving relentlessly toward the humpback trunk
a horn honks and a police car slides up
jake leans out the window waves at cameron jovially
how do you guys get accident insurance
must cost you an arm and a leg
chuckling thats a good one
he drives on toward a parked german army truck in which lounge several soldiers
chuck approaches cameron
youre lookin real strong kid
is that loose change i hear jinglin or are they beginnin to grow
flatly wanna check
cmon lemme show you this truck
they walk towards the german truck
im sending it on ahead
during the gag its gonna be comin down the road towards you when you get to the bridge
cameron tenses at this information
relax what does it change
im only tellin you so you dont buzz off into space when you see em
theyll be shooting at you and thats whats supposed to make you go into the river
a theyve reached the truck where jake stands proudly
the property man is handing out rifles and boxes of bullets to the german soldiers whom we now recognize as police officers from the town
one cop tying his shoe lifts his head and grins at cameron like an old buddy the officer from the garage last night
hey you ever get those pancakes
cant recognize em
how could i say no after all the crap theyve taken because of this company the last six weeks
good naturedly yeah a copll do anything for fifty bucks even be an actor
these guns are kinda modern for world war i
to chuck you want me to drive back and get the old ones
how muchll they see from the helicopter
if cameron was upset by the change in the stunt he is now really unnerved by the sight of those cops with guns
the second cop is loading cartridges
starting back to duesenberg hope those are really blanks
chuckling dont say so on the box
as cameron arrives and casually leans against the trunk and then gently taps
he must get nina out of there
with determination he reaches for the trunk handle
arms wearing the same costume as his own reach in holding the trunk closed
it is raymond
no need to look
if she loves you shes still there
if she doesnt
then it doesnt really matter
how can he know
everything is out of control a voice calls
hey lucky we need you
he turns and moves numbly to the car door
get in will ya
dazed cameron climbs behind the wheel
leaning in passengers side look straight ahead can you see that red light out of the corner of your eye
a tiny red light is mounted in the corner over the windshield
thatll let you know when the films running so be sure you dont turn your face to the camera
the technician tightens a final screw on the red light then leaning back out of the car yells o
all right bump it once
to cameron does it work
cameron barely hearing looks straight ahead without response
jake lounges at the drivers window kibitzing the operation
bump it again
looks back into the car by reflex what
the words camera on sound exactly like cameron
it sounded as though his real name was called and he automatically answered
has his identity been exposed
his eyes widen
the technician getting no response calls to jake
ask him if its on
he whirls to see jake staring at him
his hand darts to the ignition key the engine roars to life
startled hey they wanna know is the camera cameron realizes his error but its too late hes in a panic
in his mind hes given himself away
the road ahead is clear go
he jams the car in gear and slams the accelerator to the floor
the duesenberg leaps forward screeching wildly
in its wake chaos
everyone running yelling
yelling that crazy bastard
who cued him
cold urgent roll
roll the film
move your asses i want that shot
at their masters voice they leap
screams end markers
the needle hits sixty five seventy climbing fast
cameron grips the wheel looking at that empty road
an involuntary shout swells up and escapes his mouth
toward nina in the trunk hang on to everything baby were on our way
the needle hits eighty eighty five
ahead the bridge is rushing toward us
now the arches of the stone railing are strobing past
through them he sees the black river which he has escaped
triumphantly his hand rises middle finger extended
suddenly the red camera light goes on the underwater camera behind him begins whirring
he moves his finger behind him for a perfect close up recalling that moment in the tower screaming shoot this eli
the center of the bridge is an instant away an approaching blur
crouching tensely watching the chalk line on the road as the duesenberg flashes past
his finger presses a button
the whole front wheel of the car is blown off by an explosive charge
the duesenberg drops on one axle
metal screams against stone as though it were cameron himself screaming
skidding spinning tearing through the papier mache railing plunging out of control into space where it hovers for a brief instant and arcs downward like a dying bird
a cry of such anguish and despair
screaming ninaaa a a a a
the river rushes up and the car smashes into it with a deafening shattering roar plunging beneath the surface to a dark and soundless world except for a tiny red
light the whir of a camera and camerons desperate cries
tearing his seatbelt off he flings himself toward the rear of the car clawing at the back seat to reach nina
incredibly there is sunlight again as the car is buoyed to the surface
there again is the living world the road the trees
in that brief instant through the rear window cameron has a wild tilted glimpse of a pink pinafore nina standing by the rail looking down eli beside her
the car noses downward water rising swiftly over the rear window
the last image on camerons retina is that wild eager little girl excitement on ninas face
then hes alone again entombed in the darkening water as the car plunges toward the bottom
cameron sits immobilized at the realization that his betrayal is total
everyone even nina has conspired to bring him to this red light glowing camera whirring to capture the moment of his death
outrage galvanizes him to action
he reaches for the door handles to rip them open they snap off in his hands
now there is a rumbling and rending of metal as the roof begins to implode crushing down toward him
under the immense pressure the rear window bursts inward the river rushing in a wild torrent
the memory of chucks voice
he lowers the front window slowly
the water now pours in faster
the level has risen to his chin
he gasps a final breath and the water rises over his head
still the red light burns
he reaches beneath the seat for the oxygen cylinder and tries to pull it loose
it wont move
the impact of the car hitting the water has bent the seat frame
his groping hand finds the hose the oxygen mask
though every second is robbing his chance for life his movements under water are as in slow motion
pulling the mask to his face he takes an eager breath and chokes as water fills his mouth
the rubber tube has broken loose from the cylinder and is floating free as it must have with burt
pressure of the onrushing water has stopped as the water reaches the roof
for a moment there is a strange stillness which cameron his lungs bursting swims through out the window and toward the surface
moving upward through river slime in a world that grows lighter in a desperate race to reach air
gasping half unconscious barely able to move his arms to stay afloat
adrift in the current he touches land clawing at the rocks and pulling himself onto the shore
his muscles still moving by motor reflex driven by survival instinct take him crawling from the river bank through the tall grass still the fugitive the man on the run
then he lifts his head and stops at what he sees before him fanned out across the field is a row of men guns held ready
policemen from the truck in their german uniforms moving forward slowly carefully searching the terrain in an arch which as it closes must irrevocably reach cameron
without strength or will he lies waiting for them as though his eyes were made of glass
they see him now but their pace doesnt change
as they take the last few steps toward him he sees their shoulders waists knees and then only a circle of feet around him
their hands roughly grab him pulling him to his feet shoving him brutally about
angry cop faced growling kill the son of a bitch shoot im cut it hang im and then loudly cut it
he feels a blow on the back then another
they seem too gentle
why is that cop smiling
some of them are walking away
where are the handcuffs
why is he shaking my hand instead
then the jumble of voices is becoming clearer
no matter what they pay you make em give you a raise
fantastic my wife thinks being a cop is dangerous you guys are terrific
it finally sinks in the insane absurd devastating humiliating realization that it was all just another scene in a movie that came off as planned
he is alive and free
is that gurgle we hear in camerons throat the water that he swallowed or an unseemly giggle
then it chokes into laughter
here comes chuck running across the field with his silly stunt bag filled with elastic bandages
heres the helicopter hovering with gabe descending the rope ladder bearing film for eli who runs to meet him
theres the pink pinafore
nina holding the skirt up to her waist as she wades through the tall grass towards him
how sweetly absurd
all right come on
lets get the stuff in the trucks were losing sun
chuck has reached cameron throwing a blanket over him
he pulls a pint from his back pocket
take a belt
dont be stingy
as cameron tilts his head back the bottle to his mouth he sees skin divers setting down their rescue equipment and stripping out of their dripping wet suits
those guys down there the whole time
chuck who is rubbing cameron violently through the blanket to restore his circulation replies with the highest compliment he can pay
i cant hear ya
theyre clangin too loud
nina has reached an impasse twenty yards away in her journey of love toward cameron a muddy section of swamp
shouts across the distance to cameron i cant come any further
what should i do
ill get the dress all muddy and i need it for the next scene
grinning with good nature tunafish salad
shouts they found me five minutes after you left
i felt ridiculous
waves back just as well
shouts when eli told me youd changed your mind and decided to do the stunt at first i didnt believe him but i guess you really did
i tried to find you
eli is standing nearby listening to this macabre exchange between lovers
to include eli im sure glad you two made up
boy lucky were you wonderful
i guess i have to go now
see you after
she awkwardly turns her dress still held high and yells back over her shoulder
im sorry i was so nutty last night
i always get crazy at the end of a film
nina continues picking her way toward the road
suddenly she turns running headlong pell mell across the swamp and through the mud holes drenching her pink pinafore into a muddy rag losing a shoe ripping her hose and
then wildly into the arms of cameron smearing him with love and mud
and then just as quickly she is gone racing back across the field hopping like a rabbit without her shoe toward the road
cameron is brimming with pleasure
chuck totally ignored picks up his stunt bag
dryly lover i think your circulations back to normal
and please next time will ya listen for the cue the word is action
he walks off leaving cameron draped in the blanket like an indian
eli steps up to him looking very serious lifts his hand in the indian sign of greeting and says how
i have always had a great compassion for your people
long before it was popular i felt a repugnance for general custer
cameron stares at him incredulous
my god i think hes breathing
therere days i cant do anything right
i hope this doesnt screw up our relationship your being alive and all
shaking his head you sure took a hell of a chance eli
why didnt you just let me go last night
what with nina in the trunk
ive got scenes to shoot with her
this morning then
chuck could have done the stunt
thoughtfully i knew a guy who made an anti war film
when they previewed it in his hometown army enlistment went up six hundred percent
im making this film trying to convince the whole world that maybe theres a better way to get home for thanksgiving
and i cant even convince one dumb kid with a tattoo
i couldnt have you run around paranoid the rest of your life thinking i was trying to kill you
sam has run up out of breath followed by crew members
hey sam the kid just licked your screenplay
he named the disease
a social disease very common
its spread the same way
by screwing your fellow man
i hope you find an easier cure
that was the hardest thousand bucks i ever made
a horn honks
it is jake who in his enthusiasm has driven the police car bumping over the marshes to eli and cameron
you guys want a ride back
moving toward the helicopter no were goin in the chopper
considers it thanks eli but that looks too dangerous
i think ill ride with jake
good luck with the picture
he moves toward police car
yelling to cameron dont miss that plane burt
leaning across cameron to yell at eli he better not
any member of your company found within city limits after five oclock tonight gets shot on sight
eli stops suddenly registering what cameron had said
what thousand bucks
that stunt paid six fifty
surprised chuck told me a thousand
firmly six fifty
getting upset a thousand
relenting okay seven fifty
split the difference
youre trying to screw me
youre doing it again
striding toward the chopper shouting sam
this paranoid little bastard still doesnt understand your damn screenplay
eli is climbing into the helicopter
shrieking thats your big problem eli
you use people
i want my money a thousand bucks
to cameron six fifty
to sam rewrite the battle scene and let the tank run him over
the stunt pays six fifty
the helicopter takes off zooms under the bridge up into a hammerhead and soars back while cameron continues to scream at it
come back here
im tired of being your goddamn clown
pay me my thousand bucks
elis voice on the helicopters p
speaker echoes through the canyon as the chopper cavorts overhead and skims away
how tall was king kong
