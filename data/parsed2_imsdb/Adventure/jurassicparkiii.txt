href b b jurassic park written by peter buchman revisions by alexander payne jim taylor and john august a speedboat cuts swiftly through the ocean swells beneath the looming cliffs
of isla sorna
illegal costa rican parasail operator enrique cardoso helps americans ben hildebrand and twelve year old eric kirvy already wearing life vests strap themselves into a two person parasail harness
ben and eric clamber onto a makeshift platform that hangs over the back of the board
dangling from bens neck is a camcorder
you make sure to get us as close as you can okay
if its a good trip ill give you a little extra
i take you close
but not too close
rubbing erics head you dont want them to eat you
enrique heads toward the drivers seat and a large second hand winch bolted to the deck
ben and eric nod excitedly and give the thumbs up
ben lifts the camcorder to the record the action
enrique jams the down the throttle down and with a loud raor the speedboat shoots forward
soon the boat is whipping across the rolling ocean
strapped together ben and eric lean back over the passing water intently watching for enriques signal
as the boat picks up speed enrique eyes the speedometer
ben grabs the end of the ripcord attached to the harness
he and eric braces themselves
enrique finally signals with a pulling motion
he pulls the winch ben yanks the cord and wooosh
a brightly colored parasail blossoms behind the boat hoisting ben and eric aloft
in a big block letters on the parasail is stitched dino soar
the townline unsold rapidly from its enormous reel
ben and eric climb higher and higher
enrique keeps an eye on the clients
when they reach a certain height he locks off the reel
high overhead ben and eric are floating in wonderful quiet splendor
the motor of the boat now sounds strangely distant
down below the boat enters a think blanket of fog
eric points excitedly at the islands as ben films him with the camera
then a sudden tug on the thing line cause ben to drop the camera which now dangles from his neck
what was that
a second tug
and now the faintest of screams
ben and eric look down to find that the boat has disappeared into the low bank of fog
by the time the boat emerges on the far side of the mist
their is no sign of enrique
the deck is splattered with blood
as ben considers the driverless boat
ben glances over at eric staring in horror at something below
following his gaze ben finds that their boat is only moments away from crashing into a large reef
sticking out of the water the imposing reef is being battered by waves
as the boat smashes into the reef it splinters into a number of pieces
a panicked ben turns to eric
unclip your line
eric and ben frantically unclip their lines
catching an updraft the parasailers float upward
a strong wind sends them wafting over the daunting cliffs of isla sorna
two plastic dinosaurs enter the frame and do battle accompanied by a childs ferocious sounds
charlie a three year old boy plays in a sandbox with his favorite toy dinosaurs
alan grant squats next to him and watches with great delight
ellie satler stands over them an infant in her arms a picture of the perfect family
oh actually charlie those two are herbivores
they wouldnt be interested in fighting each other
picking up two other dinosaurs see these are carnivores
and this one here see its claws this one here uses its claws to gouge at the throat of its opponent
as grant demonstrates with some grunt and groans of his own he only succeeds in frightening the boy
interrupting uh alan
why dont you wait till hes a little older
back to charlie happy dinosaurs
he bounces them along the sandbox edge
then the sound of a car engine turning off and a door slamming is heard
that must be mark
calling out mark were back here
ellie and grant turn to see mark degler coming through the gate carrying a briefcase
hes their age handsome but not annoyingly so with a friendly balance demeanor
he and ellie kiss tenderly on the lips
keeping the world safe
re baby here let me take her
ellie hands off the baby
mark this is alan grant
nice to meet you alan
ive heard a lot about you
the two men shake hands and we now realize it is grant who is the stranger in this household
little charlie runs to his father showing his dinosaur
daddy this is a herbabore
grant smiles uncomfortably a third wheel
winden to a parrot in a large cage
grant is teasing the bird with a cookie holding a it just out of reach
whats my name
come on jack say it
is my name alan
say my name
the bird doesnt respond
he used to know me
sorry alan its been six years
grant shrugs gives jack the cookie and heads towards the table
the three adults are finishing their dessert and coffee
the the children have been out to bed
an awkward moment of silence
then more coffee
mark stands and collects their cups
so marks working at the state department now
to mark what do you do there
with mock bravado i could tell you about it but than id have to kill you
mark smiles nodding
then he goes into the kitchen
another uncomfortable silence
so what are you working on now
we have a new site in montana
at least until the money runs out
grant leans forward realizing ellies one of the few people he can talk to about this
you remember the sounds they made
i try not to
weve done cranial scans and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber
i have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence
the way they can work together as a team
you think they could talk to each other
to a degree we never imagined
and from the cage in the corner of the room
both look back at the parrot
you taught him that
ellie and grant head toward the rental car parked in the driveway
good luck with the fund raising
it was never easy but before jurassic park you could find money
now fossils are out
everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur
times change alan
but youre the still the best
i mean that
the last of my breed
a long moment passes between them as both consider where theyve ended up
id better get going
let me know if i can help alan
youre bad about asking for help but please ask me
deep down knowing he never will okay
not sure what the right thing to do is they finally end up with a friendly hug
they keep it short
grant gets in his car
starts the engine
hes about to pull off when ellie knocks on the window
he rolls it down
when i met you i thought that one day millions of years ago all the dinosaurs became extinct
but you told me otherwise
when conditions changed dinosaurs changed
they became other things
a well accepted theory
simply alan dont be afraid to evolve
grant hears her but ellie knows it didnt really get through
a forced half smile than grant waves goodbye
ellie watches as he drives off
the last stop on grants fund raising tour its a public lecture hosted by some foundation
there are scientists and students here but also a lot of dino fans some even with costumes
grant finishes his speech to what was a full house some attendees are grabbing their coats and sneaking out
this wasnt the exciting guest speaker they were all expecting
a new slide comes up
just black and white and indecipherable
its through the painstaking study of the interior chamber in multiple specimens that we can determine this exciting correlation between the larynx and the upper plate
that lets us theorize theorize mind you that the raptor might have been capable of bird like vocalizations
which as you can imagine would be a tremendous breakthrough
hes finished but no one seems to notice at first
then the sympostum leader stands up leading a smattering round of thank you very much dr
now does anyone have a question
nearly every hand goes up
grant doesnt seem surprised
does anyone have a question that doesnt relate to jurassic park
quite a few hands go down
grant contd or the incident in san diego which ill remind you i did not witness
now most of the hands are down
picking one of the few remaining
your theory on raptors is good and all but isnt all this conjecture kind of moot
the students buddy nods in agreement
i mean once the u
and costa rica and everyone decides how to handle the second island scientist will just go in and look for themselves
isnt paleontology itself in danger of extinction
recognizing those as fighting words the symposium leader is about to step in
but grant will take this himself
no and let me be perfectly clear on this point
dinosaurs lived million years ago
whats left of them is fossilized in stone the actual scientists spend years to undercover
what john hammond and ingen created are theme park monsters
nothing more nothing less
the class clearly disagrees with his assessment
youre saying you wouldnt want to study them if you had the chance
no force on this earth or in heaven could get me on that island
looking through the cracked windshield of a junkyard plane we see someone spray painting red circles on the outside of the glass
nash a wry intelligent mercenary pilot and soldier is painting huge eyes the windows of a wrecked plane
finished he tosses the paint can through the open windows and walks quickly away from the plane
we now see that red teeth are painted on the crafts nose
it looks absurdly like some angry beast
we are one the edge of a dry lake bed part of an aircraft graveyard
wrecked planes lie all around
we hear a phone ringing
a ringing satellite phone rests on a stack of gun cases
udesky the leader of this crew answers it
beat yes sir
were good to go
ill lock it down as soon as you drop me the payment
with the phone still to his ear udesky wanders out of the craft
udesky looks over at nash and cooper another mercenary
coopers the quiet muscle of the bunch a weapons specialist
he finishes loading a massive gun essentially a hand cannon
its aimed at nashs grimacing aircraft
thats right two of the very best i could find
no i havent worked with them personally but they come with the highest recommendations
then cooper fires at the grimacing aircraft
a projectile rockets into the plane and explodes with a fireball
nash and cooper exchange a satisfied smile
youve got nothing to worry about sir
this is going to be a piece of cake
pieces of the demolished craft come raining down
close on a mans hand carefully scraping the stone away from a dinosaur fossil
we follow his hand back as he wipes off his sweaty brow revealing him to be billy brennan an associate professor and site manager
hes a charmer
looking past him we see cheryl a junior at junior of state
shes one of a dozen college students working at the site and the one most smitten with her supervisor
i dont think im doing this right
he scoots over lying down beside her
checks her work
you need to go slowly
see just take it little at a time
shes not listening just watching his eyelashes
i can never tell whats bone and whats rock
technically its all rock
the calcium in the bones is replaced during fossilization
but you can feel the difference
he runs her bare fingers over the two different patches showing her
after a pause she runs her finger along his stubbly chin
and along his lips
cheryl contd smooth
billy may not have started this flirtation but hes not ending it either
its then that a falls across them
billy looks up to see
grant has just returned a bag over his shoulder
billy takes one of grants bags talking as they go
how was your trip
well be broke in four weeks
i had to rent some equipment
the cross into one of the tents which only has two walls
on a dust taped table a dusty macintosh is feeing data into a strange machine the size of a dorm refrigerator
a mechanical arm sweeps back and forth across a tray of fine sand
you rented an automated litter box
its a rapid prototyper
i feed in the scan data from the raptor skull than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints one layer on top of the other
its the future of paleontology
not if it cant dig
the arm stops and suddenly the tray of sand shakes dropping through holes in the bottom to reveal an object the size of a persons fist
i give you a raptors resonating chamber
grant hates technology but he cant help but be amazed by the result
he lifts the strange object up shaking out the remaining sand
billy puts it to his lips and blows through it like a conch shell
the resulting sound is unique and piercing the cry of an non existent animal
grant is speechless with excitement
and so he uses it again and again producing different sounds and variations
in the distance flocks of birds rise to the sky and fly off
billy looks up to see a man and a woman getting out of a cadillac
cheryl is pointing them in the direction of the tent
billy contd falsely casual oh i forgot to tell you
some visitors wanted to come by and talk to you
i told them youd be happy to see them
maybe even have dinner with them
only now does grant realize these two people who were walking up to them
putting on a friendly smile billy goes up to them
extending his hand paul kirby
kirby enterprises reaching into his pocket my card
paul kirby is a talkative optimist with no off switch
his wife amanda kirby just as friendly is harder to read
there seems to be exhaustion behind her eyes
what can i do for you mr
well sir i am a great admirer of yours and i have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss
would you let my wife and i take you to have dinner tonight
you know ive been traveling and im very tired
maybe some other time
i guarantee itll be worth your while
behind kirby bill furtively rubs his thumb and fingers together indicating the guy is loaded
grant musters a weak smile
its be my pleasure
theyre only halfway through the entree but grant is ready to bolt
its only billy whos keeping him from being rude
they walk over to paul and amandas table and sit down
first off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts amanda and i have admired your work for years
it is truly whats the word
its everything grant can do just to be polite
he desperately wants to leave and get back to his dig
amanda and i well we just love the outdoors
heck weve been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with galapagos k the nile
we even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight
billy nudges grant
now for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special something
he places his hand on his wifes
once in a lifetime
weve arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over isla sorna
and we want you to be our guide
the kirbys look to grant as if theyve offered him an amazing gift
but grant just sighs and smooths the tablecloth
thats a very nice offer mr
kirby but im afraid im much to busy
if you like i can refer you to a number of highly qualified
no no see dr
grant youre the best
youve seen these animals in the flesh
no one else has come close to you
im flattered but ive taken this little adventure tour
and with the air restrictions theyve imposed after the incident in san diego you cant fly low enough to see anything of interest
paul is momentarily stymied but amanda rallies
you see thats just the thing
paul and i have special permission to fly low
well im no aviation specialist
but i do know its hell of a lot lower than anyone else
from what i understand its pretty much whatever we want
thats hard to believe
lets just say that through my business imports exports emerging markets ive made some friends in high places
in this case the costa rican government
grant you dont know how important it is for us to have you come along
it would make all the difference
grant is trying to find another way to say no when paul pulls out his checkbook
and of course were prepared to make a sizeable contribution to your research here
billy looks at grant
dont say no
paul contd i can write all kinds of numbers on this check
just tell me what exactly it would take
we hold on a conflicted dr
a small airplane a beechcraft kingair turboprop to be exact cruises through clear blue skies
grant re settles trying to get comfortable
billy is across from him finishing cleaning his camera lenses before putting them back in the ragged case
even with what i pay you you could get a better bag
this is lucky
couple years ago some buddies and i went hang gliding off these cliffs in new zealand
updraft sent me right into the side
that does sound lucky
it was this strap alone that saved my life
got caught on a rock as i was falling
survival of the most idiotic
because he hasnt really said it
listen alan i really appreciate you bringing me along
the bones will be there when we get back
thats the nice thing about them
they never run away
beat and besides you got me into this
i dont intend to be alone with these people
sitting near the front of the plane
paul draws a long nervous breath and looks at amanda
she seems just as tense
finally finding a comfortable position grant puts his hat over his eyes ready to take a nap
done with his camera billy turns to someone just off screen
so how do you know the kirbys
and we reveal
mercenary cooper the weapons specialist we met earlier
hes wearing sunglasses so dark you cant tell whether hes staring at you or fast asleep
he doesnt answer
did he even hear
and then through our church
the one that worships god and believes in being good
the plane continues onward
grant slowly wakes in his chair groggy
all the other passengers are fast asleep
then grant turns to his right
sits besides him
the dinosaur eyes him curiously then opens his mouth
and than it strikes
grant wakes up with a start disoriented
billy is leaning over him
were almost there
the adrenaline still surging through him grant turns and looks clouds obscure the view than parts reveal rising majestically out of the water
we watch the plane descend sharply to the island
in various combinations grant and billy paul and amanda look out the windows at the amazingly green island
cooper looks out through a window of his own
here we find the rest of the crew from the junkyard
nash is piloting
a voice comes over their radio headsets
spanish accent unidentified aircraft approaching isla sorna this is san juan approach
you are flying in restricted airspace
immediately turn to the coordinates two zero zero
i repeat redirect to
a look from nash then udesky switches off the radio
the plane now descends to a mere hundred feet above the treetops
paul puts his hand atop amandas as they stare intently out the window
billy looks to grant
grant will admit nothing
calling back from the cockpit
yell up if you see anything
yelling back no i thought id keep it to myself
suddenly grant spots
look at the coloration
an apatosaur is grazing on the grass
amazed im so use to seeing bones
its weird to see skin
if you look out the right you can see
but paul just waves him away with a hand staring intently out his window
we hold on grant a moment thinking that odd
udesky puts down his binoculars
south shore is clear
the rest is rock
are we on
looking out the window grant notices theyre flying awfully low
just then he hears a mechanical hum and a low rush from outside
now wanting to believe thats not the landing gear
paul amanda and cooper dont respond
realizing you cant land
paul turns back to him
grant if youd just sit tight well explain this all in a jiffy
this plane can not land
its going to be all right
grant is out of his seat heading for the cockpit
hell wrestle the controls if he has to
cooper grabs him pulling him back
grant starts to struggle but hes certainly no match
a well practiced fist hits him dead on
we hear amandas voice strangely distant but amplified
are you there honey
her calls continue as we fade up to
blurry and disorientated
he finds himself lying on the floor of the plane
seeing him come to billy helps him slowly get up
grants head is pounding
tell me we didnt land
by his expression we see billy would have to lie
i think theyre looking for someone
the jungle has almost reclaimed this patchy vine covered runway
the airplane is parked at one end
nash udesky and cooper are checking their weapons
amanda is at the edge of the tarmac calling into the jungle on a billy and a groggy grant emerge from the airplane
paul trots over
grant are you alright
im sorry we had to be so
the three mercenaries are now walking into the jungle with their guns
what the hell is going on
what are they doing
establishing a perimeter
making it safe
these guys are really good
one of them was a green
kirby trust me on this island there is no such thing as safe
we have to get back in this plane
grant looks to amanda who shouts through a bull horn
on bullhorn and tell your wife to stop making so much noise
were food to these damn animals
yelling amanda honey
grant says its a bad idea
on the bullhorn what
pointing broadly at alan he says its a bad idea
on the bullhorn whats a bad idea
as in on cue there is a deafening roar from the jungle
everyone turns toward the sound and freezes
to alan what was that
grant doesnt answer still listening to the reverberations
then a couple shots are heard
low is it a rex
i dont think so
billy and paul breathe a small sign of relief
nash and udesky come running out of the jungle headed for the plane
we gotta go now
whats the problem
cant you guys
as udesky and nash sprint past paul in interrupted by a second closer deafening roar
udesky waits by the door hustling everyone inside
nash hurries into the cockpit
everyone scrambles to a seat
amanda climbs next to paul
we cant just
dont worry honey
well circle around and come back
udesky closes the door
what about the other guy
coops a professional
he can handle himself
a blood curdling scream echoes through the jungle followed by yelling back were going
udesky climbs into the copilots seat and nash revs the engine
the plane starts down the runway
the passengers bounce in their seats as the plane picks up speed down the overgrown strip
suddenly two hundred yards ahead of the plane emerges from the jungle
he stands in the middle of the runway
waving one arm wildly
his second badly injured arm hangs limp by his side
come on nash
slow down buddy
nash spots cooper shoots a glance at the airspeed indicator
coop you know i cant do it pal
he slams down full throttle in an attempt to reach flying speed
seeing that nash has no intention of stopping paul shouts from the cabin
what are you doing
we are looking down on cooper from behind
as the plane approaches falls over the injured mercenary
then with brutal speed an enormous beast seizes him in its massive jaws and lifts him into the air
from this angle we get only a glimpse of a long crocodilian snout powerful clawed forearms and spiny sail rising from the creatures back
all eyes are on the creature as it devours cooper
amanda turns away in horror
oh my god
paul my god
looking through the windshield we see the creature is directly in the path of the plane
nash pulls back on the stick
the plane rises
the left propeller clips the flank of the enormous dinosaur snapping the blade
blood sprays the windshield and side windows
the turboprop banks into the jungle out of control
the passengers are thrown about as the craft crashes through trees tearing off a wing and pieces of the tail
finally coming to rest in the jungle canopy the plane settles in the trees
the passengers slowly recover and have a look around
foliage blocks most windows making it impossible to see out
is anyone hurt
checking themselves everyone seems pretty much intact
still thinking of himself as in charge
lets everybody just stay put
he attempts to turn on the cockpit radio but its dead
whos got the sat phone
paul hands the bulky phone up to nash who dials out
grant unstraps himself climbs to the back to the side door and shoves
the door opens a few inches before hitting a branch
he looks out the and lets out a quiet gasp as the ground reels he quickly shuts and latches the door
close on the sat phone
pressed against nashs ear
all circuits are busy
please try your call again later
what is it
whats the matter
a huge reptilian face appears in the cockpit window
everyone else screams now
the plane lurches and we hear a deep growl
the passengers hold tight paralyzed
nash buckles himself into his seat
suddenly the plane is yanked from the side to side
battered this way and that the terrified passengers tightly grip their seats
finally the horrible sounds of wrenching metal as the nose of the plane is ripped right off
nash and udesky are suddenly sitting in open air
the nose of the plane is tilting downwards the jungle floor far below
the passengers hang almost vertically in their seats debris tumbles out the open end of the plane some of it striking nash in the head
udesky unbuckles his seat belt and climbs back up into the cabin
suddenly a long snout with dagger like teeth pushes past the cockpit seats opens wide and on nashs legs
the pilot cries out in agony
the others passengers grab onto his arms trying to pull him back
but its no use
the dinosaur rips nash out of their grasp and down the aisle
nash desperately grabs on to the seat cushion then watches in horror as the fabric rips away
hes pulled out of the plane and dropped to the ground
a giant foot steps in the way as the snout of the creature reaches down and quickly devourers the screaming pilot
its horrifying sight but no one can turn away
pleased with the appetizer the creature comes back for the main course
grant tries to force open the jammed rear door
billy tries to help but the door wont budge
the dinosaur jams its snout into the fuselage and lunges for amanda in the first row
she yanks her legs back as the jaws behind amanda billy reaches forward unsnaps her seat belt and pulls her into the next row back
the others unstrap their belts and crowd into the rear of the passenger compartment
the shift in weight sends the fuselage tipping backwards
the plane breaks free of the tree limbs and drops tail first to the jungle floor
it slams hard then flips over onto its roof
the passengers are prowled on the ceiling of the plane dazed by the impact
everyone is cut and bruised
out of the open cockpit they see two approaching dino feet
a window near amanda fogs over with condensation
when it clears she finds herself looking right into enormous eyes
then all hell breaks loose as the plane is slammed across the jungle clearing
the passengers are hammered against the walls of the plane tumbling like socks in a dryer
debris seats and luggage fly everywhere
the plane comes to an abrupt halt as it smashes into a tree
a gargantuan foot steps on the fuselage and flattens it like a paper tube
inside windows explode raining glass over the passengers
as the walls compress udesky becomes trapped in the rear of the plane the others in front
udesky dives into the narrowing gap and billy pulls him the rest of the way through
billy is as terrified as the rest of them but he thrives under this rush of adrenaline
then a huge claw digs into the skin of the fuselage and begins to slowly peel the plane open
grant looks up in dread at the widening tear
grant leads the group out the open end of the cockpit
they make a mad dash for the jungle
a tremendous roar causes billy to look behind him
he cant help but steal a glimpse of this terrifying but utterly fascinating animal
grant yanks him forward
with grant in the lead and udesky taking up the rear the group tears through the jungle
concealed by the dense undergrowth the unseen dinosaur bears down on them mowing down the young trees which topple all around them
grant spots a grove of and leads the group into it
the dinosaur cannot fit between the trunks
it roars at the fleeing humans searching desperately for a route after them
the group continues their relentless pace putting as much distance as they can between themselves and the beast
paul kirby looks like hes about to have a heart attack
even billy is gasping for air
they stop thinking theyve outrun it
grant directs the group through some underbrush and into our friends stop dead in their tracks
amanda stifles a cry
before them lies an immense unmoving sauropod
then a full grown bull rises up behind the carcass
it was feeding its mouth mottled with blood and carrion
nobody move a muscle
remember the t rex tracks motion
obeying the group freezes for a few long beats
then udesky takes off running
and t rex roars
t rex is right behind them
dashing back the way they came the group suddenly comes face to face with we now get our first full unobstructed view of the gigantic creature spinosaurus aegypticus
over forty feet long and twenty five feet high the dinosaur has a bony sail along its back
its head is crocodilian with rows of long curving teeth
sinewy six foot arms terminate in three fingers hands with fourteen inch claws
nowhere else to run the group scatters into the brush as the two behemoth predators rush forward their roars thunderous
paul and amanda scramble into one direction billy and udesky in the other
but grant cant go anywhere his foot is stuck between two branches
he manages to free himself as the two dinosaurs approach
theyll have to deal with each other before eating the humans
grant dives down between two fallen trees as the spinosaurus and t rex circle one another like gladiators each searching for the others weakness
laying flat on his back grant lets out a terrified gasp as the giant foot of spinosaurus lands across the two trunks mere inches from his face
spinosaurus lunges forward powerful jaw open wide
t rex sidesteps the assault its tail knocking down small trees as it spins out of the way
in the tress paul and amanda scurry again for cover
between the fallen trunks grant attempts to get away on his hands and knees
t rex presses the attack slamming its tail into the flank of its adversary
spinosaurus is knocked back and grant is again forced to duck for cover
as spinosaurus struggles to regain its balance t rex dives forward
spinosaurus is driven backwards as t rex tries to grip its throat
amanda yanks paul out of their path
they scramble over to billy
now on its side spinosaurus fights back ferociously
it slashes at t rex with its long arms and razor sharp claws then finally kicks the animal with one mammoth foot
tyrannosaurus staggers back wounded
down below grant is splashed by the blood pouring from the dinosaur as he slowly makes his way towards his fellow humans
spinosaurus lunges for the t rex with gaping jaws and manages to topple t rex off its feet and sends the falling dinosaur to the ground
with an earth shuttering crash the dinosaur lands between grant and the rest of the group
the companions scurry out of the way but as they do so the head of the t rex now lands almost directly on top of them
plastered against an immense tree the group watches in horror as t rex starts to rise but is thrown back down as spinosaurus latches onto its throat
spinosaurus crushes the life out of its adversary and t rex opens and closes its jaw a mere inches from our terrified friends
finally grant reaches the others
spinosaurus lets out a victorious howl and the blood drenched professor leads the group through the undergrowth
winded from running paul is caught off guard as a furious grant slams his back against a tree
only one thing he wants to know why did you bring us here
paul is too startled to speak
udesky tires to step in but grant gives him back a look
our son is on this island
we need your help to find him
still crunched against the tree paul pulls out a photo from his shirt pocket
this is him
hes thirteen now
hes just about the greatest kid in the world
letting go of paul grant takes the photo a sears style portrait of the boy we saw parasailing at the beginning
he shakes his head disbelieving
he hands the photo to billy
the group splits into two sides paul and amanda grant and billy with udesky stuck between
dialogue overlaps in places
hes with a man named ben hildebrand
her new boyfriend
we were vacationing
eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs so ben found a guy who would take them parasailing
they never came back
we called everyone did everything we could
because of all the controversy over this island no one will step in
costa rica says its a no fly zone its their own damn fault
guys at the u
s embassy our u
embassy said we should accept the inevitable
you believe that
so you hired these mercenaries
we prefer recovery specialists
we do overseas custody issues and
interrupting then you duped us into coming here
we needed somebody who knew the lay of the land
somebody whod been to this island before
disbelieving i have never been on this island
sure you have
you wrote that book
that was isla nublar
this is isla sorna
the second island
low to udesky i didnt know there were two islands
still you have survived the dinosaurs before
you saved those kids
a few of us survived
a lot more died
and we were better prepared and better armed
finally how many days have they been missing
a look between amanda and paul
grand and billy are speechless
it might as well be eight years
after what youve seen today you really think your son could be alive
hes smart dr
and he knows so much about dinosaurs
before anyone else can talk grant puts his hand out
he wants everyone to shut up while he plans their next move
no im sorry but no
well savage what we can from the plane
then we head for the coast
there may be a boat left something to get us off this island
grant were not leaving without our son
you can stick with us or you can go and look for him
either way youre probably not getting out of here alive
with that he leaves a beat later billy follows
he has genuine sympathy for the kirbys but hes logical enough to know grant is right
they look to udesky
what do we do
udesky is clearly at a loss but for everyones reassurance he tries to mutter some brio
well i think we should start searching for your son
in the direction theyre going
they follow after grant and billy
the five survivors search through the wreckage trying to find anything useful
the task is grim
mindful of grants warnings they move quickly and quietly
udesky picks up a gun out of the swampy water
the barrel is bent almost degrees unless
billy finds his camera intact
digging a change of clothes out of his suitcase paul steps around the side of the plane to change
hes in his underwear before he notices amanda is also there changing
nothing you havent seen before
amanda looks over as they get dressed
how much weight have you lost
twenty twenty fire pounds
ive been swimming at the y
you hate to swim
a nod to mean thats the truth
you look good
so do you
they make brief eye contact which amanda breaks
around the side billy is taking photos of a giant footprint the dinosaur left in the mud during its attack on the plane
grant looks over
how would you classify it
obviously a superpredator
best guess suchimimus
they never got that big
not with that sail
billy gives up spinosaurus aegypticus
i dont remember that on ingens list
thats because it wasnt on their list
who knows what else they were up to
billy looks past grant to see paul approaching
hes struggling with the straps on his backpack
turning in circles
billy regards him with suspicion
kirby tell me when you climbed k did you base camp at or feet
thirty thousand i think
closer to the top
about a thousand feet above it actually
closer most mountain climbers remember how tall that mountains were
paul knows hes caught
there is no kirby enterprises is there
i own a place called kirby paint and title plus
were out in the westgate shopping center in enid oklahoma
the plus is for bathroom fixtures fireplaces accessories patio furniture
stuff like that
i dont suppose that check you wrote us is any good
he paid us half up front
mortgaged everything we had to do it
even the store
and if we make it off this island with my son i swear ill make good on the money i owe you
i dont care if it takes me the rest of my life
grant and udesky exchange a dubious glance
however long that is
amanda paul billy udesky and grant walk through the jungle
loud whisper to amanda stop that
grant says this is dangerous territory
well we should split up or something
we can cover twice the area
grant says this dr
grant says that
well whats the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him
grant isnt looking for eric
grant is looking for the coast
and when the tricyclatops comes after you dont come crying to me
oh dont worry about that
what did you say
what did you say
just drop it paul
the kirbys conversation trails off into the jungle
udesky moves up next to grant and billy
if they split up im going with you
and as they continue forward billy spots something in the trees ahead
a parasail chute is caught in the branches of a tree
a yellow life vest hangs limply from a branch
paul rushes over unsnags it and examines the label
got something here
all turn to see udesky holding up a camcorder encased in a waterproof shell
she grabs it from udesky and pops open the housing
she tries the power switch on the camcorder but the batterys dead
udesky pull out a flashlight from his pack and looks to amanda
here give that to me
and as udesky fiddles with the flashlight grant and billy consider the parasail
it looks intact
we should take it with us to signal any planes
i think ive got it
udesky has rigged the wires on the flashlight so that the batteries can be used to power the camcorder
he brings a live wire to back of the camcorder
a red power light comes on
i dont know for how long
udesky swings the tiny screen out and pushes play
the others crowd around
eric and ben play frisbee on the beach
excited thats him
i filmed this the morning they left
ben catches the frisbee checks his watch and motions to eric
eric runs over and ben puts his arm around him as they run to the camera
paul reacts to this image but holds his tongue
the image now cuts to a shot from aboard enriques boat speeding towards isla sorna the start of the movie
eric points excitedly at the island and smiles at the camera
we replay the opening moments of the movie from ben and erics perspective soaring high until
unclip the line
a pan from face to face of all watching this tape with a mixture of hope and nausea
angle again with bens legs in the foreground
hang on buddy
now the camera penetrates the jungle canopy and the picture and sound become complete chaos screams from the both branches breaking flashes of ben and erics frightened faces as the
camera is buffeted in all directions
with a lurch the terrifying descent in finally over and the jungle floor is just ten feet away swaying back and forth beneath ben and erics feet
are you ok buddy
theres gurgling to his voice
ben may be more hurt than hes letting on
through his sobs i dont know
i think so
its going to be okay
here get ready
im going to unhook you
the sound of pumpling is followed by the sight of eric dropping into the frame landing on the ground rolling
he stands and looks back up at ben
im all right weaker were going to get out of this pal
and on that the power and picture fade away
back on paul and amanda overjoyed
everythings going to be all right now
amanda brings a hand to her mouth silently nodding her head
grant and billy exchange a dubious look than begin pulling the parasail out of the tree
as they do so the sail gets caught on a branch
they pull harder
the branch bends but the sail wont come loose
one last tug and than snap
the branch breaks the chute falls away to reveal
it swings down directly at amanda
finally the others are able to pull her away
as they untangle the lines the men are able to get the first view of the remains of ben hillenbrand still caught in his harness
amandas knees buckle
regaining her balance she runs off into the jungle
paul quickly follows
reeling amanda comes to a stop in an area with thick undergrowth
its danger here very still and quiet
she tries to calm herself but each effort to suppress just makes her more emotional
shes surprised as paul wraps an arm around her to comfort her
but she doesnt fight it
im sorry amanda
and im sorry for the things i said about him
i know you liked ben
i had no right to
frustrated its not about him
hes alone out here somewhere
our baby is all alone
saying it aloud the reality sinks in for both of them i guess i was hoping that with ben around thered be someone to keep him safe
checking in on clients udesky stops at the edge of the thicket
something raises the hairs on the back of his neck
he nods for the others to take a look at this
they head over grant at the rear
as he approaches billy is packing up the rest of the chute in a backpack
he stops short from what he sees
looking down we circle across the jungle floor
here we find a strange hollowed out construction made of sod and branches
maybe six feet around
just now noticing the others stare paul looks down into one of the bowls at his feet a half buried nest
its filled with football sized eggs laid in a spiral
and this isnt the only nest
amanda counts twelve in all laid out in an oddly symmetrical pattern
the last to arrive grant identifies the species in a horrified instant
and as he says the words off in the distance we hear the cry of some herbivores around by the chorus of snarls
the party blasts through the forest trying to keep up with grant
they havent even had time to ask to paul whats a raptor
paul has no idea
they dont look that big
i mean comparatively
if we came across one we might live
well thats good
but you never came across just one
from the back wait
they all stop
the only one not there is grant billy
almost sotto i thought we werent suppose to yell
he comes in from the left
excited he explains to grant i got some great pictures of the nest
you know this proves raptors raised their young in colonies
furious with his student
grant just keeps moving
theres no time to stand around and argue
this speaks to a larger social structure the possibility of darwinian altruism
it changes everything
trying not to sound presumptuous we could co write a paper
ah yes the first rule of academics
publish or perish
much fatigued the five now mach upward towards a crest
panting and flushed they reach the top of the ridge and gaze into the distance
a jungle valley stretches before them
not far off in a vast compound comprised of several buildings
one building alone seems to cover several acres
the weary group breathes a sigh of relief
i bet theres a very good chance erics in there
id bet my bottom dollar
udesky and grant share dubious looks and continue down into the valley
the group emerges from the jungles and enters the compound
they walk through an overgrown parking lot littered with abandoned vehicles
some are lying on their side
others are overturned completely
theyre not going to be driving anywhere
a troubled grant peers through a windshield partially caved in like some giant head butted the glass
think back to lost world and the group finally approaches the front doors of an enormous building
as they head up the front steps we see something in the distance behind them on the high ridge
to fast to see what it was
but too ominous to dismiss
our friends now find themselves in a sparse one quietly opulent corporate lobby now in the process of being reclaimed by the jungle roots and ivy poke through the floor
in the waiting area the cushions of a sofas and chairs have been gnawed at and pulled apart
dusty coffee mugs and filled ashtrays lie on the table
the water has turned brackish in a near by cooler
we look up and see birds nesting in the rafters
it is an eerie haunted place
calling out eric
are you here
all listen for a response
paul and amanda exchange a despondent look
sitting on the reception counter is an official looking telephone
everyone has the same thought but no one dares
finally what the hell
amanda puts the receiver to her ear
with grant in the lead they head deeper into the building
unseen by the group a fleeting shadow flits across the lobbys dirty windows with terrifying speed
a couple vending machines stand at the one end of this long hallway covered with vines
paul notices them and pulls change from his pocket
ive got about a dollar seventy five
how about you guys
billy smashes in the window of one machine with his boot
picking through the glass he pulls out some candy bars and chips
he checks the expiration date
thank god for preservatives
he tosses the food to the others
paul now turns to his own vending machine and smashes it with his heal
the glass refuses to break
grant and billy push through a set of doors to see filled with much of the same equipment we recognized from the first island although the sheer size of this
place dwarfs any of the facilities seen previously
as the group walks down the ramp and onto the floor they begin to absorb the incredible array of technology enormous cryonic freezer their plug pulled years ago empty incubators
tanks of formaldehyde with dinosaur fetuses and body parts
machines with intricate tubing and wing arms stand beside conveyer belts cris crossing the room at different levels
this is how you make dinosaurs
this is how you play god
billy looks around the lab
he cant help but be impressed
okay if i take pictures
billy sets his lucky camera back down on the worktable
two years from now astute observers of the dvd will not that billy doesnt actually take his camera from the bag he was carrying it because there wasnt any room
billy pulls a new roll of film from the bag and zips it shut
amanda is passing a large cylindrical tanks with half formed embryos floating in formaldehyde genetic experiments gone awry
finally she reaches floating in the one tank
something about this specimen catches amandas attention
she bends forward getting very close to the glass
she peers right into the eyes of the nightmarish creature
then lunges at her form behind the tank
fortunately the raptor cant get between the closely spaced tanks
and as the group races through the lab the raptors find a larger gap between the tanks
paul leads the way checking the door for possible escape routes or hiding places
twenty feet behind rounds a corner bolting after them
paul ducks in the closest door
the group slams the door behind them and quickly takes in the room
there are several rows of oversized steel cages apparently used for containing young dinosaurs
many of the cage doors are standing open
the group races down a lone aisle
close behind the raptor bursts into the room roars
as the raptor gains ground udesky and billy run into one of the open cages slamming the door behind them
grant paul and amanda duck into another
before they can swing the cage door shut behind them however the raptor slams into it driving the door into the cage
they are forced back against a chain like wall trapped in a small triangle space by the advancing door
the angry raptor is now inches away through the cage door
then suddenly the raptor looks up
we follow its gaze
the top of their triangular enclose is wide open
the eager raptor climbs up the chain like door
catching the tail of an idea amanda grabs the door and nods to the others
they push hard on the cage door swinging it and the raptor right through the opening of the cage
now the raptor is trapped in a small triangular space the door going right to the ceiling
amanda slides the doors bolt through the chain like wall temporarily trapping the dinosaur
the raptor struggles desperately grawling and snarling but the cage door seems to be holding
as everyone rushes back to the door
the raptor begins to make a low haunting moan
as the others head for the door grant lingers a step listening to the beasts simple melodic cry
it has the same tones as came from the model resonating chamber
shes calling for help
the group exits the rear of the lab building and finds itself in a large equipment yard
the call of the raptor is still audible as they head for the tree line
now they moan is answered from distant jungle quarters
the responses quickly multiply
to the groups dismay they soon find themselves virtually surrounded by raptor cries both distant and near
grant looks around with amazement
its vindication of his theory on raptor communication but it couldnt come at a worse time
responding to the growls a herd of grazing hadrosaurs suddenly flees across the open space
then in the distance behind the herd emerges from the jungles coming their way
head for the trees
from the lab building the raptor we left imprisoned now bursts out one of the doors and howls to the pack the same cry we heard in the lab
the raptor pack moves into the hunting formation
one alpha male raptor
slightly larger than the others leads the charge up the middle
grant risks a looks back
but doesnt stop running
grant contd in an effort to escape the oncoming raptors grant leads the group right into the stampeding heard of hadrosaurs
suddenly all is chaos
hadrosaurs race past splitting up the group
letting the others get ahead of him grant looks back
much to his dismay the raptors are ignoring the hadrosaurs
indeed the pack weaves its way through the herd the raptors only want them
in the chaos of the stampede everyone loses sight of each other
up ahead billy trips and falls
as he rolls the strap on his camera bag breaks
he doesnt notice its missing until hes already back on his feet and running
amanda and paul keep close to each other
further back grant spots billys fallen camera back
he grabs it as he runs past
looking back billy sees that grant now has his back
they lose sight of each other in the rush
as the hadrosaurs whip past paul and amanda climb up into a tree
a raptor leaps at paul barely missing his leg
trying to pull paul up amanda nearly loses her balance
this time paul catchers her
billy climbs up a nearby tree of his own in sight of paul and amanda
udesky has nearly reached a tree of his own when he finds himself by a raptor
he turns to the other way but finds he picks up a fallen branch as these dinosaurs cautiously approach
not more than a few feet away the leader of the trio stops peering at him
udesky swings hard but the dinosaurs feints
from behind him another raptor slashes at the back of his legs severing his muscles
udesky cries out and drops to the ground
paul amanda and billy can hear him
listening hes this way
from here the thick branches overlap forming a kind of second floor above the ground
its not easy but you can move from branch to branch tree to tree
unable to walk udesky attempts to crawl away from the animals
the effort clearly causes him great pain
strangely the raptors suddenly dont seem interested in him anymore
rather theyre talking among themselves
udesky is amazed to find him self still alive
suddenly one of the raptors slashes at him again
but its delicately not a mortal blow just a very painful one
udesky cries out louder this time
hearing the new cry paul amanda and billy move faster now finally seeing udesky on the ground
hes face down barely moving but still moaning
the raptors are gone
in the lead amanda starts to climb down
but paul grabs her holds her back
its not safe
we have to help him
a predator wouldnt leave a kill wounded
hes not a kill hes still alive
she breaks from pauls grip and drops to the ground
shes only a foot away from the tree when lead out from their hiding places
they almost catch her as billy and paul pull her back up on the limb the raptors stare up at them angry their plan didnt work
they couldnt climb up so they were trying to get us to come down
they set a trap amazed they actually set a trap
bored with waiting the raptors go back to finish off udesky making a meal out of it
up in the branches the survivors are horrified and sickened
then from the deep in the forest a new raptor cry
the feasting raptors look up listening then suddenly run off into the dark jungle
climbing higher in a tree grant is just feet above a growing pack of raptors
he scales one branch the next finally reaching a perch that the dinosaurs cant jump to
the entire pack is now standing still watching him
in the center the alpha male lets out a sort of bark
responding to the cry the other raptors call back
as terrified as he is he cant help but be fascinated by their communication
like a hellish bird song theres a rhythm to it a structure
theyre clearly talking about something
under his breath grant is able to mimic its patterns
what does that mean
what are you saying
of course they cant answer
they just keep using the same phrase
ready to ditch billys camera bag in order to climb higher hes had to hold it by the strap grant finds his hand covered with a runny slime
he looks down at the camera bag and thats the source
its oozing out the bottom
he unzips the bag to find inside the white and green yolk still dripping from the pieces of the shell
theres another intact egg beside it
this is what the raptors where chasing
god damn you billy
ever the scientist dr
grant tests a theory even in the face of danger he holds up the intact egg so that the raptors can see it
they suddenly go crazy howling the same phrase but louder
it means give us the egg doesnt it
we want the egg
he gently drops the bag to the ground
although the raptors are interested pulling out the unbroken egg theyre still by no means placated
the song may have changed but they still want grant dead
they begin to jump at him eventually hopping up on each others backs
its only a matter of time till they reach him
grant moves to climb higher but sees no branches he can reach
and than he hears the low creaking
the branch hes on is starting to give in
he looks down at the face of his enemies knowing hell be their next meal
and then lands at the base of the trees immediately spraying out a thick cloud of oily fog
its the first of that land in the area creating a thick cloud
its not just smoke though something far more caustic
as it hits the raptors they immediately recoil those closest to the canisters shrieking in pain
tumbling in the dirt
there may be a pheremonal element to the mist as well they seem panicked disoriented
pack mentality takes over and after the first ten raptors take off running so do the rest some tripping over their feet blindly
this may be dino tear gas but its not good for humans either
up in the tree grants eyes immediately burn from the vapor he squints to see through the fog where he spots at the edge of the smoke come on
theyll be back
grant half climbs half falls out of the tree rushing to get through the heaviest of the smoke
grabs his pulling him along
eyes swollen from the gas
grant stumbles barely able to see as the other person pulls him along
its only now we can identify his rescuer as the boy he was brought to rescue
a lot has changed in the last eight weeks
its not just dirt and muck hes the filthiest child youve ever seen something primal has come out in him
on the far side of the tipped over vehicle eric pulls open a hatch his hiding place
the door opens part way
eric motions for grant to follow
squeezing in sideways its very tight fit grant finds himself in a space no bigger than the inside of a datsun
lit by a small battery powered lantern
this is where eric has been hiding
the minute grants inside eric goes back to work re sealing the door
this year old boy has become astonishingly efficient at staying alive
the boy holds up a hand
he listens for a moment
he doesnt hear anything outside
eric your parents are both here
in costa rica
on the island
eric truly cant believe it
he hoped to be rescued but
theyll never make it
i mean they cant manage when the cable goes out
youd be surprised what people can do when they have too
eric studies his guest finally certain he recognizes him
youre alan grant arent you
off surprised reaction i read both of your books
which one do you prefer
the first one
before you where on the island
you liked dinosaurs back then
back then they hadnt tried to eat me
grant takes a better look around erics tiny hideaway impressed with what hes been able to scavenge
among the many items we see another smoke canister some battery powered lanterns and lots of candy wrappers
this kids been living on chocolate for weeks
when ingen cleared out they left a lot of stuff behind
any weapons radios
eric pulls up a long cattle prod to show grant
found this but the batterys dead
its a wonder you arent
im amazed eric
i barely lasted hours
you lasted eight weeks
the line catches eric strangely
its the first moment of true emotion weve seen him in
is that all its been
i thought it was longer
trying to be positive the important thing is we both made it
thats something we have in common
eric rips into a candy bar
after a moment he realizes he should offer one to his guest as well
grant takes it
a lone beat
than grant just has to know
did you read malcolms book
what did you think
i mean it was kind of preachy
chaos this chaos that
and like to me the guy seemed kind of high on himself
thats two things we have in common
the trio is where we left them perched up in the branches
theyre far from safe but nothings after them for a while
in billys eyes we can see a storm of guilt raging
but he hasnt said anything
wont say anything
we cant just stop looking
eric and dr
grant are out there somewhere
i want to find them too but we cant do a bit of good right now
for every scary thing we saw in the daylight ill bet there ten times more of em at night
to billy am i right
i dont know
i thought you were an expert
grant isnt here so were going to have to figure out what to do ourselves
amanda is impressed by her own determinations
a long beat
amanda contd so what do we do
no one has the faintest clue
various shots the creatures of isla sorna walk past in the shadows some looking up at the light in the trees
suddenly one of the creatures is attacked by another
we hear rolling snarling hissing just seeing the outline of the fight
just as fast as it began the fight is over the winner snakes on the loser
everyones moved to different branches trying to settle in for the night
paul keeps looking over to the tearful amanda about to say something
he finally does
i just want you know amanda
its not your fault what happened
amanda looks over not sure what his absolution
paul contd eric has always been headstrong and you throw ben hildebrand into the mix and well
well damn it
i dont speak ill of the dead
what im trying to say is its was just a crazy accident
the exact same thing could have happened if he was with me
you cant go beating yourself up about it
realizing hes trying his best amanda cant stay angry with him
this wouldnt happen if he was with you
i mean you drive five miles below the speed limit
i totaled three cars in fives years
that one time was just the bumper
he would have been safe
completely entirely suffocatingly safe
beat i would have him to see more of the world than enid oklahoma
i wanted to see more of the world than enid oklahoma
and so yes its my fault that this happened
im sorry that you have to be here
really looking at her
im not sorry at all
morning on isla sorna
a low mist hangs tight to the forest floor as eric seals up his hideaway for hopefully the last time
they start walking
eric pulls something out of his pocket shows it off to grant
know what this is
takes it a raptor claw
i use to have one
grant hands it back
eric is becoming more and more a normal thirteen year old boy
theres an innocence to him thats coming back
how much of this island have you explored
i stayed pretty close to the compound figured if anyone came to look for me thats where theyd start
we need to head for the coast
are you sure
closer you get to the water the bigger things get
billy and amanda wait for paul as he comes out of the bushes hiking up his shorts
trying to take charge
we need to stick to the plan
head for the coast
what about eric and dr
going to the coast was alans idea
if hes alive thats where hes headed
what about eric
billy represses his instinct to say erics dead
rationalizing hes probably has a better chance by the coast as it is
figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island
to billy right
as grant and eric walk both stop hearing a strange sound
but for a change its not an ominous one
its a human one
a phone is ringing very faintly
without a word to each other grant and eric decide its coming from the right
paul is picking the briars out of his socks as they hike risking tripping on every step
then amanda stops short
shes the first to hear it after a beat everyone else can hear it too
and recongnition finally lights on pauls face
suddenly paul frantically searches his pockets as the others anxiously watch
you had the phone the whole time
where is it
i dont know
i dont have it with me
when did you have it last
i dont remember think
and paul wracks his memory
i got a call on the plane put it in my coat pocket and
bust suddenly he stops his face is lighting with an awful realization
amanda couldnt bear the wait
i loaned it to nash
he must have had it on him when he
the hideous implication of his words slowly sink in
still following the faint ringing grant and eric turn to find moving through the low trees
we recognize it as the back of a spinosaurus
we might think its any random spinosaurus except for the ringing coming from somewhere inside it
grant and eric press back against a tree keep perfectly still as they hear the thoooomb thoooomb thooomb of the creatures footsteps reverberating
its tail rustkes against the brush
its moving behind them and its close
we hear the ringing move from left to right as it passes
so far its has no idea theyre there
looking across the clearing eric is startled to see are no more than yards away also hiding
an involuntary reflex eric calls out
grant immediately covers the boys mouth
but its to late
the dinosaur has stopped
we still cant see it
we dont know how close it is
paul and amanda spot eric with grant
theyre a thousand emotions at once relieved disbelieving terrified overjoyed
they want to run to him to yell out to him but the monster is close
grant takes his hand off erics mouth
they both stay completely silent
all this time the sat phone is ringing
than it stops
and after an agonizing beat the beast moves
at first were not sure which direction its headed but finally we can tell its moving away
once the sail is finally out of sight eric breaks from grants hold and dashes to his parents arms
they coop him up
hug him kiss him their affection unquenchable
reassuring him sweetheart youre okay
reassuring herself youre okay
disbelieving youre okay
never had a doubt
us kirby men we stick around huh
looking at her grubby son amanda licks her shirttail trying to rub his face clean
honey theres not enough spit in the world for that
its the first times shes laughed in two months
billy crosses the distance to grant
we need to keep moving
alan i want to tell you that im so sorry about the
billy i cant talk to you now
he walks off
billy follows him
just yell at me
call me an idiot
tell me i screwed up because i know i did
grant doesnt respond
i thought if we could get a raptor back to the mainland we could get serious money for it
enough to fund the digging for years
whatever it took
grant shakes his head disgusted but doesnt stop
you have to believe me
i did it with the best intentions
finally turning on him some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions
you rushed in with no thought to the consequences to yourself or anyone else
finally youre no better than the people who built this place
grant keeps walking leaving billy with his guilt
the group enters a structure with giant windows designed to look into the canyon beyond only theres nothing to see but a thick fog
toward the center of the room a spiral staircase that leads to a lower level
with billy lagging grant approaches the stairs and peers down the circular opening in the floor
there is not much to see just fog a glint of sunlight
step by step grant leads the group down a rusty spiral staircase below the observation room
the stairs end in a lower level
although were technically outside this whole place feel strangely enclosed
theres a thick fog at this level clouds really but far below we can see the river
and at its banks a barge
we climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean
with any luck the costa rican coast guard will pick us up
then we go home
then we go home
grant leads everyone down a ramp to a catwalk branches off a set of stairs continuing down the along the canyon wall
grant starts down the stairs
hes only taken a few steps down the rusty staircase suddenly paul grabs him in the nick of time
the staircase vanish into the fog
clanfing against the canyon wall
after a few more seconds of silence they hear the crash far below
grant nods and looks in the other direction
how about if we try this way
their only other option is a precarious catwalk that disappears into the mist
do you think it goes all the way across
one way to find out
the only way to get his near fall is to push ahead
but his stomach turns at being so high
the catwalk creaks and groans listing slightly
she freezes mid stride
glancing back wed better do this one at a time
amanda steps of and grant carefully pushes forward disappearing into the thick fog
the others listen to the creaking of the catwalk until it stops dr
then out of the fog a distant voice call out come on over
one at a time
amanda steps tentatively forwards
eric is clinging to her
eric its okay
youll be right behind me
were not going anywhere i promise
as paul holds eric and amanda shares a look
amanda were all together now eric
eric reluctantly releases her mother
amanda starts to cross
grant has stopped at a lateral support across the catwalk trying to get the sense of where they are and what purpose this place may have served
seeing that the support beams are brace high arched walls of steal mesh it becomes obvious that we are inside this vast construction
amanda emerges from the mist and turns back to the catwalk
calling out okay
come on eric
eric is next to go across
hes still tentative
how bout if i
no i can do it
billy and paul look on as eric disappears into the vapor
muttering to himself thats it eric
nice and easy
eric slowly gropes his way forward
he feels a gust of wind and a heavy thud ahead on the catwalk which now sways beneath him
regaining his balance eric peers forward but the fog prevents him from seeing more than fifteen feet ahead
there is an eerie silence
eric calls out timidly
across the canyon grant moves across the later support
with his hand on the railing he sends a white hardened substance dropping into the mist
looking up grant notices a large strut covered with the same substance
realizing what it could be
oh my god
what is it
a bird cage
then the sound of eric screaming
eric watches as a looming shape emerges from the fog a nightmarish vision stalking purposefully forward
standing over seven feet high walks upright on clawed feet his thirty foot wings folded bat like at his side
the creature sees eric and fixes him with a demonic glare
eric cries out and dashes back down the teetering catwalk
the pteranodon ruses to its feet spreads its thirty foot wings and flies directly at him
hearing erics screams paul charges onto the catwalk searching in the fog
it wont hold
suddenly emerges from the fog racing toward his father
and then swoops out of the fog opens its giant rear claws and snatches the terrified boy from the catwalk
paul kirby watches in stunned abject horror as the pteranodon carries eric directly overhead the flying reptile struggles with the boys weight
paul watches helplessly as eric is carried high across the canyon
paul runs back alone the catwalk in a desperate attempt to keep eric in sight
billy stays behind moving back up the platform to try to keep the dinosaur in view
with a new idea he races back up the stairs to the observation room
he has a way to save eric
when he reaches the canyon wall paul turns a corner and runs along another enclosed catwalk leading deeper into the canyon
grant and amanda now come pounding down the catwalk trying to catch up with paul
where is he
can you see him
shouting back im trying
that thing took him down this way
carries eric deeper into the canyon
the creatures wings beat steadily overhead and the wind is fierce
eric looks down and sees the river far below
the pteranodon swoops over an isolated outcropping of rocks at the end of the canyon and drops eric into a large bowl of mud and branches the size of a
eric lands right on top of a pile of dinosaur bones picked clean
mixed among is one human skull
before eric has time to cry out he looks up to find closing in on him with sharp edged beaks
he picks up the human skull and whips it to the hatchlings
they easily duck it and keep coming
grant looks up to see billy leaning out over the edge of the observation platform
he suddenly realizes what billy is about to do
billy shouts back an excited terrified grin on his face
billy jumps off the railing and grant paul and amanda watch as billy falls past them like a stone plummeting towards certain death
but then blossoms above him
not only does it slows billys descent but he even manages to catch an updraft and begin to rise
he struggles to control the parasail swooping dangerously close to the canyon wall barely avoiding it
up ahead he catches sight of eric and steers towards him
eric struggles to keep away from the hatchlings
but theres no way out of this nest
billy swoops overhead but hes too high to reach eric
he circles around to make another attempt
paul rounds the corner and finally catches sight of eric in the nest some fifty feet below fighting off the hatchlings
hang on eric
paul sees an outcropping he could jump onto from here
its a big leap though he might not make it
he steels himself up for the jump then chickens out
grant and amanda come up behind him
suddenly crash lands on the catwalk enclosure about them right next to a gaping hole in the mesh
the catwalk groans with the extra weight
the pteranodon jams its head through the hole snapping at them
billy circles making his approach
in the nest eric kicks at the hatchlings but theyre undeterred
billy and eric will only have one chance
as billy swoops past eric jumps and grabs onto his boot
he is yanked up and out of the nest
but than mother pteranodon shoots past tearing out a piece of the parasail in its beak
the pteranodon who landed on the top of the catwalk continues to snap through the hole in the enclosure
finally the reptiles massive weight proves to much and the entire section of the catwalk breaks free of the canyon wall and flips over laterally
amanda grant and paul are able to hang on but so is the pteranodon who now climbs their way
his parasail badly damaged billy tries to keep aloft
heading as low as he dares he yells to eric let go
terrified eric falls into the river safely
he surfaces immediately swimming to shore
trying to gain altitude billy bends hard to the right
but the rigging is too badly damaged
he flies right into the canyon wall hitting hard
instead of tumbling down to the river he finds himself swinging from his harness the parasail snagged on a rock spire above him
paul grant and amanda struggle to stay away from the pteranodon as it moves towards them
the far end of this inverted section of catwalk detaches from the canyon wall and the force of the action sends the three tumbling directly towards the pteranodon
miraculously they manage to avoid its open beak
but they are all sent plummeting toward the river below
they hit the water hard resurfacing moments later
the current is carrying them downstream
the two pteranodons who were pursuing billy now land on nearby ledges and consider how best to dispatch their prey
billy frantically tries to unhook his harness but the tension is so tight from his own weight that he cant loosen the buckles
paul and amanda emerge from the water by the canyon wall and find their son hiding behind a rock searching the skies for billy
amanda takes eric tightly in her arms and paul urges them to keep moving
up ahead the mesh of the aviary meets the river
wading the shore grant now scans the canyon searching for billy
it doesnt take long to spot him
billy continues to struggle with the harness but to no avail
the doomed young man is suspended high up on the canyon wall like a modern prometheus an entire flock of pteranodons gathering around him preparing to peck away his liver
and everything else
a mammoth pteranadon has landed beside him and looks him straight in the eye
the gigantic creature lunges at him
billy dodges away as best he can
the pteranodons frustrated bite severs a crucial juncture on billys harness and billy is able to wriggle free
eric amanda paul and grant watch in amazement as billy is the last to plunge down into the river
he made it
billy bobs to the surface and spots the group downstream
he waves and begins to swim towards them
soon he nears the shore and gets to his feet wading as he comes
grant paul amanda and eric hurry to meet him
grant is overjoyed to see him alive
but his smile quickly fades as he sees diving down from above in angry pursuit of their lost prey
billy look out
billy glances behind him
he races forward motioning fro his companions to turn around
just then billy is knocked down by the lead pteranodon
it strikes from behind with a brutal calculated beak to the head
billy stumbles and falls to the ground
grant rushes forward with paul right after him
amanda takes eric to safety down river
billy screams as the entire flock of pteranodons now swarms around him picking him apart with their beaks and claws
its no use dr
grant cant take his eyes off billy whose blood stains the water rushing by
and now several pteranodons are heading their way
difficult as it is to leave billy behind grant and paul make a run for it
just as the pteranodons are about to swoop in for the kill alan and paul dive back into the river
and resurfaces on the far side of the mesh aviary wall gasping for air
just behind them the mammoth crashes into the mesh
it tears at the steel actually ripping it in one place
at the dock up ahead amanda and eric have found a rusty waterlogged barge thats somehow still floating
carrying a tarp covered cage the boat was meant for transporting dinos up and down the river
amanda pushes them away from the dock as alan and paul climb on board
the current takes the craft downstream letting us get our first good look at the incredible its a vast domed mesh structure that spans the entire canyon
in all a feat of remarkable engineering and unmistakable hubris
catching their breath our four survivors look at the cage they were caught in
yanking the starter rope one final time paul finally gets the engine to turn over puttering along
amanda is beside him bailing water
my own kid was right in front of me and i didnt do a damn thing
you couldnt have made that jump
i should have tried
it should have been me on that beach back there not billy
how would you have helped eric
he cant answer he needs you paul
he needs us
he could have died
but he didnt
and neither did you
and im glad about that
grant is beside eric keeping watch but also feeling the weight of billys death
do you have any kids
although ive studied them in the wild
eric looks over not sure what that means
i have a theory that theres two kinds of boys
those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts
i want to be an astronaut
see i was the opposite
i never understood why anyone would want to go into space
its so dangerous
you do one thing wrong and youre dead
the astronomer or the paleontologist get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety
and truthfully everything you really need to learn you can learn it from the ground
but then you never get to go in space
the difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are
to be able to touch them
thats what billy wanted to do
the barge starts to round a bend
on the bow grant and eric are the fist to see something remarkable
eric gasps unprepared
we dont know yet what they see
grant contd i can blame the people who made this island
but i cant blame the people who want to see it
to study it
at the rear of the barge paul just now sees whats ahead
awe struck he slows the motor and motions for amanda to take a look
and so do we
the setting sun illuminates an incredible valley filled with dinosaurs
we see armored ankylosaurs with clubbed tails
duck billed corythosaurs
we float under the gigantic arching necks of eighty foot brachiosaurs
with the mist from the river and the play of light were witnessing a kind of primal eden
grant contd hows a boy suppose to resist this
a full moon passes behind clouds
thunder quietly rumbles and lightning flickers in the distance
paul is still at the wheel
the river is narrower here and cautions must be taken to avoid the banks
as the barge begins to round another bend
a familiar high pitched sound pierces the darkness
muffled but unmistakable it is the ringing sat phone
all exchange looks of sheer panic expecting spinosaurus to leap out at any moment
grant scans the river banks
paul cuts the motor and time seems to stop as the four stand posed for action
the barge finishes rounding the curve and the ringing grows louder
the suspense is excruciating until finally
their eyes widen at some horrifying sight more horrifying than anything theyve yet seen
seven mounds of dinosaur dung sit on the patch off treeless flat ground just beyond the river bank
as our friends consider the sight an idea comes to them all of them almost simultaneously
with eric still in the boat amanda paul and alan jump into the river and rush to the bank
the three companions sprint towards the source of the ringing
find it before it stops ringing
and bracing themselves and hocking their breath they plunge their arms into their respective dung heaps
after a few moments of this disgusting search
ive got something
i think ive got something
all turn to paul
clearing away the clinging defecation he holds up to a beeper
and still the phone rings
returning to their bleak task they shovel the excrement with their arms
finally ive got it
ive got it
grant snatches the ringing sat phone from amandas hands presses a button and puts it to his ear
you too can own a time share in beautiful guadalajara
enjoy a meal in one of our four star restaurants explore our coral reefs or just walk on the beach
the kirbys hear the recorded voice and let out a collective heavy sigh
grant shuts off the phone
in all the excitement none of them notice a fierce horned carnotaur right behind them
the giant creature roars ready to eat them
but as it gets in close it smells them
even a dinosaur wont eat something that is covered in shit
after a beat the carnotaur turns and walks away back into the jungle
cant help but be a little offended
close on the cleaned satellite phones display
the battery level indicator is flashing
whatever you do dont call the u
they wont do a god damn thing
well we dont exactly have a costa rican phone book here so it will have to be somebody we know in the states
someone we can absolutely count on to send help
to amanda stan
i wouldnt trust stan with a snowball in a blizzard
paul glares at her
now eric notices something odd in the river
the others look down in the murky water
just below the surface passes beneath the boat
then a single fish jumps from the water
something mustve scared them
another roll of thunder this time much closer
get the motor going
paul moves the motor and pulls the start cord
the engine sputters but wont come to life
and now the phone beeps
the battery is getting even weaker
grant makes a quick decision and dials
who are you calling
but grant ignores the question
wearing his jammies three year old charlie awkwardly picks up the phone with both hands
he has the mouthpiece next to his lips but the earpiece is hanging out in space
recognizing who it must be
get your mother
a long silence
charlie bites his lip looks around
are you there
the sat phone beeps again this time much louder
amanda and eric watch grant realizing their fate may hang on this single call
paul struggles without success to start the motor
then unseen by the group a rises from the water just fifty yards from the barge
its headed right to them and closing fast
its the dinosaur man
go get mommy okay
not sure what to do with the phone charlie makes a logical choice and hangs it back up
he walks away to his mom
grant realizes hes been cut off
hes about to redial when the barge is rammed sending everyone tumbling
grant manages to stay on top of the wheelhouse but he loses grip on the phone which falls on deck
rises from the water towering over the barge
as lightning flashes and thunder cracks the dinosaur lets out an ear splitting roar
it lunges at grant with gaping jaws
grant leaps out of the way just in time as the dinosaur the entire wheelhouse
charlie leads ellie into the room
hands her the phone
of course its just a dial tone
was somebody on the phone
ellie looks at him with confusion then quickly checks the caller id box besides the phone
its international and not a number she recognizes
grant stays one step ahead of the spinosaurus as the beast rips apart the quickly sinking boat
it spits out the wheelhouse and bites down on the stern of the boat ripping off a chunk
grant is heading up to the other three when he hears the sat phone ring
he spots it just about to fall into the water
dives for it answering
she can hear the spinosaurus roar
but hes cut off by a second roar the sound of someone and then the line goes dead
charlie looks at her with a smile
dropping the dead phone grant scrambles towards the front of the boat and joins paul amanda and eric who have taken refuge in the dinosaur cage
the fearsome beast now lifts the stern of the boat clear out of the water
the cage scrapes across the deck and slams into the gunwale toppling off the barge and grant and the kirbys are still inside
the cage sinks
the closest to the door paul manages to get out
the other three arent as lucky
the cage rotates as it descends and lands on the river bottom with the door side down trapping them inside
in the cold murky depths they pull frantically on the bars
debris and equipment float around them
paul surfaces out of the breath and disoriented
spinosaurus pushes past the boat
if anyone is going to save his family it has to be him
and so he dives
pushing with all his might he manages to tip the heavy structure just enough so amanda eric and grant can get out
paul himself isnt so lucky
spinosaurus grabs the cage and paul throwing both straight up out of the water
paul flies twenty feet away further from the shore
spinosaurus is going after the heroic mr
kirby who dives swimming underwater
hes trying to lead it away from his family
looking around up
he points to a heavy crane assembly designed for lifting cages off the large boats
now well accustomed to fleeing on command amanda sends eric up first climbing the scaffolding like a jungle gym
all the while theyre trying to spot paul
grant is the last to climb reaching the first section as spinosaurus returns from the water slamming into the base of the crane
the whole assembly shudders threatening to rip into the water
just hold on
try as it might the beast cant climb the crane
so instead it rams it shakes it trying to knock them off
eric slips but amanda catches him
about to shed his bag to climb higher grant finds one last hope
its the resonation chamber model
a beat before he decides it may not be the best choice but its the only choice
he blows through it the same eerie pitch we heard before
on the third try hes able to approximate the egg cry he heard the raptors give
he keeps it up repeating over and over
spinosaurus stops for a beat confused how this sound could be coming from a non raptor
but then keeps smashing
we can hear the mounting bolts strain
soon the whole crane will tip
but not before a matching cry is heard in the jungle
grant stops not certain he heard it
but there it is again
he keeps blowing
the crane is close to tipping when a single raptor appears from the darkness chirp barking at the spinosaur who simply bats away
but then more raptors come
and even more
soon there are dozens gathering circling
grant stops signaling
all three survivors watch with horrified fascination knowing their fate is perilous no matter which side wins
looking at his adversaries spinosaurus roars
and suddenly the raptors attack
spinosaurus easily handles the first few but like ants they just keep coming
they climb up his back slicing into him with their razor sharp claws
swim for the far shore
all three drop from the crane arm into the water
meanwhile the fight continues
spinosaurus rallies shaking off many of the raptors but they just keep coming
their hooked claws dig in scraping the meat to the bone
spinosaurus puts up a brave fight to the end but finally collapses dead
the raptors continue to shred it to ribbons
then one of the raptors looks over to see the survivors swimming away
but a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
it goes back to its meal
grant is trying to move them along
still headed downstream
but eric wont budge another foot
we have to keep looking for dad
we have to
i want to look for him too
then we should
she kneels down facing him
shes just as upset as he is but motherhood carries the burden of remaining calm
let me tell you a few things about you dad okay
hes very very very clever very very brave and he loves you ever very much
he loves you too
he loves us very very much
and i know that right now more than anything your dad would want to know that were safe
were going to get out of this and everythings going to be all right i promise
listen to your mother
out of the darkness steps paul kirby
amanda is knocked over with surprise
eric runs to him nearly tackling him
good thing ive been swimming huh
amanda hugs him and eric so tightly they cant breath
the foursome sit back on the wide beach one facing each direction keeping watch
a light rain is falling but they dont seem to notice
trying to keep his boys spirit up
you remember when we went fishing last summer
and i was trying to put the boat in and the trailer sank
and then the tow truck came and tried to pull it out but it got dragged in
and the truck driver threatened to knock your dads lights out
so i said i was the governor and he believed me
eric really smiles remembering the day
amanda is smiling too
she had completely forgotten the incident
that was a fun day
to paul after some consideration
we should try fishing again
you mean it
its worth another shot
and who knows
things might turn out differently
her hand takes his gently brushing off the wet sand fingertips touching
its a small thing but its a start
sensing his cue to leave grant gets up and starts walking down the beach
eric hurries to follow him
he speaks conspiratorially not wanting to alarm his parents
the lady you called how do you know she can help us
shes the one person i could always count on
and shes saved me more times than she realizes
i owe her everything
a long beat as they walk
its strikes me now i never told her that
as they keep walking grant notices something rammed against the rocks ahead
its a speedboat its hull ripped open from the impact
and its not just any boat either its the same dino soar boat that was pulling the parasail
eric hasnt seen it yet so grant stops him
eric do you know what happened to the boat
that brought you here
why did it crash
i couldnt see
do me a favor
go back to your parents for a minute would you
pre empting objections they look worried
eric nods and heads back to paul and amanda
grant forges on approaching the speedboat wreckage
he doesnt know what hell find but he needs to look
almost reaching his parents eric stops
looks out over the ocean where he sees he doesnt say anything for a moment trying to make sure theyre real
and theyre coming closer
they look up to see the distant lights just now making out full forms
he shouts with joy
paul amanda and eric wave their arms making as much motion as possible
the helicopters big military choppers change direction heading straight for them
paul and amanda embrace then kiss the moment getting the best of them grant looks in prepared to see anything in the wreckage
but the cabin is surprisingly intact just a little blood
there are three gashes on the drivers seat back
grant measures their spacing with his fingers
yelling over dr
helicopters are coming
grant looks down to the wet sand around him finding a trail of three toed tracks
to himself no were not
flies right overhead
paul and amanda are confused until the second helicopter starts to land the first on is there to cover them
grant yells at the first chopper trying to wave it away
but the noise of the blades is deafending
at the treeline the upper branches are shaking
at first it looks like its just the wind off the chopper but something more is happening
flies up out of the trees the first of twenty
its a gorgeous and terrifying sight
terrified the costa rican chopper pilot veers away but the pteranodons are already on him
they smash at the windows grabbing on the skids the chopper rolls wildly
one over eager pteranodon sticks his head up to high getting decapitated by the blade
as the second chopper touches down on the beach eric amanda and paul load in
grant is running their way
meanwhile the first copper is losing the battle even as it climbs higher
the helicopter suddenly tips falling smashing into the trees with a massive fireball
seeing the explosion the second chopper pilot takes off
eric amanda and paul are on board but grant is still running up
the helicopter passes right over him
to the pilot you have to go back
we cant leave him
seeing a ladder release by the door paul throws the lever
a cord and steel ladder unfurls dragging across the sand
grant chases after us catching a rung just as it goes over the water
behind him pteranodons are circling the wreckage of the first chopper and starting to go after the second
buffeted by the wind grant climbs the ladder up towards the chopper
a pteranodon flies up right behind him trying to bite
it catches grants shoulder
grant spins to the far side of the ladder
the pteranodon goes to bite him again but finds it head caught between the rungs
as it tries to free itself it just gets more entangled
the entire ladder starts to lift caught by the updraft from the creatures wings
up with the pilot amanda sees the other pteranodons are headed back to the island unable to keep up
theyre not following
in back paul and eric get the ladder mechanism to begin to retract
it reels grant in faster
it also reels in the pteranodon which may be caught but is still plenty dangerous
as grant reaches the cabin they shut off the ladder engine
the pteranodon is still working its way free pulling itself closer and closer
shouting over the noise we have to cut it
find something sharp
everyone checking the cabin for a knife anything sharp
finally eric hands grant the raptor claw
grant uses it to rip the line
the fibers break and fray but the pteranodon keeps coming closer
paul throws a wrench at the pteranodon whacking it straight in the head
it felt good and damn if it didnt slow it down a little
grant has cut through the cord
he started on the second when the pteranodon snaps at him going for his hand
theres nowhere for grant to cut without the pteranodon getting him
and idea grant very deliberately places in his hand on the line pulling away at the last moment
the pteranodon itself bites through the line
the pteranodon falls away from the helicopter catching wind just before it hits the water
it circles and flies back to isla sorna
as horrifying as the creature was a moment ago its suddenly beautiful again
each motion of its giant wings is a small symphony
sitting between his parents eric looks back at the island in the distance
what do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs
the population will stabilize eventually
theyll adapt to fit different roles
either that or the government will firebomb it back to the stone age
i would completely support that
looking back at the island
i hope they dont
i want to come back someday
so do i
the helicopter flies away across the ocean leaving the island behind
