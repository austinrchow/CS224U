by mark frost and michael france based on the marvel comic book by stan lee and jack kirby shooting script our first thought dr
but its not moving
a welders torch sparks into frame in the hands of a sculptor on scaffolding
this is art an epic foot statue going up of a business mogul victor von doom in whose generously extended hands sit two intertwined columns of dna
his face is chiseled angular perfect too perfect
past sparks we move down to pick up
reed richards and ben grimm head toward the soaring glass box atrium of vdi headquarters
designed to inspire awe it does
high open space exposed structural elements
obviously aimed at first time visitors to create feelings of
ben glances at reed who looks a little nervous
good thing it aint workin
reed what are we doing here
this guys fast food strip mall science this wasnt our first stop in case you forgot nasa
and victors not that bad
hes just a little
seeing the statue larger than life
they move past the statue into the sprawling atrium
hes financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century
youd never know it
he motions to a high tech orb showing footage of vdis accomplishments a safe and clean nuclear facility the first private space station
all images have victor front and center glad handling george bush tony blair shady international leaders
the last image is victor holding the americas cup
they reach three stern receptionists
reed richards and ben grimm to see a receptionist cuts him off handing them each a pass
executive elevator top floor
whats the price for a smile round here
they head for the elevator
reed carries a small black box
as they enter the elevator steel doors shut and we cut to a large dark office
ben in the corner
he yawns watches
bright holograms stars
they hover in the air making the room feel like a majestic portal into outer space
my research suggests that exposure to a high energy cosmic storm born on solar winds might have triggered the evolution of early planetary life
reed stands among the holograms speaking to a mysterious figure in shadow behind a desk
an ominous pulsating red cloud covers the stars
it washes over a hologram of earth
in six weeks another cloud with the same elemental profile will pass earths orbit
a study in space could advance our knowledge about the structure of the human genome and help cure countless diseases extend human life the shadow clears his throat
reed speeds up emotional
give kids the chance to be stronger healthier less prone to turn it off
the figures deep voice pierces the darkness
but i havent fully explained my yes you have
those were always your trademarks
lights brighten revealing the face behind the voice victor von doom
he looks almost
he drops a wired magazine to the desk
reed is on the cover over the words richards bankrupt grant but dreams dont pay the bills do they
a condescending smile same old reed the hopeless optimist
still reaching for the stars with the world on your back
you remember in school we talked about working together
thats what i was about to explain
reed presses the remote
another hologram appears a shuttle slowly approaching an orbiting space station
both bear the von doom industries logo
victor smiles more intrigued
so its not my money you want
its my toys
tell me if nasa doesnt trust you why should i
victor is a step ahead
reed pauses thrown for a beat
ben wakes up suspicious
he notices everything
thats my job
to stay a step ahead
to know what other men dont
ben gets close to reed turning toward the door
i cant take this
low quiet ben
this is business
victor cracks a smile enjoying the tension
hes right ben
they turn to see
sue storm demure stunning standing in a corner
possibly for the whole presentation
a little cold its just business
i think you both know my director of genetic research susan storm
under breath to reed one more thing hes got
sue gracefully walks into the office only taking her eyes off of reed to give ben a warm hug
ben its been too long
she gives reed a polite handshake
victor watches carefully
reed looks uncomfortable in her gaze
a little tongue tied
youre youve i mean how have you bee never better
victor sizes them up
he puts a hand on sues shoulder
this isnt going to be a problem is it
not at all
victor smiles eyeing sue
then youre just in time to hear the great reed richards ask me for help
to reed you know you made a lot of folks at mit feel like a junior high science fair
so youll excuse me if i savor the moment
a hard beat
reed sucks it up
you back this mission and ill sign over a fair percentage of any applications or the numbers seventy five
and its applications and patents
what about his first born
quiet ben the moneys not important
we could save lives
sue gives a thin smile a flicker of old feelings
twenty five percent of a billion is enough to keep the lights on isnt it
maybe even pay off your fourth mortgage on the baxter building
they look at victor
how does he know all this
reed looks at ben who shakes his head softly no
drops a nod
victor smiles offers a handshake
well then to our future
his other hand on sues shoulder
funny how things turn out isnt it
as reed and sue lock eyes ben watches victor
director of communications leonard enters checking files
if reeds right then this little trip will double our stock offering
and if hes not
reeds always right
good thing he doesnt always know what hes got
reed and ben step into the elevator
he knew about nasa
what if he made the call to shut us down ben think about all the people we can help if this works maybe you should think about yourself for once
you always let this guy push you round we got what we wanted
i know i know
im just worried about what he wants
speaking of which
reed follows bens eyes to
she joins them
you sure about this reed
he nods head down
he doesnt want eye contact
those solar winds are flaring but i factored them into my coordinates and i was talking about us
sue holds her eyes on reed
he is clearly uncomfortable in her gaze
did the elevator just get smaller
thinking talking fast well uh based on our history
you can handle the biogenetics and ill focus on the molecular physics
or uhm maybe i should take the biotech you work the microscopes since you have some background in electropho droll a little annoyed right
thats exactly what i meant
she shakes her head same old reed
he looks at her what did he say wrong
ben smiles patting reed on the shoulder
way to not overthink it
to sue so when do we leave
ill schedule the launch
call me in the morning to talk about resources and crew
she offers a business card
reed doesnt take it
i uh think i remember the number
its been changed
reed takes the card his eyes down
as far as crew i was hoping ben could pilot the mission well hes welcome to ride shotgun but we already have a pilot on our payroll
you remember my brother johnny
off bens curdling smile we dissolve to a helicopter shot through trees
we soar over timberland and find something massive looming on the horizon a spacecraft
a sleek take on a space shuttle
modern tech combined with industrial design that nasa could never afford
the crafts nose is pointed straight up ready for launch
workers in jumpsuits are scattered around the two hundred foot tall scaffolding performing routine checks
ben stares up at the craft
a sneer on his face
cant do it
i cannot do it
external srbs orbital system engines
its just like the shuttles you flew in no
i cannot take orders from that underwear model
that wingnut washed out of nasa for sneaking two victoria secret wannabes into a flight simulator
youthful high spirits
they walk toward the base of the scaffolding
they crashed it into a wall
a flight simulator
im sure hes matured since then
close on johnny storm leaning over to kiss a hot redhead
pull back to reveal hes riding a motorcycle and shes driving a red corvette with license plate frankie
pick up reed and ben watching through binoculars
when have i asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do
i had it at four
this makes five
reed and ben unpack gear into lockers
suddenly captain on the bridge
ben goes to attention on reflex johnny snaps a picture with a digital camera
then advances as ben realizes who it is
the look on your hard ass former cos grill when he finds out hes your junior officer priceless
ben eyeballs johnny suddenly reaches up as if to grab him
but ben just reaches for johnnys zipper adjusts his uniform
i can handle the ship
i can even handle mr
but i dont know if i should be flying or playing vegas in these suits
who the hell came up with them
sue enters wearing her blue wetsuit like uniform carrying a stack of flightsuits
she hands them out to the guys
the synthetics act as a second skin adapting to your individual needs to keep the hot side hot and the cool side cool
reed stares at sue in the skintight outfit
she wonders maybe hopes is he actually checking her out
material made from self regulating unstable molecules
ive been working on a formula for this
great minds think alike
guess some think faster than others
victor enters wearing his custom tailored flightsuit
i hired armani to design the pattern
these colors will look great on camera
a door opens
leonard enters in a sharp suit
theyre ready for you sir
leonard leads victor through the halls
victor checks himself in mirrors as he walks fixing his hair his uniform
our numbers are through the roof
the ipos tracking at fifty sixty a share
the banks five times oversubscribed its not just the money
i could make money in my sleep
then what is it
everything else is conversation
a beat hows the other matter
leonard pulls out a box
opens it a ten karat diamond ring
harry winston sends his regards
they hit a set of big doors
victor stops and looks into the reflective metallic surface on the wall
he fixes one last strand of hair
then he opens the door to
whip pan a row of cameras snapping shots of retrofitted into a makeshift press area
victor sits on a platform with reporters stretched out below him
today we stand on the edge of a new frontier
in the furthest depths of outer space
we will find the secrets to inner space
the final key to unlocking our genetic code lies in a cosmic storm
behind the action reed sue johnny and ben walk past
news crews barely notice passing without even taking a picture
our fantastic four are not exactly big news
isnt that your speech
hes made a few changes
this is your dream reed
you should be the one up there
victors better at these things
just past the press area they see
one woman standing waiting
this is debbie bens fiancee
and for the first time in the entire film
they hug kissing
johnny and reed watch
reed glances at sue who walks ahead
debbie slips a photo into bens flightsuit
a tender beat
ill be watching over you
just get back soon or i start looking for a new groom
ben looks at the little engagement ring on her finger
soon as im back im gonna trade that in for a bigger rock
i dont care about rocks i care about you
to reed you bring him back in one piece or you can forget being best man
reed nods smiles
debbie gives ben a last kiss
ben turns to johnny who gives a cocky smile
what the hell you smiling at
just keep your mouth shut and your mind on those smbs actually the engines are smes
hydrogenbase carbon propellant
couple generations past your last ride
at the threshold im not as dumb as you look
ben just glares at reed
this is going to be a long trip
as they follow after sue we cut back to mid speech
playing behind him is reeds hologram stars give way to a pulsating red cloud
think of a world without genetic flaws no asthma allergies baldness breast cancer
ben and reed hear the speech
whats wrong with being bald
victor smiles at the crowd commanding
a true leader
darwin discovered evolution
now we i will define it
only in america could
the red cloud of cosmic rays wash over the earth
a little country boy from latveria build one of the biggest companies in the world and truly reach the stars
now if youll excuse me history awaits
on those words the hologram transforms to
von dooms shuttle on the launch pad
thrusters fire white hot
smoke billows across the pad
ready for take off
victor walks past the hologram and exits
his departure perfectly timed with the shuttle lifting off
we push in on the shuttle and follow the ship as it leaves earths atmosphere
boom booster rockets fall away and the shuttle fires its thrusters
the hologram transitions to
a shot of the space station high above the earth
the shuttle enters from the top lighting up the hologram with engines afire
as the shuttle approaches the station we cut the space station in the distance rotating in orbit above earth
the shuttle eases in and docks
victor and sue lead the others into the command center
a dad voice to ben if you behave maybe next time daddyll let you drive
keep talking there wont be a next time
reed is focused on the earth
long way from the projection booth at the hayden planetarium isnt it
reed turns towards her a little stunned that she would bring that up
its the first time shes been nice to him so far
he smiles gently hesitantly always hesitant with sue
yes it is
johnny and ben exchange a look
reed keeps looking at the stars eyes wide like a little kid
they enter the nerve center of the space station
victor goes to a computer console on the observation deck below
the windows are closed so theres nothing to observe
to ground via comm link leonard hows the feed
we see you perfectly
victor glances at a camera mounted into the console
we can monitor the clouds approach and observe the tests from here
is it safe
the shields on the station should protect us
whats wrong ben
eighty million dollars worth of equipment not enough for you
ben turns to victor
a little tension
reed cuts it lets start loading those samples
get your suit ready ben
victor keeps his eyes on ben
so you still do all the heavy lifting
victor gives a friendly smile patting reed
maybe you should have stayed back in the lab
field work never suited you
reed doesnt defend himself
ben steps up
he does the talking
i do the walking
victor holds tight to his smile
he nods condescending
so take a walk ben
im going to borrow susan for a second
ben and johnny read his eyes as we cut to ben preps for a space walk putting on a helmet and boots
johnny unloads a set of clear sample boxes off of a cart each containing a variety of plants
please tell me your dawgs not trying to rekindle things with my sister
yeah well his eyes say different
hey two hearts got busted last time
maybe shes not over it either
lets see you got victor stud of the year more coin than god
or reed the worlds dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp
hmmm its a toss up
put your tiny little mind at ease
dont you wander off boy
johnny steps out of the air lock and shuts the door
he looks through a small window to see ben give the thumbs up
the airlock door opens and ben gracefully steps into space
sue descends the stairs at victors behest
surprised i agreed to reeds proposal
i understand the business reasons
well when youre looking at your future it never hurts to find closure about the past
sues eyes narrow
what is this about
susan every man dreams that hell meet some woman he can give the world to
he presses a button and the observation decks outer windows open up revealing a spectacular romantic view of the earth
in my case its not just a metaphor
while she stares out the window victor reaches into a pocket revealing a ring box
sue looks unsettled
reed checks data on a work station set on a wall
the results of his calculations are not what he expected
he sees wind velocity digits rise
he does a double take when he sees the readout event threshold t minus
behind his back victor holds the ring box in hand
youve been with me two years now
sue doesnt know where this is going
she treads lightly
its been a good two years victor
the companys accomplished so much
right of course the company
but you see ive come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with uh victor i hope i havent done something to
make you think
sue ive lived my life unafraid of taking big steps
and this is the biggest step yet
if it helps think of this as a promotion
a merger of sorts
getting closer four little words that can change our lives
he is about to spring the ring on her
she looks like a deer in headlights
she opens her mouth and
doors slam open
reed rushes into the room
the cloud is accelerating
victor quickly puts the ring back in his pocket
i dont know what happened
sue quickly moves to a nearby control panel to verify reeds claim
starts punching buttons
confirms reeds findings with a nod
victor hardens in control
weve got minutes until it hits not hours
victor that storms deadly the radiations lethal
we need to abort
get a grip
we didnt come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch
just close the shields
bens still out there so reel him in
but we came here to do a job
so lets do it
ben is carefully arranging sample boxes of plants
ben we need you back inside
ben turns to see reed and johnny staring from a window
i aint done arranging your flowers egghead
this is serious
ben sees johnny motioning for ben to look behind him
ben turns and sees the cosmic storm rumbling toward the station
not close but not far
that gets bens attention
roger that on my way
he turns back towards the ship
behind him the storm grows
victor rushes into the room looks at the monitors
sees the others near the airlock on one screen and the approaching cloud on another
anxiety creeps across his face
event threshold in two minutes
reed and johnny stand by the airlock waiting for ben
they heard the automated voice
it panics reed
come on ben come on
reed were running out of time
a wake of turbulence from the cloud hits ben making it harder to maneuver
the clouds tendrils snake toward him
they can see ben outside the window still twenty yards away
the entire corridor rumbles
lights flicker and spark
they watch helplessly
sue watches the monitor also helpless
victor annoyed by the indecisiveness marches right up to sue
practically shoves her aside as he hits the intercom
reed you need to get up here so we can close the shields
sue glares at victor
his lack of compassion shocks her
not until ben is back inside
its too late for him and soon itll be too late for all of us
victor doesnt bother to wait for a response
he takes over the console punching keys
what are you doing
raising the shields
you cant leave them out there
sue glares with as much contempt as her face can muster
reed had his chance
you cant help them any more than i can
she takes a step toward the door
not sure what to do
i can try
with one final glare she bolts from the room
reed bites his lip
johnny get to the command center
close the shields
what about you
one look from reed tells johnny he wont leave without ben
johnny eyes ben steels his courage
hes not going either
to ben come on big guy you can do it
victor watches the shields slide down
event threshold in thirty seconds
sue races down the hall
the exterior air lock door slides open
in agonizing weightless slow motion ben reaches to haul himself inside
the leading edge of the cloud hits ben is pelted by a hissing mass of space dust splattering his suit with orange stains
larger particles small pellets pepper him
ben hauls himself in the last few feet by pulling on his tether
event threshold in ten seconds
johnny punches controls to close the exterior airlock door
reed opens a first aid kit grabs a thermo elastic blanket
clutching the diamond ring victor stands defiantly
showing absolutely no concern for the others
interested only in the event itself
lights and equipment fall crashing around him
a control panel explodes in victors face
he jumps back and into the falling equipment
collapses under the weight
sue rounds a corner sees reed and johnny
slow motion everyone frozen in position as johnny is hit with sparks of flame from a control panel
reed reaches out for ben and the airlock door
vapor stream pours down on sue from a blown gasket
the space dust burns into bens skin
slow motion just before the exterior air lock door closes a single particle zips through the narrowing gap and hits ben in the back ripping through his suit
the exterior door shuts and seals
the station loses all power
as quickly as it came the cloud passes on and whirls away leaving the space station intact
power quietly flickers on
all four pick up exactly where they left off unaware of anything that just happened to them
victor emerges from the rubble
he stands checks his body
a few scrapes nothing serious
a thin throbbing cut on his head
he touches the wound but it is not bleeding
reed and johnny scramble to open the interior air lock door
sue joins them as they pull ben in
they try to remove his helmet
we dont see his face but hes clearly unconscious
hes not responsive ben
ben wake up
subjective camera bens pov the blurry image of johnny comes slowly into focus standing beside a hospital bed
where am i
back on earth
victors medical facility
were in quarantine
johnny looks away as if he cant bear to lay eyes on him
whats wrong with me
i swear to you theyve done everything humanly possible
the best plastic surgeons in the world ben
you had the best give me a mirror
johnny picks up a hand mirror on the bed table before ben can reach it reluctant to give it to him
they said thats not such a good idea the shock alone could give me the god damn mirror
ben grabs it from him
then slowly raises it to look and see that
except for some serious stubble bens totally normal
unfortunately the doctors just couldnt do anything to fix your face
he cackles as he heads for the door
ben heaves the mirror at him breaking it into hundreds of pieces
he turns to the side table and grabs that picture of debbie
it calms him
a modern facility of glass and stone nestled in the forest
in stark contrast to the lush greenery surrounding it
reed walks down the hall
his hair is graying at the temples
he passes johnny who is smiling still enjoying his joke on ben
johnny slows looking at reeds hair
going for the grandpa look
reed passes a mirror slowing seeing his gray hairs
he keeps going
he passes a partially open door
he stops when he catches a glimpse of sue asleep in bed
he sees a vase of flowers
he grabs a couple lilies and enters
but reed sees
the room is already filled with expensive flowers
all from victor
reed is trumped once again
a doctor writes on sues chart
a wall tv plays a press conference with victor outside the facility
he looks worse for wear
a few hairs out of place and a small bandage on his face
we push into the press conference youve been accused in the past of moving science a little too fast accused by who
but surely this accident gives you pause danger is always part of discovery
what would have happened if ben franklin never went out in a storm
without risk theres no reward
so wheres the reward
you promised a cure all
for the first time
just a flicker
and youll have it
ive never come up short
and im not going to start now
so youre still taking vdi public yes of course
ive never been more confident in the compan reed mutes the television
hows she doing
vitals are strong
reed takes the clipboard looks for himself
blood panels show no irradiation
youll step up this protocol every four hours
we know what were doing
one more day of observation then youre all cleared
the doctor takes his clipboard and walks out
reed steps to sue with the drooping flowers in his hand
i want to tell you
a nurse rolls in with a tray bearing ten more extravagant bouquets
reed looks resigned
he walks out
shes allergic to orchids
put that amaryllis apapathos by her bed
the african lilies
theyre her favorites
reed exits dropping his two wilted lilies into the trash
sue opens one eye as the big lilies land by the bed
a sexy nurse wheels a testing station into johnnys room
hes stripped down to calvins changing into a ski outfit
and where do we think were going
i dont know if weve noticed but the sickest runs this side of the alps are right outside that window ive noticed
but doctors orders youre not allowed to leave until we finish the tests i know could you give me a hand with this zipper
you know this is not a ski resort
johnny opens the cardboard box revealing a colorful fiberglass object the size of a briefcase
in the blink of an eye he unfolds it into a long snowboard
luckily grandma still sends care packages
the nurse pops a thermometer in his mouth to shut him up
you are trouble
thermometer in his mouth brubbles my triddle name
they both pay more attention to his zipper than the digital read out it runs right up past
then accelerates fast
so are you
i mean you feel a little feverish
ive never felt better in my life
when do you get off work
my shift ends at four but i couldnt meet me at top of the run
thatll give you a minute to freshen up
he hands her the thermometer a quick kiss and hes out the door
the machine beeps johnnys temperature is ben finds reed on a patio with a panoramic view
reed works at a laptop computer
how long was i out
i was worried about you
how are you feeling
ben can see reed doesnt look too solid
how you doing
reed shakes his head looking back at his screen
i dont know
i just keep going over and over the numbers
even you cant compute every little thing
i should have done more run more tests ben gets closer pushing down reeds computer screen
it was a freak of nature
last i checked you dont have a crystal ball
let it go
but he cant let it go
he opens his computer back up returning to work
ben shakes his head looks out at the view
his eyes catch on something wheels turning
you go through something like this makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life
yeah you and debbie and perfect reed im not talking about debbie
reed follows bens eyes to a lower level patio sue
shes got a good thing with victor im sorry did that cosmic bath loosen your screws
hes smart powerful successful well maybe you should date him
reed looks at ben resigned
hell give her the life she deserves
she ended up with the right guy
things worked out for the best
reed steps away
ben stands alone an idea sparking
do i have to do everything myself
the chopper hovers over this pristine peak
johnny and his nurse sit in the chopper bay prepping their ski gear
johnnys customized snowboard has wild acrylic patterns
his nurse wears a hot pink cat suit her skis dangling out
their bodies are close a sexy competitive flirtation
they look down at a death defying black diamond run
me like y
left is trouble
i though we went over this
last one down springs for room service
she pulls down her goggles jumps out
johnny drops out after her hitting the snow
he smolders literally
the snow bank behind him sizzles and starts to melt
he takes off after her and the chase is on the nurse knows every inch of the trail slicing expertly in and out of the trees through deep powder
johnnys a speed freak maximizing velocity closing the gap between them
ghostly flames shoot off his hair his ski cap catches fire flies off
jets of fire knife through the back of his jacket
the nurse looks back in a burst of speed johnny draws even
she looks over and sees the flames shooting out behind him
youre on fire
not this again no youre on fire
johnny sees his gloves are burning flicks them off in alarm
his body shudders the back of his ski suit catches on fire
a burst of flame launches him down the slope like a rocket
nurse loses concentration falls
johnny races away like a missile screaming in exhilaration
he looks back no nurse
he tries to put out his flaming clothes and accidentally veers to the left
he fails to notice the giant chasm in front of him
he faces forward and
launching off the cliff legs flailing trying to catch ground
flames begin to trail his body as he falls towards the rocks below
he tries to will his body away
instead his body becomes engulfed in flame
he is a human torch
and for a moment he holds the air the fire giving him some kind of
he maneuvers just over the rocks almost making a degree turn
he looks back at the rocks in disbelief
but the lift doesnt last long
he quickly crashes landing hard into a snowbank
he opens his eyes tries to move but cant
hes trapped under snow and ice
with all his strength he tries to move no dice
panic sets in
his eyes go wide as the snow around quickly begins to melt
johnny is on fire and within seconds hes sitting in a small pond steam rising from the water
the nurse races toward the steam
she finds johnny
smiling sitting naked in an impromptu hot tub staring at his hands
care to join me
she smiles and unzips
the flames dissolve to
candles in on an expansive parapet with a billion dollar view victor prepares a romantic dinner setting as his staff scurry about
he checks every fork and knife with a slightly manic energy
hows the ipo
were looking at low twenties
its a good number considering the fallout from reeds disaster
you know i half think he did this to me on purpose
sir im sure he wouldnt put himself but victor is on to the next thought always strategizing
get me on the am shows larry king cover of the journal
staring into silver tray ive got to do something about this scar
make sure they only shoot my right side
actually uh people seem to think the scar humanizes you
and thats a good thing
victor looks at the scar enraged by this defect
it glistens in the silver tray
his eyes are bloodshot sleepless
you know maybe you should get some rest later
first ive got some unfinished business
a deal that needs closing
leonard looks at the table the lavish spread
sir ive always wondered
you could have any woman in the world but thats why
because i could have any other woman
you know when they asked caesar why england he said because its not mine
two dozen employees sit and eat
others serve themselves at the buffet
ben and sue walking into the dining hall i can only stay for one drink ben
ive got to meet with victor
wouldnt want to keep vic waiting
they turn a corner and find reed entering by another door
hey reed what are you doing here
before he can answer great why dont you join us
he quickly shepherds the two of them toward a quiet table
bens stomach growls so loud that they all can hear it
god im starving
gonna hit the buffet
bens stomach growls again even louder this time
the sun is long gone and so are most of the diners
the room is darker more romantic
ben finishes the last shrimp on his plate pushes it away belches prodigiously
sue and reed stare at him
bens stomach growls again
are you alright
i think i need to lie down
this was bens plan but he really isnt feeling well unsteady when he walks away
he looks down at his stomach
really bad shrimp
sue looks gorgeous in the light
a long beat
reed doesnt know where to start with this woman
you always had a way with words
an awkward beat i should be getting back
sue gets up to leave
exasperated reed tries to think of something anything to say
im really happy for you and victor
she slows down looking at him
she was hoping for more
youre happy for me and victor
i can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship which was
we see surprise on sues face and
frustrated you are such a dork reed
you never got it and never will unless its explained to you in quantum physics
as if triggered by her emotion the fireplace light around her bends
the flames flicker in a ghostly breeze
what did i say
she looks more disappointed than angry
its never what you say
its what you dont say
what you dont do
she lets that hang
a lot of history here
quiet hurt she wants reed to fight for her to show some emotion
i just wanted to as sues emotions swirl she slowly
its been two years and all you can say is youre happy for me and some other guy
standing up hurt you know victor may be a lot of things but at least hes not afraid to fight for what he wants
reed looks down and its nice to be wanted sometimes
to be heard
reed look at me
he looks up
but all thats left of her is the blush on her cheek and her bewitching eyes
he drops his fork shocked
what do you mean you sue
look at your hands
she raises her hands but we dont see them
we only see a medical waistband
her clothes appear to be suspended in mid air
sue is invisible
she shrieks and gets up knocking a glass off the table
slow motion the glass flies off the table tumbling
reed instinctively reaches for the bottle his arm stretches two feet out of his sleeve grabs it just before it hits then snaps back into place
reed stares at his arm in disbelief
sues eyes widen as well
the rest of sue reappears
they look at each other mutual alarm
you guys will not believe what just happened
they look up to see johnny in the doorway naked except for the nurses pink parka wrapped around his midsection
the candles burn low on the table
victor strides out heading for the door
he runs his hand through his hair to comb some strays
a clump comes off in his fingers
he steps to a mirror stares at his hair
it is longer than the bandage now as if it spread
victor peels back the bandage and sees the scar is bluish gray
deep unhealthy maybe infected
double doors burst open
reed sue and johnny urgently walk
it has to be the cloud
its fundamentally altered our dna
lets not jump to conclusions we need a massive amount of evidence before making that leap
reed glances over his shoulder
sue follows his gaze to see johnnys fingertips are on fire
he snaps his fingers
they go out
hes totally unharmed
now what is up with that
deadpan the cloud has fundamentally altered our dna
whatd it do to you guys
apparently i can disappear
please tell me you go silent too
only one thing on reeds mind we have to find ben
johnny snaps his fingers which generate small explosive bursts of flame
he turns it on and off like the clapper
flame on flame off
flame on flame off johnny
he does it again
flame on flame off
reeds about to knock on bens door when he hears the banging moaning and pleading inside
oh you dawg you
better not be my nurse
ben are you there
a creepy rippling movement begins beneath the sheet and gradually intensifies reflected in the fabrics surface the contours of bens body are changing inflating growing rough and craggy
sound of grinding heavy rocks
open up ben we need to talk
it all stops
a beat then all four legs of the bed give way and it crashes to the floor
under the covers he groans in pain and his voice is deeper gravely but definitely clear reed decides they cant wait any longer
he kneels to the floor
he concentrates not sure if it will work
suddenly his arm stretches thin enough to creep under the reeds arm wriggles under the door
it bends upward swiping clumsily until it finally grabs the knob
rubbery fingers find the latch and unlock the door
reed focuses and pulls
his arm snakes out from under the door and snaps back into place
his flesh and bones reforming before their eyes
johnny stares at reed
that is disgusting
they hear a tremendous smash from inside the room
they open the door
the room is trashed
every stick of furniture smashed to splinters
their eyes adjust theres a huge hole where the window used to be
they rush to it
looking out they see something large in the distance running away
what is that thing
i think that thing is ben
reed looks out emotions roiling
is that his best friend
suddenly victor comes around the corner bandage bigger
whats going on
victor are you feeling alright
he considers but never shows weakness
just a little banged up
a couple scrapes
ben did this
ben did this
hes had some kind of
reaction to exposure from the cloud
and hes not the only one
we need to find him
victor redirects his attention to sue
victor im sorry i cold just find him
victor strides off leaving the others
anybody know where the big guys going
we push in on a picture of debbie lying on the floor reed knows exactly where ben is going
hes going home
a view from brooklyn manhattan glistens in the distance
camera moves down to a train yard where we find empty cargo trains
we push in on the main track where
a cargo train has just stopped
we hear a cargo door slide open then whump
big feet hit the ground
someone or something barrels into the night
a locked storefront on flatbush ave
sound of breaking glass
series of shots ben tries on clothes shoes
jackets rip shoes split
he needs an extra extra extra large
a huge figure is huddled in shadow
close on the dial pad
big fingers try to push keys but theyre too large
ben tries for a few seconds getting more and more frustrated
he manages to press with his pinky
ben looks up the street into the nd story window of a modest working class home
his eyes go soft when he sees debbie grab the phone
i need you to step out front
you home baby
i got a surprise for you
he blinks hard
i got a surprise for you too
debbie steps out
there is welcome home sign over the door
she looks out
the wind blows softly
something shifts in the darkness
debbie pulls her robe tighter
dont come any closer for a sec
this is gonna be kind of a shock
you remember when we said together forever no matter what
baby youre scaring me
a hanging beat
steps into the light where we see him for the first time hes huge easily twice the size he once was and an orangy rocky surface covers his entire body
debbie sees him
fear washes over her not sure what to think
he reaches out a little tentative
she flinches back
oh my g g g
what did you
do to ben
deb its me
its still me
he reaches out
its too much for her
tears swell in her eyes
covering her mouth she backs away
he takes a step closer
she backs away faster tripping over her robe falling into the street
a car screeches to a halt
ben instinctively steps out to help but she scurries back
dont touch me
her shout wakes neighbors
lights flicker on
ben knows he has to go
he looks at debbie sensing this is the last time hell see her
she trembles terrified
his eyes go moist
i love you deb
with that he turns away
the welcome home sign flutters falls to the ground
a tragic tableau
as more lights go on around him ben picks up his pace speeding into the dawn
victor packs a monogrammed armani briefcase vdm emblazoned on a gold plate
leonard waits not so patiently
make sure you find ben bring him back here
and keep it quiet
i dont need this to hit the press
youve got the mayor at eight then a nine thirty interview with the journal front page
top left like you asked
a smile today wall street
tomorrow who knows
victor turns to leonard disappointed with him
we swoop toward this epic monument
on a steel girder above the road we see
he sits on the edge of the beams staring down at the river below brooding muttering
a few days in space itll be great whats the worst that could happen
a pigeon flutters past him and drops a white gooey gift on his shoulder
ben just glares up at the heavens
he hears the sound of someone sobbing
he turns to see
a distraught businessman with a briefcase
the man drops his case which plummets hundreds of feet into the river
the businessman looks out ready to jump
he doesnt see ben or doesnt realize ben is not a statue
you think you got trouble
take a good look pal how bad could it be
the businessman looks at ben terrified
ben steps forward
okay easy there buddy
backpedaling the man slips falling toward the roadway
his arms flail grabbing a narrow beam his fingers hold tight while his legs thrash over speeding traffic
cars and trucks skim right underfoot
ben shakes his head
you had to choose my spot didnt you
ben steps out to help but
his weight bends the beam
the businessman loses his grip
he falls to the road landing hard on the highway
a few pedestrians see ben
ben looks up deer in headlights
he sees a massive truck bearing down on the businessman
this is really not my day
ben drops to the street
he lands in front of the businessman sweeps him out of the way with one arm and turns to the oncoming wheeler cab
the driver slams his brakes eyes wide
the truck swerves but cannot stop
time slows to syrup as ben looks a little scared
he shuts his eyes and
shoulder blocks the incoming truck
a football move
the truck buckles popping a wheelie crumpling all the way to the windshield
it looks like a metal car compactor
the truck swerves hard its tail smashing into steel girders
four lane traffic accident
windows shatter fires flicker
one of the cars in an nypd cruiser
cops clamber out
reed johnny and sue sit in the back
they see the action on the bridge
reed and sue lock eyes sensing the worst
ben stands in the middle of the chaos staring at the destruction
he sees the tow truck driver bleeding trapped in his cab
ben moves to this burning hunk of steel
he swipes through the shattered window and punches the airbag popping it like a kids balloon
he tries to grab the seat belt but his fingers are too big
a little help here
you wanna hit that button sir
the driver is too woozy
ben cant get to the button
frustrated he simply tears off the door and rips the drivers seat right out of the cab
cops round the corner
they see ben holding onto the driver
they raise their guns
ben looks at the cops
pedestrians stare point
he realizes how this must look a monster holding a bloody man in hand
at the back of the traffic jam cars screech to stops
the whole bridge is full of bumper to bumper traffic
we push toward one car three doors pop open and out come
reed johnny sue
they look through smoke and mayhem to see
their first full look at ben
reed stands gutpunched
not even ben deserves that
ben puts the seat down with the driver on it
he lunges behind a truck
the cops try to follow but flames push them back
ben lurches away head down self conscious
he tries to hide from onlookers around him and pedestrians on walkways overhead
he wants to escape but hears screaming motorists
he grits his teeth and moves to help them
reed sue and johnny race toward the flames
all other people head in the opposite direction
bridge police herd the crowd away from the accident
were evac ing the bridge
reed sue and johnny slow down swap glances
what do we do
move in on reed
a first test of leadership
but he is not a leader
sue gets closer to him
bens out there
lets go get him
maybe you didnt hear me
those cars are gonna blow sky high any second
look weve got a friend out there in trouble
we need to get to him before nobody gets past this point
a hard beat
reed signals sue with a look a nod
mutters we need to get past them
he motions to her body
she concentrates and starts to turn invisible
what the hell is this
a magic show
but her clothes dont go invisible
reed mutters sue
she unbuttons her blouse
not thrilled with the idea
she wriggles out of her pants
down to her skivvies
she reaches back to undo her bra
momentarily loses concentration and becomes visible
the sight of sue in her undies grabs the cops attention
everyone watches stunned
the realization that shes visible hits her like a ton of bricks
cops are transfixed
so is reed
this is wrong in so many ways
youve been working out
sue takes a deep breath
closes her eyes
shes embarrassed and furious
any more ideas reed
maybe you should strip down next see how it feels to have fifty people staring and she disappears
she stops ranting
realizes shes gone invisible
the undies drop
the cops stare open mouthed
they turn to look at reed astonished
he sheepishly shrugs his shoulders
im gonna need serious therapy
she walks away
the cops watch her gaping
by the time they turn back around reed and johnny are gone disappearing into the clouds of smoke
a news chopper flies around the bridge fighting for the best angle on the action
reed races through wreckage
he tries to see over a big truck and his neck streeetches
he finally sees
reed wraps around a car and
his face snakes right in front of ben
are you okay
am i okay
you wanna explain that
he motions to reeds neck
then to his own body or this
what the hell am i
cause i sure aint ben anymore
reed opens his mouth but he has no answer
ben spins looking for sue
he cant see her
but he does see
a car inches away with gas tank flaming
the first car blows
empty cars blow in a chain reaction
the flames are mushrooming
reed swipes his arms out holding people back
his arms flatten to form a barricade faces indent his skin
flames lash out
a pack of attractive young women scream
johnny leaps toward them
his feet leave the ground giving him extra lift
he spins lands and embraces the women shielding them from flames which burn up his back
he looks the ladies up and down and gives a cheesy smile
she puts her hands up a normal reflex
the air seems to ripple around her hands like force fields
she looks at them surprised confused
her invisible fields spiral out partially containing the blast
but the flames hurtle closer
she fights the pressure
blood trickles from her nose
just as the white hot blast is about to hit her
sue is dressed again
she screams and pushes the force down into the road
she collapses as the blast deflects off the street and into
an oncoming firetruck
the firetruck is knocked off the ground slewing sideways
its tail slashes out punching through the guard rail
firemen hang off the back and sides
the truck teeters falling
ben wastes no time
he grabs onto the front of the truck just as it goes off the side
he digs his heels into the ground but his feet drag across the concrete digging grooves into the street
on the dangling firetruck firemen climb out clawing toward the bridge
their truck swings
bits and pieces tumble down at them a hose an axe a helmet
all deadly now
the hanging ladder swoops down with men riding on it
straining with all his might
his muscles ripple and
he takes his first step
he is pulling the truck back onto the bridge inch by inch
his footsteps thud
with monumental effort he levels the truck
firemen scurry over hoses and ladders some climbing over ben
reed tends to sue who has fainted from her effort
ben steps back from the truck and slumps to the street exhausted
wary cops close in to cover him with weapons but
the firemen slowly begin to applaud
the crowd of onlookers joins in as well
sue reed and johnny seem surprised touched by the reaction
but ben seems uncomfortable
firemen step forward to offer reed a couple of their coats he hands one to johnny and uses the other to cover sue
ben sees a familiar face in the masses debbie
ben steps toward her but she stops him with a look
she places something on the ground and runs off into the crowd
ben sees something glistening on the ground
he stoops over to pick up
her engagement ring
his big fingers cant grip it
he tries in vain
a hand grabs the ring
i swear to you i will do everything in my power until there is not a breath left in me you are going to be ben again
off the wounded look in bens eyes wanting to believe him
victor sits with remote in hand staring at his plasma tv
on the tv he sees a crowd of firemen applauding the new fantastic four
for the first time they strike a heroic pose
leonard enters with a phone in his hand
larry king called to cancel
seeing the tv a beat apparently theres a bigger story
victor sees reed put his arms around sue as he covers her with the jacket
and the penny drops hes furious
as it hits him he feels something odd
he looks down at his hand
at glints of gleaming metal poking through flesh
an impromptu command center a series of police tents surrounded by emergency vehicles news vans firetrucks
reed sue ben and johnny sit together getting changed
they get ready to go but the chief fireman enters stopping them
theres some folks outside want to talk to you
were not going public with this
were scientists not celebrities
too late son
he turns on a little tv monitor in the corner
news footage plays on all stations with the tagline fantastic four
thats what theyre calling you
the fantastic four
johnny heads for the exit
johnny slow down
lets think this through a second
rubs his chin once
he runs out
sue ben and reed swap glances knowing johnny cannot be their spokesman
they take off after him out to clickclickclick
fifty cameras flash
the field is full of press
our heroes freeze shocked by the crowd
johnny eats up the attention
ben turns self conscious
the chief fireman turns to them
so which one of yous the leader
johnny does not hesitate
thatd be me
sue and ben turn to reed
the chief hands him a mic
youre on son
they all want a statement
all eyes go on reed
he looks out gulps hard
a long beat
uh during our recent mission to the von doom space station we were exposed to as yet unidentified radioactive energy most likely some kind of nucleotide compoun nobody came for
a science class
a crush of questions overwhelms reed what happened on the bridge
does it hurt to stretch
were you really on fire
is it true that one of you can fly
working on it
and its a lot harder we dont know much more than you do at this point
which is why we will be going directly to the lab where we can diagnose our symptoms and symptoms
so its like a disease
reed looks at bens face feeling the guilt
ben is lost in thought looking at debs engagement ring
johnny leaps in
if having powers is a disease then yeah we got it
and we are gonna blow your minds
theres a new day dawning
the day of the fantastic four
that thing doesnt look too fantastic
the reporter nods toward ben
bens fists tighten the sound of rocks crushing together
reed feels the pain
ben grimm is a genuine american hero whos been through a terrible orde what hes trying to say is every team needs a mascot
ben turns his head away
look we went up to space to find a way to understand dna to cure disease save lives
well now its our dna our disease our lives on the line
a beat thank you
no more questions
reed sue and ben get up to go
the press waits a beat then surges
ben spins holding up one finger
the press step back intimidated
flashbulbs pop and bens face freezes
it goes black and white on a new york post in establishing shot of a historic new york building
bankers sit around a table
the lead banker is power broker ned cecil
the men keep their eyes on victor
well victor the bank would like to congratulate you
on the fastest freefall since the depression
we cant even give your stock away
ned you know i can turn this around
ned motions to the paper the picture of ben
you promised a cure all and came back with this
who the hells going to invest in a biotech company that turns its workers into circus freaks
victors grip tightens around the table and
the laptops flicker losing feeds
victor looks down at his hands a private beat did i do that
he lets go of the table screens go back to normal
pointed i really appreciate all your support
youve got a week victor
one week to turn this around
or we pull out
a beat this meeting is over
victor looks at him blood boiling and we cut hard to victor and leonard stride out
victor is writhing
goddamn book keeper doesnt know preferred stock from livestock
leonard is thinking all business
reeds comments at that press conference killed us
how are we going to turn this around
his mind races eyes narrow
i cure them
if i can cure these freaks then i can cure anyone
what better way to restore my reputation
leonard nods impressed
victor is a man in motion
as they step into sunlight we cut to
clickclickclick in reporters snap pictures
a police convoy drives up stopping in front of a towering high rise
sue reed and johnny and get out of a police car
ben steps out of a big paddy wagon which immediately bounces back up to the normal axle position
cops hold back the surging press
ben keeps his head down self conscious
he passes johnny smiling for the cameras
they want to like you
give em your good side
or your less bad side
ben turns to a group of little kids
stiff tentative uh
dont do drugs
the kids flinch
ben trudges on
johnny smiles bright doing hand signs for f
sue pulls him toward the fantastic four enter
they are greeted by jimmy ohoolihan an old time doorman with a kind smile
welcome back to the baxter dr
all that for you
he motions to the flashing cameras outside
im afraid so
he searches for the name
sue steps up
good to see you again
he smiles at sue then at reed
good to see you too
dont worry sir
i know how crowded that head of yours is
any visitors while i was away
just the usual
told em you were circling round outer space
he opens a drawer full of letters from the bank
reed looks sheepish
he shuts the drawer looks to johnny and sue
we had a tough year
yeah nine years straight
reed looks at ben
thanks a lot
elevator doors open
reed hits the top button for the th floor
from outside the place looks a lot taller
oh it is
the doors close but
the elevator does not move
either were moving really fast
or not at all
a digital readout on the panel exceed maximum weight
a sign reads maximum capacity pounds
they turn to ben
ill take the stairs
he lumbers out
as the doors close behind him he looks back over his shoulder locking eyes with reed
the elevator rises
reed roils with guilt
how come ben cant turn it on and off like us
thats what were here to find out
if it happened to him then it could
happen to all of them
reed nods softly
you mean theres chance we could be full on fantastic
grow up johnny
you want to run around on fire for the rest of your life
is that a trick question
cmon i cant be the only one who thinks this is cool
but sue cuts him short with a look
the elevator stops
the elevator opens
they step out
they might be on the th floor but reed owns the building from here to floor sixty
its a massive atrium lit by skylights far above reed leads them into another area filled with separate apartments and all the amenities of home
we should stay here until we can define the extent of our changes
this place is deluxe
you got cable
hearing bens footsteps and figure out how to reverse them
let me show you to your rooms
the press has died down but there are still plenty of cameras
a maybach sedan rolls up
victor emerges wearing sunglasses
this time the press pay no attention to him
no cameras flash
victor tightens and enters the building
sue walks out of the bathroom in a robe drying her hair
she notices a familiar book on a shelf a scrapbook
she flips through it
its filled with pictures of reed and his inventions a lot less fancy than victors multimedia globe
she stops at a picture of her and reed in college
a noise and she turns flinching slightly surprised to see
he smiles standing at the door watching her
god ive been so worried about you
she notices the scar on his head
victor your scar i told you im fine
its you im worried about
im sorry i didnt get a chance to please no apologies
ive arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos
youll have round the clock care
he goes for her bag
but she stops him
a half beat
thank you thats generous but i think i should stay here
with my brother
until we get a handle on this
victor is not used to being rebuffed
he gives a thin smile
i think you should let my doctors have a look at you
a tense beat
made more tense by victor
what are you doing here
they turn to see reed approaching with files in hand
im starting to wonder the same thing
how much do you know about what happened to you
we need to run tests to see the extent of the damage
he looks at sue knowing shes here to stay
well let me know if there is anything i can do
were all in this together now
victor shakes reeds hand
his grip is so tight that reeds fingers stretch
victor lets go and turns to sue who puts her hand out
he smiles and shakes
he heads off
reed looks at his hand
shakes his wrist
he looks at victor
victor moves fast holds tight to his anger
reed catches up
i just wanted to say im sorry the mission didnt go as planned victor suddenly wheels on reed
didnt go as planned
it was a catastrophe
you ruined the lives of four people i ruined
with all due respect i told you to abort abort
reed i put my company my name billions of dollars on the line and i will not let you make me look like a fool victor if we could understand
what happened to us i dont want to understand it
this isnt one of your science projects
i just want to fix it
reed sees victors scar maybe growing
there a problem vic
they turn to see
ben down the hall leaning in a doorway
victor tightens looking at bens massive rock hewn body
no problem ben
he turns back to reed
just pay your goddamn electric bill and get to work on a cure
victor steps away toward the elevator
he passes ben who just smiles and waves goodbye
before victors finger taps the down button the button lights up as if the circuit responded to him
reed exhales shaken
victor steps into the doors close and victor really lets loose
he slams his fist into a steel wall
the wall buckles steel denting
victor shakes out his hand and sees
a rippling metallic shell under the skin
he stares at it in horror
the dark surface pulsates with electric energy
what is he becoming
sue works the controls
reed approaches ben with an electrode needle
he tries to stick the needle into ben but it snaps
you got a chisel round here
if were going to identify the source of the mutation we need to isolate your recombinant dna so we can activate positional genomes
ben looks to sue for translation
we need to give you a physical so we know what got zapped
well why didnt you say so
you want me to lift some weights or something
reed shakes his head
he approaches with an x ray machine
no just sit back
we have a good sense of your strength from the firetruck
we need to find the source of your strength
he turns on the x ray machine
the graph shows solid rock
the rays dont penetrate
sue and reed look confused
how bad is it
you know i used to smoke
reed grabs a blood pressure machine but the strap is way too short to wrap around bens arm
reed stands stumped
he looks at his tray full of instruments
he picks up the little rubber reflex hammer
but it looks miniscule compared to ben
reed has an idea
he opens a drawer full of hardware tools
he pulls of a real hammer
he approaches ben
okay this might smart a little
he taps bens knee lightly and bens leg kicks
right between reeds legs
the ultimate kick in the crotch
reed stretches up a few feet then snaps back wincing
high pitched voice well
continue this later
from their second level control room reed and sue observe johnny in an enclosed fire proof chamber
flames escape through the vents of the chamber
hes fully torched
reed watches the read out it climbs from to degrees kelvin
they are essentially taking his temperature
inside the chamber johnny turns white hot blinding to look at the chamber walls begin to glow red
machines go haywire
his feet even start to lift off the ground levitating a foot or two
he looks down excited burning hotter and hotter
back it down johnny
i can go hotter
he wont stop
reed pulls a switch on the wall
foam sprays out of nozzles dousing johnnys flames
he stands there covered in thick foam
his body steams
so does his temper
youre really cramping my style here
you were at kelvin
any hotter youre approaching supernova sweet
thats the temperature of the sun
not only could you kill yourself but you could set fire to earths atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it
reed looks at the control panels
he cooked the equipment
frustrated reed looks at the smoking system
and we cut to reed and ben sit in chairs facing each other
a beat passes
ben taps his fingers on the chair making small dents
reed looks down at his clipboard
a little awkward
ive uh got some questions from sue
that she thought might be better coming from me
can you you know go to the bathroom
a beat you dont wanna know the details
ben im afraid ive got to ask not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your o kay
well skip that question
reed and johnny now
reed stands nearby
clipboard in hand
is there something about flames
about flaming that you what are you trying to say
just because i dress well and like to dance confused what
im trying to figure out why we each ended up with different symptoms
oh well thats easy im hot
well youre a little limp
sues easy to see through
and bens always been a hardass
a beat why arent you writing this down
its going to be a long process
reed and sue tables turned reed observes her through a prismatic device measuring light refraction
he sees her through the device lit up like some heavenly creature
hes having a hard time concentrating
he focuses on his work
its not invisibility per se
youre bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field
thats what you projected on the bridge
what about you
you havent eaten in days
how come youre never on this side of the microscope
he tightens uncomfortable with being center of attention
she reaches for his arm like a specimen
he pulls away but she sees a glimpse of bruises on his arms
she slows down
from the bridge
he nods rolls down his sleeves
have you had any side effects from your powers
a little vulnerable
ive had some headaches
reed drops his eyes makes a note back to work
you should be able to bend light around other objects even people if you could control your emotional state better excuse me
she is annoyed
reed is oblivious
im saying if you had a little more self control you could locate the trigger
can you remember the exact emotions when anger
is there any way to duplicate that feeling
some memory or
staring right at him im sure i can come up with something
she looks at reed eyes narrow
she becomes invisible
as she focuses on reed and gets angry a small clear force field forms around her body
the force field bends light around a microscope which goes invisible
reed steps out to ask
hows that coming whoa the force field shoots in all directions knocking everything over in a fifteen foot radius
reed is thrown from his chair
im sorry im sorry i didnt mean to do that
you must think that was some kind of latent hostility or what in the world would give me that idea
an awkward beat
i mean you broke up with me right
are you kidding
no i distinctly remember you walked out my door
she didnt want to get into this
she looks down vulnerable
i was ready for the next step you werent ergo i walked
i think it was a little more complicated than i just wanted to share an apartment
what was so complicated about that
the question stumps him
there were a lot of variables to consider no
there was you
no variables no math
it was actually the simplest thing in the world
but your head got in the way
like it always does
her words penetrate
he knows shes right
he looks away
he struggles for the words
same old reed
too much thinking
he opens his mouth but
johnny enters wearing a charred shirt
he points to the burned scraps of his shirt
okay guys we have a serious problem
angles of reed in the lab grabbing their space uniforms from various closets containers our uniforms were exposed to the storm like us
so they can transform like us becoming invisible changing size on demand or remaining impervious to flame
reveal reed sue and johnny step out to look at themselves in a mirror wearing the uniforms
no boots no gloves
the uniforms will develop like our heroes
you look like an eighties rock band
to ben the suit will stretch
you should try it i wouldnt be caught dead in that
these costumes are
i cant put my finger on it theyre not costumes
were not taking them out
johnny we need to stay here till weve stabilized
johnny shakes his head frustrated
im getting sick of being trapped here
nasa wasnt even this strict
he marches out
sue turns to reed who says nothing
sue heads out leaving ben and reed
ben looks at reed
looking at uniform maybe its missing a utility belt
off reeds dark look we hear so whats the prognosis
close on an x ray
the metallic transformation is higher now
pull back to reveal victor and his doctor
in the wall behind them ancient armor maybe we noticed it before maybe not
it adds a little menace to the room
your tissue your organs your entire biophysical structure is changing
every system is still functioning somehow and theyre changing into
i dont really know
a compound organic metallic alloy
stronger than titanium or carbon steel
harder than diamonds like the shields reed said would protect us
cold fury deadly focus how long
at this rate the infection should be complete in two maybe three weeks what do you mean complete
i wish i could tell you
i cant pretend to know what were dealing with here
ill notify the cdc and victor hardens razor sharp
the center for disease control
if this thing is contagious whhm
victor grabs the doctor by the throat
look at me
i have a life
im the face of a billion dollar company
we need to keep this confidential understand
victors grip tightens around the mans throat
thats terrible news
with one cobra swift move victor thrusts his metallic arm into the doctor killing him instantly
victor retracts his arm and looks at it shocked by his own strength
but i think ill get a second opinion
a series of time lapse shots reed works around the baxter building spending hours searching for the cure
he checks charts writes equations paces frustrated
finally he sits at his long desk looking at a wall where bens charts are projected both ben and things anatomies
reed wears the uniform under his labcoat
he checks his equations over and over making notes upon notes
he hits the end of the slides
the wall fills with white light
frustrated reed slams his head into his desk crash
something falls off the end of the desk
reed raises his head revealing his flattened face
he steps over to see
a plant sample from space glass box shattered
red sparks swirl around the plant like the cosmic storm of course
the cosmic storm swirls terrifying
we slowly pull back to the storm is a computer image on screen now
behind the screen are six chalkboards full of reeds calculations and the scribbled beginnings of a machine
we pull back to see his arm stretched across the room writing on the end of another chalkboard
hes moving fast excited almost a little manic
he slows down but doesnt look up to see sue enter
what are you doing
fast charged the plants from space
their particles are still charged
with the right amount of energy those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm
he rifles through a desk drawer then heads out
sue stands there looking at the storm
then we cut to sue follows reed
he flips through a file excited
if we can build a machine to re create the storm we can reverse the polarity realizing and reverse the mutations talking more to himself curing countless diseases not just
she looks at him
but were the focus right reed
and you sure you can control this thing
last time didnt work out so well
preoccupied mind spinning with the right energy we can stabilize the storm
maybe tie into the city grid
he keeps his head down making notes entering reed and sue enter
reed is looking for something
sue slows down staring at this sprawling space jam packed with gear gadgets blueprints inventions
awe inspiring overflowing
you really need to get a janitor
she stares at shelves upon shelves of overcrowded clutter
this must be what it looks like inside your head
reed finds his electron microscope
he turns to sue defensive theres a system to it
she starts to pull out a model of the fantasticar
sue dont touch tha the little car sets the whole shelf off balance
a wave of inventions come clattering down
reed moves fast he lunges toward sue streetching his arms around the shelf pushing sue away just as the inventions smash to the ground
reed and sue hit the floor
a close call
now more closeness sue and reed lay face to face with reeds wrapped around her
a heated beat
their first real intimate moment
as if suddenly made aware of their vulnerability sue and reed stand backing off
as they part we see ben watching from the doorway
we slowly move to
a surveillance camera in a vent grate
victor watches a bank of videoscreens
he has the baxter building under surveillance
he sees reed and sue on monitors
he toys with sues diamond ring in his gloved hand
a door opens
he sees the screens
is reed any closer to a cure
victor looks at that image of reed and sue on the screen
the only thing hes closer to is sue
but victor sees something between reed and sue on the wall
he leans closer and the camera zooms in as if responding to his will
he zooms all the way to a close up of reeds blueprints for the transformation chamber
victors eyes narrow mind ticking a plan forming
make me a reservation for two at cipriani tonight
victor opens a drawer pulls out an old videotape
and get this over to ben grimm
victor leans forward fixated on that machine
as he gets closer his screens go staticky
he absentmindedly picks at his scar
in shadows we see skin peeling off
close your eyes baby
keep em closed
ben grimm stands front and center
not the thing
but ben grimm
a normal man
he smiles wide shaking his head
now we pull back to reveal debbie and ben on a screen
the thing watches the old videotape
he smiles sadly at his old life
he mouths the words he knows this tape by heart
yeah im surprised
surprised the fire department didnt shut this down
on screen the handheld camera whips around revealing
a surprise party
full of people
ben grimm is a popular guy
on screen reed hugs ben
they pose for pictures together
i was good looking
we hear the party sing happy birthday
debbie kisses ben
things eyes start to mist
on screen ben blows out candles
what did you wish for honey
i already got it
everything i want
as they kiss a tear runs down things cheek
the tape ends and he sits in darkness for a beat
a long lonely beat
ben stalks the halls slipping into his ragged trenchcoat
as he passes a crossroads he sees a strange sight reeds hand is tied to a latch in the wall
his arm is streeetched thin spanning around the corner
ben just shakes his head keeps moving
and we follow reeds arm
up the hall
round a corner
down another hall
the muscles and tissue stretch going taut
finally we reach
he steps slowly
he holds a digital tape measure in his other hand measuring distance
his skin streeetches
his face tightens pained
we hear the faint squeak of his skin
reed turns his head around seeing johnny come down the hall
how fars that rubber bend
reed keeps moving slowly
his muscles and tendons laboring
thats what im trying to calculate
and its not rubber
its muscle tendon
i seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to right whatever have fun
and johnny is gone ducking under reeds arm into johnny opens a cupboard pulls out some jiffy pop
it starts to pop in his hand the bag swelling
he casually turns on a tv flipping to
the x games
the jiffy pop swells ready to blow
he rips it open eats popcorn and watches the games cool stunts hot girls
johnnys brow furrows a thought forming a mischievous smile on his lips
a figure exits wearing that ragged trenchcoat and fedora
ben disappears into the dark night and we cut to dark
steam rises through the grates
a shadow emerges
he heads toward odonnels pub a classic brooklyn tavern
music life inside
ben pulls his hat low turns up his collar and squeezes through the door into a big photo of ben grimm in his astronaut heyday occupies a place over the
ben enters and the bar goes silent
he moves through the crowd
people clear out of the way
ben reaches the bar
he sits on a stool and crunch
the stool snaps like a toothpick
he hits the ground hard
a few patrons smile laugh softly
thats not funny
they go silent
they drop bills onto tables filing out scared of this monster
ernie works the bar
hey thats ben grimm there the first mook from brooklyn to go to outer space so pay him some respect
but the patrons keep filing out
ben looks down weary
sorry for killing your business
ill take the usual then im out
better make it a double
ernie heads for the booze
ben gives a sad shake of his head
then he notices
one lone patron at the end of the bar
a beautiful young woman nursing a drink
meet alicia who killed the party
she turns to him unafraid
he notices her blank stare lack of focus and white cane
alicia is blind
make it a triple
on the house benny
ben takes his drink but smash
his grip shatters the glass spilling all over himself
he smiles ruefully
if theres a god she hates me
he grabs a bar rag to dry off
i dont think shes real big on hate
you wouldnt say that if you could see me
she knocks back her drink grabs her cane steps toward ben
ben doesnt say anything
a little unnerved by this woman
its okay i wont bite
feeling his arm not that i could
she puts a hand on his face something in her tone and gentle touch allows ben to let her
she smiles softly
such a sad face
you know sometimes being different isnt a bad thing
trust me this aint one of those times
she smiles softly takes her cane and starts to head out
see you round benny
right as she hits the door over her shoulder im alicia by the way
ben watches her disappear
he sees a few people staring
he lowers his head turns back to the bar and finds a new drink in a steel martini shaker
he knocks it back
a maitre d leads us through fancy digs
heads turn whispers flutter
sue steps out joining
victor at a prime table
he pulls out her chair wearing gloves
thank you for coming out to see me
she nods a little self conscious
you said it was urgent
theres something we need to talk about
something i need to ask you
sue senses where this is going and she cuts it short
slow careful victor wait slow down a second
i want you to know i appreciate everything youve done for me but i just dont susan
what are you doing
he is cold as ice
if hes hurt hell never show it
you think i brought you here to talk about us
this is business
leaning forward intense i need to know how close is reed to finding to a cure
then hes working round the clock
but the data needs to be tested analyzed before same old reed
all analysis no action
wasnt that the problem with you two
she holds tight keeping cool
if these molecules arent stable they could make us worse maybe even kill us
then why is reed dragging his feet
maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass
closer cruel its ironic isnt it
youre finally the perfect woman for him
because youre his science project
the words sting
she cant help but hear some truth in them
please dont make this personal oh i think you already have
victor we cant do anything until the research is ready
victors fist clenches metal sfx
victor screeches his chair back pushing the table so hard that he spills water
heads turn all eyes on sue
victor gets close to her too close a hand on her shoulder
dont forget who you work for susan
so get to work
and do your job
he walks out
as he goes he slips the engagement ring out of his pocket
he crushes the diamond to dust leaves the dust in an ashtray and disappears into the night
sue sits embarrassed
she walks out invisible save for her clothes which drift through the air
at a table full of businessmen i wish my wife would disappear
the other men laugh but whhm
the mans wine spills into his lap
sue walks out
the restaurant is left buzzing
and we fade out
then we crash the x games in full effect a maze of mountainous dirt hills and ramps
where moto bikes launch into the air to the delight of fans
the riders spin and flip performing aerial acrobatics on their cc motor bikes
and now ladies and gentlemen we have a special guest for you
johnny storm of the fantastic four
johnny emerges wearing his blue uniform waving to the crowd
he steps up to the pit where riders prep
he beelines to ronnie renner
hey ronnie renner
im a big fan
ronnie gives a tight nod
he doesnt like being upstaged by this circus freak
the other bikers approach
heard you like to ride
wanna take her for a spin
he motions to his bike
johnny eyes this mean machine
come on bro
ill teach you some tricks
if you can keep up
we push in on johnny his ego getting stoked as we cut to ronnie jams down the track kicking dirt back at johnny
johnny now wears a motocross outfit over his uniform with the number on the back and a small over his heart
ronnie hits the first hill and catches air flipping high
a rock solid double flip
the crowd goes wild
now its johnnys turn
he hits the hill and pulls the exact same move
with even more height
look at that lift ladies and gentlemen
johnny sticks the landing
the crowd swells
ronnie tightens pulls his throttle harder taking the next jump and
making an insane move corkscrewing in the air
hes totally flat and whipped
he lands clean
the crowd is ready to explode
johnny revs his engine his body starting to steam adrenaline burning
he hits the hill and pulls an even gnarlier spin
what is that
the crowd roars
ronnie bears down on the last hill
he leans over his handlebars
hes going for a kiss of death
ronnie hits the hill pulls this jaw dropping death defying stunt
the crowd is deafening
johnny speeds faster faster
trails of flame start to streak off his back
he races like a rocket up the hill
and now for the really impressive part johnnys bike starts to drop but johnny keeps rising
he flames on spiraling upward
for a few seconds hes actually
hand over mic is he
he plummets back down
lands on his bike in mid air
and sticks a perfect landing maybe even kicking a little dirt up at ronnie
johnny swerves to a stop with a holy shit look on his face
what the hell just happened
unbelievable ladies and gentlemen
youve just seen the first
a new name is born
the crowd goes berserk
riders rush up to johnny
kenny sees his bike the seat melted wheels burned off
sorry about that
a glance to ronnie thanks for the lesson bro
hot girls swarm
as johnny gets swallowed by fans we see a scary thing flicker in his eyes the birth of a star
sue stands alone sifting through piles of mail
she focuses on one piece of mail that shes holding
her hand begins to disappear and then the envelope slowly begins to disappear as well
sue smiles at the success
quiet thats new
reed enters overworked unshaved
he keeps his head down preoccupied
sue shifts focus
have you read these
from all over
people want us to fight crimes
save their kids
solve their problems
no response from reed when we cant even solve our own
she puts the letters down steps closer to reed
how close are we to a cure
no way to know
without more tests experiments
victors words echo in her head
were not specimens were patients
this isnt just another science project to you is it
reed looks up a little surprised
he opens his mouth but crash
ben stalks around the room furious
reed and sue rush in
whats going on
ben points to the wall sized tv the espn moto x games
so what can you tell us about the outfit
reveal johnny standing next to an x games reporter
he is peeling off the burned remains of his motocross outfit revealing his ff uniform with a stitched onto the chest
behind them step up riders launch their moto bikes off huge high mountains of dirt thirty feet in the air
not too much but i will say that its all weather and no leather
kind of armani meets astronaut
ben sue and reed stare at the wall sized tv
oh he did
what did he do to the uniform
she turns to reed who gives a sheepish shrug and peels back his labcoat revealing a stitched onto his chest too
he talked me into it
so what are your superhero names
i go by the human torch
the ladies call me torch
what about the rest of the team
johnny hadnt really thought about them
he spitballs uh we call my sister the invisible girl
the invisible girl
thats easy to remember
and reed richards
hes the leader
so whats he
well i wouldnt say hes the leader
he doesnt hate the name
could be worse
case in point a photo of ben fills the tv
what about this one
what do you call this thing
johnny smiles looking right into camera
just the thing
we would have gone with the rock but it was taken
and thing pretty much sums it up
a laugh from the studio audience
matter of fact okay
im gonna go kill him now
he turns to go
reed wraps an arm around ben
slow down a second and he sees a photo of himself on screen
is it true what they say
that he can expand any part of his anatomy
actually between us i think hes got some problems staying rigid
finishing his thought to ben wait for me
which may explain why this womans not smiling
they put up a shot of susan
thats my sister
the thing rounds the corner
sees a crowd of girls lined up near a red porsche parked out front
with torched on the plates
ben slows down smiles
johnny and the hot babe exit signing autographs for girls in the line
sue and reed approach glare like angry parents
johnny finds the valet who looks ill
his car is gone
looking around wheres my ride
the valet blows his whistle
and a x solid cube of red junk metal slides down the street and stops at the curb in front of johnny
the valet timidly holds out the keys
is that my before he can finish johnny gets pelted in the head with the license plate
it rattles to the ground face up
johnny rubs the sting out of his head
looks up and sees ben in the distance dusting off his hands
shouting to ben youre gonna pay for that pebbles
seeing sue what
you gave us names
what are you the face of the fantastic four now
ben marches up
hands balled into fists
its about to be a broken face
this isnt permanent johnny
we need to be careful until were normal again
what if some of us dont want to be normal again
we didnt all turn into monsters like ben reels back a fist the size of an anvil
instead of attacking he starts to walk off
johnny hurls a fireball that smacks ben in the back of the head
turns around more shocked than hurt
did you just ben gets hit with another fireball
this time in the face
okay thats it tinkerbell
you want to fly
ben charges like a bull fist cocked back and
reed steps in the way
bens fist punches into reeds chest which indents
reeds back expands with bens fist punching into johnny launching johnny off his feet
johnny slams into a moving advertising truck with a burger king flame broiled whopper on the side
he leaves a flaming imprint on the all beef patty
the crowd stands stunned
so do reed and sue
johnny slowly pulls himself up
the paint on the truck begins to bubble around his hand
beaten bruised he stands
both his hands are now flaming fists of fury
lets see if we can get blood from a stone
he and ben lock eyes with a block of sidewalk between them
they start to run toward each other
when they are almost within range sue steps between them stops them both in their tracks with just a look
like a mom you two need a time out
blockhead started it
ben just stalks off
the crowd clears scared
a paparazzi snaps a picture
ben grabs his camera and flicks the lens
sue looks at johnny more disappointed than angry
damn it johnny
she goes after ben leaving reed and johnny on the sidewalk
you need to control yourself and think before you act
here we go again
reed what if we got these gifts for a reason
what if we have some you know
a higher calling like getting girls and making money
johnny nods totally missing the sarcasm
is there any higher
reed looks at him disgusted
johnny waves to the crowd hand flaming
people shriek snap pictures
johnny smiles at reed
this is who we are reed
or better yet enjoy it
johnny steps into the sea of fans
reed stands alone
sue wades through the throng of new yorkers
tries to catch up with ben
whose presence parts the crowd like moses
ben glances sideways at her doesnt stop
she catches up
he didnt mean it
you know johnny
hes always been a hothead its not him
pointing to crowd i cant live like this
just give reed a little more time
you know how he works analyzing every little step before he takes one its easy for you to be patient
no its not
i thought i was done waiting for reed
were all in this together now ben
he slows down gets closer intense
look at me susie
you got no idea what id give
to be invisible
is my dream
she opens her mouth but has no response
she doesnt know his depth of pain
as he disappears into the alley we cut the news plays on the tv
head banker ned cecil freezes the screen on an image of
he turns to victor who sits with the rest of the bankers
cold sterile environment
this is how you turn things around
these freaks are on the front page and your companys in the obituaries
victor has a larger bandage on his face now
i have a plan to use their publicity for victor stop
the banks lost enough already
this isnt a negotiation
its a notification
were pulling out
a cold silent beat
victor leans forward
you need to look long term here
without risk theres no reward
we all know the sales pitch vic
and frankly were done buying
he motions to his men
they all stand
victor is the lone man sitting
push in on victors face his inner rage palpable
a few quick surges of electricity emanate from his body
this man is getting stronger more electric
the floor is slick with water puddles in every direction
ned cecil comes out of the elevator heading for his car
as he goes the structure lights start to flicker
ned looks up watches the lights go out one by one furthest to closest
he looks around
unnerved by the darkness
a hanging beat
victor steps out from shadows
relieved almost von doom
gave me a little shock
no hard feelings right
victor says nothing
ned keeps going
you know you could always move back to latvura start fresh
he mispronounces latveria dripping condescension
maybe thats where you belong back in the old country
that does it
a surge of electricity courses through victor
his eyes narrow and the electricity crackles down his leg to the ground
the electric spark hits the water and
lightning fast across the water like deadly electric snakes heading straight for ned
his eyes go wide
ned is electrocuted
his body spasms
he slumps dead
smoke rises from his body
victor stands power swelling
for the first time his scar splits open revealing a metal glow beneath the skin
he remains scary calm
its pronounced latveria
looking down at the dead body this meetings over ned
victor walks away the final lights going to darkness
victor enters still adrenalized
he turns to the light switch and the lights come on
he approaches his screens and the monitors flicker to life
his powers are growing
one monitor rolls the news
images of the fantastic four
victor leans closer and the volume automatically goes up
the fantastic four put on quite a show last night
they landed in every major headline in the northern hemisphere
in related news
an image of victor on screen
reports have surfaced that von doom industries may be filing for bankruptcy
you may remember that it was victor von doom who
victor turns away from the screen
the volume goes down
he focuses his eyes on reed
leonard enters stepping closer seeing the faint flicker of victors metallic scar
his eyes narrow concerned
sir is everything okay
what happened to your
victor keeps his eyes on the screen totally engrossed
under breath seething reed
he got what he wanted
looking at sue everything he wanted
he took from me
he leans ever closer so the static starts to swallow reed
a hard deadly beat
victors eyes narrow zooming into
reeds research slides on the wall
he zooms into key words danger unstable ions mutation overload
and victor gives a slow thin smile
a new plan forming
now im going to take it back
piece by bloody piece
his fist clenches
we hear metallic sfx
reed enters the room carrying a stack of boxes that no normal man could balance
but he is not normal
his arms are wrapped around the boxes five times over like human twine
he stops short and drops the boxes when he sees
victor overseeing a group of technicians
they are boxing up reeds work all of his equipment research
victor wears a bandage covering his scar
reed eyes a glint of metal
victor are you
are you okay
victor turns away
dont worry about me
worry about yourself
reed looks around seeing his lab turned inside out
what are you doing here
what i should have done a long time ago
applications and patents reed
this all belongs to me
reed reaches out grabbing a folder from a box
but im not done with the machine which is precisely the point
analysis is over
its time for action
my men could have mass produced this by now
reed shakes his head defending himself
this isnt a toaster
you have no idea how it works
victor pulls the folder from reeds hand and whips out the intricate diagram of the machine
he points to parts re create the storm invert the polarity here reverse the mutation there
dont talk to me like im some schoolboy
ive got the same phd you do
reed is a little surprised that victor is so familiar with his machine
he points to a secure chamber on the blueprint
the storm needs to be handled exactly right or it could make our mutations worse much worse maybe even kill us
is reed getting to him
or giving him ideas
we need time to verify the data
we cant afford any mistakes theres only enough ions for two or three attempts
he seems to enjoy watching reed dangle
im not asking permission
a final verdict well build it while you check the specs
victor walks out
reed looks unsure as we cut to the shields slowly rise
five technicians go to work
they wear the vdi jackets
reed watches worried
she sees the shields the technicians the vdi logo
and she is deeply worried
she steps over to reed
sparks fly behind them
can i talk to you
sue steps into the office followed by reed
quiet urgent dont let victor push you into making a mistake he was going to take away all my data equipment better than your life
victors not the one who has to get into that thing
reed starts to snap losing his studied cool
which is why im working twenty hours a day checking every variable every variable but yourself
you dont eat sleep
you cant live in your head like finally losing it im not the only one in there
i got you vic ben johnny all rattling around in there
sue stands there shocked by his outburst
so clear it out
get out of your head
get out of here
he looks at her knowing what she means
where she means
ben nearly knocks people over as he stomps down the street mind tossing and turning
people stare point
a little girl and friend run up to him
please help me
my kitty is stuck in a tree
she gestures to a tree next to ben
please save miss lucy
ben rolls his eyes
considers climbing the tree but thinks better of it
he has another idea
ben grabs the tree with one hand and starts shaking the crap out of it
the cat falls into frame
at the last instant ben sticks out his hand and the cat lands safely in his palm
he hands the cat to the girl
barely acknowledges her profuse thanks
he just moves on
ben passes a window in a gallery and almost misses a large sculpture of his bust
he stops steps back to take a look
its exquisitely rendered capturing not just brute physicality but the haunting anguish in his eyes
ben is amazed and touched but
under breath eyebrows are a little big
he stares at these images of himself
i figured the only way to get you here was to stick that in the window
he turns to see
alicia in the doorway
howd you know it was me
im blind not deaf
wanna come in
he steps toward her
but he sees
a party in the back part of the gallery
ben pauses a little insecure
im not really dressed for a party
relax its casual
no i mean
im a little
she smiles a thought forming as we cut to whoosh
a sculptors hose sprays a thin stream of water at ben
alicia cleans ben with her hands using thin carving chisels for his cracks
intricate intimate work
ben enjoys every moment
he eyes a couple large puppets in the corner
those yours too
my step dads
im strictly into stone
i was wondering when youd walk by
you know you coulda run an ad in the personals
sensual blind chick seeks three ton rock hard he man for deep spiritual relationship
this aint permanent
my friend reeds working on a cure
she gets closer running her hands across his arm
you feel pretty good as is
he doesnt want to stay this way
you dont know what its like out there
walking around like some kind of circus freak
people staring whispering i wouldnt know anything about that
when you grew up in brooklyn how many astronauts did you know
a beat you went your own way then
you didnt listen to people
so why start now
as he ponders that we hear a crowd swelling on the cut to fans swarm johnny
he signs autographs poses for pictures
then his eyes move to
an incredibly long stretch limo
a tinted window rolls down
victors face emerges
need a ride johnny
johnny climbs in sees
three impossibly gorgeous models
a few fans
hope you dont mind
gotta take care of the fans right
he smiles sitting down in the middle of them
look i built my business knowing what people want
and right now the people want you
johnny eyes the models all lusting
and we dont want to let the people down now do we
no we dont
which is why we need to strike while the irons hot
im talking action figures videogames sponsors videogames
victor nods knowing he has johnny on the hook
you talk to reed and sue about this
lets be honest here
ben reed sue
good people all
shaking his head a beat i dont want to break up the band but youre the one they want
dont you think its time to go solo
victor subtly nods to the models
they envelop johnny
take the car for a spin
think about it
is this the life you want
or would you rather live in reeds lab
the car stops
victor gets out
he stands on the pavement
as he shuts the door we see the women climbing onto johnny
the door shuts and
the windows all suddenly steam up
stars on the ceiling
a voice drones about the galaxy
in the last row we find reed and sue
reed is thinking about work
i could get ben to tap into the baxters main power to generate enough voltage reed
just be quiet
and look up
he slowly looks up
the stars seem to calm him
remember our first date here
god i was so nervous
of course i was
id read all your papers on bioethics
some of them two times just so id have something to say to you
reed smiles softly thinking back
you know i bribed the projectionist ten bucks to keep it open late
i gave him twenty
sue looks up to the stars
quiet i didnt want that night to end
reed looks at her
wrestles with a decision
then quietly sue you were right
it wasnt complicated
i just wasnt ready to be
a beat you can be a little intimidating
he trails off
sue looks at him
you always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you
speak his mind
one who wasnt afraid to tell you what he wanted
i did reed
but i wanted you to be that man
someone shushes them
they slump down further
when i walked out i waited ten minutes outside your door
waiting for you to come find me
why didnt you say something
that would have kinda defeated the purpose
closer emotional im saying it now
their eyes lock
a heated beat
no more secrets
their faces are close
a kiss is coming
quiet playful come find me
reed tentatively leans into the kiss and
thats my nose genius
these are my lips
reeds face is squeezed on both sides by sues invisible hands
she pulls him into a kiss
and we slowly dissolve to ben and alicia step out together
the crowd quiets turns
a few whispers flutter
alicia leans close to ben and slips her arm into his
the party goes back to normal
ill get us drinks
they always let blind girls cut the line
she walks off
he watches her go
the way her hair moves
the lines of her neck
the light on her skin
this woman is the most beautiful thing ben has ever seen
hes falling hard
ben steps through the crowd
the swanky guests give strained smiles polite
ben is starting to feel comfortable here
he keeps his eyes on alicia who talks to guests
ben hangs back happy to watch her
a few patrons pass him thinking hes just an inanimate statue
i dont know about this one
it lacks a certain
ben keeps his eyes on alicia
he overhears two bohemian girls who assume hes a statue
shes always had a thing for runaways and strays but this is ridiculous
did she really think these sculptures would sell
like anybody would want this thing in their house
that girls a one woman charity
ben just stands there frozen
his eyes dart around the room paranoid now
aware of people staring laughing
he glances at alicia who giggles at something else
ten seconds ago this would have been dreamy
now its damning
we stay with alicia who cuts through the crowd emerging where she left ben
she has a pitcher of wine in hand for him
but ben is gone
she looks disappointed hearing his heavy footsteps get softer and softer in the distance
thunder booms on the cut to a pitstop in queens
heavy rain swims down windows
ben sits at the counter with his hat pulled low coat tight
nobody sits within four chairs of him
he sips coffee in a metal bowl
a long beat
this seat taken
ben turns to see
what are you doing here
im worried about you
let me buy you something to eat
looks like you could use the company
a man deeply alone
victor and ben sit in a window booth
a waitress sets a foothigh stack of pancakes in front of ben removes huge plates hes just cleared
victors aware of the other customers in the diner staring at ben
ben burps it rattles the plates
i know it cant be easy
life hasnt changed that much for reed sue and johnny
at least they can go out in public
but for you
whispering behind your back
if youre trying to cheer me up youre doing a helluva job im just saying i know what its like to lose something you love
to see it slip away and know its never coming back
the thing shoves a huge piece of pie in his mouth
reeds gonna fix me up for your sake i hope youre right
im sorry if that sounds a little skeptical
ben doesnt trust him
but victor is hitting pressure points
look hes a brilliant man we should trust hes working as hard as he can
youre his best friend
so what possible reason could he have for taking his time
a beat i mean other than getting close to sue
off the thing a seed of doubt has been planted
he cant help but find truth in the words
and we cut to reed and sue return laughing quietly bodies close
reed turns on the lights and they flinch when they see
he sits waiting scowling
they stop laughing immediately
yeah i have that effect on people
the construction of the transformation chamber is complete
the technicians are gone now
ben oh you remember my name do you
you happen to remember what you swore to do with every breath in your body
were working as hard as we can yeah
i can tell
victor was right
he motions to reed and sue together
come on this is nothing
sue looks a little hurt
glad nothing could take you away from your work
ben i dont know if this thingll change us back or make us worse
i need you to be patient for a little while longe he pokes his finger into reeds chest which indents around it like the pillsbury doughboy
ben pushes reed back
look at me reed
look at me
he grabs reeds face his fingers indenting the skin
he throws reed back
reed slams down to the ground
i am looking
thats why i cant make a mistake
ive got to get it right and its not right yet
we need to test this
ben shakes his head looking down at reed
i spent my whole life protecting you from the schoolyard to the stars
so you could play twister with your girlfriend while im the freak of the week
reed tries to stand but ben knocks him back
reed slams into the wall and stays down this time
or ill stop it
she starts to raise her hands to throw force fields
stay out of this susie
as ben turns to her reed takes this opportunity to wrap ben up like a python
ben runs back into a wall to shake reed
their faces are close heated
good thing youre flexible enough to watch your own back
cause youre on your own now
ben seems to relax and reed lets go
ben walks out
sue comes to reeds side
just go go after him
she heads out
reed slowly stands
he looks at the transformation machine
its not ready
reed steps toward it
as he walks his image goes grainy in victor gets closer to his screens watching reeds every step
this is what victor has been waiting for
his screens flicker with static hes too close but he cant pull back
he sees reed turns on the machine
hits a countdown
and he grabs his uniform
sue hustles down the long hall
ben turns a corner passing the elevators heading toward a freight elevator
she gets there too late
doors close going down
ben pounds across the lobby
he sees johnny coming in
christmas come early
check it out
he holds up an action figure of ben a horribly bloated body topped by a tiny pinhead
johnny pushes a button and with one arm ben shoves johnny into a wall
with his other hand ben grabs the toy and smashes it into the wall inches from johnnys head
the toy lodges into the plaster
thats a prototype
go back to the drawing board
he strides away
sue speeds out of the elevator
no sign of ben
she runs into
johnny who shakes off the encounter
did you see ben
yeah for the last time i hope
im done with this freak show
im moving back to the real world
is that what you call it
at least it beats living in a lab like somebodys science project
this hits home
sue is quiet
johnny turns to go
johnny slow down
you know mom didnt raise us to look around sis
shes not here
so you can stop talking to me like im your little boy as soon as you stop acting like one
come on youre smarter than this
you think those people out there care about you
youre just a fad to them
he pulls away from her taking a step out the door
lets try something new you live your life
and ill live mine
beat and just for the record they love me
he strides into the night leaving sue alone
a dark night
the fantastic four is no more
the family is split apart
the transformation chamber is up and running
numbers count down
the storm swirls in the chamber
reed now wears the uniform
he opens the door victor sits enthralled
he leans forward breathless
reed gets closer
his heart races
so does victors
a moment of truth for both of them
reed steps into the reed looks up at the cosmic storm
he opens his arms ready to risk his life
he jolts in jump cut motion reconfiguring jerking out of control and we cut to his screens go black
he looks out the window to see
a flash atop the baxter building
the tip of the baxter glows
the rest of its lights go out flickering in a power surge
lights go haywire
sue knows immediately
oh god reed
lights flicker in darkness
the door rips open
sue lunges inside
she sees through smoke and sparks
reed sways in the chamber
did it work
reed slumps to the ground
his eyes flutter back
his body is warped twisted one half remains tense hard while the other half is loose soft almost melted
what did you do reed
what did you do
victor watches every second on his monitors
sue struggles to lift reed half of his body is stretched out devoid of any semblance of bone structure
one side of his face looks like its melting off
make it work
reed stop you need to rest your the power
the storm you need a doctor
reed loses consciousness
sue carries him out
victor watches his eyes narrow looking at his hands
he reaches out for his phone and
his speakerphone automatically turns on
his powers growing
bring me our lab rat
ben sits alone looking at city lights
a man without a home
without a family
a hard beat
headlights slash across ben
he slowly turns blinded in the lights of
they need you back at the baxter building
despite it all hes a good friend
and a good man
as he gets into the car we hear throbbing music loud music and pulsating lights
a young crowd dances and grinds to the beat
among the colorful lights streaks of flame swirl around the ceiling
we follow them to a balcony where we see johnny sitting in a cozy vip section
hes surrounded by groupies climbing over each other to get a look at his various parlour tricks
he leans closer to a young woman
candles around them start to melt
beads of sweat drip down her face
what do you say we get out of here
a very large man steps up
this your boyfriend
the boyfriend doesnt look too happy
is that all you do
bar tricks and stealing chicks
johnny does one more trick
taps the guys drink
igniting it into a burst of flame
the boyfriend drops the glass which smashes on the ground
catches the floor on fire
the boyfriend quickly moves in and stamps it out
what are you doing
you could have burned somebody
the boyfriend takes his girlfriends hand they start to walk off
she turns back for one last comment
you know if i had your power id be doing something with it not wasting my time doing cheap bar tricks hitting on some other guys girl
johnny looks a little embarrassed
the couple leaves
johnny glances around
his fans look down away
he sees how quickly they can turn
the crowd parts slightly
he looks very alone
leonard leads the thing inside
the ominous chamber sits with its door open
victor enters from the control station
ben come in
what is this
where do you think
ben looks at the flickering lights
victor turns to leonard who looks a little scared by this dark room
quiet ill take it from here leonard
leonard nods all too eager to get the hell out of here
leonard disappears fast as victor turns back to ben
what do you want vic
to help you
ive run every test known to man
and they all yield the same result the machine is ready
ben shakes his head wanting to believe but
reed said itd be weeks till he also said wed avoid that storm in space
and we know how that turned out
reed was wrong before
ben gets closer to the machine drawn to it
he wants to believe so badly
he couldnt generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass
yet another mistake for mr
and you can
power it up
victor stands in shadows but we see the tiniest little spark around him
or his skin
ive found a new energy source
he keeps his arm behind his back his fingertips course with electricity
it starts to build sparking up his arm
do you want to be ben grimm again
ben keeps his eyes on the machine
his dream is alive
lets do it
the chamber doors open
he looks around this sterile box
an animal in a cage
victor pushes a control the doors of the chamber slowly close and seal
thing shuts his eyes
he just wants to be ben again
from the controls victor initiates the transformation sequence
as lights go on inside the chamber they dim in the lab
energy pumps into the chamber
the storm swirls faster
theres not enough power until victor walks over
grabs hold of the machine with both hands
a countdown begins in the control panels
slow move in on the chamber the things face in the window
the chamber activates
the storm strikes hard
the thing opens his mouth a beat then he screams in agony
struggling violently inside
extend the moment condensation obscures the chamber window the thing vanishes
the city lights fill the sky and give it a quiet eerie glow
suddenly a bright flash emerges from the window of the baxter building
the rest of the city lights dim slightly
reed lies in bed weak recuperating
when the power surges we move in on him he looks up in alarm knowing that someones using the chamber
he starts to get out of bed straining to stand with every muscle left in his body
sue sifts through a cabinet full of medications
the lights dim
she looks up
johnny walks alone
a wave of light spreads through the sky
he looks up
his eyes adjust to the blast as he realizes where its coming from
he starts running toward the baxter
inside the machine the red cloud swirls with debris crackling with light
the chamber rattles dangerously as the power seems to shake the very foundation of the building
and then its over
the light dies down
it still pulses along with the chamber
the chamber door slides beat
ben grimm steps out
not the thing
no more rocks
naked tired but finally a normal man
he slips on his trench coat now way too large
he stares at his hands his arms
oh my god
th thank you
thank ben sees a spark in shadows
that spark is
victor steps forward and reveals himself to ben electricity pumps through his body
his skin is part flesh part metal
cheekbone exposed steel tissue
everyone thought i was safe behind those shields
victor the machine worked for me
it can work for you it did ben
it worked perfectly
ben starts to realize
you planned this
doom smiles reaches out his hand electricity builds from his shoulders coursing down his arms to his fingertips
ive always wanted power
now ive got an unlimited supply
and no thing to stand in your way
doom smiles nods stronger than ben now
take a good look ben
this is what a man looks like who embraces his destiny
doom clenches his fist and blasts ben sending him flying backwards across the room knocked unconscious
one down three to go
the lab door flies open
doom steps back into the shadows
right on cue
reeds eyes go wide
he sees ben crumpled in the corner
oh god ben
are you okay
amazed you did it you really did it
reed slowly turns to see
his body his face
what what happened to you
what did you do to your exactly what i said i would i built a better stronger being
and outsmarted the great reed richards victor this isnt the way to a dark smile you always know best
so tell me
what happens when you superheat rubber
doom blasts an electrical bolt at reed knocking reed through the huge window
reeds body rubber bands from the blast
reed slinkies down the face of the building skin rippling
doom looks out the window smiling at his old friends fall
the elevator opens
doom strides out
he passes our friend ohoolihan who looks scared
are you oka doom casually swipes sending him through revolving doors
never better jimmy
and its doctor doom now
reed melts down the sides of an awning like a salvador dali watch
he tries to grab hold of window ledges but he cant get a grip
his arm streeetches and snap
he falls like a slinky out of control
half his body loose half hard
he drips to the sidewalk where
doom steps out
he catches reeds face holds it close
why the long face
doom whips reed into the night
as doom turns people cower horrified by his face
they clear out and
doom sees his reflection in a window scarred skin metallic veins
infuriated he shatters the window with an iron fist and bounds into the night
smoke billows windows are shattered
sue races inside seeing dooms devastation
silence deadly silence
she sees a pile of wreckage shift
ben crawls out
she helps him out of the rubble
he is beaten battered
johnny comes running in
he sees the wreckage
im sorry sis for leaving you guys no im sorry for pushing you out
a beat between them
he looks around sees ben
eyeing him i go away look what happens
you got a lot of explaining to do
he motions to the wreckage
struggling weak the machine works
and vics gone mister hyde on us really
with a name like von doom
never saw that one coming
sue looks around
only one question
dead serious where is reed
victor mustve taken him
doom sits at the head of the table in an eerie parallel to the opening scene
those mysterious crates loom in shadows
he wears a green hood and metal mask over his scarred face
dooms eyes turn toward
the other end of the table
chemistry part two
what happens to rubber when its super cooled
we now see what he sees reed sits in a chair with tubes injected into his skin freezing him solid
ultra cold vapor coats him
doom steps closer a sadistic smile
reed tries to move but cant even ball his hand into a fist
he presses down on one of reeds fingers which makes a horrific cracking sound
reeds face twists with pain
doom seems to enjoy every crack
he leans closer
you dont know the meaning of the word
doom lets up on reed and reaches into a crate and pulls out a military issue rocket launcher
he aims at the city skyline locking onto his target johnny storm
but you will
johnnys heat signature glows
the screen flashes target acquired
doom looks back at reed his launcher aimed casually over his shoulder
he fires without looking
a missile blasts into the sky
the missile lights up the dark night beginning its wide turn towards its target
johnny ben and sue hear the missile being fired and turn to the window it banks coming straight for them
they move to johnny rushes toward the edge to get a good look at the missile streaking closer
as he moves the missile shifts slightly with his motion
his eyes narrow thinking
he flames on a hand
he waves his flaming hand and the missile locks onto the fire
johnny darkens realizing
his mind races
he makes a decision and steps up onto the ledge hundreds of feet above the street
what are you doing sis
let me take care of you for once
you cant fly
johnny considers a half beat
he looks out
under breath well then thisll be one hell of a basejump
sue reaches out to stop him but johnny dives heroically off the edge
he flames on
the missile follows his arc
as he drops his clothes burn off revealing his uniform
under breath come on
he falls lower lower
sue watches with fear and a hint of pride
we need to help reed sue shakes her head sympathetic
ben you got what we all wanted
you need to stay here
its too dangerous
she heads off
ben watches her go helpless
ben steps back into this ravaged room
through the shattered window he sees johnnys flames streaking away
a hard beat
what have i done
johnny zigs and zags but the missile takes every twist and turn gaining on him bearing down
cars slow stop
more people look up scared pointing at this stunning sight
reed tries to move but he is frozen
he hears a footstep
but the room is empty
no sign of doom even
he hears a creak
another creak closer
a freezing tube starts to shift
it goes taut clearly being manipulated by a hand an invisible hand
sue appears next to reed tube in hand
she tries to stay calm
what has he done to you
reeds eyes shift to see
doom emerge from the darkness
victor please its doctor doom to you
he steps closer
electrodes course over his metal skin
we know the machine works
it worked on ben itll work on you
we can turn you back do you really think fate turned us into gods so we could refuse these gifts
she hardens a little force field starts to emanate from her
you always thought you were god
doom has a hand behind his back generating an energy blast
sue please lets not fight
she hurls a force field at him
it connects knocking him back a half step
but he simply shakes it off and steps up
his arms crackle with electricity
he fires an electric shockwave that launches her back
she spirals through the air crashing into the wall thudding to the floor
as doom stalks closer sue gathers her strength to
a hanging beat
we see a faint outline of sue behind him
he spins grabs her
doom grips her neck slamming her to the ground beside reed
she lays there beaten visible
in the distance behind doom city lights blink fading in and out
lights flutter softly here like when ben went through the machine
reed looks up
could it be
johnny jets over the water with the missile only twenty feet behind him
hes running out of options when he spots a garbage barge floating in the water ahead
thinking fast johnny does a fly by and hurls a fireball at the barge
the flames ignite and spread quickly
he loops back toward the flaming barge as the missile closes in on him
just as its about to hit johnny flames off and falls toward the water
as he tumbles through the air we cut back to from their vantage point they see the missile explode
sues eyes darken as doom grips her neck
reed tries desperately to move but he is frozen
it takes every last ounce of strength to lift one finger which makes a craccckkkking sound
one more down
now its just the scientist and his specimen
sue and reed lock eyes
reed tries to move his mouth
he has something to tell her struggling just to move his lips and get the words out
the only thing i ever knew without thinking was
his lips fully freezing i
he starts to say you but his lips freeze mid word
sue whispers to him me too reed
doom steps toward sue about to deliver the final blow
quiet cruel and so four became none
its my time now
an elevator door flies into the room
reed recognizes the voice
so do we
doom turns to see
ben grimm aka the thing
back in rocky fighting form
doom turns just as bam
ben hits doom harder than any living thing has ever been hit
the force sends doom back through the air toward the far wall where he smashes into the massive v sculpture
it snaps crashing onto him
a few sparks
nothing at all
no more movement
doom is dead
ben turns to reed
damn ive been wanting to do that
reed manages the thinnest smile as ben starts disconnecting the tubes from reed
reeds words victors not that bad huh
just a little larger than life
maybe youll listen to me next time before whmm
the wreckage shifts
they turn to see
he stands power coursing
and he charges at ben
ben charges back
and these two behemoths
doom and ben plummet wrestling in mid air
on the ground people scream and duck for cover
doom and ben smash through the large glass roof of a lower building across the street
doom and ben locked in combat drop through the glass landing in a large hotel pool
people scream run
underwater doom and ben land hard
their combined weight cracks the floor of the pool
a young boy watches underwater through his mask
doom and ben square off but
the cracks open wider
and theyre pulled toward the hole
the water is all sucked out of the hole
the boy holds tight to a ladder as ben and doom crash down to a hotel guest sees water flood into the hall
roaring rapids head straight for him
he jams his key into the lock turning desperately just barely leaping out of the way as the wave carrying ben and doom smashes through a window to smash
ben and doom fly out the window thrashing in the crash
water floods the street
doom and ben land in a large garbage truck
the truck rocks back and forth denting from the inside
the truck suddenly stops
cop cars speed closer sirens screaming
and boom a huge shape explodes from the truck
ben lands on a car filled with two old ladies his head cracks the windshield
doom steps out of the garbage truck water flooding the street around him
cop cars converge on doom
doom turns his attention to the cops
his limbs spark with electricity ready to fire at the cars
ben sees the cops and doom
he knows the cops are dead meat
he turns to the old lady in the drivers seat
excuse me maam
can i borrow your car
she nods and quickly gets out shaking
the clutch sticks a little
not gonna be a problem
ben lifts the car and throws it at doom
it flies through the air and wham
hits hard knocking doom back twenty feet
as doom flies back a bus enters frame and boom
doom smashes into the out of service bus
the bus slams into an electricity pole snapping the pole
doom steps out unharmed
ben charges toward him
doom grabs the broken electricity pole flips it into his hand and wields the pole like a giant stun gun
electric sparks fly through the air into ben
the blast of volts launches him off his feet
he goes flying backward electrocuted in mid flight and whoompf
ben lands hard face down cratering the street
water rushes into the crater
ben lays there incapacitated
on the street cars scream to stops people gasp
doom strides up to ben and raises the electricity pole for the death blow
right before he swings down i cant let you do that
doom turns to see
bruised and battered
slowly stepping toward him
and you cant stop me
he turns back to ben raises the pole but
he cant swing down
something is holding the pole in mid air
she turns visible holding back the pole with a forcefield
using her power she flings the pole from dooms grip
it skids along the street
reed helps ben to his feet
doom turns to these three wounded soldiers
what is this
the pitiful three
doom steps toward them but four
johnny swoops down hurling a fireball like a flamethrower knocking doom back
johnny takes his place alongside the others
the four of them stand as one
johnny turns to thing
had a little relapse huh
thing starts to retort but johnny gives a warm smile
they turn to doom who stands with metal skin slightly singed and melted making him look all the more menacing
this is going to be fun
electricity starts to course through his body
he stands at the foot of the crater ben made
he thrusts down grabbing a thick power cable ripping it out of the street
he snaps the cable into two snaking lashing strips
he holds tight absorbing the power
lights flicker and dim in buildings around him
doom glows amped up
he lets go of the cables
the two deadly wires snake out of control
pedestrians scatter panic
reed sees the wires slashing through the air
he makes a move reed streeetches his arms reaching for the deadly cables
doom fires superpowered energy bolts
the electric charges surge through the air toward the fantastic four but sue tosses her force fields exploding dooms blasts in mid flight
she keeps her hands up blocking blows like a prize fighter
one of dooms bolts glances off her force field and smashes into a concrete stanchion of a building
the pillar starts to crumble with people huddled under the overhang
theyre about to be crushed by the falling concrete
but suddenly the concrete roof holds steady
ben is holding it up
he stands beside the stanchion like atlas holding the world
people run out safe
on the street reed finally grabs both ends of the wire
johnny flies toward him and uses his flames to weld the wires back together
the cables start to fuse
doom keeps firing
sue struggles with her force fields
the impact is too much
her nose starts to bleed
reed sees her
she is about to drop her hands vulnerable but
reed stretches his whole body
he expands himself across the street and grabs a tree so he forms a wall between sue and doom
doom keeps firing his bolts
they slam into reeds body rubberband his skin and distend out his back without breaking
he strains agonizing
but all these people
johnny charges toward doom flames on his body starting build to a blinding white intensity engulfing everything
johnny grabs doom
quiet smiling flame on kid
johnny explodes in a pulse of bright white light which starts to heat up everything surrounding it
reed doesnt miss a beat
hes in total command now
sue i need some of that anger rage frustration looking at doom im sure i can come up with something
she sees johnny holding onto doom and the growing heat and light
sue shuts her eyes
a giant force field explodes from her body
a massive wave of energy
it swoops past a car which warps melts half the car is not inside the force field
thing turns to the crowd extending his arm blocking them
sues force field envelops johnnys supernova containing it in a bright sphere of energy
the light increases to the point that its blinding
people look away
finally johnnys supernova fades
he collapses to the ground exhausted smoking
sue exhales and falls to her knees
her force field fades
the light flickers out
as everyones eyes adjust we hear
and doom steps through the smoke
his metallic body glows white trailing molten metal
sue ben johnny look devastated
they cant beat him
he looks at reed
is that the best you can do
a little heat
reed stays perfectly calm
he shakes his head
time for your lesson vic
chem what happens when you supercool hot metal
to ben ben
got it teach
he kicks open the fire hydrant
the water geysers up
ben kicks down with his foot deflecting the water so it sprays toward reed who
twists his torso so
the water curls around his chest races down his arms and shoots right off his wrists toward doom
doom rushes toward reed but the water flies out dousing doom
giant clouds of steam fill the air from the cooling metal
his shrieks finally fade to silence
the water stops thick steam clouds roll completely obscuring doom from view
the steam clears to reveal doom
a true statue now a hard cold solid piece of metal
reed sue ben and johnny the fantastic four exhale
they stand as one in roiling smoke
damn i love this job
reed and sue slowly lock eyes thinking the same thing
will they accept their mantle
well we do have the suits
they give weary smiles
sue gets close to reed
you know about what we said up there i think maybe thhm
he kisses her
his neck extending
he pulls back slightly smiles at her
a new strength in him
funny how things turn out isnt it
sue looks at reed
a long way from that conference room
as they kiss people emerge stepping out of hiding
the sun rises around them
the fantastic four step into the new dawn of a new day
and we slowly dissolve to reed and sue kiss on the deck of the circle line as it chugs around new york city
dude thats still my sister
a party in progress
drinks food music
we see in the crowd a familiar faces ohoolihan cast on his arm bartender ernie others
johnny and ben stand behind reed and sue
reed and sue pull apart
reed turns to ben excited
ben ive been crunching the numbers on the machine
i think if we can rework the power settings
forget it egghead
im good as is
thats my benny
she hands ben a big metal mug
ben takes the mug
he clinks but shatters her glass
were going to have to work on your touch
i like the sound of that
alicia gets close
a soft smile
reed turns to sue
sue can i talk to you for a second
reed leads her out
ben and johnny swap a glance
a romantic view of the city scape
reed stands with sue
i found a broken gasket from space a gasket
reed were at a party
he opens his hand revealing a circular piece of metal just about the size of
sue slows down
if one of us were to wear it
she sees johnny and ben inside watching in on a secret
reed looks her square in the eye
what are you doing
reed drops to his knees
his head stays eye level while his body drops
sue gapes so emotional she starts to disappear
no more thinking no more variables
shes gone sue
reed goes to kiss her
thats my nose genius
these are my lips
reeds face is squeezed on both sides by sues invisible hands
she pulls him into a kiss and reappears
inside the party applauds
ben johnny and alicia move through the crowd to join reed and sue
as they go no more cracks about how i look
hey im mr
weaving around bodies clear the way wide load coming through
ben glares fists clenched
johnny smiles mischievous as they hit the balcony
and he flames on taking off into the air blazing the number four enclosed in a circle of flame their future callsign over the city skyline
the crowd oohs and aahs
ben watches unimpressed
people drink laugh dance
we slowly pull back from the party the boat the city and
cut to close on the melted face of doom
he is placed in a wooden crate
leonard oversees the operation listening to his cell
as two workers move the heavy door in place a crackle of electricity moves over dooms body
leonards cellphone goes staticky
his eyes narrow
could it be
the door closes
we can read the destination through stenciled lettering latveria
and we pull back to reveal the box is on the deck of a freighter ship
the ship pulls away steaming into the horizon as we
