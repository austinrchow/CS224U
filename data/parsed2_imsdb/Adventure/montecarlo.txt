alice perry s her innate and amiable authority eclipsed only by a self consciousness about her hair afraid perhaps that she hasnt lived up to the promise of its red
color chalks futur anterieur in precise cursive at the board
by tomorrow we will have flown to france
she turns to face her tenth grade french class
though alices make up earrings and practical flats are simple there is an inherent elegance to their combination that hints at a more complex if uncharted interior
who can give me an example
note throughout all blocks of italicized dialogue should be read as in french with english subtitles
i will have completed the assigned translation by the end of vacation
i will have failed french again by the end of the year
alice pauses regarding amber with a pained sympathy

emma lindgard late s rapidly scribbles a complex calculus formula at the board while all of her twelfth grade male students avidly admire her shape in a tight stylish skirt
she turns suddenly smiling brightly
kyle snaps his eyes up to emmas face tries to cover

david gazes back dumbly stuck in an erotic fog
two girls laugh conspiratorially dredging woven pot holders through an egg mixture and dropping them into a sputtering pan as the rest of the class makes french toast
the girls sneak looks at meg kelly s who tears recipes from a gourmet magazine at her desk at the front of the room
dark hair pulled into a pony tail face unadorned by makeup megs natural sexiness is muted by an air of indifference
she glances up when the pan erupts in flames and the girls leap back with a shriek shakes her head
the girls attempt to knock the pan from the burner with the handle of a broom when a pot lid bangs down instantly snuffing the flames
they shrink back as meg waves the lid clearing the smoke
do me a favor and lets just try to get to vacation
the class bell rings

you can burn the school down as soon as were back
alice a heavy bag slung over her shoulder and her boyfriend richard s scruffily handsome in sweats and a coachs jersey carrying three binders and a bag of baseball bats

together they cross a lawn dotted with patches of late snow to the parking lot stopping at alices weathered volvo where richard hands over the binders with a kiss

they kiss again and richard takes off for the athletic fields passing meg as she comes from the school waves

the zipper tears away from the suitcase witha loud rip
is meg pulls a well worn stuffed dog from her open suitcase on the couch holding it up to her daughter finn who wears a spangled tutu and cowboy boots
she wants to see paris too
finn if edith goes to paris with me she cant go to daddys with you
finns brows come together as she considers this then reaches for the dog
thats what i thought
seamus megs ten year old son pounds down the stairs carrying an enormous backpack as meg zips her bag closed
seamus makes a face drops his bag and heads back up the stairs as the doorbell rings
glenn s in a police uniform watches meg squeeze her children tightly

meg watches her kids run to the squad car parked at the curb just as karyn s also in uniform emerges on the passenger side to meet them
and no lights
meg lifts her chin in greeting but thats it

meg watches her kids climb in the car with karyn

leaning on the lip of the kitchens bar emma presses the record button on her answering machine then speaks with a put on coolly sophisticated jet setting accent
youve reached the home of emma lindgard
im afraid i wont be able to return your call right away as im currently traveling
but please do leave a message
she was known as the peoples princess
emma turns at the counter to see princes diana touring an african encampment with children on the television
she hangs up the phone and sits herself down at the coffee table where a game of solitaire is laid next to a microwaved lean cuisine dinner
she turns up the volume with the remote and gathers the cards shuffling
eyes glued to princess diana on television emma suddenly shoots her hands three feet wide rifling the cards in perfect vertical formation like a seasoned cardsharp
alice opens the door kissing richard who holds up a suitcase in one hand a bottle of champagne in the other
alice zips the suitcase shut and raises her arms in victory as richard pours the champagne into two glasses
i am good to go
monte carlo draft november
richard brings a glass to alice nuzzles her ear

alice takes her glass and presses richard down onto the bed climbing on top of him
like christmas when i was a kid
theres no way im going to be able to sleep tonight good for me
i mean how long have i been talking about this
you were reading colette
in the teachers lounge
first time we met
alice pauses as this lands somewhere deep inside
this is just the beginning
it feels like it
they clink glasses and richard watches alice tip her glass back then stop mid sip to peer down at the delicate diamond ring sitting at the bottom of her glass
richard takes her glass and fishes out the ring
lets try it on

i thought wed be seeing it together

he heads for the door
monte carlo draft november
richard come on
without looking back maybe ill see you in a week
alice listens to his footfalls and the slam of the front door then falls back on the bed striking her head on the open suitcase wincing
ladies and gentleman we are about to begin our descent into charles de gaulle international airport
meg sleeps in an aisle seat of the dim coach cabin where all the window shades have been drawn down emma dozing beside her a game of cards laid out
on her tray table
alice brings her seat to the upright position as instructed and sits hyper alert looking at her closed window shade
she reaches out and raises the shade a tentative crack flooding their row with light
she glances furtively around the cabin then inches the shade higher drawing in a sharp breath at what she sees
she flings the shade up
all of paris is laid out below her a magical nautilus like wheel with the eiffel tower as its central axle
her breath steams the window as she drinks it all in
she turns eyes full to meg who cranes across emma to share in the view and squeeze alices arm with a smile
are we there
monte carlo draft november
a customs agent stamps alices passport with a thump
alice looks up from her imprinted passport smiles hugely
alice emerges with meg and emma each struggling with their luggage onto the thronged arrivals deck
there it is
esprit de corps
alice looks to where emma points seeing a small sky blue flag at the end of a long staff held by madame valery s pinched their harried tour guide in
a suit of the same blue
excuse me are you madame valery
madame valery glances up from her clipboard beside their bus
hi my name is alice perry bags go under the bus
im traveling with my friends meg kelly and emma lindgard i speak english
well thats great

madame valery eyes alice unfolding a map from her binder
monte carlo draft november
now i was hoping you could tell me which route the bus will be taking youre not going to be a problem are you
the battered esprits de corps tours bus careens through the streets listing wildly from side to side
over buss p
on your right
alice squashed beside meg on the over crowded bus whips her head up from her guidebook
was the arc de triomphe
this is ridiculous
alice and meg turn to emma across the aisle who hooks a thumb at carl and deedee late s both stout beside her

but we finally made it
alice thats like you
back to couple were here celebrating my friend megs divorce
monte carlo draft november
the bus hurtles around the drive screeching to a halt bouncing roughly on its shocks at the museums entrance
alice meg and emma race past gallery after gallery trying to keep madame valerys little blue flag in sight as it flies over the crowd in the distance
alice whipsaws her head at everything theyre missing making notes in her guidebook on the fly
try to remember that
well double back for the chagalls
madame valery leads the charge up the right wing of the daru staircase past the statue of winged victory
alice stops meg and emma in front of the statue while carl and deedee try to catch their breath on the landing
also called nike of samothrace
greek goddess nike meaning victory

they head for the right stairs just as madam valery reappears descending with her group on the left
alice turns meg and emma around to come back down
well that saved us a climb
emma elbows her way out of a crush of raised cameras and cellphones to alice and meg who strain at the rear of the crowd to view a painting all
but the top of its gold frame obscured
monte carlo draft november
waving her camera i got it
i got it
meg and emma sit hunched over emmas camera and its shaky digital image of the mona lisa squeezed in with alice and the rest of their tour at too few
alice ill e mail it to you
meg looks up catching alice eyeing their surroundings
re mona lisa at least shes smiling
snaps to smiling what
im just a little tired
a happy idea hey
ill bet you have jet lag
well probably all get it
meg raises a glass of wine
to jet lag
emma and alice raise their glasses to toast as waiters plunk down identical plates of steak frites before them
they clink glasses and alice is suddenly jostled just as shes about to sip by carl as he turns from the table behind her spilling her wine
monte carlo draft november
i am so sorry
mopping her front he was just looking for the catsup if youre not using it
as emma passes the bottle of catsup meg offers alice her napkin and waiters sweep their plates away replacing them with creme brulees
pardon monsieur merci
he turns now catsup in hand to blink at the creme brulee that has replaced his own and deedees steaks
alice places a hand on madam valerys arm as she passes
pardon madame but
madam valery slowly raises her eyes from alices hand
im sorry but are you apologizing
theyve taken our dinners away madame valery taps her watch and then her clipboard
there were stragglers at the

esprit de corps tour members disembark from their bus in front of a comically narrow and vertical baroque hotel with its name in feeble buzzing neon le petit sommeil
look at this picture and tell me whats different
the women lower the travel brochure and its photograph of a tidy well appointed suite to regard the actual one in which they stand dingy impossibly small crowded by an
armoire that nearly meets the low sloping ceiling with two spindly twin beds and a military style cot
toujour le suck ez vous
i researched at least a million well
this is the one we could afford
a beat as they consider the room and their lot in life
its only five nights five nights
and alice you said yourself well hardly ever be in our room

at eagle river
itll be fun
emma opens what is essentially a closet with a toilet
heres your outhouse meg
alice joins emma at the bathroom door
monte carlo draft november
im going to try to hold it
lets just unpack she turns for the luggage nearly falling over at the weight of emmas suitcase as she reaches to lift it
alice help alice climbs onto one of the beds to help meg lift
emma what have you got in here
just the stuff you put on my list off her look and a couple options
the bag slips from megs grasp crashing onto the foot of the bed which collapses catapulting alice onto the cot which flips up over her knocking emma into the tiny
come on guys
alice gazes out a window that opens onto a narrow alley and the ugly backsides of buildings as meg and emma sleep fitfully behind her
she looks down at the cellphone in her hands scrolling through her speed dial to stop at
she hesitates with her thumb over the call button
she turns back to the miserable view considering for a beat then folds her phone away as she blinks back tears
madame valery leads a diminished flock bobbing her staff with its blue flag in a forced march across the span of the ornate pedestrian bridge toward the waiting tour bus
monte carlo draft november
the pont des arts has its name for the vast number of art students that come here to paint this famous city view
meg and emma the worse for wear trail madame valery at a distance with alice who now leads her own handful of tour members carl and deedee among them
its called the pont des arts because the louvre was formally known as the palais des arts
madame valery stops ahead turning back to take in alice and her cluster of appreciative followers
we must keep together
alices group circles an inscribed stone medallion with a star shaped brass inset on the pavement outside notre dame
dez roots dee france
its from right here that all the highway miles in all of france are measured
they also say that if you stand on this exact spot you are be destined to return to france in the future
oh im in
together they all step forward arms entwined laughing
i want a picture
of all of us
alice looks up as emma breaks away to see madam valery leading her dwindling group from the great church
madame valery sends her charges to the bus then heads straight for alice as emma tries to enlist a japanese couple to take a group photo with her camera
monte carlo draft november
my head count was short in the cathedral
i was explaining about madame valery sizes alice up and taps her staff as the group forms around them joined by the japanese couple
i do not carry it for my pleasure
we were just on our way inside well now you may head to the bus
but we havent been which is why you must follow my flag
but these people havent seen the there are many churches on the tour
but this is notre dame
they need to see this i assure you they will see everything they need to see well whats the point if its all a big fat blur
when nobody can see anything properly
let alone experience it or appreciate monte carlo draft november
you seem quite the paris expert for someone who has never been

the japanese wife frames the action with emmas camera
i might not have ever been here before but
ive waited my whole life for this trip
weve waited thirty years you tell her carl
you keep rushing us through like this is some kind of race and you wont even speak french with me
now i think ive been very nice
were from wisconsin
but im telling you i am not getting on that bus until my friends and i have seen notre dame
meg and emma exchange looks as alice plants herself with folded arms and steely resolve before madame valery
perhaps if madame is not satisfied with my tour she could conduct her own
whatd she say
alices eyes narrow in regarding madame valery and all fall silent a beat a crowd anticipating fireworks
the japanese wife snaps a picture of the standoff the sound of the shutter triggering alice to action
monte carlo draft november
with lightning speed she seizes madame valerys flag
madame valery nonplussed reaches out to reclaim her flag but alice jerks it further away while the japanese woman snaps picture after picture
carl were getting on the bus
madame valery lunges for the stick
the bus pulls away revealing the japanese couple who return emmas camera with a bow meg and alice holding the flag
that was fantastic
alice cheeks flushed watches carl waving goodbye from the buss rear window
alice you okay
alice brings the staff down across her knee snapping it in two casting the broken ends into the gutter as she raises herself to her full height
now the real tour can begin
lets kick this towns ass
alice marches forward as a few drops of rain fall
i think its starting to rain who cares
were in paris
whats a little rain
monte carlo draft november
water pours in sheets from the sky as alice meg and emma splash down the rue de rivoli and duck beneath the shelter of the hotels canopy
they shake water from their arms and hair pluck at their sopping clothes
they glance over at a few paparazzi sharing the protection of the overhang on the far side of the entrance as a camera flashes in taking emmas picture
emma smiles blinks confused as another photographer admonishes the first
youre wasting your film
thats not her
whatre they saying
alice looks about in equal confusion but stops short when she sees the opulent restaurant behind the windows glass
meg and emma turn to gape as well at the diners and elegant tables inside as the rain hammers down
that mes aims is paris
you think theyd let me use the bathroom
meg and emma step into the lobby a palatial world of marble gold and flowers as alice confers with the doorman
monte carlo draft november
joins emma and meg okay emma its down the hall to the left
meg and ill go and get us a table meet you in there
emma heads for the ladies room gaping at the lobby
get us a table
alice we cant afford to eat here my treat
you cant afford hooking megs arm were going to do one thing right in paris
i dont care how much it costs
they turn for the dining room passing the front desk where cordelia winthrop scott dressed similarly to emma though at ten times the cost unleashes her ire on the concierge
and just how do you propose i am to travel tomorrow then
i am sorry but there is nothing a manager enters from the back
mademoiselle scott i have checked and there is no sign of a package monte carlo draft november
id like to see someone who speaks english please
if there is such a person in france
the concierge and manager look to one another and back
this is not english we are speaking
emma swings through the door into the black marble bathroom grabbing a towel to swipe at her wet hair
she stops abruptly examines the towel
these are cloth
she takes the towel into one of the stalls closing the door behind her just as cordelia strides in stops at the counter
cordelias cellphone rings
and she pulls it from her purse
you would not believe these people
she takes her phone into the stall next to emmas and closes the door just as alice and meg enter
and they wonder why none of us do paris anymore
what ive been through
and daddy is being alice and meg look at one another in the mirror overhearing cordelia as they pick up towels to dry off
hes making me go to monte carlo
monte carlo draft november
i dont know
one of those foundations
but have i heard from them
and they were to take care of the plane
well im certainly not going to go if wait where are you
would i need a coat
a toilet flushes and cordelia opens her stall door heads for the counter oblivious to alice and meg who freeze with their towels blinking at her uncanny resemblance to emma
do you know if theres an evening flight
alice and meg turn to each other then to cordelias reflection in the glass their mouths hanging open
ooh i think i can just make it
i wont even check out here
its better if everyone thinks im being a good girl and taken the trip down to cordelia stops when her eyes snag on alice and meg
let me call you when i get to the airport
it may take awhile
she gives alice and meg a devastating look up and down
it appears to be raining outside
she picks up her purse and exits without looking back just as emma opens her stall door and joins alice and meg who gape at her with towels in their
did you see those are cloth
monte carlo draft november
no emma i mean exactly like you
well she sounded awful
and kind of mean
alice meg and emma punchy and a little drunk enjoy wine from enormous glasses as they finish their meals
draining her glass she should be ashamed
can you imagine having a room here and then not staying in it
an anxious waiter races in refilling alices glass
darling i was thinking of ordering this entire menu and then not eating it
the waiter retreats joining five others standing at discreet fearful attention all careful not to look at emma whom theyve clearly mistaken her for cordelia
we should just take it
and her trip to monte carlo
thats still france right
alice how fast can you get a binder going on a trip like that
oh id love to see that
us in monte carlo
whats so funny about that
we got in here
monte carlo draft november
it is pitiful how low the standards here have fallen
two waiters step in to clear plates hearing all
remind me to have daddy buy this hotel so that i can knock it down
alice and meg laugh with emma as the waiters head for the kitchen in panic
whispers to other she is a monster
emma you could be her
always making me laugh
who in their right mind would ever believe that i was pardon mademoiselle scott
the three look up at the manager in surprise
im so sorry
were we being too loud
no no we are all very happy to see mademoiselle scott smile
a wine steward hustles up to the table with an ice bucket stand and a bottle of champagne
in apology for our earlier misunderstanding
monte carlo draft november
your dinners as well
with our compliments
the three women exchange glances as the steward begins to open the bottle and the manager bows backing away
excuse me monsieur
emma smiles broadly batting her eyelashes as the steward pops the champagne cork
i so hate to be a bother but i seem to have misplaced my room key
the door swings open into the dark room framing the three drunk laughing women
alice fumbles for a switch hitting the lights and their laughter cuts abruptly at the sumptuous interior of gleaming marble gilt and silk
alice sees but one the thing the eiffel tower illuminated on the other side of a bank of french doors
theres a view
alice races to push back the window sheers revealing a staggering panorama of the city the seine and the eiffel tower in the pouring rain
the entire city of light is reflected in her eyes
now this is more like it
monte carlo draft november
theres whole other room in here
alice enters steering around a tower of louis vuitton luggage as meg pulls a fresh bottle of champagne from a bucket of ice
what are you guys doing
emma launches herself onto the enormous bed
this is the room we were supposed to have
on what planet
we were only going to take a look
so were looking
pops the champagne and we like what we see
meg takes the bottle and crawls up with emma
alice take a break would you
we two kilometers
a lot happened today
pats the bed alice how many do chances do we get
for something like this
alice considers looks out the window at the streaming rain
but just until it stops raining
then we go
monte carlo draft november
makes room for alice agreed
alice climbs up and together the three pass the bottle of champagne as they study the ceilings ornate plasterwork
im sorry i just keeping thinking of the look on that womans face
im glad i got pictures
i did surprise her surprised me
really loved that flag didnt she
poor carl and deedee
do you think that if you sleep in a bed like this every night your dreams are different
alice rolls to her side and the view of the eiffel tower
like are they bigger
do you dream a more amazing life
meg kicks off her shoes lets them drop
well never know
seen from the bed the light atop the eiffel tower breaks through the dissipating clouds to swing a searching arc through the night sky
the eiffel tower gleams gold and orange in the morning sun
monte carlo draft november
a telephone rings stirring alice
it rings again
she reaches for it in her sleep as emma sits up groggily beside meg curled around the empty champagne bottle
what time is it
alices eyes fly open as she snaps awake
meg wake up
were in trouble meg pulls herself up sees alice on the phone
oh shiii well be right down
she hangs up
we were only joking
we didnt mean to
well tell them it was a mistake
cordelia your car is here
alice meg and emma attempt to conceal themselves behind cordelias tower of cases as its wheeled from the elevator by two porters
monte carlo draft november
the women scurry for the exit past the desk manager
just keep moving
the three women increase their pace but the manager catches up to them with an express envelope
mademoiselle scott this came for you this morning
the package you were seeking
emma merely blinks at the offered envelope
just take it
they break for the door but the manager follows
im afraid there may still be some what
as they emerge the manager and doormen hustle alice emma and meg towards a waiting car and driver as paparazzi call and shoot from across the boulevard
thank you so much but i think well but you can not walk to the airport
monte carlo draft november
a beat as emma and meg look to alice for direction and the frenzied calls of the paparazzi increase
well just have him drop us off
alice and meg look out the back window at the manager who waves them farewell the doorman shooing photographers
they really do think shes her
alice and meg spin to emma as she spills the envelope s contents
i want to know where were going

emma for crying out loud
meg you want to help me out here
meg wants to go

monte carlo draft november

meg looks up from the itinerary shrugs
trips paid for whether that girl takes it or not
and somehow that magically makes taking it right
whats the worst that could happen
i can think of a lot of things youre in charge
you want to go back to that hotel okay by me
a beat while alice looks between meg and emma trapped
totally your call
and darling well completely understand if you feel we shouldnt go
the car drives across the wide stretch of runway on a trajectory for a waiting private jet
the women swivel around in their plush seats at the pop
of a cork as a steward opens a bottle of champagne
we take a look around
we get on a train and come right back
monte carlo draft november
anything goes wrong we say it was a language thing that we didnt now i like that idea because its true
they fall silent as the steward appears with glasses of champagne wait for him to retreat
go look come right back
its a good plan
alice meg and emma clink glasses
the steward helps the women from the plane where another uniformed man waits on the tarmac to escort them further
their escort opens a door ahead of them to a roof deck wind spilling in to the stairway they climb
they emerge onto the deck emma squealing and grabbing alice when she sees their waiting helicopter
alice meg and emma delight as the helicopter banks along the coast the mediterranean glittering in blue and green below
a craggy ridge falls away and all of monte carlo unfolds in step upon step of coral rooftops cream and gold
alice emma and meg step from a limousine blinking in the bright sunlight to take in the square in front of the hotel its fountain and the adjacent casino
monte carlo draft november
what do we want to do first
check out the palace or the beach
lets find a map mademoiselle scott
they turn as jean pierre michand late s sophisticated in jeans and a sportscoat but with a warm bohemian air comes down the steps an oversized envelope tucked under his
well bon jour me

with the foundation he pauses in shaking emmas hand as his eyes land on alice with friendly curiosity a charge
i didnt realize you would be bringing oh im sorry
this is alice perry and meg kelly
two of my dearest friends
visiting from america
jean pierre has trouble pulling his eyes from alice as he shakes megs hand
it is a pleasure to meet friends monte carlo draft november
emma sneakily indicates jean pierres empty ring finger to alice and meg as he consults his wristwatch
im terribly sorry but i am already late for a meeting we wont keep you i just wanted to make sure you arrived safely and that i was here to
and of course to deliver your invitations for the week and the foundations report invitations for the week
leading up to the again i am so sorry but i am reluctant to keep his highness waiting
but we will see each other at the casino for tonights game

alarmed by this news
monte carlo draft november
were very sorry perhaps we have misunderstood each other
she must be there for tonights game
his highness has asked to be seated across from her whats he saying
jean pierre looks imploringly between the three
it is for the foundation
within a glossy brochure a collage of snapshots shows happy african children grouped outside their new school raising their hands at their desks in a pristine classroom finding their country
on a glossy globe
oh would you look at these kids
no i cant
i cant stand it
emma reads to alice and meg from the brochure in the seating area of their luxurious suite enjoying none of it nor the incredible balcony view of monte carlos marina
with your help the michand foundation is able to sow the seeds of education transforming lives families and villages one child at a time
she didnt say anything about a school
schools with an s
more than one
monte carlo draft november in africa
that horrible irresponsible girl
ive never stolen a thing in my life now ive taken a trip from school children
meg hangs her head

theyre counting on her for a charity auction and she doesnt even show up

emma reaches for a gigantic wrapped fruit basket
do not touch that
if youre cordelia
theyve seen you
well i cant go to that thing tonight

the phone rings
and emma snatches it up before alice can
alice gestures for emma not to say anything to hang up
monte carlo draft november
oh yes please

yes all of it
thank you ever so
she hangs up and holds a beat before turning to alice
my luggage is here
alice and meg stand in front of the tower of louis vuitton trunks and cases while emma idly thumbs the combination lock of a steel briefcase in her lap
but just for tonight
and thats it
alice and meg look to emma holding the now open briefcase eyes wide
a necklace of diamonds and enormous yellow stones sparkles like a constellation from within the cases velvet lining
all goes back
the gaming halls towering ornate doors are opened by two doormen for alice emma and meg to make their big entrance in cordelias couture chiffon silk and organza
heads held high backs straight they strike a remarkable tableaux as they pause in unison at the top of the rooms raised landing to survey the swirl of roulette wheels
and the tony european jet set
monte carlo draft november
at first glance they look spectacular but under closer scrutiny one can read megs composed discomfort in wearing a dress that is too tight nearly spilling her breasts and the
self consciousness alice endures in a dress made daringly short by her height
but this is because we know them to all other eyes they not only belong here they own the room
they glance at one another eyebrows up were here
dont you feel like weve won something already
jean pierre comes to greet them with prince domenico da silvano s movie star handsome both in tuxedos offering a hand to escort emma down the few steps

a dealer unseals a new deck of cards as domenico pulls out a chair for emma at the rooms enormous game table

alice moves to sit but then remembers her skirt looks to meg who is unable to even raise a leg in her tight dress
easier to see if we stand
jean pierre hands them both a glass of champagne

domenico casts a glossy chip into the pot
mademoiselle scott starts us at ten thousand a hand
alice and meg freeze their champagne glasses sliding from their hands while emmas eyes grow as large as all the zeroes on domenicos chip

emma sits locked in a cool stare down over the top of her cards with domenico across from her at the tensed table
meg downs a glass of champagne in one gulp snagging the back of the waiters jacket hauling him back for a refill
the waiter turns to alice who pats at her face with a damp napkin struggling to breathe

emma places her cards face down before her appears to fold
she moves her hands to the stacks and stacks of chips beside her and pushes them to the center of the table

alice slips around the railing and heads for emma as two players fold in near tears leaving just emma domenico and a dowager s in the game

domenico pushes his own mountain of chips to the pot in the center of the table and alice buries her face in her hands when the dowager folds her cards

alice moves back to her stool tries to smile as she takes the water jean pierre offers

she turns her cards over and fans them on the table felt a royal flush in the suit of hearts ace high
i do hope there are no hard feelings
the other players cheer as domenicos smile crashes
emma shrieks with delight turning to alice and meg who grab each other barely keeping themselves from pitching over glasses spilling as the other players applaud
emma rakes in the everest of multi colored chips with both arms laughing as shes congratulated

domenico and jean pierre each toting buckets of chips escort alice emma and meg to the elevator all giddy

the elevator arrives and the doors open as domenico leans in towards emma

emma evades domenico by stepping onto the elevator
oh delmonico domenico

meg collects the buckets from domenico and steps on

he watches as she surveys the rich array of fresh produce lifting a tomato to her nose inhaling with a private smile
meg bites into the tomato spurting juice onto her cheek and down her front
she looks up as she attempts to wipe the juice away stopping when she catches bernard smiling with amusement
meg rolls her eyes with self deprecation and moves on along the line of stalls
bernard pays for his purchase and follows finding meg at another stall where a frenchwoman tries to communicate how to prepare the fish they both admire

she picks up her book and crosses back to the door
richard steps from the hotel with a manager s who pantomimes that he recognizes alice from the snapshot richard shows him but has no idea where she could be
richard pulls out a map to point at a random spot and the manager gestures up the street down the street shrugging she could be anywhere
alice amid a crowd of tourists only half watches the changing of the guards outside the palace gates
she snaps herself out of her distraction with a shake of her head and turns to the marked pages in her guide book
she glances up to find carl and deedee from the tour

alice is surprisingly overcome and impulsively throws her arms around both of them
well were sure surprised to see you too

sometimes youve just gotta follow your heart
be bold let the rest take care of itself
richard stands with his map beneath the arch where all roads come together in a spinning roundabout of bleating car horns

the car pulls away carl and deedee turning in their seats to wave at alice through the rear window
alice waves until they are out of sight and slowly lowers her hand standing alone in the street
alice sighs and pulls out her guide book unfolding a map as she looks up to gather her bearings
she takes in the quiet street the view of the ocean then looks back at the map in her hands
she straightens up a new look of purpose on her face and crosses the street to toss her guide book and map in the trash can on the corner striking
out unaided down a narrow twisting street hung with vines and flowers
alice rounds the corner of one street into the tight intersection of two narrow alleys in the fading twilight
she looks around
cheeks flushed hair pasted to her forehead lost in a maze of dilapidated walled courtyards and apartment blocks home to the citys service workers
she hesitates then forges ahead down one street until she sees that it dead ends and she doubles back
alice suppresses panic as she walks briskly up a steep alley high in the hills trailed now by a small stray dog
she stops turns to the dog that also stops then sits

alice holds her kabob stick out for the dog to eat surrendering her dinner with pleasure

meg hangs on to bernard as they zip along the beachfront drive and turns her face to the wind with a smile
she surrenders to the ride the sheer fun of it laughing
how do you say faster
bernard and meg flush from their ride enter the kitchen through a back door to be hailed by a half dozen chefs crowded around a table littered with dishes
monte carlo draft november
the best chefs of monte carlo
they come here to drink and show off
the end of every night
henri s a bear in chefs whites lumbers towards them
we are only cooks allowed here
ah but this is why weve come
i have finally found someone who can teach you how to cook
this is meg from america
and this is henri the worst egotist my mentor
the two men embrace merrily kissing each other on both cheeks then henri pulls meg under his arm
turns to the table a chef from america
come to flip hamburgers
jean pierre drives an open silver sports car full of party goers down the twisting streets when he sees the commotion and crowd around the dirt lot
then he spots alice running around
alice sticks like glue to a kid with the ball maneuvers in steals the ball and doubles back in the opposite direction racing up the field as the crowd laughs
she passes the ball to kid who drives it to the goal scores
alice looks up from the game at the tapping of a car horn to see jean pierre honking in celebration as he leans against the car with his guests enjoying
alice stops to wave and takes the ball full in the face
monte carlo draft november
jean pierres smile winks out as alice drops and he races from the car as worried kids and spectators form a circle around alices prone body
the little dog licks alices face and she opens her eyes
she leaps up as jean pierre crosses the lot
she sets off down the field with the kids
empty and half filled glasses bottles litter every surface along with plates ashtrays crumpled napkins
emma sits on the lower landing deck legs in the water shoes in her hand looking out at the lights
nikolai moves his legs in the gentle current beside her tuxedo trousers rolled while he concentrates on working a napkin into intricate folds
emma turns to look back at the silent boat
it doesnt seem fair
leaving you to clean up all alone
but youve really got to talk to your boss
nikolai laughs shaking his head
it must get kind of lonely sometimes
not being understood
i know how that can feel
nikolai holds up the napkin hes transformed into a crown adorned with flowers and the wire cages from champagne corks
emma looks at him her face soft and vulnerable open as nikolai places the makeshift crown on her head with care
monte carlo draft november
they look at one another for a beat then simultaneously turn to the sea and the frail sky awaiting the sun
you get me
nikolai looks down at his hand on the edge of the deck next to emmas and turns it palm up in invitation
emma places her hand in his
you get me
meg tries to follow the discussions and familiar teasing of the chefs as they pass plates goading her to taste
she looks over at bernard who smiles as he holds his hands up at the scene his boisterous friends the food as though to say this is good enjoy
meg relaxes her shoulders and gives in to the spirit of the table spears a bite of food and lifts her glass to bernard
meg and another chef locked in a chopping duel plow though onions at a blinding pace their knives flashing creating an escalating staccato on their cutting boards
meg sweeps her onion from her board to a pan and slams her knife down in victory as all the chefs erupt with applause
henri seizes megs hand raising her arm in the air and presents her with a bottle of wine
meg turns to bernard beaming thrilled utterly happy as the other chefs clap her on the back shake her hand
jean pierre opens the door at the top of the fire stairs revealing the open sky turning back to take alices hand
monte carlo draft november
whats the most amazing place youve ever been
hard to say
there are many
alice steps out onto the hotels roof with jean pierres jacket over her shoulders
well africa then
how often do you get to go
he leads her around the maze of skylights to the front of the building that faces the sea and the lightening sky
mostly i am on planes
to the places where sunlight and parties make people generous
alices smile flickers with a vague disappointment as she leans against the hotels crown beside jean pierre
that seems a shame
but i can think of one place i have never been
it is in my imagination only so it is very special
he places an arm around alice as they take in the view
it is just a small town in a vast open space
maybe in the middle of america
there are people there like yourself who are kind
and children who have everything they need
alice turns to jean pierre as he takes a strand of her hair in his fingers and they hold a beat looking at one another
in my mind it is bordered by fields that are green
monte carlo draft november
alice breaks the moment by turning her head to search the far horizon just as the rising sun crests the open sea
nikolai shrugs himself out of his formal shirt to stand before emma in nothing but starfish printed boxer shorts
he lifts his hands this is me
here i am
emma hesitates then lets her gown fall around her bare except for her panties the necklace and her napkin crown
nikolai pushes himself off the side of the boat at a run hiking up his legs into a cannonball
he surfaces and turns back to the boat just as emma dives in with a splash
she swims to nikolai pushing him under in a childs game and he pops up spitting water like a fountain
they laughs and emma loops her arms around him
a beat as they sober
emma pulls nikolai close to her and they kiss
on the landing deck emmas gown shimmers in the morning sun with nikolais crown and cordelias yellow gem and diamond necklace nestled among its satin folds
alice still wearing jean pierres jacket walks down the hall with jean pierre close beside her neither speaking
she turns to him when they reach the door of her suite
a long beat stretches full of every possibility
come with me
i leave the day after
what is today
i leave tomorrow
you could come too
you wouldnt need to bring anything
monte carlo draft november
a near confession you dont know me
this is why i ask
i would like to know you alice
alice regards him a beat then slowly pulls his jacket from her shoulders
before this id never even been to france
jean pierre blinks and alice laughs as much at herself
just kept putting it off
always managed to find an excuse
but really it was that i was afraid
that it couldnt ever live up to the france id imagined
and if it did
then id never be able to go home
alice gently places jean pierres jacket in his hands and steps near to kiss him on the lips
but thank you
she turns and opens the door with her key as jean pierre smiles ruefully
alice steps into her room and closes the door
richard exits the plane walking down a mobile stairway onto the tarmac carrying alices repaired suitcase
monte carlo draft november
richard stands at the information counter conferring with an attendant in his broken french
im looking for the train
to monte carlo
behind him cordelia strides through a set of doors to stop directly at richards back as she searches the terminal and hisses into her cellphone
yes daddy im here
no i do not see a driver
yes i am looking
the attendant points over richards shoulder to an exit
richard begins to turn in cordelias direction but the attendant corrects him pointing the other way
he picks up alices suitcase and heads off just as a uniformed driver approaches cordelia
where have you been
the driver leads her away neither she nor richard having taken note of the nearby newsstand and its display of todays front page emma on the yacht wearing cordelias necklace
meg zooms the moped around the fountain a last loop bernard on the back before jerking to a stop in front of the hotel
bernard steadies the moped as meg climbs off
well this is me
back to the old grimaldi suite
i have to open the restaurant
monte carlo draft november
a beat as they face each other neither knowing how to end the evening how to say goodbye
thank your father for me
i will meg
meg hugs him briefly awkwardly then turns for the steps
meg stops holds a beat with her back to bernard
then she turns and marches to him with purpose seizing his face in both her hands and kisses him passionately
she releases bernard who staggers against the moped catching himself just before going over as she turns again for the steps an enormous smile on her face
alice sits on the edge of the bed with the hotel phone idly looking out at the sparkling bay and anchored boats
leaving a message well i wish you were there
i wish you were here richard
because i keep thinking no matter what i see im only seeing half of it
because were not seeing it together
meg lets herself in the front door and heads for the bedroom stopping when she overhears alice on the phone

because thats all i want
alice hangs up the phone so lost in thought she doesnt see meg standing at the door
monte carlo draft november
alice looks up smiles to see her friend

suddenly all i could think about was the trip
monte carlo draft november
that i hadnt already been to france
it was like this wave all the years and chances id had but didnt take they just crashed down on me and i hadnt seen anything but the end of

you were going
we were on our way
i thought he was asking me to make a choice
but he wasnt
he wasnt doing that at all
it was me
because i couldnt believe he loved me just for who i was
france or no
all i had to do was say yes
honey richard knows you
it might feel like its over

i really ruined it this time
the suites doorbell rings and they both look up
alice opens the door for emma who stands up from retrieving the morning paper just outside the door

on a cloud but what does it matter really
when i already have everything ill ever need
alice exchanges a look with meg as emma swans across the suite to tear open on the fruit basket pluck out an apple and drape herself across a chaise
monte carlo draft november

alice holds up the newspaper

emmas face clouds as she distractedly reaches a hand to her bare collar bone then flicks her eyes up to alice
emma wheres the necklace
monte carlo draft november
emma leaps up and races to the window throwing the doors wide as alice and meg dash after her onto the balcony
i left it on
are you kidding me
they look directly down to the base of the hotel where the trio of paparazzi call as cordelia emerges from a limousine
alice and meg look at each other stricken
whats she doing here
cordelia strides across the lobby passing workers who set up for the auction and arrives at the front desk
a busy desk clerk glances up brightening happily
cordelia looks at him with typical withering disdain
the driver was late
the clerks smile falters fades
im checking in
alice emma and meg race around frantically grabbing clothes stuffing them into shopping bags
the elevator doors open and cordelia steps off with a bellhop toting her bags as her cell phone rings
monte carlo draft november
the three women scramble though the suite collecting straightening smoothing in a blind panic
the bellhop stops outside the door with cordelia
oh i want to come
will you wait for me
alice meg and emma freeze in their tracks at the very center of the suite their heads swinging toward the door when they hear the key inserted from the other
the bellhop opens the door holding it wide for cordelia who marches in to the room
where everything impossibly appears to be in place
i can be there in say a day i was meant to have a suite
of course theyve screwed this up as well
who else is going
the bellhop opens the bedroom doors revealing the tower of cordelias luggage crowned by the reassembled fruit basket
cordelia unimpressed indicates the bags the bellhop holds
put those with the others wait wait
she spins away for the french doors twisting their handles and throwing them wide
monte carlo draft november
cordelia steps to the railing completely unaware of alice precariously perched atop the adjacent balconys railing back pressed against the face of the hotel
stavros is supposed to be here isnt he
i dont see his boat
alice carefully turns to meg and emma who look back her with desperate faces from the balcony on the far side of cordelia where they balance with their shopping bags
she does a quick turn marches inside
the bellboy stands expectantly by the front door
he nods not quite with his hand out but waiting
if youre done you may go
the bellboy turns but hesitates in catching a quick glimpse of alice fleet as a gazelle as she passes the open doors on the balcony behind cordelia
i said you can go
he bows a retreat backing out the door
alice climbs across to the next balcony where meg tries the handles of another set of french doors
monte carlo draft november
they each look about for a route of escape
emma looks down on the heads of the unsuspecting paparazzi while alice scrutinizes the facade above
alice looks at meg
alice laces her fingers together turning to emma
theres a door on the roof
shopping bags swing up over the edge of the roof landing in profusion followed by three sets of gripping hands
alice meg and emma haul each other over the hotels crown the view of the ocean and the yachts in the bay behind them
a boat driver in uniform passes a captains hat to nikolai who places it on his head as they speed towards the marina
meg turns to get a gauge on the distant yacht as she and alice labor with the oars of a fishermans dinghy
whyd they have to park so far out anyway
one point five million euros emma
monte carlo draft november
i said i was sorry

well sit down then
nikolais wake hits the dinghy rocking them hard
richard steps off the train with todays paper wedged under the arm that carries alices suitcase
the dinghy strikes the side of the yacht and the three women scramble to their feet grasping the side of the boat
monte carlo draft november
it was right here

meg doubles over hands on her knees as emma stands over the empty spot on the landing
are you even sure you took it off

just because i emma were not talking about a pair of sunglasses

monte carlo draft november
nikolai picks up the hotel phone as he removes emmas room key from his pocket
thats what im talking about
its just so unfair the way daddy assumes ive nothing better to do than the hotel phone rings interrupting her complaint
she picks up the ringing telephone at the desk
what is it
i cannot understand you
she hangs up heads for the fruit basket with her cell
mummy mummy im just saying i wish someone anyone would consider my feelings
she snatches up an apple from the basket without looking
you go ask him how much he thinks a simple thank you might cost
she hangs up her cell with a sniff and raises the apple stopping when she sees where emma has eaten
she recoils dropping the apple which rolls across the carpet and hits one of emmas sandals beneath the desk
cordelia approaches looking down to discover the other sandal in the wastebasket along with emmas broken plastic tiara room service dishes and the newspaper
monte carlo draft november
cordelia pulls the newspaper from the trash curiosity turning to shock as she takes in the huge torn photograph of emma wearing her necklace
the women paddle back towards the marina
well were just going to have to talk to her
oh yeah that was the first thing that struck me about her
how reasonable she seemed seizing on the idea yeah well just explain
we should have sailed that yacht right back to wisconsin it was an accident

cordelia slams the steel briefcase onto the bad scrabbling at the combination lock
she rips the lid open to reveal the empty velvet lining and she screams

richard pays a taxi driver taking alices repaired suitcase and mounts the steps directly behind domenico escorting penelope through the revolving door
domenico and penelope head for the ballroom entrance and richard arrives at the front desk just as the clerks phone begins to ring

lechu k tebe na krylyah lyubvi
they look at each other in confusion nikolais smile fading cordelia with mounting alarm
she slams the door in his face
at the end of the hall the elevator doors open for alice emma and meg as nikolai removes the necklace from his pocket and reaches to ring the suites bell
dont touch that bell
they race down the hall towards nikolai who gapes perplexed by the sight of emma

the doors close and emma sprints back down the hall to alice and meg at the door
alice rings the bell
cordelia approaches the door cautiously and spies through the peep hole at the back of megs head
who is it
voice dropped low security madame
she opens the door
a beat where cordelia focuses on alice and meg first possibly remembering them then she registers emma
she blinks completely nonplussed
we can explain
monte carlo draft november
the elevator doors open and nikolai steps off just as the revolving door begins to spin spitting uniformed police officers and their captain into the lobby
the clerk looks up and hustles around the desk to meet them
is there a problem
we received a report of an attempted murder in the grimaldi suite
cordelia scott richard sitting nearby looks up at the mention of cordelias name at the same time that nikolai takes a seat at the far end of the same sofa
it is robbery
but mademoiselle scott said it wasnt
jean pierre checking lists at the ballrooms entrance notes the commotion and cordelias name joins the group
mademoiselle scott has been robbed
she said not
she said someone was trying to kill her

richard seems to debate getting involved as the police the clerk and jean pierre head for the elevators

cordelia slaps emma across the face
alice and meg gasp and they all stand a beat in shock

emma raises a hand to cup her cheek as alice and meg turn slowly to cordelia their faces set like warrior masks
the elevator doors open and the police spill out followed by the clerk and jean pierre
they hear a scream
and break into a run
alice shoves cordelia roughly into a chair thrusting her back down as she tries to struggle up points at emma
you apologize to her right now

cordelia scoffs and alice leans over her menacing
because no matter where you go no matter where you jet to in this world you are still going to be you

the all freeze when a banging erupts at the door

alice claps a hand over cordelias mouth looks to meg

meg and bernard both turn their heads to look down the corridor when cordelia sticks her head out the bedroom door into the hall
a beat as cordelia and meg lock eyes
the elevator doors open at the end of the hall closer to cordelia
she looks back at meg for an instant then bolts as meg leaps past bernard into the hall
emma models cordelias necklace on a stage for over a hundred guests with domenico fielding bids beside her

emma nods without any real understanding as he indicates the necklace

emmas eyes slowly come into focus as it all becomes clear and she faints
together alice meg and emma offer an envelope fat with euros to jean pierre
they stand with richard bernard nikolai penelope and domenico beside a waiting sedan at the base of the hotels steps where the trio of paparazzi shoot away

emma and nikolai shake hands with bernard then turn and head for the marina trailed by one of the paparazzi while the other two pause to reload their cameras
as bernard hops on his moped to zip away the revolving doors turn and cordelia steps out talking on her cellphone followed by a train of bellhops and luggage
it was a huge success she stops suddenly as if struck and her expression of perpetual anger melts away as she listens blinks

one of the paparazzi raises his camera to take her picture but another places his hand over the lens
thats not her
thats the other one
alice sits between richard and meg at the departure gate each lost in their own thoughts as travelers pass to and fro
a long beat
a small smile finds its way onto alices face and she gently lowers her head to rest it on richards shoulder
richard finds alices hand and squeezes it in his own
meg walks down the jetway in her skinny jeans a bounce in her step shopping bags in one hand the bottle of wine gripped in the other as though headed
for a party
behind her alice carries her shopping bags and richard totes alices suitcase
i used to wander aimlessly wanton my goal grievous my plight
your dear hands led me guided me
alice encircles richards waist as they walk and he slings an arm around her shoulder kisses her hair
under a beating sun emma dressed in immaculate white linen holds hands with nikolai as a mob of laughing children and their teachers greet them outside a new marchand foundation

over the far horizon night glowed with the pallid hope of dawn
your eyes glance was my morning light
a young girl presents a length of brightly woven fabric draping it over emmas shoulders as emma picks the girl up and the other children lead emma and nikolai inside
a bulletin board in megs classroom is covered in african fabric photographs and letters all under a banner that reads food drive for our sister school zambia
the two students who had cooked their pot holders sort canned goods beneath the board while meg cooks surrounded by the rest of her class
no sound save his own tread upon the ground to ease the wanderers heart
your voice encouraged me go on
a student carefully scoops spices with a measuring spoon holding it out for meg to add to her pan
she ignores the spoon instead reaching to pinch some spice with her fingers and encourages the student who follows her example
alice moves freely around the center of the circle of desks her students have formed reciting by memory
yes my heart dark cowed set apart alone bewailed its dire distress
sweet love with its all conquering art
the entire classroom hangs on her every word
joined us as one in joyousness
a beat as she and her class float on the last phrase of paul verlaines poem
monte carlo draft november
mademoiselle perry what was it really like
alice refocuses to smile at amber and survey all the faces of her students for a beat
everyone should go
at least once in their life
theres a whole world for you to see
