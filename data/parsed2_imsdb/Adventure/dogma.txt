jersey spring day
beyond the wooden planks that make up the aged fun pier the ocean waves crash into the sandy shoreline
an old man stares at the empty beach
sun worshipers hours away from besmirching the dunes
his features are simple
he wears an old overcoat
his face belies good years gone by a face that has seen more sunrises than one would suspect
he inhales the crisp salty air and lets a small satisfied smile cross his face
a large arcade with steel shuttered doors sits on the boardwalk
three young boys skate around by on roller blades passing a street hockey ball between them proficiently
the old man views them briefly
checks his watch and looks back toward the ocean
the skates of the three hockey playing youths skid to a halt
we pan up to their faces now cold and dispassionate
they look at one another and nod
their skates glide out of frame
skaters the old man leans on the railing that overlooks the beach
we get closer and closer to him until
one of the skaters checks him hard into the railing
the old man exhales violently and falls to his knees
the two other skaters begin savagely beating on him with their hockey sticks as he crumbles beneath them
repeatedly their blades crash down hard on his head
i dont understand how can you base your lack of belief in god on the writings lewis caroll
the three skaters cease their beating and check the old mans pulse
satisfied they skate away leaving his crumpled form on the boardwalk
loki walks beside a nun in a semi busy terminal
they pass through the metal detectors
the nun carries a donation can
leaving alice in wonderland aside look closely at through the looking glass particularly the walrus and the carpenter poem whats the metaphorical meaning
i wasnt aware there was one
oh but there is it colorfully details the sham that is organized religion
the walrus with his girth and good nature obviously refers to either the buddha or with his tusks the lovable hindu elephant god lord ganesha
this takes care of the eastern religions
the carpenter is an obvious reference to jesus christ who was purportedly raised the son of a carpenter
he represents the western religions
and in the poem
what do they do
they dupe all the oysters into followmg them
when the oysters collective guard is down
the walrus and the carpenter shuck and devour the helpless creatures en masse
i dont know what that says to you but to me it says that following faiths based on these mythological figures insures the destruction of ones inner being
bartleby sits amongst a row of seats by one of the arrival gates
he eats popcorn and stares at
a steady stream of travelers exiting the gate meeting lovedones family
organized religion destroys who we are or who we can be by inhibiting our actions and decisions out of fear of an intangible parent figure who shakes a finger at
us from thousands of years ago and says no no
bartleby smiles at the meet and greets warmed
loki saddles up beside him kneeling on one of the seats facing the nun
through the looking glass a childrens tale
i think not
really dazed ive
ive never really thought about it like that
beat shocked off her cassock what have i been doing with my life
dont look back
just get out there and taste life
off donation can leave this for the unenlightened
poverty is for the gullible its another way the church is trying to control you
you take that money youve been collecting for your parish reconstruction and go get yourself a nice piece of ass
you deserve it
the nun nods at him and saunters off obviously grappling with something
a passerby tries to stick money in her can but she yanks it away
loki faces the proper direction in his seat and plops down beside the still transfixed bartleby
looking oc heres what i dont get about you you know for a fact that there is a god
youve been in his presence hes talked to you personally
and yet i just heard you claim to be an atheist
cmon man you know i dont believe any of that shit i was telling her
i just like to fuck with the clergy keep em on their toes
when her head stops spinning shell be facing the way of the just again
will she have a bunch to confess
looks around now heres what i dont get about you why do you feel the need to come here all the time
off travelers i like to watch
this is humanity at its best
look at them
a reunited family share a group hug and move on making way for two young lovers to embrace and kiss passionately
all that tension all that anger and mistrust forgotten for one perfect moment when they come off that plane
see those two
the guy doesnt even know that the girl cheated on him while he was away
bartleby and loki continue to watch the arrivals
but it doesnt matter at this moment because theyre both so relieved to be with one another
i like that
i just wish they could all feel that way more offen
maybe if someone gave them free bags of peanuts more often they would
now what was so friggin important that i had to miss cartoons this morning
if it was to share in your half assed obsessions with hallmark moments im going to slug you
still looking oc youre never going to believe this were going home
off bartlebys popcorn let me have some
pulls out envelope look what somebody sent us in the mail
hands him a newspaper article and corn did you say were going home
reads cardinal glick cuts ribbon on catholicism wow
to bartleby and
reads updating the church
to bartleby again and
snatches article give me this getting up reading the re dedication of saint michaels church on its hundredth anniversary is the kickoff of a new campaign that seeks to bring
the catholic church back into the mainstream
with a papal sanction the archway entrance to the centuryold jersey shore house of worship will serve as a passageway of pleanry indulgence which according to catholic beliefs offers all
who pass through its arches a morally clean slate
looks at loki you still dont get it do you
no i dont get it
are we leaving now
they start walking
if you walk through the churchs front door on the day of the re dedication ceremony your soul is wiped clean of any and all existing sin moreso than the
sacrament of penance could ever offer
its a plenary indulgence man
i dont know why i never thought of this before
spits out chewed popcorn into trash can sounds thin
sounds like someone made it up
its rarely employed but its legitimate
it has a papal sanction for gods sake
so youre saying you and i can walk through this doorway and go back home
no by passing through the doors our sins are forgiven
then all we have to do is die
wait wait die
i dont want to die
chews popcorn steps on conveyor belt youd rather stay down here for a few more eons
no but we dont even know if we can die
and what if we can but this archway thing doesnt pan out
spits out chewed popcorn into napkin impossible
if we cut off our wings and transubstantiate to complete human form then we become mortal
and if we die with clean souls theres no way to keep us out
they have to let us in
beat who sent this thing
i dont know
somebody whos looking out for us i guess
does it matter
all that matters is that after all these years weve found a loophole
he cant keep us out anymore
and once were back in im sure hell just forgive and forget
they pass the nun
who leans against a wall still dazed
yeah but this plenary indulgence thing is a church law not divine mandate
church laws are fallible because theyre created by man
one of the last sacred promises imparted to peter the first pope by the son of god before he left was whatever you hold true on earth
ill hold true in heaven
so if the pope says its so god must adhere
its dogmatic law
beat extends hand let it never be said that your anal retentive attention to detail never yielded positive results
accepts hand you cant be anal retentive if you dont have an anus
theres just one thing i think i should do before we leave something thatil get us back on his good side
loki smiles and starts rifling through his pockets
he extracts a magazine article
this is something ive been dreaming about for five years now
the crumpled article displays a barney like gold hued cow alongside various profit charts and text
reading mooby the golden calf creating an empire out of simplicity
loki wipes his mouth and nods to the article
i want to hit them
are you nuts
crumples article were mere days away from getting back and you want to jeopardize it because you have a soft spot for the good ol days
what better way to show ive repented than by resuming the position i denied
thanks to you
a killing spree is not going to make things better for us
were not talking about killing here
were talking about divine justice
were talking about punishing the wicked raining down fire and brimstone
hes all about that
i just know hed want this done
there hasnt been an angel of death since you quit
doesnt that mean anything to you
besides what if youre wrong
if im wrong it wont matter
like you said we pass through the arch and were forgiven anyway they step up to an elevator and press the button
considering it well
he does hate competition
reading article and this mooby deninitely falls under that heading
the church we have to go to is where
the rededication is in four days
the doors open
they get on
other people are inside as well
our last four days on earth
if i had a dick id go get laid
but we can do the next best thing
lets kill people
a guy beside loki reacts
loki smiles at him as the elevator doors close
between black cards with white credits there are shots of the old man from the boardwalk being wheeled into a hospital on a gurney being treated in the emergeny room
being hooked up to life support system and finally resting in an intensive care wing
the church sits on a grassy knoll in mc henry a suburb of chicago
some kids tear by on bikes and egg it
the greater illinois chapter of the right to life foundation will be holding its bi annual softball game against the cook county pro choice league next sunday at two
the priest speaks from the lectern addressing semi filled rows of the faithful
those who find the weekly demonstration outside of the twelfth street planned parenthood clinic hard to make due to work schedules are urged to show their support in the fight
against the thoughtless and wanton destruction of life by cheering on our boys on the field
as always will be served
dollying down the rows while the priest rattles on
we pass the parishoners
some listen intently others are nodding off
one surreptitiously listens to a walk man a man and a woman quietly argue while their kid colors in a coloring book going off the page and marking the pew
two kids play cards one guy leafs through a copy of hustler hidden by his hymnal book
todays second collection will be donated to the john doe jersey life fund
for those of you who havent been following the news an unidentified homeless man who was accosted and severely beaten at the new jersey shore last tuesday lies in critical
but stable condition in one of that areas hospitals
he lacks identification and police have had no luck in tracking down any possible family
while he shows no signs of recovery the arch bishop of the trenton diocese has disputed the states decision to remove the indigent man from life support systems asking that
catholics all over the country join in this protest against euthanasia
and finally will whoever keeps parking in my spot stop doing that
now please rise for the recession of faith
we believe in one god the father
as the congregation flatly joins in the prayer we stop on bethany a beautiful twenty something woman who struggles to stay awake
she checks her watch and exhales softly
i dont really want to be here
a small gaggle of signcarrying right to lifers march in front of the sterile looking building
but then again i guess nobody ever does
except maybe you
the source of the voice a girl sits beside bethanys desk stretching out her gum
bethany offers her an understanding smile
you know ive done this three times now and each time the counselor tells me i should be more careful in the future i should show some responsibility
gotta tell you though this is the first time the counselor wasnt some ugly as hell old bitch
its kind of hard to take abortion advice from a woman whos too gross to get laid in the first place
im not here to lecture you im here to make sure you really want to go through with this
id rather go back to that night when my idiot bovfriend swore up and down he was sterile
short of that there arent many choices left now are there
ever think about having it
beat what woman doesnt on some level
i never did
incredulous you had an abortion
lights a smoke my first year in college
all through high school id dated the same guy walter flanagan
we were really in love right
so much so
that we decided to go carnegie mellon together
thats this college in pittsburgh
so there we are away at school and theres suddenly no parents to worry about anymore so were screwing like rabbits just constanly doing it
and i wound up getting pregnant
so he begs me to have it
he says we should quit school and get married and im telling him that thatli screw up our educations
we fought about it for a week my arguement being there was no rush to have kids you know
we could always have a baby in a couple of years after school
so i got the abortion against his wishes
i mean what the hell it was my body right
after graduation we got married and immediately set about trying to have kids
we tried like hell for the first six months and
so i went to a gynocologist to see if everything was okay on my end
beat it wasnt
takes a drink my uteran wall had this fissure
it seems that the doctor who performed the procedure on me years before had somehow botched it
id never be able to have a child
the girls face says it all
bethany takes a drag and continues
so there i am devastated
and now i have to go home to break the news to my husband who years before had begged me to have the baby his baby
and after i explain it to him through my tears he sits on the couch and rubs his eyes
and in the calmest most rational voice ive ever heard anybody use in my life he asks me for a divorce
and i fought him you know
i tried to talk him out of it told him there were alternatives like we could adopt
and all he said was he wanted a wife who could have his children
beat what happened
he had two kids in two years with his new wife
we never spoke again
and now i do this
such a sad story
i dated this guy a year or two ago he was really into comic books
he told me i had the stock superhero story i wanted to prevent a wrong that had happened to me from ever happening to anyone else
kind of like batman he said
the only difference is i dont put on tights to do it
unless all my other clothes are in the wash
smiles and puts out her smoke so
lets go over your paperwork
a well dressed liz maneuvers through the small thrall of right to lifers
they shake their placards at her accusingly
you should be ashamed of yourself
looking over their shoulders as the thrall turns excitedly in an effort try to spy the imaginary pontiff liz ducks inside the clinic
a newspaper headline fills the frame church says no to death of john doe
its lowered to reveal bethany reading
liz enters and hangs up her coat
youre a catholic arent you
cant you talk to them or something
they hate me more than you no doubt
at least you have an excuse youre ewish you dont know any better
i dont think theyd accept that one we already used it as our excuse for killing christ
so where were you yesterday morning a bunch of us went out for brunch
i went to church
that kills me
you and church
we work in a field that specializes in pissing off the cloth and you add insult to injury by breaking bread with them every week
i sit there every sunday and i feel nothing
i can remember sitting in church when i was a kid and being moved like everything meant something like i was important
and the stories of all these holy people were so inspiring
now i sit there and think about my checking and what im going to wear to work the next day
so then why do you still go
beat you wouldnt believe me if i told you
you think im going to mock your religious beliefs
were friends bethany i may mock you for being a divorce at twenty five whos never had an orgasm but id never mock you for having faith
thats just it i dont
i dont think i have any faith left
making coffee i had a girl in here once bout fifteen
she told me that faith is like a glass of water
when youre young the glass is full and its easy to fill up
but the older you get the bigger the glass gets and the same amount of water doesnt fill the glass anymore
periodically the glass has to be refilled
a fifteen year old who came in here said that
she had gotten knocked up by her pastor
a minister knocks up a teenager isnt anyone afraid of the lords wrath anymore
that would require faith and that commodity lately seems reserved only for the psychotic zealots that hang around outside
collects her things to leave so what are you doing tonight
girl you need a man
if only for ten minutes
its been my experience that the average male is never a man not even for ten minutes in his entire life span
uh oh that sounds militant
you thinking of joining the other side
couldnt do it
women are insane
then girl you better get back to church and ask god for a third option
i think god is dead
the sign of a true catholic
liz exits with her coffee
bethany stares after her
the stygian triplets kneel on one knee before a high backed leather chair upon which sits a shadowy figure who we see from behind
they appear to be in a den or library
all proceeds according to plan
no doubt the powers will attempt to contact the last scion
you know where she is
she must be elliminated befoie she enters the frav
when she is negated there will be nothing to interfere with our plan
shuffle her loose her mortal coil that we may obtain our final glory
the stygian triplets rise and skate off
the fridge door opens and bethany glances around inside
she pulls out a chocolate cake and closes the door
bethany sits on the couch eating cake with a fork and watching the oc t
the theme song to filmations batman and robin cartoon can be heard
she sips some milk from a glass and has some more cake
bethanys in bed staring up at the ceiling
from the darkness a creaking floor board is heard
bethany reacts grabbing a bat from under her pillow
she peers into the darkness defensively wielding her bat
suddenly the room explodes in flames
a huge fire that appears to be shooting out from the floor ignites mere feet from bethanys bed
bethany leaps back taking a beat to stare mesmerized
looking closely one can see an anthropomorphic form standing in the blaze
powerful booming the voice repeats itself
bethany darts out of bed and dashes out of the room quickly returning with a fire extinguisher
while the voice is in mid sentence she blasts the thing with the contents of the canister swirling the nozzle around to hit all the flames
the booming voice sputters and starts coughing losing its impressive edge
bethany stops squirting and turns on her bedside lamp
a choking drenched and coughing androgynous figure in a suit waves her away
the figure coughs up some of the extinguishers contents and drops to the floor hacking
it is metatron
bethany stares shocked
between coughs sweet
have to empty
the whole can
bethany grabs her bat again and holds it up this time offensively
slowly rising to its feet im the one
whos soaked and
shes the one whos pissed
reaching for phone still holding bat im calling the cops
breaking and entering attempted arson
theyre going to lock you up for life
wiping off clothes no dial tone
ear to phone you cut the phone lines
even more offensive with bat get the fuck out of here now
or youll what hit me with that fish
the bat bethany held is now a salmon
she drops it to the floor and freaks
now just sit down on the bed and shut up
oh god youre going to rape me
im not going to rape you
to itself off clothes look at my suit
take whatever you want just dont kill or rape me
enough with the raping already
i couldnt rape you if i wanted to
unzips pants and pulls them off angels are ill equipped
there before her stands the exposed metatron
there is nothing where some sexual genitalia should be its as smooth and anatomically impaired as a ken doll
im as anatomically impaired as a ken doll
rings out pants you meat puppets and your arrogance you think everyones just waiting to rape you
what are you
im pissed is what i am
you go around drenching everyone that comes into your room with flameretardent chemicals
no wonder you dont get laid
pulls pants back on go get me a towel will you
she exits the room and comes back with a towel
she holds it out to metatron who grabs it and starts toweling off
taking off jacket stand back
bethany steps back
metatron flexes and huge fucking wings extend from its back dripping water
bethany goes wide eyed and cowers against the wall
tosses towel away like i was saying i am the metatron
bethany stares saying nothing pinned against the wall
metatron looks insulted
dont tell me the name doesnt ring a bell
bethany remains silent and wideyed
metatron gets testy
if there isnt a movie about it its not worth knowing right
beat i am a seraphim
beat the highest choir of angels
beat you do know what an angel is dont you
bethany slowly nods
metatron acts as the voice of god
any documented occasion when some yahoo claims to have spoken with god theyre speaking to me
or theyre speaking to themselves
beat why doesnt god speak for himself
so glad you decided to join the conversation
to answer that human beings have neither the aural nor the psychological capacity to withstand the awesome power of gods true voice
were you to hear it youre mind would cave in and your heart would explode within your chest
we went through five adams before we figured that out
are you going to kill me
ni etatron i could for what you did to this suit
unfortunately i cant
beat called how
all that from two words
color this angel impressed
beat how do i know youre an angel
oh you mean besides the fiery entrance and the expansive wingspan
you people kill me
you want more proof
how about a tequila
snaps fingers bethany and metatron sit at a table
bethany immediately clutches at her pajamas
metatron waves a waiter over
where the hell are we
the only place one can go for good tequila
to waiter dos tequilas por favor
and an empty glass
the waiter turns to leave
metatron yanks a smoke from his pocket as he goes
were in mexico
actually were in the chillis down the street from your house but it was still an impressive trick lights smoke you dont mind that i lost the wings do you
im trying to keep our profile low
i suppose it would be too cliche to observe aloud that this is the weirdest dream ive ever had
can you imagine how insulting it is to converse with a person and have them insist youre a dream
if i had an ego itd be bruised
what do you want with me
im to charge you with a holy crusade
pause you do know what a crusade is dont you
sarcastically uh yeah
dont give me that
last time i charged someone with a crusade they had to look the word up
why am i supposed to go on a crusade
yours is a heritage divine
also you didnt seem to be doing much lately
the waiter arrives with their drinks
he leaves off the tequila one of the only things your people have mastered since you crawled from the primordial ooze
sips i work in an abortion clinic
spits tequila into empty glass moses was a drunk
look what he accomplished
and no ones even asking you to part an ocean
all you have to do is go to new jersey
go to new jersey and visit and small church on a very important day
that doesnt sound like a crusade
aside from the fine print thats it
whats the fine print
mumbles into glass stopacoupleofangelsfromenteringandthusnegatingallexistence
damn this is good tequila
sips wait wait wait
damn this is good tequila
the first part
spits into empty glass details
stop a couple of angels from entering and thus negating all existence
god i hate when people need it spelled out for them
thats the problem with you people you need every thing clarified
no leaps of faith whatsoever
alright vou want the whole secret origin
here goes back in the old days god was vengeful and hot tempered and his wrath was bore by the angel of death name of loki
when sodom and gommorah were destroyed
that was loki
when the waters wiped out everything with the exception of noah and his menagerie
that was loki
and he was good at what he did
but one day he refused to bear gods wrath any longer
because he listened to his friend a grigori by the name of bartleby
one of the choirs of angels
theyre called watchers
guess what they do
so theyre like guardian angels
exactly like that but different
so one day lokis wiping out all the first born of egypt
the tenth plague
tell a person youre the metatron and they stare at you blankiy mention something out of a charlton heston movie and theyre suddenly theology scholars
may i continue uninterrupted
bethany nods so once hes done with the first born loki takes his friend bartleby out for a post slaughter drink
and over many rounds they get into this discussion about whether or not murder in the name of god is okay
now bartleby can run circles around loki intellectually not to mention the fact that lokis more than half in the bag and in the end bartleby convinces loki to quit
his position and take a lesser one one that doesnt involve slaughter
so very inebriated loki tells god he quits throws down his fiery sword gives him the finger which ruins it for the rest of us
because from that day forward god decreed that angels could no longer imbibe alcohol
hence all the spitting
maybe to you but im a lush by nature
i mean about the angel of deaths resignation
for a liberal yes but this is the angel of death were talking about
the angel of death cant be a conscientious objector
the angel of death is charged with meting out whatever justice god demands
so for their insolence god decreed that neither loki nor bartleby would ever be allowed back into paradise
were they sent to hell
for the entire span of human history
and when the world ends theyll sit outside the gates for eternity
and whats this have to do with me
somebodys clued them in to a loophole in catholic dogma that would allow them to reenter heaven
they beat the system
good for them
its not that simple
if they get in they will have reversed gods decree
now listen up because this part is very important existence in all its form and splendor functions solely on one principle god is infallible
to prove god wrong would undo reality and everything that is
up would become down black would become white existence would become nothingness
in essence if they are allowed to enter that church theyll unmake the world
are these guys that bitter
no thats the stupid part they have no idea what their actions will result in
as far as they know theyre just going home
isnt that sweet
if this is so major why are you talking to me
why doesnt god do something
he could blink them out of existence destroy that church turn them into plants
but hed rather see you take care of this one personally
because of who you are
and who am i
the girl in the p
dont ask so many questions just serve your purpose
i beg your pardon
when some asshole abortion doctor destroyed my uterus where was god
when my husband decided he couldnt be with a wife that couldnt bear his children where was god
now all the sudden after all these years of quiet noninvolvement in my life he sends one of his lackeys my way who tells me i should save the world
and as what some sort of test
to hell with him
do yourself a favor bethany do the world a favor let go of your petty crap
its served you precious little in the past and it serves you even less now when the fate of existence hangs in the balance
dont allow eons of history and life to get blinked out of being just because you have a grudge against your creator
do you know why i work in that clinic
its my own private way of saying fuck you to god
and any other day id say thats your business and your life and enjoy yourself and goodnight
but this isnt about you this is about eve body
so you lost the abiliry to make life
youre being offered the chance to play mother to the world by acting like one and protecting it saving it
swigs her drink and spits it out but i cant make you
youll do what you will
however if you should decide to stop being selfish and accept your responsibility you wont be alone
youll have support
what more angels
prophets although they dont quite get it yet
youll know them right away one speaks the other listens
the one who speaks and he will at great lengths whether you want him to or not will make mention of himself as a prophet
the other one wont say anything but hell be helpful just the same
looks at watch i have to go
youll do what you will but try to remember that were working in a time frame here
metatron moves to exit
metatron turns you work for god
they tell me its god
if its not im going to be severely pissed what with all these years of bossing people around on his behalf and expectorating perfectly good tequila
whats he like
hes got a great sense of humor
look at sex
sex is funny
one time i asked him why you people had to look so stupid while procreating
he said if you didnt youd do it all the time just for fun
but we do
and you all look so damn stupid doing it
it kills us upstairs
sex is a joke in heaven
the way i understand it its mostly a joke down here too
and with that nietatron is gone
bethany looks at her drink
a three man mariachi band surround her and begin playing princes little red corvette
bethany startles awake
the radio on her night table plays little red corvette
she lays back down
bethany sits at her desk staring into space
a twenty something girl speaks butbethanys not really listening
shes extremely preoccupied
bethany shuts off the lights in the various rooms
she packs up her bag and turns on the alarm
bethany exits and locks the door behind her
she starts walking
as her feet tread lightly toward her car three small shadows move toward her
bethany throws her bag on her car roof and rumages through her purse for her keys
she hears something and stops
roller blades can be heard moving slowly across the asphalt of the parking lot
bethany turns quickly
she looks around a bit peturbed
calling into the darkness god what time do you people quit and go home
lets just save it for tomorrow alright
theres no response
then theres the noise of wood being tapped against the ground
bethany peers into the darkness looking for the source
suddenly a skater whips past her slamming his stick into the back of her knee
bethany goes down
another skater whips in and slashes at her but she ducks
the stick hits the car door above her
she rifles through her purse madly until another skater whips by dragging her purse away with his stick
bethany looks up
the stygian triplets are lined up menacingly a few feet from her
they tap their hockey sticks in unison on the ground
bethany jumps up and faces them defensively
the triplets emit an unholy shriek and charge at her
and from out of nowhere a large figure swoops down from above landing on the ground between bethany and her menacers
the triplets stop short and regard the figure curiously
the large figure whips into a defensive stance batman style
the stygian triplets look to one another
they shrug and charge anew
from behind the rock still large figure a smaller figure leaps into the streetlight shrieking flying through the air busting into a flying kick
he lands before the middle triplet and open palm punches him twice in the face grabbing his stick from the falling childs hand and tossing it into the air behind
the stick sails through the night air and is snatched by the grip of the large figure who twirls it under his arm and then back out like a sai
he swings it out before him knocking the other two triplets off balance
the smaller figure back flips into the larger figures arms and kicks his feet into the faces of the two wobbling triplets
they go down and the smaller figure leaps forward with a shriek landing between the fallen pair elbows into their backs
the flrst struck triplet leaps out of the darkness at the large figure screaming something unholy
the large figure catches the kid by the throat and quickly head butts him tossing him to the side
the large figure sways for a beat and then shakes it off
the small figure collects the hockey sticks and throws them into the distance
he kicks at the falien triplets as they scurry away
calling after them more to himself snoogans
the large figure saddles up beside the small figure
they look at one another and shake hands
dude i know they were just kids but we kicked their fucking asses
bethany stares mystified
she grabs her purse from the ground
where did you learn to do
from this comic book some guys made about us
beat i dont know what to say
the figures turn into the light revealing the faces of the heroes for the first time two very familiar faces
say youll offer us sex as a reward
who are you
the large figure lights up a smoke
the small one extends his hand
and this is my business associate silent bob
well thank you for being out here so late
come to think of it what are you doing out here so late
freezes wait a second are you protestors
whats a protestor
youre not with the fight to lifers
you mean those fucks with the signs and pictures of dead babies
me and silent bob are pro choice a woman body is her own fucking business
then i dont mean to sound ungrateful but what are you doing hanging around
were here to pick up chicks
a bit stunned excuse me
we figure an abortion clinic is a good place to meet loose women
why else would they be there unless they like to fuck
taken aback oh
well i should be going
thanks for the rescue
shocked wait wait wait we just saved your ass and youre just going to take off
what the shit is that
i had a weird night last night and now tonights not shaping up to be any better
i think i should go home take some percosets and lay down
opens her car door to silent bob how about that shit
fuck this town man im going back to jersey and selling weed they start walking at least there i can get turned down while trying to make myself a profit
metatrons words echo in her ear
she shakes her head
to herself youve gotta be kidding me
thinks for a beat then hey
she runs up to them
they whip around and raise their fists defensively
beat would you
i cant believe im doing this
inhales deeply would you
like to have a drink with me
jays face lights up
he punches silent bob in the arm
i told you if we hung around outside that place wed get laid
looking skyward thank you god
various guns are laid out atop a glass case
now this piece is nice
its not lightweight but one look at it and nobody i mean nobody is going to fuck with you
try it on
loki picks up the gun
bartleby and the salesman look at him
its a lot more compact than the flaming sword ill say that much
its the weapon of choice these days
it seems unimpressive
at least the sword looked intimidating
how can i strike fear into the hearts of the wicked with this
oh i get it
you want to become a vigilante right
like batman or something
batman never uses guns
off gun i dont know
it feels impersonal
then dont use a gun
just lay the place to waste like sodom and gommorah
now that was something
oh yeah for you maybe
you got to stand there and read
i had to do all the work
you lit a few fires
i rained down sulfur man
theres a subtle difference
are you kidding me
any moron with a pack of matches can start a fire
raining down sulfur takes a huge level of endurance
mass genocide is the most exhausting activity one can engage in next to soccer
to salesman ill take this one
five seventy five to walk with it right now
loki starts sifting through his wallet
an english muffin is covered with a knife full of jam
bethany raises the bread to her mouth and takes a bite
she glances at the oc pair and stops chewing
jay and silent bob study her intently
jay smiles widely anticipatory and nods
all three sit at a small table near a window
bethany puts the english muffin down and brushes off her hands
jays feet are moving a mile a minute
are you both from around here
im hard as hell
do you live in the city
do you have a friend for silent bob or are you going to do us both
if so im first
i hate sloppy seconds
youre a man of principle
where do you come from
we used to live in a small town in jersey
real small town
we practically knew everybody
what brought you to mchenry
see we used to sell smoke in front of this video store
and one day this fuck wants to rent a video
so we did only we didnt have anyplace to watch it
so we went to the mall and popped it into a vcr at macys and sat on the floor and watched it
it was called sixteen candles
did you ever see it
so the next day we rented the breakfast club and then weird science where these two fucks have a chick thatll do anything for them and they dont do nothing
because its a pg movie
but then we got thrown out of macys when we watched pretty in pink because of this bitch
points to silent bob to silent bob whatd you do
you know how at the end the red headed bitch gets together with her dream guy at the prom
bethany nods well pussy here starts fuckin sobbing all sorts of loud and shit
and the managers like get the hell out of here
and im like fuck you you bald cocksucker
ill kick your lard
speeding him along so what exactly brought you to illinois
see all these movies take place in a town called shermer in illinois
and theres all this fine bush running around and we could kick all the dudes asses because theyre all whiney pussies
except judd nelson he was harsh
but best of all there was no one selling weed
so i says to silent bob man we could live phat if we were the blunt connection in shermer illinois
so we collected some cash we were owed and caught a bus
but when we got here you know what we found out
there is no shermer in illinois
what kind of shit is that
fucking movies are bullshit
and now you live here
this berg sucks
everyone talks with a stupid accent so you dont know what theyre saying and its too fuckin cold
we were talking about taking off
until we met you that is
kisses her hand retracts her hand right
so how much longer are you staying here
until youre ready to skip out and make with the sex
how long are you staying in mchenry
were leaving tomorrow
where are you going next
to silent bob jesus this broad asks alot of questions
to bethany back to jersey
weve been going straight for like five years now
its about time for us to retire or something
enjoy our salad years
no more adventures
sips her coffee yeah
so do you do anal
is it true that chicks fart if you blast them in the ass
i didnt ask you out for sex
ill take head
i dont know why but
composes herself i want to go with you
what like steady

shrugs to silent bob alright but silent bob has to live with us and you pay the rent
no i want to go with you to new jersey
youre the only chick i ever met that wanted to go to jersey
most chicks try to get out
when can we leave
wait a second
what is this shit
are we going fuck or not
youre going to lead me somewhere
me lead you
lady i dont even know where i am half the time
if were not going to fuck then what the hell did you ask me out for
someone told me id meet you and youd take me somewhere i was supposed to go
i didnt believe it until you said that thing in the parking lot
what the hell are you babbling about
all i know is we saved your ass from some angry fucking dwarfs and you promised us se
to silent bob didnt this crazy bitch promise us sex
to bethany and now youre telling me that im supposed to take you somewhere and you dont even know where it is
beat do you believe in god
horrified holy shit youre a jehovahs witness
all the fine chicks that come out of that place and we gotta get the one jesus freak
to silent bob getting up lets go
grabbing his sleeve no
pulling back ill scream rape
i can pay you
quickly sitting back down pay
for being my guide
you were going to leave anyway all im asking is to tag along and see where it leads
ill pay a hundred bucks and all expenses
thinks to silent bob i feel like im han solo and youre chewie and shes ben kenobi and were in that fucked up bar
to bethany what about sex
alright but lets say were caught in a situation where weve got like five minutes to live like a bomb or something is gonna go off would you fuck us
in that highly unlikely situation
beat yeah sure
to silent bob what do you think
silent bob shrugs
jay stands up
but ill drive
bethanys car roars overhead speeding down the road reving awfully loudly
the speedometer reads ninety five
jay drives eyes glued to the road
happy as hell
silent bob smokes to his right
bethany sits pinned against the back seat wearing an uncomfortable and dubious look
she struggles to lean forward
the engine still races
yelling over engine noise what gear are you in
not looking back gear
jay silent bob and bethany sit on and against the car
the hood is open and smoke billows out
defensively well what do i know from shifting
like i ever drove before
silent bob shrugs and smokes
bethany walks away shaking her head
silent bob nods and extracts a tool from his jacket
he begins working on the engine as a cross ountry bus races by
bartleby and loki sit in the back
bartleby reads a map and loki stares at the gun in his lap
a couple makes out in the seat in front of them
we have to pass through three more states to get to new jersey indianna ohio and pennsylvania
with a very important stop in cleveland
the angel of death returns
sounds like a bad movie
movies are bullshit
and dont start with me airight
the last time you bugged me about my job you got us sentenced to life in wisconsin
looks out window all this time weve been down here why didnt we ever leave the cheese
he said to stay where he put us
we feared worse punishment if we disobeyed him again
where were we afraid hed send us
now that my friend
beat you know maybe youre wrong about this slaughter
how can you even be sure of what incurs the lords wrath these days
remember when eating meat on friday was supposed to be a hellworthy tresspass
or when people werent even supposed to shop on sundays
that stuff was small potatoes
the major sins never change
and believe me i can spot a commandment breaker a mile away
you dont believe me
looks around eyes fall on kissing couple there
off couple so what
thats a stretch
how do you know theyre not dating
youd know better than me lets hear it
oh i know the truth
but lets see how boned up on the job you really are
so whats your proof
hes wearing a wedding band
maybe thats his wife
no married man kisses his wife like that
you get married and the passion dies man
dont you ever watch talk shows
what are you talking about
a guy makes his best plays when wooing
when the object of his desire is won theres no need to expend the effort anymore
he relaxes satisfied with the spoils of victory which he then decides isnt so victorious because hes saddled with a life mate
very romantic sentiment
thats the problem romance
you think about it back in the old days nobody got married out of quote unquote love
people married for property dowries or to procreate to immortalize oneself through offspring
when did all this love stuff start
what the hell happened to the status quo
lionel richies old group
no thats the commodores
the troubadors were wandering minstrels and dramatists that sang melodramatic and sappy songs of undying love
sounds like the commodores
the troubadors made love fashionable
and their influence altered the balance in a significant fashion
until them people got married because they had to
after them people started falling in love
romantic courtships became the norm
what started out as simple entertainment made such a dramatic impact as to forever alter the way society operates
thats human beings for you easily misled
from the garden of eden to the thigh master thev believe what theyre told
im telling you one day theyre all going to watch one too many john hughes flicks and start looking for shermer illinois
humans are dumb but not that dumb
off couple so is it adultery or not
thinks to couple excuse me
the couple stops kissing
the man looks at loki
are you married
holds up ring finger what do you think
the man shakes his head and goes back to kissing
bartleby offers loki a satisfled
loki taps the man on the shoulder
breaks kiss pissed what
are you married to her
not that its any of your fucking business but no
loki looks at bartleby
bartleby rolls his eyes
loki calmly shoots the man in the head
the bus skids to a halt
people flock off in a panic
after a beat bartleby and loki deboard and stand there alone
youre such an asshole
dont blame me man
blame the commodores
silent bob still tools around under the hood jay hands him various wrenches
bethany steams off to the side
to silent bob shes pissed dude
shell never fuck us now
well maybe you but definitely not me
beat let me know how she is
turns on him nobody is fucking me
you got that
at least not in this car
sighs im sorry i dragged you to that diner
i dont know what i was thinking
but being that ive decided to go home and not to new jersey this is where you two get off
youre breaking up with us
good luck with finding molly ringwald or whoever it is voure looking for
sorry for the inconvenience
bethany starts walking away
jay stares at her shocked
to bethany who the hell do you think you are lady
you cant go around breaking peoples hearts like that
we fell in love with you
guys like us dont just fall out of the sky you know
on cue a naked black man falls from the sky
landing between the two parties
bethany and jay stare at him
the man is face down sooty and ashen as if hes just been in a fire
bethany drops to her knees and rolls him over feeling for a pulse
jay looks down then looks skyward as silent bob joins him
yelling up a beautiful naked woman doesnt just fall from the sky you know
beat to silent bob was worth a try
silent bob nods
bethany presses her ear to the mans chest
do you think he fell from a plane
did you ever see that flick
starts cpring him i think there would have been more of a mess if he fell from that high
bethany jay and silent bob leap back
the man sits up and rubs his face
that sounds familiar
jesus are you okay
and yes im fine
hes the fuckin undead
cut his head off
getting up with bethanys help what happened to your car
you clock ninety in first gear or something
mind your own fucking business
to jay listen goldie locks what i just did was not easy and it ga e me a fucking migraine
now if you dont pipe down im going to rip your balls off
hiding behind silent bob i knew it
mother fucker wants to eat my brain
i think he was aiming a bit further south
to rufus speaking of which youre awfully nude rufus is it
rufus it is miss
to silent bob hey tubby
hows about lending a brother your coat till i can find my own threads
jay looks at silent bob
dude he fell out of thin air
silent bob shrugs and passes his coat to rufus
dude his dick is gonna be rubbing all over the inside of your armor
to silent bob ill do my best to tuck it back brother
silent bob nods
something oc catches his eye
he stares oc and exits
where exactly did you fall from
some might say grace
to silent bob dude hes talking about your mom
jay turns to see that silent bob isnt there
silent bob peers at a large bush at the road side
the bush rustles slightly
you know normally id have a hard time with this but somehow you falling out of the sky seems to go hand in glove with some of the other stuff
ive been deaiing with
believe me you aint seen nothing yet
silent bob peers closer at the bush
suddenly a stygian triplet leaps out at him pinning him to the ground with his hockey stick
the other two triplets leap on top of jay and bethany rufus grabs the one off bethany and hurls him to the side
jay manages to reach into his jacket and pull out a copy of penthouse
he rolls it up and starts beating the kid in the head with it
silent bob gets his hands under the stick that pins him and pushes it up hard into the triplets forhead knocking him off
he rushes to jays side and plies the other triplet from his throat hurling him oc
the triplet silent bob fought punctures the air with his stick and rips downward creating a hole
he grabs his friend and leaps into it disappearing
jay and silent bob look at eachother blink and embrace passionately
the triplet that rufus threw rushes rufus from behind hockey stick in lancing position
without looking back rufus reaches behind himself grabbing the stick and swinging it and the triplet over his head in an arch letting go
the last triplet goes sailing through the hole and it seals shut
bethany jay and silent bob are in various wide eyed states of shock
alright whats with you lady
thats the second time you got attacked by the fucking mighty ducks
wiping off hands man theyre onto you bad already
i got here just in time
how can you be so composed
we were almost killed
death is a worry of the living
the dead only worry about decay and necrophiliacs
i told you he was the undead
not the undead the dead
christ told me the secret to resurrection once when we were at a wedding in canna but i got drunk and forgot it
wait wait christ
you knew christ
i saw him naked
let me guess youre another angel
no im a man just like you and him
looks at jay well maybe not like him
at least i was a man
been dead for nearly two thousand years
pulls rolled up paper from behind his ear no wonder he saw jesus homeys rockin the ganj
unrollingit its not a joint
looks at it i cant read this
it says rufus see you in two years
freaked me out because he basically told me when my number was up
took the flavor out of the remaining years
look we gotta keep moving
if we stay in one place long enough those things are liable to come back
what say we continue this discussion over something to eat
snaps inhales deeply im a rational woman okay
all i want to know is where you and those
kids came from
they came from hell
i came from heaven
walking away lets start walking
do you know how far we are from anywhere
back in the old days with j
we walked everywhere
did you ever hear of a fat apostle
exits bethany looks to jay and silent bob for some guidance or stability
whats an apostle
bethany shakes her head and exits
jay and silent bob shrug at each other
a large office building in downtown cleveland
hasnt started up yet
a pickup truck pulls curbside in front of the structure
bartleby and loki jump out of the back and pat the side of the truck
offering waved thank yous to the driver
as the truck pulls away loki pulls out the article and looks at it
he looks up at the building and nods to bartleby smiling
they head toward the front doors
int qualnt suburban house dawn a ringing phone is answered by the unseen figure in the chair
we move from the seated figure passing by the dead bodies of the homes original owners and come to a stop on the bruised and worn stygian triplets seated on
they look scared
no theyre not in right now
im the phone guy
ill leave them a message
the figure hangs up the phone and rises
you say the girl has already met the prophets
the stygian triplets nod
she grows closer to learning her true identity
if that happens our plan is jeopardized
i cant afford to go into the field that might compromise us further
the best course of action is to insure that our parcel is not found
and being that i cant even trust you enough to kill a girl im left with no choice but to seek outside assistance in guarding our package
sighs im going to have to summon the golgothan
the figure exits
the stygian triplets register shock
rufus now wearing some funky new clothes carries a tray of fast food to an outdoor table
sitting already are bethany jay and silent bob
off new clothes its amazing the shit people throw out
didnt i tell you id find some threads
a car full of teens whip past them
yelling from passing car waves to them thank you
to group whats that mean
it means they saw you pull that shit out of that dumpster
so its a good thing then
handing coat back to silent bob i appreciate the loan brother
you can have this back
to silent bob lucky you
off food damn i remember when all we used to have for breakfast was fish and goats milk
what do you call this shit
to rufus egg mcmuffin
now how about you start explaining some things to me
like for starters who the hell are those kids that keep attacking me
nasty little bastards called the stygian triplets
theyre not really related
when they were alive they were a trio of kids that snatched a neighbors toddler and smashed its skull in just to see what it looked like i believe was
they were killed in a car wreck on the way to a detention center
so theyre dead too
youd be surprised how many dead people are just walking around were stubborn bastards
thing is those kids are supposed to be in hell
which means that someone wants you out of the picture so badly theyre willing to summon demons
is it those two angels im supposed to stop
theyre not evil theyre just stupid
to bethany wait a minute are you going to listen to this shit
we dont even know who this guy is
for all you know hes in with those fucks
they both showed up at the same time
i hate to say it but he does have a point
how did you know where to find us
you know what the dead do with most of their time
they watch the living
especially in the shower
to silent bob i cant wait to die
and why are you watching me
because youre the one whos going to help me get some changes made in that book you all hold so much stock in
whats your beef with the bible
im not in it
neither are any of us but you dont hear us bitching
but im supposed to be in it
i was the thirteenth apostle
ive been going to church my entire life and ive never heard of a thirteenth apostle named rufus
you know all about the other twelve apostles white boys i might add
but no mention of rufus
cause im a black man
but thats just my pet peeve
i mainly want to correct a major error that you people are basing a faith on
jesus wasnt white he was black
rufus bites into his sandwhich
bethany jay and silent bob look at him and then each other
ive seen pictures of jesus and he has blonde hair and blue eyes
wiping hands thats whats particularly insulting
between the time when he established the faith and the church started to officially organize the powers that be decided that while the message of christ was integral the fact
that he was black was a detriment
so all renderings were ordered to be eurocentric even though the brother was blacker than jesse
if thats true then whyd he get written about while you were left out
well he is the son of god right
its kind of hard to have the new testament without him
so you fudge a few facts and put a spin on his ethnicity
leaving me outs okay because theres still twelve apostles to choose from
i dont buy it
thats what the good people of antioch were saying when they stoned my ass
you were martyred
thats one way of putting it
another way is to say i was bludgeoned to shit by big rocks
see christ told us apostles to go out into the world and spread his word
antioch was already garnering a big christian following so i got sent there
and was a big hit
they loved hearing about jesus message and how he was the redeemer
but when i mentioned he was black the whole town turned on me called me a liar and shit
i pressed the point and before i know it im wearing stones although not to accessonze
why didnt you just let the point go when you saw how they were reacting
because its part of the facts
white folks only want to hear the good shit life eternal a place in gods kingdom
as soon as they hear theyre getting all this from a black jesus they freak
and that my friends is called hypocrisy
folks just cant accept a black savior
to silent bob you going to eat that hash brown
so you went to heaven
shit yeah it was the least the brother could do
i gave up my sheep and followed his ass around jerusalem for three years
and in all that time did i ever get laid
but i didnt bitch because i was into his message
and while the message is what counts folks should know that he was black
thats why im going to help you find stop those angels from getting to that church in exchange for you helping me with my campaign
how do you know about that
heavens a pretty boring place and anything that breaks the tedium is news
the unmaking of existence is what you might consider a great tediumbreaker
besides there isnt much i dont know about you
i find that hard to believe
when you were five you let a kid from next door piss on your hand
shocked you did that
but i never told anyone about it
neither did he
he died of leukemia two years later
his name was
your exploits no matter how inane are well known in heaven
probably in hell too
bethany rubs her temples and exits oc
rufus watches her go
intrigued tell me something about me
preoccupied with the oc bethany you masturbate more than anybody else on the planet
shit everyone knows that
tell me something nobody knows
you think about guys when you do it
rufus gets up and exits
silent bob looks at jay shocked
not all the time
bethany sits on a swing in the kiddie jungle gym shaking her head
rufus joins her
im sorty if i spooked you
i just feel
like my life isnt mine exclusively
thats the way it goes with celebrities
what are you talking about
im a nobody
im just a quiet girl from the suburbs who counsels pregnant teens
you sound like christ
he had the same reaction when he found out who he was minus the quiet girl from the burbs angle
and like him im sure youll come to terms and do what youre supposed to
why not get the pope or someone holy like that
just because a guy wears a funny hat doesnt make him the right man for the job
only certain hands can deliver the world from the brink of destruction
last time it was jesus this time its you
cant say yet
but the question is are your hands capable enough to carry the burden
it all rides on you
rubbing her temples two thirds of me wants to forget about this and go home
you know yesterday i wasnt sure god even existed
and now im upto my ass in christian mythology
god hates it when its referred to as mythology
well then lets ask the quote unquote prophets what we should call it instead
looking oc concerned now where did those two assholes go
its your typical strip club
one woman on a stage and a crowd of men paying way too much attention
the place is dimly lit with red lights and chock full of smoke
off to one side a dee jay spins records blasting the music
the crowd is rather thin
jay and silent bob sit at the stage
their eyes glued on
the dancer a gorgeous shapely vixen with very little clothing on and growing littler by the second
jay pokes silent bob who produces a wad of bills
they skim off a nice pile and stow the rest
they spread their piles neatly on the bar
the dancer smiles and starts dancing toward them
jay holds up a five spot and performs his own little seductive dance th it
he stands at the edge of the stage rating
the dancer slinks over and jay stuffs the five in her g string
she rubs his head and slinks away
jay humps silent bobs chair excitedly
bethany and rufus come up from behind them
bethany hits jay
shouting above the music what are you doing
proving to this bastard that i aint gay
long story forget it
but we should get moving
how can we get to new jersey
i had a car
she slaps jay upside the head but riveted by the dancer he doesnt feel it
to rufus we could go by train
looking oc sounds cool
theres a phone out there
ill call for reservations
rufus is now also riveted by a table dancer off to the side
no its okay
i can handle it
rufus half nods
bethany shakes her head and exits
the dancer gyrates on the stage revealing more and more of herself
jay pounds on the stage hoots and dances flashing more bills
across the stage a small gang of bandanna wearing angry looking blacks watch the oc jay with little amusement
the dancer dances toward them
banging on stage sweet thing
hashes another five look what i found
the dancer smiles as she approaches jay but is interrupted by more banging
the gang leader has his foot on the stage
he produces a ten dollar bill from his jacket and casually holds it up
the other three members of his posse smile and slap hands
the dancer shrugs at the shocked jay and changes direction heading toward the gang
jay casts a horrified look at silent bob
the gang leader leans forward preparing to tip when we hear an obnoxiously loud throat learing
jay holds aloft a twenty smiling and nodding
the dancer shrugs at the gang leader and again switches direction
the gang leader looks at his posse who shake their heads at him disappointedly
the stage becomes a bidding table as on one side the gang leader produces two twenties
on the other side jay staring at the gang leader produces three twenties
the gang leader hits his posse up for more cash
jay hits silent bob up for more cash
the dancer stays in the middle gyrating and sizing up the best offer
jay then produces the cremede ia creme three hundred dollar bills
he sneers at the oc gang leader
the dancer heads over to jay and wraps her legs around him from the stage gyrating against his groin
jay stares at the gang leader a victorious smirk on his face
the gang leader shakes his head angrily and jumps out of his seat producing a gun from his jacket
he fires into the ceiling
the music scratches to a halt and the other viewers scatter toward the door
the gang leader points his piece at jay his posse backing him up
you a smart ass aintcha white boy
come in here and ruin my good time
its a free country
the bitch just came to the man with the most
no offense baby
the bitch is gonna be leaving with the man with the most the man with the most led in his piece
while you and tubby are leaving with the most led in your dead fucking carcasses know what im sayin
to dancer step to the side baby
ive gotta slap this pussyass nino brown wanna be down
to gang leader come on kane
this isnt necessary
shut the fuck up and back away from the midget
the dancer moves to the side
to jay now i believe you were about to apologize
i believe you were about to intone some pleas for mercy
you were about to say please mister kane i didnt mean to disrespect you in your club
please accept my most humble apology
bethany comes back and sees the mess
she moves to rush to jays side but rufus holds her back an oc jay laughs
jay leans on silent bob laughing
the gang stares back angrily
you want an apology
cocks gun give me at least one im sorry and ltll put a kill shot through that thick fucking skull of yours
otherwise we go slow and long in the pain dispensation
beat zips jacket closed know what im doing
what you doing
im closing my jacket so that when we start this up i dont get your filthy fucking brain guts all over my shirt
you know why
because you cant get shit stains out of flannel
what im saying is that you got shit for brains
the gang leader and his posse stare silently for a moment
well i appreciate you breaking that down for me but i got it without the explanation
no i dont think you did get it
see theres gonna he some nines firing in here and when the bullets stop flyin your cunt lip ass is gonna be all holes and smoke
you think you can draw on me and walk away
and fuck you you punk ass monkey bitch
yeah i called you a monkey
maybe if you kiss my dick all nice before i cap you ill bring a coconut to your funeral and lay it on your grave stick a straw through it
and stick the other end in the ground
your lipsll reach
the gang stares mystified
rufus and bethany cant move theyre so frightened
you think every white boy cowers at your ass
shit if i dont fucking plant you watermelon my muscle here will
thumbs at silent bob what do you think he is
my boy friend
i love chicks
so hes gotta be with me for one reason to watch my back
silent bob doesnt talk in words he speaks in bullets
res all quiet cause hes thinking about how hes gonna take you and your bitches out quick enough to piss on the bullets in your bodies before they cool down
you know why
because he likes to see the hot steam coming off them when he sprays them down
come to think of it i m tired of talking to your dumb ass you probably dont even understand big words like piss
tell you what ill let him explain it to you
to silent bob silent bob shoot these punk monkey bitches
silent bob slowly raises his hands in a surrender fashion
jay looks at him
what are you waiting for
silent bob shrugs
flabbergasted silent bob kind of nods shocked silent bob indicates the negative sheepishly
beat silent bob raises his eyebrows remorsefully
the gang snickers and smiles
what was that about a coconut
jay shakes his head and glowers at silent bob
what the fuck kind of muscle are you
all this time and you got no gun
we have some unfinished business here
sheepishly can we talk this over
tell you what you got thirty seconds
then i cap you
talk all you like
bethany goes to make a move but rufus holds her back shaking his head
he puts a finger to his lips to quiet her and points back toward the action smiling
to silent bob i cant believe you
to gang leader do me a favor
points to silent bob shoot this piece of shit first
to silent bob disgusted no gun
suddenly they both snap into a momentary trance
zombie like jay and silent bob step to the turntables behind them
jay puts on headphones and begins scratching a record
a familiar tune begins
the gang watches perplexed
silent bob whips around microphone in his hand and begins to sing
the gang slowly goes from perplexity to enjoyment
the gang leader softens and smiles adding a slight nod of approval
jay provides back up
as fat albert bethany and rufus look on
i thought she looked familiar
he nods toward the stage serendipity
bethany looks to the stage
the dancer is the serendipity in question
she wipes sweat from her brow
oh this isnt your standard boardroom this is mooby corp
home of mooby the golden calf which can only be described as a bovine variation on barney sickeningly simple and very non threatening
a large table sits in the middle a media center behind the huge chair at the head
the walls are adorned with framed posters of mooby playing with kids mouth agape in a stupid smile
at the center of the table is a large gold plated statue of the insipid creature
doors open and the boardroom fills with suits six men one woman
they chatter and take their seats
after a beat whitland the ceo enters taking his place at the head of the conference table
good morning shoppers
slaps a file on table has anyone seen the over nights
an anticipatory hush fills the room
we creamed em
a cheer and applause goes up from the group
reading from file and last night was a rerun which says to me that with the six months we have to ready and promote the very nlooby christmas pay per
view special we can produce history making numbers
the record is held by that shock jocks new years thing but i see no reason why our little cash cow cant supercede those numbers and
stops and sniffs the air do i smell onions
bartleby and loki sit behind the thrall on a black leather couch
loki is carving something out of an onion while bartleby looks on
whitland and the rest of the board stare at them
i didnt realize we had guests
who are these gentlemen with
the other suits shrug and look to one another for an answer nobody has
to bartleby and loki excuse me
loki continues carving
bartleby looks at his friend and shakes his head
loki lifts his head without looking up
very distracted hmm
may i ask what youre doing in my boardroom
still preoccupied my friend just has a few words for you and then well be on our way
heading to jersey you see
now by the decor i assume im guessing correctly that this is the corporate headquarters for mooby productions international
you guess correctly
now may i ask who the fuck you are and again what the fuck youre doing in our conference room
to bartleby still not looking up you may proceed mon ami
i cant believe you
to whitland i just want to start off by apologizing
my friend here has a penchant toward the dramatic so hes making me do this
usually i dont even involve myself in his affairs but he hasnt done this in awhile so he wants
frustrated just read em their rights already
sighs circling the table mooby the golden calf
created by nancy goidruff a former kindergarten teacher in nineteen eighty nine to fill a gap in the saturday morning schedule on local network k rel bought by the complex
corporation in nineteen ninety one and broadcast nationally as the the mooby fun time hour it picked up a large following of children ages three to eight and spawns sixteen records two theatrical films eight prime time specials a library of priced to own video cassettes and bicoastal theme parks dubbed moobyworld
beat did i miss anything
whitland and company stare for a beat
you forgot mooby magazine
is there a point to this
grimly you and your board are idolators
whitland and company stare dumbfounded
loki finishes carving and stands beside bartleby
to bartleby how could your forget the magazine
bartleby rolls his eyes
loki turns to the whitland and holds up the sculpture
sets sculpture on table do you know much about voo doo
fascinating practice very close to satanism but not really much of a religion no doctrine of faith
just an arrangements of superstitions the most well known of which is the voo doo doll
sneezes waits continues a mock up of an individual is subjected to various pokes and prods and the desired result is that the individual will feel the effects
to nearest board member call security now
loki throws the knife at the table severing the phone cord
all lines are currently down
to whitland again
i apologize for my friends
frustrated would you just get on with it
miffed to whitland you are responsible for raising an icon that draws worship from the lord
youve broken the first commandment but more than that im afraid none of you passes for a decent human being
your continued existence is a mockery of morality
looks to loki loki nods like you mister bernard
stands behind board member last year you cheated on your wife of seventeen years eight times twice with prostitutes
you even had sex with her best friend while she was at her garden club meeting and you were supposed to be watching your kids
in the bed you and your wife share no less
the board member stares in disbelief
loki nods to bartleby and he moves on
and you mister newman
loki sifts through compact discs
he pulls out one entitled mooby mania and pops it into a player
a simple childrens song echoes through the room
you got your girlfriend drunk at last years christmas party and then paid a kid from the mailroom to have sex with her while she was passed out just so
you could break up with her guilt free when she sobbingly confessed the next morning that she cheated on you
she killed herself three months later
you sent flowers to her wake
the board members face is frozen
bartleby shakes his head and moves quickly around the table
not liking his job mister pereira disowned his gay son mister turran put his mother in a third rate nursing home and used the profits from the sale of her
house to purchase an oriental rug for himself mister barker flew to the phillipines on the company account to have sex with an eleven year old boy mister bloom okayed the production of mooby dolls from what he knew were unsafe and toxic materials because it was less costly
bartleby stops at the female board member and looks at her relieved
you on the other hand are an innocent
you lead a good life and have never misused your power here
she stares at bartleby
loki pats her on the back and urges bartleby on
but you mister whitland
you have more skeletons in your closet than this assembled party
i cant even mention them aloud
bartleby leans over and whispers something unheard into whitlands ear
whitland goes green
bartleby steps back
loki stands beside whitland
youre her father you sick fuck
whitland begins sobbing
to loki can i go now
cheerily rubbing his head go on you crazy kid
loki turns menacingly on the others
with the exception of miss pryce there is not a decent human being amongst you
do you know what makes a human being decent
and therein lies the problem
none of you has anything to fear anymore
you rest comfortably in seats of inscrutable power hiding behind your false idol far from judgement lives shrouded in secrecy even from one another
but not from god
loki goes to exit but pauses
he turns around
i forgot my little voo doo doll
looks at whitland wow
it really does look just like you
maybe if i believed enough
loki begins moaning menacingly slowly waving an open palm over the figure
whitland looks at it horrified then at loki then back at the figure
he sweats and shifts in his seat eyes pinned on the figure
loki lets out a shriek and smashes the figure with his fist
whitland freezes eyes closed
slowly he opens his eyes unharmed
i dont believe in voo doo
loki swiftly exits
the board members sit in awed silence
then the doors burst open and loki storms back in
but i do believe in this
gun blazing he takes out the male board members including whitland in a flurry of bullets
the remaining female board member covers her head with her arms
loki hangs his arm at his side and touches her hair
smiling its okay
youve done nothing wrong
they were bad men
you are a pure soul
she looks at him terrified
he smiles back
then his expression hardens
but you didnt say god bless you when i sneezed
he quickly puts the gun to her head
she slams her eyes shut
loki freezes and looks oc
he grimaces and holsters his piece
to woman sorry
force of habit
he surveys his handiwork and exits
the female board member slowly opens her eyes and looks around
jay and the gang leader sit together at a table surrounded by the other gangsters and silent bob
they laugh and chug their s
to gang watch this shit
to jay do it again g
do the mush mouth
swigs his beer as mush mouth hey buh fat buh al buh bert
the gang laughs hysterically
fat albert like a mother fucker and shit
bethany rufus and serendipity huddle around a table further away
elated i forgot you were down here
how long now
three years this august
what about you is this another temporary expulsion
you and your christ was down campaign
what does that mean another expulsion
i thought you came down here specifically to help me
is that what he told you
rufus gets thrown out constantly at least once a month ethereal time
they always bring him back but only after a few days of peace and quiet free from that black nationalist rhetoric
joking artsy fartsy bitch
who you calling artsy fartsy
to bethany serendipity here used to hang with us sometimes back in jerusalem
let me guess the fourteenth apostle left out of the bible because shes a woman
the girls not a woman
to serendipity no offense
oh those werent tits i saw jay cozying up to
tugs on boobs what these
you should know better than anyone at this table that tits dont make a woman
hell the tubby coat wearing mother fuckers got tits dont make him a woman
aside from an intuitive knack for accessorizing what traditionally defines a woman falls between two things her legs
but as you can see
serendipity stands and unbuttons her jeans dropping them slightly revealing yet another smooth sexless crotch quite like metatrons
i lack definition
theyre getting a free show
serendipity pulls her pants back up and sits down smiling at the oc party
weary oh god
how do you know metatron
to rufus how does she know metatron
this is the last scion
beat youre kidding
dont you see the resemblance
stares at bethany a bit
suddenly nervous oh shit
if shes been tapped then somethings up
bethany serendipity here isnt technically an angel nor is she by any means a human being like i was and you are
amen to that
swigs her beer and spits it out then who is she
not who what
i havent always been part of the anthropomorphic club
i used to be an abstract
now im really lost
serendipitys an idea
try all ideas
im a muse stupid
bethany stares at her for a beat then at rufus
rufus nods affirmatively
i cant take much more of this
downs her beer to serendipity shes now met a seraphim a dead man and a muse
you can appreciate her frame of mind
to serendipity so you what inspire people
what just went down with your friends over there you dont think they thought of that themselves
i knew kanes weak spot for fat albert and passed it along to the boys
if she hadnt interceded theyd be chalk lines right now
you made them sing that song
i offered them a solution out of the hole they dug for themselves
thankfully they took it
are you kidding
those two are so dense they wouldnt get a good idea if it was given to them in a specially marked box
dense people are the most open to suggestion its vou so called intelligent folks that have a hard time accepting a good idea
aint that the truth
give me a good idea
if i do and you accept it then youll have confirmation that you are as you say dense
so youre a muse
so what kind of people do you inspire besides stupid ones
i used to specialize in entertainment literature theatre so forth
in some cases id do everything but bang starlets on the casting couch
what have i seen that youve been involved with
off the top of my head everything
well almost everything
for example im responsible for nine of the ten top grossing films of all time
the one about the kid by himself in his house burglars trying to get in and he fights them off
bethany nods i had nothing to do with that one
somebody sold their soul to satan to get the grosses up on that piece of shit
which brings us to the next logical question what are you doing stripping
well you remember why i left right
you were tired of doing all the work and getting none of the credit for your ideas
and sick of watching incapable people take brilliant inspiration and turn out real trash
to bethany so i opted to quit being a muse and write for myself
i gave my two weeks notice
got a body fifty bucks and got sent out into the world to make my fortune
so what happened
can you believe it
me a muse for gods sake
i sit down in front of the typewriter and what do i get
cant even write a grocery list
what about what you did with jay and silent bob
you inspired them
thats the cosmic joke
i can give out a zillion and nine ideas a second but i cant keep any for myself
her quirky sense of humor
youre saying gods a woman
was there ever a doubt in your mind
the possibility never presented itself
hes always referred to as a him
i didnt write it that way my job stops at the idea stage
the person that holds the pen adds their own perspective and all the pen holders were men
one of the drawbacks to being intangible is that you have no say in the editorial process
another ones that you cant jerk off
to bethany see
these being male dominated times the pharisees and high priests felt threatened by the idea of a woman lording over them and controlling their fates
so they made sure that she became a he doesnt stop with god the whole book is slanted and gender biased a womans responsible for the first sin the fall
of man and the expulsion from eden
a woman cuts sampsons coif of power a woman asks for the head of john the baptist
read that book again some time women are painted as bigger antagonists than the fucking egyptians and romans combined
stunned god is a woman
i dont know what the big surprise is women are the only gender that can create life just like god created the universe
who else but a mother could have the infinite patience with impudent children that god has with humanity
a woman can give birth to and nurture both sexes so psychologists theorize that women are the only gender both sexes can feel completely comfortable with and the faithful both
male and female feel at ease with god
in time of trial our first instinct is to implore the aid of the almighty just as when youre a child the only person who can make it all better
god it makes sense
to serendipity shit you still have a knack for words
not really useful in my new line of work
what about that
whyd you choose stripping
in an effort to create something artistic that i could claim as my own
see ive been able to fool myself into thinking this isnt stripping its dancing and at least dancing is artistic
but she wont even give me that much the way god designed dance its the only creative act which results in no tangible product
unlike paintings poems movies or most other arts forms
when the dance is over theres nothing to show for it nothing to save and enjoy
takes a drink believe me the irony wasnt lost on this muse
how long are you going to keep this up
believe me i think about eating crow and going back to the grind from time to time
but id hate to give her the satisfaction of my playing the prodigal
and it sucks because i cant stand being flesh anymore especially this halfway crap
not only do i have to take care of the aesthetic the showers the haircutting the pit shaving but i cant take advantage of the benefits like getting laid or
using my period as an excuse not to get laid
conspiratorily to bethany the only true boon to having a period from what i understand
well we could sure use your help
we need someone with good ideas
you remember a couple of angels named loki and bartleby
sure the angel of death and his squeamish pal with a conscience
they found a way back
shocked god no
not the plenary indulgence loop hole
you know about that
i always knew that thing was a bad idea
leave it to the catholics to destroy existence
what do you have against catholics
ever been to a catholic mass
once or twice
its like bad sex up down up down kneel leave
and the whole time youd rather be watching t
you people dont celebrate your faith you mourn it
so if were so wrong then whats the right religion
when are you people going to learn
its not about right or wrong its a question of faith
it doesnt matter what you believe in just that you believe
jay and silent bob join them wearing bandannas
they made me and silent bob part of the gang
suddenly the doors behind them blast open pouring light into the onc im room
a huge figure stands in the doorway backlit and acting as a sepia filter the light and vapors surrounding him are brown
deep gutteral hiss not born
shit into existence
our group stares at the oc brute
jay sniffs the air
sweet christ someone wants you bad
what do you mean
whats that smell
dont tell me thats who i think it is
serendipith the stench should say it all
who the hell is it
an excremental the golgothan
a shit demon
the golgothan moves slowly from the door toward the group
the gang join the others
they hold and cover their noses
to jay loading his piece friend of yours
to group is this smelly fuck with us
hes coming for bethany
to gang leader smoke that mother fucker like it aint no thang
i knew id get to wax someone today
the gang charges oc guns blazing while we hold on the group
suddenly the room is filled with screams and wet slurpy noises
the group goes from staring wide eyed to shielding themselves
the noise stops and jay and silent bob look up
the gang lay about noman in trashed dead positions
they are covered in murky creamy crap their wide white eyes frozen in horror
noman scoops a finger full of muck off the leader and eats it smiling
our heroes start backing up slowly as to not be noticed
to silent bob i guess were in charge of the gang now
what the fuck happened
go for the bar
we might have a few seconds his short term memorys for shit
sos the rest of him
no chance of taking him down
i dont know
lets ask the gangstas
youre right lets book
noman snaps to attention and throws its arm at them launching a huge glob of shit through the air
running seeing it coming everyone leaps behind the bar
the shit flies over them and slams against the mirror above
immediately it stretches blob like over the entire frame and burns in an acidic fashion
jay stares horrified
is some powerful shit
serendipity pulls at the floor yanking open a door
bethany rufus jay and silent bob leap into the darkness
serendipity follows pulling the door shut on top of them
our heroes cower beneath the floor door
what is that thing
you ever hear of golgotha
the hill where christ was crucified
peering above yeah well it wasnt just christ up there the romans crucified everybody on that hill
ahd christ excluded they were all criminals killers brigands thieves rapists
and whenever the crucified expired their bodies would naturally lose muscle control spilling bowel and bladder in the process
and the result is that walking pile of crap up there the golgothan shit demon hells chief assassin
and hes here for you girlie
silent bob stares at a crack in the doors
a milky drop of shit drips through it
what are we doing down here then
any second now hell be blasting through that door
if we can sit tight for a couple of minutes hell forget what he came for
suddenly another drop falls
then a steady stream
silent bob taps rufus and points
indicating trickling shit looks like its been taking memory training courses
off trickle the five leap from their perch on the steps just as the doors explode dumping a torrent of crap on the steps
the body of muck morphs into noman anew
noman lumbers toward them
the group attempting to gain their bearings on the floor crawls backwards
noman pulls a piece of himself off rolling it around in its hands
if anybody still remembers any prayers i suggest you start whipping them out
silent bob stares wide eyed up at the approaching demon
and then something occurs to him
he stops backing up and stands
the others continue moving back
bob get down
to silent bob you tubby retard
get your ass back on the floor
silent bob stands like a statue in the golgothans path
the demon snarls a smile moving ever closer
silent bob reaches into his coat and pulls a small canister out
he points it at the beast
a mist shoots out into the face of the golgothan
it pauses looking confused
the shitball in its hand drops to the floor and then so does it
bethany rufus serendipity and jay climb to their feet and crowd around silent bob
they look to the fallen unconscious behemoeth then to silent bob
off bobs canister what was that
silent bob holds the can out to them its a small trial size can of glade air freshener
jay looks at it then at silent bob
reading can knocks strong odors out
way to go
why would you ever carrs this
silent bob sprays the freshener at his ass
the others look at jay
to serendipity who has dominion over this thing
only lucifer can order a killing
but something doesnt make sense this thing never travels alone with its intelligence level luciferd never allow it
it usually has some kind of backup
can you get some answers
i can give it a shot
whats going on
serendipitys going to talk to that demon
can we watch
not a good idea
demons can wreak havoc on the weak minded
fuck you weak minded
me and silent bob can talk to him in his own language
makes the universal metal sign hed understand this
shakes her head to rufus whoever sent this might send mor
i suggest you take the princess and get as far away as possible
to bethany ill do what i can to extract some info from shit boy here
if theres anything helpful
ill get it to you somehow
hugs her thank you
youre a great dancer
im a better juggler
to jay and silent bob you know youre supposed to be prophets
start acting like prophets
you should have seen that thing coming
to bethany why the hell are we getting yelled at
just watch out for bethany
bethany leads jay and silent bob up the stairs
to silent bob man bitch thinks just cause shes good looking she can tell us what to do
she told me that if you behave shell give you head
oh a demond have a field day with you
serendipity and rufus watch them disappear up the steps
beat shut up
you shut up
to rufus nice girl
comes from good stock
you havent told her yet
not the right time
how uncanny is the resemblance
those eves the lips
serendipity looks at rufus
she hits him laughing
he cracks up
then the oc golgothan makes a groggy grumbling noise
youd better go
ill take care of the trash
hugs her good luck
rufus runs up the steps
serendipity tunrs on the golgothan
alright stinky lets see what you know
a suited man stands at a podium addressing a small thrall of reporters
and now to speak on behalf of his holiness catholicism wow
campaign ladies and gentlemen of the press i give you the driving force behind the movement cardinal glick
the reporters clap as cardinal glick takes to the podium
he strikes one as more of an agent than a man of the cloth as he removes his wayfarers
thank you mister flanagan one of this parishs chief patrons who donated the stained glass likeness of our lady of gleeful misery that welcomes you as you enter the church
off index cards ladies and gentlemen of the press few would deny that the catholic church has fallen behind somewhat in the times
catholicism usually strikes the average person as an old fashioned remedy for the ills both moral and psychological of a society that has since left its stringent rules and ornate
rituals on the heap with s and eight track cassettes
and in an effort to disprove that the church has appointed this year as a time of renewal both of faith and of style
so it is with great pleasure that i present you and your parish mere days away from its centennial celebration and the continental united states via satellite with the first
of man revamps that the catholicism wow
campaign will unveil over the next year
applause now what does this mean for the average church goer
are we going to throw out the rule book and adopt a hippie mentality in regards to our faith
were simply talking about a few minor alterations to both the aesthetic and theoretical aspects of a religion that boasts one of the highest membership numbers on the planet
a few applause ring out
thank you thank you
so what are we talking about here
well for example
pulls out crucifix while it has been a time honored and traditional symbol of our faith we have decided to retire the highly recognizable yet wholely depressing symbol of our
lord jesus christ crucified
well look at it
would you relish being a member of a group that uses a man nailed to two pieces of wood as its masthead
of course not who would
ive got enough downers in my daily routine without having to deal with this visual everytime i go to worship
lnstead the church is going to adopt this new more soothing and inspiring sigil which we feel is in line with our new outlook
glick pulls a cover off an object to his right a two foot figure of christ smiling and giving the thumbs up
the crowd buzzes
isnt this better
how could you not feel just great walking into a church and seeing this behind the priest a positive reinforcement that whatever we do god thinks is a kay
i love this thing its so
interupting cardinal glick has the church given any thought to its position on john doe jersey
will he be given the right to die with dignity
another buzz rises from the crowd
glick rolls his eyes
were not here to talk about that
its an issue we stand firm on euthanasia is a big no no just like abortion
why wont you people accept that
besides were here to talk about this little guy your friend and mine
the happy jesus
cant you just see it on chains around peoples necks and as the new background in avant garde mtv videos
the image of the happy jesus thumbs up and all is captured on a t
monitor a label reading u e via satellite red bank
new jersey at the bottom of the screen
bartleby and loki look up at it then at one another
and you say siskel and ebert have no influence over this culture
were getting out of here at just the right time
these people are nuts
and thats the church were heading to
steps to ticket window if you want to go home
to woman in window two tickets to new jersey please
jerseys sold out sir
are you sure
the computer says
come on how many people can possibly be going to new jersey
enough to fill a bus
to loki you had to drag that judgement out
you couldnt just hit and run
to woman whens the next one
same time tomorrow
doesnt this place warrant at least two buses a day
i take it youve never been to the garden state
bartleby and loki look around
theres no one else here
then i guess its lunch time
she shuts her window we should have learned to drive a long time ago
infinite celestial power and we cant catch a bus
just shut up this is your fault
you can either lament over our mass transit folly or you can listen to my suggestion
its your suggestions that prevent us from negotiating what should be a simple matter of catching or staying on a bus
why fall victim to gravity when we can just as easily rise above
stares at him fly
we got wings right
lets use them
i wouldnt suggest that
the pair spin and gawk
azrael leans in the doorway
he removes his hat revealing two stubby horns
you wouldnt want to stand out now would you
noman is tied to a chair in the middle of the floor
serendipity draws a circle around him with lipstick
she takes a glass of water and throws it into no mans face
it roars to life
the golgothan shakes of his daze turning his attention on serendipity
noman the muse
they told us you were up here
matter of perspective
i like to think of it as down here
i have a few questions for you sir
noman free us from these binds that you may have answers
heads toward it okay
stops sarcastic oh wait
im smarter than that
noman lets out a bellow
face it big guy im not releasing you until i get answers
this can go hard or easy
the sooner i get what i want the sooner youll be free
now you can start by telling me why youre on this plane
noman beat liquidate the last scion
that wasnt so hard
now who sent you
was it lucifer
noman laughs in a sinister fashion
noman our master is no one and all
for a time he will be prince of this world and the fate of those who dwell in it will be at the mercy of his whimsy
and then he will sever reality and crush existence like a thumb punctures a fontanell giving peace to those whove been without for so long
did bartleby and loki send you
noman resist no further muse
deliver over to us the conflicted one that this world may die screaming
no power divine or inherited threatens the crusade
you cannot win
soon will rise of the cry of the abandonned begging your god to put an end to the madness
and only as being becomes not will they know that the god of abraham lay dormant while the dream perished in a blink
your god is not dead hes brain dead
she you chauvinist bastard shes brain dead
and no shes not
stop trying to be so spooky
tell me who sent vou or ill use whatever influence i have below to make hell even worse for you
noman you speak of azrael
he laughs we pity you
youre still playing the old game
the one that could have made good on your threat is gone
what do you mean
noman no soul escapes hell but one
beat as if its heard something would that i could cross the threshold of your confining circle i would crush your half life throat
but my master does not abandon me to this mockery of a prison
we will come back for the girl
and when we do it will take more than fragrant mist to keep our hands from crushing her head
noman goes stiff and then limp
his body begins to melt
azrael leads bartleby and loki through the aisles passing tons of stuffed animals
jesus christ azrael howd you get out of hell
i told them i was coming up on a routine possession
i dont have much time
if they figure out my ruse theyll come looking for me
to azrael whyd you bring us in here
because you two fucks are inches away from getting yourselves caught
going around killing people about to uncase your wings
dont you have any idea whats going on
were going back home
are you so clueless as to think you can just waltz back into heaven
were going back clean
let me let you in on a little secret okay everyone is looking for you
both sides above and below
the orders are to terminate you on sight
youre pissing people off thats why
word on the grapevine is that gods pissed off at your presumption and i know lucifers pissed because you assholes might just succeed where hes failed so many times making
him look bad
so theyre going to kill us
theyre going to try
thats why you have to travel incognito tone down your behavior stay off their respective radars
go about this thing more subtly
quit killing people thats high profile
and for gods sake dont uncase your wings until you have to transubstantiate
because the minute you let them flap legions of thrones and hordes of demons will fight each other over who gets to kill you first
a woman and her small daughter walk past
while the woman looks at the items on the top shelf loki pulls off azraels hat and taps the daughter on the shoulder
he points to azraels horns
the woman pulls the daughter further down the aisle oblivious to the trio
mommy that man had horns
azrael grabs his hat and puts it back on
thats the kind of shit im talking about
oh lighten up
still reeling i cant believe they want to kill us
believe it boys
theyve even got the last scion looking for you
this is big
im telling you
your re entry is a thorn in a lot of sides and theyll stop at nothing to prevent it
if thats the case then why arent you hunting for us too
because i want to see you go back
you were both given a raw deal almost as raw as mine
if you make it back then i figure theres hope for me
looks around in the meantime i suggest you find an alternate mode of transportation
if anything else comes up ill contact you
thank you azrael
youre a true friend
would you expect anything less from a demon
i have to get back to the pit before they get suspicious
turns to leave hey az whats it like down there
is it as bad as they say
give you a hint theyve been playing mrs
doubtfire continuously for two years now
exits looks at bartleby shit man that is punishment
the train chugs through the darkness
bethany and rufus sit across from one another
they stare out the window
how you coping kid
just when i think ive got a handle on things
something wholely unbelievable presents itself
sometimes i wish i had just stayed home
you sound like the man
beat what was he like
the brother was centered
i mean he was god right
but i think he felt left out because he was more than human you know
we used to sit around the fire me and the other guys and wed be talking about what ass holes the romans were or getting laid
some things never change
and hed just sit there listening and smiling
wed ask him why he never joined in the convo but he said he just liked to hear us talk about anything
said it was like music
i think he just wished he had unimportant shit to talk about himself
how does he feel now
he still digs humanity but it bothers him to see the shit that gets carried out in his name wars bigotry but especially the factioning of all the religions
he said humanity took a good idea and like always built a belief structure on it
having beliefs isnt good
i think its better to have ideas
you can change an idea
changing a belief is trickier
life should malleable and progressive working from idea to idea permits that
beliefs anchor you to certain points and limit growth new ideas cant generate
life becomes stagnant
that was one thing the man hated still life
he wanted everyone to be as enthralled with living as he was
maybe it had something to do with knowing when he was going to die
but christ had this vitality that ive never encountered in another person since
you know what im saving
he was big on life
it was more than that
he was the only person i ever knew who never engaged in that most ancient of life affirming activities
thats the only way people know how to reaffirm that theyre alive by debating
in all its forms
people spend their whole lives debating we fight about whos right and whos wrong we fight ourselves we fight each other we fight death we fight over beliefs we fight
we believe that to stop debating in any fashion is to stop living and give up
people say that lifes a struggle but its not
life is living
im even guilty of it myself the way i go on about christs ethnicity fighting for the truth to come out
and im dead
even in death the only way i know how to live is through debate
thats sad isnt it
not if you believe its important for people to know
a beliefs a dangerous thing bethany
people die for it
people kill for it
the whole of existence is in jeopardy right now because of the catholic belief structure regarding this plenary indulgence bullshit
and whether they know it or not bartleby and loki are exploiting that belief and if theyre successful you me
all of this
ends in a heartbeat
beat all over a belief
rufus looks around
i havent seen the moron twins in awhile
they went to the lounge car to smoke
getting up ill go find them make sure theyre not getting into any trouble
im going to catch a few zs
forgot how tiring living can be
bethanv heads off rufus looks out the window then shuts his eyes
bethany enters and spots jay and silent bob talking to an unseen party
you two arent getting into any trouble are you
just about to smoke a bowl with our new friends
and who are your new friends
they just got in at the last stop
silent bob moves over revealing the new friends
this is larry and barry
bartleby and loki smile at bethany
jay tells us youre going to sleep with him
the train rushes over head
loki jay and silent bob pass a joint under the table and take quick hits trying to remain casual
jay pounds the table happily
bartleby and bethany lay on either side of the table in their booth
you can smoke up with them if you want
you dont have to keep me company
its a long trip
therell be plenty of time later
beat so why are you heading to jersey
theres just this thing there im supposed to do
how about you
were going home
do you two live together
do you live with those guys
not they just sort of adopted me
theyre funny as hell
the big one never says a word
i wish the little one would take a cue from him
but theyre okay as far as stoners go
larrys taken an immediate shine to them and he usually hates people
how longve you two been together
hes great company
he can be a little flaky sometimes but weve got a lot in common
howd you meet
we were stationed together
and everyones always up in arms about this out in the military issue
what do you mean
well theres all that macho bullshit about it being this mans army
and you two meet and hook up while in the service which is so special because its so hard to meet anyone you can seriously relate to
catches on you think were lovers
no were not gay
laughs oh god im sorry
i just assumed
we live together and all but at the end of the night i go to my room
and he goes to his
do i come off as gay
laughing no not at all
my ex husband kind of fouled up my relationship awareness barometer
thats the nice way of putting it
i consider it being dumped
i was dumped once
more or less
its terrible isnt it
dont you constantly question your value like why was i so easy to cast aside
didnt i have merit
and you wonder if the other partys going to come to their senses and call you back
the worst is that i still think like a couple
after all these years i still have the we mentality
mine grew out of what was really a stupid misunderstanding
a misunderstanding that grew into a total withdrawl of communication
and even though it was years ago theres not a day that goes by that i dont wonder what went wrong
and then it hits me i was replaced by someone
a lot of someones
and they always tell you itll hurt less with time
when actually it hurts more
beat you know what we need
we need some drinks
a lot of drinks
do you agree
rufus continues to slumber
jay is asleep on silent bobs shoulder drooling slightly
loki talks with silent bob
im telling you man its all about organized religion and societys battle against it
the rebels are fighting the empire right
now the empire is led by whom
its led by the emperor
and the emperor is a practitioner of the force albeit the dark side of the force
and the force is basically a religion
silent bob nods so the entire galaxy is under imperial rule and the imperial government is run by this old religion
what you have then is a theocratic government a government run by the church
so luke han and leia are fighting that government to liberate the galaxy from the pious grip of what is in essence holy mother church
silent bob nods in understanding
bethany and bartleby slump in their booth the table loaded with empty glasses
bethany is quite tipsy
bartleby sips his drinks and surreptitiously spits it out
youre saying you still go to church
laughs every sunday
does it do anything for you
thinks gives me time to balance my check book every week
thats what im talking about
people dont go to church and feel spiritual
they go to church and feel bored
but they keep going
out of habit
or in habit if youre a nun
that wasnt very funny at all
a friend of mine told me that church is like bad sex its messy and theres no foreplay
starts laughing no
thats not it
i am so buzzed
when do you think you lost your faith
i remember the exact moment
i was on the phone with my mother and she was trying to counsel me through what was happening to me and my marriage
and she said something like theres always a plan
just got so angry
i mean i know she was talking about god right god had a plan
but i was like what about my plans
like dont they count for anything
i had planned to grow old with my husband and have a family wasnt that plan good enough for god
beat apparently not
swigs her drink how about you
when did you lose your faith
one day god just stopped listening
i kept talking but i got the distinct impression that he wasnt listening anymore
and how do you know she was listening in the first place
thinks i guess i dont
i hate thoughts like that
but they occur to you with age
when youre a kid you never question the whole faith thing gods in heaven and hes
shes always got her eye on you
id give anything to feel that way again
which is why i guess i let myself get talked into this pilgrimage
i needed proof
and the opportunity presented itself to find out if it is like they told us in catholic school
and i gotta tell you the last few days ive come across some interesting people that lend toward convincing me
wheres this pilgrimage to
he looks around and stretches
bethany and bartleby continue their discussion
youd never believe me if i told you
but i warned you
okay im going to this church in new jersey
rufus heads toward the back of the car
he opens the door between the cars and exits
bethany and bartleby talk further
i was told that im supposed to stop a couple of angels from entering the church
laughing this sounds so stupid
theyre trying to get back into heaven
rufus passes through another car and opens the door at the end
bartleby grows very tense
bethany rattles on half toasted
see they got tossed out of heaven years ago right
and if they get back in it proves god wrong
and since god is infallible to prove her wrong would
laughing hard would unmake existence
i feel so stupid just saying it
bartlebys eyes are wide
he looks scared
then a calm falls over him
laughing but the thing i dont get
is how do i stop an angel
i guess im supposed to talk them out of it or something
bartleby surreptitiously slides a knife off the table
maybe youre supposed to kill them
bethany breaks into hysterics
rufus pulls open another door and exits
bethanys still cracking up oblivious to the on the defensive bartleby
even if that was the case
how do you kill an angel
i dont imagine its much different
slowly lifts the knife from killing a human
the door behind them slides open
rufus steps in
where the hell is everybody
i wake up and
he sees bartleby
they both freeze
stumbling to her feet rufus i want you to meet my friend barry
bartleby leaps out of the booth and grabs bethany holding the knife to her throat
dont be such a show off
take it easy bartleby
just let her go and lets talk about this
after all this time this is what it comes down to slaughtered by this meat puppet
there doesnt have to be a slaughter
we can work this out
is that a knife
we can work it out alright
im going to work the blade in and out of her thorax
calling over shoulder loki
loki catches the action and reacts
holy shit the apostle
he leaps from the table
jay stirs and wakes up
jay half asleep i didnt come in you i swear
looks around bartleby with bethany in hand faces off against rufus
loki joins them
to rufus what are you doing here
theyre here to thwart our journey home my friend
this one just told me that shes supposed to stop a couple of angels from entering a church
you think she was talking about us
id say there was a pretty good chance
what do you say rufus were to be liquidated
it doesnt have to go down like that
you havent thought about the consequences of re entry
i have to agree with him
no one not you and especially not this finite lifer no one is going to impede us
were going home regardless of whose pride it may hurt
its not a question of pride its
loki kill the girl beat what are you high
i cant kill her if she hasnt done anything you know that
and it looks like shes on the job so to speak
ill kill her myself
a hand lands on bartlebys shoulder
oblivious to the situation hey man now its your turn
we got enough for a fatty boom batty biggety blunt
bartleby turns the knife on him
not quite getting it yet we having cake or something
loki backhands jay stunning him
dazed in grates
jay drops to the floor out cold
silent bob grabs loki and hurls him down the aisle
rufus grabs bartlebys knife hand
silent bob jumps over loki and opens the back door of the car
he grabs loki by the collar
cant we talk about this
he throws loki out the door off the train
rufus squeezes bartlebys hand
bartleby drops the knife and punches rufus in the face
bethany jumps on bartlebys back covering his eyes
they careen down the aisle toward silent bob
he pulls bethany off bartlebys back and kicks him out the back door off the train
he quickly slams the door closed and leans against it
the bartender stares at him
silent bob brushes off his coat and thumbs toward the door
rufus rubs his jaw
bethany crawls up beside him breathing heavily
i should have known something was wrong when he paid for all the drinks
a door is kicked open
loki enters brushing himself off
the apostle is here
if thats the case then chick with him must be
the scion id imagine
leans against the wall slides down in a panic well shit man
maybe we should rethink this whole thing
i mean you heard the guy he said there were consequences
azrael tells us were marked
maybe theres more to this than we thought about
bartleby leans against the wall sitting on the ground
his demeanor has changed
he stares into space
there sure is
beat its them
shakes his head them
thinks the movie about the giant ants
them the humans
its what it all comes down to
us against humanity
kind of like that giant ant movie
beat are you alright
im better than alright
ive had an epiphany my friend
when that sweet innocent girl let her mission slip i suddenly understood it all everything
for the first time in all these eons i get it
beat get what
in the beginning it was just us and him
angels and god
and then he created the humans
and he gave them more than he ever gave us
ours was designed to be a life of servitude and worship adoration
but he gave the humans more he gave them a choice
they can choose to ignore god choose to acknowledge him
all this time weve been down here everyday i felt the absence of the divine presence
and it pained me
as im sure it must have pained you sometimes even though youd gloss over it with jokes
but we feel his absence and why
because of the way he made us as servants
had we been given free will we could ignore the pain
you know maybe you should take a nap or something
loki dont you get it
its the humans its always the humans
they were given paradise they threw it away
they were given this planet they destroyed it
they were favored best among all his endeavors and some of them dont even believe he exists
their ego mania corroded hell and made it dark and crimson
looks at loki i asked you to lay down your sword years ago why
because i felt sorry for them
and where did it get us
smiles weve paid our debt
dont you think its time we went home
and to do that i think we have to dispatch our would be dispatchers
wait wait wait kill them
youre talking about the last scion for christs sake
and what about jay and bob i mean those guys were alright
dont my friend
dont let your sympathies get the best of you as they did me way back when
scion or not shes just a human
and regardless our sins are forgiven by passing through that arch
no harm no foul
that sounds thin
well cover ourselves
well take out a slew of people
maybe amidst the body count he wont notice
oh thats being realistic
bartleby reaches out and grabs loki slamming him against the wall
im going home loki
and nobody not even the almighty himself is going to make that otherwise
bartleby releases loki and smiles
loki watches him
another newspaper headline regarding john doe jersey fills the frame
it is lowered to reveal jay bethany and rufus sitting around a makeshift fire in the middle of nowhere
jay rolls a joint
silent bob reads the paper
i dont understand why we couldnt stay on the train
you threw those guys off
a very basic strategy if your enemies know where you are then dont be there
and whats with that
why are we enemies
the guy almost gutted me for gods sake
he had the knife at your throat
to gut you hed have to have the knife at your stomach
semantics that dont even answer mv question
well i know id perceive the person sent to kill me as my enemy
what do you mean kill
i wasnt asked to kill them just stop them from going into that church
and how were you going to do that
preoccupy them with a game of bingo
ive never killed anything before in my life
ill do it
shut the fuck up little man you couldnt kill a pint of ice cream let alone an angel
fuck you i can kill an angel as good as the next guy
how would you do it
id give him a van damme neck break like in hard target
djou see that flick
ignoring jay to bethany killing an angels a two step process first you have to cut off their wings
which then makes them human
from that point on its the same as killing anything else head or heart take your pick
you say it as if its easy
oblivious to jay problem is i dont think we could pull it off even if we wanted to
all this time away from the divine presence should have made those two weaker and those guys felt far from weak
either that or someones protecting them someone with juice
so then were screwed
shrugs shit thats the best news lve heard in days
this doesnt excuse you from tryng to stop them
count me out
youre telling me theyre unstopable im exhausted both psychologically and physically the odds are against us
i say we kick back and wait for the end a little non xistence might be just what the doctor ordered
im with her
i dont care about dying so long as were all going to die
what are you babbling about now
if i was the only one thatd bother me because every one else would go on living having a good time without me
but if we all go at once thatd be okay because i know im not missing anything
you know its right when even hes making sense
besides she said if we were in a situation where we were going to die in like five minutes shed have sex with me and silent bob
so youre suggesting she throw in the towel and let eons of work and history get blinked out of existence just so you can get laid
just so me and silent bob could get laid
now that were all but in total agreement on this id just like to finally know why me
because youve got nice tits
i wasnt talking to you
to rufus why me
why do i have to do this
nobodys come clean on that
out of everyone on the whole god damned planet
how come i got tapped
rufus looks at her
that shows funny as hell
to bethany do you know what the apocryphal books are
bethany shakes her head no
most of that information in the bible came from the dead sea scrolls ancient text discovered in a cave ages ago
and when the sanskrit was translated they discovered data that conflicted with the lore church officials had already established as the basis of their religion
they couldnt refute centuries of dogma so they thought it best to leave certain passages out sometimes whole books
those books make up the apocrypha
whats this have to do with me
youve never gotten the complete picture
if they had compiled the material together like they were supposed to youd get the whole story
but by leaving text out the church has presented you people with an extremely sterile and unmoving account of religious history
the entire old testament the history of christ
lets her take it in forget about my whole black angle for a minute
we might if youd quit bringing it up
rufus backhands jay
silent bob holds jay back
rufus continues oblivous to jay
he goes from twelve years old to thirty
whole volumes of text about the eighteen year struggle with his divine nature prior to his acceptance of it were thown out forever lost to the faithful
i dont buy it
integral material like that would give people a better understanding of the nature of god
why leave it out
because it was all closely tied in with his family
his mother and father
his brothers and sisters
beat wait wait wait jesus didnt have any brothers or sisters
mary was a virgin thats why its called the immaculate conception
mary gave birth to christ without having known a mans touch thats true
but she did have a husband
and do you really think hed have stayed married to her all those years if he wasnt getting laid
the nature of god and the virgin birth those are leaps of faith
but believing a wife never humped her husband thats just gullibility
sudden realization all the time from what i understand
jesus used to tell me stories about hearing them through the walls when he was a kid
beat so you ask why you got tapped
ill tell you why a christ was the salvation of this world once before
and youre the closest thing to a christ that still walks
the blood that flows in your veins shares a chromosome or two at the genetic level with the man you call jesus
hand on her shoulder youre his great grand niece
bethanys jaw drops
a high pitched squeak of a word escapes her lips
takes a hit from his joint so
that would make bethany part black
to silent bob man this is just like when vader told luke he was his father
i just wish i knew what the hell were supposed to do now
you must go to the dagobah system and find yoda the jedi master who instructed me
everyone turns around
metatron leans against a tree
lve always wanted to say that
mimicking his shock the apostle
sits down with them now you show up
where were you when that psychotic bastard had a knife to my throat
i told you youd be in capable hands youre not dead are you
what are you doing here anyway
i felt left out
everyones sitting around coming clean i thought id join in with a confession of mine own
now whos this mother fucker
this is the voice of god show some respect
the voice of god
wheres the rest of him
funny you should mention that were not sure
didnt it ever occur to you that this bartleby loki situation was well within the realm of his control
if thats the case then why was bethany tapped
you know those constitutionals he likes to take
i think were beyond euphemisms at this point
to bethany gods a skee ball fanatic
lets not altogether blow some of the mystery that surrounds him alright
to bethany yes the lord has quite a fancy for the game been playing it for years he assumes a human form once a month and indulges
doesnt tell anyone where hes playing just goes away for a couple of hours
its quite understandable a small exercise in hand eye coordination has been proven as a highly effective means of therapeutic relaxation
and from what i understand he always gives his free points away to neighborhood children
isnt that sweet
but she hasnt come back from one of those day trips is what youre getting at
to rufus she
i take it shes met the muse
to bethany no she hasnt
and weve been unable to locate her
maybe he was killed
human form has that drawback
no theres a different sort of foul play afoot children
whomever has set the renegade angels on their path and is keeping them quite well hidden
is also responsible for the lords whereabouts
were he to be killed in human form hed have immediately returned to paradise
somebody knew enough to keep the body alive but incapacitate him in another fashion hes trapped in a body
so gods not dead
hes brain dead
so it would seem
and as omnipotent as we are above i have to admit that were more or less lost without his presence
weve had our people looking everywhere for him
and i tapped her because i thought we might be able to smoke out whoevers behind this
but whoever it is has been clever enough to send some lackeys after you as opposed to showing up themselves
can it be lucifer
thankfully they seem oblivious to the situation in the nether regions
i know theyre not responsible at least not lucifer
if he was hed have made his move by now to conquer heaven
and i know hes not responsible for bartleby and loki because hed have just as much to lose by their return as everyone else
then what about the golgothan and the triplets
dont be stupid demons arent exclusive to hell
anybody can summon one
silent bob hands jay his newspaper and points
dont encourage them
and why did you lie to me
you said i was tapped as a test
no you said that i just didnt correct you
you were shocked enough how do you think you wouldve taken it if i told you the face of god belonged on the back of a milk carton
so what do we do now
i say we get drunk kids because im all out of ideas
off paper why dont we just ask this guy to close the church
i beg your pardon
hands group the paper reading glick takes heat for campaign
its the guy in charge of the church thing
reading cardinal glick has come under fire for the blatant pandering and questionable direction of his church sanctioned catholicism wow
when asked about his motivations for decommisioning the traditional baptismal fonts in favor of the proposed olympic sized lap pools beneath parish floors click responded come on who doesnt like
a pool party
maybe you could tell him to shut down the church
if its closed on that day those guys cant get blessed or whatever right
good lord hes got a point
i think silent bob had a point
but sure we can go to him and explain the situation somehow
youre back in
well mine is a heritage divine
and i wouldnt want to let down the family
smiles off silent bob well well well the prophets finally live up to their titles
silent bob shrugs
jay is trying to look down serendipitys shirt
she back hands him
two cartoon altar boys sift through their bowls of cereal
the same boring cereal again
a cheesy cartoon christ floats down from above
man cannot live on boring cereal alone
jesus pulls a box of hosties cereal from his sash
why not try hosties
cl on cereal pouring into a bowl
its shaped like eucharistic hosts
new hosties is fortified with vitamins and minerals topped off with an angelic kiss of frosting that stays crispy in milk
christs hands on their shoulders the altar boys down their cereal happily
hosties is an important part of any nutritious breakfast and each one is blessed by a high ranking vatican monsignor good for the body and good for the soul
but make sure youve confessed beforehand
altar clutches at his throat gasping
smiling benignly youre forgiven
altar stops choking and continues eating happily
so try a bowl of hosties
and dont just take my word for it
a cartoon pope pops out of the box eating a spoonful of cereal
a hand switches off the t
pan up to cardinal click all smiles
doesnt it pop
rufus lay and silent bob are at a total loss for words
after a long beat does it come in chocolate flavor
the cardinal picks up a golf putter and begins putting into an overturned glass
now this ones got vision
to jay were rolling out the flavors in september
big cereal month with the kids back to school and all
its a bit
and thats what were looking to do shake these people up a bit get them motivated
thats the whole point of the campaign
mass attendance is at an all time low in this country
and its not like were losing them to the protestants or baptists people arent practicing at any denomination these days
if we can sell them some show let em know the catholic church has some panache we can win them back even get some new ones
fill them pews people thats the key
and cross promoting like with the cereal tie in grabs the little ones as well
hook em while theyre young
sits at his desk lights smoke kind of like the tobacco industry
oh if only we had their numbers
but we are aiming for the same demographic even though mine is the soulsaving biz
and if i have to play a bit of the devil to bring them closer to the lord then ill wear the cloven hooves and carry the pitch fork
jay and silent bob adjourn themselves from the group and approach a hat rack where the cardinals cassock and miter hang
jay nudges silent bob
we really appreciate you seeing us this late in the day your emminence
my friends and i have been traveling all night in hopes of getting a chance to talk to you about the saint michaels re dedication ceremony
the cardinal blows smoke rings
youd like to help out in some way
wed like you to cancel the ceremony and the re dedication
pauses mid ash tap i beg your pardon
silent bob stands alone by the coat rack
jay leaps into the frame cassock tied around his shoulder like a cape
he strikes a superman pose
theres going to be a world of trouble if tomorrows ceremony goes forward as planned
the cardinal leans back in his chair
what is this a threat
are you planning some sort of demonstation
pause are you pro choicers
no the troubles not from us
its from these renegade angels whove been stuck on earth since the plagues
rufus side kicks bethany nonchalantly
these guys who think theyre renegade angels
see padre it goes down like this the boys believe that by passing through the archway they can get to heaven
granted its far fetched but the brothers are convinced its the truth
silent bob watches as the miter appears slowly from behind the partition resembling a shark fin
it swims to and fro menacingly
silent bob shakes his head
and you want me to call off the ceremony
bethany leans forward in her seat
theyre very passionate about it
they could turn violent if they walk through that arch and nothing happens
these guys could blow and if they do theyre going to take some people with them
call this thing off
beat who sent you
someone from the council of churches right
somebodys upset that were getting so much publicity is that it
who was it
we were sent by him who is called i am
standing time to go
play time with the cardinal is over
to bethany worked for moses
stay out of this
to glick your emminence its not a joke
these guys are an accident waiting to happen
and if the re edication ceremony goes on as planned
then these loonies will show up and go nuts thus endangering the lives of all assembled including the governor the press me the leaders of the council of churches
heck lets not stop there maybe even god himself
you cant say himself it could be a woman
rubs temples your passion for all topics insignificant including the gender of our almighty lord tests my patience people
now im a very important man with very important matters that demand my attention so if youll please
im telling you man
this ceremony is a mistake
the catholic church does not make mistakes
what about the churchs silent consent to the slave trade
and its platform of non involvement during the holocaust
beat alright those were mistakes
but one can hardly hold the current incarnation of holy mother church responsible for oversights of old
now ive indulged you for more time than i should have
losing it tomorrow goes off without a hitch
do i make myself clear
i did not labor two years and exhaust eve ounce of my being to insure that this ceremony be a cornerstone in the most important liturgical event since vatican two
just to cancel it at the zero hour at the insistence of a wandering band of pranksters whove targeted me as the focus of their evenings merriment
this occasion is important for the congregation of this parish for the massive crowds coming for the plenary indulgence for me for his holiness the pope and most importantly for
the catholicism wow
and neither you nor any other influence short of the hand of god
glares at bethany him self will prevent it from occurring successfully
he violently grabs the miter shark fin swimming behind the partition
ay slowly looks over the partition
the sun slowly rises
the day has arrived
amidst very little traffic two figures emerge from the shadows on the pennsylvania side
bartleby and loki step purposefully past the green sign that welcomes motorists to new jersey
the place is empty except for bethany rufus jay and silent bob and a i can almost see the headlines if there were going to be any existence erased thanks
to some prick in a scarlet cape
its a crime that a guy like him even gets to wear a scarlet cape
that aint no crime
you wanna see a crime
look what we stole from the guy in the dress
to silent bob hand it over
silent bob pulls a golf club from out of his coat
oh my god
were going straight to hell i know it
you stole the cardinals driver
i told him to
you know how much these things are worth
thats at least a couple of sodas and a pack of smokes right there
what do we do now
let them keep it
in a couple of hours it wont matter anyway
not that about bartleby and loki
we have no choice but to try to kill them
to rufus but you said they couldnt be killed
correction they wont be killed
the gang turns to see azrael sitting at the bar
and just to insure that were all going to sit tight right here until the two idiots pass through that arch
he wasnt talking about you two
theres only one idiot here
bethany and rufus react as does the very surprised azrael
serendipity stands in the doorway
and thats you
just in time to join us for a drink
suddenly noticing azrael hey
whered you come from
and thats where im returning to in approximately
checks watch onehour
alright plato sounds like youve had enough drinks already
come on barkeep just one drink for the road
then im gone
serendipity joins bethany and rufus
i was trying to find you to tell you id figured out who was behind all this
is that who i think it is
none other than
who is it
thats my worst suspicions confirmed
the bartender relents
alright one drink
then youre gone
gimme a holy bartender
never heard of it
to the group he doesnt know how to make a holy bartender
you know dont you muse
ignoring her anybody
well i know how to make a holy bartender
azrael pulls an uzi from his coat and blows a dozen holes in the bartender
the stygian triplets burst through the doors and everyone jumps to their feet with the exception of the bartender who dies
sweet jesus azrael why
rushing him cmon demon lets see you try that shit on a brother whose already dead
the stygian triplets cross their sticks in front of rufus to block him as azrael trains his uzi on bethany
joining them you maintain that kind of an attitude and you and the barkeep wont be the only corpses in the room the christ bitch will join you
i cant believe youre behind this
are you really that stupid
do you know whats going to happen if those two jerks enter that church
im actually counting on it
and if my calculations are correct the pawns are moving in to check mate as we speak
everyone stares at azrael with the exception of jay
he suddenly laughs
i get it
thats a good one
a formidable crowd of parishoners surrounds a small stage ten yards from the front of the church
banners hang every ere heralding catholicism wow
as well as the centennial of saint michaels
the media eats it up
cardinal glick stands at the podium all smiles
hes in mid speech
id also like to acknowledge this great states governor elizabeth dalton for coming out an helping us ring in the first hundred years of this little parish true
shes a protestant but we wont hold that against her
crowd laughs now let me just give you a bit of history on this particular little hundred years young house of god
this is no longer gods house
god doesnt live here anymore
the crowd turns aghast
bartleby pushes his way through them sheepishly followed by loki
hes grown weary of your superficial faith and has turned a deaf ear to your lip service prayers
he is no longer amused and has abandonned you his favorites to the whim of judgement
hypocrites and charlatans prepare to taste gods wrath
whispering maybe we should just go
you wanted your body count you got it
this lot is rife with sin
well judge them all
glick grabs a cop from the crowd and pushes him toward the pair
these are the two i was warned about officer mcchee
please assist them off the church grounds
the cop grabs bartlebys arm
alright mouthpiece lets leave the nice cardinal alone and go for a ride
bartleby grabs the cops hand on his shoulder
mister mcghee dont make me angry
you wouldnt like me when im angry
is that so
well lets just
bartleby throws his other hand forward and twists the cops head around in one brisk motion
lokis eyes bug out
the crowd takes flight
releasing dead cop ladies and gentlemen you have been judged as guilty of violations against our almighty lord
and this very day i assure you you will all pay for your tresspasses
to loki wings
im not so sure
azrael still hosts his captive audience uzi trained on the mortals
the stygian triplets surround them brandishing their sticks
youre a muse too
he was kicked out
tell them serendipity
tell them how i was slighted by the almighty
you got what you deserved you yellow shithead
ever the apple polisher
id hoped that when you left paradise you did it finally because you couldnt tolerate the injustice that was visited upon your own brother
hes your brother
we were created at the same time
to compliment one another
two spirits of pure inspiration
so what happened
lucifer got restless and started his little war for the throne
heaven became divided into two factions the faithful and the renegades
the ethereal planes were chaotic with battle angel against angel
and when it was all over cod cast the rebels into perdition
but azrael refused to fight
he wouldnt ally himself to god or lucifer
he remained in the middle waiting to see who came out victorious
what are you some kind of fucking chicken
i was an artist
i was inspiration
a muse has no place in battle
our job is to create not destroy
so after the fallen were banished to hell god turned on those that wouldnt fight and my brother here was sent down with the demons
something he considers a grave injustice
dont tell me that you never questioned the judgement serendipity that you dont think the almighty acted too rashly
youve been waiting for millions of years to ask me that havent you
its been on your mind since the moment you fell
its been gnawing at you this long
it never bothered me and ill tell you why you stood behind your office you prick
so you were an artist big deal
elvis was an artist but that didnt stop him from joining the service in time of war
thats why hes the king
and youre a schmuck
so all this is about revenge
youre going to unmake existence because you have a grudge against god
after the first million years revenge was the farthest thing from my mind
self preservation became the only necessity
escape from hell became my all consuming reason
so i studied the religions and waited for my opportunity to present itself which flnallv did
in the form of the plenary indulgence and while i couldnt exercise it myself
i knew the perfect vessels through which i could free myself from torment
bartleby and loki
after that it was a simple matter or waiting for a church to celebrate their centennial and when that finally happened applying some of the old inspiration tactics bv sending
the pair an article laced with ideas
an incantation i picked up in the pit kept them cloaked and off heavens radars and aside from the triplets and the gologothan no soul in hell had a clue
as to what was going on
smiles wont proud lucifer weep when he realizes i triumphed over the power in a way he never dared or dreamed
shakes it off but no plan no matter how intricate could succeed if the almighty was in the realm of the quick
so i dispatched him in a fairly ingenious fashion
ive seen way to many bond movies to know that you never reveal all the details of your plan no matter how close you may think you are to success
suffice it to say the catholics have been even more helpful in insuring my success than by just supplying the clean slate archwav
gets up the only x factor was the involvement of the last scion
im amazed that someone up there would have the balls to make a move without the lords say so
believe me i sweated when you stumbled upon my boys on that train
but alas here you are powerless to stop the inevitable
look asshole i dont know if anyone explained the rules to you but if you succeed everything gets blinked out of existence even you
beat human have you ever been to hell
i think not
do you know that once hell was nothing more than the absence of cod
and if youd ever been in his presence
then youd realize thats punishment enough
but then your kind came along and made it so much worse
humans arent capable of one hundredth the evil a shitbag demon like yourself is
evil is an abstract its a human construct
but true to his irresponsible nature
man won t own up to being the engineer of evil so he blames his dark deeds on my ilk
but his selfishness is limitless and its not enough for him to shadow his own existence
he turned hell into a suffering pitt fire wailing darkness the kind of place anyone would do anything to get out of
because he lacks the ability to forgive himself
it is beyond your abilities to simply make recompense for and regret the sins you commit
no you choose rather to create a psychodrama and dwell in a foundless belief that god could never forgive your grievous offenses
so you bring your guilt and inner decay with you to hell where the horrid imaginations of so many gluttons for punishment give birth to the sickness that has infected
the abyss since the first one of your kind arrived there begging to be punished
and in doing so theyve transformed the cold and solitude to pain and misery
ive spent eons privy to the flames inhaling the decay hearing the wail of the damned
i know what effect such horrors have on the delicate psyche of an angelic beihg
beat would you like to glimpse pain eternal
azrael places his hand over bethanys eyes
for about ten seconds we see some of the most fucked up and disturbing imagery that can be crammed into frames of film
azrael pulls his hand away
bethany is fried convulsing uncontrolably
id rather not exist than go back to that
and if everyone has to go down with me so be it
holding up bethany youre still thinking only about yourself you fuckmg child
now now now
things are getting too tense in here
what say we watch a little t
grabs remote control put on channel nine davey and goliath
a stygian triplet smacks him with its hockey stick
i was thinking more along the lines of current events
on the t
a sweaty and panicked reporter barks into the camera obscuring the chaos behind him
screams are heard
i repeat men with huge fucking wings have laid waste to st
bullets dont seem to affect them
police who were on the scene are dead
the remaining crowd has dropped to their knees identifying this as the fabled apocalypse
im not a man of faith but im inclined to agree with them
looking oc pulls gun please
he puts the gun in his mouth and fires
the screen goes blank
snapping off tv
you see that
and i told them to keep a low profile
id be pissed but in a couple of minutes it wont matter anymore
while he speaks serendipity looks to silent bob
silent bob snaps to attention and locks eyes with serendipity
he looks to the golf club then back at her
azrael suddenly catches the exchange between the two
now what was that all about
i had something in my eye
getting up bullshit
what are you trying to do serendipity get the guy killed
now whos the fucking child
what did you tell him to hit me with the golf club
are you serious
picks up golf club im a fucking demon and youd have him assault me with athletic equipment
hands club to silent bob well here then take it
call it a gift
stands back and hits his own chest take a shot take your best shot
cmon cmon bright boy
the stygian triplets snicker
silent bob stares at azrael perplexed
dont you know anything
silent bob looks to serendipity
he shrugs and swings the club with all his might into azraels chest which caves in blowing muck and shit everywhere
rufus jay and serendipity turn on their captors grabbing the stygian triplets by the throats
bethany leaps over the bar pushing over the dead bartender and blesses the melting ice filled sink
serendipity urges rufus and jay to follow her with the triplets in hand
they submerge them head first in the sink
cruddy steam and muck blows out of the water
the triplets convulse and fall still
azrael clutches at his sucking chest wound dropping to his knees
he grabs silent bobs leg
silent bob kicks him onto his back and out cold
joining silent bob what the fuck have you been eating
silent bob shrugs
what just happened
collecting hockey sticks he said it himself hes a demon
you hit a demon with an instrument of god the pure sides always going to do the most damage
silent bobs an instrument of god
no but the driver is
catching on and glicks the kind of asshole that would bless his own clubs for a better game
and the sink
youve got that divine heritage going for you sanctifing is just one of the fringe benefits
remind me to try the water to wine thing at my next party
to jay how far away is this church
three towns over about five miles
weve gotta make tracks people there isnt much time left
rufus grab his gun
ten steps ahead of you
going through dead bartenders pockets we can take the bartenders car i dont think hell be needing it anymore
bethany and serendipity rush out
we gonna make it
was jesus down
rufus and jay exit
silent bob stares down at azraels body
jay comes back and yanks him out the door
cardinal click runs to a pay phone
sweating and bloody he looks a mess
he presses and looks around wildly particularly skyward
to god look if you didnt like the cereal thing we couldve gone in a different direction
to phone as he speaks a large shadow falls over him from above
it grows larger enveloping click
he drops the receiver drops to his knees and screams
bethany jay serendipity silent bob and rufus stare oc horrified
bodies bodies everywhere partial whole bloody hanging burning upended
no one is left standing
its a scene straight out of hell
bethany buries her face in rufus chest
and people wonder why i dont go to church
are we too late
to save these poor schmucks yes
but we still exist
where are they
they could already be in the church
which means that if they come out nobody touches them
are you shitting me
the brother here is going to shred them with his schwarzenneger special aint you homey
if theyve passed through that arch they come out clean
and if they die they go straight up and we know what happens then
what if they just kill themselves
they cant its a mortal sin
you die with a mortal sin on your soul and you burn
theyd go to hell and thats not what theyre after
so then what the fuck are we supposed to do
just wait for a solution to fall out of the sky
on cue a body plummets out of the sky and hits the ground before the group quite like rufus had way back at the start
this body however bursts apart like a body would if dropped from a large height
jay looks at rufus
friend of yours
it was a cardinal
they all turn to see loki leaning against a body or two drinking from a bottle of champagne
his wings lie beside him filthy blood spattered and ashen
he looks exhausted
rufus trains the gun on him
kind of hard to tell with his face like that but the rosaries are a dead giveaway
goes for the uzi struggling to stop him she slaps the uzi out of jays grip
it clatters to the side
to jay dont you listen
we cant touch them
i wasnt gonna touch him i was gonna shoot him
looking skyward hes been at it for awhile now
in the distance above a mere shadow against the sky something winged soars and stops releasing what looks like a very panicky human being
we ran out of parishoners so he just started picking up anyone off the street
youre looking at eons of repression getting purged
if only wed been able to jerk off
loki drags himself a few feet backwards
id step back if i were you
they jump back just as the body hits the ground and explodes
bethany charges at loki grabs his lapels and shakes him furiously
to rufus i thought we werent supposed to touch them
i think our bethans about hit her ceiling
loki slaps bethany away non chalantly
this wasnt my idea
i just wanted to go home
takes a big champagne swig we both wanted to go home
but he snapped
when he realized who you were and what youd have to do he just lost it
smiles you know whats funny about it
he never could stand to see me work
he said he always felt son for you people that you didnt know any better
looks up now look at him
this guys drunker than hell
which means hes human now his wings have been cut off
slapping loki to sober him up loki
recognizing her the muse
havent seen you in a long time
whats with the tits
loki have you walked through the arch yet
have you gone in and come out through the archway yet
bartleby lands beside them draping his wings at his sides brushing himself off
we were awaiting your arrival
bartleby listen to me
you cant go through with this
azrael was just using you
if you go back this way
bartleby slaps her down
ive become aware of the reprocussions muse
i know what im doing
bethany leaps at him all fists and fury
you sick twisted fuck
look what youve done
look at all youve done
bartleby subdues her
he strokes her hair
bethany you of all people should understand what im t ing to accomplish here
you too have been abandonned
you know what its like to be cast aside
but while youve only felt the devastating effects for a few years ive dealt with it for millenia
and while you never see your ex husband or how blissful he is with his new wife
picks up her face and smiles at her and he is
drops her head seeing you people everywhere
everyday trapped on this perfect little world he created for you
its a constant reminder that though my kind came first your kind was most revered
and your kind knows forgiveness while my kind knows regret
a lesson must be taught
all are accountable
steps back soon a cadre of police will arrive just in time to kill us as we exit the church
and then this failed experiment called existence will cease to be
loki stumbles to his feet
let you do this bartleby
he sways as if drunk i didnt know we
would end existence
to bethany my compatriot
genocide takes a lot out of him
and more importantly
hes now a human being
a condition that carries two liabilities a conscience
bartleby pulls a knife and guts loki
he stares at bartleby as he dies confused and betrayed
serendipity nods to rufus and silent bob
and a short life span
in a whisper to loki sorry old friend but you lost the faith
rufus and serendipity and silent bob jump bartleby and start throwing punches
silent bob bites his wing
jay grabs bethany and pulls her behind a bush
peering out from behind hes lost it
were absolutely fucked
pulling off clothes i hear you
i cant believe this shit
were on the brink of nonexistence and gods still nowhere to be found
what the fuck kind of deity gets kidnapped
pulling open pants amen to that
suddenly notices him what the hell are you doing
id say weve got about five minutes left to live the whole worlds going to end
you said youd fuck me
are you a complete lunatic
everyones out there battling that thing and you want to cower back here and jump my bones
we have to go down fighting
no no time for that foreplay stuff just sex
its all over nobodys gonna beat that thing
now we can either lay here all comatose like that john doe jersey bastard behind us or we can make with the love
what did you say
make with the love
i just said that to be sensitive
usually i call it boning
no about john doe jersey
that guy the one that they wont take off life support john doe jersey
this is where hes at
saint michaels hospital over there
points behind them there across the street sits a hospital
thinks wheres the nearest boardwalk
look i aint got time to win you a prize or something we gotta get to it before
scared asbury park
about five miles away
you ever been there
really scared once
i was banging this girl who worked at the carousel
she wanted to do it on the ride but i got sick and started puking
grabs his face piss scared high pitched yes
bethany kisses jay hard on the lips jumps up and looks over the bush
warming up now thats more like it
rufus and serendipity battle bartleby his wings thrashing about
silent bob is getting back on his feet
silent bob looks to bethany
she waves him over and bends back down to jay who half closes his eyes and puckers his lips
bethany pinches his lips together and raises jay to his feet ust as silent bob arri es
to jay whatever you do stall bartleby from going into that church
to silent bob bob come with me
