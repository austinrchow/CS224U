training ground westminster barracks london day
through a veil of dust we see two lines of uniformed cavalry stretched out across the parade ground
theres a tense silence except for the occasional flourish of hooves
a horseman steps out of each line
lieutenants harry feversham and john durrance face each other across the wide expanse
already we feel the keen sense of competition between them
durrance raises his sabre first
his horse sets off at a slow trot
his troops follow in perfect time
harry waits a moment then raises his own sword
a sea of sabres rises up in response
the two lines approach each other at a steady canter
a smile of anticipation lights up durrances face
hes a born soldier enjoying himself
harry looks more nervous
hes not as easy as durrance in the saddle
its a skill hes acquired over the years rather than been born to
durrance seems to sense harrys doubt
with a loud whoop he kicks his horse into a gallop and points his sabre forwards
his troops echo his war cry and descend on the opposing line at speed
harry checks his troops and responds
the two lines bear down on each other hooves thundering sabres pointed
durrance charges recklessly
his eyes are fixed on harry all the time
harry holds his gaze but doesnt look as sure of himself
hes thinking too much trying too hard
his horse senses it and slows a fraction
the troops behind him lose their cohesion as they draw level
durrance sees the momentary lapse and waves his men on at full tilt
they pass through harrys troops in a perfect line panicking their mounts cheering triumphantly
harrys formation loses its shape
theres no doubt whos won the drill
durrance wheels his horse around and grins at harry through the clouds of dust
changing room westminster barracks day
moving through clouds of steam we see the cavalry officers washing themselves in wooden bathtubs
theres a din of voices soldiers re living the days drill those on durrances side still crowing over their victory
durrance walks with his arm around harry
with them is another friend lieutenant trench a squat bull of a man
how many does that make it harry
harry its not something i count
how many trench
harry trench cant count
trench grabs harry in a neck hold
he lets go as he spots another friend of theirs lieutenant castelton sitting in a bathtub staring out
trench sneaks up on castelton and ducks his head under the water
castelton comes up spluttering
he reaches for a bar of soap and hurls it after trench
willoughbys rooms barracks day
a fifth friend lieutenant willoughby stares at himself in the mirror
his hair like his uniform is perfect
theres a loud knocking on his door
trench o s miss willoughby miss willoughby were waiting
willoughby finally stops preening himself as he hears his friends picking the lock
he gets up reluctantly taking one last look at his reflection in the mirror
the officers pour out of the barrack gates in full regimental unifom a sea of gleaming red
we pick out harry durrance trench willoughby and castelton laughing amongst themselves taking turns to tease each other inseperable
carriage hansom cab london streets day
the friends share a flask of whisky as they sit in the back of the carriage
willoughby passes it on without taking a sip
harry who are you planning to impress tonight
trench grinning anna whats her name
anna whats her names father more like
dont think were going to take you any more seriously when youre promoted
willoughby quietly confident well see about that
a chorus of mocking ooohs from the others
trench notices castleton staring out of the window
trench whats so interesting about a london street
reflecting ask me that when were in bombay
trench rolls his eyes and turns to durrance
trench is ethne going to be there
we catch a hint of shyness in durrance at the mention of ethnes name
i think so
harry watches durrance a little uncomfortably as if hes holding something back
party india office building london night
carriages line the entrance to the india office
indian valets in turbans and robes escort the guests to the entrance holding umbrellas over them
the five friends crowd under a single umbrella
willoughby makes sure hes in the middle he doesnt want to get his uniform wet
trench nudges him into the rain
the durbar court party india office night
palm trees and fountains dominate the room
the ladies are dressed in ballgowns the officers in regimental colours
the full pomp and ceremony of empire is on display
harry durrance willoughby castelton and trench have gathered by the bar a little overawed by the occasion
trench admiring the passing women im going to ask someone to dance
willoughby admiring the passing generals you said that ten minutes ago
trench im waiting for castelton
castelton stares at the aristocratic women paralysed with shyness
trench pouring him another drink just look dreamy
ill do the talking
durrance smiles as he listens to them
he turns to harry
can you see ethne
harry not yet
harry seems uneasy again
we sense theres something on his mind something he wants to tell durrance
durrance doesnt pick up on it
he finishes his whisky and looks back into the throng
harry your father
harry looks away from durrance
he sees his father general feversham shaking hands with some colleagues across the room
seating area durbar court india office night
general feversham is deep in conversation with his friend colonel sutch a fellow veteran of the crimean war
harry moves discreetly into their field of vision
his face lighting up harry
immediately we feel the bond between father and son
harry greeting colonel sutch how are you colonel
relieved to see a few familiar faces
when are you boys shipping out
harry next month
your father and i served in bombay
there are worse places they could have sent you
harry yes sir
harry smiles politely
sutch is sensitive enough to see that his mind is on other things
he lets father and son talk

they both smile as if they share a secret
general feversham reaches out and straightens his sons collar trying to make him look as presentable as possible

willoughby i dont know about that sir but i agree with colonel hamilton were going to have to fight the mahdi sooner or later
willoughby trails off leaving colonel hamilton to continue
bar area the durbar court india office night
durrance downs another whisky
he looks less sure of himself in this social whirl than he did in the barracks
a few women cast admiring glances in his direction but he doesnt notice them
his eyes keep searching the crowd for ethne
seating area durbar court india office night
harry gazes through the crowd at durrance
durrance catches him staring and raises a glass
the two friends smile at each other

ethnes eyes search the crowd as soon as she walks through
she stops as she sees durrance at the bar
her eyes stay on him a moment but its only to see if harrys nearby
when she realises he isnt she looks away
finally she sees him standing with general feversham and colonel sutch
she takes her father dermods hand and leads him in their direction
bar area the durbar court india office night
castelton and trench are back at the bar arguing
your sole purpose in life is to annoy me
trench she couldnt see me
i could see you
i can see you everywhere i look
pulling those stupid faces at me
willoughby now ladies
durrance joins in the laughter but he seems distracted
he takes another gulp of whisky and looks around the crowd
his eyes stop as he sees ethne
a smile lights up his face but its short lived
across the courtyard harry appears greeting ethne
their hands touch briefly
the noise fades in durrances head
he stares in silence
harry shakes dermods hand warmly
dermod slaps him on the back as if hes congratulating him
durrances eyes take in the smallest details now
even though he cant hear a word the scene before him reveals itself more and more clearly
colonel sutch raises his glass
general feversham dermod and caroline adair respond
harry and ethne move closer a little coyly as if the toast is for them
durrance looks pale
we feel the disappointment in his eyes as he realises whats happened
harrys arm moves around ethnes waist a libery that can only mean theyre engaged
fountain area durbar court india office night
harry and ethne glance at each other tenderly
did you tell them
harry i was waiting for you

harry not even jack
the two of them look towards durrance for the first time
bar area the durbar court india office night
durrance looks up as ethne and harry make their way through the crowd
he gathers himself and walks towards them concealing his feelings congratulations
harry how did you know
nothing escapes me harry
kissing ethne on both cheeks im delighted for you both
harry wanted to tell you before anyone else
its my fault
i asked him to wait
ill still blame him
harry relieved that his friends taking it so well you were the one who introduced us

the friends let out a cheer as they realise whats happened
they crowd harry and ethne congratulating them

harry takes ethne in his arms
harry smiling ironically alone at last
trench claps loudly as they dance
castleton looks embarrassed by his friend
behind them willoughby congratulates dermod and general feversham
bar area the durbar court india office night
durrance watches the celebrations from the bar
hes smiling to himself but its the glazed smile of someone whos forcing himself to be happy
a quiet voice interrupts him caroline o s wonderful news isnt it
durrance turns around to see caroline ethnes friend gazing at him
smiling automatically yes it is
had harry told you
i knew it was just a matter of time
changing the conversation what can i get you to drink
nothing thank you
nervous under her gaze id ask you to dance only im not sure how steady i am on my feet
with the quiet confidence of an older woman id love to dance
durrance grins sheepishly at a loss as he is with most women
dance area the durbar court india office night
the waltz is in full swing
all the friends are out on the dance floor
trench spins his girl around energetically exchanging glances with other women as they pass
castelton stares into his partners eyes already in love
willoughby dances with an elderly woman probably some generals wife
durrance waltzes with caroline avoiding her meaningful glances looking over her shoulder for harry and ethne
party india office building london night
the rain pours in torrents
harry and ethne stand in the shadows of the building
harry tries to kiss her and hold an umbrella over her at the same time
what if i hold the umbrella
harry id have to kneel
nothing wrong with that
harry hands her the umbrella bending under it
with irony as he kisses her more and more passionately youre very distant tonight
harry im locked in a barracks room all day
what are you going to do in india
harry take you with me
a hindu wedding
harry why not
not on your life
she walks away with the umbrella leaving him exposed in the rain
i want the full works
the church near my home
a long speech from you
an entire regiment crossing swords
harry drenched done
i dont believe you
harry makes a rush and grabs her eneveloping her in his arms
youre soaking wet
whose fault is that
ethne squirms but loses herself in his embrace
as they start to kiss theyre suddenly interrupted by trenchs braying voice in the distance
trench o s a regimental song goodnight ladies
goodnight ladies we hate to see you go
harry shakes his head in despair
trench castelton willoughby and durrance together o s merrily we roll along roll along roll along
merrily we roll along until the morning comes
harry feels the quiet regret in her voice
harry weve two days leave before we sail
once i tell them were engaged im sure theyll give me more
as long as you promise to make me miserable
argue with me all the time so i dont miss you a bit
her lightness is forced
harry youll be fine
you dont have to reassure me
im a soldiers daughter
everything under control
harry ive never kissed a stiff upper lip before
trenchs voice bellows out again as they kiss trench o s goodnight ethnes
goodnight goodnight goodnight
harrry and ethne ignore him the rain falling all around them
regimental hall westminster barracks night
the regimental song turns into a deafening roar
all around the mess hall officers are laughing and banging on tables
harry and durrance stand on wobbly stools downing pints of beer
as soon as their glasses are empty they set off down the hall at a sprint
its an obstacle course
the two friends duck under two long tables and crawl on their bellies towards two more glasses
trench and castelton are busy laying bets on wholl win
durrance and harry step over a bridge of chairs
they have to find a pint of beer hidden under one of them
durrance finds his first
trench looks at castelton smugly convinced hes going to win
harry and durrance step walk over two long benches
durrance falls off
harry overtakes him
he throws his head back and finishes off another pint
castelton stands up cheering
harry and durrance are level as they reach the last glass
as they start to drink harry stops spluttering
harry this isnt beer its whisky
trench down in one
harry drinks again but hes fallen behind
the pint of whisky disappears down durrances throat
grinning he makes his way towards the finish line
harry pours the whisky over his head conceding defeat
training ground westminster barracks london day
an obstacle course of a different kind
the cavalry are training galloping at full tilt harry and durrance bringing up the front
at the sound of a bugle they dismount their horses and sprint towards a row of bayonets
they snatch up the weapons and charge a row of dummies
the blades tear into the dummies exposing soft leaves and hard wood
hold the line
the officers charge towards a second set of targets
teeth bared they drive their bayonets into the stuffed dummies
casteltons blade sticks in a chunk of wood
in and out castelton in and out
castelton pulls in frustation
he cant get the bayonet loose
theyre coming at you boy
rip it out or theyll stick you first
castelton puts his foot on the dummys head and tries to wrench the blade free
even though its only a training exercise his panic is real
trench slows down as he watches his friend struggling in vain
move on trench
enemy spear through his throat
the officers continue bayonets thrust forward leaving the struggling castelton behind
stables training ground westminster barracks day
the men are washing up after exercises dousing themselves with cold water
everyones teasing castelton except for trench
for once he keeps quiet knowing how hard his friends taking it
a seargent major enters and salutes
fifteen minutes in the briefing room
as he leaves the men look at each other curiously
briefing room westminster barracks day
the officers are assembled
harry durrance trench willoughby and castelton take their places on the wooden benches
as he sits harry notices a map of africa behind colonel hamilton
when the room settles down the st battalion grenadier guards have been ordered to forego their posting to india
off murmurs of surprise we ship out in three days to establish a forward garrison in the sudan
theres a buzz of excitement
colonel hamilton can hardly contain his smile
he turns to general holmby general holmby sir
general holmby a severe looking military man stands and faces the officers
their eyes are lit up with anticipation all except harry who stares ahead slowly turning inward
id like to apologise for not giving you men more notice
i know many of you will find it hard to see your families now
unfortunately we had no alternative
he turns to the map and points out the sudanese desert
general holmby three days ago an army of egyptian reserves led by general hicks was ambushed at tashgil by the mahdis forces
upoun attack the egyptians fled leaving general hicks and the british officers with him to fight a heroic but in the end hopeless rearguard action
all of them died sword in hand
harry stares out silently his whole world turned upside down
general holmby i hesitate to call this a mission of vengeance but the honour of our country is at stake
this government has finally seen fit to send its own troops to war
theres loud cheering from the men now regimental pride and bravado covering any trace of nerves
courtyard westinster barracks sunset
the officers pour out into the courtyard still exhilirated by the thought of seeing war
we hear trenchs voice rising above the others
trench i wish i had more than one life to give for my country
two would make me feel a lot safer
harry laughs with the others hiding his mounting anxiety
harry and durrances room barracks night
laughter filters into harry and durrances room
the two of them lie in their beds watching the embers die out in the fireplace
gazing up at the ceiling where the noise is coming from i listen to them laugh and i cant help wondering which ones wont be coming back
the worse part is i think i even know who they are
harry am i one
of course not harry
youre one of the lucky ones
always have been
harry picks up the reference to ethne but doesnt say anything
more laughter filters through
harry stares out in the darkness tormented
what are you thinking
harry hesitating im wondering what a godforesaken desert in the middle of nowhere has to do with her majesty the queen
hes on the colonels staff
harry i know what hell say its not for us to question
a beat do you ever ask yourself why youre going
not for the queen
i hardly know her
he smiles softly nor for the regiment
there isnt much of a military tradition in my family
a beat i suppose im going because youre going
you and trench and castelton and willoughby
a big grin not much of a reason i know but it reassures me
harry smiles but durrances words only make him feel more ashamed of the fear he feels inside
harry is there anything that frightens you jack
im frightened of not coming back in one piece
much more than dying
i wouldnt know what to do with myself in a wheel chair
and i couldnt stand to be pitied
he puts the thought out of his head and grins
theres a church near our house
next to the pub
every night at ten the drunks spill out shouting at the top of their voices
thats where i want to be buried
where i can hear them
harry nothings going to happen to you
its out of our hands anyway
might as well sleep easy
durrance rolls on his side
harry looks back at the fireplace as the last embers fade
regimental courtyard dawn
a cold blue light hangs over the barracks
the courtyard is empty except for a few sentries on duty
wagons pull in loaded with supplies
harry and durrances room barracks dawn
harry buttons his uniform
he looks as if he hasnt slept
he turns to durrance
his friend is still asleep
he wants to wake him up and talk but in the end he turns away and leaves the room
regimental courtyard dawn
harry walks slowly toward the regimental office
he glances up at the regimental flag flying beside the union jack
adcs rooms the regimental office dawn
willoughby looks up from his desk as harry walks in
willoughby grinning harry
youre up early
harry smiles awkwardly but doesnt say anything
willoughby senses somethings wrong
willoughby concerned whats the matter
harry looks at him for a moment but then turns to colonel hamiltons other aide de camp
id like to see the colonel please
willoughby stares in confusion
the aide de camp disappears into the next door office
harry still cant bring himself to look at his friend
willoughby harry whats wrong
hes interrupted as the aide de camp walks back in
the colonel will see you sir
harry thank you
harry walks into hamiltons office
willoughby stares after him bewildered
colonel hamiltons office day
colonel hamilton glances at the letter harry has just given him
he stops reading after only a few words
what the hell is this
my papers sir
i wish to resign my commission
colonel hamilton doesnt appear to understand
he looks back at the piece of paper as if hes misread something
if its leave you want theres a different procedure
normally i wouldnt consider it in the circumstances but given youve got engaged
interrupting politely i dont want any leave sir
i wish to resign my commission
a long silence
colonel hamilton calmly puts the letter aside and returns to his work ignoring harry
we all have them
sir ive made up my mind
and im asking you to reconsider
i have considered sir
and ive decided to leave the service
come back to me when youve discussed it with your father
its not his decision sir
hamilton explodes all his repressed fury pouring out
i do not accept these papers lieutenant and do not accept that one of my men the son of a man with whom i was honored to serve would walk
out on his regiment sir on the very eve were shipping off to war
holding out the papers take these back
i will not sir
harry i wish to resign my commission
hamilton stares at harry for what seems an eternity
hes struggling to make sense of something beyond his comprehension
slowly he gathers himself and lowers his eyes looking down at harrys papers very well
then as the coward and disgrace you are you may take yourself out of my office
signing harrys papers please leave the barracks at once
youre belongings will be sent on
face drained of color harry turns and leaves
adcs rooms the regimental office dawn
as the door opens willoughby stares at harry speechless
harry lowers his eyes and walks on
stairway barracks dawn
harry walks down the stairway gripping the bannisters
two soldiers salute him on their way up but he doesnt respond
regimental courtyard dawn
the supply wagons are being unloaded in the courtyard
harry walks between more soldiers his eyes fixed on the barrack gates
the only sound he hears in his head is the gentle flapping of a flag
trench and casteltons room barracks day
castelton is packing his trunk neat and fastidious taking his time over every item
trench waits for him impatiently
trench why cant you do this after breakfast
were not leaving till tonight
castelton ignores him folding his shirts
trench turns to durrance exasperated
trench he packs three bibles
can you believe it
he glances up as willoughby enters
field marshall willoughby
willoughby doesnt smile
he looks ashen faced
whats the matter
castelton and trench look up
willoughby its harry
he still cant believe it hes resigned
trench resigned what
willoughby snapping at trench his bloody commission
what do you think
theres a long silence
no one knows quite what to say
durrance finally speaks
what did hamilton do
refuse him leave
willoughby hamilton didnt do anything
harry went to see him of his own accord
right after they changed our deployment
castelton looks at trench as the insinuation sinks in
trench its just a coincidence
hes having second thoughts about leaving ethne
willoughby he was happy to leave her behind when we were going to india
no doubts then
jumping to harrys defence whats that supposed to mean
willoughby you tell me
he resigns his commission the very day were sent to war
harrys the best soldier in this regiment
willoughby obviously not when it counts
why dont you say that to his face
intervening we dont know the circumstances yet
reasoning with willoughby i think we should give harry a chance to explain
willoughby bitterly harrys gone
he left this morning
whilst you were all asleep
willoughby turns away in frustration
hes as upset as the others but he shows it in anger
trench and castelton look stunned
durrance stares ahead in silence
trench did he say anything to you jack
durrance remembers his conversation with harry the previous night
an action like this dishonors the entire regiment
suddenly venting his anger on willoughby will you forget about your bloody regiment for once
alright then it dishonours us
he stares at durrance with conviction
willoughby he was my friend too jack
a beat but a man who isnt prepared to give his life for his friends isnt a man at all
from the look on their faces its clear trench and castelton are beginning to agree with him
willoughby this has to be answered
durrance shakes his head refusing to turn on harry
he storms out of the room
train to bintree night
the whistle of a train
harry sits in a crowded carriage looking stiff in his civilian clothes
he glances out of the window but sees only his own reflection in the glass
ethnes carriage bintree day
ethne drives the carriage through the country lanes overjoyed to see harry
how many days leave have they given you
harry how many days would you like
they shouldnt have let you out of their sight
im going to kidnap you
harry i thought as much
this doesnt look like the way to your house
ethne laughs happily
harry cant quite bring himself to tell her yet
village church near ethnes home day
dappled light shines in the small stone church
ethne takes harry under the arm and walks him up the aisle
harry isnt this supposed to be bad luck
seeing me in the wedding dress is bad luck
this is practice
ethne looks towards the church benches as if shes greeting the guests
harry so im playing your father
you have to be a little less steady on your feet
hes had a few to drink
harry taking slow deliberate steps how is he
hell be thrilled to see you
ethne lets go of his hand as they reach the altar
she walks around him and takes his other hand as if hes the groom now
do you harry feversham harry skipping the rest you may kiss the bride
he tries to kiss her
laughing you cant jump ahead like that
you have to let me enjoy my wedding
its your fault the real one isnt for another year
harry hesitates finally seeing his opportunity
harry theres nothing to stop us getting married whenever we like ethne
ive handed in my papers
a long silence
ethne stares at him not sure shes understood
id been thinking about it for a while
why didnt you tell me
was it because of me
because of you
because of me
i couldnt see the point of continuing
the moment i fell in love with you my career in the army was over
i would have supported your career
my mother did the same for my father
its whats always been expected of me
harry i didnt think it was what you wanted
ethne still looks conflicted
it is my fault harry
i gave you the wrong impression
im really much more stoical than that
it wouldnt have been easy but id have coped
i love you far too much to let a year make a difference
harry it wasnt what i wanted for us
a hint of guilt as he hides the whole truth from her i love this place
i love you in this place
well help your father with the farm
well get it going again
well begin our lives together
ethne is silent moved by his words
harry all i want is for you to be happy
the smile slowly returns to her face i am happy harry
she rests her head in his arms again
as long as youre sure
harry of course im sure
he holds her close kissing her hair hiding his eyes from her
courtyard ethnes home bintree day dermods dogs leap on harry as he jumps off the carriage
you ought to train these beasts dermod
trained them to scare away prospective son in laws
harry and dermod hug each other already like father and son
a maid hands ethne some letters and a parcel as she enters the house
harry follows her up the stairs
which room do you want
harry the one with the connecting doors
you must have imagined that one
the guest room ethnes house
sunlight fills the room as harry throws open the blinds
he takes a long look at the fields outside
glancing through her letters i see youve moved in already
this ones addressed to you
she holds out the small parcel
harry walks over curiously
teasing him a secret admirer
harry teasing her back i wonder which one it is
ill open it thank you
she undoes the wrapping
theres a small white box underneath
she opens the lid
theres nothing inside except three white feathers pinned to three visiting cards
ethnes about to make a joke when she suddenly sees how pale harry looks
what is it
looking at the feathers again what does this mean
slowly that there are some things that cant be hidden
beginning to look worried i dont understand
harry these are feathers of cowardice
ethne laughs nervously
what a horrible joke
harry it isnt a joke ethne
they were sent in earnest
who sent them
her anger rising how dare they
harry reading the cards willoughby trench and castelton
you see it is a joke
theyre your friends
she looks to harry for confirmation
all he can say youre the most important thing to me
panicked by his tone why are you saying that to me now
what is it harry
harry we were told on tuesday night that the regiment would be shipping out to the sudan instead of india
that wed be seeing war within a week
i handed in my resignation the following morning
theres a long silence as ethne takes it in
like durrance she wont accept it
i dont believe thats why you resigned
you wouldnt have come to me like this
you wouldnt have been able to look me in the eye
harry stares at her guiltily tormented
the tears shining in her eyes i dont believe you
three white feathers and our world is at an end
it cant be that simple
and still he doesnt answer
you have to answer these charges
harry finally i cant
all my life ive been following a path thats filled me with dread
i kept going because of the people behind me and the people beside me but all i wanted to do was turn and run
i didnt even have the courage to do that until i met you
dont use me as an excuse
harry ethne pulling away from him this afternoon you told me you left the army because of me
or at least you made me believe it
tell me the truth
would you have resigned if we werent engaged
theres a long silence
these are the hardest words harrys ever had to speak
i would have resigned
i wouldnt have gone to war for anything
ethne stares at him a moment then removes her engagement ring from her finger and holds it out to him
ive no right to call you a coward but you are a liar
please take this back
harry takes the ring without protest
ethne turns and walks away
as she leaves she sets the feathers on the table and closes the door behind her
harry listens to her footsteps fade
he walks towards the table
as he looks down he sees four feathers
ethne has snapped the fourth from her fan
very carefully as if they were the most precious objects in the world harry gathers them his eyes shining with tears
a burst of noise and colour
rows of soldiers march by in perfect squares proudly wearing their regimental colours
the wharf is lined with people cheering and waving flags sending them off to inevitable victory
stable deck troop ship london docks night
we can still hear the roar of the crowd outside
castelton is trying to coax his horse into its box
trench and willoughby and durrance wait for him
trench come on castelton
give her a good kick
i want to wave to the ladies
wharf london docks night
the crowd below cheers as the soldiers crowd the rails
rails troop ship london docks night
trench waves at the crowd as if he were the queen
castelton is lost in the scale of it all
durrance stares at the tiny figures wondering if harrys amongst them
willoughby interrupting his thoughts jack i wanted to apologise for the other day
my argument wasnt with you
durrance keeps staring into the crowd below
wharf london docks night
harry stares up at the ship a ghost amongst the cheering faces
the soldiers at the rails look like specks but harry knows his friends are somewhere up there
officers stand wharf london docks night
a line of retired officers salute as the vessel finally sets off
amongst them is general feversham harrys father
he stands at attention
the celebrations over the crowd moves away from the docks
harry searches through the throng for his father
general feversham and colonel sutch wait in line for a hansom cab
the two old soldiers look frail in the falling rain
as theyre about to climb onto a carriage a voice calls out harry o
the general turns around
his eyes fill with emotion as his son approaches
i need to talk to you sir
theres a long silence as general feversham gazes at his son
harry looks as if he hasnt slept in days
his eyes are swollen and bloodshot full of heartbreak and shame
for a moment it seems as if the old man will take him in his arms and comfort him but instead he averts his eyes and climbs into the carriage
colonel sutch looks at harry regrettably as if to say theres nothing he can do
london streets night
newsboys follow harry home trying to sell him their newspapers refusing to take no for an answer
its a commemorative issue sir
war in the sudan
harry buys a paper just to be rid of him only for another newsboy to take his place
second newsboy different paper sir london times
the sound of guns echoes in the distance
harry looks up
his face is unshaven his eyes glassy from lack of sleep
another volley sounds outside
harry gets off the floor and walks over
as he does so we see the piles of newspapers that have gathered on his floor over the past few weeks
the regimental guns boom outside
harry opens the window
he wants to hear them more clearly
he wants to be reminded of his shame
he walks back to the days newspapers and kneels down amongst the mess
we see headlines of massacres and slaughters beneath them artists impressions of the mahdist atrocities
london streets day
the newsboys run from harry now mistaking him for a tramp
he catches up with one of them forcing some money on him
giving him a paper british defeat in the sudan
harry flicks through the newspaper anxiously
war office london day
crowds have gathered outside the war office
the mood has changed from celebration to panic
people are stunned by the news of defeat desperate to hear if their loved ones are alright
soldiers hold back the surging mass
only small groups are allowed in at a time
corridor war office building london day
harry hurries down the corridor towards an area where the names of british casualties have been pinned to a notice board
people swarm past him in the other direction
some of them look relieved others are overwhelmed by grief
harry hurries on his heart pounding
casualty list war office building london day
harry pushes through the crowd of peering heads
as he finally elbows his way to the front he glimpses the long list of casualties
his eyes look through the ds first
durrances name isnt there
no sign of castelton under the cs
harry is jostled backwards as he searches for the other names
with a fierce effort he gets to the front again
no trench under t no willoughby under w
theyre all safe
harrys body slackens with relief
harrys appartment block london street day
harry looks drained as he reaches the front door of his building
as he opens it his landlady walks out
landlady theres someone to see you sir
theyre waiting upstairs
harry doesnt wait for her to finish
stairway harrys appartment block london street day
harry bounds up the stairs expecting to see ethne
he stops suddenly as he sees colonel sutch instead waiting outside his door
he hides his disappointment with an awkward smile
harry colonel sutch
sutch cant help staring at harry shocked by the state hes in
harry tries to make the room look more presentable gathering up the newspapers and maps off the floor
he finally stops what hes doing and turns around
harry quietly how is he
hes been very withdrawn
ive tried to persuade him to leave the house but hes a stubborn man
harry will he see me
i dont think so
he pauses but if its money you need he wont cut you off
he hinted as much to me
harry i dont need money sir
harry turns away
sutch looks torn
as a soldier he disapproves of what harrys done but as a family friend he cant help feeling sorry for the boy
you were never cut out for this proffession
harry a thin smile was it that obvious
it was to me
ever since you were a child
i only wish id said something to your father
harry turns and faces him
harry with an almost morbid curiosity how did you know i didnt have it in me
what difference does it make
harry it does to me sir
its all i think about
what makes a man a coward
losing patience thats enough harry
get on a grip on yourself
youre no use to anyone sitting here all day driving yourself mad
the outburst seems to release sutch from his soldiers reserve
hes all concern now
whats done is done
harry quietly no sir it isnt
harry reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small white box
he opens it in front of sutch
there are four white feathers inside
sutch stares at the names on the cards
stunned who sent you the fourth
sutch looks up in surprise beginning to realise the full extent of harrys heartache
throw them away
they dont mean a thing
they do to me sir
theyre all i have left of my friends
harry this is morbid
harry i dont mean it that way
trying to make him understand you see if there was something i could do something so undeniable
im not saying it would change anything its too late for that
but if the feathers can be given then they can be taken back
harry your friends are in egypt
they transfer to suakin in a fortnight
sutch doesnt understand at first
then he looks at the newspapers and maps spread out across the floor and begins to see the method in harrys madness
in disbelief youre a civilian
even if you find them theres nothing you can do
harry im well aware of my chances
then whats the point
staring at him in dismay you think ethne will take you back
is that what you think
from the look in his eyes its clear the thought had entered his head
sutchs words bring him back down to earth
his voice is quieter now resigned
harry i dont have any choice
with a terrible honesty im not sure how much longer i can live with myself here like this
colonel sutch stares at him with pity seeing the depth of his anguish
harry im leaving for egypt tomorrow
he realises theres no point trying to dissuade him do you want me to tell your father
harry only if something should happen to me
ill write and let you know how i am as often as i can
what about ethne
harry has to think long and hard about this
the thought of her fills him with sadness
harry id rather you didnt tell her anything
after all ive put her through the least i can do is let her forget me in peace
colonel sutch looks moved by his predicament and impressed by these first grasping signs of nobility
harry maybe ill come back sooner than i think hear the guns booming off the african coast and take the first ship home
i doubt it harry
colonel sutch smiles weakly
view of the african coast day
through the shimmering heat we see the outlines of the african mountains an arid moonscape dust clouds blowing in the wind
port of alexandria day
the same veil of dust blows through the crowded port
harry covers his eyes
his hair is longer now his face gaunt and bearded
clutching his suitcase he moves through the throng
streets of alexandria day
the alleyways look almost dreamlike through the shimmering heat
its as if were in harrys head reflecting his state of mind
a crowd of urchin boys are following his every step imitating his langorous walk
harry doesnt notice them
his gaze is riveted by the sights around him the merchants beckoning him into their shops the british soldiers on leave sheltering in the cool hollows of the cafes and
whorehouses the beggars hunched up against the stone walls their faces covered with flies
through the arches of the souk a wedding procession appears
the bride and groom sit on brightly painted donkeys
all around them women and children clap and shrill
harry catches a glimpse of the brides face
she gazes at him for a moment then looks away
the colours of the souk give way to the cool white emptiness of a colonial hotel
english guests talk in hushed whispers as egyptian waiters serve them tea
harry sits in a corner of the lobby nursing his drink observing a group of english officers laughing amongst themselves
harry looks thoughtful wondering how to approach them
suddenly he hears a commotion
a drunk british corporal is escorted out of the hotel by a group of senior officers
he shouts and swears but they ignore him throwing him out of the door
harry gets up as he sees his chance
egyptian bar brothel bazaar alexandria night
the rhythmic beating of drums
tattooed women dance on a makeshift stage mesmerising the crowd of eager soldiers
harry sits with the drunken british corporal
the mans eyes keep drifting longingly towards the stage as if he hasnt seen a woman in months
harry fills his glass
resuming their conversation its all reconnaisance trips
the rivers too swollen to move troops in numbers
her majestys armys rotting in suakin
harry which other regiments were with you
theyre all there the hussars the highlanders the grenadiers
which newspaper did you say you were from
harry the london times
you must think im a disgrace
thats what those officers called me
harry how much longer do you think the troops will be held up in suakin
as long as they can if theyre lucky
he finishes his drink does the prime minister read your paper
harry i imagine so
then tell him from me were on a losing wicket here
these bastards arent scared of anything
if they saw death walking down the street theyd hide in an alleyway and try to pick him off with a stone
how do you fight people like that
he tries to drain the last few drops from his empty glass then looks over longingly at the tattooed dancers
sand storm desert near suakin sudan day
thick gusts of sand blow at us
as the swirling clouds settle we see a group of misshapen figures huddled together
as they finally rise and start to move we realise theyre british soldiers on camels
amongst the dust caked faces we see trench castelton willoughby and durrance
desert near suakin sudan day
the sand storm has cleared and in its place a harsh desert sun beats down
the column of british scouts trudges forward
durrance rides at the front looking as if he were born here eyes alert to every shimmer and nuance
up ahead he sees a large mound of stones standing out amongst the mud flat
he drives his camel forward
as he approaches he sees that its a dervish burial mound
skulls and skeletons are splayed across the rocks
willoughby rides up through the ranks and joins him
what do you think
i think theyre trying to frighten us off
we should keep pressing forward
willoughby offers durrance his water flask
durrance takes a drink
pulling a face its bloody whisky
willoughby grinning my camel drinks the water
burnt out fortress desert day
as the camels tread their way through the sun baked shingles a ghostly fortress appears on the horizon
the men start loading their rifles instinctively
courtyard burnt out fortress desert day
all thats left of the fortress is a grim skeleton
the union jack lies ripped to shreds halfway down its flagpole
the british soldiers gaze at the destruction
their camels sense their tension and rear a little in the eerie silence
as ever trench is the first to break the ice
trench jumping off his camel walking towards the fortress well i dont know about you lot but im going to grab a drink before mustapha does
mustapha the camel whinnies as if hes understood every word
the men start laughing
the waters probably poisoned
trench leading his camel towards the well instead mustapha be my guest
theres more laughter
durrance smiles but his eyes are still alert
above the fortress tower he sees a flock of birds taking flight rising up gracefully towards the desert sun
suddenly amidst the laughter and chatter one of the soldiers topples off his camel
his friends laugh friends capshaw you dosy bastard
camillas tired him out
capshaw doesnt move
casteltons the first to realise somethings wrong
he jumps off his camel and turns capshaw over
half the soldiers face has been blown off
raw bone glistens underneath
castelton rears back in horror
the soldiers leap off their camels using them as shields
the snipers bullet rings out and sends one of the animals crashing to the dirt
the men start to run now seeking shelter in the surrounding hutments
the snipers gun rings out repeatedly
hutment burnt out fortress desert day
durrance and castelton duck into the hutment
keep him pinned
hes up in the tower
castelton unleashes a volley of shots
durrance moves quickly to the other side of the hutment and climbs out of the window
courtyard burnt out fortress desert day
the camels circle around themselves in panic
trench weaves his way between the rearing animals protecting himself from the sniper
a shot rings out and spits dust in his face
trench whispering in anger you bastard
outer perimeter burnt out fortress desert day
durrance runs around the back of the fortress breathing hard
courtyard burnt out fortress desert day
a second shot spins trench round grazing him in the arm
trench his voice rising you bastard
a third shot narrowly misses
trench is up and running now not waiting for the fourth
trench shouting like a madman as he charges towards the hutment you bastard
outer perimeter burnt out fortress desert day
durrance has a clear view on the snipers tower now
from below he can see the mans rifle edge out fire and then withdraw
durrance heads quietly towards the tower stairs
stairs snipers tower burnt out fortress day
several of the steps are missing from the rickety stairway
durrance climbs over them as lightly as he can
up above he can hear the snipers rifle ringing out
casteltons hutment burnt out fortress desert day
castelton fires another round at the snipers tower
trench sits on the floor cursing as he bandages his grazed arm
snipers tower burnt out fortress day
durrance raises his head cautiously
at the tower window he sees the dervish sniper firing his rifle
he could kill the man easily but it would mean shooting him in the back
he cant bring himself to do it drop it
the dervish sniper stops still
he turns around slowly and looks durrance in the eye
a contemptuous smile flickers across his face
very slowly he takes a bullet from his pocket and slips it in the rifle
he doesnt even look at durrance
theres a terrifying suicidal calm about him
durrance studies his enemy admiring his utter contempt for death and then fires two bullets into his head
tents the british camp suakin sudan night
bonfires flicker across the british camp
durrance sits outside his tent bathed in firelight watching some bedu dancers performing for the british troops
he seems far away as if hes thinking about the days kill
trenchs braying voice snaps him out of his reverie
trench showing off his wound look at this beauty
trench sits down between durrance castelton and willoughby
trench playful its true what they say
you havent lived until youve been shot
its only a scratch
trench you wouldnt understand
you havent looked into the abyss
shut up trench
durrance joins in the laughter but he still seems far away
willoughby noticing are you alright jack
smiling couldnt be better
willoughby sees the haunted look in his eyes but doesnt say anything
a seargent major interrupts
sergeant major lieutenant durrance colonel hamilton would like to see you in his tent sir
trench poor willoughby theyve passed you over
willoughby grabs a handful of sand and throws it at trench
durrance gets up to see what hamilton wants
colonel hamiltons tent british camp suakin night
colonel hamilton sits at a fold up table eating his dinner by candlelight
he turns around as durrance walks in
he wipes his face with his knapkin and gestures for durrance to sit
congratulations it seems you had another successful day
too honest to accept the complement we killed one dervish sniper sir
im giving you three weeks leave
durrance looks surprised
i really dont need or deserve any leave
you certainly deserve it every report i receive singles you out for praise
with your permission id like to stay here with the rest of the regiment
durrance is too disciplined a soldier to protest
anyway the rest of the regiment is stuck here in suakin until the government agrees to send us to khartoum
containing his frustration you and several other officers will be going to london to convince parliament and more importantly public opinion that it is necessary to pursue this campaign with
the utmost vigour
do you have any questions
yes sir why me
then almost mischievously because youre a hero
with all due respect sir i dont think weve been fighting long enough to have any heroes in this campaign
thats my point
its all about perception
durrance sees theres no point discussing it further
he salutes and turns to leave
a question lieutenant
what is it you like about this place
durrance chooses his words carefully
the freedom sir
the fact that one is reduced to what one really is
colonel hamilton smiles softly wondering if durrance is insulting him not giving a damn
desert between egypt and sudan day
a searing white sun hangs over the desert
somewhere amidst the rolling dunes and floating dust we see a caravan of camels winding its way through the plateau
caravan desert between egypt and sudan day
harry rides at the front of the caravan with gustave a sun blackened french slave driver
behind them ride saadi his dinka assistant and three beautiful dinka slavegirls
gustave the british soldiers rent my girls off me for three dhirrams an hour
well worth the trip to suakin
harry smiles distractedly
his eyes are fixed on the majestic landscape before him miles and miles of rolling desert
gustave recognising the first time awe one feels for the desert dont fall in love too quickly
nothing turns on you like the sand
he looks back at the dinka slavegirls who are whispering amongst themselves
gustave shut up
to saadi keep them quiet
what do i pay you for
saadi says something to the slavegirls in their native dinka tongue
from the deference in his voice its clear the women are from a higher caste than him
desert between egypt and sudan day
a breeze blows sand drifts across the desert floor
as a veil of dust clears harry sees the bones of a camel forming a perfect skeleton on the floor
gustave bones are a good sign
we must be near a well
well desert between egypt and sudan day
the skeletons lie thick around the well six or seven men in bedu robes sprawled within yards of the precious water
gustave as harry stares at the bones what else is there to fight for in a desert
at least it makes sense of war
saadi hoists some water up in a goatskin canteen
he offers the canteen to gustave
the french slave driver is about to take a drink when he hears one of the dinka slavegirls murmuring in her native tongue
he wheels his camel around angrily
gustave to saadi what did she say
before saadi can make an excuse for her the dinka slavegirl starts cursing in her native tongue her eyes fixed on gustave
gustave lashes out with his whip
the slavegirls camel rears throwing her to the floor
gustave rides towards her raising his whip ready to beat her
harrys camel suddenly lurches between them
at first it looks like hes lost control of the animal but as he steadies his mount it becomes clear hes put himself in gustaves way
with inch perfect skill he starts to circle harry trying to get a clear view of the girl
with equal skill harry twists his own camel round keeping her blocked from him at every turn
gustave grows impatient
he raises his whip threatening harry
harry doesnt flinch
his eyes are fixed on gustave the whole time
finally gustave backs down intimidated by the mysterious stranger
he stares at harry half in anger half in admiration
gustave you ride well
with that he rides his camel back to the well
the dinka slavegirl doesnt look at harry
shes too proud to acknowledge his help
cave desert between egypt and sudan night
a howling sandstorm blows outside the cave
the camels screech in the night terrified by the wind
saadi and the dinka girls shelter in the furthest corner of the cave
harry and gustave sit by a flickering fire
gustave whats your secret
anyone who talks as little as you do must be hiding something
did you kill a man
harry prods the fire ignoring him
gustave turns around as he hears saadi and one of the dinka girls whispering
gustave taiser vouz
gustave turns back to harry looking pleased with himself
gustave you have to break them
for their own good
theyll only be happy again when they forget what its like to be free
he looks at harry mischievously its like a man whos been thrown over by a woman
at first hes defiant then hes determined but finally he longs to forget
harry gets up and walks to the other side of the cave
he hears gustave chuckling behind him
gustave any secrets you have the desert will find you out
pass cliffs desert between egypt and sudan night
a screaming gale howls through the desert pass
cave desert between egypt and sudan night
it isnt the storm that wakes harry up but the sound of whispering
gustave is snoring by the fire
harry looks past him
he sees saadi and the dinka slavegirl he rescued earlier lying in each others arms making love as quietly as they can
harry cant help staring
their act seems to represent the ultimate defiance he ultimate affirmation of their freedom
he feels a spark of hope in their hope
saadi and the dinka slavegirl finally come to rest in each others arms
harry listens as they continue to whisper in their native tongue
hes about to close his eyes when suddenly the dinka slavegirl gets up
harry watches curiously as she walks across the cave
she picks something off the floor
as she walks towards gustave harry suddenly sees that its a sharp jagged rock
before harry can say anything the girl falls to her knees and buries the rock deep into gustaves face
almost simultaneously harry feels a sharp crack on the back of his head
he rolls away instinctively but to no avail
the blows rain down
as he tries to protect his face harry sees saadi holding a thick wooden club over him
the club hammers down splitting harrys fingers tearing into his face knocking any resistance out of him
as he stares up listlessly harry sees saadi standing over him ready to finish him off
suddenly a voice rings out a womans voice calling saadi off
harrys eyes drift away
army navy club london day
we see ethnes face now staring out
for a moment we think shes part of harrys dream but then the familiar noises of reality fade in and we realise shes amongst a crowd of officers and journalists
listening to durrance lecturing about the sudan aware shes in the audience each moment we delay we imperil general gordons life
the mahdi is concentrating all his forces on khartoum
at most the garrison can hold out for a few more weeks
army navy club london day
durrance stands at the club entrance with ethne and her friend caroline adair
caroline read about your lecture in the times
were both very proud of you
im glad you came
durrance tries not to stare at ethne too hard
we have to be somewhere this afternoon but if youre free this evening lieutenant durrance
im afraid i have to give another talk
suddenly would you mind if i didnt come with you caroline
i dont know the gilbys all that well
we see the reluctance in her eyes but shes far too dignified to show it
you can do whatever you like darling
london street day
durrance and ethne walk along a crowded street
passing women glance admiringly at durrance in his uniform
thats six ive counted
six married women gawping at you
durrance smiles shyly wondering if shes flirting with him
tea shop london day
a tinkle of china and cutlery
ethne and durrance sit in a tea shop
ethne cant help sending up the place
she dabs her lips with her napkin pretending to be all prim and proper
do you want to go somewhere else
no its lovely here
durrance looks out of place in the surroundings and nervous around ethne
trying to put him at ease i want to hear all about the desert
she leans towards him like a child waiting to hear a tale
durrance isnt sure if shes aware of the effect on him
it grows on you
theres something about all that emptiness that concentrates the mind
looking into his eyes on what
he hesitates you spend a lot of time thinking about the people you miss especially at night you have the most vivid dreams its hard to believe theyre not real
he stops as he sees the sadness in her eyes reminded of the barrier between them
have you heard from harry
a beat no
i went to see general feversham
he refused to discuss it with me
i know they had a falling out
she tries to sound casual but durrance feels how much the thought of harry still pains her
testing her almost in spite of himself hes one of the people i think about all the time
very deliberately i dont as much as i used to
looking up at durrance i certainly wasnt until you brought him up
theres a touch of reproach in her eyes but also something flirtatious
its as if shes forcing herself to put durrance above harry in her thoughts
when do you go back
durrance isnt sure how to read her disappointment
he feels conflicted about harry but he cant help being drawn to her
awkwardly are you sure i cant persuade you to stay in london a few more days
listen to more of my boring lectures
i thought the talk was fascinating
steeling himself i really would like to see you again before i leave
theres something touching about durrances shyness a contradiction between the fearless warrior and the tentative lover
ethne feels torn but she wills herself on lightly but acknowledging his invitation nevertheless you could always visit us in bintree
she feels her eyes drifting away from him but she forces herself to look back and holds his gaze
cave desert between egypt and sudan day
harry opens his eyes painfully
his face is still battered and swollen from saadis beating
as he picks himself up he sees gustaves body lying exactly where the dinka slavegirl killed him the jagged rock still embedded in his face
harry looks away as he hears a camel whinnying outside
cave desert between egypt and sudan day
the camel is tied by some rope to a jutting rock a goatskin canteen slung over its back
harry realises the dinka girl he rescued has left them for him
he looks over the horizon
theres no sign of the dinkas only the vast desert waste
dunes desert between egypt and sudan day
harry urges his camel up the steep slope of a crescent dune
his battered face is burnt raw by the sun his skin covered in blisters
he looks out hopefully as his camel finally conquers the sandy peak but all he sees in its place are miles and miles of rolling dunes
water trough desert between egypt and sudan day
harrys camel noses its way into a shallow water trough
harry almost drops off the animal in his haste to drink
he digs his hands into the mud and cups some of the precious liquid in his palms
its only after hes drunk that he realises there are dozens of tics stuck to his arms and face
desert between egypt and sudan night
harry shivers in the cold night air partly from the wind but also from the fever hes caught off the tics
hands trembling he burns the blood gorged insects off his arm with a glowing stick from the camp fire
shingles desert between egypt and sudan day
harrys camel rears as it treads over the searing shingles
he topples off
eyes half shut he grabs the reins making sure the camel doesnt run off
he takes a knife from his pocket
harry im sorry im sorry
he cuts a slash in the camels hide and puts his mouth to it
he sucks up what little blood he can and rolls the liquid around his mouth
desert between egypt and sudan night
harry talks to himself in the dark
his face is all puffed up with fever his hair chalked with dust
above him the stars glimmer promising another day of relentless sun
desert hills desert between egypt and sudan day
harry lies unconscious on the camels back roped to the animal
the camel noses its way through the desert floor coming across a few shrubs
it tears them out of the earth and starts up the hill in search of more nourishment
harry slides precariously down the camels back
only the ropes hold him tight
as the camel finally reaches the top we see a vast plateau open up before us
the earth is still desert brown but there are patches of green now and somewhere in the distance the sky is blackening with rain
streets of suakin sudan night
a torrential downpour floods the narrow streets of suakin
a group of excited beggar boys lead harry and his camel through the rain swept alleyways
local hotel suakin sudan night
harry lies shivering on a bunk bed overwhelmed by fever
an arab doctor treats his ravaged skin with balm
behind them the beggar boys argue with the arab hotelier demanding more money for bringing the foreigner here
harry shakes his head no
marketplace streets of suakin sudan day
sunlight dries out the previous nights storm
harry wanders through the marketplace wearing long bedu robes now limping from his desert ordeal
passersby pull away as they see his face mistaking the open blisters for leprosy
riverbank near the british camp suakin sudan day
a crocodile rears out of the water and tears a lump of meat off a hook
it disappears back under the surface avoiding the trap
theres a cry of disappointment from the riverbank
a group of local children are trying to catch the beast
trench is their leader
castelton smiles at his friends antics
trench dont give up lads
give the old porker another whack
the boys have tied a pig to a stake outside the water
they beat it with a paddle until it whines
hearing the noise the crocodile rears its head and sweeps towards the remaining lump of meat on the hook
trench and the boys swarm around the river expectantly
in their excitement they fail to notice the shrouded figure watching them from the distance
its harry hidden beneath his bedu robes
he gazes at his two friends longingly
finally one of the boys sees him and thinking hes a leper starts throwing stones sudanese boy imshi imshi
the other boys join in yelling insults
trench and castelton pay no attention
they have no idea who it is
harry steps back slowly the pebbles landing at his feet still gazing at his friends
he knows he doesnt have the courage to face them yet that its too soon
hamiltons tent british camp suakin sudan night
colonel hamiltons tent is lit in torchlight
dozens of officers mill about celebrating their orders to march on khartoum
its hard to imagine anyone changing the prime ministers mind
even he reads the papers
they told him if he didnt send us to khartoum hed be indicted for murder
theres laughter all around
across the tent durrance stands on his own feeling out of place
willoughby arrives with two drinks
willoughby youre quite the hero tonight
the colonel seems to be taking a fair bit of credit
they smile as they watch colonel hamilton holding forth
willoughby so you had a good time in london
better than i thought
willoughby trying to make it sound casual did you look up harry
hesitating nobody knows where he is
willoughby not even ethne
a little put out why should she
shes broken off their engagement
willoughby notices the edge in his voice but doesnt say anything
durrance feels a touch of guilt surprised by his own jealous reaction
harrys room local hotel suakin sudan night
harry studies his face in the mirror his blisters have dried into tough leathery skin his eyes are hollow from recent hardships
he whispers to himself in broken arabic and dips his fingers into a dark mud like substance
he applies it to his hair his beard and his teeth
coolies british camp suakin day
long lines of desert africans have gathered outside the british camp looking for work as coolies
there are nuers dinkas somalis ethiopians all of them wearing different clothes and speaking different languages
somewhere amongst them we see harry disguised in his bedu robes
hes being examined by a british seargent major and an egyptian orderly
tell him to remove his shirt
harry waits for the orderly to translate before he opens his robes
his body is lean and tanned and scarred
impressed by his physique this ones been in the wars
let me see his teeth
again harry waits for the arabic translation before he opens his mouth
put him on the boats
harry is ushered off
as he walks away he hears an argument start up behind him
the egyptian orderly is protesting to the seargent major about hiring a fierce looking nubian warrior
this man comes from a race of slaves
they have blood feuds with everyone
if you arm him it will mean trouble
none of the egyptian soldiers will serve with him
the nubian stares ahead in silence expressionless
alright put him on the boats
the nubian falls into line behind harry
drill area british camp suakin day
willoughby barks orders at the egyptian reserves drilling them before departure
durrance trench and castelton walk out of their tent imitating him
coolies british camp suakin day
harry watches his friends from afar
he sits amongst the coolies holding out his soup bowl waiting to be fed
the nubian squats opposite him
harry cant help staring at the long white ostrich feather in his hair
the egyptian orderly arrives and pours a rancid looking gruel in harrys bowl
he turns to the nubian
in arabic is this good enough for you slave
the nubian ignores him
the orderly spits in the gruel before handing it to him
the nubian takes it and calmly downs it in one
the orderly moves on in disgust
the nubian looks at harry
harry braces himself and swallows the stew
cataracts of the nile sudan day
a heavy current rushes through the waters of the nile
the cataracts are full of treachorous rocks jutting out in all shapes and sizes
harry is force marched with the other coolies prodded on by the egyptian overseers
they drag the british supply boats through the cataract by hand pulling on huge hemp ropes
in front of harry the nubian is being singled out for punishment
the egyptian orderly lashes him repeatedly
the nubian keeps pulling ignoring the stinging pain
he looks back at the orderly as if to say is that all youve got
supply boat cataracts of the nile sudan day
a supply boat rushes down a steep incline in the river
trench yells at the top of his voice as the spray hits his face
castelton stands beside him staring at the banks of the nile watching the hundreds of coolies dragging their boat through the cataracts
coolie camp cataracts of the nile sudan night
drum beats fill the night sky
the reflection of the coolies camp fires glistens over the black water
some are singing others praying but most lie fast asleep
harry sits on his own warming himself by a fire his body wracked with pain
as he reflects he hears the gentle tread of feet
he looks up to see the nubian staring at him
the man squats down beside his campfire without asking
nubian abou fatma in english my name is abou fatma
harry shaking his head as if he doesnt understand bedu
i was a scout for general hicks
harry arabi abu fatma suddenly launches into a flurry of fluent arabic
harry stares at him in silence unable to respond
there are many in this camp who would serve the mahdi
when they find out there is a british spy amongst them watching them they will kill him
quietly mocking it wont be long bedu
he turns to leave
harry hesitates then harry shoukran
correcting his arabic shoukhran
their eyes stay on each other a moment
harry finally speaking in english why do you warn me
harry i cant pay you
i cant help you
he gazes at the mercenariess powerful features and the long white feather in his hair
harry whats the feather for
the first time i killed a man
pointing to a feather earring in his left ear five men
and an ivory bracelet on his wrist ten men
he takes a beaded necklace out of his pocket this i will wear soon
im a good soldier
i will protect you
harry stares at him a moment then takes out a small box from his pocket
he shows abou fatma the four white feathers inside
abou fatma looks at them unaware of the irony in harrys gesture thinking hes saying he doesnt need help
gesturing to the welts on harrys body underneath the flesh is white and weak
even if the mahdis men dont find you out the whips will
harry ill pay you one shilling a day
abou fatma gets up and walks away
harry cant help smiling as he stares after him
coolie camp cataracts of the nile sudan day
screams of agony fill the air
the egyptian orderly lies in a pool of blood his belly sliced open holding his guts in his hands
harry stands amongst the gathered crowd watching horrified as a british officer kneels beside the dying man
who did this to you
who did this
the egyptian orderly tries to speak but all that comes out of his mouth is a froth of blood
his tongue has been cut out
harry looks around the crowd until he sees abou fatma
the nubians eyes are expressionless
around his neck he wears the beaded necklace now
cataracts of the nile sudan day
the white sails of the british supply boats float through the hazy water
on the riverbank harry and the hundreds of other coolies drag them along
the overseers glance at abou fatma warily but none of them dare raise a whip to him now
durrances tent british camp cataracts day
we can still hear the noise of the coolies outside
durrance sits at a table writing a letter
we glimpse the words dearest ethne
he stops as he hears a commotion outside
british camp cataracts day
durrance walks out of the tent
in the distance he sees a handful of ragged looking british officers being helped off their camels
as he stares more closely durrance notices that many of them have terrible wounds
those that can still walk are lead off to the commanders tent
general wolseys tent british camp cataracts day
general wolsey and colonel hamilton are bent over a map of the nile discussing their progress with their aide de camps
willoughby looks up as he hears the wounded officers being led into the tent
he stops as he sees the terrible state theyre in
even wolsey and hamilton look shocked
slowly rising saluting what is it
a letter sir
from general gordon
willoughby notices one of the wounded officers has tears in his eyes
what happened to you
we were ambushed sir
more than half our company were killed
see that these men are tended to
the wounded officers are led out
willoughby like all the other aide de camps looks dazed
general wolsey opens general gordons letter and reads in silence
finally looking up at colonel hamilton gordon says he can only hold out for forty more days
it took eleven for these men to get here
british camp cataracts night
durrance willoughby castelton and trench sit around a camp fire trying to ignore the hideous cries of the wounded british soldiers coming from the hospital tent
willoughby recounting what hes heard wolseys going to split the force
a river columns going to continue down the nile whilst a desert column joins up with regiment at abou clea and makes a dash for khartoum
the piercing screams start up again
trench dont tell me weve drawn the short straw
british camp cataracts day
silence hangs over the british camp
the coolies are lined up under the scorching sun
the egyptian overseers walk past them selecting some for the desert march others for the river march
harry stands next to abou fatma
across the camp he can see durrance trench castelton and willoughby preparing their camels for the overland trek
harry whispering to abou fatma i need to travel with the desert detachment
the egyptian overseer finally reaches them
to abou fatma in arabic well keep you on the river
a calm menacing look in his eyes with you
the egyptian overseer hesitates remembering what happened to his friend gesturing to the desert column instead over there
harry falls into line behind abou fatma
the egyptian overseer doesnt seem to care
hes too relieved to be rid of the nubian
desert column british camp cataracts day
the desert column has assembled fourteen hundred strong
sergeant at arms column
durrance trench castelton and willoughby ride off at the head of the column
behind them the coolies carry heavy loads harry and abou fatma bringing up the rear
desert lanscape sudan day
a region of jutting cliffs and giant rock formations
the desert column rides through a narrow pass
durrances eyes are fixed on the ridges above them any one of which could be hiding a dervish sniper or scout
at the back of the column harrys equally alert
he looks across the cliff walls
suddenly he notices one of the coolies in front of him listening intently to a high pitched whine coming from a nearby gorge
harry studies the man
hes a powerfully built nuer tribesman yellow streaks running down his long black hair
every time he hears the distinctive noise he looks up concentrating
harry edges closer to abou fatma harry indicating the whining do you recognise that sound
harry doesnt look convinced
he stares at the nuer tribesman walking ahead of them glancing up from his heavy load every time he hears the distinctive cry
open desert sudan day
the wind blows gusts of sand into the camels eyes
durrance stares through the shimmering heatwaves
theres a sandstorm coming
colonel hamilton looks at the clear blue sky seeing nothing to indicate a storm but trusting durrances instincts
desert camp night
harry and the other coolies gather sticks and desert shrubs building a makeshift wall around the camp
the wind has picked up blowing thick gusts of sand in their faces
as they work in the darkness and the dust harry hears the whining sound he heard earlier
its quieter now but closer
abou fatma hears it too
harry its coming from inside the camp
they look around but the dust obscures everything
the whining starts up again
harry concentrates until he thinks he knows where its coming from
he checks to make sure the orderlies arent watching them and then signals for abou fatma to follow him
edge of the desert camp night
through the drifting clouds of sand we see a figure crouching near the camp perimeter
its the nuer tribesman harry noticed earlier
every time the wind picks up he calls out to the surrounding cliffs in a high piched whine
harry and abou fatma watch him from behind a wagon
abou fatma draws a knife from his boot
harry we need to find out who hes signalling
abou fatma replaces the knife reluctantly and points to a makeshift corrall where the camels are gathered
tent desert camp night
the tent flaps blow in the storm
trench castelton and willoughby shelter inside sharing a bottle of whisky
durrance sits apart from the others reading a letter
trench is that the same letter you read over and over again or do you get a different one each day
he cant help a smile its the same one but its twenty pages long
willoughby he writes them to himself
go on jack read us a line
read your own
trench dont be so coy youre amongst friends
grins all around
durrance looks at letter and tempts them with a single line
i often think about our walks by the river
he stops enigmatically to a chorus of protest trench more more
durrance hesitates reluctant to break the confidence of a letter but anxious to broach the subject with his friends
reading more quietly
your letter surprised and delighted me
if i appear indecisive its because im thinking of both of us
in the meantime i hope the length of my reply gives you some assurance of how very much i care about you
durrance lowers the letter and looks at his friends
trench so whos the lucky lady
after a moment ethne
ive asked her to marry me
you probably gathered that from the letter
theres a long silence
then suddenly trench raises his glass and roars
willoughby thats fantastic jack
she hasnt said yes
trench of course she will i hope the length of this reply gives you some idea of how much i bloody love you
how much i care about you
trench same thing
trench fills his glass to the brim
durrance laughs relieved that his friends have taken it so well
its only as he drinks that he catches a hint of disapproval in casteltons eyes
castelton raises his glass trying to hide his feelings but durrance sees through him
the moment is interrupted by loud shouting outside british corporal o s somethings up with the camels
castelton looks relieved to leave the tent worried that his conflicting emotions will betray him
durrance stares after him not entirely free of the memory of harry himself
desert camp night
castelton follows the corporal through the windswept camp
up ahead they can hear the camels screeching
castelton covers his eyes from the dust
suddenly he sees the silhouettes of two riders charging out of the corral
one of them stops and stares at him momentarily
he cant see the mans face clearly but his outline seems hauntingly familiar harry
the rider turns and charges out of the camp
the corporal blows a whistle reaching for his gun firing after them
castelton stares at the disappearing figures wondering if what he saw was real or a figment of his troubled conscience
hills above the desert camp night
harry and abou fatma ride up a steep hill shots ringing out behind them
ridge above the desert camp night
as the sands sweep past we see the mahdis scouts for the first time four nuer tribesmen standing on a ridge looking down on the british campfires below
as they hear the shots they turn away from the cliffside and mount their camels
view from a cliff desert day
the sand storm is still blowing obscuring the sun
in the distance the tiny figures of the nuer scouts can be seen riding across the arid sandscape
harry and abou fatma watch them from the cliffs and set off in pursuit
ridge view on nuers campfire desert night
the nuers camp fire glows far below on the valley floor
harry and abou fatma have built their own fire in a crevice on the cliff wall hidden from view
harrys eyes are fixed on the nuer scouts abou fatmas are fixed on him
why would a british spy be hiding from his own people
harry looks up at the nubian realising he cant keep up the pretence any longer
harry because im not a spy
youre a deserter
harry a long pause something like that
i was sent to fight and i ran away
abou fatma considers this for a moment
all soldiers run away
only the good ones return
harry looks away
down below the nuers camp fire goes out
open desert night
the moonlight colors the dunes in blues and greens
harry and abou fatma follow the nuers tracks through the virgin sands
crest of a hill open desert day
the sunrise casts a blood red light over the horizon
the four nuer scouts appear on the crest of a hill
we see them clearly now their long black hair streaked yellow their faces painted ghostly white
they survey the land beneath them and gallop off
the same hill desert day
abou fatma and harry walk their camels quietly up the hill following the nuers hoofprints
as they reach the top of the dune a vast plateau opens up beneath them
they see the nuer scouts riding along a winding trade route
at the end of the desert road stands a huge fortress
that is abou clea
a british fort
harry stares after the nuer scouts wondering why theyre heading back into a british stronghold
the four riders merge into one of the caravans that dot the landscape
caravan trade route to abou clea day
a long line of dinka refugees walk alongside one of caravans begging for food
harry and abou fatma ride near the back their faces hidden by their djellabas
fortress of abou clea night
a village of tents has spread around the fortress walls
more starving refugees clamour at the gates
harry gazes up at the garrison walls
british sentries can be glimpsed high up
the fortress gates creak open to let the caravan through
harry lowers his eyes as he rides past the guards
courtyard fortress of abou clea night
as he looks up again harry suddenly feels a rush of panic
the fortress courtyard is filled with dervish warriors
there are no british faces anywhere
harry glimpses a familiar red uniform but as he stares more closely his relief turns to horror
the british uniform is stained with blood
wearing it is a fierce looking dervish warrior with long braided hair
harry looks back at the ramparts
all the soldiers he thought were british sentries are in fact dervish warriors wearing the bloody uniforms of their victims
as he turns around harry sees the worst sight of all
hanging from scaffolds are the chalk white bodies of the real british soldiers
harry is shaken out of his horror by a sharp hissing sound
abou fatma glares at him to keep calm
dervish warriors grab hold of their camels and lead them with the rest of the caravan towards the stables
stables fortress of abou clea night
harry and abou fatma tether their camels
behind them the dervish warriors unload the caravans shipment of rifles
whispering to harry follow me out
harry nods still in shock
abou fatma turns around and heads out of the stables unchallenged
courtyard fortress of abou clea night
harry follows abou fatma through the crowded courtyard
his eyes are drawn to the torchlit faces all around him
the mahdis army is made up of dozens of different tribes some in glowing war paint others marked with ritual scars wearing the dried viscera of their victims around their
the dervishes eyes seem to follow harry wherever he goes staring out at him through their slit djellabas
suddenly harry feels a pair of hands grab him
he wheels around to see a huge dervish captain towering over him
in arabic studying harrys features come with me
in arabic our caravan is waiting outside
waving abou fatma away imshi
abou fatma murmurs something to harry in his native nubian tongue slipping in the english words ill find you
to harry in arabic follow me
gallows courtyard fortress of abou clea night
harrys heart is pounding as he walks back through the hellish courtyard
he isnt sure if the dervish captain has realised hes british
its only as he points harry towards the gallows that he realises the predicament hes in
in arabic gesturing to a mound of british dead over there
harry hesitates then walks over to the pile of british corpses convinced hes going to be shot amongst them
in arabic gesturing to the uniforms find one that fits
harry stares at him then slowly begins to understand
hes been picked out as a pale looking arab one that might pass as a british officer from a distance
as he looks around he sees other desert arabs grinning at him wearing their own blood stained british uniforms
harry kneels beside the slaughtered british soldiers
one of them still has his pipe stuffed between his teeth
as harry stares at the obscenity his fear slowly turns to anger
with trembling fingers he unbuttons the dead mans jacket
as he slips the bloodstained british uniform over his shoulders we begin to see the change in his eyes
abou fatma courtyard fortress of abou clea night
abou fatma wanders amongst the dervish army begging for alms searching for harry
finally he spots him at the far end of the courtyard sitting amongst the other dervish warriors in british uniforms
harry courtyard fortress of abou clea night
abou fatma grovels at the feet of the dervishes before he approaches harry
in arabic alms for the poor
harry turns around
his eyes are distant
he looks back at the spot he was staring at before
at first abou fatma thinks hes in shock but then he sees what harrys looking at
across the courtyard stands a large tent surrounded by flags
waiting outside are the four nuer scouts
beginning to see his intent we have to leave
harry wait for me at the gates
as abou fatma starts to protest imshi
the other dervishes look at abou fatma threateningly
abou fatma gets up and walks away reluctantly
across the courtyard the nuer spies have been ushered into the tent
war council tent fortress of abou clea night
the mahdi a tall gaunt warrior in desert robes listens to the nuer scouts in silence
as they notify him of the british advance he starts to draw a battle plan on the tents sandy floor
his lieutenants move closer to see what hes planning
war council tent fortress of abou clea night
outside the tent more dervish warriors have gathered to catch a glimpse of their revered leader
harry is amongst them
he stares at the white clad figures within
suddenly he feels a pair of eyes on him
he turns to see the dervish captain who stopped him earlier watching him intently
harry moves off
the dervish captain stares after him suspiciously
gates fortress of abou clea night
abou fatma waits anxiously outside the fortress gates
the hordes of starving beggars are pushed back as a troop of dervish warriors ride out carrying the naked bodies of the british dead
abou fatma stares after them wondering whats going on
harry courtyard fortress of abou clea night
harry looks behind him
through the milling crowd he sees the dervish captain still following him
his heart pounding harry heads towards the stables trying to give him the slip
harry stables fortress of abou clea night
camels kick and snort in the stable
harry crouches down
through the animals legs he sees the dervish captain enter
suddenly the dervish captain shouts at the top of his voice
the camels scatter leaving harry exposed
the dervish captain stares at him menacingly
harry bows and starts to walk towards him in supplication
his hand slips behind his back groping for the knife thats hidden there
the dervish captain barks at him to stay where he is
as he steps backwards harry suddenly charges and drives the dagger deep into his gut
the dervish captain screams but all that comes out is a terrible hissing sound
harry clamps his hand over the captains mouth and bends his head backwards
as they tumble to the ground harry twists the knife in deeper
the dervish bites down in agony drawing a stream of blood from harrys knuckles
harry rams his fist deeper into the mans throat choking him slowly
meanwhile his knife hand tears its way out of the dervishs gut and plunges back into his thigh
the captains eyes water in pain and fear
harry stares at him crushing his spirit with his own unflinching gaze
as he feels the mans grip weaken he pulls away sharply and swings the knife down with all his force
the blade sticks in the dervish captains chest sending his eyes spinning out of focus forcing a rush of blood out of his mouth
harry watches in horror as the mans eyes roll around desperately trying to find their focus then stop still
he feels his enemys dying breath on his face and hears a horrible sucking sound as he withdraws the knife
harrys arm is elbow deep in gore
he turns away and tries to retch but nothing comes out
he stays like that for a moment bent over the bloody sand contemplating what hes just done
finally he gathers himself grabs the dead man by the ankles and drags him further into the stable
courtyard fortress of abou clea night
harry brushes past the crowds of dervish warriors his eyes fixed on the fortress gates ahead
hes only a few yards away when a dervish sentry calls out in arabic the gates are closed
harry stares at him dangerously
for an instant it looks like another fight may ensue but then a calming voice calls out in arabic let him give us alms
it will bring you both fortune in battle
abou fatma sticks his hands through the fortress gates along with the hundreds of other beggars outside
harry begins to understand
he pulls out some coins from his robes and approaches the beggars
harry whispering to abou fatma as he hands out alms go to the british camp
tell them theyre going to be ambushed
tell them they have to change their route
its a trap
abou fatma stares into harrys eyes seeing the change thats come over them
british column desert valley day
durrance rides at the front of the column
he suddenly stops and stares ahead in horror
all across the desert floor he sees the marble white bodies of dead british soldiers
wild dogs chew at their remains
the whole of the column seems frozen for a moment
then trench suddenly breaks rank and charges the animals screaming at the top of his voice dispersing them with his whip
tents the slope of a hill desert valley day
the column has set up camp until their dead comrades are buried
the officers dig the graves themselves watched by the coolies now
a corporal approaches willoughby and salutes
a native to see you sir
he says he has some intelligence regarding the route were on
abou fatma is pushed forward by the egyptian soldiers
willoughby eyeing him suspiciously what intelligence

the egyptian silences him with a slap to the head
this man is lying
hes a deserter
he stole the camels i went to abu klea
the mahdis forces have captured your garrison
they will attack you in this place
trench and durrance have arrived to see whats happening
trench stares at abou fatma menacingly still seething over the treatment of the british dead
willoughby to trench and durrance this is their idea of misinformation
toying with abou fatma who told you this
a british officer
willoughby mockingly a general no doubt
what else did he tell you
with equal disdain that you wouldnt believe me
willoughby smiles at the nubians gall but trench explodes at his insolence
trench grabbing abou fatma by the neck ill show you a british officer
forcing him on his knees in front of one of the butchered corpses this is a british officer
rubbing abou fatmas face into a patch of bloodstained sand this is a british officers blood

the nubian spins around ready to strike
trench draws his knife daring him to make a move
controlling his anger the muslims bury their dead
even the enemy dead
these bodies have been left here for a reason

to hold you up
willoughby ignoring him take him away
find out why he was sent here
do whatever you have to do
the soldiers disperse
only durrance stays where he is thinking about the nubians warning

the egyptian starts whipping abou fatma again ready to kill him
durrance finally intervenes
he kneels down beside abou fatma staring into his eyes
abou fatma sees no mercy in his gaze but at least theres a glimmer of curiosity
why would you want to help us
the mahdi is allied with slave traders
pause my family were taken prisoners and sold as slaves
durrance considers abou fatmas answer
theres something about it that has a ring of truth
durrance glances at the british soldiers digging graves in the open desert and then stares up at the surrounding hills
gates fortress of abou clea night
through the clouds of dust we see the first of the mahdis army riding out ghostly dinka warriors naked from head to foot caked in white ash
behind then come the nuers long streaked hair trailing in the wind faces painted the colors of a nightmare
the hadendoa spearmen follow blood stained feathers in their hair banging on their calf skin drums
last of all come the dervish riders in their bloodstained british uniforms
harry rides at the heart of the demonic troop his eyes filled with dread
british camp desert valley day
durrance surveys the surrounding hills
castelton watches him curiously

across the camp castelton and trench stare mesmerised as another huge army appears on the opposite hill
this time their banners are black
panicked voices ring out
officers voices form a square

even the dervish warriors seem apprehensive
only the mahdi is calm waiting for his moment
he raises his hand and signals for the horsemen in british uniforms to charge
durrance british camp desert valley day
enemy bullets crackle past durrances head but he doesnt seem to notice
through the smoke and dust he sees hundreds of enemy dead lying in blood smeared heaps

suddenly durrance hears the sound of a bugle
castelton british camp desert valley day

durrance british camp day
durrance stares curiously as a flicker of sunlight streaks across the heads of the distant riders
he watches the approaching dust cloud wondering why its coming at them so fast
slowly he begins to make out the first figures
something about them isnt right

they ride too far apart
he reaches for his gun

harry amongst the charging dervishes day
through the swarming ranks harry glimpses castelton standing alone with his bayonet poised
he calls out as well
castelton hears nothing but the pounding of his own heart
the dervish warriors swarm towards him

harry amongst the charging dervishes day

castelton isolated from the square day
castelton tries to loosen the blade but its no use

somewhere amongst the screaming horde he glimpses a familiar face calling out
a smile flickers across his face
he mouths the words harry as the first of the dervish spears sinks into his heart

he leaps on durrance as he tries to get up pinning him to the ground stopping him getting himself killed
the unsuspecting dervish warriors sweep past them towards their next victims
harry keeps durrance pinned until the enemy hordes disappear
only then does he stand up
he looks down at his friend
durrance doesnt seem to recognise him
at first harry thinks its the sunlight blinding him but then he sees the powder burns around durrances eyes
durrance gropes around
he starts crawling away on his hand and knees
he crawls right into a mud bath of dervish dead
he rears back in horror and lets out a little cry of panic
harry slowly begins to understand
he watches in anguish as his friend claws at his eyes trying to rub the blindness out of them his whimpers of panic turning into howls of agony
british hospital ship alexandria day
the screams of the wounded british soldiers echo all around the hospital ship
captain calder the regimental surgeon stands over durrances bed

reaching in his pocket this came for you
he hands over a letter
durrance sticks it in his top pocket

grinning as he realises calder hasnt caught the joke if you wouldnt mind doctor
he hands the letter back to calder to read for him
glancing over it dear james i hold in my heart all you have written me
he looks up i feel a little awkward reading this
theres something strident in durrances voice a brittleness that hides the insecurity inside
calder continues knowing you as i do and convinced as i am of your affections i wish to go back on my previous fears
im writing now to let you know how grateful i am to have you in my life and to say with all my heart how much i wish to be
with all my love ethne
calder lowers the letter quietly moved
durrance stares out quietly
i knew a man once who went blind a good man too before
a year after you wouldnt have recognised him
he was the most selfish exacting egotistical human being you could ever meet
i wouldnt wish him on anyone
he smiles ironically hiding the heartbreak inside
the one thing i want most in this life finally comes to me when i can no longer accept it
drawing room carolines house outside london day
ethne stares out of the drawing room window waiting
her friend caroline sits at a table pretending to be absorbed in her book listening just as intently
theres the jingle of a carriage outside
it isnt stopping
durrances carriage street carolines house day
durrance stares ahead as the carriage passes carolines house
to the driver drive around once
describe the entrance to me
drawing room carolines house day
ethne turns away from the window
maybe you should have gone to the station to meet him
he might have thought i was going because i imagined he was helpless
i dont want him to feel like that
theres a quiet resolve in ethnes voice as if shes been mulling over her future life with durrance
the doorbell rings
that must be him
caroline gets up to answer the door
ethne walks to the window
her movements are nervous her eyes tense
the door finally opens
durrance walks in alone
as soon as ethne leaves the window he turns around and looks straight at her
startled it isnt true then you can see
gently its perfectly true
i cant see a thing
ethne stops feeling guilty
you moved from the window thats how i knew
i hardly made a noise
no but the window was open
the noise outside grew louder
she tries to answer his smile
let me get you some tea and then we can talk
sensing her tension yes we have a lot to talk about
ethnes hand trembles as she pours the tea
durrance interprets every sound
she picks up the cup and walks over with a smile holding it out for him
i hate to sound humble but i dont trust myself with a cup of tea yet
ethne feels stupid again
she sets the cup down on a table
gently youre not bound you know
theres a pause
ethne knows exactly what he means
bound by what
i wouldnt dream of holding you to your letter
or a committment you made to a different man
ethne stares at him in surprise and then in quiet admiration
youre not a different man
i dont say it begrudgingly
im not being particularly noble or heroic either
its something ive thought about long and hard jack please hear me out
with difficulty im thinking of myself as much as you
i have to learn to accept whats happened
i have to learn to respect the person ive become
the only way to do that is to start again
why does it have to be without me
her words make him hesitate
because if i was with you id spend every moment wondering how you really felt about me
if you dont know how i feel about you then thats a good reason to call off our wedding
your blindness isnt
she stares at him determined
durrance looks touched by her devotion but still doesnt feel worthy of her love
it has to be more than mere obligation ethne or even friendship
it has to be more than that
ethne suddenly reaches out and touches his face
durrance stops as he feels her fingers
hes lost for a moment unsure of himself
ethne leans forward and kisses him tenderly at first but then more and more passionately proving herself to him proving herself to herself
durrance kisses her back close to tears
patio carolines house day
a sharp clatter of hooves
durrance rides his horse with the help of a groom his face fixed in concentration
ethne and caroline watch him from the patio
gazing at him proudly he seems to need his eyes less and less each day
nothing escapes him
sometimes i think he reads me like a book
you no longer have your face to screen your thoughts
ethne doesnt notice the edge in her voice
shes lost in her own thoughts
durrance climbs off his horse and strides towards them looking pleased with himself
wrapping ethne in his arms you smell wonderful
and you smell like a horse
ethne keeps smiling even after durrance has gone
caroline watches her friend quietly fighting the jealousy she feels within
a voice interrupts their separate thoughts gardener o s calling out someone to see you miss eustace
ethne looks up to see a uniformed officer standing with the gardener by the maze
she gets up curiously
garden maze carolines house day
as ethne approaches the soldier she suddenly stops recognising him
willoughby i went all the way to bintree to find you
your father told me you were here
im sorry i came unannounced i needed to talk to you alone
ethne doesnt reply or return his smile
willoughby seems to read her thoughts
willoughby i understand how you feel ethne
all i can say is that we never set out to hurt you
what happened was between us and harry not the two of you
coldly what do you want tom
willoughby hesitates bracing himself
willoughby ive seen harry
he asked me to give you these
he holds out two soiled white feathers
ethne stares at them unable to speak her whole world turned upside down
willoughby he risked his life to save our regiment
he fought as if hed been born to it
ive come to tell you ive withdrawn my accusation of cowardice against him along with casteltons
all she cares about is harry dead
willoughby he was fine when i saw him
hed changed a great deal but he was in good health
willoughby i didnt spend much time with him
i dont know what else to tell you ethne
tell me everything tom
imploringly if by your own admission youve hurt me then i have a right to know
patio carolines house day
caroline watches curiously from the patio as ethne and the mysterious officer walk into the maze deep in conversation
maze carolines house day
ethne and willoughby sit on a bench in the garden maze
willoughby nothing prepared us for what happened
we were two miles short of abou klea when we were ambushed
we managed to hold off the enemy but at a terrible cost
a few days later khartoum fell and the whole expedition was called off
wounded british soldiers lie in the open sun moaning in agony plagued by clouds of dust and swarms of flies
willoughby stares out numb to their suffering thinking only of his own lost friends
the shadow of a man in arab robes hovers over him
the arab doesnt move
willoughby looking up furiously didnt you bloody hear me
willoughby suddenly stops
he stares at the arab as if in a dream
harry stares back at him through his black desert robes
i sent a man to you with a warning from abou klea
you wouldnt listen to him
you had him tortured instead
the confusion and shock bring pent up tears to willoughbys eyes
he told you a british officer had sent him
even if you didnt believe him what would it have cost to take precautions
what more did i have to do
willoughby as the horror sinks in i didnt know harry
i didnt know it was you
he still cant believe his eyes what are you doing here in gods name
what are you doing
harry opens his hand to reveal a soiled white feather
willoughby stares at it in bewilderment at first then slowly beginning to understand
willoughby he gazes at the feather as if its the symbol of his own disgrace now give me the others
give them to me
harry theyre not yours to take back
willoughby looks up at him through his tears
theres no condemnation in harrys eyes but no sympathy either
his experiences have changed him turned him into a harder man
maze carolines house day
ethne gazes silently at the feathers in her hand
willoughby hed followed us all the way from alexandria looking for an opportunity to redeem himself
it was only after he left that i found out an arab matching his description had also saved jack durrances life
ethne looks up in surprise
willoughby jack doesnt know
that was the way harry wanted it
smoke hovers over the corpse strewn battlefield
we see harry through the haze carrying durrance on his shoulders staggering under his friends weight
harry and abou fatma help durrance up a steep mountain trail as below them the battle rages
durrances brow is beaded with sweat
harry cools his face with a wet cloth
durrance murmurs questions in his feverish state but harry remains resolutely silent
maze carolines house day
ethne stares at willoughby thinking only of harry
willoughby thinks shes staring at the medals on his chest
willoughby embarrassed i tried to turn them down
i told the committee id done nothing to deserve them
they didnt care
i think they pick their heroes names out of a hat
trying to ease her pain you asked me how hed changed
all i can say is that you would have been proud of him
i should have been proud of him before
or at least i should have tried to understand
willoughby you cant blame yourself
why not if you can
she wont forgive herself we all misjudged him but i had the least excuse
he was the man i was supposed to love
suddenly a voice calls out durrance o s ethne
they turn around startled
durrance stands at the entrance to the maze
willoughby gets up nervously
whispering urgently please i dont want him to know youre here
durrance looks in their direction
willoughby in disbelief he can see us
he cant see a thing
durrance reaches out and feels the hedge finding his bearings taking slow steps into the maze ethne
ethne keeps quiet
she watches durrance wracked with guilt
willoughby beginning to panic ive got to say something
durrance is only a few yards away from them now
he stares a moment as if at ethne then turns and walks back
window carolines house day
caroline sees durrance walking away from the maze still calling out for ethne
maze carolines house day
durrances voice fades in the distance
struggling with her emotions i didnt want him to find out what you just told me
willoughby harry was his best friend im engaged to jack
im going to marry him
willoughby stares in surprise
willoughby i knew hed proposed i had no idea youd accepted
considering the implications id never have told you if i knew
im sure harry wouldnt have wanted me to
im glad you did
i needed to know
looking at him do you know where harry is now
willoughby he didnt tell me anything i didnt feel i had a right to ask please tell me the truth
theres no anger in her voice only concern
willoughby looks torn
willoughby some of our men were taken prisoner
the dervishes took them south in case we tried a rescue
trench was among the missing
ethne smiles sadly as if she has her answer
willoughby trying to give her hope harry may be determined but he isnt mad
hell look for trench and then hell come back
hell do whatever he has to do
there are still two feathers left
window carolines house day
from her window caroline sees ethne and willoughby saying goodbye walking off in different directions
as ethne approaches the house caroline sees her gazing at something in her hand
stairway carolines house day
caroline walks down the stairs
is everything alright
forcing a smile he was a friend of fathers
he apologised for not introducing himself
he was in a hurry
caroline doesnt press
she notices the two white feathers in ethnes hand
living room carolines house night
ethne sits at the piano stool still gazing at the feathers in her hand
she hears voices in the corridor
its durrance asking caroline where she is
ethne hears his footsteps approaching
she lifts up the piano lid and starts to play
the living room door opens
ethne ignores the quiet footsteps behind her
she feels durrance listening to every note
his hands cover her eyes gently
trying to smile who could that be
she removes his hands from her eyes and kisses them
durrance sits down beside her on the piano stool
what were you playing
the melusine overture
he grins and starts to play the tune perfectly
ethne looks on in admiration trying to hide her feelings
id rather listen
reluctantly ethne starts to accompany him
they say you can tell a womans heart by the way she plays
what if she cant play at all
it isnt how well you play its how passionately you stroke the keys
ethne presses the keys harder pretending its a joke worried that he might see through her
id say youre in love
even though its said in jest his words stick like a knife
the notes torture her
she suddenly gets up and walk away from the piano
following her footsteps where are you going
i want to hear you play on your own
a moments silence
then durrance turns back to the piano and starts to play quietly tenderly
the haunting music breaks ethnes heart
almost involuntarily she starts to walk away from him towards the open patio doors
with a sudden flourish of the keys there you go im in love too
he swivels around and beams at her joyfully
ethne stares back at him unable to speak
gazing at her adoringly these past few days have been the best days of my life blind or otherwise
his eyes shine in the candlelight full of new found hope
before i came here id given up
i put on all kinds of fronts and defences but deep down i was petrified
i had no idea what was going on around me what people were thinking behind my back
i imagined the worst so that nothing would surprise me no one would catch me out
he walks closer
youve made me realise i cant live like that
whether one can see or not theres no way of knowing how people really feel about you all you can do is put yourself in their hands and trust them
ethne cant speak
i know how much you loved harry
a beat for the first time im not afraid to admit it im not not afraid to bring it up between us
a beat im not afraid because of you ethne because of the way youve made me feel
he waits for an answer but all that greets him is silence
as he steps closer he suddenly loses her presence
a touch of panic enters his voice ethne
the only sound he hears is the wind on the curtains
we see for the first time that ethnes left through the open patio doors
he turns around sharply as he hears a noise
caroline stands in the doorway
durrance walks towards her
touching her arm i thought youd disappeared
durrance pulls back embarrassed
she must be in the garden
trying to sound lighthearted she was here a minute ago
it must have been something i said
every word is calculated i dont think it was anything you said
shes been upset all afternoon
ever since she spoke to lieutenant willoughby
he looks perplexed
willoughby was here
why didnt he come and see me
i thought he did
i saw you walking into the maze to join them
she feels the impact on him the fact that he called out and no one answered
trying to justify it to himself he must have had his reasons
he brought her two white feathers
thats all i know
durrance looks up startled
caroline watches his unseeing eyes trying to make sense of whats happened
she feels a touch of remorse as she sees him struggling with his emotions
finally he looks up ethne obviously didnt want me to know
curiously why did you tell me
i thought you should know
youre her friend
yours too i hope
durrance stares at her in silence her intentions slowly becoming clear to him
youre not fair to ethne
her meaning is clear
her words sting him deeply
how much of our conversation did you overhear
then you should know i meant every word
more with pity than anger i love and trust ethne unconditionally
whatever doubts shes feeling i know shell resolve them
with quiet dignity ive put myself in her hands
a long silence
durrance doesnt need to see caroline to know shes in tears
the only reason i told you was because you mean the world to me
a gentle rebuff im sorry mrs adair
garden carolines house night
ethne sits in the garden alone shivering in the wind hating herself
the city of dongola southern sudan night
the peeling corpse of a british soldier is dragged through the streets by a rope tied to a camels back
local women tear at the dead mans uniform grabbing at his testicles spitting on his bloated face
harry slips out of the crowd horrified by what hes seen relieved it isnt trench
dongola sudan day
the jeering women can be heard in the distance
abou fatma sits in the shade slurping an oily gruel
harry squats beside him
abou fatma offers him the bowl
youre surprised by the women
harry doesnt need to answer his face says it all
theyre always the most cruel
amongst the southern tribes its the custom for them to go into battle first calling the men cowards until theyre ready to fight
mischievously it is the same in your country no
harry looks up to find abou fatma grinning at him
the woman you spoke of
go back to her
tell her youre ready
harry what did you find out about the british prisoners
there are very few of them left
he offers harry his food again
this time harry takes the bowl and swallows the rancid meat as if its nothing
harry where are they being held
your army abandoned them
the shame is no longer yours
harry provoking him have i paid you for nothing abou fatma
the nubian looks up stung by the talk of money when he was only expressing concern
coldly twelve british soldiers were taken by boat from here to omdurman last month
youre a foolish man
even for a british officer
harry smiling god protects the fool
passing abou fatma the bowl how would i get into the prison at omdurman
sarcastically urinate in a holy well
harry that carries a penalty of death
all i want is to be imprisoned there
abou fatma stops eating realising harry is serious
you will die before your time
harry if it is the will of god
impatient now this man turned his back on you
why should you give your life for his
harry because hed do the same for me
no matter what had passed between us
looking at the nubian i hope id do the same for you too
i have no need of such friends
the nubian returns to his food betraying no sentiment
harry reaches into his pocket and holds out five shilling coins
disdainfully you owe me two shillings a day
this is too much
harry cant help smiling
harry you still havent answered my question
you answered it yourself
god protects the fool
night market outside the city of omdurman night
harry stumbles around the marketplace strumming on a broken zither pestering people for money pretending to be mad
the passing crowds laugh at him and push him away
abou fatma watches from across the street
harry staggers through the torchlit stalls
he sees a group of dervish warriors gathered around a fire
their leader a sickly looking emir smokes a hashish pipe as he listens to his men recounting their feats of war
next to him lies a beautiful jewel encrusted scabbard
harry thinks a moment then approaches the group strumming his zither grinning at the men
seeing the crazed musician the dervish warriors cover their ears
some of them toss chunks of meat at him
harry picks up the dusty morsels chewing them with relish grinning like a happy puppy
abou fatma watches as harry humiliates himself playing his broken zither for the emir
the emir gazes back at him through bored bloodshot eyes
as the warriors laugh harry suddenly bends down and snatches the emirs scabbard
he runs off with it at speed waving it around his head like a sword yelling at the top of his voice
the dervish warriors give chase still laughing as they run after the lunatic
harry stumbles over a tent pole deliberately
the dervish warriors swarm around him caning him with their sticks
harry protects his face with his hands pleading harry in arabic god loves the fool
god loves the fool
well outside the city of omdurman night
the whole marketplace has gathered to watch the madman punished
the warriors hoist harry up onto a well and shout at him to walk around the rim
holding out his hands harry starts to step around the ledge
as he glances down he sees the drop is at least thirty feet deep
two of the warriors jump onto the ledge behind him blowing bugles in his ear
in arabic faster thief
harry starts to walk faster clapping in time with the warriors performing for the crowd
harry in arabic god loves the fool
god loves the fool
another warrior steps out of the crowd and starts prodding harry with his spear
the crowd roars as harry almost topples into the well
he regains his footing and laughs back at them clapping his hands wriggling his hips
spectators voice in arabic heres someone for him to dance with
harry looks down to see a hideous half naked hag being pushed towards him
the crowd clears a space for the two lunatics to dance
harry forces a crazed giggle as the hag starts to undulate and thrust her hips at him
he echoes her movements staring into her deadened eyes
the crowd pushes them closer together
harry feels an overwhelming sense of pity and dread
the dreamlike intensity is getting to him
the tragic creature shimmying before his eyes is like a grotesque reminder of the woman he loved and lost
the hag starts murmuring to herself
as he listens harry realises shes singing a tuneless lament remembered from long ago sung without any understanding now
the emotion wells up in harrys eyes even as he laughs at her
its as if hes gazing into a crazy distorted mirror
the emir stares curiously as he catches the emotion in harrys eyes
he suddenly signals for his men to part the lunatics
harry is dragged away from the shrieking hag and flung before him
in arabic suspicious now play for me fool
harry picks up his zither and starts to play a tuneless din
in arabic youre not mad
harry pretends not to understand
the emir suddenly cracks his cane down on harrys hands breaking his fingers
harry screams in agony harry in arabic god loves the fool
in arabic the fool feels no pain
the emir beats him again with the cane
harry holds up his broken fingers in supplication singing softly in his madmans gibberish
harry in arabic god loves the fool
the emirs cane cracks open his face
he doubles over in agony spitting out blood
abou fatma watches sickened unable to do anything
even the other spectators look shaken
harry slithers away in the dust whimpering like an animal
in arabic youre not mad
tell me who are you
tell me or ill kill you
abou fatma stares in silence willing harry to speak
many in the crowd turn away fearing the worst
the emir raises his cane
with a surge of effort harry lifts up his blood soaked face and grins at the emir
he looks barely human his face ripped open swollen beyond recognition
harry singing softly in arabic god loves the fool
god loves the fool
the emir hesitates convinced nobody in their right mind could take this much pain
in arabic hes mad
take him to the prison
let him sing for them there
he turns away and disappears into the crowd
abou fatma stares at harry with both pity and admiration
he whispers a prayer for his friends safety
prison of omdurman banks of the nile night
the evening prayers drift over the waters of the nile
in the distance we see the prison of omdurman a huge dome of stone surrounded by fifty foot walls on three sides and the river itself on the fourth
house of stone prison omdurman night
hundreds of shapes move forward in the darkness
at first they look like a herd of animals but slowly we recognise the grunts and cries as human
faces come at us out of the dark screaming and cursing shoving each other violently raising their faces to the ceiling gasping for air
as our eyes adjust to the light the vision of hell intensifies
the prisoners are manacled and herded into a space no more than thirty feet wide
they circle the room in a clockwise direction pushed on by each other in perpetual motion afraid that if they stop theyll be sucked under the maelstrom and trampled underfoot
the most fortunate are those whove found a resting space in the corners of the room
they cling to the walls fighting off anyone who tries to share their sanctuary
from somewhere amongst them we hear a familiar voice trench get away
this is ibrahims space
trench protects his corner lashing out at anyone who tries to breach the space
he bellows at the top of his voice trench ibrahim where are you
a voice answers from the heaving mass
trench holds out his hand and drags his friend ibrahim out of the scrum
trench sounding half crazed you mustnt fall
you musnt fall
as if to prove his point a fight breaks out at the far side of the room
trench stands on tiptoes as eager as everyone else to see the outcome
two prisoners try to strangle each other with their chains fighting for an inch of space
its hard to make out anything in the dark but the savagery of the fight is reflected in the speed of flailing fists and feet
one of the prisoners finally loses his footing
in an instant hes sucked under
the victor laughs maniacally
the losers cries continue for a moment and then stop suddenly as the trampling feet break his neck
trench turns to ibrahim with the knowing look of an expert
trench we mustnt fall ibrahim
we musnt fall
suddenly theres a cry from outside the cell door
prison guards o s in arabic back
the prisoners closest to the door push away
the head guard the towering idris es saier tosses in a blazing torch to clear some space
a new prisoner is flung inside and the door slammed shut behind him
the other prisoners surge back trying to reclaim their space
there are cries of pain as some of them tread on the blazing torch
the sheer weight of men quickly puts it out
the new prisoner holds onto anything he can to stop himself falling
from his corner trench looks on grimly
trench watch ibrahim
hes going to fall
the new prisoner is swept up in the savage wave
as he approaches trenchs corner he tries to claw his way to safety
trench beats him back with a flurry of blows
the prisoner disappears under the heaving bodies but then he pops up again gasping for breath
he fights with all his might swinging his fists clutching at anyone in his way
trench looks impressed but he knows it wont be long
trench hell fall
youssef will get him
as the new prisoner swings towards them again the prisoner behind him youssef slams his chains down on his head
the new arrival goes down hard
as he disappears he screams out the name trench
trench stares in disbelief frozen for a moment then bellowing like a bull he charges out of his corner and flails his way through the heaving mass trying to retrieve
the fallen prisoner
help me ibrahim
the tall arab fights his way to trench
together they pull the new prisoner to his feet
they take him under each arm and fall in with the moving mass
trench weve lost our place
you mustnt fall
the man almost collapses but trench holds him up
he and ibrahim keep walking the prisoner trying to keep him conscious knowing they have to fight till daybreak now
house of stone prison omdurman day
the sound of early morning prayers drifts into the house of stone
sunbeams pick out bloodmarks and broken nails where prisoners have tried to claw their way to safety
half a dozen bodies lie crushed on the floor those who didnt make it through the night
those who did are ushered outside by the prison guards into the merciless heat
trench and ibrahim support the new prisoner
a fat oily looking prison guard hassan sneers at trench on his way out
youve found a friend english
trench ignores him blinking as he walks into the sun
courtyard prison omdurman day
the prisoners collapse as they stumble into the prison courtyard exhausted by the previous nights efforts
trench and ibrahim help the new prisoner to the rivers edge
riverbank courtyard prison omdurman day
trench kneels beside the prisoner and pours some water over his face
the man opens his lips to swallow it
trench dont drink
your body isnt strong enough
beads of sweat shine on the bearded mans ravaged face
trench studies his features wondering who he is
he digs out a copper coin from his shoe
trench to ibrahim see if hassan will sell us some drinking water
ibrahim sets off towards hassan whos busy beating the other prisoners to their feet
trench looking back you speak english
new prisoner a trace of a smile appears on his cracked lips i hope so after all this time
trench stares at him in surprise
trench how do you know my name
new prisoner you told it to me yourself
the first time we met
imitating trench weakly trench by name and trench by nature
good to meet you feversham
trench stares in astonishment
harrys eyes move around and find him twinkling mischievously despite all the pain
harry with ironic good humor you look well
trench breaking into a smile not half as well as you
overwhelmed what the hell are you doing here
harry id come to rescue you
but now that youve rescued me
i have to save you twice
trench stares at him in disbelief
harry i have some money to bribe the guards
theres a man waiting for us across the river
with camels and provisions
trench snapping out of his reverie hushing him keep your voice down
trench looks across the courtyard to make sure no ones watching them
hassan is busy bargaining with ibrahim over the cup of water
trench under his breath how much money
harry two hundred
trench looks hopeful for the first time in weeks
i knew it wasnt true
the guards kept telling me our army had left us behind
how far away are they
harry regrettably they pulled out
over a month ago
trench stares in confusion
then who sent you
harry you did
trench doesnt understand
harry slowly opens his fingers to reveal a crushed white feather in his hand
trench stares at it in bewilderment
then suddenly he starts to laugh full of anguish and joy amazed by the madness of the world
prison gates courtyard prison omdurman day
the compound gates rumble open
the prisoners relatives are ushered inside kept in order by the guards whips
the prisoners limp as fast as they can to receive any food their families have brought them
before they can eat the guards have to be paid off idris first then hassan and the others
as the feeding frenzy breaks out we hear trenchs voice trench v o hassans the only guard whos corruptible
for two hundred hell get us on the graveyard detail
riverbank courtyard prison omdurman day
we see what hes talking about now
the dead bodies from the house of stone are dumped in a row boat
the guards order several prisoners onto the boat with them
theyre too afraid to handle the corpses themselves
trench v o the farthest the boat goes is a hundred yards from the opposite shore
well have to wait until youre strong enough to swim
harry watches the boat drift into the middle of the river
ripples appear as huge crocodiles move in to feed
the prisoners toss the bodies in the water
the corpses float for a moment then suddenly vanish in a froth of blood
trench smiling grimly you didnt think of that when you came
harry i didnt think of much when i came
trench looks at him still unable to believe anyone could be so reckless and so brave
trench all for a feather
harry lightly more than one
trench looks down at the sand reflecting trench give it to me harry
trench so i can show you it means nothing that if i throw it in the river itll float away end up between some crocs teeth
harry smiling softly not this feather
its got the measure of me
itll float back and find me
the water laps quietly in the silence
trench there were a dozen british officers here last month
every time one of them died the last words on his lips were dont worry about me lads
our boys will come and get you
they never did
id say youve done enough
harry not until i get you out
trench you can hardly walk
harry i dont need to walk i need to swim
he smiles at trench affectionately
across the river the boat returns silhouetted against the sunset
house of stone prison omdurman day
the prisoners are herded back into the house of stone
hassan walks alongside trench and harry negotiating his bribe
hassan god put you here for a reason english
he tests us
i have fifteen starving children myself to care for
trench taking his cue i was thinking of your children hassan
id like to help them
god favours the almsgiver
hassan for three hundred i could feed them for a year
trench i can afford two
from myself ibrahim and the madman
hassan nods accepting the offer and walks ahead
house of stone prison omdurman night
harry and trench are in the thick of the crowd fighting for space trying to give each other strength
trench the first thing i do when i get back is book a table at wiltons
a private room all to myself no bloody crowds
he shoves into the man in front gaining a few more precious inches for them to breathe in
trench ill start with a half shell of crab then ill order the mallard medium rare
harry a glass of burgundy to wash it down
trench nothing foreign
a pint of stoutll do me fine
harry grinning well im getting on the first train to bintree crowded or not
trench ill drink to that
he raises his hand as if hes in a crowded pub trying to get the barmans attention two pints please
the two of them surge through the crowd laughing like lunatics
trench a few more days harry
a few more days
house of stone prison omdurman day
the morning call to prayer brings sobs of relief from the prisoners
harry trench and ibrahim lie in a corner of the room exhausted by the nights efforts
hassan steps over the dead bodies littering the floor and orders them to get up
hassan as planned you three take the bodies to the boat
harry and ibrahim get to their feet
trench doesnt move
harry reaches down to give him a hand when he suddenly sees how pale his friend is
he drops to his knees feeling trenchs pulse
hes alive but very weak
hassan looking at the unconscious trench you see english
god didnt want you to leave
he has given you umm sabbah
trench moans gripped by typhus fever
harry tries to help him up refusing to believe their plans are dashed
harry whispering trench get up
hassan shouting at harry in arabic leave him
carry the dead to the boat
harry ignores him cradling trench in his arms
hassan steps forward and lashes him hard across the back
harry still trying to rouse trench get up trench
hassan lashes him again
this time harry spins around and grabs the whip
he stares at hassan dangerously the frustration and disappointment pushing him to the edge
in arabic he paid me to release you
if you dont want to go you can rot with him
turning to ibrahim what about you
ibrahim looks at trench guiltily then gets up and walks towards the dead bodies
harry gathers trench in his arms and holds him protectively like a faithful slave
hassan sneers and strides out of the house of stone
harry looks at trench
his friend shivers feverishly
harry brushes the wet hair out of his face harry well get you to wiltons
crab and mallard medium rare
riverbank prison omdurman day
harry watches from the shore as ibrahim tosses the corpses overboard
suddenly the arab takes his chance and dives
hes only yards away from the boat when hes lifted into air by a huge crocodile and dragged below the murky depths
all is still again
harry looks back at trench lying by the rivers edge lost in his own feverish dreams
study general fevershams house london day
ethne sits across from general feversham in the dimly lit room
theres bright sunshine outside but very little of it gets in
general feversham seems much older than the first time we saw him his eyes are withdrawn his movements restless
he rings the handbell irritably
dont worry about the biscuits general
general feversham i wanted some myself
i need something sweet in the afternoons otherwise i fall asleep
catching himself not today of course
ethne tries to answer his smile but neither of them is particularly convincing
general feversham im very touched youve come all this way to tell me your good news
jackll make you a wonderful husband
hiding all her doubts hell be pleased to hear that
general feversham im very fond of the boy
general feversham smiles weakly and looks away
whatever they talk about seems to come back to harry
ethne finally broaches the subject have you heard any news from the sudan
general feversham hesitates
general feversham an old friend of mine came to visit me yesterday colonel sutch
you probably remember him
ethne nods panicking inside sensing the old mans grief
general feversham he used to receive the occasional letter from harry letting him know that he was alright
his voice falters harry made him promise not to tell me anything unless the letters stopped
im afraid they did
over a month ago
ethne looks pale
she tries to hold back her tears for the generals sake
im sure it doesnt mean anything
general feversham i asked some friends at the war office to make some enquiries
according to their spies all the british prisoners are dead
ethne cant speak
the old man fights his tears as well
general feversham would you like to see his letters
barely a whisper im not sure i could cope right now
general feversham no of course not
ethne looks up remembering his grief is as great as hers
have you looked at them
general feversham oh yes
they make wonderful reading
his face lights up briefly he travelled all the way from alexandria to suakin
across three hundred miles of desert
from there he followed the camel corp disguised as a coolie
he fought with them at abou klea excelled himself by all accounts saved dozens of lives
if he was still a soldier theyd have probably given him the victoria cross
her eyes shining with tears you must be very proud
the old man nods suffering again
general feversham there isnt a trace of fear in the writing
thats what i find so hard to understand
that someone could be so terrified of going to war and yet when the time comes to face it for real he embraces it almost gratefully
sharing his guilt we all misjudged him
general feversham you only knew him a short time
i had no excuse
seeing him overcome by guilt and grief ethne gets up and takes his hand
general feversham holds hers tightly
general feversham my son loved jack durrance like a brother
i know hed be happy for you
hed want you to live your lives
ethne nods gratefully unable to speak her whole world falling apart
courtyard prison omdurman day
the prisoners tear and claw at each other like wild animals desperately trying reach a scrap of meat thats fallen to the floor
harry is in the thick of the fighting elbowing and head butting people out of his way
hes changed beyond recognition and it isnt just physical
he fights with a primal savagery oblivious to everything except the precious scrap of food
he finally gets hold of it and swings his elbow round breaking another prisoners nose
rivers edge courtyard prison omdurman day
trench lies by the riverside sweating and shivering from fever his eyes sunken back into his skull
harry kneels beside him covered in blood
he holds out the scrap of meat
you have to eat
trench cant move his jaw let alone eat
harry chews the meat for him
when its soft between his teeth he spits it out and feeds trench with his fingers
for all the primal horror theres a touching human tenderness in the moment
suddenly a pair of hands grab harry by the hair and drag him away from trench
the giant prison guard tears the scrap of meat from harrys hands and kicks him in the ribs for good measure
spitting out blood harry crawls after him no longer having to play the madman hes halfway there
harry in arabic food master food master please
idris lashes him with his whip
harrys body arches in pain but his brain hardly registers
he kisses the ground at idriss feet still begging for his scrap of food back
harry in arabic food master
idris walks away in disgust
house of stone prison omdurman night
harry holds up the semi conscious trench as theyre buffeted around in the house of stone
the other prisoners try to push them under but harry defends trench with the savagery of a veteran
a prisoner tries to blind trench with his hands but harry grabs his fingers sinking his teeth in as far as they will go
house of stone prison omdurman day
daylight streams through the open doors
harry rests trench against a wall and scavenges amongst the bodies of the dead searching for any money they may have hidden
courtyard prison omdurman day
harry runs over to hassan and drops to his knees in supplication holding out a copper coin harry pleading in arabic food master
my master needs food
hassan holds out his arm to reveal a stump where his hand should be
hassan in arabic this is what idris gave me for helping your master
spitting at harrys feet theres some food
hassan turns and walks towards the fortress gates
the other prisoners scramble after him desperate to receive their daily handout from their relatives
harry thinks about wading in and fighting them for it but he has no energy left
he collapses in the sand staring up at the sun
as he closes his eyes he suddenly hears a whisper arab boy o s english
harry looks up to see a small arab boy approaching him
the boy stops as he sees harrys ravaged face frightened by his mad staring eyes
harry sees the piece of chicken in his hand and waves him over
the arab boy finally kneels down and offers him the chicken bone
harry snatches it and gnaws on it like a hungry animal
its only when he examines the meat making sure theres enough left for trench that we realise how human he still is
he slips the half eaten chicken bone in his robes and looks at the arab boy gratefully
the arab boy holds out some coins for him
from abou fatma
harry stares at the coins
its all the money hes ever paid abou fatma
harry moneys no good anymore
we cant bribe the guards
i need him to buy food and medecine for my friend
he stops as he realises the arab boy doesnt understand a word
he gives him back the coins harry in arabic tell abou fatma to buy us food
you bring me the food
he points to the other relatives as if to explain
the arab boy nods that he understands
harry is about to ask him more when he suddenly spots idris walking towards them menacingly
thank abou fatma
thank him for me
the arab boy gets up and walks away
harry watches him leave already missing the human contact
as idris approaches he scrambles away reduced to his bestial state again
courtyard riverside prison omdurman day
harry pours water over trenchs face
harry youre better trench
you may not feel it but you look it
trench opens his eyes conscious enough for the first time in weeks to see how much his friend has changed
trench smiling weakly when im better
will i look as bad as you
harry smiles through bleeding gums and swollen cheeks
the evening prayer starts up behind them
trench closes his eyes in despair
trench i dont think of god anymore when i hear that sound
it used to give me hope
now all i feel is dread
harry dont talk like that
were going to get you through this
trench i dont want to get through this harry
in the distance they hear idris shouting at the prisoners driving them back into the house of stone
theres only one thing that frightens me now
the thought that the closer i come the more desperately afraid and sure i am that all this will end right here
when i so wish i could die at home
fighting tears in my own country in my own village
to be buried beneath the trees i know in sight of the church and houses i know
beside the trout stream where i fished when i was a boy
trying to smile are you laughing yet
no im not laughing
harry fights his own pain
trench i dont think i can take it anymore harry
harry finds it hard to argue
staring at trenchs ravaged face and withered body all he can do is nod in sympathy
courtyard prison omdurman day
harry sits opposite the young arab boy in the courtyard
theres a look of quiet resignation in his eyes as he stares at the small glass vial in his hand
harry in arabic thank abou fatma for me
ask him to pray for us
the arab boy nods sadly as if hes seeing harry for the last time
harry pats him on the shoulder and gets up
house of stone prison omdurman night
harry and trench lean against a wall watching as the house of stone fills with prisoners
trenchs eyes are filled with dread
harry quietly we had a visitor today
trench turns and looks at him
harry opens his hand to reveal the small glass vial
trench stares at the dark liquid inside slowly realising what it is
anything would be better than this
are you sure
trench nods his decision made
harry slipping him the vial the poison will take a few hours to work
you wont feel any pain
smiling grimly thatll make a change
harry looks at him sadly then turns away preparing for the inevitable charge from the other prisoners
trench one last thing harry
harry turns around
trench my feather
id like it back
harry stares in silence
trench holds out his hand
harry takes it
as they finally let go we see the soiled white feather in trenchs palm
trench closes his fingers around it gratefully
trench i hope it gives me as much strength as it gave you
their eyes stay on each other full of friendship and respect
then steeling himself trench snaps the vial and starts to drink
trench smiling sadly i didnt mean to be a pig about it
he holds out the vial for harry
harry takes it and swallows the rest of the poison
he grins at trench
harry what do you say we give them one last night of hell
trench ill drink to that
shoulder first harry charges into the massing prisoners
trench follows him laughing through his tears
the prisoners stumble out of the house of stone covered in blood from the previous nights fighting
idris looks down at the broken bodies at his feet
harry and trench are amongst the dead
idris prods them both with his spear making sure
in arabic take them to the boats
courtyard riverside prison omdurman day
a dozen bodies are dumped one on top of the other in two funeral boats
hassan takes charge of one idris the other
boats river omdurman day
the guards hold onto the sides of the boat steadying themselves in case a crocodile tries to ram
the prisoners charged with throwing the bodies overboard stare into the water terrified of the unseen monsters lurking below
hassans boat river omdurman day
the corpses are piled high in hassans boat a mass of chalk white flesh
as we follow a rivulet of blood into the heap we see harrys face
his eyes suddenly open
very much alive
they move around trying to locate trench
above him he feels the corpses being lifted off easing the burden on his back
river omdurman day
arrows break the surface as the giant crocodiles move in
hassans boat river omdurman day
harry finally glimpses trench
his friend is still unconscious
in tiny movements harry slips through the ice cold flesh that separates them and slides over trenchs body trying to ensure hes thrown overboard first
idriss boat river omdurman day
blood boils around the boats as more bodies are tossed overboard
as idris stares into the murky depths he sees a fifteen foot monster dragging away a translucent corpse
hassans boat river omdurman day
harry and trench are the only bodies left in hassans boat
harry braces himself as hes lifted into the air
his body is swung out three times and thrown overboard
river omdurman day
harry feels the warm water envelop him
any trace of paralysis the poison has left disappears in an instant driven away by sheer terror
through the eerie green haze he glimpses the dreamlike silhouettes of the crocodiles feasting on the corpses dragging them along the river bed
harrys instincts are to swim away as fast as he can but even now he remembers trench
the water above him explodes as trench is hurled in
harry swims up to the surface and grabs hold of his friend
idriss boat river omdurman day
idris stares curiously as he watches the two bodies drifting away
the water around them is bubbling but theres no blood
its only as he looks more closely that idris realises one of the bodies is kicking his feet swimming away
idris in arabic hassan
hassans boat river omdurman day
hassan turns around to see harry and trench disappearing with the current
he takes out his pistol
river omdurman day
holding the unconscious trench in his arms harry swims towards the fastest point of the river hoping the current will drag him away from the crocodiles and the boats
hassans boat river omdurman day
hassan aims the pistol with his good hand
hes about to squeeze the trigger when theres a loud explosion from the opposite shore
a bullet smashes through his skull and hurls him into the water
opposite shore river omdurman day
the man who fired the shot lowers his rifle
its abou fatma
he kicks his camel and gallops along the riverbank trying to keep up with harry and trench in the water
idriss boat river omdurman day
idris stares after them in fury
he orders the guards to row into the current and give chase
river omdurman day
harry and trench tumble through the churning water the current boiling all around them
there are splashes of water as bullets explode
opposite shore river omdurman day
abou fatma dismounts as he sees harry and trench being picked off
he takes up a position near the riverbank and fires at the pursuing boat
idriss boat river omdurman day
idris ducks as one of his guards is hit
he shouts at the remaining guards to fire back at abou fatma
river omdurman day
harry and trench keep disappearing under the water
as he surfaces briefly harry looks around
he sees the current hurtling towards a row of jagged rocks
river omdurman day
idris aims at the distant figure on the riverbank and fires a volley of shots
opposite shore river omdurman day
two bullets spin abou fatma round grazing him in the leg knocking the rifle out of his hand
limping as fast as he can he takes cover behind the camels
idriss boat river omdurman day
idris looks back at harry and trench ready to pick them off
suddenly his eyes stop
he sees the jagged rocks in his path
he yells at the guards to row against the current
river omdurman day
the current picks up speed as it hurtles towards the rocks
harry holds trench tightly anticipating the impact
the current sweeps them right through the rocks
opposite shore river omdurman day
abou fatma watches from the riverbank as idriss boat tumbles helplessly towards the rocks
idriss boat river omdurman day
the guards leap off the boat at the last moment but the current sweeps them up and dashes their brains against the rocks
only idris holds on
the boat breaks up all around him but protects him from the full impact
river omdurman day
harry and trench surface on the other side of the rocks
huge tree roots jut out near the riverbank
the current is still strong but its swimmable
opposite shore river omdurman day
abou fatma rides after the disappearing bodies
giant tree root river omdurman day
harry reaches out and grabs a jutting tree root
with his legs clamped around trench he pulls them out of the fastest point of the current
as he looks behind him he sees idris disappear under the torrent
catching his breath harry starts to clamber along the root trying to make it to the safety of the riverbank
trench groans fully conscious now
harry were going to make it
trench stares at harry with an almost childlike trust
harry see if you can touch the bottom
trench dips his feet under nodding as they touch the riverbed
harry grab the root
trench grips the root
harry swims around him
harry now walk to the riverbank
trench my legs are broken
harry your legs are fine
the poison paralyses the body
its worn off
gripping the root trench starts to walk against the current the water flowing up to his neck
slowly the river shallows
harry looks relieved as his friend finally tumbles onto the riverbank and collapses
hes about to follow him when suddenly a pair of hands shoot out of the water and grab him around the neck
hes also managed to clamber his way to safety
with a howl of rage he pulls harrys face under the water
harry kicks and flails
with one huge hand idris keeps him under the surface with the other he holds onto the giant tree root
harry tries to loosen his grip but he isnt strong enough
he reaches down into the riverbed and gropes around until he finds a rock
he grinds it into idriss wrist like a pummel stone
idris whips his hand away in pain
harry is instantly sucked out of his grasp
the current smashes him headlong into another root downriver
idris stares at his escaped prey in fury
his anger clouds his reason
he lets go of his own root and lets the current drag him to harrys
riverbank omdurman day
harry drags himself towards the riverbank
hes only a few yards away when idriss hands grab him again
harry turns around swinging and catches idris on the jaw
both of them tumble in the water
they wrestle beneath the surface then shoot up again tearing at each other like wild animals
idris grabs harry by the hair and slams his face down on his knee smashing his nose
the searing pain staggers harry
he tries to crawl away but idris stamps on his back flattening him
he drops to his knees and grinds harrys face into the riverbed
as he pulls him back up by the hair we see harrys mangled features a mask of blood eyes staring out jaws hanging open in defeat
for a moment time seems to slow then suddenly shaking his head free harry screams a savage primal cry and drives his elbow back into idriss face shattering bone and
idris falls back stunned
harry has his chance to get away but hes not interested now
he wades after idris an expression of pure uncontrollable rage in his eyes
as idris tries to pick himself up harry slams both fists into his mouth smashing his teeth down his throat
its idriss turn to look scared
he tries to crawl away but the bloody faced demon is on him in seconds ramming his head back under the water
idris manages to kick him away briefly but it only enrages harry
he comes back at idris with a large rock between his hands cracking his face open
and still he isnt finished
sitting astride the gurgling prison guard harry raises both arms as high as theyll go and smashes the rock into idriss face again and again
the guards blood splatters all over him but harry hardly seems to notice
hes gripped by a savage primordial fury
everything hes suffered has built up to this point
hes at his highest and lowest ebb
his hands whirr up and down his eyes glow feverishly his lips curl in a terrifying sneer
strong arms grab him from behind but harry ignores them hammering away
hes beyond hatred beyond compassion face to face with his deepest darkest self
again the arms try to pull him off but harry brushes them aside
the blood and tears stream down his cheeks
he howls like an animal
his hands finally slow as his arms reach exhaustion
this time abou fatma manages to pull him off
harry collapses in his arms and weeps like a baby finally breaking out of the darkness no longer sure who or what he is anymore
abou fatma holds him tightly hushing him comforting him understanding
country lane bintree england day
a primal silence
mist hovers over the emerald fields
in the distance a carriage approaches
as it draws nearer we see harry sitting in the back
his scars have healed but his eyes have the far away look of someone whos seen too much
the outlines of the village church appear through the fog
harry hears a dog barking
harry to the driver could you stop here
church bintree day
the barking grows louder as harry enters the churchyard
he sees a collie tied to a post
its dermods dog
harry bends down and strokes the animal
then he looks up through the open church door
church bintree day
at first harry doesnt see ethne
she sits quietly in one of the church pews
its only as she hears his footsteps that she turns around
her eyes stop still
she stares at him in silence taking in the ravages of time
all the diffidence and boyish charm she remembers have long since disappeared
in their place theres an inner strength and confidence
everyone said how much youd changed
i didnt believe them
harry do i look that bad
trench came to see me last week
he looked a good deal worse than you
harry hes suffered more
that isnt what he told me
she stares at him with quiet pride
may i have it back
harry that isnt why i came
id still like it back
she smiles sadly i have three of them id like four
harry stares at her then takes out the fourth feather
harry im almost sorry to let it go
its brought me a lot of luck these past few months
ethne takes the feather unable to look at him
she stares at it in silence
when did you get back
harry two weeks ago
she looks hurt that its taken him so long to come and see her but she knows she has no right to expect more
im glad you did what you did on your own without anyones help
im glad for you harry
harry i did nothing on my own
you were with me the whole time
the tears begin to shine in her eyes
youve heard our news
ethne nods unable to continue
harry i didnt come here to change your mind
with quiet dignity the most i hoped for and i hoped for it every day was that i could do enough to save the memory of what we had
so that you wouldnt always be ashamed of the time we spent together
ethne is too ashamed of herself to answer him
her eyes drift to a crack of sunlight on the church wall glinting through the stained glass windows
harry what are you thinking
youd laugh if i told you
harry that might not be a bad thing
i was thinking id get up and leave when that patch of sunlight disappeared
so far its been quite resilient
she smiles gently
for a moment theyre the harry and ethne of old
i passed by your appartment the other day
harry surprised when
when you didnt come and see me
she smiles sadly i was in london for the day
it took me hours to pluck up the courage
when i finally drove by your lights were off
harry ive hardly been out since i got back
it was last friday
between five and six
harry pausing id gone to see my father
smiling ironically someone must be watching over us
the sunlight lingers precariously on the wall
it will pass
youll meet someone soon
then you and her and jack and i will sit over tea and chatter politely as if there was never anything between us
harry that wont happen
it has to happen
the tears fill her eyes because i love you harry
and i cant
the sunlight on the wall finally fades
ethne wipes her tears and gets up to leave
as she tries to walk past him harry takes her in his arms
she doesnt resist
if anything shes relieved
they stay like that for a moment holding each other unable to do anything else
we feel their desperate longing but theres a self imposed wall that keeps them apart
ethne pulls away gently
ill take you to the station
harry i wanted to look in on jack
ill leave him a note
considering no hed love to see you
hes staying at the vicarage
its on the way
theyre polite around each other now like strangers
ethne slips past him with an awkward smile
harry waits before he follows her
they walk down the aisle several feet apart
durrances room vicarage glenalla day
durrance sits at a table knotting his tie
theres a determination in his eyes as if the smallest activity has become a battle to be won
suddenly he hears the noise of ethnes carriage outside
his face lights up
he feels his way towards the window
the carriage door takes a long time to open
durrance stares curiously
finally he hears footsteps on the gravel
theyre heavier than he expected
they stop a moment
durrance knows whoever it is is staring up at him in the window
he looks thoughtful now as if he knows who it is
he turns away from the window and finds a chair
he sits facing the door checking to make sure the carafe of scotch and the crystal glasses are within easy reach
the footsteps climb the stairs
theres a knock on the door
he stops as he sees his friend
durrances face has softened from inactivity
his skin seems pale compared to harrys coarse sunburnt features
its good to see you harry
harry quietly impressed how did you know
a calculated guess
he grins scotch alright
ive got to cut down on the stuff
im putting on weight
harry you look good
not as good as you im sure
harry watches his friend taking the carafe pouring two perfect glasses
everything durrance does is designed to show him hes alright that theres nothing to pity
handing him the drink i heard ethnes carriage outside
harry shes giving me a ride to the station
why didnt she come up
harry he knows the question isnt as casual as it sounds i think she wanted to give us a few minutes alone
do we need a few minutes alone
even though hes smiling the air is thick with tension
harry i came to thank you jack
harry for standing by me
if youre talking about the feathers i wasnt there
harry willoughby told me you were
he said youd tried to talk them out of it
you dont owe me anything harry
the wedding isnt for another month
ethnes free to make up her own mind
harry you dont owe me anything either jack
and shes made up her mind
you should trust her judgement
a long silence
durrance is too proud to respond
harry stares at his friend regretting the wall between them
harry id better go
ill miss my train
ill come and see you soon
he finishes his drink and gets up
have another one
harry i cant jack
his voice is softer now more conciliatory
the friendship was the best thing about that place
its the one thing i havent been able to hang onto
its his way of asking harry to stay
harry sits again
ive become like one of those old soldiers we used to laugh at
forcing my stories on everyone
enough medals on my uniform to light up a christmas tree
filling their glasses have they given you back your commission
harry they havent acknowledged me in any way
i suppose it wouldnt be the british army if they admitted their mistakes
harry i dont know if it was a mistake
i was never a real soldier like you
a real soldier doesnt come back in a hospital ship
raising his glass to castelton and all the others we left behind
harry watches his friend down his whisky sensing the guilt and pain inside
harry reassuring him gently you did everything you could
you saw it happen
harry from a distance
i remember the entire british square retreating in perfect order and then these two lunatics charging out to save their friend
he smiles affectionately i remember thinking there wasnt a bullet in the world that could stop you that day
ironically except my own
harry you obviously werent meant to die
you certainly tried your best
durrance chuckles close to tears holding them back
its hard to talk like this with anyone else
they all want to know how many people youve killed but the moment you mention the friends youve lost their eyes glaze over
harry they werent there
a beat do you ever miss the desert harry
harry im glad im home
it was the best time of my life
whenever anyone had a problem they came to me
i never felt so needed
he smiles maybe we should change places
harry isnt sure what he means
durrance tops up their glasses
you remember the first time we led a cavalry charge in public
harry you wiped the floor with me
most of my horses ended up in the bandstand
ethne was watching
harry hesitating thats right
wed met her the previous night at the regimental ball
harry i remember
you were the only one she danced with
harry smiles but doesnt say anything
ive never been so jealous
i stayed up all night brooding
the next day i was determined to show you up prove to her i was the better soldier
harry affectionately you were always the better soldier
and it still didnt make a difference
he smiles wistfully she was the first person i looked for in the crowd and she was staring at you
everyone else was applauding me and she was staring at you
a beat im not sure if anythings changed
harry cant speak
he knows what durrance is saying
raising his glass to us harry
he leans over grinning and touches harrys glass
churchyard glenalla day
church bells chime drowned out by the excited guests
the wedding party has gathered outside the chapel waiting for the bride
theres a flurry of activity as ethnes carriage finally draws up
friends and family run over to greet her
harrys party stays behind at the church door preparing him for her imminent arrival
general feversham and colonel sutch make last minute adjustments to harrys suit and tie
willoughby reminds trench to make sure hes still got the ring
ethne finally emerges from the carriage looking radiant in a white dress
harry tries to catch a glimpse of her but trench covers his eyes as if its still bad luck to see his bride
ethne laughs as she walks past them into the church accompanied by her father
trench waits until shes safely inside before he removes his hands from harrys eyes
harry looks around hoping to see durrance amongst the crowd
his friend is nowhere to be seen
harry smiles at the other guests but he seems distracted as if he knows in his heart durrance wont show
slowly the crowd outside thins until only harry trench and willoughby remain
harry has one last look for durrance still hoping against hope then he nods and follows his friends inside
the noise of the choir fades as the doors close behind them
for a moment were left in the balmly stillness of the churchyard and then in its place we hear the unmistakeable whisper of the desert wind
in full dress uniforms colonel sutch and general feversham work harry over adjusting his collar all set
mock nautical aye sir
thats enough out of you
as they shove him through the door turning back to sutch by the way i must remember to thank you
pause for telling everyone i was dead
ive never been so happy to be wrong in all my life
but i did what i thought was right
a terrible habit
beat raises all kinds of hell
as he heads out through the door with the organ playing the wedding march
the chapel is filled with military men feversham family and friends mrs
adair and a church full of locals
harrys pov on ethne walking down the aisle as beautiful as a bride can be
harry and ethne kissing at the altar joined together as man and wife as
general feversham v
angle on the assembled military men in two lines leading from the church door bellows draw
closeup hands on hilts as bellows swooooords
sunlight glinting off the blades the officers and former officers of the st battalion grenadier guards form a canopy beneath which
harry and ethne exit the church arm in arm to the cheers of their families and friends
and the bitter sweet tears of mrs
as they move down the steps beneath the ceremonial swords
track down the line to reveal the joyous faces of general feversham colonel sutch colonel willoughby and captain trench
as their heads turn to follow the lovers
continue tracking to reveal an empty space amidst the row of officers in honor of the missing durrance
harry and ethne kissing for real
