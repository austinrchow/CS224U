written by joss whedon april its a group of twelve year olds serious and well dressed
they sit on their heels under a sparsely elegant tent small wooden desks with embedded screens in front of them
the tent is on a lawn surrounded by lush foliage
people walk about and vehicles glide quietly overhead
a utopian vista
now that the wars over our soldiers get to come home yes
some of them
some will be stationed on the rim planets as peace enforcers
i dont understand
why were the independents even fighting us
why wouldnt they look to be more civilized
thats a good question
does anybody want to open on that
i hear theyre cannibals
thats only reavers
reavers arent real
full well they are
they attack settlers from space they kill them and wear their skins and rape them for hours and hours in chinese its true that there are
dangers on the outer planets
so lets follow up on borodins question
with all the social and medical advancements we can bring to the independents why would they fight so hard against us
river is a dark intense little girl writing with one hand and typing with the other
typing consists of holding a long wooden stylus and tapping either end down different columns of chinese characters on her desktop screen
she is a good two years younger than the other kids
people dont like to be meddled with
we tell them what to do what to think dont run dont walk were in their homes and in their heads and we havent the right
gently taking her river were not telling people what to think
were just trying to show them how
she violently plunges the stylus into the girls forehead and we flash cut to the actual present a year old river sitting in a metal chair needles stuck in her
skull one right where the teacher had stuck her being adjusted by a technician
a second monitors her brain patterns
the lab is cold blue steel
off the charts
lets amp it up
delcium eight drop
doctor mathias is not instantly likable nor gradually for that matter
a cold man and more than a little satisfied with himself
behind him stands a government inspector observing
and making him a little nervous
the inspector is in shadow but his uniform indicates no substantial rank as does the eagle crested baton longer than a ruler that he clutches in one gloved hand
see most of our best work is done when theyre asleep
we can monitor and direct their subconscious implant suggestions
river starts convulsing mewing in misery
the inspector starts forward slowly
its a little startling to see but the results are spectacular
especially in this case
river tam is our star pupil
the inspector steps into the light
he is rigid cold staring at the girl with no emotion at all
his name as we will very soon learn is simon
ive heard that
shes a genius
her mental capacity is extraordinary even with the side effects
tell me about them
well obviously shes unstable
the neural stripping gives them heightened cognitive reception but it also destabilizes their own reality matrix
it manifests as borderline schizophrenia
which at this point is the price for being truly psychic
moves toward her what use do we have for a psychic if shes insane
i dont have to tell you the security potential of someone who can read minds
and she has lucid periods we hope to improve upon the
im sorry sir i have to ask if theres some reason for this inspection
am i making you nervous
key members of parliament have personally observed this subject
i was told their support for the project was unanimous
the demonstration of her power turns back to her how is she physically
like nothing weve seen
all our subjects are conditioned for combat but river
shes a creature of extraordinary grace
she always did love to dance
he drops to one knee slamming his baton to the floor
as the top pops off like a bouncing betty the grenade flying up over simon and rivers heads and then bursting forth in a flat circle of blue energy that
bisects the room flowing through the staffs heads and knocking them out
simon rushes to river gently removes the probes from her head and swabs her whispering river
please its simon
its your brother
she begins to stir as a noise moves him to the door looking out and removing his uniform to reveal an orderlys tunic beneath
river is suddenly next to him
he jumps a little
a beat as they face each other simon fighting emotion
they know youve come
as a guard looks at a monitor
he mostly resembles a secret service man more bureaucrat than thug
a second man rolls into frame on a chair behind him also watching the screen
simon walks river through the corridor
they approach a pair of double doors
we cant make it to the surface from inside
simon turns suddenly as he hears footsteps people heading at them from the other side of the doors
wo simon find a but river has impossibly scampered up over some lab equipment to the dark top of the corridor where she holds herself in a perfect split feet
against the walls and outstretched hand holding the sprinkler for support
the doors burst open and two doctors pass by hardly noticing the lone orderly
passing right under river
its small feet by feet
goes a long way up and a long way down
one wide hinged window looks in on the hall inside
simon and river approach with quiet haste
they slip through the window
simon shuts it wedges his baton into the handle as the security agents approach
they fire at the glass but their lasers have no effect
wind whips rivers hair about as she looks up to see a small patch of daylight visible ten stories up
sees the sky blotted out by a small ship that hovers above them
angle the ship is floating over the grass of rolling hills the city gleaming far beyond
this facility is well hidden
a gurney sized section of the ships belly detaches and drops down ten stories cables spooling it out of the ship
it comes to simon and river and stops suddenly
he is standing by the window and the security agent is right behind him punching the window with all his might
simon helps river onto the gurney then jumps on himself as the security agent cracks the glass
the two are whisked up in the gurney river on her knees simon standing beside her holding one of the cables stop
the action freezes
the action reverses taking us back to the moment of simon and river on the gurney just before it rises
f t o stop
there is a motionless beat river frozen in that crouch and he steps through what we now see is a hologram of the event
the governments man
well just call him the operative
he is thoughtful a little removed
wire rimmed glasses a suit too nondescript to be a uniform too neat to be casual wear
he is in which is long and bare but for drawers of holographic records a set up for watching recordings where the image of simon and river floats and a
table with computer and chair
the operative crosses to the table looks over some papers
as simons history files down in print and pictures graduation security photo from his medical internship over one lens of the operatives glasses
doctor mathias storms in two security men not the ones from the opening and a nervous young female intern following
mathias looks greyer and more gaunt than when we saw him last
no one is allowed in the records room without my express permission
over this quietly enter the doctor
to mathias forgive me
i prefer to see the event alone without bias
mathias looks at the hologram realizes which one it is
i need to see your clearance
youre right to insist
i know youve had security issues here
he places his hand on a screen as he says it
mathias looks at the readout and drops the bluster
an operative of the parliament will of course have full cooperation
looks at screen im not sure what
i see no listing of rank or name
i have neither
like this facility i dont exist
the parliament calls me in when
when they wish they didnt have to
lets talk about the tams
i assume youve scanned the status logs
river was your greatest success
a prodigy a phenomenon
until her brother walked in eight months ago and took her from you
its not quite so simple
im very aware of that
he came in with full creds
he beat the ap scan the retinal
there was no way i could no no
the boy spent his fortune developing the contacts to infiltrate this place
gave up a brilliant future in
medicine as well youve probably read
turned his back on his whole life
something a good deal more dangerous
have you looked at this scan carefully
at his face
mathias looks uncertain
its love in point of fact
he loved his sister and he knew she was in pain
so he took her somewhere safe
why are you here
im here because the situation is even less simple than you think
eyeing him do you know what your sin is doctor
i would be very careful about what you its pride
he touches the computer screen and the hologramic image jumps to the doctor and simon in the lab mathias repeating key members of parliament have personally observed this subject
i was told their support shutting it off key members of parliament
the minds behind every diplomatic military and covert operation in the galaxy and you put them in a room with a psychic
she read cards nothing more
its come to our attention that river became much more unstable more
disturbed after you showed her off to parliament
did she see something very terrible in those cards
secrets she might have accidentally gleaned
its probable she doesnt even know she knows them
that theyre buried beneath but they are in her
her mind is unquiet
its the will of the parliament that i kill her
and the brother
because of your sin
continuing moving to his briefcase you know in certain older civilized cultures when men failed as entirely as you have they would throw themselves on their swords
fed up well unfortunately i forgot to bring a sword to the air rings crisply as the operative pulls out his sword
the parliament has no further interest in psychics
they represent a threat to the harmony and stability of our alliance
i would put that down right now if i were you
would you be killed in your sleep like an ailing pet
whatever your failings i believe you deserve better than that
the agents move
he slices the throat of the one behind him with true grace thrusting at the second as hes pulling out his gun and pinning his hand
a moment and the dying agent reflexively squeezes the trigger shooting his own arm
the operative pulls out the sword and the agent falls as quietly as the first
mathias bolts but the operative pins him to the wall
he bunches his fingers and jabs the side of the doctors spine
mathias stiffens suddenly agonizingly immobile
the operative steps back observes the doctors rigid grimace for a moment
almost ceremoniously he drops to one knee and holds the blade out to one side hilt to the floor and point tilted toward the doctor
the doctor stares at it in horror as his paralyzed body begins to tip over toward it
the operative turns toward the terrified intern at the door
young miss ill need all the logs on behavioral modification triggers
well have to reach out to river tam and help her to come back to us
no matter how far out simon has taken her we can hes almost startled when the doctors body drops into frame slowed suddenly by the sword
it squeaks down the blade the doctor unable to cry out as the operative whispers to him this is a good death
theres no shame in this in a mans death
a man whos done fine works
were making a better world
all of them better worlds
mathias is dead
the operative pulls the sword out as the body rolls over
as he wipes the sword down young miss i need you to get to work now
i think i may have a long way to travel
he approaches river very close staring
where are you hiding little girl
the noise is sucked suddenly out of the room as we black out
becomes the name painted on the side of a spaceship with the same in chinese behind it
we move away from the ship
the name is on the nose under the bridge
it sticks out from the body of the ship like a craning neck
the body is bulbous with propulsion engines on either side and a giant glowing back
there are two small shuttles tucked in over the wings of the engines
its not the sleekest ship in the verse to be sure
as it hits atmo the propulsion engines take over and she starts to rock a bit noise filling our ears
camera comes around the front at the windows and into the bridge to see the captain malcolm mal reynolds standing and watching
at that moment a small piece of the nose breaks off and goes flying past the window
note the following sequence will take us through the ship in one extended steadicam shot
the bridge is small two pilot seats on either side and a tangle of wires and machinery all about
mal wears the knee length brown coat and boots of an old independent
gun at his hip
hes not unlike the ship hes seen a bit of the world and it left him emotionally at least weathered
right now though hes mostly startled
what was that
hes addressing the pilot wash
flight gear and a hawaiian shirt toy dinosaurs populating his station no old soldier but just as startled
did you see that the ship bucks was that the primary buffer panel
it did seem to resemble
did the primary buffer panel just fall off my gorramn ship for no apparent reason
another buck looks like
i thought kaylee checked our entry couplings
i have a very clear memory of it yeah well if she doesnt give us some extra flow from the engine room to offset the burnthrough this landing is gonna
get pretty interesting
calm suggestion oh god oh god were all gonna die
hits the com this is the captain
theres a little problem with our entry sequence we may experience slight turbulence and then explode
to wash exiting can you shave the vector im doing it
its not enough
hits com kaylee
just get us on the ground
that partll happen pretty definitely
the camera leads mal down
on either side of the hall are ladders leading down to crews personal quarters
the hulking mercenary jayne is coming up out of his bunk as mal passes
he carries a number of rifles and grenades
were gonna explode
i dont wanna explode
jayne how many weapons you plan on bringing
you only got the two arms
i just get excitable as to choice like to have my options open
i dont plan on any shooting taking place during this job
well what you plan and what takes place aint ever exactly been similar
jayne groans no grenades
first mate zoe enters from the lower level
her mode of dress and military deference mark her as a war buddy of mals
are we crashing again
talk to your husband
is the mule prepped
good to go sir
just loading her up
to jayne are those grenades
capn doesnt want em
were robbing the place
were not occupying it
all that plays in the background as we lead mal into the its the communal space of the ship homey and messy
there is food left lying on the table
mal swipes a dumpling from a plate pops it in his mouth as another jolt rocks him and sends most of the tableware clattering to the floor
calling out kaylee
he enters still calling kaylee what in the sphincter of hell are you playing at
the hall leads to the rust brown chaos that is the engine room
working around the engine in a forest of wires sparks and smoke is the sweetly pretty mechanic kaylee
she passes mal with a slightly impatient smile as he stands in the doorway raising his voice above the din
we got the primary buffer everythings shiny capn
not to fret
you told me you told me the entry couplings would hold for another week
that was six months ago capn
my ship dont crash
if she crashes you crashed her
steam and electricity shoot at him backing him up
he turns to see simon behind him
simon is more seasoned than before but still contrasts the captain entirely in dress and manner
he is implacably proper
guess i need to get innocked fore we hit planetside
simon nods the ship jolting again
bit of a rockety ride
nothing to worry about
im not worried
fear is nothing to be ashamed of doc
this isnt fear
this is anger
well its kinda hard to tell the one from tother face like yours
i imagine if it were fear my eyes would be wider
ill look for that next time
youre not taking her
brushing past him no no thats not a thing im interested in talking over with shes not going with you
turning back i hear the words thats final come out of your mouth ever again they truly will be
turning away again this is my boat
yall are guests on it
he heads down a side corridor that has steps leading down to simon is right on his heels as we lead them down the stairs
i earn my passage captain and its time your little sister learned from your fine example
ive earned my passage treating bullet holes knife wounds laser burns
some of our jobs are trickier than others and you want to put my sister in the middle of that
didnt say want
its one job doc
shell be fine
the passenger dorm has a time worn warmth that most of the ship shares
except of course for the sterile blue of into which the two men step
shes a seventeen year old girl
a mentally traumatized sevente
shes a reader
sees into the truth of things might see trouble before its coming
which is of use to me
and thats your guiding star isnt it
whats of use
honestly doctor i think we may really crash this time anyway
simon jabs the inoculation needle into mals arm
do you understand what ive gone through to keep river away from the alliance
i do and its a fact me and mine have been courteous enough to keep to our own selves
are you threatening to i got one purpose here keep this boat in the air
i take the jobs i get which is less and less case you aint been keeping track
he starts away simon still keeping pace
every year since the war the alliance pushes just a little further out towards the rim
makes it a chore for naughty men like us to slip about and keeping you two on board means working twice as hard to avoid the law
means turning down a score of honest jobs
they enter the biggest space on the ship
giant doors sit at the front which will open upon landing to reveal a lowering ramp
catwalks surround the space leading up at the front to the foredeck hall
weve come all the way through serenity
so here is us on the raggedy edge
dont push me and i wont push you
simon starts up the stairs as mal calls to him things get gritty i will keep her from the fray but shes coming
best you get her ready
as mal walks on we tilt up to see the mule a four man hovercraft hanging from chains near the ceiling
jayne and zoe are tossing duffle bags into it
zoe is wash gonna straighten this boat out before we get flattened
like a downy feather sir
nobody flies like my mister
the camera picks up simons feet as they enter foreground on the catwalk and track with them to find river
shes lying on her side looking straight at us
a loose summer dress draped over her small frame
were going for a ride
serenity settles gently down as the cargo bay door opens
the chains are hoisted back up into the ceiling of the ship
the mule floats just above the floor jayne piling in next to river in the back
now river you stay behind the others
if theres fighting you drop to the floor or run away
its okay to leave them to die
river puts on a huge pair of goggles looks at her brother
im the brains of the operation
we should hit town right during sunday worship
wont be any crowds
if fanty and mingo are right about the payroll this could look to be a sunny day for us
captain ill ask you one last time
doctor im taking your sister under my protection here
if anything happens to her anything at all i swear to you i will get very choked up
there could be tears
he peels out leaves simon fuming
kaylee sidles up to him
dont mind the captain none simon
i know hell look out for her
i bring river all the way out to the raggedy edge of the verse so she can hide from the alliance by robbing banks
its just a little trading station
theyll be back fore you can spit
as he stalks off not that you spit
kaylee watches him go a tad forlorn
we see the town sprawled before us as the mule heads in
the town embodies the lives of folk out here adobe and wood mix with metal and plastic whatevers on hand to build with
right now the streets are mainly empty
the mule pulls up zoe hitching it as they speak what are we hoping to find here that equals the worth of a turd
theres peace enforcing squads stationed all about this quadrant
cant use credits out here they got to pay their boys in cashy money
which once a month rests here
something about stealing from the alliance just warms a body like whiskey in winter
cocks his gun shiny
lets be badguys
mal turns back to river
you ready to go to work darlin
theres no pattern to the pebbles here theyre completely random
i tried to count them but you drove too fast
never mind right
we are in a cameras eye view right above the door
the door slams open mal and jayne stride in zoe following and whipping her hogleg right at camera without looking
reverse to see the camera is also a small screen with welcome to lilac on it for the millisecond before its blown to bits
theres maybe fifteen people in the place store workers farm folk and a couple dirt poor kids
its a combination post office general store bank and most other things
hands and knees and heads bowed down
two men who appear to be farm folk rush mal and the others
mal draws on the elder one and he stops dead in his tracks
mals gun is long not unlike civil war era issue but very much new in design
the other tries to tackle jayne which is not necessarily a great idea
jayne clotheslines him so hard he spins right upside down and jayne grabs him by the legs and crack
bounces his head right off the floor knocking him out cold
yall wanna be looking very intently at your own belly buttons
i see a head start to rise violence is gonna ensue
the guy who rushed mal complies along with everyone else
jayne dumps his catch on the floor and rips open his dirty shirt to reveal the purple of an alliance uniform
looks like this is the place
he looks up at mal who motions for zoe to open the front door
she does and river steps in
angle rivers bare feet walking slowly among the hunched over customers as mal addresses them
youve probably guessed we mean to be thieving here but what we are after is not yours
so lets have no undue fussing
as he is speaking jayne is scrambling to the back office finding the small vault locked
shes locked up
river suddenly looks around perturbed
close on a young tough
river looks up at zoe alarmed and silently points to the young man
he is slowly reaching for the weapon in his belt
he finds zoes sawed off nuzzling his cheek
you know what the definition of a hero is
its someone who gets other people killed
you can look it up later
he drops his weapon slides it across the floor
mal moves to the trade agent
hauls him up tosses him toward the vault
zoe and jayne follow
this is just a crop moon dont think youll find what you in chinese the old man punches in the code
what opens is a tiny wall safe
bundles of bills some scattered coin
jayne and zoe are behind the captain peering in
we can retire and give up this life of crime
mal reaches in pulls a lever and the floor opens a six foot hole appearing stairs leading to a corridor all gleaming metal and blue light
jayne peers down as mal addresses the trade agent
is there a fed down there
yall are browncoats hey
fought for independence
wars long done
were all just folk now
calls down listen up
we are coming down to empty that vault
the voice of a young alliance guard comes up from below
you have to give me your authorization password
jayne impatiently fires a burst of machine gun fire down into the hole
mal looks at zoe and they head down into which is as modern as something off the central planets
a short corridor leads to a real vault door that the guard is already opening
behind that door a few bags of the real deal neatly stacked cash waiting to be robbed
we move in on river as something crosses her face
a woman carrying a bucket and her nine year old son are looking at the trading station a few buildings away
did sound summat like gunblast
maybe you aught run tell lawman
she turns and right by her in the shadows is a man
he is hideously disfigured a combination of self mutilation and the bubbling red of radiation poisoning
his clothes are rags his eyes pinpoints of glazed madness
a blade blurs through frame
river screams and flops onto her back pinned by revelation
others look at her concerned as jayne makes his way to her
what the hell is up
you all right
whats goin on
he holds her as she whispers wide eyed
zoe is hauling out the last of five bags as mal talks to the guard holding his gun at him legs good itll bleed plenty and we avoid any necessary
i was thinking more of a graze
well you dont want it to look like you just gave up
to himself every heist hes gotta start yelling my name barreling in mal
the girls pitchin a fit
theyre here or theyre comin soon
he is already loading up with bags as mal thinks quickly
to zoe and jayne get on the mule
to the guard pointing to the does that open from the inside
whah ah yes
you get everyone upstairs in there and you seal it
long as you got air you dont open up you understand
i buh i mal is in his face dark and huge the doors burst open jayne and zoe coming out first mal behind with river in hand
she is freaked in her own space
jayne and zoe throw the bags on zoe take the wheel you see em
anybody see em
j and jump on themselves mal scanning the area as he hands river up to jaynes care
as the craft powers up slowly moving the young man zoe kept from trying to pull his weapon bursts out of the station grabbing the back of the mule
take me with you
get in the vault with the others i cant stay here
its too many
a reaver craft roars over their heads
its nearly the size of serenity
torn apart belching smoke a welded conglomeration of ruined ships painted for war
it disappears over the rooftops
zoes face is set with unhappy determination as she floors it shooting out and leaving the young man in the dust
as they move from him four reavers jump out of the shadows and grab the young man
mal unhesitatingly draws his gun
he nudges a lever with his thumb and a cartridge pops back
mal fires twice
the young man takes both bullets in the chest slumps down dead
as the mule shoots past the last building we see a skiff shoot out from behind the buildings of the adjacent street right abreast of our gang
we see the church as the first ship and an even larger one come to hover over it reavers dropping down on cable lines to swarm into it
the mule and the skiff are booking through the rocky terrain
the skiff swings closer but jayne peppers it with automatic fire and it swings away
there is sporadic return fire
how come they aint blowing us out of the air
they wanna run us down
the up close kill
river is squashed down on her back being very small
they want us alive when they eat us
boy sure would be nice if we had some grenades dontchya think
mal says nothing keeps firing
wash baby can you hear me
wash is in a frenzy of switchflipping prepping for take off
were moments from air
you got somebody behind you
we intercut wash and zoe at this point reavers
were not gonna reach you in time
just keep moving honey
were coming to you
as she lifts off and starts heading toward the others
zoe gets the mule in front but a harpoon thwinngs through the air from the skiff and s nk
goes through jaynes leg
the harpoon grips the leg and pulls jayne goes flying off the back of the mule mal just grabbing him as the harpoon line reels slowly tighter grab on
jayne grabs the mule legs dangling pulled out between the two vessels as mal slams a new cartridge into his pistol
i wont get et
you shoot me if they take me
mal steadies himself and takes aim seemingly at jayne well dont shoot me first
steadies himself for one more
the line holding the harpoon is split by mals third shot
the mule surges forward as jayne drags on the ground
mal hauls him in as river bounds into the front to make room
wheres and river is holding out his weapon before he can ask for it
serenity rushes across the desert floor not much higher off it than the smaller crafts
to zoe get some distance on em
you come to the flats i want you to swing round
gonna try a barn swallow
wash hits the com
open the loading dock
simon moves next to the huge sliding doors at the front hits a couple of buttons
the doors pull open as the huge ramp beyond them opens down letting in a rush of wind and light
the mule reaches the flats away from the rocks
in zoes ear okay baby weve talked this through
talkin aint doin
she throws the wheel and the mule comes hard about fishtailing slightly as it faces the oncoming skiff
dont slow down
as it heads for the mule as it heads for the skiff and serenity swoops down out of the sky bay doors open and comes right up behind it the
mule swallowed by the bigger ship and only its forward momentum keeps it from being squashed as it flies backwards into the bay narrowly missing simon and smashing back into the staircase sparks and people flying serenity tries to get altitude but slams right into the oncoming skiff tearing it apart a flaming portion of the top flies in skids to the floor as small fires erupt from the mule as well simon pulls a lever and jets of c shoot out of the floor
simon hits the button to start the outer ramp closing then runs to the mule
the c stops and he finds river sitting in her seat completely unharmed
zoe is climbing painfully out of the other seat mal and jayne both having been thrown
i swallowed a bug
kaylee runs in to see how everyone is
she goes to simon
are you okay
is he okay
a bloodied reaver pops into frame from under the skiff top
he lunges for mal baring sharpened teeth mal spins and draws fires into his belly as jayne and zoe both fire at the same time
the freak takes too long to go down but down he goes
dies sitting against the s i op
everybody takes a moment to look at each other
we all here
whats going on
zoe moves to the com no casualties
nice flying baby and thats a negative
clean getaway out of atmo in six minutes
set course for beaumonde
to the others first thing i want these bod simon suddenly punches him in the face causing mal to stumble back and simon to shake his hand in pain
you stupid selfish son of a whore im a hairs breadth from riddling you with holes doctor one simple job
shell be fine
she is fine
except for bein still crazy shes the picture of health
wasnt for river wed probably be left there
she felt em coming
you understand me
seems i remember a talk about you giving orders on my boat
well sleep easy cause were off your boat
just as soon as river gets her share of the bounty
well lets not do anything hasty
im sick a carrying tourists anyhow
well be on beaumonde in ten hours time you can pick up your earnings and be on your merry
meantime you do your job
patch up my crew
he didnt lie down
they never lie down
she is looking at the reaver
everyone does for a moment
mal and zoe enter from below
no i think thingsll glide a deal smoother for us without river and simon on board
but how long do you think theyll last
doc made his call
theys as babes in a basket when we took em in we sheltered em plenty
man has to cut loose learn to stand on his own
like that man back in town
they stop by mal is room
i had to shoot him
what the reavers woulda done to him before they killed him
that was a piece a mercy
but before that him begging us to bring him along
vo we couldnt take the weight
woulda slowed us down
you know that for certain mule wont run with five
i shoulda dumped the girl
coulda tossed the payload
and go to fanty and mingo with air in our mitts tell em heres your share
theyd set the dogs on us in the space of a twitch and there we are back in mortal peril
we get a job we gotta vo make good
washenters from the bridge
sir i dont disagree on any particular point its just
in the time of war we woulda never left a man stranded
maybe thats why we lost
shes not happy with the reply
mal climbs down to his room as wash reaches zoe slides his arms around her
once alone mal lets his own disappointment show
he pulls off his holster and drops it over a chair
kicks the toilet closed and sits on his bunk
the place resembles a submarine cabin with charts and clutter ancient maps on the walls
mal moves a bunch of papers off his bunk and a picture slides out
hits the floor and starts moving its a snapshot movie were close on a beautiful woman who looks at us with amused exasperation
behind her is an opulently dressed little shuttle
kaylee are you ever gonna put that capture down
we gotta have records of everything
a bona fide companion entertained clients on this very ship
in this very bed
the picture pans over to the bed which river is bending over and sniffing curiously
inara is packing things up
for one sweet second we was almost classy
you promised to help me pack
honest inara why do you have to leave
inara shoots an uncertain look at the camera and the picture freezes goes back to the beginning
during all this mal has picked it up
he looks at it a moment tosses it aside
looks around at nothing much
i do not get it
hows a guy get so wrong
we see the doors in the floor slide open a second set below
pan to see for a moment the dead reavers face
kaylee is opening the doors with a keypad on a cable
jayne drags the corpse closer to the doors as he continues
cuttin on his own face rapin and murdering i mean ill kill a man in a fair fight
or if i think hes gonna start a fair fight or if he bothers me or if theres a woman or im gettin paid mostly only when im gettin paid
but these reavers
last ten years they just show up like the boageyman from stories
eating people alive
where does that get fun
he dumps the body in she starts the doors closing
shepherd book said they was men that reached the edge of space
saw a vasty nothingness and just went bibbledy over it
hell i been to the edge
just looked like more space
i dont know
people get awful lonely in the black
like to get addlepated ourselves we stay on this boat much longer
captainll drive us all off one by one
youre just in a whinge cuz that prissy doc is finally disembarking
me i says good riddance
he never belonged here and his sisters no saner than one of them reavers
that aint even so
rivers a dear heart and a boon to this crew
you just dont like her cause she can read your mind and everything you think is mean
well there is that
her and simon could have a place here
now theyre leaving us
just like shepherd book
she looks up toward one of the shuttles
just like inara
and here she is moving back and down into frame her eyes half closed in passion
she settles on a cluster of brocaded pillows and we see another head lowering in for a kiss
come around to see its another lovely young woman and that there is a group of ten others watching intently all in saris on their knees
two handsome young men with shaved heads in the back also on their knees
inara stops before the kiss smiling and coming back up
she speaks to the girls we hear only soft music as she repositions the one shes with lowering again showing her the motion of surrender as if it were a
they love you
inara looks out at the mountains
the space shes in resembles a tibetan monastery if slightly more opulent
widen to see she is with sheydra a somewhat older companion the woman whose voice we heard
she hands inara a drink
theyve learned more from you these last months than the rest of us could show them in two years
theyre very sweet
but theyre not companions
youve no hope for them
junk the lot start anew
on sihnon we started training at twelve
years of discipline and preparation before the physical act of pleasure was even mentioned
most of these girls theyre all of good family the highest academic standards control
was the first lesson
and the last and these worlds are not like the central planets
there is barbarism dressed up in the most civil weeds
men of the highest rank who dont know the difference between a companion and a common whore
all the more reason the girls look to you
you came out here alone before the alliance ever thought to establish a house this remote
youve seen so much
youre a figure of great romance to them
d inara great romance has nothing to do with being a companion sheydra
you should know better
im not the one who had a torrid affair with a pirate
inara nearly spills her drink
with a what
its the talk of the house
the girls all trade stories in the dorms at night
have a pirate
in one of the stories you make love in a burning temple
i think thats my favorite
this is unbearable
captain reynolds is no pirate hes a petty thief
and he never laid a finger on me
all he ever did was rent me a shuttle and be very annoying
mutters in chinese a year on his shuttle and he never laid a finger on you
no wonder you left
i left because go away
were no longer friends
youre a stranger to me now
i do love to watch you boil
the stories will fade
and your captain reynolds has probably gotten himself blown up by this time
looking away again yes
that would be just like him
serenity touches down on the crowded atoll amidst a number of other equally disreputable ships
the place is filled with every kind of immigrant culture and shop imaginable
the ramp is open and everyone is filing out ready to hit the town
kaylee is talking to simon who has river in hand
dont talk to the barkers only the captains
kaylee contd you look the captain in the eye know who youre dealing with
a i wish there was
since he doesnt know what to say she rattles on you shouldnt aughta be so clean
its a dead giveaway you dont belong you always gotta be tidy
dont pay anybody in advance
and dont ride in anything with a capissen engine they fall right out of the sky
she turns and heads off
simon starts in the other direction but river looks after her and the others
do you want to stay with them
its not safe
no i fear its not safe anymore
hes heading off and doesnt hear for them
we start on a corvue screen showing a news report
on the screen is a shot of the town our gang robbed now half of it a smoking ruin
that it was a band of reavers remains unconfirmed
the only survivors of the massacre apparently locked themselves in the trade station vault until
during this we come around to see that the screen has a blinking light behind it come through the wiring of the back to look out at the bar with
the word recording in the corner
every screen is a camera even down here
we pick up mal and kaylee heading down into the bar
cutting away from the cameras view we can looks two stories straight down as they go to a close group of dark tables and booths and a second screen playing
in the corner
its not my fault the docs got no stomach for rim living it is entirely and for all your fault
if youd given simon a moment just a moment where he didnt think you were gonna throw them off or turn them in he mightve what
swept you into his cleanly arms
made tidy love to you
they have reached the guncheck where jayne and wash have already checked their guns
it works like a lunch automat mal sticks his gun in a drawer pulls out a chit the q drawer closes and rotates revealing another empty one
a large bouncer with a shockrod watches impassively
as they continue dont you dare joke
you know how much i pined on simon
and him fair sweet on me i well believe but hes so worried about being found out captain didnt make em fugitives
but he coulda made em family
steada driving them off
steada keeping simon from seein i was there when i carried such a torch and we coulda goin on a year now i aint had nothin twixt my nethers werent
run on batteries
i cant know that
i could stand to hear a little more
if you had a care for anybodys heart you woulda you knew he was gonna leave
we never been but a way station to those two
and how do you know what he feels
hes got river to worry on but he still coulda shown you
if i truly wanted someone bad enough wouldnt be a thing in the verse could stop me from going to her
tell that to inara
for a moment mal is too shocked to react
kaylee storms out
mingo is young tough somewhere between a gangster and a fur trader
sounds lower class british or something like it
fanty moves out from behind mingo to reveal that he is mingos identical twin
apart from slight differences in dress they are indistinguishable
cause we dont wanna interrupt
a man should keep his house in order
greets them each mingo
pointing at his hes mingo
do hes fanty
how is it you always know
pulling out a chair feel to do some business
re mal is gang bit crowded isnt it
as you see we come unencumbered by thugs
which means at least four of the guys already in here are yours
ill just keep jayne with me
sir are you sure you dont go
go get yourselves a nice romantic meal
those are my two favorite words
to zoe honey
to zoe its business
they leave and the four remaining men sit
fanty tosses a few coins to a saloon girl who does a little fan dance
angle the corvue cameras pov of the men is conveniently blocked by her little dance
mals foot nudges a duffel bag of money to mingos foot
quite a crew youve got
yeah theyre a fine bunch of ruebens
how you keep them on that crap boat is the subject of much musing tween me and fanty
we go on and on
so im noticing
is there a problem i dont know of
you got of a sweet take kissing your foot how come were not dispersing
our end is forty precious
my muscular buttocks its forty it is as of now
find anyone around going cheaper
find anyone around going near a sorry lot like you in the first instance
angle river has entered is looking about
jayne sees her nudges mal who looks and turns back to business
we stay on her as she wanders around the perimeter of the bar vaguely listening in on mals deal
youre unlikable mal
you got no respect for us above you you got enemies in every quadrant and your ships older than the starting point of time
yous charity cases to such as us
well heres a foul thought
i conjured you two were incompetent sent us out not knowing there were v reavers about
now im thinking you picked us out because you did
that were a sign of faith boy
and it doesnt affect our forty per
danger is after all your business
reavers aint business double dickless
this is all background noise to river who has moved to the cv screen on which is a commercial
its animated goofy cartoon animals and anime style asian girls all transforming to insane fantasy figures as they sing about we push in the light from the cv on rivers
face pushing to extreme close up all noise but the jingle fading out finally that as well just the hum in rivers ears
and she whispers miranda
she turns and looks back at the crowd
what happens next happens very fast
she strides silently to the first table two men drinking quietly and she slams her foot into ones face then whips it back into the others knocking them both unconscious
as people are turning just registering that this girl kicks the table into a card player even as she sweeps a bottle off it behind her the bottle hits a man behind her square in the face a man she never even looked at people are rising fleeing or pushing forward
shes taking out a group of four high kicks and perfect precision two men come from either side one whipping out a knife she does a perfect split grabs his
wrist above her head using his momentum to stab the other one mal fights to get back to the gunrack
the bouncer reaches her and she wrests his shockrod from him uses it on him on fanty and mingo the fan dancer is bolting and river hurls the rod at
her head knocks her cold
on tables chairs under your legs using the room itself to take out every single person there
one man hides behind a wall impossibly she swings her leg around the corner and nails his face
jayne grabs her from behind gorrammit girl its me
she grabs his crotch and squeezes his grip loosens and she spins facing him and flat heels his nose with her palm v twirling into a gut kick that doubles
him over dispatching of another while she cracks jaynes head with a small table somebody pulls a gun and she snaps his elbow causing him to scream out even before he shoots himself in the gut mal frantically wrests a gun from the vending locker as river knocks the other guys gun in the air kicks someone else and then catches it whips it around just as mal comes up with his they are pointed right at each other eta kooram nah smech
and river drops to the ground fast asleep
there is a beat
mal looks around the bar
he and simon who has run up to the entrance are the only ones standing
he looks down at river
she lies unconscious helpless
i think maybe we ought to leave
we see two sleek warships glide silently into frame followed by a third bigger ship
this is the operatives vessel and it is everything serenity is not sleek predatory icy cool
the operative is looking at the maidenhead security feed and river is staring right at him
yes its me
im glad youve finally asked for me
an ensign is revealed looking at a separate monitor we got a pos on a retinal man carrying her out is malcolm reynolds captains a firefly class transport ship serenity
bound by law five times smuggling tariff dodge
nothing here that would the ship
the name of the ship
he looks over at the ensign with a small strange smile on his lips as his glasses are covered by text
bloodiest battle of the entire war
the independents held the valley for seven weeks two of them after their high command had surrendered
of course sir i just didnt there
his glasses stop scrolling and mals military file opens a picture of mal in one lens
if the feds ever bothered to crossref justice files with war records
reynolds was a sergeant th overlanders
fought at serenity till the very last
this man is an issue
this man hates us
first mate zoe washburn formerly corporal zoe alleyne also in the th
career army looks like
shes followed him far
give me the crew registered passengers our captain is a passionate man no room there for subtlety
hes bound to have some very obvious
close on the lens of his glasses
on it is a slowly moving picture of inara
river is still asleep mal finishing chaining her wrists
she lies on her side breathing evenly
mal stares at her a moment then he exits to find the whole group waiting for him sans wash
may i see her
shes still napping just now
and i believe youve got some storytelling to do
were out of atmo plotted for haven
no one following as of yet
were gonna see shepherd book
we got to lay low
and i could fair use some spiritual guidance right about now
to simon i am a lost lamb what in hell happened back there
start with the part where jayne gets knocked out by a ninety pound girl
cause i dont think thats ever getting old
do we know if anyone was killed
i know she meant to ad kill me fore the doc put her to sleep which how exactly does that work anyhow
the people who helped me break river out they had intel that river and the other subjects were being embedded with behavioral conditioning
they taught me a safeword in case
not sure i get it
a phrase thats encoded in her brain that makes her fall asleep
if i speak the words eta
jumping back well dont say it
moo zoe it only works on her jayne
well now i know that
in case something happened
you feel to elaborate on what that something might be
i mean they taught you that fancy safeword they mustve figured she was gonna what start uncontrollably crocheting
they never said what and you never did ask
mal grabs him and throws him against the wall in his face
eight months you had her on my boat knowing full well she might go monkeyshit at the wrong word and you never said a thing i brought her out here
so they couldnt get to her i dont even know how they my ship
my crewi you had a gorramn timebomb living with us
rivers eyes open
what if she went off in the middle woo of dinner or in bunk with kaylee did that give you a moments pause
simon looks at kaylee the truth of mals words hitting him
i thought she was getting better
and i thought they was gettin off
off looks didnt we have a intricate plan how they was gonna be not here anymore
we couldnt leave them now
no now that shes a
killer woman we ought be bringin em tea and dumplings
to mal in earnest mal whyd you bring her back on
mal looks at jayne at all of them
doesnt have an answer
may i see her
mal steps aside
simon enters the locker
she goes woolly again were gonna have to put a bullet to her
river mouths the next words right along with mal its crossed my mind
can i make a suggestion that doesnt involve violence or is this the wrong crowd
v fanty and mingo might be coming hard down on us or the laws
or maybe nobody could be bunged about a little social brawl
we need to get our bearings
i think we need to talk to mr
the camera swoops in at a sparking ion cloud then through the cloud at a barren metallic satellite moon
then further in to reveal a sprawling and completely empty communications complex
giant satellite dishes everywhere
inside we find an unkempt young man
also sleep deprived over caffeinated and kinda sweet
this is mr universe
he is alone but for his mannikin like love bot lenore
hes surrounded by screens computers feeds machinery that looks both ultra modern and long neglected
all the screens play different images its a mediaverse
as he watches the security feed of rivers fight his image becomes a vidscreen
hes addressing wash mal and zoe
we intercut between the two spaces oh this is good
shes beating up all the burly men and im having a catharsis its happening right now you guys always bring me the very best violence
you think youre in a hot place
thats what were looking to learn
is there any follow up a newswave
there is no news theres the truth of the signal what i see and theres the puppet theatre the v parliaments jesters foist on the somnambulant public
monkey taught to say the word monkey lead story on planets
but the slum riots on hera not a what about this
did this make the
and no lawforce flags either i hadda go into the security feed direct
you can do that
cant stop the signal mal
everything goes somewhere and i go everywhere
security feeds are a traipse to access and i wasnt the first one in this has prints on it oh
look at her go
a everyone is getting bruises and contusions
to mal over that so somebody else has been fed this
that doesnt like me too well
zoe you sultry minx stop falling in love with me
youre just gonna embarrass yourself
i have a commitment to my lovebot it was a very beautiful ceremony lenore wrote her own vows i cried like a baby a hungry angry baby
re screen and she falls asleep
which she would be sleepy
can you go back
see if anybody spoke with her fore she acted up made any kind of contact with her
mr universe works the screen
the image rewinds and stops on river coming up to it looking at it
she whispers the word miranda and starts to move away
go back further
he pulls another screen close starts working that one
matching timecodes he pulls up the commercial
mr universe has a third screen showing the commercial as well and it starts breaking down bursts of code showing through
as he does so friends and potential lovers i have good news and i have the other kind
good is youre very smart
someone is talking to her
the oaty bar
its a subliminal message broadwaved to trigger her
i been seeing this code pop up all over last few weeks
and i cannot crack it
its alliance and its high military so here then is the bad
someone has gone to enormous trouble to find your little friend
and found her they have
mal zoe and wash look at each other
do you all know what it is youre carrying
river stares at us impassive as the camera pulls away from her to reveal simon who is cleaning blood off her face
theyre afraid of me
they should be
what i will show them
she starts tearing up breathing faster
simon runs his hands through her hair
its okay its okay
somewhere else show me off like a dog old men covered in blood it never touched them but theyre drowning in it
so much loss
i dont know what im saying
i never know what im saying
you said something
when you were triggered do you remember
the captain saw you say something on the feed
laughs bitterly ask her
shell show you all
show us what
who is miranda
talking to miranda now
nwi she shoots him a look
im not a multiple dumbo
but i think somehow when they triggered you it brought this up this memory it isnt mine
i didnt bring it and i shouldnt have to carry it it isnt mine
dont make me sleep again
put a bullet to me
bullet in the brain pan squish
dont say that
well get through this
she reaches out and touches his face affectionately
things are going to get much much worse
well the captain hasnt tossed us in the airlock so id say were he has to see
more than anyone
he has to see what he doesnt want to
what will miranda show us
and she starts laughing
quietly at first then louder then almost uncontrollably screaming in his face black silence
its pitch black here til serenitys lights throw a hard relief on the rocky wall
she flies in after slow and steady revealing herself to be in a huge mineshaft
lord i am walking your way
angle the ramp lowers to reveal shepherd book a working class preacher and former crew member
he smiles as they come out to meet him let me in for my feet are sore my clothes are ragged
we see the camp a few shacks and a working mine as our group come down to it greeted by a few miners including an eight year old boy that
rushes to kaylee
angle on a cannon mounted at the edge of town
the guy manning it sees them arrive also goes to greet them
we see the gang sitting and eating
comfortable even laughing a bit
jayne presents book with a couple of cigars
kaylee hoists the boy on her lap
look in my eyes lord and my sins will play out on them as on a screen
read them all
mal approaches book on the edge of a rise overlooking the town
mal has a bowl and chopsticks
book is finishing forgive what you can and send me on my path
i will walk on until you bid me rest
hope that aint for me shepherd
lighting a cigar its prayer for the dead
then i really hope it aint for me
its for the men river might have killed in that bar
werent river that did it you know that
somebody decided her brain was just another piece of property to take fenced it right vd up
you got a plan
hiding aint a plan
itll do you for a spell and the folks herell be glad of the extra coin
but theyll be coming
alliance is after this girl with a powerful will
i look to hear the tromp of their boots any moment
off mals look this isnt a palms up military mw run mal
no reports broadwaved no warrants
much as they want her they want her hid
that means closed file
means an operative which is trouble youve not known
i coulda left her there
as he continues we see an image of him watching over the sleeping girl his mind racing
i had an out hell i had every reason in the verse to leave her lay and haul anchor
not your way mal
i have a way
is that better than a plan
you can play the thug all you want but theres more to you than youre ever like to fess
you just think that cause my eyes is all sorrowful and pretty
only one thing is gonna walk you through this mal
sermons make me sleepy shepherd
i aint looking for help from on high
thats a long wait for a train dont come
when i talk about belief why do you always assume im talking about god
w mal has no response theyll come at you sideways
as he continues we see inara stands waiting her back to us in front of the very vista we first saw her before
the operative comes slowly up the staircase stands before her
its how they think sideways
its how they move
sidle up and smile hit you where youre weak
sorta man theyre like to send believes hard
kills and never asks why
its of interest to me how much you seem to know about that world
i wasnt born a shepherd mal
have to tell me about that some time
looking out no i dont
he walks away offering this sideways
mal watches him go thinking
the teacher from the very beginning is standing in front of river whose desktop screen depicts a single dark planet
eight year old river is working away not paying attention
river you look tired
i think everybodys a little tired by now why dont we all lie down
river looks up scared
all the other children wordlessly get up from their seats and lie on the floor next to them
a little peace and quiet will make everything better
she starts to lie down herself right on the grass
vao teacher river
do as youre told
its going to be fine
river starts awake
mal does too shirtless on his bunk
whuh huh nuhwhat
for the third time mal
got a wave
im a bounce it down to you
he pops up turns to the screen as the white noise becomes
reverse on inara on mals screen
we see her from about chest level up
she presumably sees the same
i uh is this a bad time good as any
please tell me youre wearing pants
slight grin naked as the day i come cryin
hows your world
its autumn here
still at the training house
right where you left me
i remember it as nice enough
it is that
what about you
so what occasi the wave
not that to see you aint
well you look very watching both mal and inara on two zoe and wash are secretly at their formal shyness
different screens smiling jayne enters wondering whats up
thank you i
i guess we have something of a problem here
with the locals i thought maybe
you could use a gun hand
im hoping not
but if you were close at all you the crew could take your ease here a while
and thered be payment
payment is never not a factor
i could sound out the crew
this pot like to boil over soon
not right away
well it would be i mean i would like to
kaylees been missing you something fierce there is a general groan among the audience which now includes kaylee as well
oh theyre so pathetic
i miss her too
i even miss my shuttle occasionally
yeah you left a
got some of your stuff in a trunk never did get a chance to drop it off
i didnt look through the
just sundries i expect
inara smiles blandly nods
an awkward beat
well its kind of late where im at
ill send a wave as soon as i can
mal thinks a moment
mal comes up in buttoning his shirt
nice to see her again
we goin in
moo mal it aint but a few hours out
yeah but remember the part where its a trap
if thats the case then inaras already caught in it
she wouldnt set us up willing
might be we got a shot at seeing whos turning these wheels
we go in
how can you be sure inara dont just wanna see you
sometimes people have feelings im referring here to people
yall were watching i take it
you see us fight
the ship moves gracefully over the mountains
were about seventy miles from the training house
and nobody on radar
if the alliance is about theyre laying low
find us a home
ill take the shuttle in closer
zoe ship is yours
do he starts out turns back to zoe
remember if anything happens to me or you dont hear from me within the hour
you take this ship and you come and rescue me
and risk my ship
i mean it
its cold out there
i dont wanna get left
she is nestled in a gorge overhanging rocks all but burying her from view
the shuttle on the right lifts off from the side of the ship and glides off keeping low
a line of young trainees files by in robes and red shawls pulled over their heads one trainee a good deal larger than the others
she is kneeling in front of a statue of buddha lighting a few incense sticks
the room is sparsely lush not as opulent as the shuttle where she entertained men but still beautifully furnished and draped
a lace curtain hangs in front of the light casting its pattern in shadow over everything
including the rather large figure in a red shawl who kneels beside inara
dear buddha please send me a pony and a plastic rocket and mal
what are you doing here
you invited me
i never thought for a second youd be stupid enough to come
well that makes you kind of a tease doesnt it
you knew my invitation wasnt on the level which led me to the conclusion that you must be in some trouble
for a woman schooled in telling men what they wanna hear you aint much of a liar
mal you cannot handle this man
i have to say im impressed that you would come for her yourself
lwi and that you would make it this far in that outfit
i can be very graceful when i need to
ive no doubt
mal sheds his shawl and robe
inara kneels at the alter picks out another incense stick
what are you doing
im praying for you mal
thats very thoughtful
but i mean it when i say youre not in any danger
speak your piece
i think youre beginning to understand how dangerous river tam is
she is a mite unpredictable
mood swings of a sort
its worse than you know
it usually is
that girl will rain destruction down on you and your ship
shes an albatross captain
way i remember it albatross was a ships good luck
til some idiot killed it
to inara yes ive read a poem
try not to faint
the operative moves further into the room
whenever he moves mal counters
ive seen your war record
i know how you must feel about the alliance
you really dont
fair to say
but i have to hope you understand you cant beat us
i got no need to beat you
i just wanna go my way
and you can do that once you let me take the girl back home
give me the opportunity to help you
all i gotta do is let you take one more thing away from me
ive had a lot of things taken in my time
and it may just be that this is one too many
this psychotic potentially murderous girl who cant have the slightest awareness of your protection
this is where you draw the line
well im a whimsical soul
theres a number of lives that hang in the balance here
lives under your care
are they as whimsical as yourself
i got no notion that im being heroical at all
any more than i think youre really just a harmless bureaucrat come to help me out
you move like a killer
the operative is stopped by this
unhappily he continues i have a warship in deep orbit captain
we locked on to serenitys pulse beacon the moment you hit atmo
i can speak a word and send a missile to that exact location inside of three minutes
mal pulls a small device clipped wires sticking out all around it and tosses it to the operative
you do that best make peace with your dear and fluffy lord
advice from an old tracker you j wanna find someone use your eyes
how long do you think you can really run from us
oh a jack rabbit me
sides i never credited the alliance with an over abundance of brains
and if youre the best they got
captain reynolds i should tell you so that you dont waste your time you cant make me angry
spend an hour with him
mal smiles then glares at inara mouthing hey
i need her captain
my purpose and i will gather her to me
the brother as well
whatever else happens is incidental
in the greater scheme
why is it that the greater scheme always makes everything not that great
i want to resolve this like civilized men
im not threatening you
he draws and shoots the operative in the chest
the operative goes down as mal grabs inara moves for the doorway
the operative is on him in a second choke hold from behind
i am of course wearing full body armor
im not a moron
he tosses mal hard against a wall spinning and blocking a blow from inara she is clearly trained in martial arts but he flat heels her to the ground within
mal is going for his gun again turning and the operative kicks him in the face sends him back gun flying
mal gets to his feet and they square off
mal breathing hard nose dripping blood
the operative perfectly poised waiting
no back up
were making an awful ruckus
theyll come when theyre needed
id start whistling
captain what do you think is going to happen here
they come at each other
the operative is the much better trained hes fluid his blows sparse and deadly
mal is more bluster and determination and the operatives precision is wearing mal down
mal punches wild the operative counters with a spin kick v to the head that sends mal to the ground not far from inara breathing hard
he tries to rise again painfully but inara places her hand on his arm
the operative goes to his briefcase by the door pulls out his sword
his face has taken on that remote kind of fascination as he looks at it
nothing here is what it seems
hes not the plucky hero
the alliance isnt some evil empire
this isnt the grand arena
and thats not incense
he turns to look the incense stick burns away rather like a fuse and flashes in an explosion of light and sound
its a flash bomb the operative sails back as everything goes smoky white and the sound dies to a tiny buzz
the operative tries to get his bearings and four armored soldiers are in his face asking him for orders
mal and inara are gone
he motions for the men to follow them
just a flash bomb
inara leads mal who is reholstering his gun down some steps and along a corridor
the sound is still tinny and weird
i had him
deafly loud i think that i was winning
mal and inara move quickly down the mountain
they look to see that mals shuttle has four alliance guards waiting by v it
mal ducks back out of sight pulls a fancy looking grenade out of his pocket
pops the top and hurls it over at the foursome
close on the grenade as a series of bars of light go out one by one counting down grenade
everybody dives for cover
the moment they do mal and inara race into the shuttle mal sweeping up the grenade just as the last light goes out and nothing happens
one soldier turns to look and mal shoots him back down as the door shuts on him and inara
inara pushes into the pilots seat
hang on to something
you sure you remember how it he nearly falls over as the shuttle shoots straight up spinning and heading out
inara stares straight ahead relaxing her grip on the controls
mal is gone
i told you to hang on
in great pain im fine
we are below serenity as her bay doors are closing six little objects floating out of her belly like roe
these objects are roughly the size of pony kegs and clearly home made parts welded together almost haphazardly
they all spark silently to life and shoot off in six different directions as serenity herself fires up her firefly effect and burns away from us
the operative sips tea and rubs his temple
into a com forget the pulse beacon there has to be another way to track the ship get a read on the nav sat
its a registered transport you must be able to locate sir
have you found a nav sat trajectory
weve found seven
the operative looks more unhappy than angry
to himself does he think this is a game
the teacher and students sleep as river as we saw her in the institute older with blood seeping from the needle holes in her head makes her way through them
slowly she walks to the floating lecture screen
on it is the solar system glowing lines connecting all the stars and planets
she becomes wide eyed breathing hard as it pushes in to one system one planet
she looks over to one side of the tent and we see her pov is of the lab
there stand some five older men in formal dress
they stare at her impassive
we see flashes of corpses lying in houses in city streets and a reavers screaming face
and river awakens
a moment to get her bearings then her eyes narrow with intent
we have every reason to be afraid
why cause this guy beat up mal
that aint so hard he didnt beat me up because hes a believer
as inara continues we see fanty and mingo tied to chairs
light spills onto their bruised faces as the operative enters
hes intelligent methodical and devout in his belief that killing river is the right thing to do
i honestly think the only reason we havent been blown out of the air is that he needs to see her
needs to see her why
i would say to be sure of the kill but
i just know hell kill us all to get to her
so no hope of a reward huh
did he mention a deal of any kind
looking at simon give the two of them up
go my way
which you was all ready to do not a day ago
what went sour
cutting them loose aint the same as handing them over
cause the corpse im about to become is having trouble telling the difference
to inara did he say anything about a miranda
what is that
dont know who or what but its on rivers mind
conjure it might be the reason hes after her
you think maybe it poses some kind of threat to the alliance
do we care
are we caring about that
you dumbass hogs the only people shes a threat to is us on this boat
river is near the ceiling keeping herself up in a split again feet against the walls
there is a wire mesh cover to the light and she has bent part of it out is working it inside the lock of her shackles
look we get back to haven in a r few hours time hiding under the shepherds skirts thats a manful scheme you wanna run this ship
small beat well you cant
do a damn sight better jobn you
getting us lashed over a couple of strays
to simon no offense doc i think its noble as a grape the way you look to river but she aint my sister to mal and she aint your crew
oh and neither is she exactly helpless
so wheres it writ we gotta lay down our lives for her which is what youve steered us toward
i didnt start this
no the alliance starts the war and then you volunteer
battle of serenity mal besides zoe here how many mal turns away im talkin at you how many men in your platoon came out of there alive
mal stares at him
dead cold you wanna leave this room
youre damn right i do
he stalks upstairs
theres a quiet moment
this isnt the war mal
mal turns eyeing her
are you telling me that because you think i dont know you came to the training house looking for a fight
i came looking for you
i just want to know who im dealing with
ive seen too many versions of you to be sure
i start fighting a war i guarantee youll see something new
mal walks out into the cargo bay inara following over well get off
river and ill get off at haven and find some nobodys saying that
nobody besides jayne is saying that
inara tries to catch up to mal
i got no answers for you inara
i got no rudder
wind blows northerly i go north
thats who i am
maybe that aint a man to lead but they have to follow so you wanna tear me down do it inside your own mind
im not trying to tear you down but you fog things up
you always have you spin me about
i wish like hell you was elsewhere
jayne is looking at the storage locker door
he moves to the aft hall shuts and locks the door
goes back to the locker and starts to unlock it pulling his gun
no trouble now little crazy person
were going for a nice shuttle ride he opens the door and she is on him in an instant whip blow to the throat the nose he fires wildly as
she jumps on him wraps her arms around his neck and topples him back the crew enters drawn by the shots
mal is first cant open the door
looks in to see an unconscious jayne
the other way
find her and do not engage
everyone piles out the other way
simon remains to look in the window
angle simons pov there is jayne not moving and river pops up right in front of us
he starts then waits as she opens the door
its gonna be oka she elbows his throat viciously
he drops to his knees shocked and gasping as she spin kicks him to the ground
he doesnt move
she looks at him a moment then takes off
mal is throwing his shoulder against the bolted door to the upstairs
he gives up looking around
shes sealed off the bridge
i do not like her there
she tosses him a bolt remover
he starts pulling a bolt out of a panel on the wall tells zoe check the shuttles
she coulda snuck in
he pops the panel off and starts wriggling in among the wires
a floor panel hinges open mal pulling himself up
he moves quietly to the bridge gun drawn
he enters to find river frantically punching up coordinates on a big cortex screen shes pulled out by the copilots seat
she whips jaynes gun at his face never looking at him
a moment and mal lowers his own gun
the governments man he says youre a danger to us
not worth helping
is he right
are you anything but a weapon
ive staked my crews life on the a person actual and whole and if im wrong youd best shoot me now
she cocks the gun or we could talk more
pointing to screen miranda
wits a planet
matches the one from her dream
everyone has gathered
wash is piloting now as they are in atmosphere
river is by simon
she moves restlessly upset
how can it be theres a whole planet called miranda and none of us knowed that
because there isnt one
its a blackrock
terraforming didnt hold or somesuch
few settlers died
to simon i had to show them
i didnt know if you were going to make me sleep
hoarse whisper you couldve asked
re planet wait a tick yeah
some ten years back before the war
there was call for workers to settle on miranda my daddy talked about going
i shouldve recalled
but theres nothing about it on the cortex history astronomy
its not in there
half of writing history is hiding the truth
theres something on this rock the alliance doesnt want known
thats right at the edge of the burnham quadrant right
inara contd furthest planet out
mal nods its not that far from here
whoah no no moving to the screen thats a bad notion honey
i got it baby
show them the bad
she hits some commands on the screen pulls back to reveal a couple of other planets near miranda
this is us see
and heres miranda
all along here this dead space in between thats reaver territory
they just float out there sending out raiding parties maybe a hundred ships
and more every year
you go through that youre signing up to be a banquet
im on board with the run and hide scenario and we are just about
he looks at his monitors looks ahead
the ship swings around a mountain to come into view of the camp
it is a world of fire
every building burns some blown right apart
bodies litter the scene not one of them moving
theres a grounded alliance ship not far from the cannon that shot it down
we see mals face as the sight hits him like a gut punch
the crew pours out even as the ramp lowers going off in all directions calling out to people
kaylee heads for the burning church
she stops looking at the ground by the steeple
there is the body on the ground face down
the child she played with at dinner
kaylee stares at first uncomprehending
angle mal moving in the other direction approaches the cannon jayne behind him
he stops and sees book lying by the cannon torn up badly from the waist down
to jayne get the doc
he moves to the shepherd grabs his searching hand
wont go far
shouldntve been you
im so sorry it was
they shouldve hit us
they shouldve hit me
that crossed my mind
i shot him down i seen
i killed the ship
that killed us
very christian of me
you did whats right
not unkindly coming from you that means
ah im long gone
docll bring you round
i look to be bored by many more sermons fore you slip dont move cant
order me around boy
im not one of your crew
yes you are
book coughs up blood grabbing mal
urgent almost angry
its on you now
all this death this shit
you have to find a course
this cant mean nothing
you have to
come on keep it up book grabs mals face talks as though replying to something i dont care what you believe
whatever you have to
his breathing becomes laboured
his hand slips away his blood leaving a distinct print on mals face
jayne and simon run up simon slowing down going to the e hes dead
zne aza r
r them as jayne looks around him mal still fixed on book
how come they aint waiting
they knowd we was coming how come they only sent one
zoe realizes the answer turns to wash
get on the cortex
wave the sanchez brothers li shen anyone whose ever sheltered us after a heist
tell them to get out
get out now
every cortex screen is on each looking at a different place
every one shows fire destruction or the snow of an interrupted signal
mal stands alone amidst the screens saying nothing
after a long moment all of the screens hitch the images replaced by identical images of the operative
he looks solemn
v im sorry
but i cannot let you hide and i cannot let you run
and we wish for another way
dont talk at me like a righteous man
you are a killer of children
when god wanted pharaoh to release his people from bondage you know the story
he didnt ask
he sent his plagues down upon egypt
thats me captain
the path to peace is paved with corpses
its always been so
so me and mine got to lie down and world
im not going to live there
how could you think theres no place for me there any more than there is for you
malcolm im a monster
what i do is evil ive no illusions about it
but it must be done
do you know why
its not my place to ask
you will never see river tam
im telling you this
but youll keep her close now and when i blow serenity out of the air this will be ended
youre so terribly out of your depth captain
your old boat cant take the pressure
she aint buckled yet
and the only reason youre talking such a lot is you cant get a fix on us
yes your scramblers code is too old for our seekers
you love that yes
the small triumph over modernity
you really are the noble savage
nobody ever calls me noble
but thats whats going to kill you malcolm
it confuses your text which is self interest
only many i know who still bel i eved in sin just died by your hand
what do you believe in
not a solitary thing
if that were true youd be nothing more than a reaver
something changes in mals expression
but then maybe youre not that far from mal flicks a switch and every screen goes dark
mal comes striding out where the crew have been gathering bodies laying blankets over them
get these bodies together
we got time for gravedigging
zoe you and simon are gonna rope v em together
five or six of em
i want them laid out on the nose of our ship
are you insane
what do you mean the bodies
kaylee i need you to muck the reactor core just enough to leave a trail and make it read like were flying without containment not enough to fry us
these people are our friends kaylee you got a days work to do and two hours to do it
mal contd turns from her jayne you and wash hoist up that cannon mount
goes right on top
piece or two of the other ship stick it on
any place you can tear hull without inner breach do that too
looking around and were gonna need paint
were gonna need red paint
getting it sir
do you really mean to turn our home into an abomination so we can make a suicidal attempt at passing through reaver space
i mean to live
i mean for us to live
the alliance wont have that so we go where they wont follow
v gods balls theres no way were going out there
and everybody save river is talking at once whats the point of living if you sink to the level of a savage please we should talk this over i aint
takin orders from a man has lost his brainstem mal pule s his in his face steps back hand on his
this is how it works
anybody doesnt wanna fly with me anymore this is your port of harbour
theres a lot of fine ways to die
im not waiting for the alliance to choose mine
he walks through the group toward the smashed cockpit of the alliance fighter
struggling to get out is the badly wounded pilot
he sees mal coming and raises his hands in surrender
mal shoots him in the head turns back
i mean to confound those killers and take my shot at getting to miranda maybe finding out what all im dying for
thats my theme now
so i hear a word out of any of you that aint helping me out or taking your leave i will fucking shoot you
he grabs a body drops it at zoes feet as he heads toward the ship
get to work
close on the bodies as they burn flames passing over them and suddenly flickering out as dark falls
they are patches of leathered flesh stretched over bone monsters screaming soundlessly in the nothing of space
we arm past them to the windows of the bridge looking in at mal watching with zoe behind and wash at the helm
and we pull back out to see the whole of serenity for the first time it is hardly recognizable
charred corpses on the nose cannon atop with a space suited corpse draped within long scars welded on parts and war paint
the trail of green light burns out with sporadic bursts of vapor
it looks for all the world like a reaver ship
mal comes down the stairs to the catwalk
he hesitates then steps into the shuttle
its dark in here
mal stands with his back to the door no light on his face shaking
not crying but overcome
he looks up shes in the corner looking through that trunk of hers hands on a long oilcloth wrapped around something
didnt see you
i figured that
anything of use in there
she puts it down and crosses to the bed
he sits by her
you dont have to stay in the shuttle you know
theres empty rooms if you wanna sleep awhile
you think anyones set to sleep
simons portioning out overdoses of morphine just in case
looking around did you really miss this place
rueful smile sometimes
not so much right now
he doesnt look at her when he asks why did you leave
site does lo e at t m why didnt you ask me not to
dissatisfied mal rises
i uh id better go check on the vw crew
see how the inevitable mutiny is coming along
they both want to say more
serenity flies silent
the group make their way toward the bridge
those close enough to get a view out the window are looking freaked those already on the bridge are stock still
pressed up against the glass of the window is river just staring
reverse to see an armada
the black sky is filled with what must be ninety ships in a vague cluster as serenity breaks frame headed toward them
most of them hang still in the air
some move swimmingly about
some turn in gentle drifts as though looking around
bridge continuing they all wait tensed up as they approach the armada
and arrive moving slowly through the ranks of ships
serenity passes a large bizarrely shaped ship
it turns as though watching her
but lets her pass
another minute and serenity is through the armada headed for the small planet just beyond
the operative stares blankly at the ensign
the ensign just looks uncomfortable
kaylee simon and river have left the bridge
the clouds fog the windows so nothing below is visible
every reading im getting says normal
oceans land masses
no tectonic instability or radiation
yeah but no power either
nothing at all
might be a beacon but its awful weak
as she touches down filling the frame
after a moment mal zoe and jayne emerge from the airlock in full suits armed
zoe reads a handheld scanner
levels check pressure
if theres anything wrong the scanner isnt reading it
mal pulls off his helmet
breathes looking around him
well something sure as hell aint right
wider angle theyre in a city
gleaming metal spread out for miles in every direction
portions decimated by fires long since cold others overgrown with weeds but mostly intact
but silent as if trapped in amber
ai n lt the settlement
we flew over at least a dozen cities just as big
why didnt we hear about this
beacons up ahead
out of their suits now mal zoe and jayne take point as the entire crew walks along the street looking about them
she moves rapidly gun out to face down on the ground clothes tattered
she examines it as mal approaches waving the others back
no entry wound fractures
got another one
angle jayne is by a downed hovercraft
inside are three skeletons two grown ups and a small child
clothes in better condition and again no sign of violence
theys all just sittin
angle river is quietly becoming more and more upset
close on kaylee walks in front of an office building staying away from the cars as she hears couple more here
orpse of aman is pressed up against the glass wall right behind her
mouth open skin dead blue terribly skinny
a thing to haunt
seeing it kaylee
come this way
dont but she looks gaaaaaaoh god and steps back horrified as the others approach
its an office
about half the employees are there in chairs or on the ground all in the same state as the first fellow
we see angles of the corpses as the gang evaluates
how come theyre preserved
place mustve gone hermetic when the power blew
very upset whatre they doing
whats everybody doing
theres no discoloration nobodys doubled over or showing signs of pain
theres gasses that kill painless right
but they didnt fall down
none of them
they just lay down
more than anything it looks like starvation
anybody want to bet theres plenty of food around
they just lay down
they notice river now in the middle of the street keening
she drops to her knees clutching her head
as she speaks we see as she sees flashes bodies
in homes in piles an entire world gently dead
make them stop theyre everywhere every city every house every room theyre all inside me i can hear them all and theyre saying nothing
please get them up
please god make me a stone
shes starting to damage my calm
jayne shes right
this whole world is dead for no reason
lets get to the beacon
its small landing is easier in cities with flying vehicles
at the end of a short runway tipped and damaged is an alliance research vessel
the gang makes its way towards it
its a mess doors pried open signs of violence but no bodies
the gang walks through it looking around
river pulls away from simon suddenly determined
she approaches a console and a small cylindrical object
she turns it slightly a hologram squawks to life amidst them all
first we see images that resemble the flashes from rivers mind corpses everywhere
we hear and then see doctor caron standing exactly where she was when she recorded this message
as she speaks we see angles of everyone watching taking it in
river silently mouths every word
just a few of the images weve recorded and you can see it isnt
it isnt what we thought
theres been no war here and no terraforming event
the environment is stable
its the pax the g paxilon hydroclorate that we added to the air processors
tearing up well it works
it was supposed to calm the population weed out aggression
make a peaceful
the people here stopped fighting
and then they stopped everything else
they stopped going to work stopped breeding
trying for control theres thirty million people here and they all just let themselves die
they didnt even kill themselves
when they stopped working the power grids there were overloads fires people burned to death sitting in their v chairs
there is a loud bang somewhere behind her she starts gathers herself
i have to be quick
there was no one working the receptors when we landed so we hit pretty hard
we cant leave
we cant take any of the local transports because
the bang again
there are people
theyre not people
about a tenth of a percent of the population had the opposite reaction to the pax
their aggressor response increased
caron contd theyve killed most of us
not just killed theyve done
they made them
i wont live to report this and we havent got power to
people have to know
loses it here we meant it for the best
to make people safer
she whirls grabs a gun and fires then aims the gun at her own head but a reaver is on her knocks the gun away and bites her face she
screams continuously as the reaver tops her biting at her and tearing at her clothes at her skin
turn it off
wash does nobody saying anything
mal walks outside
he takes a few unsteady steps away from the vessel
inara appears behind him follows he holds a hand out behind him seemingly to make her stop but then he grabs her shoulder holds her for support
she puts her hand over his
i seen so much death
i been on fields carpeted with bodies friends and enemies i seen men and women blown to messes no further from me than you
but every single one of those people died on their feet
mal contd or hell running away doing summat to get through
mal i need your help with this
i need you to help me because i cant he looks at her folds her into his arms
brings her face to his not kissing but touching pressing into each other with the urgency of pulsing necessary life
river falls to her knees vomiting
simon goes to her puts his hand on her back lets her ride it out
im all right
she looks at him wet eyes full of clarity
im all right
wash pulls the recording cylinder out of the console
the cylinder is on the table
mal stands at the head looking at his crew
this report is maybe twelve years old
parliament buried it and it stayed buried til river dug it up
this is what they feared she knew
and they were right to fear cause theres a universe of folk that are gonna know it too
touches the cylinder theyre gonna see it
somebody has to speak for these people
you all got on this boat for different reasons but you all v come to the same place
so now im asking more of you than i have before
cause as sure as i know anything i know this they will try again
maybe on another world maybe on this very ground swept clean
a year from now ten theyll swing back to the belief that they can make people
and i do not hold to that
so no more running
i aim to misbehave
there is a beat as he eyes them all
my grandma always told me if you cant do something smart do something right
by way of emphasis he loudly cocks his big ass rifle
mal takes in the fact that jayne has spoken for them all
that the same grandma told you there was an evil dwarf spirit living in your well
she was a fun grandma
do we have a plan
we havent the equipment to broadwave this code but he can put it on every screen for thirty worlds
hes pretty damn close too
based on our orbital trajectories he reached optimum proximity just before our sunset
if we make a direct run within the hour were only miles out
at full burn wed reach him inside of three hours
she doesnt notice the reactions to her sudden clarity shes still somewhat in her own world
still got the reavers and probably the alliance between us and him
its a fair bet the alliance knows about mr universe
theyre gonna see this coming
he takes a long moment his jaw tightening imperceptibly
theyre not gonna see this coming
close on one of serenitys jet engines as it fires up
serenity is taking off leaving the dead place behind
hes talking with mal and wash again very animated
its no problem
bring it on bring it on bring it on
from here to the eyes and ears of the verse thats my motto or it might be if i start having a motto
we wont be long
youre gonna get caught in the ion cloud itll play merry hob with your radar but pretty pretty lights and a few miles after youll be right in my orbit
youll let us know if anyone else comes at you
drop back wide to see the operative and ten soldiers are in the room visible to mr universe but not to the screen
youll be the first
close on the operatives sword as he unsheathes it
we are amongst the reaver armada
serenity slices quietly through the ships as we come around and see miranda receding in the distance
serenity drifts through the armada and suddenly another ship fires up running next to her
the two ships pace each other another vessel coming about as though staring at serenity who comes closer and closer to frame till we see the suited corpse draped on
it suddenly moves its mal
he swings the cannon round and fires at the ship pacing them
it blows fragmenting into burning bits that spiral into other ships causing two smaller ones to blow as well
mal swings around and fires at another ship
in close orbit waits the alliance force at least fifty strong and clearly with high tech firepower
we move in on the operatives ship in the middle of the cluster
as the operative waits with the others
im reading activity in the cloud
into com lock and fire on my command
to himself you should have let me see her
we should have done this as men
not with fire
its the operatives pov the swirling ion cloud as serenity breaks through and heads at us fully reavered out
he looks confused then smiles at the ruse
hits the com vessel in range lock on
bastards not even changing course
as serenity get a bit closer fifty reaver ships suddenly burst from the cloud also heading straight at us
the operative and everyone around him goes big eyed
thats not good
target the reavers
into com target the reavers
serenity suddenly lists hard to port until shes almost upside down the alliance ships fire missing serenity but tagging a few reaver ships none of whom have slowed down mal
is back on the bridge as we look out at the upside down alliance fleet missiles just passing us were too close for them to arm this is gonna be very tight
hey look were upside down
v zoe and mal shoot a look at jayne
to himself i am a leaf on the wind watch how i soar
serenity slips right under the operatives ship and ducks and weaves between dozens more
the reaver force hits the alliance head on and several ships do just that smashing into bigger ships kamikaze style everything exploding the fleet mobilizes blasting reaver ships circling around
and an air war begins a frenzied balletic ecstasy of destruction that the camera hurtles through as ships and parts of ships fly at and past it
she nearly makes it all the way through the alliance fleet before a barrelling chunk of debris which is twice their size forces them to come hard about and remain
in the fray
mal looks out at the chaos
chickens come home to roost
they are suddenly jolted by a glancing blow from another ship wash struggles to control her the hell its okay
i am a leaf on the wind
also panicky what does that mean
serenity makes her way past the carnage and heads down toward the tiny satellite moon
as the vessel shakes clearly breached the operative moves to a door marked dart
he puts his thumb to a panel and the door slides up to reveal a standing almost formfitting one man cockpit
the dart disengages and bullets down towards the surface
as it moves from the operatives ship we see that a reaver vessel has smashed into the main viewshield and the ship is spinning explosions popping silently all over it
she continues down the metallic expanse of mr universes little moon complex sprawling below them
a moment after serenity blows through frame so does a reaver ship
it fires an electronic pulse at serenity and sparks fly
i got no control
sparks and arcs of electricity are everywhere here
kaylee jumps back as she is electrocuted simon runs in and pulls her out slams the door shut on the erupting fires
wheres the back up
wheres the back up
he and wash are frantically flipping buttons the ship whirs to a semblance of life back up reads at
to wash can you get us down
im gonna have to glide her in
will that work
long as that landing strip is made of fluffy pillows
on the com everybody to the upper decks
strap yourselves to something
we can see it a long strip which halfway along becomes a kind of hanger
serenity arcs at it uncomfortably fast
wash is fighting the stick with extreme concentration as zoe pulls out a seat as well straps in
jayne simon and inara pull harnesses not unlike batman the ride seats from the ceiling help the others in
and serenity hits the ground the landing gear folds and snaps under the weight the ship keeps going now inside the hanger heading towards the entrance to the facility slowing
fishtailing and coming about a full one eighty it goes beyond the strip and crashes down into the pedestrian area so that the nose is sticking back out at the runway but the body of the ship is hidden from it
there is a moment of quiet
i am a leaf on the wind
watch a massive harpoon crashes through the windshield and impales him to his chair
its as thick around as a telephone pole
wash has time to open his mouth in surprise before he is dead
she moves to him
wash baby baby no come on you gotta move you gotta move baby vw please mal rips her away and to the floor as another projectile slams through the window
into the wall above them
we see the ship that has fired the harpoons as reavers start out of it
a second reaver vessel enters frame from above about to land next to it
the cargo bay door opens just the little door housed inside the ramp and jayne comes out with his biggest gun
he looks up toward the edge of the runway but no reavers have arrived yet
the entire crew piles out all heavily bedecked with weapons
a small double sized doorway leads to the black room which is the entrance proper to the facility
mal hits a button and huge thick blast doors open from the sides and the top and bottom creating the effect of a square hole getting bigger
the hall itself is smaller than the black room but still has the arrows on the ceiling that point to an elevator some fifty feet away
zoe slows looking around her
he turns to her this is a good hold point we all stay together no
they have to come through here theyll bottleneck and we can thin em out
we get pushed oo back theres the blast doors
i can rig em so they wont re open once they close
then shut em and hide til we need to draw them til its done
this is the place
well buy you the time
to the others move those crates back there for cover and make sure they aint filled with anything goes boom
wait wash wheres wash
nobody but river realized he wasnt there
zoe is dead calm
no zoe he aint comin
everybody takes that in kaylees eyes welling up
move the gorram crates
we hear savage screams from the hanger theyre approaching
mal moves to the door jayne beside him
reavers rush toward them
he turns to jayne
tell me you brought em this time
jayne smiles grimly tosses mal a grenade as he pops his own and fastballs it at the reavers
it explodes in their midst smoke and man parts flying about
mal rolls his a shorter distance then slams the door shut
explodes raining a bunch of equipment and part of a catwalk right in front of the door
in the black room the door nearly buckles from the explosion
everyone takes positions behind the crates
zoe stands calmly her back to the door loading her sawed off
continuing moving back to zoe zoe
are you here
she looks up at him
do the job sir
hold till im back
he takes off passes inara the two of them holding a look for as long as they can
then hes in the elevator and gone
jayne moves over to zoe
cant be thinking on revenge if were gonna get through this
you really think any of us are gonna get through this
he looks back at their army a companion a doctor a mechanic and a more than usually out of it river
a beat and he looks back at zoe with forlorn hope i might
the elevator stops and mal makes his way to the island of screens and machines in the center of the space
the first thing he takes in is that every broadwave port has been destroyed
angle mr universe is lying dead eyes open half draped on his equally still lovebot
a trail of blood shows he crawled from his chair
mal comes close
he starts to move away again and the lovebot turns her head her eyes focusing with an audible whir
she speaks with surprisingly realistic expressiveness and a warped computery version of mr universes voice
guy killed me mal
he killed me with a sword
how weird is that
a short span here
they destroyed my equipment but i have a back up unit
bottom of the complex right over the generator
hard to get to
i know they missed it
they cant stop the signal mal
they can never stop the signal
okay this is painful
on many levels
im not she turns back powering down
a beat and mal takes off
inara is on her knees unwrapping the oilcloth we saw in her shuttle
river is in the corner clutching her head
i cant shut them up
theyre all made up of rage
a bang as a body slams against the door
just stay low
im right here
jayne moves past them to zoe takes position by her
she picked a sweet bung of a time to go helpless on us
calls out jayne and i take the first wave
nobody shoots less they get past our fire
simon moves to kaylee who is shaky as hell
the bangs on the door continue
oh i didnt plan on going out like this
i think we did right but
i never planned
i just wanted to keep river safe
spent so much time on serenity trying to find us a home i never realized i already had
she looks at him with soft surprise
my one true regret in all this is never being with you
you mean to say as sex
i mean to say
kaylee snaps her cartridge home with way more precision than we might expect from her takes steady aim at the door
hell with this
im gonna live
simon looks at her a moment then turns his attention to the door
inara come up into frame with the contents of the oilcloth a bow and arrow which she pulls back with focused grace
angle the door starts to come off its hinges
a panel is kicked in from the ceiling and the operative drops down having clearly entered from a different location
he looks around carrying a laser pistol
he moves past mr universe and lenore the operative turns guy killed me mal
mal has reached it and surveys the situation
before him is a railing and he can look down on the generator shaft
its miles deep with machines rotating and grinding and arcs of electricity ricochetting around it
on the other side is a platform with the broadwave console sitting behind a clear plastic partition
cables and chains run along the ceiling around a series of ladder rungs
hard to get to
thats a fact
lwi the door is pried partially open enough for one reaver to squeeze through and charge
zoe stands up and shoots him in the head
he arcs back hard as the second comes zoe shoots him calmly walking toward the door zoe
but she is in a trance and we see beneath the calm to the bubbling magma of rage that keeps her firing single shots each one a kill till five
men down and shes out of ammo
the sixth comes at her swinging a blade and she blocks the precision of military training still in her as she flips him wresting the blade free and swinging it
down out of frame bringing it up bloody swinging again as the door bursts open and shes rushed from behind but jayne totes an automatic sprays killing fire on the lot moving forward himself zoe
get yer ass back in the line
voi she looks up almost confused and one of jaynes targets comes back off the ground and slices at her back with a blade she screams as he cuts deep
and an arrow lodges in his neck
inara pulls up a fresh arrow shaking only slightly
mal is on the railing reaching for the rungs on the ceiling just above him
he can almost get them one wrong move and he pitches into the jaws of death
a laser shot nails him in the lower back he arches legs sliding off the rail he falls and hits the rail with the backs of his legs flipping painfully
onto his face as he falls mercifully back onto the platform
the operative comes around some equipment for a closer shot as mal gets shakily up
in pain shot me in the back
made you angry have i
i s theres a lot of innocent people in the air being killed right now
you have no idea how true that is
theres no wise ass attitude in him now
they stand facing off at ten paces
i know the secret now
the truth that burned up river tams brain and set you after her
and the rest of the verse is gonna know it too
cause they need to
you really believe that
you willing to die for that belief
the operative raises his gun but mal is the quickdraw master shoots the gun out of the operatives hand and gets two hits to the chest armored before he makes
it to cover
of course that aint exactly plan he drops out his cartridge and slams another in
the operative hides behind some machinery
tries to peek out at mal and more shots send him scrambling back to cover
mal holsters his gun and jumps for the rung above him starts going hand over hand to the island moving as fast as he can
the operative sees his moment dives for his gun but its been ruined by mals shot
he looks over at mal with death in his eyes
he runs at the railing vaults off it and grabs a chain it snaps and he swings grabbing another
he reaches mal and double kicks him from behind mal flies off the rung but grabs a chain he tries to kick at the operative but the guy is frikkin
tarzan he climbs up and pulls a lever releasing one end of mals chain mal goes swinging smacks into the wall six feet below the platform
he scrambles up just as the operative swings himself toward the platform from above
jayne is still firing continuously as he drags zoe back to the barricades
simon moves to help kaylee firing now squinting with effort and pulls open the cut back of zoes shirt checks the wound
spines intact just gimme a bandage
simon pulls a spraycan from his bag sprays the wound with a foam that hardens instantly into an elastic covering
there are a few gun shots as well as nail balls and blades from the reavers
jayne switches weapons tossing another to zoe and opening fire oh now youre likin guns huh
he takes a hit in the shoulder grimaces and keeps firing
river watches the gun limp in her hand
kaylee grabs it and starts another round but shes peppered with dart like projectiles
she screams and drops the weapon pulling the projectiles from her inara helps her up pulls her back as zoe shouts everybody fall back
everyone stumbles or is dragged into the inner corridor
inara hits the controls and the doors start to close from each side and above and below
then when the hole is maybe four by four they stop
very last one
he tosses it through the hole
zoe doesnt even flinch from the blast as she thinks
theyre gonna get in can close it
no ones coming back from that
she tries to stand fails
how much ammo do we have
we got three full cartridges and my swingin cod
inara is by the elevator pounding for it to come
lift isnt moving
when they come try to plug the hole with em
kaylee cries out and simon moves to her
im starting to lose some feeling here
i think theres something in them darts they throwed at me
im gonna give you something to counteract the he stands looking around him
his bag is over by zoe
the bullet takes him in the belly everything suddenly moving very slowly as he spins slightly one foot lifted a confused expression on his face then speeding right back up
as he slams down on his back gasping for air
rivers mouth opens in a scream she doesnt make
blood spreads from simons belly
inara rushes to him grabs cloth and puts pressure on the wound puts simons hand on it
keep pressure here
and a shot of calaphar for kaylee
she is by his side takes his hand
she has a kind of serenity to her like she understands something now
the lights go out
everyone looks about them
jayne fires again but all the sound has bled out save these two
i hate to
you take care of me simon
youve always taken care of me
she stands as the emergency lights come on giving her face an unearthly glow as she looks down at him
shes running so fast nobody has time to react til she dives through the hole in the doors then simon screams her name the scream following us back into the
black room where river lands in a perfect roll comes up in a room full of reavers
without a moments hesitation she makes it to the panel gets the doors closing
she dodges a blade but a blow to the back of the head shakes her
she weaves around a couple of reavers to get to the closing doors but at the last second her ankle is grabbed and pulled out from under her
the last thing we see is her being dragged back as they swarm over her
angle the blast doors as they shut with a shuddering rlung
mal gets up the chain to the platform
the operative is on mal before he gets his footing tackles him as mals gun goes skittering over the edge into oblivion
there is a railing here or mal would go over as well but he comes back with a couple of hammer blows gets the operative off him
they square off mal stumbling back into a tool chest knocking over tools and computer parts
the operative reaches behind him and pulls his sword gracefully from the holster under his jacket
mal produces his weapon a tiny screwdriver
he hurls a toolbox at the operative and rushes him gets inside sword range and tries for the neck with the screwdriver the operative blocks it and works the sword
point against the edge of mals stomach
starts pushing slowly despite mals resistance and breaks skin
mal looks at the operative a moment and the sword slides all the way through mals belly
mals eyes go wide
you know what your sin is malcolm
shaky smile aw hell im a fan of all seven
he headbutts the operative viciously then punches him so hard he staggers back losing his grip on the sword
the operative responds with a spin kick mal holds up the screwdriver and the operative swings his foot right into it gasping as mal pulls the screwdriver and leg its
stuck in back as he rockets his fist into the operatives chin
the operative goes down hard dazed as mal grabs the sword still in his belly
but right now
he pulls the sword out grimacing
holds it over the operative
the smile gone
vao im gonna have to go with wrath
he stabs down at his foes face but the operative rolls out of the way kicks mal from the ground and is up in a second grabbing mals sword hand
the sword drops and punching him repeatedly in his stomach wound
the gang is subdued because they are all of them injured and simon is slipping away
jayne looks at zoe
you suppose he got through
think mal got the word out
almost convincingly he got through
i know he got through
mal goes down hard spitting up blood
he sees the sword moves but the operative kicks him in the face
picks him lod up mal too tired to throw a decent punch
the operative spins him and digs his bunched fingers right into the same nerve cluster that he paralyzed doctor mathias with
mal goes rigid his face a rictus of pain
the operative goes near the railing and retrieves his sword
mal trembles trying to move but nothing happens
you should know theres no shame in this
youve done remarkable things
but youre fighting a war youve already lost
he lunges and mal twists gracefully out of the way grabbing the operatives swordhand and pulling it forward while driving his elbow into the operatives neck with staggering force
iwo well im known for that
the operative drops the blade mouth open stumbling back unable to make a sound
mal spins him grabbing both his arms and working his own through them in a twisted full nelson then bringing his arms up suddenly the operatives mouth going wider as
we hear his arms crack
mal drops him sitting against the railing picks up his sword saying piece a shrapnel tore up that nerve cluster my first tour
had it moved
he squats down looks the operative in the face
sorry bout the throat
expect youd wanna say your famous last mw words now
just one trouble
he reaches over the railing pulls the back of the operatives jacket through and shoves the sword through the fabric pinning the operative in his sitting position
i aint gonna kill you
he moves to the console starts prepping it
hell im gonna grant your greatest wish
he inserts the cylinder turns it slightly
it hums to life
im gonna show you a world without sin
he hits send all
the cylinder lights up and the broadcast v begins
here it is projected as a two dimensional image on the clear plastic partition right in front of the operative
there are images first of the city of bodies on the street in homes and offices
image after image jus
t as we saw on the research vessel and in rivers mind
these are some of the first sites we scouted on miranda
there is no one living on this planet
there is no one
mal hits the controls and a ramp extends towards the other side
he begins to cross
never even looks back
on the operative trapped watching in growing horror
close on a reaver in extreme slow motion
face full of fury he is swinging his blade in a frenzy of hate
and a small hand smashes that face so hard that teeth fly the reaver clearing frame to reveal
she is bloodied but not killed
shes as she was in the bar moving faster and more efficiently than anyone can ducking and weaving and gutting and kicking and there are piles of reavers already she
never breaks concentration as she uses their own blades against them throws them does everything in her power to stay one step ahead of or above the mob
she slams backwards into a wall opposite the blast doors and a grappling hook punches through it just missing her
the operative watches the end of the broadcast
we are on his face through the clear plastic so the images projected on it blur right before him the reaver dr
caron and her screaming doesnt stop til something is shoved in her mouth
the gang is still trying to patch themselves together when the elevator doors open
mal staggers out holding his bleeding side
zoe looks at the badly wounded simon is about to give a report and the doors start to open behind her
everyone turns to look those who can feebly raising weapons as the square iris of the opening blast doors widens to reveal river standing alone
she is holding two reaver blades is bloody but unbowed
and the only one alive
we hold on her a moment then the wall behind her is ripped completely away
behind it grappling hooks chained to a huge tractor pull the wall away as through the smoke come some fifteen alliance soldiers who line up rifles trained on our gang
drop your weapons
drop em now
do we engage
do we engage
mal and the others tense up
river turns slowly to face the soldiers blades still gripped
a soldier levels his gun at her sweaty and frantic
others still shouting
basement over the generator continuing the operative sits in silence the voices coming over his com targets are acquired
do we have a kill order
do we have an order
we are close on a gravestone
it is rounded looks more like a bell than a headstone
it is topped by a jar builtinto the stone
the jar is weathered tin at top and bottom but glass in the middle
inside the glass we can see one of those slightly moving photos
it is of mr universe and his lovebot and the name mr universe is carved roughly in the stone beneath
the camera moves to the right and we see another such stone this one bearing the image and inscription shepherd derrial book
the third is hoban washburne
the camera continues moving right but the next stone houses a small home made rocket with pieces of paper taped to it instead of a picture jar
and fixing another slip of paper to it is river
she moves away from the stone as mal does likewise
theyre flanked by the crew jayne inara to whom mal moves simon who stands holding river before him and hand in hand with kaylee
he has a crutch supporting his other side
there is a moment then they all move aside saying nothing
between them walks zoe in a simple white funeral gown holding a burning taper
she stands at the stones a moment then holds the taper to the rocket fuse
stands back with the others
the rocket shoots up into the darkening sky
they all watch its sputtering tail a moment then it it explodes in a series of fireworks
wide on the group as the fireworks go off over their heads
we are close on another explosion when it becomes close on a blowtorch spitting sparks
widen to see zoe is harnessed to the nose of the ship welding on a replacement for the very window the harpoon that impaled wash came through
we are close on river as she works inside a crawlspace just above the engine room replacing wires
some of them run to a computer screen that she checks and adjusts
mal and jayne hold onto the cannon as a crane is lifting it off the top of the ship
close on mal as he watches it go
t f o and here we see the whole ship for the first time harnessed by the wings above the ground so she can be worked on all over
the cannon is being hoisted away from her as a crew of repairmen wheel new landing gear under her belly
kaylee deeply greasy tweaks a part on the engine and crosses to the back where simon shirtless and not entirely ungreasy himself is wrenching a bolt into place above his
a moment looking at him and she cant help herself she slides her arms around his chest
on a scaffold inara repaints the name on the nose with elegant precision
kaylee and simon are just making out like fiends work completely forgotten
with nothing resembling elegant precision they sink out of frame to the floor
a beat and rivers head appears from the crawlspace above looking down at them with detached curiosity
its raining as mal is hauling in the last of the repair equipment
the camera moves around him skirting the ground of the junkyard till it lands on a figure in foreground standing watching him from some twenty feet away
mal stops doesnt turn
hand near his gun
if youre here to tell me we aint finished
then we will be real quick
the operative stands just under the canopy of the nose of the ship framed by the rain behind
do you know what an uproar youve caused
protests riots cries for a recall of the entire parliament
weve seen the broadwaves
you must be pleased
verse wakes up a spell
wont be long fore she rolls right over and falls back asleep
taint my worry
i cant guarantee they wont come after you
they have a hundred men like me and they are not forgiving
that dont bode especially well for you
giving the order to let us go patching up our hurt
i told them the tams were no longer a threat damage done
the operative contd they might listen but
i think they know im no longer their man
they take you down i dont expect to grieve overmuch
like to kill you myself i see you again
small grim smile nothing left to see
mal looks at him a moment then picks up his gear to head inside
the operative starts away into the rain then stops to look up at the nose of the ship
angle the newly painted serenity standing tall in the rain
you lost everything in that battle
everything you had everything you were
how did you go on
mal hits the button to close the inner doors steps inside as they slide together
glances at the operative unimpressed
you still standing there when the engine starts you never will figure it out
the operative watches the door shut
a moment and he goes
mal stows the gear as zoe approaches
to himself what a whiner
sir we have a green light
inspections pos and were clear for upthrust
think shell hold together
shes tore up plenty
but shell fly true
a beat between them before make sure everythings secure
could be bumpy
she takes off and mal heads up the stairs
mal comes in and runs into inara
jayne passes through as they talk heading down into his bunk
pays them no mind
neither do simon and kaylee in the dining room stowing supplies
were taking her out
should be about a days ride to get you back to your girls
moving past her you ready to get off this heap and back to a civilized life
he stops i dont know
he looks at her a smile in his eyes
he turns and heads into the bridge
mal eases himself into his seat
takes a moment to adjust one of washs dashboard dinosaurs then looks to his left
you gonna ride shotgun help me fly
v river is in the copilots seat looking intently at the screens and buttons
thats the plan
think you can work out how to get her in the she is flipping switches without even looking as the ship hums to life
her engines fire up and tilt
she lifts gently off the ground
mal looks slightly only slightly nonplussed
okay clearly some aptitude for the
but it aint all buttons a and charts
you know what the first rule of flying is
well i suppose you do since you already know what im about to say
but i like to hear you say it
he looks out at the rain on his windows at his screens taking her up as he says love
you can learn all the math in the verse but you take a boat in the air you dont love shell shake you off just as sure as the turning
love keeps her in the air when she oughta fall down tells you shes hurting fore she keens
makes her a home
river also looks out at the sky
storms getting worse
well pass through it soon enough
as we shoot up with her through sheeting rain towards the top of the sky
we are looking down on the stormclouds as serenity bursts out of them comes at us flared by the sun behind the planet as she passes us her firefly effect
lighting up about to shoot off into the heavens there is a spark and a piece of paneling pops off whips at camera blacking out the frame
what was that
