href b b screenplay by david koepp based on the novel by michael crichton a foot luxury yacht is anchored just offshore in a tropical lagoon
the beach is a stunning crescent of white sand at the jungle fringe utterly deserted
miles southeast of nublar two ship hands dressed in white uniforms have set up a picnic table with three chairs on the sand and are carefully laying out luncheon service
fine china silver crystal decanters with red and white wine
paul bowman fortyish sits in a chair off to the side reading
bowman painfully thin with the perpetually surprised look of a woman whos had her eyes done more than once supervises the settings of the table
she looks up and sees a little girl cathy seven or eight years old wandering off down the beach
dont wander off
cathy keeps wandering
bowman contd cathy come back
you can look for shells right here
cathy gestures pretending she cant hear
eyes still in his book leave her alone
what about snakes
theres no snakes on a beach
let her have fun for once
cathy keeps wandering away muttering to herself as her parents quarreling voices fade in the distance
please be quiet please be quiet please be quiet
rounding a curve in the beach her parents disappear from view behind her
a rustling sound draws her attention and she turns toward where the thick jungle foliage gives way to the sand
a large bush maybe twelve feet tall is moving its branches swaying and shaking
curious cathy walks up to the bush which abruptly stops moving
a small lizard like animal dark green with brown stripes along its back steps out from the bush
only about a foot tall it stands on its hind legs balancing on its thick tail
it walks upright bobbing its head like a chicken
well hello there
the animal a compsognathus just stares at her
cathy squats down on her haunches
cathy contd what are you
a little bird or something
she opens her hand
shes got a handful of goldfish crackers
cathy contd are you hungry
you want a goldfish
the compy bobs forward a few steps cautiously
cathy contd come on
i wont hurt you
the compy draws closer
cathy holds the cracker in the palm of her hand
the compy gets closer still and hops numbly up onto cathys palm
her arm dips a bit under the weight but its not that heavy and she holds it up easily
it bobs its head scarfs up the goldfish and eats it
enchanted cathy breaks into an enormous grin and returns her hand calling back over her shoulder
cathy contd mom
you gotta come see this
i found something
she turns back
thirty more compys have come out onto the sand
theyre standing there bobbing anxiously staring at her from a few feet away
cathys smile fades
she turns her head slowly to the right
twenty more compys have come in from that side forming a semi circle bobbing and chipping as they surround her
cathy contd terrified what do you guys want
the table is set
bowman calls out
lunch is ready
from around the curve of the beach a flock of birds bolts from the jungle trees as cathys shrill screams suddenly pierce the air
she takes off running down the beach mr
bowman leaps out of his chair and follows and all available deck hands race off to help kicking up geysers of sand behind them
bowman stops dead in her tracks when she rounds the bend in the beach
we dont see what she sees but we hear the frenzied squeaking of the strange compys
bowman and the hands race past her to help cathy as mrs
bowman lets loose a horrified slack jawed scream her mouth a perfect oval
bowmans screaming face dissolves slowly over the yawning face of a bored corporate executive twenty other executives sit around a conference table in the boardroom of a monied corporation
all are in expensive suits most are over sixty
there are rows of backbenchers too whispering in their lawyers who sit behind their clients whispering in their ears
empty coffee cups and fast food containers on the table hint that everyones been here a long time
a familiar voice resounds through the boardroom as we move down the long table pat the grim faces of the board members
the hurricane seemed like a disaster at the time but now i think it was a blessing natures way of freeing those animals from their human confines
of giving them another chance to survive but this time as they were meant to without mans interference
the source of the voice is john hammond the founder of ingen and creator of jurassic park
but hes not in the room
his image is on a closed circuit tv screen which has been wheeled up to the end of the table
and he doesnt look good
hes terribly infirmed propped up in bed his face pale and drawn medical equipment beeping around him
hammond contd there are some corporate issues that are not about the bottom line
we have so much still to learn about those creatures
a whole world of intricate interlocking behaviors vanished everywhere except for site b
lets not do what is good for more men at the expense at what is best for all mankind
the chairman seventyish nods awkwardly to the television
thank you john
he turns to peter ludlow late thirties a man with the anxious look of someone who insists the buck stop on his desk
ludlow flips open a file pulls out a stack of black and white eight by tens and tosses them on the table
an accent similar to hammonds these pictures were taken in a hospital in costa rica forty eight hours ago after an american family on a yacht cruise stumbled onto site
the little girl will be fine but her parents are wealthy angry and very fond of lawsuits
but thats hardly new to us is it
takes a paper from the file wrongful death settlements partial list family of donald gennaro
million dollars family of robert muldoon
damaged or destroyed equipment
demolition de construction and disposal of isla nublar facilities organic and inorganic one hundred and twenty six million dollars
the list goes on gentlemen research funding media payoffs
silence is expensive
hes warming up
not a bad performer
ludlow contd this corporation has been bleeding from the throat for four years
you our board of directors have set patiently and listened to ecology lectures while mr
hammond signed your checks and spent your money
you have watched your stock drop from seventy eight and a quarter to nineteen flat with no good and in sight
and all along we have held a significant product asset that we could have safely harvested and displayed for profit
he reaches out to a model on the table and gives it a shove sending it sliding down the length of the table in front of them
its a mini mall version of a zoo
cages hold tiny replicas of various kinds of dinosaurs while boy scout troops and tourists look on in wonder
ludlow contd enough money to wipe out four years of lawsuits and damage control and unpleasant infighting enough to not only send our stock back to where it was but
to double it
and the one thing the only thing standing between us and this asset is a born again naturalist who happens to be our own ceo
well i dont work for mother nature
i work for you
two of his backbenchers distribute documents from a stack
ludlow takes one and reads from it
ludlow contd whereas the chief executive officer has engaged in wasteful and negligent business practices to further his own personal environmental beliefs whereas these practices have affected the financial performance
of the company by incurring significant losses whereas the shareholders have been materially harmed by these losses thereby be it resolved that john parker hammond should be resolved from the office of chief executive officer affective immediately
chairman i move the resolution be put to an immediate vote
do i have a second
i second the motion mr
chairman please poll the members by a show of hands
the chairman signs heavily feeling like a traitor
he cant bear to look at hammond on the tv monitor
all those in favor of ingen corporate resolution c please signify your approval by raising your right hand
it starts slowly guiltily but every hand in the room goes up
ludlow sits back victorious
hammond furious raises his right hand which holds a remote control and points it at the tv screen
it goes blank
sparks fly out the windows and doors of a shed in the middle of a welders yard
scrap iron and steel lies everywhere
somewhere inside the shed a phone rings
the whoosh of the arc welder shuts off
dieter stark a big barrel chested man of forty or so his face streaked with soot and grime steps outside with a cordless phone a cigarette dangling from his lips
he takes a deep drag while someone talks on the other end
he smiles and blows out a cloud of smoke
smoke turns into steam as a subway thunder into a station underneath manhattan
the door whoosh open spit out some commuters and suck up a few more
a tall man hurries down the platform limping heavily moving as fast as he can
the subway doors begin to close but just before they meet the man jams a cane in between stopping them
the man is ian malcolm fortyish dressed in black from head to toe
theres a hard wisdom in malcolms eyes that may not have been theres a few years ago he know what you think and he doesnt care
malcolm finds a seat on the crowded subway car and sits down
he looks awful
he notices a curious man across from his is staring at his
malcolm looks away
the curious man still stares
nervy the curious man gets up and approaches
under his breath shit
the curious man sits down next to malcolm grinning
youre him arent you
i saw you on tv
conspiratorially i believed you
no response from malcolm
the guy leans in even closer
man contd roooooarr
a withering look i was misquoted
i was merely speculating on the evolutionary scenario of a lost world
i never said i was in any such place
he gets up and moves to another seat on the car away from the curious man
as he sits down he notices two other commuters across from him are staring at him
he looks at them
they looks away
he pulls the collar of his coat up tight around him
nowhere to hide
a uniformed butler has a question whom shall i tell mr
hammond is calling
malcolm stands in the foyer of an expensively decorated park avenue apartment
ian malcolm a door opens and a little dog comes yapping out of the back
it bounds straight at malcolm growling jaws snapping
it lunges and malcolm bats it away with one swift swing of his cane
the dog rolls across the floor and slinks away whining
the butler looks at malcolm disapprovingly
not an animal lover
malcolm enters a darkened bedroom
john hammond lies in the bed we saw earlier on the other side of the room medical equipment has been disguised as well as possible among the furniture and flowers
but the sheer abundance of it tells us that whatever has stricken him is going to win this battle
dont linger in the doorway like an ingenue come in come in
malcolm steps further into the room
hammond contd its good to see you
it really is
hows the leg
when you have a lot of time to think its funny who you remember
its the people who challenged you
it is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning
i never told you how sorry i was about what happened after we returned
noticing hammonds deteriorated condition malcolm finds it hard to sustain anger
i didnt know you werent well
its the lawyers
the lawyers are finally killing me
they do have motives
why did you want to see me
your message said it was urgent
you were right and i was wrong
did you ever think youd hear me say that
instead of observing those animals i tried to control them
i squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives
not their lives as man would have them behind electric fences but in the wild
behavior in their natural habitat the impossible dream of any paleontologist
i could have had it but i let it slip away
pause thank god for site b
malcolm just looks at him for a long moment
a spark in his eye well
didnt it all seem a trifle compact to you
what are you talking about
the hatchery in particular
you know my initial yields had to be low far less than one percent thats a thousand embryos for every single live birth
genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation not the spotless little laboratory i showed you
i dont believe you
isla nublar was just a showroom ian something for the tourists site b was the factory floor
we built it first on isla sorna eight some miles from nublar
no no no no no no
after the accident at the park a hurricane wiped out our facility on site b
we had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves
and they did
for four years ive fought to keep them safe from human meddling now i want you to go there and document them
are you out of your mind
i still have nightmares my reputations a joke my leg is shot you think i need more of that
it would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen
hammonnd picks up a thick file folder from the night table near to him and open it on his lap
inside there are memos charts maps and photographs
ive been putting this together for over a year
i have personal suggestions for your entire team phone numbers contact people
they wont believe you about what theyre going to see so dont bother trying to convince them
just use my checkbook to get them there
ill fund your expedition through my personal accounts as such money and equipment as you need but only if you leave immediately
if we hesitate all will be lost
youll need an animal behaviorist someone with unimpeachable credentials
i believe you already know sarah harding
shes got theories about parenting and nurturing among hunter scavengers i bet shed be dying to prove on a scale like this
if you convince her to go itll be a major coup
when she publishes the scientific community must take it seriously
malcolm just shakes his head flipping through the file sadly
your documentation you should use forensic photographic methods hasselbladt still cameras high definition video
when the trick photography analysts take your evidence apart make it impossible for them to say there was enhancement or computer graphic imaging
oh this is very important avoid the island interior at all costs
stick to the outer rim
everything you need to know can be found there
vindication lies on the outer rim
malcolm gently closes the file and pushes it back to hammond
im not going john
fatigue returning ian you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world
i cant walk so far and leave no footprints die and leave nothing with my name on it
i will not be known only for my failures
and you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic
youre too smart
youe too proud
this is a chance at redemption
for both of us
theres no time to equivocate we must seize it now before he stops staring over malcoms shoulder
peter ludlow still in his overcoat is standing in the doorway to the bedroom
he looks back and forth from hammond to malcolm suspiciously
hello uncle john
malcolm doesnt answer
he seems to know ludlow and dislikes him
ludlow contd did i interrupt something
malcolm turns back to hammond
find someone else
in the foyer ludlow hands malcolm his coat just a trifle rudely and shepherds him to the door
so you two were just uh telling old campfire stories were you
do me a favor
dont pretend for a second that you and i dont know the truth
you can convince time magazine and the skeptical inquirer of whatever you want but i was there
you signed a non disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw
you violated that agreement
you cost me my livelihood
that on which i relied to support my children
if your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to hard copy i hardly see how i am to i didnt tell anything i told the
you version of it
there are no versions of the truth
this isnt a corporate maneuver its my life
we made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries
it was a payoff and an insult
ingen never ingen is my livelihood dr
malcolm and i will jealously defend its interests
people will know what i want them to know when i want them to know it
ludlow tosses something to malcolm hard
it sails across the foyer upright and malcolm reaches out and catches it with one hand
its his cane
ludlow contd dont forget that
malcolm stares at him for a long moment
finally he turns and walks away
but he does not out of the apartment
instead he walks directly past ludlow crosses the living room and steps back into hammonds bedroom closing the door behind him with a determined click
hammond looks up hopeful as malcolm comes back into the room and walks over to his bed
he reaches down and picks up the file folder
do you have a satellite phone
roland tembo late sixties skin like leather and the diamond hard look of a cobra sits at a table in the middle of an african cafe bar in mombassa
its daytime and the place is half full mostly with locals but there are a few obnoxious tourists too americans on safari who somehow found the local handout
theyre a noisy bunch but roland tunes them out calmly eating his lunch and drinking a beer while he reads a book eyeglasses hanging low on his nose
roland suddenly stops reading and furrows his brow
he looks up
he sniffs the air once then smiles and calls out a persons name
he turns around
ajay ah jay sidhu a wiry east indian in his late forties is standing behind him caught trying to sneak up
delighted how did you know
taps his nose that cheap aftershave i send you every christmas you actually wear it
sit down sit down what brings you to mombassa
tell me roland when was the last time you answered your phone
last time i plugged it in i suppose
behind them the group of tourists all men laughs loudly
one of them the most obnoxious tourists berates the waitress
i got a call from a gentleman whos going to costa rica or thereabouts
if hes to be believed its a most uh unique expedition
and very well funded
well im a very well funded old son of a bitch
the most obnoxious tourist bellows for the waitress
his buddies laughs
roland throws a glance annoyed
we always had great success together you and i
just a little bit too much i think
how do you mean
a true hunter doesnt mind if the animal wins
if it escapes
but there werent enough escapes from you and me ajay
ive decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death
maybe i just feel too close to it my the waitress comes to the tourists table and the most obnoxious tourist actually paws her ass
roland is out of his chair in a second
roland contd to ajay excuse me
romand walks over to the tourists table says something to the waitress in the local dialect and she walks away behind him
he stares down at the most obnoxious tourist
roland contd you sir are no gentleman
is that supposed to be an insult
i can think of none greater
the tourist looks at his buddies and laughs
buzz off you silly old bastard
what do i have to do to pick a fight with you bring your mother into it
are you kidding
i could take you with one arm tied down
the waiter finishes tying a mans wrist to his belt in the back of his pants with a napkin
he pulls the knot tight and the man turns around
its roland with his arm tied down
the tourist stands across from him
i mean my arm
roland punches him square in the jaw
the tourist reels stunned
enraged he lunges at roland swinging with both arms
roland bobs neatly ducking the punches waits for the tourist to turn around and pops him thrice in the face
the tourist spins and goes down to the floor face first
a cloud of sawdust and a loud cheer from the locals rise up in the bar
roland drops the napkin on the table and sits back down with ajay
in the background the tourists buddies hurriedly carry their fallen cohort out of the bar
we were saying
you broke that idiots jaw for no reason other than your boredom
tell the truth roland
arent you even interested in knowing this expeditions quarry
go on up to my ranch take a look around the trophy room and tell me what kind of quarry you think could possibly be of any interest to me
ajay just smiles
the african savannah appears in shades of fluorescent green seen through night vision goggles
an animal yelp comes from the left and the green vista sweeps abruptly toward it
the world blurs momentarily then comes into focus on a field of long grass
the grass ripples in a complex pattern as animals move stealthily through it
one animal head pops up above the grass for a split second teeth bared a white stripe between its eyes
sarah harding pulls the goggles away from her face
ace face is the striped snout
sarah is thirty with a compact athletic body built for the outdoors
she loos through the goggles again sweeping ahead of the hyenas to their prey
its a herd of african buffalo standing belly deep in the grass agitated bellowing and stamping their feet
sarah turns to makena her african assistant
sarah contd theyll try to take down a calf
sarah scurries up and over a rock face
closer now they watch as the hyenas rush the herd running through it trying to break it up
makena contd you know we could see everything from up on the edge of that cliff
but the view would no cliffs
into a pocket recorder f headed sough f and f flanking twenty yards
f circling wide east
cant see f
while she talks breathless fascinated by the drama before her sarah continues to creep closer and closer to the action
makena follows with growing unease
f circling north
f straight through disrupting
herd moving stamping
f angling through from the north
shes practically on top of the animals now
makena has a hold of sarahs sweatshirt and is tugging her back at least trying to slow down her progress as sarah wide eyed with fascination creeps even closer
suddenly there is a tremendous bellowing and the grass right in front of them rips apart trampled under the feet of the hyenas as they cluster around a fallen buffalo
they yelp and jump their muzzles bloody
the adults move aside making room as the hyena pups come forward squealing to get at the kill
sarahs eyes shine with excitement and she moves even closer whispering into the tape recorder
brooding behavior in evidence at the kill site pups are ushered forward and adults help them eat pulling flesh away from the carcass and a telephone rings
sarah stops in mid sentence unsure if she heard what she thought she heard
it rings again the unmistakable chirping of a cellular phone
sarah and makena both move at once pawing at a backpack
sarah contd a frantic whisper i thought you turned it off
two hyenas look inquisitively in the direction of the phone
sarah comes up with it and jabs at a button in irritation
sarah contd yes
someone speaks on the other end
sarah rolls her eyes
sarah contd ian
this better be important
sarah doesnt say anything for a long moment just listens as the voice on the other end talks
sarah contd when
ian malcolms leg badly scarred is bared and draped over the end of a bench
two sandbags are fastened to his ankle and malcolm is lifting them painfully rehabbing his injury while talking on a satellite phone
we leave in twenty four hours
five member team
behind them the sparks of a acetylene torch fly as workmen make modifications on several vehicles including a dark green mercedes benz aav all activity vehicle
the hood of the aav is up and the v engine has been pulled out a new smaller engine is lowered in its place
to one side are two long trailers connected by an accordion like passageway like on a subway car allowing one to be towed behind the other
eddie carrs handling all our equipment and hell be there to maintain it
hes designing special field trailers now top of the line mobile research units
eddie carr fortyish is barking out orders to the workmen
no no look at the plans henry you cant place that strut laterally it has to be crosswise look at the from the ceiling a large metal age crashes down
landing next to them on the floor with a deafening clang
they leap back and look up
a workman waves from a scaffolding
specs say it cant deform at psi we had to test it eddie bends down to inspect the cage which is rectangular constructed of inch thick titanium alloy bars
malcolm hangs up the phone and walks up joining him
minimal is too much
it has to be light it has to be strong light and strong light and strong sure why not its only impossible
god save me from academics
you are an academic
now i actually make things
i dont just talk
you think im all talk eddie
doesnt look at him it doesnt matter what i think
is there anything weve forgotten
anything at all
behind them someone clears their throat
eddie and malcolm turn around
kelly malcolm an african american girl around twelve years old stands in the doorway to the garage a duffel bag slung over one shoulder
she looks at malcolm and breaks into a wide grin
what are you doing here
she drops the bag on the floor and wraps her arms around him in a warm embrace
he responds stiffly
im all yours
you didnt forget did you
she pulls back and looks at him
kelly contd did you
kelly is slumped in a chair in eddies office next to the construction floor
outside the glass windows work on the vehicles continues unabated
malcolm hangs up the phone
okay karen is expecting you in half an hour
you only have to stay with her one night shell put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there
i dont even know this woman
well i do and shes fantastic
shell take you to the museum maybe to a movie if you play your cards right
youre going to have a fantastic time
stop saying fantastic
where are you going
i cant tell you
but ill be back within a week
my vacation is over in a week
ill make it up to you this summer
im your daughter all the time you know
not just when its convenient
your mother tell you to say that
i have thoughts of my own once in a while
from the construction floor eddie calls out
malcolm looks at her trying to make peace
is that kid still bothering you
you know at the bus stop
with the hair
that was about a year ago
well is he
richard talked to his parents
ian come here a minute
to malcolm i could come with you
out of the question
youd miss the gymnastics trials
youve been training for that for a year
i dont care about the trials i want to be with you
i could be your research assistant like i was in austin
this is nothing like austin
forget about it
you like to have kids you just dont want to be with them do you
he looks at her hurt
eddie calls out a third time impatient now
grateful for the escape malcolm gets up and heads for the door
he pauses guiltily
im not like you wan me to be
ive what i can be
while malcolm and eddie argue over something in the background kelly circles around the trailers and looks up at the windows
theyre all made of tempered glass fine wire mesh inside it
she looks around to see if anybodys watching
theyre not so she quickly slips inside the front trailer
inside the trailer is a miracle of planning and design
its divided into sections for different laboratory functions
the main area is a biological lab with specimen trays dissecting pans and microscopes that connect to video monitors
next to it theres an extensive computer section a bank of processors and a communications section
all the lab equipment is miniaturized and built into small tables that slides into the walls
everything is bolted down
she notices a large map on the wall
off the coat of costa rica there is an area that has been circled in heavy black ink
kelly puts a finger on the map crossing westward through the pacific ocean
thegre are dozen s of islands out here but in the highlighted region there is a semi circle of five
underneath the whole island chain there is a bold legend
the five deaths it says
slowly an ocean barge starts to chug its way across the face of the map leaving a wake that rolls the printed letters of those three ominous words
the map dissolves slowly away as the barge spalasehs through five foot ocean swells in the open sea
the barge is crammed with equipment the aav trailers a jeep and the members of malcolms team
malcolm stands in the bow riding the choppy seas
next to him dr
juttson fortyish holds onto the railing seasick
he shouts over the drone of the boats engines
as the waves pound the boat couldnt we just airlift into the island
harding insisted we go by sea
helicopters are too disruptive
these arent piles of bones youll be studying this time dr
juttson they live they breathe and they react
juttson looks at him skeptically and throws up
nick van owen a good looking american in his late twenties is sitting amid a pile of video cameras and other photographic equipment playing with a game bow
sarah harding dressed in field gear sits down next to him
so whats your story nick
i was a cameraman for nightline for six years been freelance since
do a lot of work for greenpeace
that must be interesting
what drew you there
bout eighty percent female in greenpeace
very noble of you
of the noisy game boy you dont think youre bringing that thing onto the island do you
nick grins and shuts it off
hey i wouldnt want to spook the woolly mammoths
you think this is all a joke
how am i supposed to keep a straight face when gestures to the black clad malcolm johnny cash here tells me im going to skull island
not amused ians a very good friend of mine
he doesnt need a friend he needs a shrink
i believe in him
but her face says even she has her doubts
come on theres only one reason any of us are here
his check cleared
she looks at him
drop the cynical pose
you cant pull it off while playing donkey kong
the boats captain a costa rican points ahead and shouts to them
there it is
they all turn and look out over the bow
up ahead shear reddish gray cliffs of volcanic rock rise dramatically out of the fog heavy ocean
captain contd isla sorna
the boat roars ahead plowing into a heavy wreath of fog
the mist swirls and encircles it
a narrow inlet cuts through the steep cliffs leading to the island interior
the barge bursts through the fog at the mouth of the fiord and heads deeper into the island
lush green plants drip everywhere in this verdant lagoon
sulfurous yellow steam issues from the ground bleaching the nearby foliage white
in the distance one can hear the cries of jungle birds
the boat is now beached and the crew flips the tarps off the aav the jeep and the trailers
the trucks back down a narrow ramp and onto the soft clay shore at the edge of the lagoon
there is a large three toad animal imprint in the clay at the waters edge and the aav backs right over it swapping its track for the animals
malcolm is at the edge of the water with the captain
be back in three days but keep the satellite phone on and your radio tuned to the frequency i specified in case we need you sooner
ive lived around here all my life these islands are completely in the distance they hear the faint strange roar of a very large animal
the captain looks at malcolm eyes wide
captain contd safe
the jeep tows the double trailer to the edge of a grassy plain just beyond the lagoon overlooking the interior of the island
the noon sun is high overhead below the valley shimmers in midday heat
eddie connects a flexible cable to the jeeps power winch and flicks it on
the cable turns slowly in the sunlight
moving along the length of it we see the cable leads to a pile of aluminum some kind of strut assembly painted a camouflage color
as the winch pulls the cable tight the jumble of thin struts begins to move slowly rising into the air
the emerging structure climbs spidery struts unfolding fifteen feet into the air
the light house at the top the cage that was tested back at eddies workshop is now just beneath the lowest branches of the nearby trees which almost conceal it
nick lights a cigarette and carelessly tosses the match on the ground
i know you all have probably concluded that im out of my mind
is it our imagination or did the trees behind malcolm just sway slightly
malcolm contd thats all right for now
but just humor me and be careful
no its not our imagination there they go again
whole trees shivering and swaying from left to right and back again
malcolm contd even if you think im harmless and deluded i promise now the trees creaks and groan as they sway
everyone has seen it and now malcolm turns around too
malcolm contd this place is for real
its quiet inside the trailers that serve as their command post living quarters
the books are lined up neatly on the shelves
the computers sit booted up and awaiting data input
all the way in the back past the spare tires and life preservers and canned food and bottled water up in one storage bin all the way on top theres
a rustling sound
a plastic student id card pops out in the cracks under the bins door
a photograph in the lower right hand corner of the card is visible its kelly malcolms twelve year old daughter
the card wriggles against the lock and with a soft click the door pops open
kelly herself tumbles out wrapped in several blankets and carrying a mason jar half full of a yellowish liquid
we can guess
she leaps to her feet blinks the light out of her eyes and bolts to the back of the trailer as fast as she possibly can
she races through a narrow door and slams it shut
a sign on the door says restroom
inside a sigh of relief is heard
along a stream bed the jungle trees still shiver
nick loads a three quarter inch tape into his heavy video camera and chews anxiously on a piece of gum
sarah and dr
juttson are beside him as the group nervously follows the groaning forest trees to their right
at the rear eddie and malcolm walk side by side
eddie is carrying a heavy silver rifle an aluminum canister hanging beneath the barrel
he shows it to malcolm his voice low and urgent
lindstradt air rifle
fires a subsonic fluger impact delivery dart
he cracks open the cartridge bank revealing a row of plastic containers filled with straw colored liquid
each is tipped with a three inch needle and carries a bright yellow warning tag extreme danger
eddie contd i loaded the enhanced venom of conus purpurascens the south sea cone shell
most powerful neurotoxin in the world
acts within a two thousandth of a second
faster than the nerve conduction velocity
the animals down before it feels the prick of the dart
from their right the shaking trees seen closer now
by walking down the stream bed the humans are tracking right along with the animals as they move in the foliage
to eddie is there an antidote
like if you shoot yourself in the foot
youd be dead before you realized youd accidentally pulled the trigger
ahead of them thick foliage blocks the path of the dried up stream bed to the height of about fifteen feet
but around them the crashing sounds get louder and closer the swaying trees shiver right beside them
eddie raises the rifle in defense as the trees right at the edge of the stream bed sway and part
above the foliage they see the sudden movement of a row of stegosaur fins
the spade shaped fins run along a ridge down the middle of the animals back about three feet tall each
the group freezes amazed and as the stegosaur continues on they get a good look at it through a break in the foliage
its a large dinosaur with a small head a thick neck and a huge lumbering body
a double row of plates runs along the crest of its back and it has a dragging trail with long spikes in it
the gum drops out of nicks mouth flops onto his shirt and sticks there
oh my god
a second stegosaur a baby about a quarter the size of the first animal breaks through the foliage following the adult
while the group is reaching to that the earth vibrates and a third stego by far the biggest of the three walks out of the foliage right behind them crossing
within ten feet
apparently unconcerned about these little creatures in their environment the stegos continue on across the stream bed
sarah raises a still camera and shoots pictures
her shutter is muted so that a muffled click is all thats audible
juttson raises a pocket recorder to his lips and whispers into it breathlessly
stegosaurus family stegosauridae infraorder stegosauria suborder thyreophora
length adult male estimate twenty five to thirty feet
his breathy words turn into almost helpless laughter of all things as he cant contain his astonishment
eddie covers his mouth trying to keep him quiet
to juttsn that was a pair bond
a family group even long after that infant was nestbound
i want to see the nesting ground
nick turns to malcolm eyes like saucers and makes a futile wordless boy was i wrong on this one gesture
malcolm smiles leans over and taps softly on nicks video camera
nick raises it to his shoulder and flicks it on as the group continues on into the bush after the animals
the baby wanders away from the group and ambles over near where sarah crouches in the bushes
sarah raises her camera again and silently snaps a picture
she whispers to juttson who is beside her
lone nest not colonial
i dont see an egg clutch
she gestures and juttson peers through a pair of field glasses
whispering back the empty shells are crushed and trampled
the young stay in the birth environment thats conclusive
not without a shot of the nest
she sees an opportunity
as the baby heads back to its parents sarah scoots right along with it moving behind it using its body as a shield to block her from the view of
the other two
nick and eddies faces whiten in alarm
nick reaches out to stop her but he barely gets hold of the sole of her boot before she pulls away from him and duckwalks out into the clearing
sarah slinks along behind the baby stego as it walks back toward the nest chewing the branches it carries in its south
she raises up sightly squeezing off pictures of the herd ever better as she gets closer
the others can only watch her aghast
sarah keeps moving closer
the baby passes a small grouping of rocks and sarah ducks behind them
shes now in a perfect position to photograph the nest and she squeezes off picture after picture from this ideal vantage point
she shoots the last picture on the roll and the cameras autowinder whirs to life
sarah looks down in horror as the cameras motor whines loudly in her hands
th noise startles the animals
the male turns toward her the plates on its back bristling
sarah gets to her feet and starts to move away slowly
the male turns away from her and swings its tail spikes extended
it whizzes through the air right at her but sarah leaps back at the last second and the tails spikes thud into the dirt where she was
sarah crunches to the ground and the three stegosaurs dart away disappearing into the bush moving surprisingly quickly for animals their size
the others run to sarah help her to her feet and pull her back against a massive tree trunk
but the tree trunk lifts right up off the ground
its no tree its a dinosaurs leg a massive one six feet across god knows how many feet high
the group gasps and looks up as a makenchiasaurus an enormous saurupod over a hundred feet from nose to tail lumbers away from them
the group stares in wonder as the mamenchiasaur stops and honks furtively its long neck stretched out above them
now a second mamenchiasaur neck cranes out of the surrounding forest trees and wraps around the first
the first mamenchiasaur thunders around in a semi circle getting into position behind the second
nick swings his video camera straight up and the group suddenly finds itself in the middle of a mamenchiasaur mating
the mighty tails swing and snap around them as the two animals come together and trees start snapping and falling crashing to the jungle floor
the group panics and bolts for cover toward the only place where the trees are not falling which is directly underneath the animals
amid honks and bleats the swinging tails continue to deforest the jungle around them
the noise and chaos is deafening drowning out the laughter and screams of the fascinated and terrified group
there is a momentary lull and the group dashes out from underneath the animals disappearing into the thick forest
the group collapses to the ground breathless chests heaving with wild frightened laughter
sarah goes to malcolm and throws her arms around him exhilarated
ian youre not insane
im so glad
out of breath dr
malcolm the world owes you an apology
suddenly the gathereres are taking their expedition a lot more seriously
they march quickly back to base camp their energy and excitement palpable
nick strikes a match and raises it to a cigarette with a shaking hand but sarah leans in and blows it out
no more smoking
we leave no scent of any kind
no hair tonics no cologne seal all our food in plastic bags
we will observe and document but we will not interact
thats a scientific impossibility you know
heisenberg uncertainty principle
whatever you study you also change
nick ejects the used videotape from his camera and pulls out a sharpie to label it
what should i call this
eddie next to him laughs
still to malcolm and lets forget about the high hide
we cant do this kind of work up in a tower we need to be out in the field as close to the animals as possible
im not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group but theres never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did
why wouldnt they
look at hyenas jackals nearly all species of predator birds that doesnt say a thing about t rex they could have been rogues
robert burke certainly thinks they were
weve got to see one to find out
is there any no way
oh my god
way we could safely oh no
he takes off running as fast as he can down the trail toward base camp
they look ahead in the direction nick is running
a plume of black smoke is rising up over the trees
nick bursts out of the trees and races toward the thick plume of smoke
in the middle of the base camp someone has neatly built a campfire surrounded by stones
flames burn in the middle
nick races over to it and stomps it out as the others emerge from the trees behind him
nick grabs a jug of water but sarah steps in
water mixes the smoke billow use dirt
they start to kick and rake dirt onto the fire with their hands and feet
eddie and dr
juttson jump in and help out
who the hell started a campfire
it was just to make lunch
malcolm turns toward the source of the voice
kelly stands in the doorway of the trailer sheepish
kelly contd i wanted it ready when you got back
the whole group stares stunned none more so than malcolm himself
later and base camp is a blur of activity
sarah juttson nick and eddie are hard at work burying the remains of the fire sealing their food in plastic bags loading camera equipment packing up specimen containers and other
information gathering equipment
malcolm meanwhile is lecturing kelly
you know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation but you didnt bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in
you dont have the faintest idea whats going on on this island
loading a backpack what do you want to do ian lock her up for curiosity
where do you think she gets it
to nick do you have chromium tapes
the others fog in high humidity i know
waving a tape highest lead density on the market
to malcolm weve got a lot of heavy marching ahead of us
im not carrying anybody
i can keep up
youre going home
im sending a radio call for the boats
well all go down to the lagoon and wait for them
lighten up ian you sound like a high school vice principal
im her father
nick leans over and whispers to eddie gesturing to malcolm and kelly
do you see any family resemblance here
you cant stay kelly thats it
its too dangerous
if its so dangerous whyd you bring any of us
youre wrong dad
i do know whats going on on this island
how could you possibly
because you said so
maybe nobody else believed you but i always did
he looks at her touched
nick mutters to eddie again
the kid scores with cheap sentiment
ian if we recall the boat now weve made two invasive landings in one day
thatll have to go in any paper i write and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated
you know the academic world as well as i do once they smell blood in the water youre dead
our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic
that means if we bend a blade of grass we bend it right back the way it a low sound has been rising while she speaks and now it comes
booming over the jungle around them a thunderous racket that shakes the very ground beneath them
suddenly three c military cargo planes thunder overhead and roar toward the island interior flying very low
the planes are enormous fat assed creatures their rear cargo doors hanging open
the members of the gatherer expedition hit the dirt and peer over a ledge watching as the airplanes bank and circle over a specific spot
eddie raises a pair of field glasses
huge metal equipment containers are shoved out the back of the cargo bays
they snap off trees like matchsticks crush flat anything foolish enough to exist where they want to land
now men pour out the rear of the planes their low altitude parachutes billowing open behind them
nick looks at sarah
you were saying something about antiseptic
metal container doors clang to the ground jeep engines roar to life in a cloud of thick black diesel smoke blue laser barriers sizzle and burn through foliage as this
group of hunters establishes a perimeter around their new camp
peter ludlow dressed in brand new banana republic safari wear steps into the center of the camp and surveys the surroundings
he turns to dr
robert burke a ragged pony tailed man in wire rimmed glasses
welcome to your dream come true dr
burke has a detailed set of satellite recon photographs that he spreads out on the hood of a jeep
i believe the large herbivores forage in open plains like bison which would explain the great variety of heat dots were reading in the flatlands around this waterhole
then thats where were going
burke flips open a manifest that he will carry with him at all times
inside there are dozens of sketches of various kinds underneath
as each vehicle roars out of the equipment container burke slips a waterproof eight by ten card with an icon of the various dinosaurs on the island into a slot
in the dashboard
calling them off hadrosaurus
as the procession goes on ludlow turns to dieter stark the man we saw welding earlier
this is as good a place as any for base camp
first priority is the laser barriers i want them all up and running in thirty minutes
half an hour understand
dieter nods and turns to some of the hunters who number about twenty in all that are working nearby
but someone steps in front of dieter cutting him off
its roland tembo the hunter from the bar in mombassa
cancel that dieter
roland points to a stream running nearby
carnivores hunt near stream beds
do you want to set up base camp or an all you can eat people bar
thinks you heard his dieter
find a new spot
and remember were after herbivores only no unnecessary risks
dieter sighs and goes to work
roland puts an arm around ludlow and pulls him aside
peter if you want me to run your little camping trip there are two conditions
first im in charge and when im not around dieter is
your job is to sign the checks tell us were doing a good job and open your case of scotch when we have a good day
second condition my fee
you can keep it
all i want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs
why and how are my business
if you dont like either of those conditions youre on your own
go ahead and set up your camp right here or in a swamp or in the middle of a rex nest for all i care
but ive been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas
what else can he say
the jungle foliage shivers quakes and finally falls as the hunters convoy roars into the hart of the jungle
dieter stark stands in the front of the lead vehicle the speedbird waving the convoy forward his driver carter at the wheel beside him
ludlow is in the back seat of the speedbird next to dr
roland and ajay his tracker are in the second jeep
they look up as the brakelights on the speedbird flash and the car stops forcing the rest of the convoy to halt as well
in the front the speedbird flashes its lights at something in front of it
dieter climbs out plainly irritated
he walks around the front of the car and sees four pachycephalosaurs eating grass in the middle of the jungle trail
theyre about five feet tall thick heavy set animals whose distinctive feature is an enormous skull casing a tall impressive crown that rises on the tops of their heads
dieter doesnt seem impressed
he looks back at ludlow who look at dr
burke stands up in his seat a look of wonder on his face
no herbivore late cretaceous
very unusual plant eater see that distinctive domed skull
thats nine inches of solid bone
just get them out of the way dieter
the pachys look up at him sluggishly still eating like cows chewing their cuds
as unimpressive with him as he is with them they go back to their grass
dieter contd oh for gods he slings his rifle off his shoulder and aims it at the closest animal
behind him roland has climbed out of the second jeep
this is a round up not a war
use your powers of persuasion
dieter gestures to the speedbird to pull ahead which it does slowly toward the animals
the pachys look up alert but do not move
dieter walks toward them
come on come on dont have all day
going on to no one in particular see the pachys neck attaches at the bottom of its skull instead of the back of its head as with reptiles
the speedbird draws closer
the first pachy stares at it intently
the lead vehicle gets closer closer and bangs into the pachy knocking it back a few feet out of the way
burke contd so when it lowers its head its neck lines up directly with its backbone ajay is staring at something on the ground at his feet
he takes a few steps further into the foliage then turns back toward roland
the pachys turn and hop away
dieter turns and heads back to the speedbird
as he reaches for the door a voice calls look out
from behind him
dieter spins around just in time to see the first pachy in full charge
it slams headfirst into the speedbird smashing the headlights and denting the grill
concluding his lecture which is perfect for absorbing impact
dieter turns and runs around to the front of the car
the pachy has backed up for another run and is now charging right dieter retreats quickly and rips open the passenger door to protect himself
the pachy clobbers the door sending dieter flying against the car knocking the wind out of him
in the other jeeps the rest of the hunters stand up or lean out the window for a better look laughing
the pachy head butts the tire next to dieter
it bounces off tumbles to the ground and rolls to its feet as dieter gets to his knees and crawls toward the back of the speedbird
but the pachy is quicker and lunges at dieter again
hes forced to hit the dirt and crawls quickly underneath the speedbird just as the animal slams into the rear of the vehicle
now the other three animals join the jun
ludlow and the driver have to cover their heads as the animals lunge at the car again and again smashing the steel meshed windows and mangling the quarter panels
the rest of the group watches vastly amused
ajay and roland are staring at something on the ground an animal footprint three toed enormous
it matches the pictures
it certainly does
roland gets up and goes back to his vehicle ignoring the pachy demolition derby that continues up at the speedbird
roland opens a case in the back of the jeep revealing his gun
its an antique elephant gun a double barreled nitro express
nearly a hundred years old its still in immaculate condition its rosewood stock buttery smooth bisons delicately engraved along its silver breach
the barrels are twenty four inches long topped with an ivory bead foresight at the business end
roland scoops up the gun breaks the breach and pulls two rounds of ammunition from his shirt pocket
four inches long and three quarters of an inch in diameter these are the largest full metal jacket cartridges ever made
he slips one into each barrel and heads back into the bush
roland pauses before he goes as if noticing the animals trashing the speedbird for the first time
the pachys all freeze staring at him
roland waves one hand hisses sharply between his teeth and the pachys scatter back into the jungle
takes care of that problem
roland turns and heads back into the jungle calling out over his shoulder to ludlow
roland contd dont worry about us
well catch up
where do you think youre going
to collect my fee
and with that he disappears into the foliage
the driver of the speedbird drops it into gear and the battered car groans forward
as it moves ahead it reveals dieter lying underneath it ego bruised worse than body
ajay takes a step into the bush but at a ninety degree angle away from the direction in which the animals tracks lead
roland points in the direction in which the footprints lead
roland contd im no tracker but even i can read this spoor
do you wish to go where the animal has been or where the animal is
ajay sets off in his direction and roland follows
seen from a ridge above them the hunters convoy continues to plow through the jungle
but how the hunters themselves are being tracked followed by the gatherers
they scurry along as fast as they can trying to keep pace with the moving vehicle below
why didnt you tell us about these guys ian
because i didnt know
i dont have the faintest idea what theyre doing here
angry ruining everything thats what theyre doing
you could choke on the diesel smoke already
ian nothing we observe will be valid if were trailing along in the wake of an army
kelly has a pair of binoculars and is studying the vehicles as they move below
where does it say that
on the side of that one truck
malcolm takes the binoculars and stares down there himself
ingen is a genetics corporation isnt it
to malcolm is that who were really working for
were an independently funded expedition
funded by whom
but hes the head of ingen
you gotta be kidding
to malcolm you dragged me out of greenpeace to be a corporate stooge
you couldnt get anybody else
yeah what have you done dad
wed better keep moving or well lose them
the group moves on ahead but malcolm lingers angry staring through the binoculars
what are you doing to me john
ajay and roland make their way through the foliage and come into a small clearing where a cluster of caves is carved into the rock
ajay freezes gesturing ahead to the cave on the far left
roland pulls up a handful of grass and releases it on the breeze
it floats back between his legs
he proceeds toward the cave carefully ajay behind him
they can see nothing beyond the yawning mouth of the cave only a black interior
roland pauses looking down
on the ground to his right he sees the partially eastern leg of a creature
its old crawling with white maggots and flies
roland continues on
closer to the cave he now passes the skull of a large animal some of the flesh and green skin still adhering to the bone
it too is covered with flies
still he continues on
a short rise leads into the cave and they edge up it
from inside the cave they can hear an odd squeaking sound very high pitched
crawling now roland and ajay scale a four foot circular rampart of dried mud and peer into the tyrannosaur nest
its flattered inside about ten feet in diameter completely encircled by earthen walls
a baby tyrannosaur about four and a half feet long is in the center of the nest
it has a large head very large eyes and its body is covered with a fluffy red down which gives it a scraggly appearance
it squeaks repeatedly tearing awkwardly at the remains of a chunk of animal flesh biting decisively with tiny sharp teeth
the cave itself is a foul boneyard
animal carcasses litter the edges flies buzz in the captive air
roland raises a bandana to his nose to cover the stench
he turns to ajay and its the rex nest
the baby tyrannosaur hears the whisper and looks up cocking its head in curiosity
make a blind here
wait for the buck to return
shakes his head no if the nest is upwind so are we
when he comes back hell know were here before we have a chance
the truck in the nest below the baby squeaks angrily at the intruders
roland contd is to get him to come where we want him
the baby squeaks again indignant
roland turns and looks down at it
as the sun glows bright orange on the horizon nick raises a pair of binoculars to his eyes and peers down at the vista below the ridge
in the lenses of the binoculars we can clearly see a mixed herd of midsized herbivores hardosaurs pachycephalosaurs and callimimuses racing across the plain below
malcolm also staring through binoculars lies on the ridge beside him
sarah is several feet behind them her back pressed against a tree unwilling to go to the lip of the ridge
we see a shaky point of view of the herd running
the binoculars whip to the right revealing a jeep chasing the herd not just one jeep in fact but a whole fleet of hunter pursuit vehicles
there are two herding jeeps one motorcycle as speedier mini jeep and further behind a container truck and a wranglers pickup truck
although theres a great deal of commotion below up here its almost eerily silent
nick lowers the binoculars angry
when he raises them again the sun flares off the lens and when the brilliant flare clears were right down in the middle of the roundup
engines roar wheels spin and dig in the dirt men shout and radios squawk as the hunter vehicles pursue the fleeting herd theyre flushed
the hunter shout and shriek with glee incredulous and thrilled by the spectacular animals theyre pursuing
one of the pursuit vehicles a snagger pulls ahead of the others
dieter stark stands in the passenger seat holding a long pole with a noose dangling from the end of it
he swings the pole out over the side of the jeep and shouts to the driver
the driver hits the gas and the snagger leaps forward gaining on the herd
aware of the danger behind them the herd veers to the right toward the cover of thick jungle but the motorcycle roars in from the right side cutting them off
herding them back out into the open
peter ludlow stands in a conning tower a command post in the heaviest pursuit vehicle
he barks into a walkie talkie
alive dieter and uninjured
the driver can barely keep up with the twists and feints thrown by the herd ahead of him
dieter curses and throws the lasso pole into the back of the jeep
ludlows voice continues over the radio in dieters jeep
those are very expensive animals
can you hear me
to the driver turn that off
the driver snaps off the radio as dieter grabs a long barreled rifle from the back of the vehicle
guns it again forcing the herd back into the middle of the plain
from the trees to the left two heads on enormous necks rise up in alarm
two apatosaurs are startled from the bush and lumber out across the middle of the plain
the herd doesnt even break stride but keeps running scampering after the giants and stampeding right between their massive legs
one smaller pachycephalosaur bolts loose but the motorcycle cuts it off and herds it back into the middle which now takes the motorcycle right through the rising and falling legs
of the apotosaurs
the bike chases the pachy out the other side and as the apatosaurs disappear into the distance the cycle isolates the juvenile
another truck a scissor rig spots the isolated animal
high in the back of the truck a hunter mans a tranquilizer cannon drawing a bead on the pachy as the cycle runs it down
he fires and the tranquilizer dart hits the animal in the neck
its pace slows and another hunter from the truck tosses a lasso around its neck
they crank a winch reeling in the animal
as the truck gain on it two six foot padded arms with what look like heavy airbags on the insides open up on the front of the truck
as the animal is pulled in the scissors close with a hydraulic whir trapping the animal between its airbags
now a pick up rig roars up and drops its back gate
the scissor rig rolls forward depositing the squirming pachy in this dino contaiment vehicle
two hunters throw levers on the side of the scissor bars and the scissor rig backs away leaving the animal still pinched between the bars imprisoned in the back of
the pick up rig
the hunters quickly fit new scissor bars onto the scissor rig and it takes off back into the hunt
dieter rifle in hand drops down into the passenger seat whips a harness over himself and clicks it into place
he jabs his thumb into a flashing red button in the dashboard
immediately a motor underneath the seat hums to life and the seat itself telescopes extending a good four feet out to dieter raises the gun picks a carinthosaur a red
crested herbivore from the rear of the fleeting herd and takes aim
the carinthosaur staggers as a tranquilizer dart sticks in its left hindquarter
there is utter quiet
nick and the others stare wordlessly at the spectacle below
the snagger shudders to a halt in the dirt kicking up a huge cloud of dust and dirt
the motorcycle spins to a stop beside it its driver pushing his mask up to reveal his sweat and dirt streaked face
the wrangler truck backs up and drops its rear door which clangs heavily to the ground
four wranglers carrying wire noose poles and chains race down the ramp and out of the truck
dieter jumps off the snagger
he puts down his tranquilizer gun picks up a long steel rod and walks forward slowly
ahead of him the carinthosaur is still on its feet
the sedated animal staggers fighting to retain its balance while it is surrounded by the wary wranglers
easy easy not too close
the wranglers adjust their poles extending them another three feet which allows them to stay further from the reeling ten foot tall animal
dieter contd now
almost as one the wranglers flip their noose over the stunned animals neck
it thrashes but the wranglers hold their poles tightly surrounding and immobilizing it
nick turns away
he cant watch
a bolero type device a rope with a round weight at either end whips around the carinthosaurs legs
the animal thuds to the dirt with a snort of a defeat
ludlow steps up next to dieter and both of them stare down at the helpless animal
ludlows breathing heavily eyes glowing
the animal is still thrashing pumping its legs crazily
dieter turns a knob on the side of the steel rod hes holding and thrusts it into the defenseless animals neck
a blue arc of electricity cracks and dances over the carinthosaurs body
the animal convulses in pain a horrible high pitched squealing rips the air
burke their paleontologist hurries forward with a syringe
he draws a certain amount of tranquilizer from a bottle and injects it into the animals thigh
carter dieters driver steps up with a can of spray paint and quickly tags the animal with an id number in day glo orange
dieter pulls the card with an icon of a carinthosaur from the dashboard of the jeep and marks a black x over the drawing of the animal
night has fallen over the island
the hunters have established base camp in an area they have trampled and cleared just below the ridge
blue laser fences encircle the perimeter
inside half a dozen tents are set up around a central campfire
the vehicles are all parked at one end away from the tents
at the other end there is a row of at least a dozen capture containers cages that hold the imprisoned dinosaurs they have already rounded up
sarah malcolm and nick stand at the edge of the ridge above looking down at the scene
sarah stands a bit further back from the others not wanting to get too close to the edge
voices waft up to them raucous laughing some even singing
juttson has a pair of night vision binoculars trained on the cages
carinthosaurus compsognathus triceratops pachycephalosaurus or small scavengers only
malcolm also with binoculars furrows his brow seeing something below
he sees peter ludlow standing in the middle of the camp pointing giving orders
malcolm drops the binoculars
thats why hammond was in such a hurry for me to get here
he knew they were coming
he gives the binoculars to sarah who moves forward gingerly
malcolm contd you okay
irritated heights i cant help it
put your arm here will you
she puts his arm around her waits to steady her while she is close to the cliff edge
what do they want
they want their money back
to ingen this island is nothing more than a bed investment
we should get back to base camp
eddies waiting for us
i cant believe peter ludlows running all this
check out the guy walking past the fire
she hands the binoculars to malcolm
malcolm sees roland whos walking with ajay weapons and equipment slung over their shoulders
ive seen him before
he and that guy with him were spearhunting jaguars
said it was immoral to go after them any other way
hes not just a hunter hes a philosopher
kind of guy who beats you up with your own argument
sarah contd hes the one in charge
well if thats true the man in charge just left camp
nick who has been quietly fuming next to them now steps forward
then this is our chance
our chance to do what
i dont know these guys but i know em
ive seen em on japanese whalers french barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the north atlantic
theyre all the same
they spray us with water cannon when we try to stop em sink our boats and then call us crazy
he rummages through his pack coming up with various tools
a hunting knife
a bolt cutter
nick contd nobody has to come with me
ive done this before
you are a tree hugger
he looks at her hurt
there no reason for name calling
juttson please take kelly back to camp right away
leave the other car for us and well meet you there in an hour or so
what are you guys gonna do
signs exactly what john hammond wanted us to do
in the hunters supply tent a case of twelve year old scotch sits open amid crate after crate of weapons and ammunition
peter ludlow reaches in and pulls a bottle out
in the jungle ludlow approaches a small clearing
roland is bent over a small stake in the ground chaining something to it
as ludlow approaches and walks around him he sees what protest
roland looks up
offering a little incentive
ludlow laughs and shakes his head
he takes a drink and offers roland one
ludlow notices rolands gun leaning against a tree
what kind of gun is that
karimojo bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant
foot pound striking force
how close do you have to be
i assume itll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down
why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill
roland just looks at him
or a laser beam from a satellite
ludlow leans down close to the baby rex and examines it while it thrashes on its chain
its mouth has been bound shut with a leather strap
you rally think thisll draw the parent
i once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep
all the jeep had done was startle the bulls calves
i saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles all the way back to its den just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill
rex wont be any different
youre kidding yourself
an adult t rex cares about one thing filling its own belly
it acts the way people wish they could thats why everyones fascinated by it
if people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only ninety nine percent would he stops an idea on his face
ludlow contd wait
i hadnt planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk but i only thought of adults it never occurred to me close to the animal you are a
billion dollar idea my little f crack
the tyrannosaur even with its jaws clamped shut lunges at ludlows face head butting him right across the bridge of the nose
ludlow staggers back waiting in pain clutching his bleeding face
ludlow like an enraged child snatches up rolands gun and brings the butt down viciously on the rexs leg
the bone breaks with a dry snap and the animal howls in pain
roland lunges and throws ludlow to the ground but the damage is done
what the hell you do that for
as his pain eases ludlow feels a bit foolish but he attempts to cover
to keep him still for the trip
youve broken its leg
weve got to transport it seven thousand miles
would you prefer it bit off the leg of a crew member
he gets up brushes himself off and heads back to the camp trying to salvage his dignity
roland watches him go
at the edge of the hunters camp nick sarah and malcolm scramble down a hillside and stop at the edge of the laser barriers
there are three beams each about two feet apart the tallest almost six feet off the ground
nick reaches the edge and crouches
sarah helped by malcolm steps up onto his back and jumps over the top landing with a crunch
nick is next given a boost by malcolm who is then left alone on the other side
he backs up a few steps jogs right at the lasers then springs off his good leg and does the fosburry flop right over the top
he lands with a thud to the silent admiration of the other two
the three of them creep along hiding behind a stack of fuel barrels
they lean around the edge for a look
theyre directly behind the row of vehicle
they move into the open covering the ground between them and the jeeps
reaching them nick hits the dirt and wriggles under the first one
malcolm and sarah stand lookout
nick pulls the bolt cutter from his back pocket
he squirms along until he finds the jeeps fuel line and he snips it
he ducks out of the way just as the stream of fuel begins to pour into the dirt
move slowly down the line standing watch as nick crawls out from under the first jeep and proceeds to the second
they hear another snip then keep moving to cover him as he moves to the third
from in the distance malcolm hears a sound a faint high pitched screeching
he turns and looks to that direction
its the baby t rex still screening
up in a nearby tree roland and ajay have spread some broken branches crosswise to form a high hide of their own about ten feet off the ground
roland raises his binoculars
the light of the camp spills all the way out here illuminating some of the jungle
he scans it searching for any sign of movement
back in the camp sarah malcolm and nick have finished with all of the vehicles except the badly battered one which is parked some distance away undergoing repairs
the motor pool area is now a soggy lake of spilled gasoline
the saboteurs walk casually across the camp unnoticed in the drunken revelry
they pass several tents the shadows of the partiers visible as they move inside
they continue across the camp and arrive at the other side to face the caged animals
the carinthosaur that was tranquilized earlier stands there dully eyes heavy and glassy still under the effects
they pass a stegosaur its row of fine bristling
and finally they reach the largest cage which houses a triceratops the size of a pickup truck nick pulls out his trusty bolt cutters
he looks at them a glint in his eye
we may encounter some turbulence
in one of the hunter tents peter ludlow leans over the satellite recon pictures of the island planning the next days assault with dieter and dr
burke their paleontologist
there are small wooden dinosaur models scattered around the photos indicating where certain species can be found
if youre really interested in infants well have better luck at the seaside because the sands offer a cushioning surface where the egg clutches can can he trails off
a low rumbling sound can be heard outside and the little wooden dinosaurs start shaking on the board
they look at each other
the rumbling gets louder
outside someone shouts on the board the little dinosaurs start hopping and bouncing from the vibrations the shouts outside turn to screams they turn and look at the back of
the tent and the triceratops bursts right through the canvas
hunters go flying as the tent covered triceratops its horns tearing through the canvas rumbles across the camp
men shout in alarm the triceratops bellows in anger and confusion chaos reigns
in the crush of people running every which way malcolm and sarah are swept off in one direction while nick is buffeted in another
they shout but cannot be heard over the frey
the triceratops blinded by the canvas shroud stomps right through the fire in the middle of the camp and the tent bursts now really upset the animal panics and lashes
out in all directions blasting through tents demolishing and or setting ablaze anything that gets in its way
its considerable hindquarters slam into a parked jeep sending it rolling across the camp
the jeep flattens the largest tent and slams down on its side
its broken gas line sprays gas over the ground the gas hits one of the dozens of small blazes the triceratops has left in its wake and the flame shoots
up the ribbon of gas
the jeep explodes
roland and ajay up in the tree leap to their feet as a fireball rises up from the camp in the distance
what in gods
the rest of the newly freed animals now storm through the camp
the blue laser barriers bounce crazily and go out as the sending units are trampled underfoot by the fleeing animals
nick takes advantage of the downed lasers to slip part the bordere of the camp and disappear into the jungle in one direction while malcolm and sarah vanish in the
the burning tent which was the equipment tent now detonates in a series of smaller explosions
dieter and several others are knocked to the ground by the series of concessive blasts
he drags himself up onto all fours charred and bruised
a burning tire rolls slowly past him spinning to a stop at rolands feet
dieter looks up at him
last time i leave you in charge
nick breaks out into the jungle clearing the same one where ajay and roland had their blind
he sees the baby tyrannosaur chained to the stake
he goes to the animal which now bleats in pain its broken leg hanging at an odd angle
with one strong tug nick pulls the stake out of the ground
roland surveys the destruction
the fire has spread and several tents are now tongues of flame flapping in the air the animals are gone or going and their personnel are scattered and terrified
peter ludlow breathless face smeared with dirt and smoke staggers up to roland
what in christs name is going on
isnt it obvious
he holds up the sniped padlock from one of the animal cages
nick contd were not alone on this island
malcolm and sarah race back up onto the ridge trail where the green aav is parked
nick bursts around from the other side of the car
nick thank god we didnt know if malcolm opens the rear door
wait dont with a piercing shriek the baby tyrannosaur now in the back of the aav flings itself at the open doorway jaws snapping just short of malcolms nose
he slams the door
roland hears the commotion up on the ridge and looks up
do we have anyone up there
malcolm is confronting nick
it has a broken leg
so do it a favor and put it out of its misery
get in the car before they hear us
he runs around and leaps in the drivers seat
sarah slips into the passenger seat quickly leaving malcolm no choice but the rear
the aav slaps through the jungle foliage
from inside the car we can hear the baby tyrannosaur screaming in anger
the baby writhes on the base seat next to malcolm who has flattened himself against the door as far away from the animal as possible
ian close the window its going to wake every predator in the jungle
malcolm leans over the enraged animal and cranks up its window
the tyrannosaur slashes with one of its powerful hind legs ripping the flesh of his forearm
he shouts in pain
outside the listening jungle whizzes by
up in the high hide eddie dr
juttson and kelly are standing watch scanning the jungle for any sign of their returning comrades
juttson yanks the night vision binoculars away from his face as he spots the aav pulling up to the base camp a couple hundred yards away
there they are
they all turn and look but eddie furrows his brow watching them pull the wounded animal from the back seat
what is that they have with them
sarah and nick carry the screeching baby tyrannosaur in their arms headed for the trailer
malcolm holding his bleeding arm isnt far behind
sarah and nick bring the screaming infant to the metal dining table and hold it down
malcolm is right behind them
this is exceedingly unwise
sarah turns away from a drawer of medical supplies holding a small syringe
her shirt is streaked with blood from the babys injured leg
too late to worry about that
hold him together nick
nick tightens his grip on the animal and sarah makes an injection into its thigh over its loudly voiced objections
just do whatever you have to do and get it out of here as quickly as possible
sarah picks up a small ultrasound transducer and runs it over the animals leg
a green and white skeletal image appears on a monitor next to the table
okay theres the metatarsals tibia fibula there it is
thats a fracture just above the epiphysis
they peer closely at the monitor
that little black line
that little black line means death for this infant
the fibula wont heal straight so the ankle joint cant pivot when he stands on his hind feet
the baby wont be able to run and probably cant even walk
itll be crippled and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old
can you set up
thinking it has to be temporary something thatll break apart and fall off as the animal grows
think fast sarah
the tyrannosaur still in pain shrieks again
through their binoculars the rest of the group watches the trailer carefully
even inside the animals screeches are clearly audible
kelly is getting scared
what are they doing
why dont they hurry
give me the radio
from the trailer the baby lets out a long plaintive one by one eddie kelly and juttson turn around and stare into the night jungle
nick holds the animal while sarah fits an aluminum foil cuff around its injured leg and paints it with a coating of resin
malcolm at the window stares out anxiously
the animal thrashes again
give it more morphine
well kill it with too much well put it into respiratory arrest
im almost done
damn it i need another adhesive something pliable i can her eyes fall on nick
she holds out her hand urgently
sarah contd spit
he spits his bubblegum into the palm of her hand
the baby rex cries out again
from the swaying jungle there is another answering roar
and this ones closer
in the high hide the rest of the group stares trembling
in the distance a flock of birds shrieks and takes flight as the tops of some trees move a whole section of forest suddenly coming alive as if brushed by
but its not the wind
they hear noises thuds in the jungle
and then another section of forest trembles
another flock of birds bursts out of the treetops and swarms past the high hide
what is it
juttson puts an arm around kelly instinctively pulling her closer to him
eddie whispers urgently into the walkie talkie
sarah come in
there is a radio box mounted on the far wall of the trailer
the speaker buzzes urgently with eddies voice
sarah malcolm can you hear me
on the table sarah is frantically molding nicks bubblegum into place on the makeshift splint
but the baby rex regaining its strength is thrashing again
hold it down nick
from the radio is anybody there
malcolm moves to answer the radio but sarah shouts to him
ian get the bottle of amoxicillin and fill a syringe
quick injection of antibiotics and i can get it out of here
forsaking the radio malcolm moves to the medicine drawer and comes up with what she wants
working fast he draws twenty ccs of the pink liquid
still from the radio now desperate they ignore him as sarah grabs the syringe and makes the injection
eddie has given up on whispering as he clutches the radio desperately
nick sarah and malcolm spin around at hearing that terrible piece of information
he bolts over to the wall speaker and hits the button
malcolm contd let me talk to kelly is she a deafening roar sound from just outside the trailer followed immediately by a crashing sound
they whirl and look to the window just in time to see the aav tumbling by rolling on its side
there is another roar and the baby on the table roars in response
outside the window the head of a full grown tyrannosaurus rex lowers and peers inside
malcolm sarah and nick all freeze in absolute terror
the rex outside gurgles making material cooing noises
the baby rex calm for the first time gurgles back
but across the trailer in the opposite window another t rex this one roars deeply a roar so low and loud it rattles anything in the trailer that isnt tied
what do they want
what do you think they want
thats impossible they cant have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here
current evidence seems to be to the contrary wouldnt you say
give it nick hands shaking grabs the shoulder video camera he used earlier
he whips out the cassette thats in there hurls it into an open duffel bag with half a dozen others slams a fresh cassette in and flicks the on switch
sarah and malcolm meanwhile hurry to the other end of the trailer carrying the baby rex
outside the two adult rexes stay with them walking in the same direction watching them through the window
seen from outside the light inside the trailers clearly illuminates sarah and malcolm as they carry the bay rex
the adult rexes tower over the trailer twice as tall and nearly as long
they walk slowly alongside it hunched over watching their infant
at the door to the trailer sarah un muzzles the frantic baby
malcolm reaches for the door handle
he dives down on the floor under them pointing the video camera up at the door getting the best shot
malcolm takes a breath turns the knob and throws open the door
outside the enormous rex heads pause for a moment staring surprised
although terrified sarah actually starts to sing
softly born free as free as the wind blows
as free as the grass grows are you insane
i swear to god it works with lions sometimes
there we are your baby is free the baby excited wriggles free of them and lands on the ground outside
not wasting a second malcolm slams the door shut
the three of them freeze not daring to breath
outside they can hear the snuffling and cooing of the animals as they inspect their young and then the soft thud of their footsteps growing fainter as they move away
from the wall eddies voice comes over the radio relieved
theyre going back into the jungle
eddie juttson and kelly sag back against the railings of the high hide
malcolms voice comes over the radio
are you all right
she takes the radio her voice shaky
malcolm is at the radio
ill come up in a minute
dont move understand
malcolm slump against the wall of the trailer
sarah and nick sit on the floor leaning against the opposite wall completely drained
sarah pulls out her pocket recorder and speaks shakily into it
note to dr
juttson tyrannosaurus rex does nurture its young
they laugh weakly
theres uh theres an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone
you stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on
whether or not you feel lucky
one no from anybody in the group and you turn around right there no question asked nobody embarrassed
do we go on
they all laugh
im satisfied with the evidence we have right now
i feel vindicated
john hammond will too
to sarah do you have enough to publish
they will come after me
but i can collect some stool samples for dna with that nicks tapes and the rest of you to back me up it should stand when we get back
getting up then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back
ill call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now
this expedition is over
he goes to the desk and picks up the heavy gray satellite phone thats resting in a battery pack
the front panel lights up a brilliant green
but from the wall speaker the radio crackles and eddies voice breaks through soft and empty
i am so sorry
malcolm and sarah look at the speaker box
what the hell is he sorry f a low rattle sneaks into the trailer
malcolm sarah and nick takes a step forward from the walls looking around
the rattle gets louder the trailer shakes and vibrates everything in it starts to bang against the walls and something huge smashes into the side of the trailer
theyre all thrown against the far wall there is an earsplitting crack of electricity the entire trailer rocks and sparks a brilliant blue and then everything goes black
the satellite phone flies out of malcolms hands and smacks against the wall
it lands on the floor its number pad still glowing green
nick crawls over and looks out one of the windows
outside the flank of one of the tyrannosaurs wipes past the window revealing the second tyrannosaur charging straight at the trailer
they hurl themselves at the nearest solid object and hang on for dear life
the charging rex slam into the side of the trailer which rocks up on one side bangs back down and is quickly rammed again by the furious animal
this time the entire trailer rolls over completely upside down
sarah nick and malcolm let go of their precarious handholds and drop onto the ceiling
the tables chairs lab equipment everything thats bolted down clings to the floor above them everything that isnt rains down on them
but the rexes arent done
the trailer jolts into motion sliding forwards
the upside down trailer which is the rear of the two trailers slides along the muddy ground pushing up earth in front of it
theyre pushing us
malcolm frantic crawls up to a window to get a look outside
he looks down and sees a t rex footprint in the earth outside as they move past it
he cranks his head to get a look at the direction in which they are being pushed
his eyes widen at something he sees outside the window
theyre pushing us over the cliff
sure enough out the back window we see a few more feet of muddy earth and then nothing but inky black
the three of them look at each other for a moment and then crawl like hell toward the other end of the trailer
the opposite end reaches the edge of the cliff and starts up to tip ever so slightly downward
they reach the accordion like connector and malcolm crawls into it
which is right side up malcolm can see the two rexes hard at it pushing the front end of the trailer
nick has a pretty good grip at the top of the trailer but sarah can only cling to an air vent in the ceiling as stuff starts to roll and
tumble past her headed downhill
the angle increases the trailer dips and now stuff starts to freefall right past her some smashing her in the head
malcolm still in the connecting tube grabs hold
sarah starting to be pulled downward paws at the refrigerator getting a g rip on the handle
the door held by a safety latch doesnt open
below sarah debris falls to the rear window of the trailer
through the cracking glass we can see the surf crashing five hundred feet below
the refrigerator bolts suddenly crunch free of the wall
the box strains on its power cord
still clinging to the handle sarah swings wildly as it starts to come loose swaying above her
the safety latch on the door gives it swings open and a shower of food bangs off of her as gravity empties the contents
sarah loses her grip and plummets through the now vertical trailer
she screams covers her head and smashes into the rear window
the glass spiderwebs but does not break
an enormous wave pounds the rocky shore
above sarah is a tiny figure sprawled out on the glass held invisibly by the breaking window
nick shouts to her
sarah stunned by the fall blinks a few times regaining her senses
she looks down at the crashing surf so far below
for a person with a fear of heights this is a real drag
as she stares the rocks seem to move even farther away from her
she blanches the world spins around her
her breath fogs the cracked glass
slowly she tries to get up caaaaaarefully pulling herself up to her hands and knees
but as she puts pressures on her hands the glass cracks even more tiny spiderwebs shooting out around her fingers
the whole glass panel sags bowing out around the bottom of the trailer
malcolm looks down and sees the satellite phone precariously balanced on one leg of the kitchen table its number pad still glowing green
nick is closest to it
grab the phone
looks to her right at a metal grating that runs along the wall of the trailer
she shifts her weight leaning on one hand to reach for the grating with the other
reaches for the satellite phone its antenna just six inches from his outstretched fingers
leans toward the metal grating all hairline cracks shoot out around her pivot hand shaking through the glass
the splintered glass spread like a disease it reaches the edge of the frame and her hand cracks right through the glass
she gasps and pulls her hand out but now she knees smash through the glass
has two fingers on the phone but suddenly the whole trailer shudders and the heavy phone tips off the table leg and falls
lunges for the metal grating and clings to it just as the heavy phone whizzes past her head and smashes into the glass opening up a huge hole in the
center of the back window
glass food lab equipment and the precious satellite phone fall out the broken window and smash on the rocks far below
the trailers are split like an l the rear trailer hanging straight down the forward one resting on the edge of the cliff
satisfied with their work the t rexes turn and lumber back into the jungle
sarah climbs carefully up the metal grating
above her nick lowers himself as far as he can reaching for her
we realize the hanging trailer halted its descent because one corner of it is wedged in the branches of a tree that grows out from the muddy cliff
but now those branches splinter
malcolm sees the bellows the connector between the trailers stretch as the lower trailer jerks and dips lower
sarah mountain climbs through the trailers kitchen inadvertently kicking the faucet on as she struggles for purchase
the tree branch snaps and the trailer jerks stretching down again
the bellows expands to its full length stretching like a slinky
nick knows he has to hurry
he climbs down bouncing off the built in furniture moving ever closer to sarah
but sarah slips and loses her grip dropping a few feet
she gabs hold of the sink the flowing water spraying her face
eddie carr is in the drivers seat of the jeep racing through the jungle as fast as he can
hang on hang on the foliage smacks the windshield then clears suddenly revealing the endangered trailers on the cliffside ahead of him
the jeep bounces through the deep footprints left by the rex and skids to a halt
sarah loses her grip on the sink and falls smashing into the frame of the half broken rear window again
eddie bolts out of the car and runs to the front trailer
he shouts in through the broken front window
the three look up from their precarious positions
eddie turns and run back to the jeep
he grabs a coil of rope secures one end around a tree and hurries back to the trailer
eddie dashes over the mess in the front trailer and crawls out into the extended connector
he peers over the edge down into the second trailer and tosses the rope
the rope falls through the center of the trailer its end dangling all the way out the smashed rear window
but the trailer shudders starting to move again
climbs up if you can
eddie runs out of the trailer in time to see the wheels dragging forward through the mud as the weight of the dangling trailer pulls the whole thing toward the
edge of the cliff
he runs for the jeep and grabs hold of the power winch on the front grill
behind him the trailer rolls closer to the edge of the cliff
eddie races back to the trailer pulling out a length of cable behind him
he runs up to the still moving trailer dives for its towing hook the cable goes taut and he falls short
just by six inches but hes out of cable
nick and sarah are now together clinging to the rope near the bottom of the trailer as it shifts around them
malcolm is further up also clinging to the rope
dirt and rocks pile up around the wheels and spill over the edge of the cliff
eddie back at the jeep reels out more winch cable
he turns and races back to the trailer just as gravity starts to lift eddie dives again and this time the cable hook clicks securely into the trailers towing hook
the trailer lurches toward the edge of the cliff and stops
but the jeep is jerked forward by the sudden pressure
malcolm clings to the rope in the middle of the trailer while nick and sarah try to struggle up it but a sudden dig knocks them back and their hands
slide down the line
screaming they slide through the trailer and their feet smash through the remains of the rear window
regaining hold of the rope at the very end the two of them now find themselves hanging out of the rear end of the trailer dangling over the rocky shore
eddie hits the gas and the tires slosh in the mud trying to get a grip
the jeep pulls just enough to lower the front trailer back to earth
but the tires spin fighting to hold it there
sarah and nick dangle desperate
eddie chunks the shifter into four wheel drive and guns the engine
as the motor roars the sound is topped by another roar in the distance
and this ones not a machine
but eddie doesnt hear it
he guns the engine again
there is another roar from the jungle
eddie hears this one
he darts a look at the side view mirror
in it he sees one of the tyrannosaurs bolt out of the jungle behind him
he gasps and looks at the other side view
in it he sees the other rex racing toward him
the tyrannosaurs stomp forward to confront the roaring jeep
the first rex bends over chomps down on the rear tire and lifts the car to its teeth
but the spinning tire lings in the rexs mouth burning it
surprised by the fight in this foe the rex loses its grip and the jeep bangs back down onto the ground
eddie horrified dives down under the steering wheel to get away
the gas pedal pops up which makes the trailer pitch over the side of the cliff
but the rex stomps down on the jeep to prevent its escape
the trailers stop
now the rexes lean down over the jeep and focus on eddie who still covers under the steering wheel
the first rex snaps at him hitting the steering column with it leaving eddie fully exposed
he screams and the second rex lashes in seizing him in its teeth and tossing him out of the car
eddie pops up into the air between the two rexes both their heads flash at him at the same time and in a split second he disappears between their teeth
now completely ignored the jeep rolls freely forward and the trailers drop over the edge of the cliff
nick sarah and malcolm cling to each other and the rope as the trailers fall around them
the windows flash by as the trailers plummet equipment bangs and scrapes them but they hold on to the rope still tied to the tree for dear life
the trailers slide the rest of the way exposing the three who pop out the space where the front windshield was
dangling from the rope they look up and see the jeep which is now rolling to the edge of the cliff
it falls past them and the whole mess explodes on the rocks below
finally it is silent except for the sound of the surf
its quiet up here too the rexes nowhere to be seen
at the cliff a hand appears from over the edge
sarah pulls herself up back onto solid ground then comes nick then both of them reach over and help malcolm up over the edge
they collapse there in the mud completely exhausted
he looks at the other two
they glance around then drop their heads
sarah hears a sound in the distance
from the edge of the jungle a cris cross of flashlight beams moves toward them
but rather than the three or four that would signify their own group there are nearly twenty of them
the hunters peter ludlow is in the lead roland and ajay with him
dieter is there too shepherding kelly and dr
juttson along in front of him
malcolm sees kelly they call out to each other and race together
malcolm falls to his knees and hugs her as tightly as he possibly can
are you all right
im fine im fine i was scared i thought you are you okay
roland looks around at the mess that was their base camp
mostly to himself thats what you think
in the ruins of the first teams base camp the survivors of the nights two separate catastrophes stand face to face in a heated argument
malcolm sits off to the side still holding kelly in his arms just looking down at the ground and shaking his head
theres something about his posture of defeat that is far more ominous than any of the hot tempers that are flaring
ludlow rants to sarah while dieter looms menacingly over nick
trespassing sabotage you could go to jail just for being here did you know that
dont start a legal argument with me this island isnt your property and neither are these animals
juttson has encountered dr
what are you doing here burke
theres no tv cameras whats the point
juttson you exist outside the classroom
i am amazed
dieter continues to get in nicks face
are you looking for a problem
an urgent whisper everyone keep your voices down
back off dieter
listen to me by moving the baby rex into our camp we changed the adults perceived territory
she understands oh god
thats why they persisted in destroying the trailers they now feel they have to defend this entire area
were not safe here
of sarah and nick thanks to you people
hey we came here to observe you came here to strip mine the place
its a looter mentality all you care about is what you can take
none of that matters
our communications equipments been destroyed
if your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff and im guessing by the look on his face he points at malcolm who is
still off to the side sitting in stunned silence
malcolm looks up and nods slowly
the grimness of their situation sinks in
roland contd we are stuck here ladies and gentlemen
and were stuck together
back in the hunters now demolished camp members of the two groups combine their diminished supplies
they have half a dozen large plastic containers of water thirty seven containers of food ranging from ziploc bags to aluminum tins a variety of weapons mot of them borne
on the hips or shoulders of the hunter team the charred and scraggly remnants of several pieces of now useless electrical equipment a flare gun and several flares somebodys tattered paperback crime and punishment a box of hershey bars and a cartoon of marlboros
roland supervises the assembling of the resources which are displayed in front of him
ludlow nick sarah juttson and malcolm who is still holding kelly close to him are with him
they hold their discussion in quiet tones
if we cant stay in the rexs territory we have to move tonight
our boats not coming for two days your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send ludlow refers to the charred and trampled satellite photographs of
the island which are still mostly legible
theres a communication center here in the old worker village
hammond put in some kind of renewable power source replenishing
it may still work
if we could get there we could send a radio call for the airlift
how far is the village
i said if we could get there
well how far is it
a days walk maybe more
thats not the problem
malcolm looks up sharply
ludlow contd our infrareds show their nesting sites are concentrated in the island interior
thats why we planned on keeping to the outer rim
malcolm shepherds kelly away from the conversation and mutters something to her quietly in the background
what are velociraptors
about six feet long three or four hundred pounds and very very fast
dieter brandishes his weapon
i think we can handle ourselves against them
malcolm rejoins the conversation alone
he keeps his voice low
im quite certain you cant
look we have two choices
we can hike back down to the lagoon where we can sit for two days in the open next to a heavily used water source while were waiting for your
boat to arrive or we can head for the village where we might find some shelter and we can call for help
wed never make it past the raptors
trust me i have some experience in this matter
roland looks at him
that may be
but you werent with me at the time
malcolm just shakes his head then turns and walks back to kelly
roland turns to the others
roland contd load up
lets get this moveable feast underway
the survivors set forth marching through the jungle in a column
two hunters strap on small shoulder mounted servo flashlights
wires run from the lights end in sensor pads which they stick to the skin of their necks
thus attached when the hunters turn their heads the servo lights turn with them illuminating whatever direction they look in
malcolm screws the barrel into the lindstradt rifle and slings it over his shoulder as he marches limping heavily
he looks down at kelly who is marching alongside him
his face shows the deepest of regret
he shakes his head cursing himself
he looks away as kelly looks up at him questioning
roland falls into step with malcolm and notices his limp
you all right
malcolm looks at him then looks away without answering
roland contd wrong question
you ever heard of gamblers ruin
a statistical phenomenon
says everything in the world goes in streaks
its real you see it everywhere in weather in river flooding in baseball in blackjack in stock markets
once things go bad they tend to stay bad
bad things cluster
they go to hell together
feeling a bit blue are we
malcolm glances at kelly who has taken a slightly faster pace and is a few steps ahead of them now
very deeply flawed
why did you come here
so that others would know about this place
why should they
because it exists
itll still exit if they go on not knowing wont it
and people will live in the absence of truth
so the truth is more important to you than your life
lowers is voice i dont care about my life
but if id ever thought for a second that she would be in danger roland follows his gaze forward to kelly whos about ten yards ahead now
kelly can hear their voices faint but clear
they are not as far away as they think they are
im afraid so
i dont know what the hell im doing with kids
i never should have had her
kellys face shows she heard that part
malcolm unaware continues with roland
malcolm contd why are you here
somewhere on this island there exits the greatest predator that ever lived
and the second greatest predator must take him down
you remember that guy about twenty years ago i forget his name but he climbed everest without any oxygen came down almost dead
and they asked him why did you go up there to die
and he said i didnt
i went up there to live
nods its called self testing
but in your case it sounds more like self destruction
a uniquely human characteristic
in fact human beings destroy things so well that i sometimes think thats our function
maybe every few sons some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world clears the decks and lets evolution proceed to his next phase
maybe death and destruction are our job maybe were supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that every person on the trail within earshot has stopped and is
staring at malcolm shaken by his words
roland grabs malcolm by the shirt collar and pulls him close growling in his ear
tell you what
you can see whatever you want to to me but you will not spew any more nihilist rants at anyone else in the group
im fighting panic and you push the wrong buttons
malcolm just blinks
this guys in charge
as a purple dawn dissolves the night sky the survivors stagger on exhausted
some are starting to tire and there are spaces in the column
malcolms limp seems to be getting worse
nick reaches out to take malcolms pack but malcolm swats his hand away
kelly still ahead of him falls into step with sarah
i dont think my dad doesnt think were going to make it
sarah looks at her
your dad is wrong
about a lot more than he knows
she puts an arm around her
kelly looks up at her grateful
the long march continues
nick catches up to roland
i think you should call a break
another half hour
some of them wont make another half hour
we didnt come this far to start dropping in the middle of the jungle
if you dont call it i will
roland looks at him steely then shouts to the group
immediately the marchers drop where they stood absolutely drained
burke and juttson are bickering
i cant believe youre still angry about that
you know its very easy to criticize the first person who studies something
no its easy to criticize sloppy research and hasty conclusions
malcolm checks nicks bag of videotapes making sure theyre still dry and undamaged
sarah comes up watching him
you know even if we do get those tapes back people are going to say its just another hoax
ian malcolms alien autopsy
ian they will misplace our evidence shoot holes in our testimony and say some special effects genius created the animals
the only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a t rex in the middle of times square
he doesnt look at her
she sits down beside her
sarah contd theres something more important that you should be thinking about instead
burke furious has stalked away from juttson and sits down on a rock
h does a double take noticing something behind the rock
he leans over and picks it up
its an oval shape about eight inches long with a pebbled exterior
a dinosaur egg
burkes face lights up fascinated and he carefully pieces the egg in a satchel he wears over one shoulder
dieter stark pulls a wad of toilet paper from his pack drops the pack on the ground and turns to the hunter nearest him carter his driver who has his
wait here for me would ya carter
he steps off the path into the jungle
but as we come around the front of carter we see hes wearing a walkman the headphone blaring tinnily in his ears
and he didnt hear a word
only a few feet off the path its primary forest the growth so thick that almost all sunlight is obscured
dieter claws forward until he finds a suitable spot to relieve himself
he clears away a bunch of leaves and debris and raises his hand to his belt buckle
he freezes hearing something we didnt
he glances around head darting alert to any danger
just a few distant animal calls and s scurrying around to his left
dieter snaps his head in that direction
at first he sees nothing but as he moves closer gun extended in front of him he sees a small dinosaur a compsograthus the same chicken sized animal cathy saw
on the beach so long ago
its not polite to he pulls the steel rod out of a loop in his belt and touches it to the compys back
the blue bolt of electricity cracks and dances over the compys body and it convulses in pain
dieter contd sneak up on people
the wounded compsognathus scurries back into the jungle whimpering
dieter clambers through the foliage ten or twelve paces pushes aside two large palm fronds and steps out into more jungle
he stops puzzled not sure if he went back or forward
he looks behind him
he pauses recalculating the path he took coming into the jungle muttering to himself gesturing with his hands retracing his steps
he adjusts his angle slightly to the right and heads off in that direction
but after five or six hard fought steps he stops again
still nothing but jungle
dieters cries are faint but audible
the only marchers hear enough to hear him is carter but the walkman is blaring in his ears
dieter hears that scurrying sound again this time from his right
he adjusts his angle again and scrapes through the foliage moving faster and faster
panicking he ties to run but the roots rise high out of the ground in the jungle and he trips on one and falls flat on his face
he looks up
the scurrying sound comes again this time ten times louder than before like a hundred feet coming at him
dieter gasps as something rushes in at him
he whirls to his right
whatever it is rushes in from that side as well
and the left
and behind him
dieter scrambles up into a sitting position and laughs
he is surrounded by at least forty compys now the same as the one he wounded
for a long moment they just stare at him
slowly he brings his gun around to point it at them
easy wait one more sec as one the compys shriek and hurl themselves forward covering dieters body
their teeth and claws flash as they each try to grab a scrap of his flesh tearing savagely
dieter screams and flails waving his arms and legs wildly
some of the tiny animals lose their grip and sail off smashing into trees or the ground
but dozens of others hang on and dieter falls over backwards now lying on his back on the ground
hysterical he fights like hell to get to his feet screaming shaking swatting the compys loose
he spins and that tactic seems to work as the compys themselves begin to panic and drop off of him
but he also loses his grip on his weapon which goes flying landing in the thick foliage five or six feet from him
losing the attack the compys turn and dart away en masse stopping ten yards away from him
but they turn and regroup facing him in a line hopping up and down chirping and shrieking
dieter bounds into the foliage looking for his gun
but the compys follow him in and hes forced to flee abandoning his lost weapon
ten feet on he stops knowing hes screwed without the gun
he turns to face the pursuing compys
dieter charges them shouting waving his arms
the compys turn and run
the compys stop
they stare back at him
there is a moment of quiet then they start to hop again chirping and dieter tired of this game turns and runs away
the compys follow
from the front of the convoy roland shouts out
breaks over move on
the exhausted marchers drag themselves back to their feet and start to march again
at the rear of the group someone taps carter who is still listening to his music
carter gets up hoists his backpack and marches away
behind him dieters pack is left forgotten on the jungle trail
dieter stumbles along exhausted
he reaches the edge of a stream that runs under the foliage and his feet slip on the stones
he falls into the rocky stream
behind him the army of compys pours over the little hill he just crested
they disappear for a moment down an incline and then swarm over his body
in a frenzy of splashing dieter shrugs them off and crawls away through the stream
he gets to his feet but falls again this time over a log
a geyser of water splashes up in the air behind the log as dieter drops out of sight
the compys leap over the log and disappear from view too throwing up their own splashes of water
screeching chirping and the sound of tearing flesh mixes with dieters now as more compys leap over the log and splash into the water below the geysers that shoot up
into our field of view are pink
and then theyre a deep deep red
the group has stopped again
near the rear sarah nick malcolm ludlow and roland are in a tense conversation with how long ago was this
seven eight minutes
roland looks at them thinking
finally then hes dead
nobody tells the little girl
last thing we need is screaming hysterics
he turns and heads back to the front of the column
we have to send someone to look for him
you go if you like but were not waiting for you
move it out
they look at each other appalled but the column starts to move
numbed shocked but left with no choice they move on one by one
the column of marchers has finally reached the island ridge where they are silhouetted against the setting sun
theyre taking a break sprawled out on rocks or over the ground
malcolm sits next to kelly whos sitting on a log
she doesnt look at him just gets up and walks away going to sit over next to sarah
malcolm watches pained but sarah puts an arm around her and makes a shes okay gesture to malcolm
roland steps up to the very edge and peers into the island interior
from his vantage point hes able to see all the way to the far side of the island a rim of herd black cliff miles away
between here and the cliffs there is nothing but gently undulating jungle
he refers to one of the satellite recon photos
looks like the worker village is down in there about a mile and a half northeast from the base of these cliffs
malcolm is next to him
there must be a game trail some kind of path that goes down there
roland looks around at the exhausted marchers
theyll have to rest before we look for it
then we hit it
the group has made camp in the jungle
the mood is somber most of the marchers asleep already
three or four tents have been put up
kelly sits quietly in a corner her eyes wide knees hugged up to his chest
sarah comes in
there you are
your dads looking for you
i doubt that
sarah takes off her outer shirt and hangs it over a bar to dry the broad red smear across its front
oh come on
go talk to him
he likes to be alone
i can stay with you
all is still
the nocturnal jungle hoots and buzzes around the sleeping marchers
in his tent roland abruptly sits up
as if he heard something
he looks out the open flap
in the middle of the campsite he sees ajay stop in his tracks head cocked
roland gets up and goes outside joining ajay in the middle of the camp
you hear something
i feel something
roland looks at him
this isnt so good
he looks out at the shifting jungle
he notices a thin plume of smoke rising up over the trees just barely outside the edge of camp
kelly and sarah have laid down on top of sleeping bags trying to get a few minutes rest
sarahs shirt hangs over them swaying in the gentle breeze coming through the open flap
as the shirt dangles there swinging softly from side to side we notice the broad red smear across the front
oh thats right its blood
the baby t rexs blood
the thin plume of smoke leads down to a tiny cooking fire thats been lit by dr
hes set a small frying pan on top of it and now he cracks the dinosaur egg he picked up earlier into the pan
roland and ajay run up behind him
hisses burke leaps out of the way as roland kicks dirt on the fire
roland ajay and burke all freeze
what was that
sarah and kelly sit up
they felt it too
get my weapon
ajay turns and trots away a few steps then stops cold staring down at the ground
a recent rain has all left puddles scattered around the camp and impact tremors now create ripples in the puddles concentric circles spreading to the outer edges
sarah and kelly are frantically sealing up any opened food into ziploc bags
now they leap into sarahs sleeping bag to seal themselves and draw the zipper up all the way around
outside the silhouette of the rexs head passes by the tent
sarah works faster her fingers struggling to close the last few inches but the rex head pokes through the flap of the tent
it sniffs snorting the air in and out
it looks around the tent
it sniffs sarahs hanging shirt the one that is stained with the blood of the baby tyrannosaur
the adult tyrannosaur gurgles again cooing and cocking its head curiously
in the sleeping bag sarah and kellys eyes are barely visible wide in panic
the rex sniffs and nudges the bag trying to figure out what this thing is
it rolls the bag over once decides its uninteresting and then rises straights up taking the whole tent with it
the stakes pop out of the ground as the tent rises high up into the air and flutters away leaving the sleeping bag fully exposed on the ground beneath it
the second tyrannosaur now steps out of the jungle joining the first
panic hits the camp as the sleeping hunters wake up
many of them start to run
roland scrambles toward his tent where he can see his weapon lying near the open flap
as he draws close an enormous t rex foot stomps down on the tent driving the rifle deep into the mud
roland weaponless stands frozen watching as the panicked hunters flee in all directions
but they ignore him sweeping him up in the wave of flushed prey that pours across the campsite
some toss random and ill aimed gunshots back at the rexes
nick bursts out of the crowd sees kelly and sarah struggling to get out of the sleeping bag and grabs each by an arm
he rips them to their feet and sweeps them off ahead of him into the jungle
malcolm blinking back sleep stands a good head above the rest of the panicking crowd
frantically he scans the group
but he cant see her
the two rexes join forces herding the fleeing hunters into a narrow ravine
roland scrambles up a steep rock face
no way in hell hes going down that ravine
he sees malcolm still in the middle of the camp start to head for the ravine
malcolm runs over and hurls himself at the rock face scrambling to climb up the smooth steep boulders
behind him one of the rexes spots him and lunges across the camp toward him
roland contd malcolm gives it everything hes got clawing his way up the rock face and rex draws closer and pounces at his legs and roland reaches down grabs malcolm
by the hair and pulls him up out of the rexs grasp
the rex falls short but hes close enough that we can hear his teeth snap together closing around nothing but air
it turns sees easier prey in the fleeing hunters and takes off after them
malcolm lands on top of the rock ledge with a crunch
roland unceremoniously dumps a fistful of hair in his lap
kelly in the middle of the fleeing crowd with sarah and nick hears her father screaming her name and looks up
malcolm and roland are on the rock ridge above them keeping pace
shouting but kelly continues to flee as the rexes are in the ravine now and drawing closer to the group
some hunters try to leap up and scale the rocks but the ravine is deepening theres no way out
one rex grabs hold of a hunter in its teeth and hurls him against the rock face
the second rex picks up another hunter and snaps its massive head left and right quickly to break its victims neck
the hunter goes flying forward and crashes into carter dieters driver who stumbles and falls
the rest of the fleeing humans run around or over him but when the rex lifts its foot we see carter is actually stuck to the bottom of it and
when the animal takes its next step it crushes him into the earth
malcolm is frantic
i gotta get down there
its obvious no one is going to outrun the rexes and nick knows it
he bursts ahead of sarah and kelly and spots something off to his left
its a waterfall apparently right in front of a sheer rock face
but theres something about the way the water is falling that tells him something
he grabs each of them and hauls them forward running straight at the waterfall
apparently he intends to jump right into the rock and hes dragging them along with him
the three of them spring right at the waterfall and disappear through the water
burke fleeing along with everyone else is watching as they vanish
there is a small recess which is what nick had hoped for
its small only four or five feet deep but its just enough for him sarah and kelly to cover behind the flowing water
breathless terrified they can hear the mayhem outside
with an enormous splash something bursts through the cascading water and crashes into them
get out of the way
he pulls his way up against the far wall as far away from the water as he can
now another shape bursts through the watery curtain
a tyrannosaur head
burke gave away the hiding spot
the four scream as the rexs jaws snap left and right searching for them falling just inches short
they squeeze as far back against the wall as they can get
the rex cant quite get its head all the way through the opening so it uses its tongue
a long dark blue shape slithers out of its mouth and touches the humans trying to wrap around them to pull them out of the cave
burke blind with panic forces himself even further into the cave which pushes kelly further out
but burke doesnt listen throwing elbows to make room for himself
his movements dislodge a portion of muddy earth and a flurry of enormous cockroaches eight or nine inches long each pour out of the wall and swarm over his face
burke screams and instinctively leaps away toward the flowing water
and thats all the leverage the rex needs
it curls its tongue wrapping burke up in it and pulling him between its teeth
screaming hideously he is dragged out through the waterfall and disappears
sarah nick and kelly stare in horror as the white screen of water turn pink
malcolm and roland see the rex walk away from the waterfall with burke leaving the hiding place unmolested
malcolm is nearly hysterical
theyll stay in there shes okay
routed hunters emerge from the gully at the edge of he jungle
ahead of them there is a large open plain covered by long elephant grass
ajay running along with them stops abruptly at the edge of the grass shouting to the others
not in the frenzy they ignore him
behind ajay the enormous shadows of the two pursuing tyrannosaurs stop as well holding up at the edge of the jungle
ajay torn between a sense of responsibility and his better judgement opts for the former and races into the grass after the other hunters waving his arms
roland and malcolm come out onto a rocky ledge that has a view of the plain below
roland can see the hunters leaving trails as they plow through the grass
the groups of hunters wades into the middle of the long grass
one of them stops and turns looking back at the jungle trees
they gave up
theyre not chasing us
there are cheers sighs of relief
in the distance ajays voice can be heard faintly calling to them to come back
up on the rock in the distance they can see roland waving his arms madly
but in the giddiness of their escape they pay it no mind
they continue plowing into the high grass anything to get further away from the tyrannosaurs
the tops of three animal heads rise up slowly backlit by the full moon
in the distance the heads can seethe hunter party
the heads descend back into the grass
they continue forward oblivious
now behind them four more heads rise up in the grass
as then descend
on all sides of the hunters the grass ripples as animals move forward toward them undetected inexorable as torpedoes
and these torpedoes are on target
one hunter is suddenly dragged down yanked silently below the surface of the tall grass
in his place a long lizard like tail rises up as the animal drops its head to make the kill
behind him two more hunters are taken down and two more animal tails rise up in their place
a hunter ahead hears the rustling and turns
his face turns white as behind him a velociraptor springs out of the grass
velociraptor runs upright on its powerfully muscled hind legs the second tow of each foot bearing an extra large curved claw carried in a retracted position with which it slashes
this raptor snarls and slams into the body of the hunter taking him down
a feeding frenzy ensues
the hunters run in all directions but are pulled down and vanish into the twitching long grass
another raptor enters from the right leaps high into the air past the full moon slams into the chest of more human prey and takes him down into the grass
behind them ajays face falls defeated
he looks around realizing he too is now stranded in the middle of the long grass
around him four torpedo trails head straight for him
ajay simply closes his eyes
roland turns away from the carnage pained
sarah malcolm kelly nick roland dr
juttson and peter ludlow stand in the ruins of their campsite their ranks decimated spirits shattered
roland is at the hole in the ground where his tent once was
he has pulled his
nitro express from the mud and more or less cleaned it now hes checking the loads
kelly nearly catatonic with fear clings to sarah and it doesnt look as if shell ever let go
malcolm who is on his knees picking through the wreckage of a tent looks over at them but sarah waves him off shes okay
roland appears standing over the group
he looks at malcolm who has found the lindstradt rifle intact
how many rounds did you find for that weapon
four counting the one in the chamber
dont let it out of your hands again
to sara but looking at kelly can the kid walk
can the kid walk
i can walk
while he addresses the group roland straps on one of the servo lights the shoulder mounted flashlights that follow your gaze
were going to find a path down into the interior of the island
load up whatever you think you need and i mean need
if you cant carry it indefinitely dont bring it
well hit the worker village in a couple hours and be out of here before dawn
roland bends over one of the three toed footprints left by the rex
behind him the rest of the group is packing up slinging the remnants of their equipment over their shoulders
roland bends over and sniffs the footprint
its filled with a liquid of some kind
he takes his canteen dumps the remaining water into the ground and plunges the canteen into the footprint filling it
ludlow hovers over his shoulder
what is that
ludlow doesnt ask
roland stares down at the ashes of the cooking fire that led to such disaster
he grabs a handful of the ash and shoves it in his pants pocket
roland and ludlow who along with sarah and malcolm is also wearing a servo light now maneuver down a rugged hillside and come out in a flattened area
ludlow gasps looking ahead in wonderment
malcolm breaks through the hillsides foliage a moment later
he too stares in amazement
sarah and kelly come next then nick then juttson
one by one they all stop and stare
god help us
theyre standing in a flat sandy area lined with boulders at the sides
the flat area stretches fifty yards from side to side and as far as they can see ahead
but thats not what amazes them so
everywhere the sand is dotted with dinosaur skeletons
some are huge apatosaurs sixty feet from head to tail tip
others are smaller herbivores of many different kinds
the more intact skeletons lie on their sides their ribcages arcs of pale bone
but just as many have been ripped apart bits of carcass tossed in every direction
i do not feel lucky
they march on tiny figures moving among the mountainous skeletons by the light of the full moon
roland notices one carcass in particular a recent kill
its an enormous hadrosaur with fresh bites taken out of it
he bends down studying the soft earth around it for footprints
malcolm looks up noticing the bony shapes around them which fall in heavy shadows like cell bars seem to be changing
he turns and his servo light shines on the bones
but theyre not bones any more at all theyre pipes the animal graveyard now given over to the lifeless skeletons of manmade objects twisted rotting machinery
we made it
they hurry over a small rise and find themselves at the edge of what was once isla sornas worker village
the size of a football field the town is divided by a main street thats dotted on both sides by stores residences cafes a gas station
all the way at the far end is a large blocky four story building
but the town is a mess
the hurricane that hit here must have been ferocious for everywhere things are smashed broken upended
and the jungle has stepped into the breath growing up around and over everything
huge root systems snake through the street making it almost impassable
its always ready to return
roland catches up and looks at ludlow
wheres the power and radio setup
far end of the street
a light rain falls as they start down the street carefully silently roland and malcolm with their weapons at the ready
they pass the skeleton of a fallen water tower
an empty gas station its vine snarled pumps now useless
the only sound is the low mechanical hum of the servo lights as they follow the groups gazes obediently
every few feet the group encounters strange grayish lumps that lies in random places in the middle of the street
malcolm curious stops and taps one of them
its a rock hard
nick looks over his shoulder
what are they
i dont know
finally they reach the operation building at the far end of the town
the radio rig is inside
it runs directly from the geothermal generator so power shouldnt be a problem
he pulls out his canteen
ludlow watches as he screws the top off moves toward the building and starts splashing the contents on the outside of it
the rest of the group just stares at him
whats he got in there
dont ask me
the guys completely out to lunch
what in gods name would he want with roland rejoins them
i dont want anything to do with it and neither does any other animal on this island
this building is now demarcated as the rexs territory
as long as you stay in that building youll all be safe until the helicopter comes
he drops his pack swings his gun off his shoulder and checks the load
juttson looks fearful
where are you going
after the rex
i saw a fresh kill back in the valley with tyrannosaur tracks all around it
if im not back in time dont wait for me
youve got to be kidding
runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait
do you think the rex might have the infant with it
ludlow takes off his hat and turns to nick
you know how to work a radio dont you
youre going too
i lost everything i came after on this trip but one t rex in one theme park could single handedly bail ingen out of chapter
he takes a slip of paper from the brim of his hat and hands it to nick
ludlow contd this is the broadcast frequency
id yourself as harvest leader
you know what to tell em
you gentlemen feel you have to do this now
nows the perfect time
the animal just fed so it wont stalk us for food
predators dont hurt when theyre not hungry
ludlow double checks the clip on his semi automatic rifle no
and smacks it back into the belly of the gun
nick contd only humans do
the console of a sophisticated radio set up glows brightly all green red and yellow
nick tunes the dial to a specific frequency
the radio whines and hisses tuning in
into microphone cq cq
this is ingen operation harvest leader to harvest base
come in please
the remaining survivors minus ludlow and roland shine their flashlights around the dusty vine hung interior of the communications room
on the wall a row of chrome letters says we make the future but the words are obscured by a tangle of vines
mushrooms and fungi sprout from the carpet
on one wall there is a mural of what the completed jurassic park would have looked like
big hotels ford explorers with tourists leaning out the windows taking pictures big crowds at the fences around the animal exhibits
but none of it came true and now even the mural is runny and dust covered
there is a pause filed only with radio static
sarah looks at nick tensely waiting
finally a voice comes over the radio clean as can be
go ahead harvest leader
they all breath a sign of relief
with roland and ludlow gone on the hunt and the rest of the group inside the operations building main street stands deserted and silent
nearly deserted anyway
moonlight shadows lengthen at one end of the street and five velociraptors stroll into town
roland and ludlow are back in the valley of death standing amid the giant skeletons of long dead animals
roland bends down checking the carcass of the freshly chewed hadrosaur he saw earlier
a set of giant three toed rex tracks leads away from the carcass down the stream bed
roland follows them
ludlow follows roland
as they near a bend in the stream roland looks down at the surface of the water
a pattern of ripples moves toward them washing over their ankles
roland follows the ripples with his eyes
from up head around the bend he can hear the sound of an animal eating and drinking
a very large animal
he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a pinch of the ashes from the cooking fire that he scooped up earlier and releases that on the wind
they float there for a second suspended then blow back at him
roland darts a contemptuous look at him
he puts a finger to his lips gesturing for silence then steps up onto the shore
they creep forward toward the sounds
they round the bend and roland hits his belly edging up over a small rise
over the rise he sees the tyrannosaur about a hundred yards ahead
its stooped over the stream bed drinking
like a bird it dips its head in the water and then straightens up to let the water fall down its throat
a dozen compys are at the water as well drinking
roland gently flicks the safety on his gun to off
ludlow edges toward the cover of a low hanging branch
as he puts his weight on one knee it presses down hard on the middle of a small stick which cracks in half
roland turns eyes blazing
out in the open the tyrannosaur snaps its head sharply as well staring in the direction of the sound
but since rolands own head is turned he doesnt see the dinosaurs reaction
roland holds a warning finger out to ludlow
roland turns his head back
the tyrannosaur is gone
the trail of three toed tyrannosaur footprints stops abruptly
roland stops too gesturing for ludlow to freeze behind him
roland glances both ways looking for any sign of the track
to the right the ground gives way to hard black volcanic rock
a short distance behind them the rock is solid a massive green pebbled boulder ten feet high
roland frowns and whispers in ludlows ear again
we took to the rock
in front of roland a palm frond sways gently in the night breeze
rolands eyes widen
he pulls out another pinch of campfire ash and releases it on the wind
this time the ash blows off straight away from him
they freeze terrified
behind them the enormous green pebbled boulder opens an eye
thats no boulder thats the male tyrannosaur standing rock solid still its natural camouflage blending into the surrounding foliage perfectly
very slowly and almost silently the rex brings its head all the way around until it is staring directly down at them from about ten feet away
roland and ludlow stand frozen their back to the rex unaware of its presence
until it exhales
the soft snort of its breath isnt quite audible but it brushes the hair on the backs of their necks ever so slightly
their hearts drop into their stomachs
ludlow speaks his voice a queasy hiss
the very softest whisper its just fed
it wont attack unless its threatened
as the rex silently cocks its head sizing up the danger from these intruders it breathes again
a few strands of ludlows hair flap in the exhalation
he closes his eyes near tears
he cant take it
his eyes dart glancing down at the weapon he holds in his hands
unfortunately its extended in front of him away from the rex
he risks another hiss
if i dont move i cant shoot it
let it go peter
the animal won
behind them the rex appears satisfied
it starts to swing its massive head around back toward the jungle
it lifts one great leg and takes a step into the trees
roland signs and closes his eyes relieved
but ludlow seizes the opportunity
he whips his weapon around and drops to one knee
roland contd the rex is infinitely quicker
ludlow just has time to squeeze off a short burst of semi automatic gunfire when the animal whirls takes one elegant step forward and pounces
ludlows bullets rip harmlessly through the foliage between the rexs legs as its big head snaps forward and comes down jaws wide
they close around ludlows body lift his straight up into the air and toss him once readjusting their grip so it is firmly around his midsection
the whole combination of movements takes but half a second
by the time roland turns around the animal has pivoted and darted back into the jungle carrying ludlow still screaming and writhing in its mouth
roland raises his gun to draw a bead on the animal but through the shivering trees he can only see that the tyrannosaur is gone
malcolm sarah nick kelly and dr
juttson wait nervously in the communications room
an empty can of dr
pepper sitting on one of the countertops begins to rattle
they look over at it confused as the lightweight aluminum can chatters on the formica counter
other objects in the lab begin to rattle too
glass jars clank against one another books start to drop off the shelves a stool shudders across the floor
whats going on
above them the rotting wooden roof of the building starts to actually tear away chunks of moldy timber flying up into the night
they look up a deafening roar fills the room and a helicopters searchlight floods in
as the chopper dips lower looking for a place to land the violent prop wash rips away huge chunks of the roof over their heads
up above the operations building the helicopter circles
the roof of the building is all arches and rotten timber impossible to land open
below the pilots see the survivors through the torn roof of the building
they wave frantically their flashlight beams piercing the night sky
there they are
the co pilot scans the street below but its choked with overturned cars and fallen trees
no lz in the street too much debris
check the other buildings
the co pilot nods and they peel off swooping over the rest of the village
at the far end of the street the co pilot brings the searchlight to bear on the large flat roof of a three story building
the pilot gives him a thumbs up
malcolm sarah kelly nick and finally dr
juttson run out the front of the operations building
at the end of the street they can see the helicopter as it descends slowly over the building to land on its roof
there it is
happily the group double times it down the street headed for the chopper
again those strange rock formations are everywhere
some seem to be on the sides of buildings as if they once dripped there and then turned to stone
this time sarah pauses at one that is dripping over to the side of a car like solidified lava
her face falls as a thought occurs to her
theyre dried birdshit
a velociraptors jumps onto a fallen tree trunk behind them
they dont see it
unaware of the raptors presence they resume their trot toward the helicopter
behind them the raptor crouches and snarls but the sound is lost under the whine of the helicopters engines
it springs covering the distance between them quickly
the animal slams into juttson the last person in the group and takes him down
juttson is thrown forward into the others who fall like dominoes
juttson screams his voice an unnatural high pitched squeal as the raptor flips him over and lowers its jaws into him
sarah looks up panicked
her eyes widen at the sight of a second raptor this one running straight at hr at top speed
she buries her face in the dirt covering her head with her hands and the raptors foot slams into the ground between her legs as it bounds over her and
dives onto juttson joining the first raptor in the kill
panicked the group scatters in all directions
kelly jumps up and scrambles into the middle of the street where she hits the dirt and crawls under a fallen shed in the middle of the road
malcolm rolls over to the space where kelly was but shes gone now
he looks around frantically
sarah rolls onto her feet and sprints toward the building nearest her
behind her a third raptor gives chase bounding after her with horrifying speed
sarah runs flat out but her speed is nothing compared to the raptors and it gains on her rapidly
the walls of a structure of some kind close in around sarah and as she leaps across a leather seat and slams a door behind her we realize shes crawled
into the back seat of an abandoned car
but the car door is thin protection against the charging raptor which slams into the window head first
the window spinderwebs but does not yield
the raptor crumples to the ground
sarah looks up through a three inch hole in the middle of the web
the raptor leaps back to its feet and plunges its nose into the tiny hole thrashing widening it
sarah screams and the animal forces its entire head through the hole snapping its jaws just short of her face
she hurls herself over the seat and into the front as the animal penetrates even further into the car but its torso will not fit through the window opening
it pulls away
in the front seat sarah gets some very bad news
theres no windshield
the raptor springs up onto the hood its claws clattering on the sheet metal and tosses its body through the opening just as sarah hurls herself out the door
while the raptor struggles to right itself in the front seat sarah runs to the nearest building ducks inside and slams the heavy wooden door
malcolm races between the idled gas pumps and into the gas station building closing the door behind him
a moment later a raptor bounds after him slamming into the door
meeting resistance it bounces off notices the plate glass window next to the door and pounces at that
the window shatters and the raptor clings to the ledge staring inside its tail hanging out
just as it gets inside malcolm opens the door and comes back out keeping the place of wall between them
he pulls the lindstradt rifle off his back and tries to take aim but the raptor whirls and springs forcing him back inside through the door again
willing to play along the raptor turns and jumps through the window again
balancing on the window frame the raptor hisses and crouches ready to spring at malcolm
malcolm takes cover behind the door which is hanging open between them
he raises the rifle
th raptor springs into the door blasting it off its hinges knocking malcolm right through a window behind him
but the door smacks up against the wall covering the window preventing the raptor from following malcolm out that way
for the moment
malcolm flies through the window and crunches to the ground
he groans in agony and rolls off his bad leg which is twisted unnaturally beneath him and claws in the mud for the gun
rough hands reach down grab him by the shirt and haul him to his feet
he drags malcolm away but in the commotion nicks duffel slips off his shoulder and lands in the street spilling some of the precious videotapes
malcolm scoops them up
shes with sarah
they race off down the street
high above sarah we see she is standing alone in a three story kiln house a windowless shed used for firing pottery and other construction projects
catwalks lined with heavy chains hang above her and onto the floor below she turns in circles wondering what to do now
from outside the kiln house she hears scratching digging sounds
from the other side of the door comes an animal snort and a small puff of dust and dirt billows up through the crack along the ground
the claws of one of the raptors dig furiously trying to tunnel underneath
sarah runs to the opposite wall falls to her knees and starts digging a tunnel of her own clawing frantically at the ganging tools always and clanks as it tears
at the earth below it
sarah digs faster
so does the raptor
with about eight inches of space under the wall sarah grabs hold of the bottom of one of the plans and pries it up as hard as she can
it snaps off with a loud crack
at the door the raptor stops digging
its silent for a moment
sarah has a good foot and a half of space under her wall now
she starts to lower her body into it sarah falls back screaming leaps to her feet and jumps up grabbing hold of one of the catwalks above
she starts to climb up anywhere up as the raptor now squirms and thrashes its way inside coming in through her hole
sarah climbs hauling herself up leaping from one catwalk to another
the raptor leaps up onto a catwalk as well and follows her
a window in the slanted roof of the kiln house explodes in a shower of glass as sarah kicks through it and climbs outside
nick drags a badly limping malcolm down the main street
they can see helicopter at the far end engine roaring and searchlight playing over them as they draw closer
they approach a rusted abandoned pickup in the middle of the street and a raptor leaps on top of it
its claws clack on the roof as it goes into its pre attack crouch
they dont stick around to negotiate
nick hauls malcolm off into the nearest building
nick and malcolm hurry inside and slam the door behind them
theyre standing in the lobby of a hotel of some kind probably used for overnight guests and day workers who had to spend the night
the room and staircase wind around a large open aired central area four stories tall
they shout at each other frantic
we cant stay in here
were sure as hell not going back out there this is single wall construction
its just a shack
for sixty seconds maybe
look at this
raps on the door with his knuckles you could with a crash the wood sprinters around the lock and the door swings open violently
malcolm is thrown aside landing hard on the floor
a velociraptor stands hissing in the doorway
nick throws his weight against the door
slamming it hard against the raptor
malcolm rolls over and paws the gun off his back
the raptor charges the door again this time blasting it off its hinges knocking nick to the floor beneath it
the raptor turns and snarls at malcolm
malcolm swings the gun around the raptor lunges at him malcolms finger closes on the trigger and the raptor lands on top of him
the weight of the animal crushes him into the floor but the gun barrel now stands between them
the raptor chomps down hard on the barrel its teeth grinding on the metal and snaps its head to tear it from malcolms hands
malcolm pulls the trigger
the raptors eyes pop wide as the dart slams into the back of its throat
it makes a gurgling sound then convulses violently and rolls off of malcolm yanking the gun from his hands as it falls and dies
nick scrambles out from under the door
malcolm tries to wrench the gun from the raptors clenched jaws but it wont budge
helping him out head for the roof
i have to find kelly
i think shes with sarah
kelly remains huddled under the fallen shed trembling with fear
she holds her breath and freezes as just outside only two feet from where shes hiding a raptors feet pick their way past her down the middle of the street
kelly closes her eyes and suppresses a scream
nick and malcolm burst onto the roof of the now burning hotel and slam the door behind them
the helicopter is now only three rooftops away
they turn and head for it nick in the lead but theres an eight foot gap between the buildings
its too wide
nick looks around desperate
a fallen power pole leans against the building theyre standing on its lines gone slack
help me push this
he and nick throw a shoulder into the pole and give it a mighty push tipping it over in the other direction
one good hard shove and it falls to the far building thudding against it solidly
its power lines are not taut a lifeline from this rooftop to the next
nick grabs hold and starts to pull himself across the gap hand over hand
behind them the door of the building splinters and crashes open as a raptor throws all its weight into it
malcolm leaps onto the power line without hesitation and starts pulling himself across
but even with the door wide open the raptor on the other side hesitates
it snarls and backs away refusing to come out onto the roof
malcolm lands next to nick on the second rooftop
they look back at the frightened animal which takes tow steps out onto the roof snarls and backs into the doorway again
its afraid to come onto the roof
malcolm looks around at the rooftop
strange bits of scrap and debris seem to have been arranged there in an odd concentric pattern
he points to the roof of the kilm house in the distance
malcolm turns and sees sarah crawling across the tile
his face turns white
sarah has problems
still on top of the kilm house she reaches the edge and pushes off the roof leaping to the roof of the next building
she lands at the peak of the intersection of the two sides of sloping roof
as she pulls herself up a raptor appears on the rooftop behind her
in full stride it leaps sails over her and lands on the roof ahead of her
sarah swings to her left and starts to crawl down the slope away from the raptor
suddenly the roof board under her sprinters and cracks under her weight
the whole section pulls up and starts to slide off the roof
sarah clinging to it rides the roof planks down away from the raptor
she looks over her shoulder down and sees another raptor waiting for her on the roof of the building below
sarah quickly rolls off the sliding section of roof which keeps sliding falling
the raptor below jumps up just in time to get whacked in the head by the falling roof section
sarah tries to cling to the spanish tile roof fingers and nails slipping on the slick ceramic surface
she slides all the way to the edge grabs hold of the gutter and dangles there suspended above one raptor and trapped below another
the raptor above works its way down
the one below leaps up at her dangling legs
she has left them in time with its jumps to avoid losing her feet
this cant go on for long
desperate she pulls one of the spanish tiles up from the roof and hurls it at the raptor below
it hits the animal in the head for all the good that does
but sarah keeps on pulling and throwing more tiles
she edges to the right toward a fresh supply
the raptor above edges even closer claws clicking on the slick roof
something interesting is happening
as sarah pulls the loose tiles free the ones above slide down to take their place
sarah sees this and pulls more free knocking them out of the way as fast as she can
suddenly an avalanche of loose tiles breaks loose and the footing underneath the raptor above disintegrates
the animals feet flail and grasp it slides towards the edge amid the tumbling tiles
sarah seeing it coming swings in close to the building hugging it as closely as she can
the raptor falls off the roof right past her and crunches into the raptor below
both animals snark and attack one another
now sarah her grip exhausted falls too landing right next to the enraged animals
they fight and roll right over her
she groans and hugs the wood below her the raptors continue to thrash and bite they roll back toward her she rolls out of their way and plunges through a
hole in the roof
sarah falls through the roof of a deserted laboratory and lands in the tray of an old fashioned hanging fluorescent light fixture
one end of the fixtures support snaps it drops at a degree angle sarah slides out the other end and crashes through a window
sarah lands in the mud in the street below
with a thud malcolm lands in the mud between two other building one of which he has just climbed off of
panicked he leaps to his feet and starts to shout
sarah sprints down the main street as fast as she can toward the building on which sits the helicopter
above her she can see nick has now reached the helicopter and is waving to her
sarah reaches the fallen water tower which is next to the helicopter building and starts to climb it
kelly is still covering underneath the fallen shed
in the distance she can see the helicopter
but she is trembling with fear unable to move
the whole shed suddenly rattles as something heavy hits it outside
kellys mouth drops open to scream but her terror is so complex that no sound comes out
she raises her hands in self defense whatevers outside roars with effort the entire shed is suddenly ripped right up off of her and she looks up into her fathers
he grabs her by the hand and they take off down the street
sarah emerges at the top of the water tower structure and leaps onto the roof into nicks arms
eyes wide with panic they both turn and look down at the street below where they see kelly and malcolm racing at top speed down the middle of the street
malcolm and kelly have a twenty yard advantage on the animal
theyre pretty fast but its faster
above them nick and sarah are at the edge of the roof shouting and urging them on
they push it faster
they reach the base of the fallen water tower the jumble of struts and metal poles that sarah climbed
kelly leaps ahead of him and grabs hold of one of the poles pulling herself neatly up to her feet and reaching for the next one
malcolm stretches and makes the same effort but for him its much harder
below them the raptor springs and slams into the struts shaking the whole structure
it pulls itself up
higher up kelly climbs fast hands gliding over the poles
she breaks out into the open where a long narrow pole runs on a slight incline up to the roof
she scampers across it running the balance beam
she reaches the other side on a ledge below the roofline and looks back
malcolm is at the other end hesitating drained breathing hard
below him the raptor closes in
malcolm sets out across the beam his legs shaking
he places his feet carefully he doesnt have nearly the balance kelly did
the raptor draws closer
kelly contd malcolm slips
one foot twists right off the bar and he spins arms flailing trying to regain his tenuous balance
but he overcompensates and his whole body wrenches out from under him
he falls the bar smacks him hard in the chest knocking the wind out of him and he drops flipping right off the bar and bouncing painfully through the maze
of bars below
he drops right past the pursuing velociraptor crunching to a halt in a nest of bars ten feet off the ground probably cracking a rib
kelly screams from above him
kelly contd she stares down in horror at her father
wrenched in among the bars malcolm is helpless as the animal crouches only six feet above him now with an open attack route
the animal snarks and goes into its pre attack crouch
up above kelly wipes the palms of her hands on her jeans and leaps out into space grabbing hold of one of the bars
the raptor springs
kelly spins around over the top of the bar and at the very peak of her trajectory she lets go
the raptor sails through down from above feet first slamming both of them squarely into the raptors side sending it hurtling into space
she lands hard and awkwardly clanging into the spidery scaffolding next to malcolm as the raptor smashes to the ground below
but kelly manages to hold on
she grabs hold of malcolm and pulls him to his feet
kelly and malcolm appear over the roofline
the pilots shouts from inside
malcolm and kelly scramble toward the helicopter
but at the opposite side of the roof a raptor claws its way over the edge as well
malcolm sees it and they lunge for the helicopter but the animal is far faster
its only ten feet away then five theyre surely done for this time when there comes the loudest single gunshot anyone has ever heard and the raptor flies off its
feet and lands ten feet across the roof dead
they look up to the source of the gunshot
its roland standing at the edge of the roof holding his smoking
but theres no time for celebration as suddenly the helicopters left skid cracks right through the surface of the roof
the skid dips even further ripping right through the thatch and wood construction
kelly who had one foot in the helicopter loses her balance as the roof caves in beneath her
she falls screaming through the hole and down into the building below
kelly lands with a crunch on the floor immediately below the roof about nine feet down
but her landing is cushioned by an inordinate amount of straw and leaves that have been arranged there
she lifts one hand and a yellowy viscous substance drips off of it
she looks around noticing half a dozen large oblong shapes
above her malcolm is scrambling climbing down to her through the wreckage of the creaking crumbling roof
kelly climbs to her knees but behind her a large dark shape is moving
unfolding in a way
yep flying dinosaur
the enormous animal raises its head a brilliant blue crest extending two feet behind its long saber like beak
it squawks at kelly in fury
she can only stare spellbound
malcolm reaches her and grabs hold as the angry animal unfurls its massive twenty two foot wingspread
the helicopter lurches as it sinks further into the crumbling roof and now the skids are getting tangled in the debris
roland races over to the hole climbs in a few feet and starts kicking at it making it larger
give me a ladder
malcolm tries to haul kelly back up the way he came but a second pteranodon now appears from the depths of the building screeching in fury at these invaders who
have landed in the middle of their clutch of eggs
an emergency rescue ladder drops through the hole in the roof
malcolm grabs kelly with one arm and the ladder with the other and they start to climb out of the nest
malcolm and kelly climb the ladder and are pulled into the belly of the chopper just as two enormous beaks break through the surface of the roof around them
the pteranodons are emerging
the helicopter lurches up a few feet but it yanked to an abrupt stop
the engines whine the chopper just hovers there
were snagged on something
they loos down
both pteranodons have come out through the hole in the roof and are clinging to the skids of the helicopter
they flap their gigantic wings in unison and drag the helicopter off into the air away from the nest and let go
freed the helicopter gains altitude quickly
the pilots gape as the pteranodons coast along right next to the helicopter
if i tip it hard i can cut em with the rotors
theyre not attacking
they look out the windows where indeed the magnificent animals are merely accompanying them flying escort as the chopper gains altitude
sarah contd theyre protecting their nest
thats all theyre doing
kelly completely drained sits between sarah and malcolm each of whom has a protective arm around her
she sags against her fathers chest nothing left
he holds her tight and whispers in her ear
kelly thank god
thank god for you
over the island the helicopter steadily gains altitude
a hundred feet
as the helicopter is clearly leaving the island the pteranodons now peel off their job done
one of them banks sharply right in front of the moon
the moonlight silhouettes it shining right through its membranous wings lighting it up like a halloween skeleton
below the tiny green island melts away into the vastness of the wine dark sea
elsewhere in the forest its not such a happy story
peter ludlow still alive drops through the air and crunches to the muddy ground
dizzy bleeding the breath knocked out of him he opens his eyes and sees a sloping bank of dried mud
from behind him he hears a chirping sound
hes in the tyrannosaur nest
the baby tyrannosaur faces him still with a strange aluminum foil cast on its leg
the baby squeaks with excitement as it toddles toward him
ludlow scrambles to his feet unsure what to do
both adult tyrannosaurs stand outside the nest staring down at him
the baby runs toward ludlow so he turns and runs away
but in an instant the male brings its head down knocking ludlow to the ground
then it raises its head again
ludlow gets up again and tries to run but now the female rex strikes knocking him over again
ludlow tries to crawl away on all fours
the male bends down and closes its jaws around one of his legs holding it tightly
ludlow screams and the rex bits down decisively
the bone breaks with a dry snap
ludlow howls in pain unable to move and the baby toddles forward eagerly
ludlow can only stare as it leaps up onto his chest and opens its jaws wide
peter ludlow screams
snow falls in a gray midwinter sky
in a cemetery a group of fifty mourners is grouped around a gravesite next to a coffin that is festooned with cascades of flowers
on a table there is an array of framed photographs of john hammond
a minister reads from the bible while the mourners wipe away tears
ian malcolm stands a respectful distance from the group kelly right beside him
malcolms face is blank tired his sunburn out of place with the white winter setting around him
at gravesite a young woman turns looking back over her shoulder
about sixteen shes lovely with long blonde hair and an honest open face
she notices malcolm recognizes him
she nudges a young man next to her about thirteen years old
the young man turns and breaks into a smile just as welcoming
as the ceremony breaks up they walk over to him
lex stands on her tiptoes and kisses malcolm on the cheek
tim extends a hand and malcolm shakes it
malcolm contd this is kelly
they nod their hellos
im glad you came dr
malcolm im sorry about your grandfather
we were going to call you in a few days
tim and i have been thinking and weve decided we want people to know about the island
about what we all saw
we think its something our grandfather would want us to do
because its true
malcolm looks at her for a long moment
i know lex
but even if were the only ones who ever know itll still be true
you see ive decided that if the world found out about what your grandfather created it wouldnt be around for very long
but it was real
you cant let people go on saying its not
thats the thing about reality
he looks down at kelly
malcolm contd even when people stop believing in it it doesnt go away
kelly smiles and takes his hand her slender fingers interlocking with his
back on isla sorna we float over the deserted worker village moving lightly as in a dream
do you feel the cold wind blowing on your face
we sweep low landing on the roof the helicopter took off from the nest below now careful rebuilt with straw and scrap a dozen unblemished eggs in the middle of
do you see the four of us standing here together alive
a pteranodon land gently on the nest
ever so carefully it positions itself over the eggs lowers itself to roosting position and folds its giant wings around its body
and maybe thats still that matters
the animal raises its head opens its beak and squawks approvingly up at the heavens
