written by larry ferguson tom clancy beneath slate grey sky
frigid rock and stunted trees fall to an ice choked coast
congealed sea on a desolate beach
bare headed in cold wind studies the inclement coast
bottomless eyes move slowly across the landscape missing nothing
soviet submarine base on the barents sea mi north of murmansk ramius wears a tar black winter uniform of captain first rank in the soviet navy
behind him out of sight someone speaks cold this morning captain
when he replies he speaks not about the weather but of the land it is cold
turning his back on the icy coast ramius smi i fondly at the man who just spoke to him ramius executive officer also in black uniform
borodins rigged with a mike
buttons gambol in his nubian cap like money
e your head a bit
no need to crowd him
come left three degrees
make your course three four zero
sonar let me know when we pass fifty fathoms
a helmsman responds on a speaker in the sail
nautical cross talk
orders given and affirmed
pulling back ramius and borodin are revealed standing atop a huge submarine trading a gigantic rudder a hundred yards aft her sail
a patrol boat and icebreaker escort her to sea
on speakers in the sail captain political off er putin requests permission to come to the bridge
under his breath think of it comrade
son of only a humble mm worker
quiet as grass vastly
quiet as grass
louder turning good morning comrade political off er block faced forties pink necked political officer assigned to red october clambers through the hatch into the air wheezing ah captain every
time i climb that ladder i realize what an over fed ox rve become
put in smiles
ramius smiles back but his eyes are cold
suddenly theres not a lot of lave on the bridge such a glorious day
so exciting to h t ally put the land behind us and be on our way
bourgeois of me i know but my enthusiasm at being chosen polidcica
officer on this historic mission its me with pride
me a man of such humble birth whose father was only a mill
think of it comrades a mill worker
putin stares at him
borodin covers with a cough
putin keeps starring
flushed borodin looks away
putin turns porcine eyes on ramius your father was a lithuanian was he not captain
you know he was
i knew a lithuanian once
his words hang like rotten fru though im sure your father was nothing like him
pefmisrdon to go below
smirking putin leaves
ramius watches him go
speakers in the conn to bridge sonar reports we are crossing sixty fathoms
its time captain
st m dealing with putins exit ramius turns away from the hatch contemplating the shore
after a beat softly
into the headset clear the bridge
prepare to dive
captain coming below
of cer of the deck make signal to escort
red october prepares to dive
all that remains is icy
sea and the sand
then faintly at first from the frozen coast rises into the swirling sky
it seems to come from everywhere the rocks the trees the sea itself
red october dives
the screen fades to black and a giant title appears chorus booms
male voices ring in thundering tribute to the heart and soul of mother russia
credits keep rolling
then from of john paul jones fighting the serapis appears
its on the wall
in a cluttered study
books crowd every bit of space
photos models and nautical memorabilia everywhere
an english suburb in drizzling rain
red army chorus sings softly
in a driveway a late model rover waits lights on engine running
at a messy desk early thirties good looking disheveled and harried stuffs papers into a brief case
slamming it shut he reaches for his raincoat
appears in the doorway
her name is sally
shes ryans daughter
wearing a nightgown with butterflies on it shes carrying a well worn koala bear daddy
what are you doing up
youre suppose to be sleeping
kneeing beside her ryan talks in a steady unpatronizing way
he loves her to death whats the matter
where are you going
i have to go on a business trip and you have to go to sleep or when you grow up youll only be two inches tall
stanley keeps waking me up
stanley is sallys bear
ryan talks to it like it was alive
it makes sally grin
whats the matter stanley
are you nuts or something
hes not nuts
he needs a brother
if he had a brother then he could go to sleep better
before ryan can answer a ravishing woman in her
late twenties marches into the study
she is english intelligent features in tweed suit and raincoat
a matronly woman hovers in the doorway behind her we are never going to make it
just a minute
daddy has to go cricket
you and stanley go upstairs with mrs
wheeler and go straight to sleep
when im away ill see if i can find stanley a brother
pulling to a curb in driving rain at heathrow
red army chorus swells
leaping out ryan grabs luggage and races to the drivers side
margaret pulls his face through the window
im all wet
youre sexy when youre wet
im gonna miss you
get out of here yank
or ml tear you limb from limb
i got you these
theyil help you sleep on the plane
she has a bottle of pius in her hand
he squints at it shaking his head in the pouring rain wont do me any good jack
i ll try
taking the pil s he kisses her again
all of a sudden he wants to climb inside park someplace and steam the windows
her smile is you only have three minutes
if im lucky might miss the damn plane altogether
seated beneath the only light in a dark cabin
turbulence rattles a teacup
a stewardess appears smiling down at him can i get you anything sir
why dont you try to sleep
the l f ight will go much faster
i cant seem to sleep on planes
its the turbulence
when solar radiation heats the earths crust
warm air rises
cool air descends
i dont like it
are you a scientist
i just read a lot of books
well try and get some sleep anyway
wide awake ryan stares out the window at the spinning dark
red army chorus booms
humping his suitcase into a giant terminal at the end of a long line of travelers
above the line a sign moves down the line stopping beside ryan mr
exhausted ryan nods
sunglasses takes ryans bags
gliding to a stop at the security kiosk outside a suburban office compound
sign over the compounds entrance sixties a mane of white hair in three piece suit cia direcbor of naval intelligence looking up from behind a mahogany desk jack boy
get yourself in here
you look like hell
come on over here and sit down
you want coffee
i think i need ooffiae
ryan perches on the couch
greer pours ryan takes it in both hands coaling it with his breath
im not gonna ask you how your flight was
whens the last time you slept
this thing is still on london time
she sends you her best
what is she now three
a very precocious five
a week ago she announced her life would be a loot less lonely if margaret and i would buy her a baby brother
where you gonna do that
greer eyes him fondly
putting down his coffee ryan opens his br efse
all right whats important enough to get you on a
plane in the middle of the night
dropping onto the tihle in front of greer
they show the bow and stern of a submarine in dry dock
from the size of the construction crey its obvious the boat is huge
british intelligence received these two days ago
shes the red october
the soviets newest typhoon
the brits actually got a man into the construction shed
this pair was digitally enhanced for line resolution
this one for color
twelve meters longer than the normal typhoon three meters wider
the captains name is ramixts
one of yours
i did the bio on him last year
hes taken out the lead boat in each new sub class for ten years
fairly good political connections
hes also trained most of their attack boat skippers
they can him the vilnius schoolmaster
greer studies one of the photos with a magnifying glass
something captures his attention what are these doors
the doors admiral are the problem
i dont know what they are and neither do the english
its just pole our friends at the ustinov design bureau have come up with something new
with your permission id like to show these to someone
do you know skip tyler
did he get hurt or something
he was captain on an attack boat
got clipped by a drunk driver and lost a leg
now hes teaching at the academy and doing some consulting for underwater systems command
do you want to talk to him
right now if its ox with you
never met him personally but ill take care of it
margie have a car for dr
ryan at the front gate in tan
ryan retrieves his photographs
getting up greer watches him choosing his words carefully one of our satellites caught red october in polijarny inlet this morning
they shouldnt have been sea ready for weeks
ryan closes his case
greer walks him to the door relax son
the navys got a las angeles class sittjng right off their doorstep
in a few days well know everything about her but the woks name
well in that case can you tell me where i can buy a bear
same place you buy a baby brgther i guess
the groan of a primordial beast echoing in the dark followed by a deep vibration that rattles bones and shatters eardrums
the black screen is moving
a massive cylinder glides over the top of us like a giant spaceship outlined by flashes of e ectxic blue phosphorenscence
los angeles class attack sub mks west of polijarny inlet in the sonar shack a state of the art sonar display glows blue
high tech graphics pinpoint movements in deep water beyond the hull
listens to a headset and eyeballs the display
a college dropout with a genius iq jones is the kind of guy who likes tossing dead cats into crowded cathedrals
unruly red hair a minion freckles and a wary smile sits beside jones
on speakers in the bulkhead the primordial howl again muffled clued with noise transients no
its buried in
i should go to saps
correct seaman beaumont
surface affects processing
there is hope for your small brain yet
and like mozart at saltzburg you have labored to produce
a whale beaumont
a marine mammal that knows a fuck of a lot more about sonar than you do
appearing in the sonar shack door directly chief of the boat a barrel chested bear smiles at beaumont he gets to raggin you too bad kid you can always ask
him about pavarattt
jones sinks into his chair
sea story coming
from the look on jones face it promises to be a good one tell me chief
taking his time well jonesy here hes a music freak right
and he figures this sonar system is basically just a big old million ddllar stereo unit
so he gets this piece of pavarmt i it was paganini
its this piece of music he likes so much he wants to share it right
so he re wires the computer and figures how to put it in the water with a gigawatt of juice behind it
now the captain he dont much care
but about twenty one boats out of san diego including one way out at pearl starts hearing pavarotti doming out their ass
jonesy has turned the whole fucking pacific ocean into a stereo speaker
and all of a sudden we got an admiral in the middle of it and were writing reports out the yang yang
even jones sm ies
then a flashing light on the
sonar display catches his eye
he starts flipping switches
beaumont sobers up what should i be sti i got it
jones works in silence then punches the intervom conn sonar
what is it jonesy
distant contact submerged bearing zero nine seven
its a wild guess but id say we had a boomer headed out of the barn
forward of sonar sailers drive the ship beneath a maze of pipes and equipment
at the center of the conn surrounded by fire control quartermaster helm skipper of the daza early forties muscular body encased in a blue jumpsuit works the intercom on the
periscope plat arm start a plot jonesy
im be there in a second
leaving the deck mancuso glances at his executive offker thirties dark complected standing at fire control i be in sonar phil jones is already working on the plot
in font of him on the sonar display the flashing light is starting to move
mancuso sticks his head in
what do you have
in red octobers conn
much larger than the control center on the dallas
leaving the deck ramius heads aft glancing at borodin when you see putin tell him that when its convenient be in my stateroom
leaving the conn ramius enters moving past a radio compartment on his left ramius stops at a door c osing the door behind him ramius turns into the room
surprised he sees seated at a desk reading a bible
startled putin looks up what are you doing
its my responsibility to oversee the stability of the crew captain
you know that
and you accomplish this by searching through my papers and invading my privacy
there is no such thing as privacy in the soviet union comrade
its antithetical to the oal ective good
suppressing his anger ramius moves to a locker changing into dungarees
he can fiee
putins weasel eyes crawling up and down his back
holding the bible put in muses you
surprise me captain
a man in your position reading trash about the end of the world
i am coming soon
i will give to each according to his deeds
i am the beginning and the end
did you underline these passages
the book belonged to my wife
i keep it only for sentimental value
your wife was a beautiful woman
a tragedy her life was cut so short
i assure you comrade
theres nothing wrong with my mind
trying to joke given the amount of fire power on red october im sure the whole world will
breathe a cm eotive sigh of relief
how many more agents does the kgb have on my boat
captain this is not your boat
it belongs to the union of the soviet socialist republics
you would be well advised to remember that
anyway i am only a political odfioer
if the kgb has an agent on board i would be the last to know
i suggest we open our orders
as you wish
theres a safe on the wall
ramius spins the combination
inside another safe with four locks
both ramius and putin have keys
inside the second safe a large envelope
it has an ornate
scarlet seal marked top secret
ramius cracks the seeal removing four pages of operation orders
glancing at putin he reads we are to proceed to grid and rendezvous with the akula submarine konovalov
captain tupalevs boat
you know tupolav
i know that he is descended from a long line of aril rats and that he was a student of yours
it is rumored he has no love in his heart for you
why is that
ramius pours two cups of steaming tea from a silver pot on a serving tray offering it to putin
putin takes the cup
there is no room in tupolevs heart for anyone or anything except tupolev
having made contact we are ordered to run a series of drfl
tupolev w l hunt us while we test our ship
putting down his tea putin stands suddenly formal awkwardly captain this is an historic moment for all
i should like to make a request
before you do i want to talk to you about something important
i know that it is not aooording to protocxrl but would you permit me to post the orders and inform the crew of our mission
as you wash comrade
putin grins heading for the door
he never makes it
in a sudden violent motion ramius kicks putins left leg from under him
surprised the big man tumbles sideways
leaping to his feet ramius catches putin slamming him into a headlock driving his thick neck downward cracking his skull in the sharp corner of the desk
cupping his chin ramius forces his entire bulk onto the mans chest
his eyes bulge
ramius strains using all of his strength until
and his face goes slack
with surprising gentleness ramius lowers the shuddering body to the deck
carefully he checks the pulse in putins neck
dying putin stares into ramius face
i an sorry my friend
but it is cyear to me now
where i would walk you cannot fallow
whatever his destination putins on his way
getting up ramius goes to the desk
returning with the teapot he drenches the body with scalding tea
replacing the pot on the tray ramius puts the orders in a wastebasket and sets them on are
removing a duplicate set of orders from his safe he places them on the floor by the dead man
satisfied everything is the way he wants it he moves to an intercom and takes a deep breath
pushing a button he bellows dr
come to my quarters at once
theres been an aociderit
resembling an airstream t xxzller with a propeller on the back
its floating in a gargantuan tank fslled with brightly lit water beneath a vast domed cetling patuxent maryland built like a fireplug a monument to logic and impatience leans on
a cane atop a platform by the tank i watching thirties the bane of tylers existence
steiners head is sticking out of a hatch on the mini sub
eyeing him tyler bellows youre never gonna go anywhere be
unless you close the hatch and start the goddam engine
youre one of those guys you cant hide things from right
grits his teeth
steiner closes the hatch
across the room ryan enters
spotting tyler he moves to the platform staring at the mini sub
the propeller starts turning
re mini sub what it that thing
deep submergence rescue vehicle
thats what a dsrv looks like
i designed this one
lts aan d the mystic
what are you doing with it
tyler climbs off the piatfarm working his cane with practiced precision
taking ryan by the arm he heads for a door rigging it with a generic docking acllar so it will mate with british german other kinds of subs
this one here is designed to be super mobile
we can get it anywhere in the world in twenty four hours
if that lunatic doesnt crash it fast
admiral greer says you have some pdr ures
high tech naval architecture
technicians graduate students move about in the background
tyler is hunched over the red october bigger than a regular typhoon
what are these doors
you dont miss much do you
theyre too big for torpedo tubes
could you launch a missile horizontaly
question is why would you
besides theyre symmetrical right straight through the hull
how about a towed sonar array
barely clears the screw in the tyler freezes
somewhere in that vast abundance of grey matter a ia be go to hell
its a caterpillar
magneto hydrodynamic propulsion
like a linear induction motor with saltwater as the tat r
items like a jet engine for water
goes in the front gets squirted out the back
only its got no moving parts see
so its potentially very quiet
try silent if this works well have to find a whole new way to track submarines
ryan grapples with the implications
tyler trips down memory lane we messed with it
never could make it work
they really built this
this isnt a mock up or anything
it put to sea this morning
you know when i was eleven years old i helped my daddy build a bomb shelter in the basement because some fool parked a dozen warheads in cuba ninety miles
from the florida coast
this thing could park two hundred warheads off new york or washington and nobodyd suspect a thing til it was all over
any records of our work on the caterpillar
we got an archive
lets get dusty
two russian sailors lug his zip locked corpse into a walk in freezer in red octobers galley
three ks assistants carve steaks and watch
one of them tweet ts muscular in striped sail or shirt and bell bottom pang tosses a hunk of f into a pail
s right rami a and borodin talk with forties
thin bespectacled and careworn
a dedicated party man and compulsive gossip petrov is the red octobers medical ofdoer
ramius has the counterfeit orders in his hand if i hadnt spilled the tea putin might never have slipped and you must not blame yourself captain
i assume we wall be returning to base
we will not
but how can we continue a m scion without a political offcer
for many years the russian navy went to sea before there were political offscers doctor
yes but these orders are quite specific
putins unfortunate death wall not change them
turning ramius spots loginov and waves his hand
cooks assistant loginov sir
now i want you and the doctor to witness this ioginov
i have removed putins missfle key from his neck and am keeping it myse f
closing the freezer door the sates save
loginov isnt sure what to do
petrovs agitated this is all very unnerving captain
the reason for having two missm keys in the first place is to prevent one person from
from what doctor
making a mistake and
we must report this to red meet command
we are ordered to maintain strict radio silence
that will be all comrade
glad to be anywhere else loginov returns to his work
captain perhaps i should keep putins key until i suggest you return to sick bay doctor
soon i will address the crew and explain our orders
this is not a decision for discussion
shrugging petrov disappears
borodin and ramius
freaked loginov watches them go
bent over jones shoulder in the da as sonar shack concentrating on the blinking light on the sonar display
thompsons to his left
jones is on a headset hes holding steady on zero two zero twelve knots at about ten thousand yards
can you identify him
computers chewing on it
twin screw and the plant noise sounds like a typhoon but computer ptintar clatters
ripping off the printout mancuso must be a new boat
i miss something in dispatch the last few days phil
fleet hasnt said a word about it
start a f e on his jonesy
for now call his sierra thirty five
leaving r see if we can work in a little closer and sniff his out
thompson fcdows mancuso
beaumont glances at jones whispering wont the soviets hear us
not if we stay in his baffles seaman beaumont
not if we stay in his baffles
come in behind his propeller and hes deaf as a post
in red octobers conn
at all stations helm fire control quartermaster sailors work with galvanic prec s r n
standing next red octobers navigator watches ramius i tently
the tension is palpable
something extraordinary is about to happen down scope
sonar is clear captain
rm going to address the crew
ramius grabs the whip telephone
jaw set his eyes blaze with comrades here are our orders given to us by red fleet command
it is our good fortune to make the first test of our revolutionary propulsion system
in various locations all over the ship sailors stop what they are doing and listen carefully crowded together at tables men hear ramius voice we are to pass quiet as
water through every one of the americans sonar nets
maintaining strict radio
silence we are to proceed across the atlantic to the east coast of the united states
beneath a maze of pipes technicians listen once in the home waters of the enemy we are to conduct a series of ine firing tests targeting major cities on the
enemys eastern seaboard
men are spellbound by their captains intensity for many years we have had to stand helplessly in the wings while poll ns compromise every advance our military has made
ramius stands on the periscope platform holding the phone
all eyes are riveted on him it is politicians who have crippled our armed forces while talking incessantly of peace
and now it is time comrades to exchange the cuckoo for a hawk
our missies will not be armed of course but imagine if they were
in one bright moment all that we believe in all that we honor would prevail forever
ramius is finished
no one moves
kamarov has goose bumps
rig for silent running
reduce engines to quarter speed and open outer doors
a sail cr locks a program into a computer
in the water the mysterious doors on the subs bow begin to open
behind them a strange tunnel is revealed
ramius and his men hear the dark ring of steel on steel in deep outer doors are open captain
engage the caterpi lar
in the water
an eerie green ring of light starts to glow in the tunnel behind thedoors
a second light appears
then a third flashing florescent
behind the tunnel in the stern red octobers giant propeller comes to a stop
suddenly more light appears distorted by a sudden rush of water
in the dalla sonar shack working his computer
the cob is behind him beaumont to his left
red octobers ampisfied hiss f ms the room
suddenly jones frowns
the blinking light on his sonar display disappears
curious the cob leans over jones studying the screen what happened
what do you mean dont know
on the deck by the phone in red octobers conn
conscious of all eyes on him he turns to a helmsman left full rudder
rudder is left fub
navigator make your new course two five zero
coming to course two five zero
kama ov draws a line on his chart
the new course is west into the atlantic
suddenly the intercom crackles sonar contact captains dead astern
an american los angeles ass he must have been in our baffles
we cant have raising his hand ramius activates the intercom sonar
is the american turning to ballow us
no hes not
hes continuing on our original course
he cant hear us
silence impulsively kamarov starts humming the internationale
of cers and enlisted men join in
one at a time the crew raise their voices in the torpedo room engineering wardroom and the conn the anthem grows louder and louder
caught in the moment ramius joins the chorus
sticking his head into sonar
the cob and beaumont are on pins and needles
jones is working his computer furiously
it did what
it disappeared sir
t a d what are you talking about
check your gear
running diagnostics now captain
jones is starting to sweat
he runs his tests
urning he stares blankly at mancuso sonar is working sir
the russian just disappeared
one minute he was steady four thousand yards off our bow and then he was gone
and r a second i thought i heard
well i thought i heard singing sir
hairs stand up on the back of mancusos neck dead in the water at four hundred feet
size of the dallas this ones bualt for speed and maneuverability
they dont come any better
aku a cass soviet submarine grid square a crew works in the conn reading computer displays checking writing emendations on status boards
on the ate thirties intense leans over a navigator tab e
a blond man with a clipboard approaches
he is early thfrties tupolevs executive officer
this conn is smaller than red
octobers and the weird vibes perfectly reflect the rampant paranoia of the commander captain tupolev
what is it l st m no sign of red october sir
i think we should surface and contact red fleet command
to what purpose
to inform them red october has not appeared
what makes you think she hasnt
tupolev glides to a quartermasters station
following him bonavias stomach growls
has it occurred to you that red october may already be in position
that ramius is merely hiding behind his silent drive
waiting for me to break radio silence and make a fool of myself
i will not break radio silence
we wilt lie here quietly for a few more hours
if ramius hasnt arrived by then ill contact red fleet command
captain i am concerned that i care little for your concerns comrade
bonavia glances at the quartermaster
his stomach growls again
moving through the security gates fronting a monstrous stalinist office building snow cracks beneath cold tires
soviet navy pniitical dir ctorafie from his post in the portico a uniformed guard races to the limo and opens the door for a dyspeptic grumpy old man
he is in an overcoat and a rumpled hat brim turned up in front
climbing stairs padorin returns rigid salutes with a sour yeah right leave me alone wave entering padorin mounts a giant staircase
naval officers snap salutes
padorin answers dourly
yeah heave me alone
mumbling he moves through leaving a wake of aides and sues crawling all over themselves whispered greetings on their lips
yeah right leave me alone
frowning and cranky padorin marches into where hes met by his seventy four year old personal orderly
theyve known each other forever and act like an old married couple
the orderly takes padorins overcoat and hat
behind a desk padorin lights a morning cigarette
the orderly brings tea things and incessant small talk
padorin says nothing
finally padodn sits focusing on the morning mail twenty or so letters are laid neatly on a blotter
yeah right leave me alone
yeah leave me alone
dont heel like dealing with mailaz now
theres a note from marko ramivs there
the old coot almost smiles
this heil read
getting the envelope open he prepares for a good time
somewhere in the first paragraph
his smile fades
the hand holding his cigarette begins to shake
reaching absently for
the teacup nearing the bottom of the pager padoadn chokes spilling everything
mancuso at the door
beaumont is at his station next to jones
wearing a headset jones concentrates on his sonar display
suddenly he rips the headset off jesus christ
somebody just stepped on the gas
sonar contact captain
viktar class soviet submarine
cutting big holes in the water
bearing six five zero
put it on the speakers
whining propellers and cavitation noise fi the sonar shack
suddenly more propellers jeez
theres another one
bearing even three
theres two more out there
theyre all in a hurry and dont care who the hell knows it
have the soviets scheduled submarine races today sir
im gonna radio fleet command
he takes off
jones hears something buried in the propellers and cavitation noise
a strange whooshing sound
frowning he starts a tape rewarder
ryan picks it up
he and tyler are hip deep in top secret fees in the naval archive stacks
no this is dr
he stares at tyler quizzically waiting jack
yes admiral im where the hell are you
get your ass to the south entrance of the executive offtce buflding in forty five minutes
its across from the white house
got t yes sir but whats in his oface on the phone to ryan lets just say this is no longer a research project
in the background as ryan springs from his car racing up the steps to the executive office building
at the top of the stairs waiting for him greer is already in motion come on
ryan follows him past a security guard and into decorated with secretaries and suits all in quiet motion
at speed ryan trues to keep up with greer i got a line on the doors
you know what they are
greer doesnt answer
impatient ryan follows him into greer pushes a button marked sub level four
turning to ryan a silent propulsion system
captain of the sub we had following her radioed in
thing up and disappeared right in front of him
but that isnt the half of it
he hands ryan a sheaf of message flimsies
the descending elevator stops
realizing hes been left behind ryan takes off entering reading and walking ryan does his best to keep up with greer jesus
this is unbelievable
the kirov too
theyve sortled their whale bloody fleet
about the size of it
glancing up from his reading ryan notices a sign at the end of the stopping on a dime his eyes narrow wherere we going anyway
brle ng jeffrey pelt
presidents national security advisor
most of the joint chiefs will be there
along with a few other people
whos giving the brieefing
the yeomanfl have the slides all laid out
ail you have to do ten feet ahead greer realizes ryans no longer fauowing
stopping he comes back look
no one knows this material better than you do
give him a rundown on the sub and a precis of the stuff in your hand
hes liable to ask some direct questions
give him direct answers and say what you think
yowll do fine
ryan takes a deep breath
into the white house briefing room
joint chiefs are gathered around a thirty foot conference table
greer introduces ryan to a general and an admiral then mingles
left alone ryan spot a lectern at the foot of the tabl
nearby a yeoman tends a slide machine an overhead projector and a large bulletin board
ryan heads for the lectern
the yeoman has a list of slides some photos and mustrations
trying to gather his thoughts ryan steps behind the lectern
the presidents national security advisor arrives
in his mid mss wearing wire rim spectacles pelts nearsighted broliant and a crackerjack poker player
generals and admirals take their places
pelt site at the head of the tabl turning to greer lets get started
the preliminary briefing today w m be handled by dr
i believe youve seen some of his work
you may begin
taking a sip of water ryan nods at the yeoman
projector is gentlemen the last twenty four hours have seen some extraordinary soviet naval activity
the first to sail was this ship the red october
a variant of the typhoon class shes some six hundred fifty feet long
thirty two thousand tons submerged displacement roughly the size of a world war ii aircraft carrier
unlike the standard typhoon equipped to fire long range missiles from russian waters red october carries fifty six ss s which is a short range attack mis it with eight
thats four hundred forty eight warheads all spedfically designed to fire close in
we believe these doors on the bow and here again on the stern enclose a magneto hydrodynamic drive or caterpillar which may allow the sub to run totally silent
it is possible this new drive system allowed the captain a man named marko ryan points out two photos on a bulletin board
one is of ramius alone
the other is a wedding photo of ramius and a beautiful woman
to elude one of our attack boats the dallas which trailed red october f r om harbor this morning
this drive if its working could render red october invvsihl to our sosus warning nets in the atlantic
you would characterize this as a first strike weapon dr
ryan glances at greer
greer smi reassuringly
theres no doubt about that sir
she is designed to approach by stealth and fire on a target with little or no warning
an offensive weapon
the kind you start wars with
if i may continue
shortly after the dallas lost contact there were additional soviet mailings from pa tjarny leningrad and the mediterranean
the soviets have fifty eight nuclei submarines headed at high speed into the atlantic
and this afternoons satellite pass over policjarny found head blooms in the engineering plants of the kirov the minsk and more than twenty cruisers and destroyers indicating that the bulk
of their surface fleet is also preparing to sail
flushed ryan sits beside greer
pelt turns to greer conclusions
absence of activity in the pacific suggest this is probably just an exercise having nothing to do with the red october
a general starts to object
hes cut off by judge moore a white haired civilian near the top of the table nsa can speak to that mr
i must emphasize the extremi sensitivity of this information and ask that on no aooount it leave this room
before sailing captain ramius sent a letter to admiral yuri padorin chairman of soviet naval deployment
painting at ramius wedding picture ryan whispers to greer thats her uncle
padorins her uncle
greer has no idea what ryans saying
moores still talking the contents of the letter are unknown but admiral padorin immediately demanded a meeting with premier ligachev and within minutes of that meeting the soviet fleet sailed
with orders to find red october and sink her
audible intake of breath round the room
pelt is the first to sink her
theyve got a madman on their hands
hes gonna start a war
a spirited discussion ensues
tuning it out ryan stares at the picture of ramius and his wife
urgently he whispers to greer this is the twenty gird isnt it
order in the room has broken down
generals and admirals argue vehemently about appropriate
staring at the photos a light goes off in ryans brain sljencel
ryan realizes everyone in the room is staring at him
youve something to add to the discussion dr
i was just thinking there was perhaps another possibility we ought to consider
ryan takes a deep breath
ramius might be trying to defect
ryan glances at greer
greer rolls his eyes
too far out
ryans on his own
general bristles do you mean to suggest go ahead dr
well ramius trained most of their officer corps
hed be in a position to sect men willing to help him
and hes not russian
hes lithuanian by birth and by heritage
he was raised by his maternal grandfather who was a fisherman
he has no children no ties to leave behind and this morning was the first anniversary of his wifes death
oh come on
look what are you doing here anyway ryan thats his name isnt ryan
youre just an analyst right
you cant possi hly know i know ramins general
been a maverick for his entire career
i even met him once at an embassy dinner
i met captain ramius sir
have you ever the general darkens
making a decision pelt turns to the admiral bottom line how long before rami us will be in a position to launch his misses at us
ill brief the president
that will be all gentlemen
would you stay for a moment please
everyone gets up to leave
as greer rises he winks at ryan i said speak your mind jack but shaking his head greer pats ryans shoulder and leaves
ryans mouth is dry
pelt gets up you slammed the door on the general pretty hard jack
it wasnt my intention sir yes it was
he was patronizing you and you stomped on him
in my opinion he deserved it
look im a politk ian jack
that means im a liar a cheat and when im nvt kissing babies im stealing their lallipops
but it also means i know people and keep my options open
lets assume for a minute that youre right and he intends to defect what do you think we should do
well somebody has to go out and try to contact him
when can you leave
wait a minute
the general was right
im just an analyst perfect
i cant ask any of these chai tacters to go
none of them would volunteer putting their reputations on the line
and anyway none of them are expendable
give you three days to prove your theory after that we wont have any choice but to hunt ramius down and blow him away
will you do it
ryan stares at pelt
below haze grey sky
a ape breaks the surface trailing a small wake
submarine is below
tupolav spins the
periscope in the konova ovs conn
bonavia brings him a message
frowning tupolev reads it
mother of god
dive the ship
saes in the conn prepare to dive
tupalev is furious
turning to bonavia he sneers the entire soviet fleet has been ordered to hunt ramius down and destroy him
and where were we
out of contact
dead in the water
have you forgotten that it was you who i have forgotten nothing
all ahead flank
come to course three five zero
at the head of a table in red octobers wardroom borodin to his left
seven officers sit or stand to the side
beside borodin forties grey eyes red octobers engineer
at the door nervous twenties asiatic locks a dead bait securing the wardroom
tension is elect ic palpable
thirties curly brown hair red octobers sonar offer stares at ramius anxious to get something off his chest before we begin captain
i would like to know exactly what happened to putin
he didnt slip on his tea
visibly shaken stadnyuk waves his hands captain
there is no way we could have accomplished our task with putin aboard
he would have stopped us
i have no objections to eliminating him
he was a pig
but its a decision we should all have made
youre not in command
dont give me that command garbage vasily
this is no ordinary cruise
were all risking our lives
everything that happens affects each of us
putin is dead
the responsibility and the guilt are mine
theres something else you should know
on the morning we sailed i posted a letter to admiral padorin announcing our intentions to defect
borodins jaw drops
kamarov whispers in the name of god why
we needed to burn the bridges
make a clean break
theyll find us
theyll hunt us down
keep your voice down ivan
nobody can find us
you had to do it didnt you
you couldnt just fallow the plan and turn the submarine over to the americans
you had to rub moscows nose in it and make some kind of hare brained political statement
you signed our death warrants
how many times have you served in my command viktrxr
many times do you know me to be a man who talerates insubordination
tbili blanches but will not look away
ramius glances at the return to your posts
all of you
no one moves
time crawls by
finally borodin gets to his feet you heard the captain
one by one the men file out of the wardroom
when they are gone borodin turns to ramius
speaking quietly captain
i would never disagree with you in front of the men
but viktor is right
we are in this together
what we are attempting is df cult
and our original orders were to demonstrate that this ship cannot be found
that is precisely what we will do
working his tape recorder in the dallas sonar shack
varying speeds aftering extraneous noise jones is isolating the eer e in a raging storm
an c a greyhound appears turboprops screaming buffeted like a ping gong ball on a howling canvas of ryan rides out the storm
hes wearing the uniform of a naval commander
lightning irradiates windows
sits directly behind ryan at a small desk built into the bulkhead
behind the navigator in a cockpit pilot and copilot
eyeing ryan the navigator shouts some turbulence
you dont enjoy flying
ryan shakeshis head
gleefully the navigator bellows this is a picnic commander
you shouldve been with me six months ago when we hit a typhoon in the sea of japan
guys were puking all
over the place
the plot puked all over his window
i puked the radio to death
puke was everywhere and im not talking lightweight stuff
im talking industrial strength puke
next time you get a bright idea jack try putting a it in a memo
anyway when we hit that typhoon everybody knew what everybody else had for breakfast
puke was on the ceiling
puke was in the ais s ryan is green
in the storm bobbing like a cork in twenty foot waves thirty foot landing i strip
surging violently in all directions
the north atlantic miles south of greenland on the deck a landing signal officer screams into a
rain pounds his face
wiping his eyes he heading for the carrier
propellers shriek over the storm
lso bellows instructions into his walkie talkie
at the last moment wheels rip into the deck
a hook on the greyhounds belly catches the last wire
sparks cascade on wet steel
moving across the deck with an ensign fiort ies in a leather flight jacket approaches the greyhound
shouting sailors batten down the plane
a door opens
ryan climbs down a ramp on shaky legs
taking his arm davenport shouts charles davenport commanding officer of the kennedy
the admiral is waiting for you in his quarters
pouring coffee into a large mug on a tray loaded down with sandwiches
setting down the coffee the steward leaves
fifties a man of puritanical integrity takes a hit of the ooze in his quarters on the kennedy
knock on the door
ryan and davenport enter
sha dng hands jack ryan admiral
sorry for the confusion but as l was just
telling captain davenport im not a naval of cer i work for admiral greer at the
he thought i would draw less attention if i
was in uniform
you want coffee
something to eat
what can i do
for you son
you gonna tell me what all this activity is about
ryan hands painter a lettew
opening it painter studies the contents
davenport leans on a bulkhead staring at ryan
painter returns the letter cant get any higher authority than that
now whats going on
at a translucent status board in the quartermasters station on the dalla
behind the status board projected on a screen a nautical map of the north atlantic
mancuso and thompson enter
i know youre busy captain
but i may have something here
ive been working on a sound i heard when the typhoon disappeared
i washed it through the tape machine several times and managed to isolate it
but when i asked the computer to identify it the answer i got
was magma displacement
see the system we are using was originally designed to look four seismic events and although we adapted it
to hunt for submarines utto the chase jonesy
aye aye sir
anyway i got curious and
the sound on our lateral array
i located it four different times
the fifth time it was gone and i couldnt find it
but i want to show you what i worked up
picking up a grease pencil jones makes calculations on the status board overlaying the nautical map the first contact was at zero nine been hours and the bearing was two
then at zero nine thirty hours it was bearing two six zero
and at zero nine forty eight is was two ive zero
i came back to it at about ten hundred and the bearing was two four two
the last signal was real faint and i didnt have a very good lock on it
well i figure it couldnt be very far away from us right
lets say it was halfway between us and iceland
that would put it on a course like this
jones makes more calculations on the
mancuso recognizes a pattern headed directly into red route one
sir i believe the sound i heard is the acoustical signature of some kind of super quiet russian submarine and hes taking the inshore track off the iceland coast
what do you think captain
mancuso stares at the status board then turns to jones let me see if i got this straight
the three minion dollar computer tells you youre chasing after an earthquake and you arent convinced
so you get curious and came up with this theory on your own
you sold me
let me ask you this
if we get close to this supers lent sub again you think you can track him down
now that i know what to listen for i bag the sucker cold
frowning at ryan who sits opposite him finishing a sandwich christ ive heard some strange stuff ryan but that takes it
ramius must have a hundred men on that boat
they cant all want to defect
hed have a mutiny on his hands
not ne s y
if he personally recruita d the of cers its theoret i ally theoretically anythings p a but youre not in some cubicle at cia
over by the porthole painter clears his throat for the sake of argument lets assume youre right and ramius intends to defect
what are you gonna do with the boat
you cant keep it
the russians will
want it back
and theyrl know youve got it because the crew wl l tell them so
or do you intend to keep them too
perhaps it would be enough to get some i men aboard to analyze the propulsion a coast guard inspection
im not sure that well i agree with chuck on one thing son
youve got your neck stretched way out there
didnt greer ever teach you the rules of survival in a bureaucracy
ryan smiles weakly still it would be nice to keep it
whens the last time you slept
every time i get
the chance somebody puts me on another airplane
why dont you rack out fear a while
the chief outside will find you quarters
well be in cic in the morning
its gonna get real interesting out here the next couple of days
when you shook hands with him you notice the ring on his finger chuck
class of m
greer told me about him
three weeks after he was commissioned he was in a chopper on a rescue mission in the med
they went down
p and crew killed instantly
that kid spent eight months in traction with a broken
back and two years learning to walk again
i think lt s o k for him to wear
beat dont you
closing the door to a stateroom
exhausted he tumbles face down on a lower bunk head on a pillow
a sliver of light from the door to a head hits his face gotta be pie
anythings possible under the guise of coast guard
better to keep it
how do you keep ft

it could be a problem with the liquid helium cycle

how do you get the crew off a nuclear submarine

transient ocean noise on speakers
over the intercom sonar conn
anything yet tonesy
where is your phantom russian sub jonesy
according to your calcuiataons we should have picked him up hours ago
i can feel it
close dont count in anything but horseshoes and hand grenades
jones glances at him dont encourage the man seaman beaumont
hes very old
the hell you say
youre an old man cob
way over the ham
your trout is so wrinkled its about to fau off
speaking of which what happened to that hustler magazine that was in the head
dont start on that crap
the c o and jones are everything he hoped the navy would be what hustler magazine
for many months seaman beaumont there was a hustler magazine located in the crews head
it was community property
then one day it disappeared
here was the last person seen entering the head before it vanished
whered it go
come on jonesy
i have a theory seaman beaumont
i believe the co b is like a black widow spider
after he has sex with a magazine he eats it
the cob turns pink
goddam you jonesy wait
jones the tunes a dial

like the dead
re status board our friends have been busy
during the night they positioned most of their front line submarines at barrier stations between greenland and iceland
here here and here
the majority of their northern fleet surface vessels are moving in a line abreast through here
its an old anti submaxlne tactic
like beaters in the jungle making a lot of noise driving the prey into the guns of waiting hunters
one of our submarines the da as reports intermittent contact with red october and is positioned here at the bottom of red route one
with luck the dallas will inte pt her
could you get me aboard the dallas
we could fly you out there in a helicopter
but i dont think youd like that much
no other way
thats all there is im afraid
putting down his coffee cup ryan stares at the status board
a sal ci r arrives with a message
reading it painter glances at ryan dailas found red october and is backing her now
locking eyes with painter ryan grits his teeth
from now on nothing but memos

rig for quiet running
all compartments eliminate noise evolutions
the cob and jones ft eeze
everythings super quiet
s going on jonesy
the soviet captain has a blind spot astern in his baffles and hes turning suddenly to see if he can catch us there
its a trick the soviets use called a crazy ivan turn
your average skipper might get caught with his pants down
we stop all engines and turn with him
staying in his baffles
quiet as a mouse
working his equipment jones whispers into his mike conn sonar
red october is coming left
my read is hes returning to base course
skipper got him
the russian hasnt got a clue
on the deck mancuso glances at fire control
bearing rate has steadied
hes returning to course two one zero
secure from quiet running
just decrypted this message from fleet command sir
opening the message mancuso scans it damn
re not gonna believe this
on a sh on the kennedys flight deck
ryan and davenport move to the waiting chopper
davenport shouts the dallas picked up red october and is tracking her again
the admiral issued orders for her to fall back and pick you up
davenport takes ryans arm
ryan listen to me
getting someone on a sub is a nightmare
the admiral told me what happened to you in the mediterranean
the next hour could be very rough
ryan ftroes a grin
a sax or helps him into the helicopter
davenport steps back
in his chair in his office in the executive office building
sitting on the couch in precisely the same position as when they last talked ambassador lysenko wipes his brow the weather in washington is so unpredictable dont you think
how can i help you ambassador
im afraid theres been a pew development
apparently the initial reports that one of our submarines was missing were not completely accurate
submarine in question red october is commanded by a captain marko ramius apparently r he has suffered some kind of a nervous breakdown
he posted a letter just before he announcing his intentions to fire his mis it at the united stat s
pelt stares at lysenko
lysenko shifts his weight
the russian finds pelts steadya
gaze unnerving why didnt you tell me this the last time we met
in my position im sometimes compromised by the fact that moscow doesnt tea me everything
so one of your submarine captains has gone insane
what is it you want from us
the other day you offered your assistance the other day it was a rescue mission
you want us to help you hunt ramius down and kill
because american lives are at stake ive been instructed to ask your president for precisely that
since you were so adamant about the consequences of confusion i thought we might ask him together
pelt picks up the phone
dappling a choppy sea
ice cold wind whips whitecapped waves and lashes the horizon
the helicopter with ryan aboard circles into view
pilot and copilot navigate tricky winds
two sailors crouch by an open door checking a harness on ryan
tuiindng to the pi ot the copilot bellows no contact with the daha
fuel capacity is in the red
we cant wait any unger
i have contact
tell them to surface
hook him up
but hurry we dont have much fuel left
sai or threads cable through a winch by the door
ryans white as a ghost
noise is deafening
another sai ar belts a harness to ryans back
ryan peers down
wind from the rotors crushes the waves
between his feet ryan can see the small white wake from a periscope
in the conn mancuso spins the scope
thompson watches him
both he and mancuso wear life jackets whoever this guy is hes in far one hell of a ride
officer of the deck
surface the ship
a flurry of activity in the conn
the dallas prepares to surface
mancuso and thompson move to a hatch by the helm
the saftors i nish strapping ryan into the sling
one of them leans forward painting to a ever on ryans chest shouting pull this to release
panic ryan glances down
a mitlion miles below the sea bans mine grey
sail in the conn work like lightning in cramped quarters
a petty afalcer straps mancuso and thompson into harnesses
you got a man dangling at the end of a line with no paint of reference and helicopter rotors generating enough static electak ty that we have to ground him
l be like grabbing a hot wire and if he falls in the water the only way to get him out is with divers cause most of the ships underwater
why i joined the navy
a sager hands mancuso a phone for the bridge
i put jonesy in the forward escape hatch in case he goes in the drink
we got no idea who this guy is or why the navy wants his on our boat so bad
teeth chattering sta ugg g with deja vu ryan is transfixed by the sub zero ocean
howling wind and crashing rotors
eyes wide he watches first the sail then the foredeck explode high into the air finally crashing back to the water
the cob helps jones climb into an escape trunk aft of the sail
its cramped and brightly lit
jones checks his equipment
ryan watches mancuso and thompson climb out of the sail onto the lurching bridge
the sailer leans close hollering hang on
he trips a laver on the winch
cable feeds out a few feet holding his breath ryan inches into the abyss
mancuso lays binoculars on ryan
thompson ties both of them to the sail the sub pitches and rolls
forward and aft are buried beneath waves
fingers freezing thompson clamps one end of a jumper cable to a metal lip on the bridge to ground the sub against static generated by the helicopters rut savage winds
from the choppers rotors start spinning ryan like a top
desperately he trams to control the dizzying motion
above caught in an unexpected wind sheer the chopper plummets seaward
ryans line goes slack
angry sea rushes up at him with blistering speed
the pilot struggles for control
behind him loose equipment slams into the winch jamming the cable
cursing the pilot regains control
the chopper stabilizes
cracking like a whip the cable goes taut
ryan feels like hes been hit with a sledgehammer
unable to breathe he rips off his helmet
a rock in a sling he tries to get his bearings
above the choppers rotors chew the sky
help s ryan starts swinging like a pendulum
mancuso and thompson watch ryan rocket by at mach
a huge arc carries him way out over the angry sea
slowing down ryan starts to spin again
see if you can get a ground on his line
im gonna try and catch the bastard
way out on the horizon ryan reaches the end of his arc and starts a comet like ride back at the ship
the pilot feathers
controls trying to reduce ryans mind boggling ride
over his shoulder he bellows reel him back in
the cables jammed
if they dont pick him up this time we have to cut him ioxe
the sailor keeps trying to rewind the cable
sweating he wraps gloved fingers around the emergency release on the drum
ryan watches the dallas saw rush at him with unbelievable speed a towering black monolith on an ubiquitous canvas of grey
thompson readies the ground holding one end in the air
a wave blasts the dallas
rips free of the bridge
surprised thompson goes overboard
caught in his harness he dangles helplessly above the water
mancuso and ryan reach for each other as ryan hurtles at the bridge
all hell breaks loose arcs between their oohed hands
blitzed mancuso is knocked hard to his knees
the sailor pulls
the release lever cutting the cable
it slams back inside like a two ton rubber band
unhooked ryan sling shots fifty yards over the pitching bow of the dalyas disappearing beneath the ice cold water
bubbles trailing from his mouth ryan struggles to free himself from the harness
a vision of hell hair blowing in all diyectlons mancuso eyeballs the spot where ryan went down screaming man overboard
thompson drags himself back onto the bridge
jones hears mancusos voice booming over speakers man overboard
twenty yards off the starboard bow
the cob slams the hatch turning the trunk into an iron tomb
jones pulls a mask over his eyes activates his oxygen and drags open the exterior hatch
in submerging him in icy stillness
securing a line to the bulkhead jones swims out into the swirling brine
the chopper banks hard to the left climbs into the mist and starts circling the dams
free of the harness ryan bobs like a cork in the waves
fifty yards away the keeness sub p bahes violently
surfaces next to ryan
removing his mouthpiece jones bellows over the crashing sea are
im gonna take you in through an escape trunk
jones hooks ryan to the line
salt stings ryans eyes
his breathings ragged
bedlam in the conn
mancuso helps thompson through the hatch
hell on wheels mancuso disappears down a passageway
jones and ryan ride waves by the curved hull
of the ship
jones offers ryan his mouthpiece
wait a minute
listen you son af a bit h
im only gonna tell you once
stick this fucking thing in your mouth and breathe
ryan takes the mouthpiece inhaling and exhaling rapidly
the helicopter circles above
jones drags ryan into bruised silence
pulling themselves downward along the dalla rolling hull ryan and jones share oxygen
ryan and jones pull themselves inside
blazing light ignites a fire storm of one caned organisms
eyes wide ryan watches jones c se the hatch
jones starts draining the trunk
everything slows down
the water level in the trunk drops and the assaults ryans eardrums
hurling the mouthpiece
away he gulps air in the rapidly draining trunk like a banked trout
outside the trunk mancuso and crew open the hatch
tumbling out ryan stands on shaky legs excited babbling jesus christ
i cant believe it
jesus christ a take it easy when i hit the water it was like ice
i thought i was going to freeze slow down
youre hypervent it sting
now who are you
im jack ryan
are you captain mancuso
the radioman appears with another message
mancuso rips it open and starts reading it
ryan rockets into captain we have to find the red october
shes a russian i already found him ryan
then i was ordered to pick you up
we have to find him again
the captain is going to defect and what the hell are you yammering about
i have to talk to mr
get this man some dry clothes and coffee
iil be in the conn
at the entrance of the sonar shack fifteen minutes later
behind him in the conn the crew is preparing to man battle stations
jones has returned to sonar
any sign that hes alerted to our presence
no sir captain
operating as before
ryan appears in dry clothes
mancuso ignores him
the of cer of the deck turns to mancuso captain
battle stations are manned
what do you mean battle stations
look ive been authorized by the president of the united states to talk to the captain of red october
mancuso takes the last message from his pocket and i have been ordered to blow him out of the water if he stays on a course to the united states
or demonstrates any hostile intentions
i dont understand
according to this hes gone bughouse and intends to fire his missiles
so much f your defection theory
mancuso hands ryan the message
ryan stares at
mancuso turns back to the officer of the deck officer of the deck
think about this a second
naturally the soviets would tall us he is insane
they want us to sink him before he has an opportunity to defect
captain crazy ivan
stop i come left and stay in his baffles
rig for quiet running
the officer of the deck repeats mancusos orders
mancuso and ryan are eyeball etc eyeball
ryan whispers listen to me captain
there must be some way you can establish contact without violating your orders
im telling you he wants to defect
if theres ever going to be peace in the world somebody has to take a risk
give the man a chance
i know it
after a beat ail back two thirds
jones glances at mancuso
mancuso stares at ryan the ofst r of the decks e d sorry sir
would you repeat i said aill back two thirds
ail back two thirds
ryans ears pop
jones glares at ail shop
we just unzipped our fly
now if he so much as twitches i m
gonna blow the bastard to mars
in the conn on red october surrounded by activity
urgently he speaks into a mike sonar this is ramius
can you identify the contact
american los angeles class attack submarine
bearing zero ftve zero range three hundred yards
in the dalla conn on the deck
thompsons at fire control
ryan is to mancusos left
crews at battle stations
flood tubes one and two and make torpedos ready in all
my orders are specific mister
tubes one and two flooded and ready in all respects
as before in red
the crew has come to battle stations
borodin is at fire control
the american has flooded his tubes and is preparing to orel prepare tubes three and four and plot a solution
shall i flood the tubes
captain shall i flood the tubes
after a beat no
lock the ring solution into computer
do not flood the tubes
on the daiias in the conn
eyeing ryan mancuso opens a mike whats he doing jonesy
has he l f ooded his tubes
hes just matting there
hold on hull popping
targets coming shallow
the crews a cased spring
ryans walking on what does it mean
it means hes a very cool customer sian
he knows were here and that we are ready to fire
but hes not going to provoke us
hes heading to periscope depth to see whats on the surface
whats his course now
target is on course north
right ten degrees rudder
steer course north
report all contacts
my only contact is sierra thirty five red october
bearing two seven zero
fire control range to target
range is three hundred yards
diving oar make your depth sixty f f ve feet
he wants to go up and take a peek well play along
red octobers periscope appears
seconds later three hundred yards away the dalla scope breaks the surface
ramius is glued to the eyepiece of his periscope
he spots the dallas scope in the water
behind him sailors are tense wary
uncomfortable borodin sweats at fire control
weapons are armed
tubes one and two are not ficoded
mark this bearing
bearing zero nine zero
in the conn mancuso is glued to his scope just like ramius
ryan can hear his heart nq all right mr
you wanted to
talk to him
there he is
what do you want to say
ryan chooses his words carefully
as he does mancuso hits a periscope light in morse american government told you intend to launch mis
do not approach u
do not approach u
coast or you
if you understand ping once
he can do that cant he
he can do that
but is he gonna do that
in the conn ramius is still at
the scope watching the light in the dalla periscope
after a moment he glances at borodin verify the range again
ping one time only
in the conn mancusos at the scope
ryan is scribbling something on a pad
sailors hear a ping
send him this
are you out of your mind
just send it
and ten him to ping again if he agrees
in the conn ramius is at the scope watching the flashing light
after a second he steps back face white
finally he turns to verify the range one more time
but captain i just give me a sounding vasily
ping once only
borodin goes to work
ramius stares at melekhin
what the hell is happening
in the conn mancuso ryan and the crew hear another ping
i need to look at a nautical chart
do you have ryan whats going on
if the soviets want us to sink red october
we just might have to oblige
black as night reverberating with eerie nightmares
from the cloying dark red october rises a shimmering phosphorescent giant
off the coast of iceland morning of the fourth day in engineering petrov and melekhin stand at a sink on the reactor bulkhead
valves and tubing hang over the sink
technicians in the background
melekhins in rubber apron gloves and plastic face shield
dressed identicamy petrov halls a book
signs on the wall indicate radiation danger
shut valve three
valve three shut
he shuts a valve with a large wrench
turning a page petrov place flask under valve four and draw one hundred m peter coolant sample
placing flask under valve four
a tiny stream of fluid fa ls into the flask
unexpectedly an alarm goes off
shut the valve and secure the sink
melekhin shuts the valve
petrov stares at the alarm
below it a meter is flashing red seal that sample in a plastic bag and take it to the lab
ii get the captain
drinking tea and munching black bread in red octobers wardroom
nobody else around
borodin smiles at ramius fondly do you think they will let me live in montana
i think they w let you live wherever you want my find
then i will raise rabbits in montana and marry a round american woman who will cook them for me
and she will have friends who are indians and we wiin ride horses on sunday
petrov barges in talking as he enters captain there are high esaosion product levels in the primary coolant
i knew we should have checked the reactor before we started it
when the caterpillar broke down the vare must have been damaged
keep your vcadoe down doctor
there are several explanations listen to me
radioactive fuel is in the water
if it gets into our air it could loll us all
i said keep your voice down
the i will not
we have a level four radiation leak
and if something isnt done were all going to die
suddenly petrov remembers where he is
ramius eyes are bullet holes
wilting petrov stammers forgive me captain
but its probably a piece of corrosion in the pipes
now lets take another sample
we dont want to panic the crew
melekhin and petrov prepare to draw another sample at the sink
ramius stands behind them
technicians to the rear
melekhin struggles with the valve i may have shut it too hard
grabbing the wrench ramius leans his weight on it
suddenly the valve cracks
hot water sprays ramius in the face
melekhin secure the valve before the water turns to steam
desperately ramius tries to plug the hole
the valve breaks
boiling water pours out turning to steam splattering melekhin
alarms go off
ramius bellows evacuate the compartment technicians scramble for the door
searing hot steam chokes the compartment
melekhin screams in try and stop the leak
everybody get the hen out of here
crew members are panicking
alarms are going off
dripping water ramius charges in
on the deck borodin shouts captain radiation alarms are activating in all compartments
engineering is heavily contaminated
radiation is spreading forward
get us to periscope depth
we i ventilate
while the crew works to get the boat to the surface petrov studies a radiation detector
gauges are in a red zone
ventilating wont do any good
ws getting worse
at these levels it is only a matter of minutes
we have to abandon ship
sailors in the conn stare at the captain
ramins bellows alright
pass word to abandon ship
draft a message to red fleet command telling them our location and situation
stand by to abandon ship
stand by to abandon ship
all hands muster on the miss bp deck
designated personnel bring lire rafts
red october rises in angry sea
an emergency door on the sail opens
seconds later a hatch on the missile deck opens also
the sea rages
climbing out on the deck tblllsi and a half a dozen sailors try to inflate rafts
red october pitches and rolls
frurated tbilisi screams into a headset
through the open emergency door the sea crashes
frightened to death shivering sailors in life preservers line up to leave
petrov counts them
ramius stands by sorodin
l ieubenant tbi jsj reports the sea state is too rough to launch the rafts over the she
the men will be gushed
instruct the crew to secure the rafts to the deck
personnel are aboard the rafts we will scuttle the ship out from under us
fighting gale farce winds sailors me out of the hatch and tie down the rafts
around them the hounds of hell are loose on the face of the deep
the last of the crew leaves
borodin is at the periscope kamarov stands by ramius
only offfcers are left
captain major tbilisi reports the crew are secured in rafts and rafts are tied down
we should join the crew and scuttle the ship
do you have a count
have they all been evacuated
i think so
zero angle on the bow
range nine miles
can you classify it
knox class frigate
shes flashing light
stay where you are
do not attempt to submerge or we will are
stand by to be boarded
what are we going to do
theres only one thing we can do
go topside and take care of the crew
i and my officers wall submerge the ship and take her elsewhere to scuttle
the americans must never have this boat
all petrov wants do to is get his ass off the boat
at the door ramius stops him doctor
when you get home
hear many stories about me and some are true
but tell them that in the end i did my duty
borodin slams the hatch behind him and seals it
submerge the ship
the ocean rages
red october sets to submerge
geysers of water and air explode hundreds of feet in the sky as she dives
the blowback is staggering
wild eyed sailors in rubber rafts hang on for their lives
on the horizon petrov spots the american frigate hurtling forward light flashing
a puff of smoke appears fbnowed by a muted explosion
the frigates firing
as the round comes in there is an a hundred yards beyond red octobers bow the sea explodes
the concussion and the storm are mind bending
petrov thinks the worlds coming to an end
in the rafts men slash at ropes binding them to the deck
one by one they drift free of the submerging ship into foaming sea
one sailor cant cut his rope
his rafts dragged under
the frigate fires again
another earsplitting shriek
tons of icy saltwater cascade over petxovs head
gulping air petrov spots the raft and sail r pop back to the surface
red octobers sail disappears
sailors haul freezing men from raging water
hell on earth
bow slicing through the freezing ocean at flank speed
on the fantai a helicopter prepares to take off rotors howling aboard the frigate thirty sailors work various consoles replete with computer terminals status boards and plotting tables
in the middle of the compartment thirties mans the nerve center of the cic
curry has immediate access to both sonar and radio
in the darkness to his left two seahawk one
this is bravo command
you are cleared for take off
on the fwltml of the frigate pilot and copilot are strapped into the crowded cockpit
copilot flips a bank of toggle switches above his head
roger bravo command
seahawk one request vector to target red october
were on our way
the helicopter rises from the fantail of the frigate
in seconds it passes over petrov and his companions floating in rubber rafts in choppy sea
the pilot glances over his shoulder at a sensor operator working a computer behind the copilot torpedo inputs
set and veri ed as ordered
the life rafts converge on the frigate like insects hovering round an oversized queen
in one of the rafts petrov watches as a net is thrown down at him
the p eyeballs the sea as it races by
speaking into a mike roger that bravo one
five hundred yards to the drop paint
torpedo is armed and ready
aboard the fcigate curry turns to one of the shadows seahawk one reports torpedo armed and ready to fire
requests final authorization to drop
petrov and the others climb the nets
halfway up the doctor stares back at the helicopter hovering in the distance
thirty feet above the water the helicopter releases a torpedo in the area where red october went down
petrov climbs onto the fantail
sailors are waiting with coffee and blankets
fuming petrov confronts an officer i protest
what authority do you have to fire
curry coordinates information
ail around him men work intensely
curry turns to one of the shadows seahawk one reports torpedo is launched and running normally at forty knots
i have it on sonar
four hundred yards from drop paint
eight hundred yards
twelve hundred yards
one of the shadows leans forward and presses a button on currys console
the button is marked command control detonate
the in a white uniform and cap
beside him skip tyler leans on his cane concentrating on currys display
pilot studies the sea
suddenly it bulges
a giant mushroom cap rises from the depths as gas bubbles vent
petrov watches in horror as a huge concave impression vents below the helicopter
a huge plume of gas and water erupts skyward
aboard the frigate curry turns to greer torpedo has detonated
and you understand lieutenant
i was never here
that torpedo did not self destruct
it hit the target
now contact the dallas and tell them to proceed
in the conn aboard the dallas with thompson
mancuso has a
in a holster on his belt
thompson reads a message frigate reports phase one completed captain
we are ordered to proceed
now comes the weird part
thompson fo lows mancuso out of the conn into running aft
mancuso and thompson move at speed
mancuso is far i dont like leaving the boat phil
but the orders are specific
were gonna be f ne
rounding a corner they start thompson will never get over how fast mancuso can move
arent guys that big supposed to be slow
this has got to be the craziest stunt ive ever heard of
theres only about two ml k n things that can st l
at the bottom of the ladder they enter ahead of them jones and ryan wait by a ladder beneath an open hatch
like mancuso jones is armed
jones starts up the ladder
mancuso turns to thompson listen
if anything captain
well be all right
mancuso climbs up the ladder disappearing through the hatch
thompson closes it
sitting before a wheel at a brightly lit panel just as cocky as when we last saw him in the mini sub at tylers lab
next to him a copilot checks a clipboard
behind them jones ryan and mancuso climb up through a hatch
jones shuts it
steiner speaks into a headset ox
passengers are aboard
check off complete
request clearance to lift off
gentlemen we have clearance
fasten your belts and grab your nuts
were taking a ride
ryan sits opposite mancuso
jones is to mancusos right
the bulkhead rocks slightly
steiner turns a yoke
eighty percent capacity
homing beacon is five degrees to the right
recommend new course zero seven five
range now five hundred yards
coming right to course zero seven ive
make initial preparations to land
the copilot starts toggling switches
behind him mancuso checks the
in his holster
contact is two hundred yards below
one hundred yards ahead
hit the running lights
black on black
then in a single blinding flash of light is revealed
hovering above it floodlights blazing the dsrv
descending it locks onto a hatch by the sail
copilot turns to steiner we have a seal
skirt is dry
open the hatch
getting up the copilot heads for the hatch
reaching into his jacket mancuso offers ryan a
and he cant change his mind
hes not going to change his mind
willing to bet your life on that
ryan stares at the pistol
sighing he puts it in his jacket
copilot opens the hatch
in the gloom below another hatch
copilot raps on it
somebody opens the lower hatch
mancuso jones and ryan climb down into on a ladder at the forward end of the conn
waiting for them ramins borodin and all the other of awkward silence
nervous borodin drags out a cigarette and lights it
unexpectedly russian cigarette
could i try one
borodin offers ryan a cigarette
kamarov has a light
ryan inhales and coughs jesus
poking fun ryan rolls his eyes
ramius the ice is broken
men shake hands
gentlemen i am marko ramius
i and my offers request political asylum in the united states
before i go any further i want to know whose idea is this impos
our intention was to publicly surrender this boat and request asylum
it never occurred to us there would be a way you could keep it
the idea to stage a radiation leak was inspired you look familiar
do i know you commander
you have a good memory captain
we meet briefly years ago
but im not a naval commander
i work for the cia
im not an agent
im just an analyst
i write books
suddenly high speed screws passing over the hull torpedo
americans are shooting at us
leaning over currys console in the cic aboard the frigate
agitated curry works his computer
what do you mean theres another torpedo
where in hell did it come from
in the conn aboard the konovalov
his crews at battle stations
bonavia mans fire cost al opening a mike tupolev shouts sonar
why hasnt our torpedo impacted
the weapon enabled on the other side of the target
it passed red october before it armed
you had the wrong range idiot
fire again with the right settings
and reload both tubes
thompson stands outside the sonar shack
to his left the cob is behind fire control
beaumont has taken jones position
sierra four one bearing zero one zero
aku a c a
s soviet submarine
hes shooting again
whats the status of red october
dead in the water
they cant maneuver with the goddam dsrv stuck to them
come on mancuso move it
get the hell out of there
bedlam in the conn
tbalisi and jones are on their way to sonar
ramius shouts at melekhin get back to engineering and give me some power
get that damn thing off my boat
mancusos halfway up the ladder
he spots steiner peeking down at i think somebody just shot a torpedo at us
no shit buckwheat
get the hell
out of here
where am i supposed mancuso slams the hatch
scrambling down the ladder mancuso hears ramius bel dwing at borodin who is manning the helm no vasily
i need you in fire control
we must track whoevers out there
borodin heads for fre control
ramius tosses ryan into the chair behind the helm you sit here
do exactly as i tell you
stunned ryan grabs the helm
jones and tbilisi must have made it to sonar
speakers crackle dsrv is away
theres a russian akula about eight thousand yards starboard
its the konovalov
all ahead flank
i told you im just an analyst
i write books
turn that knob all the way to the right
ail around him the world is going stark raving mad
again speakers crackle torpedo in the water
high speed screws
beaming zero two zero
i estimate range at about eight thousand yards
turn the helm to the heft
steer course zero two zero
wait a minute
thats heading into the t o rpedo
you should turn away from it
steady bearing to the weapon
still zero two zero
range about seven thousand yards
turn that helm to the left until the dial says course zero two zero
ryan dont turn that goddam wheel
ryan stares at mancuso then at ramius
deciding he turns the helm left coming to course zero two zero
i think youre heading straight into that torpedo
aboard the frigate
helms greer and tyler lean over the display
curry studies the blips red october is turning directly into the t orpedos path
mother of god
in the conn its a deathwatch
ryan thinks of sally
mancuso stares at ramius
goddamned if hes gonna be the one to whine
torpedo steady bearing zero two zero
range five thousand yards
can you give me any more speed
were going as fast as we can
estimate range approximately three thousand yards
thompsons still outside the sonar shack
the cobs at fare control
as before beaumont works sonar
why is he heading into the torpedo
is he trying to kill himself
we have a solution on the soviet akula
shouldnt we shoot back
she didnt shoot at us
anyway i cant attack a soviet submarine
i have no goddam authorization
in the conn an
payers have turned to stone
torpedo bearing steady at zero two zero
best range nine hundred yards
estimate impact in twenty seconds
what books did you write
i wrote a biography on admiral halsey called fighting sailor
it was about tam in combat ten seconds
i know this book
i have read some parts of it
your conclusions were wrong ryan
halsey acted stupidly
the conn rocks
sound of torpedo breaking up
metal scrapes along the ship
realizing whats going on ill be dammed
combat tack mr
by turning into the torpedo ramius closed the distance before it could arm itself
i never would have thought of it
so were safe
right now the soviet captain a man named tupolev is removing the safety features on all his weapons
he wont make the same mistake twice
behind ramius ryan spots a shadow at the rear of the conn
he cant believe his eyes
the goddam shadow has a pistol in hand
of gunfire sprays the conn
borodin is hit
slamming into the bulkhead he falls in a seated position eyes wide
fire control panel explodes
behind a console mancuso drags out his
and returns fire
the shadow disappears
beaumont rips off his headgear turning to thompson in the sonar shacks door breathing hard jesus christ
in the conn tupa av is furious
he yells at bonavia hurry up goddammit
i want all the enabling devices disconnected
captain i cannot go any faster
in the conn cars crawl from hiding
sparks erupt from wires
fire contra is history
ramius leans over borodin i would have like to have seen montana
and the indians
eyes gtaog captain
raging ramius pounds the bulkhead
kamarov notices a light on a panel hes in the missile compartment
the ship is yours
but the control is blasted to hell
i cant shoot
then get behind him and stay there
dont let him put you in his sights or were all dead
mancuso tosses ramius his
catching it ramius splits
a caged tiger in the conn on the konovalov
bonavia turns looking back at him enabling devices are removed
sonar give me a bearing on red october
shes taken position behind us
left full rudder
t shake him loose
in a passageway outside a door to the missile compartment ramius and ryan hug the bulkhead hell break into a panel and short circuit the wiring on a missile
well be blown to pieces
taking a deep breath ryan follows ramiais into the coming face too face with a barrage of gunfire
ramius is hit
ryan drags him into a space behind an electrical panel
mercifully the shooting stops
ryan checks ramius
his shoulders a mess
mind riling ryan studies his surroundings
hes never felt so alone
the compartment is vast dominated by twenty tussle tubes six feet in diameter
overhead a catwalk
at the aft end somebodys working with a wrench
we must stop him before he gets into a panel
ryan stares at ramius
ramiii isnt gonna stop anybody
resigned ryan finds the
mancuso gave him in his pocket next time memos
be careful what you shoot at in here ryan
the compartment is very sensitive
in a daze ryan starts walking aft still mumbling be careful what you shoot at ryan
on red october a handful of men struggle to fight the ship
kamarov mans the wheel
sonar speakers pop hes going deep
twenty degrees down on the bowl the wall becomes the floor
fighting to keep his balance ryan walks on the wall still mumbling sensitive stuff
i have to
the ship turns
wall becomes cuing
grabbing the catwalk ryan hangs at a ninety degree angle
bullets rip into the bulkhead inches from his head i have to be careful what i shoot at
he doesnt have to be careful
he can shoot at anything he wants
aboard the frigate curry hunches over a console
greer and tyler the akula is too fast
no way red october can stay behind her
lts only a matter of time now
the akulas turning
shes fired another torpedo
this one cant miss
in sonar jones and tbzisi hear pinging become louder more frequent
holding the mike ashen another torpedo captain
it has enabled and is active
it has acquired us and is homing
red october looms into view
to the right the konovalov shimmers in the dark
between them the torpedo appears
pings grow closer and closer
at the last minute raves into view rocketing forward at full bore streaking between red october and the torpedo
its really something
aboard the frigate curry shouts jesus chi i t
the dallas has moved between red october and the torpedo
the torpedo is chasing the dallas now
in the sonar shack
beaumont works his equipment speaking into a conn sonar
torpedo is in acquisition
range five hundred yards and c nsing
youve done it mr
on the dallas thompson stands on the deck
the cob is at ballasct control holding the emergency blow handles
chief release counter measures and emergency blow all main valves
lets hope to christ this works
signal ejector station
release counter measures
shriek of the blow is deafening
the deck angles crazily upwards at thirty degrees
gear crashes to the floor
eardrums shattering thompson holds on fighting gravity
the dailas heads for the surface
counter measures head for the bottom
the incoming torpedo chases the counter measures disappearing into the abyss
the da a erupts from the water at thirty degrees her bottom exposed well aft of the sail
a broaching behemoth she crashes back into the sea displacing tons of water
neither soviet nor american sailors on the fantail can believe their eyes
peirovs jaw drops
has the entire world gone completely insane
in the missile compartment blood pounding ryan leans flat against a missile tube
on the other side of the tube metal fans on rounding the tube ryan holds the
at arms length
kneeling before him directly in front of an open panel on the missale bay is a sovvet sail or with crazy eyes the cooks assistant who witnessed the putin key
hes got a hot wire in each hand
time stands sthl
ryan stares at loginov
loginov stares back
theres something in the loginovs eyes an uncompromising irrational vi lainy that asks no forgiveness
for a moment ryans paralyzed a rabbit before a cobra
deliberately loginov begins to move his hands together bringing the wires closer
ryan tri es to speak
loginovs grin cracks wide like a rotten egg
flame leaps from the barrel of the
the pistol kicks like a mule
loginov is delivered to eternity
impotent the wires fall to the floor
flushed tupolev towers over fire oontrol seated before him bonavia tries to hang on to his sanity
range five hundred yards
match bearings and the
we are too close
i have to set shoot now
tupolev pulls the lever himself
in the conn mancuso kamarov and the others are on pins and needles
suddenly they hear pin gin g
launch transient astern
hes shooting again
left full rudder
weapon is alive
it has acquired
sound of torpedo passing close to the hull weapon passed close aboard
is ong re attack
but not on us
ryan appears with ramius aft of the conn
pinging grows quieter more distant
in the conn tupalev is suddenly confused disorientaed by the wait
i our torpedo missed red october and is homing on us
how could that be
the weapon was not properly programmed
finally pings become a spine tingltng howl
bonavia shouts you stupid arrogant bastard
youve idiled us all
the konovalov disintegrates
billowing pockets of gas embrace the deep
thirty seven hundred tons of steel
and iron rip apart in the blink of an eye
a white mountain of displaced water rises into the air compresses and explodes
in shock the russian crew gapes at the explosion
the young sailor who took courage from ramius makes the sign of the cross
in the conn as the aftershock subsides ryan helps ramius up off the floor trying to make him comfortable against a bulkhead captain tupalev has just provided your pantomime with
the one thing you could never have managed
in his office seated across from lysenko with the depth of the water and the wreckage scattered over such a wide area it we
be a long time before anything is recovered
your people are already interviewing the crew and making arrangements for their r turn
lysenko nods this has been a terrible tragedy mr
i can only stress that if youd come to us earlier it might have been avcdded
i appreciate your candor in the matter
and i yours andrei
perhaps in the future the technology will be available for a more thorough i n vestigation of the wreckage
a long beat as the two men stare at each other
lysenko finally breaks it off there is another matter
one i am reluctant to no
please go ahead
one of our submarines an akula was last reported in the reykjanes ridge
we have not heard from her for sometime
pelt stares at him blankly time hangs suspended
finally peat reaches far the bridge of his now as if to stave of a dtler youve lost another submarine
lysenko sits hat in hand
finally he averts his gaze
standing beside a limousine outside the executive office building
fuming lysenko approaches
the driver smiles
not a good idea
dont speak to me boris
dont ever speak to me unless i speak to you first
and wipe that smile off your face
lysenko pbe into the limo slamming the door as hard as he can
locked inside he starts shouting and hitting things
on the tree studded bank of a large coastal river
a gentle breeze touches the trees and punctuates the silence
crickets and frogs sing on the shore glides quietly up the rivers surface
ramius and ryan stand on the sail
behind them two junior officers one american and one russian conn the ship were two hundred miles from the nearest naval base
interesting notion hiding a submarine in a river
how do you know this place
i grew up not far from here
my grandfather taught me to f sh right over there on that rock
ramius spots a large rock on the shore
so warm and inviting this land when compared to the bitter cold coast he eft a ifetl me ago
ram hl studies ryan in the stillness there is one question you have not asked me
i assumed you would speak when you were ready
are standing on part of the reason
ive spent my life preparing to fight a war i hoped would never happen
this ship was not built to fight such a war
it was built to start one
and there were personal reasons
it started there perhaps
ramius glances at the rock
beside it a muskrat drops quietly into the water
or perhaps it was something that started long ago
taking a deep breath ramius studies the surrounding hills
lights from farms twinkle in the night air
the sea will grant each man new hope as sleep doth dream of home
on ryans look christopher columbus
welcome to the new world sir
walking down the aisle of an airplane checking passengers
stopping near the front of the cabin she glances down at sound asleep in his seat empty tea cup on a tray beside him
a blanket hangs on one log
in the seat next to him smi out at passing clouds
the bears got a red ribbon round his neck and a seat belt fastened over his bulging tummy
covering ryan with the blanket the stewardess leaves
tea cup rattles
ryan doesnt even twitch
turbulence is a thing of the past
