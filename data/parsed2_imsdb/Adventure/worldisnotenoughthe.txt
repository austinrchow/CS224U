geneva switzerland an unnaturally clean city that melds old europe with new money of both dubious and legitimate source
an engraved brass plaque announcing the name of the private banking institute within
james bond dressed impeccably as ever is being frisked by three thugs in armani suits
they remove a gun from inside his jacket a well concealed knife a metal case laying them on the desk that separates bond and
an extremely well groomed gentleman
behind him three floor to ceiling windows lead out to a rooftop garden
not the usual swiss procedure mr
bond but you understand a man in my position
which is neutral no doubt
lachaise takes the joke a little tight lipped
gestures for bond to sit
a girl enters a gorgeous swiss bombshell in a pin striped suit
she pushes a cart
on it are a briefcase and a box of expensive cigars which she offers to lachaise and bond
it wasnt easy but i retrieved the money
no doubt sir robert will be pleased to see it again
the efficient cigar girl brings the briefcase to bond setting it in his lap and opening it up
inside is a good deal of cash in pound sterling
in the current exchange rate minus the fees of course and certain unforeseeable expenses
here is the receipt
the cigar girl offers bond a receipt
would you like to check my figures
she steps back
bond reaches for the metal case on the desk
the thugs tense
bond can have his glasses
he puts them on gives a cursory look at the receipt
an odd number in pound sterling calculated down to the penny
its all there
bond folds the receipt slips it into his wallet
then he removes the glasses slowly deliberately eyeing lachaise
i didnt come for the money
the report you sold him was stolen from an mi agent who was killed for it
he takes a photo from his jacket and lays it on the desk
i did not get the report from an mi agent
who did you get it from
i am just a middle man
i am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner
and we know how difficult that can be for the swiss
controlled fury your last chance
take the money
your last chance
give me the name
stripped of all your weaponry you still threaten me
an armani thug steps up and takes out a gun
perhaps you failed to take into account my
bonds mouth edges into a smile
a flicker of doubt on lachaises face as bonds finger finds a protrusion on the tiny arm of his glasses and
the pistol on the table flashes
blinding those around they cover their eyes stagger back
it is a brief effect just enough to disorient the thugs and give bond his opening
he karate chops henchman unconscious taking his gun
kicks henchmen in the face and throws out the window just as theyre getting their bearings
now he nestles the barrel of his borrowed hand gun into the hollow of lachaises cheek
i cant tell you
bond cocks the gun alright alright
but you must protect me
and he freezes
the handle of a throwing knife is sticking out of his neck
bond looks up catches sight of the cigar girl as she vaults out the broken window and onto the roof
bond rushes to the window
she swings on a wire across to another roof quickly disappearing into shadows
bond can hear sirens approaching
he returns to
he grabs the money and moves fast for the door casually slipping that cigar into his pocket
except henchman has recovered blocks his way gun in hand
he starts to squeeze the trigger when a red dot appears on his chest
another window shatters as a bullet zings through and pierces the henchman in the heart
bond looks back once at the shattered window then heads out
bond appears on the top floor of the grand old building by the elevator
looks over the balcony sees figures on the stairs
hears the elevator cage start from below
thinking fast he wrenches open the steel gate leans into the lift shaft watches the elevator counterweight as it comes down
almost nonchalant he steps out
as the cageful of police rises bond is now standing on the counterweight descending
faceless business crowds heading for their brief moment of freedom among them we spot bond
one of them with a briefcase and a suit and tie
hold on his face troubled
the cigar girl enters a huge high ceilinged room
edgy she approaches a big man standing on a balcony overlooking the city
propped against the doorframe an assassins rifle with laser sight attached
binoculars are on a tripod trained on the rooftop below where we can see cops examining the shattered office windows
the man turns
powerful deadly with a military haircut
there is a raised red scar of an entry wound at his temple
it throbs and shifts with the slightest facial expression like an insect living just beneath his skin
one eye seems slightly drooping deadened
the other eye is sharp and black as anthracite
it is a frightening face
this is renard
whats his name
our friend from mi
one of ms more accomplished tin soldiers
he could identify me
if it concerns you
he touches her cheek and moves into the room pouring two glasses of wine
lets toast this james bond
were in his hands now
a seaplane swoops over the millennium dome banks along the snaking river
tate gallery in background the seaplane moors beneath the vast stepped cake that is mi
bond exits with the suitcase
camera moves with bond as he enters this secret hi tech world
he passes through countless security procedures watched by an attentive staff
bond scoops the money out of the suitcase
three million sterling in tightly bundled hundreds makes quite a sight
he flicks his finger through the last wad tosses it down wistfully
a blue light scans it on three axis
the money is bundled into a clear plastic bag put on a tray and wheeled through a series of barred enclosures into the secure room
bond hands the suitcase to a staff member
have this checked see what you can get off it
bond appears hiding something behind his back
brought me a souvenir from geneva
he produces the cigar now in a large phallic tube
stands it end up on the desk
thought you might want one of these
beat deadpan i gave up a long time ago
nods to ms door shes in with sir robert
sir robert king is perched on the edge of ms desk
two glasses a bottle of scotch open
sir robert king james bond
king moves toward bond with an easy patrician smile
bond notes a tiny badge in his lapel like the glass eye of a stuffed snake
thanks for getting my money back never expected to see it again
youre the kind of man i could use
though i wont offend certain parties by asking you to join king industries
king looks to m smiling
constructions not exactly my line
quite the opposite in fact
she couldnt resist
king smiles at bond
as he goes he gives m a respectful kiss on the cheek
the door closes
i knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world
hes a man of great integrity
who buys classified reports for three million pounds
m picks up the report from her desk
bond notices it is in russian with a seal from a russian military agency in the corner miratom
its a report on weapons security in the former soviet union which as you know is shaky at best
hes had several instances of sabotage at the pipeline and hes understandably concerned
he called me the moment he realized its sensitive nature
she pours a scotch for bond
he drops some ice in thoughtful
someone was watching over me in geneva
a guardian angel with a laser sight
he stops rubs his thumb and forefinger together a strange sizzling where he touched the ice
realization sinks in
m sees the seriousness in his eyes stabs at the intercom moneypennys eyes shoot to the intercom console filtered moneypenny stop king leaving
flicking switch security sir robert king and an mi aide walk toward security
q and his men are working on a strange half built boat suspended over a water tank
the hydro boat can operate in three inches of water
he looks up as bond runs through
the money lies on the tray wrapped in plastic
sir robert approaches two rows of security bars between him and the cash
an official produces a bag and moves toward it thanks but ill count it myself
apologetic smiles lifetime habit
bond shoots around the corner just in time to see sir robert disappearing past the thick steel door of the secure room
the shout is muffled sir roberts more interested in the money
he continues toward camera that pin on his lapel emits a serene hum and we mayhem
fire blasts out of the open doorway just as bond reaches it
the steel door flies toward him
he dives the building rocks
smoke is pouring from a hole thats appeared in a lower tier
a wall and a section of roof gone
a figure staggers out shaken
catching his breath
lining up bond with her infra red telescopic sight
in the swirling dust and smoke he suddenly sees a wand of red light pointing at his chest
all instinct he dives for cover
powerful high velocity bullet hits blanket the area
bond prepares to return fire scanning around for the source
through the debris he spots an unusual hi tech boat on the river long and narrow and low
a figure on board
the cigar girl
she fires off a round of shots forcing bond back into cover
then she guns the engines and speeds off down the thames
determined bond races back into the wreckage
bond races through the chaos that is mi and into
where he leaps into the prototype boat
its not finished
bond looks at the mystifying number of buttons and gadgets presses something red and
the boat leaps out engine james bond in the q boat shoots out of the mi rubble and onto the thames
bond can see the cigar girl up ahead
he is closing the distance
she catches sight of him in pursuit
she pushes the boat to its limit it roars to a new level of speed
the chase is on
police speedboats alerted by the commotion trail bond
police cars scream alongside sirens wailing
bond is losing ground as he and the cigar girl weave through traffic on the thames
in a gutsy bid to keep pace he corrals the q boat into a hair raising short cut shooting off
he maneuvers the boat under the low pier and emerges even closer to his prey
the cigar girl stops her boat moving to the back manning her large rear mountain machine gun and taking aim at bond
bond continues at full speed fearless in the hail of bullets ricocheting off the vessel
the cigar girl remains calm and cool shooting with precision
bond closes in
cigar girls eyes widen as
cigar girl dives out of the way as her boat becomes a ramp launching the q boat into the air before it dives nose first into the thames
cigar girl gets up from the deck and sees bond turning his boat to close in for the kill
she scrambles to the helm and speeds off seeing ahead of her
just beginning to open to allow for passage of a small tanker
she streaks toward the bridge bond lagging behind
as he looses her boat in the distance he makes a desperate move
he cranks the wheel of his boat and veers off up a slipway and into
where the boat hydroplanes on masses of surface water and propels him into the hurtling boat causes mayhem and panic as he wrestles with the controls jetting off the street
and straight toward
bonds boat crashes right through it sending diners leaping in every direction
the q boat shoots out over the balcony and splashes down once more into
cigar girl is now clearly in his sights
she is amazed to see that bond has managed to overtake her
the racing boats dice through an armada of lazy over loaded barges nearly crashing into the much larger vessels
at even pace now
cigar girl attempts to force her way past him but bond punching buttons on the console of the q boat releases a set of catapulting flame cannisters which create a
massive wall of fire ahead of them
cigar girl is forced toward the very edge of the river
the jig is almost up and then
she spots the launching of a hot air balloon from the base of the massive millennium dome
she skids her vessel to a stop at a nearby pier and quickly scrambles out of her boat
a crowd around a richard branson like figure about to climb into his hot air balloon
the cigar girl brandishing her gun forces her way through the crowd and leaps into the balloon carriage just ready to lift off
she cranks open the gas nozzles and the balloon rises with surprising speed
bond steers his craft toward a slipway adjacent to the pier and shoots up into the air
an amazing sight
bonds boat sailing through the air just beneath the balloon
with split second precision he reaches up and grabs one of the ropes dangling down from the balloon
bond finds himself being carried through the air as his boat falls away from him hitting the ground and erupting into a ball of flame
as bond is carried higher and higher the cigar girl begins firing at him over the edge of the carriage
bond with one hand returns fire
cigar girl then leans over the edge of the carriage and begins to slice the rope that bond is hanging from
the fibers split and fray away from each other as
bond falls heading straight toward
the millennium dome which the balloon has drifted over
as he plummets downward
bond never surrendering still fires his weapon up at the balloon
a bullet hits the gas tank
the balloon explodes in a massive fireball taking the cigar girl with it
bond lands with a spectacular thudding bounce the roof of the millennium dome breaking his fall
he slides uncontrollably down the slope of the dome as scraps of burning balloon rain down all around before he falls off the edge of the dome and lands with
a thud on
he struggles up wincing in searing pain as his hand goes to his injured shoulder
he hold it and looks up into the sky as we zero in on the iris of
reflecting the massive smoke cloud from the explosion as the screen transforms into
a chapel atop a green slope overlooking the waters of loch lomond
a long line of mourners files out at the end of a memorial service
they mill about on the lawn among them m grim faced bill tanner chief of staff and james bond his arm in a black sling
bond ever vigilant scans the crowd
its like a state funeral
rich and powerful people government ministers chief executives from around the world
far off on a distant rise he sees a big man not one of the mourners but an isolated observer standing alone wearing sunglasses and a military haircut
the man seems to see bond looking at him
bond well meet you inside
bond looks at her for a brief second
when he turns back the man is gone like an apparition
bond walks off up the grassy slope toward the rise
bond stands on the hill looking below
he sees nothing but a green carpet not a tree to hide behind
he hears a crunch of leaves
a woman in mourning black coming up the hill
her china doll face is both fragile and proud
beautiful isnt it
she steps up to the ridge with him
a breeze blows her hair
they stare out
the suns rays have broken the clouds and strafe the valley
today of all days the sun decides to shine
perhaps sir robert had a word with the man upstairs
im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover
you knew him well
the sun glints off her bejewelled earlobe
he was my father
he died before he could complete his lifelong dream
beat i intend to finish it for him
a voice interrupts them calling from the estate
she walks away the wind pressing her dress against her delicate figure
she looks brave and vulnerable as she walks back toward her fathers grand house
m bond and tanner in the rear of a limousine
the vehicle swoops through the epic countryside of the scottish highlands
running king industries
she broods ive known that girl all her life
im not sure she knows what shes walking into
shes not a girl anymore
m looks at bond
eyes his sling
ive scheduled a medical for you
its barely a scratch
the dome broke my fall
well at least it turned out to have some purpose
bond gives her a look
no one goes into the field on this unless theyre
greatrex is waiting
the limousine swoops under the portcullis into a courtyard
adjust angle to reveal huge antennae and satellite dishes within
bond walks through the corridors
just before he enters the medical room he removes his sling and casually drapes it on a suit of armor
bond sits on the couch shirt off awaits the results of his medical
the very attractive doctor greatrex looks at her notes
dislocated collar bone
if any more tendons snap
looks up it wont just be two weeks out of action
i need you to pass me fit now molly
she moves to him touches the scarred and bruised bone
its just a scratch
it wouldnt really be
his hand comes up rests on her waist
cant we just skirt the issue
and he pulls down the zip on her skirt
flicks the clasp and it drops to the floor
she shakes her head as he starts undoing the buttons on her shirt
shes very business like despite whats happening
if you showed sufficient
promised to slow down
cut out running jumping
all kinds of
and he pulls her toward him they kiss
her shirt drops to the floor
she pushes him back lies on him
just wearing knickers now
between kisses then maybe id be
open to that
smiles perhaps after this
i could come for a second opinion
a huge chandelier dominates the vast stone room
several agents listen to the debriefing
robinson and m watch tanner explain things he holds a fifty pound note and kings lapel pin now blackened fused melted to expose electronics beneath
the money was dipped in urea dried and packed tight
in one note the metal strip had been replaced with a combustible magnesium circuit in effect a tiny detonator
king always wore a pin in his lapel an heirloom called the eye of the glens but someone switched it for a copy a ceramic micro circuit emitting an electronic
on bond as he enters the room
he hangs back in the shadows watches tanner mime the pin moving to the note when he came within range of the money boom
m steps forward
her fury controlled
weve been pawns in someones game
they tricked us into bringing the money to king
not just elaborate
cost three million plus
suddenly the chandelier darkens the floor brightens into a vast screen showing a satellite image of central asia and the mediterranean
m and robinson walk onto the screen
cheap if it achieves your aim of de stabilizing the western world
she causes the desired stir
bond steps forward from the shadows to get a better view
m sees the sling has gone
what do you know of the caspian sea
caviar capital of the world
firm yet subtle
m looks askance largest landlocked body of water on earth
hitler wanted it
stalin beat him to it
and now its up for grabs a goldrush
far more oil than anyone thought
latest estimates six trillion dollars
itll make the gulf look like a puddle see us right through the new century
the problem is getting the oil out of there
there are four pipelines in the works
three to the black sea shipping out through the bosphorus
all vulnerable to unstable governments or russian blockade
so sir roberts goes through turkey direct to the med
a huge project
the most expensive of the pipelines but the one supported by every western leader
none of the american oil companies were willing to take it on
but king has connections to the region
he married into the vavra family rich local industrialists
he used those connections to hold it all together
kill the man kill the pipeline
not with elektra taking over
tanner notices a red light start pulsing
he moves to m your call to the pm
m nods grimly
as robinson distributes sealed envelopes our credibility has been hit hard
we have to hit back harder
they open their envelopes but bond received nothing
to bond im waiting for the report on your medical
bond is brooding
an ancient nook chock full of hi tech equipment
bond concentrates on a screen displaying photographs newspaper and television clips all to do with kings life and times
bond touches the screen on a photo of
one story dominates the kidnapping of elektra king
a polaroid of elektra savagely beaten ear bandaged holding a newspaper beneath the photo is scrawled
somehow managed to shoot two of her captors and escape
police video elektra interviewed bruised emotional
the leader the one who escaped
can you describe him
he shouted all the time bond touches elektras face freezing her tears
his eyes wander to the photo with the ransom demand
a thought forms
he takes out his wallet opening it and removing e
the strange figure in pounds
bond taps some keys
the words exchange rate appear on the screen
pounds to dollars
pounds sterling and through multiplication by the exchange rate this becomes us dollars
he stares at it
bond paces the flagstones footsteps echoing
bond opens the door on m who stands alone by the window looking out at the long shadows on the moors
tell me about the kidnapping of elektra king
she turns her brow furrowing
who told you to look at elektras files
i took the initiative
you havent been given an assignment in this case
i was the one who brought that money in
im well aware of your stake in this
if you have a point get to it
the amount of money that killed robert king is the same amount as the ransom demand for elektra
he hands her a slip of paper
whoever kidnapped elektra is the same man who killed her father
m looks at the paper a long time
its a message
he wants us to know hes back
this is serious renard
a huge transparent d image of renards skull floats in the centre of the room
other images of him on wall screens
sir robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own
resources at first
when elektras ear was delivered to him in the post he came to me
measured i advised against paying the ransom
i knew it was renard
i played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him
sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist
how many deaths is he responsible for
how many innocent people
you may only get one shot at a man like renard
same circumstances id do the same again
she turns to the hologram
we sent down to kill him
before he could elektra escaped
a week later our man caught up with the target
put a bullet in his head
beat that bullet is still there
bond moves toward the ghostly renard
we now see the bullet he survived
the doctor who saved him couldnt get it out so renard killed him
when interpol found the x rays there was mild jubilation
effectively hes a dead man
she presses a button the hologram turns
the bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata killing off his sense of touch
he feels no pain
he can push himself harder longer than any normal man
that which does not kill me makes me stronger
now robert is dead
he got his revenge
hes not through yet
renard doesnt blow up five million dollars unless he knows theres more coming in
hes working for someone
someone who wants to stop the pipeline
and they hired the perfect killer
one with a vendetta against king
moneypenny enters with a file which she hands to m
m looks over the file his medical report
i see the good doctor gave you glowing testimonials
hes always been good at oral exams
moneypenny disappears out the door
m is all business
get out to the pipeline
find the insider who switched the pin
if your instincts are right renard will be back
he hasnt completed the job
the pipeline is still going forward and we have elektra to thank for that
the worm on the hook again
they exchange a look
a look of recognition between two professionals who know the terrible price of what they do
a scot in a kilt plays the bagpipes badly
he spins round drops the pipe from his mouth simultaneously fires bullets from one pipe and a jet of flame from another
the target is a realistic dummy now a molten bullet ridden mess
were in qs laboratory
hes walking bond through
scottish heavy metal q
oh pipe down
irritated hands over a watch your th
try not to lose this one
it has dual lasers and a miniature grappling hook with fifty feet of high tensile micro filament able to support pounds
in the background we see a man in a sleek black jacket
the man pulls a string
the jacket becomes an airbag
it envelopes him he gets impossibly tangled in it
q ignores it handing bond a new pair of glasses
sort of x ray vision
for checking concealed weapons
and other uses no doubt
abuses in your case
you destroyed my hydro boat in less than seven minutes as no doubt will be the case with this
he presses a button and a section of ceiling lowers to reveal a bmw z
a man in a white coat is loading a missile into one of the headlamps then steps off the platform
q gestures to him
my deputy assistant
im grooming him to follow me
to man that would make you
ahh the rampant wit
i of course am laughing inside
but i dare say youve met your match in this machine
touring the car the absolute latest in intercepts surveillance and countermeasures
titanium plating and armor a multi tasking heads up display
all in all rather stocked
fully loaded i think is the term
r pats the fender hes pretty damned fond of his machine
do take good care of her
a hot day
camera soars over tall trees
we can just make out the sleek muscular car beetle black and far below bouncing over rough terrain
bond taking care of his new bmw z
we join bond at the wheel driving hard loving it pushing up extreme inclines smashing through overhanging limbs
bond reaches a perimeter fence manned by a guard
the guard examines bonds pass and waves him through
as bond drives on he passes an area where helicopters trailing giant saws are trimming back trees
felled trees are being dragged away being replaced by huge metal sheets
an incredibly fast and well oiled operation but why
bond pulls up at the construction site teeming with ultra modern robotic construction machines and vehicles
he gets out and is immediately surrounded by men with guns
a man in a suit steps forward
davidov is tall blonde with a dangerous charm bond instantly recognizes as ex kgb
he turns bond around hands on the car
pats him down
pulls out an id checks it excellent english bond
a government man
im afraid since you english got the boss killed weve been a little
bond stares ahead watches a private jet swoops past
the jet lands on a runway of the metal sheets bond saw being laid as he passed
davidov pulls out bonds gun
re gun id rather you didnt play with that
davidov ignores him looking the gun over
bond turns to watch a lifting helicopter swoop in and drop down an air conditioned office
davidovs radio crackles out a message and he tosses the gun back to bond
they start walking pleasant sorry about all that comrade
old habits die hard
i am head of security
bond eyes him but is distracted by a jet coming to a halt ahead of them
stairs swing down and out steps elektra king
so out of place in this world of men
she surveys the worksite
impressed bond takes his id back from davidov
bond and davidov step into a fully functioning office
everything elektra requires is here
computer phones drinks cabinet
she is in the middle of a group of workmen and secretaries looking at plans talking pouring herself a cup of coffee
to foreman they should have been in place two days ago
that is the target my father set
weve had some trouble with the villagers at ruan
some sacred burial plot
james bond here to see you
she looks up
a brief moment of recognition
then back to business
find me the research on the limestone deposits go ahead and place these orders and get the jeep ready
i will go to ruan myself
miss king i wouldnt recommend
i said i will go
she signs some documents and the men file out
she gets up turning her back to bond hands on her hips
would you excuse us davidov
davidov nods and leaves
elektra still keeps her back turned but he can see her physically change her shoulders sag her arms cross in front of her
when she finds her voice it has a gravelly sound of emotion
i met you at my fathers funeral
i havent been able to recall a single moment of that day
funerals arent exactly memorable
all those horrible loved ones and relatives
i dont want to talk to those people
i just want to
talk to my father
beat i loved him
im not sure he knew that
is that why you want to finish the pipeline
her muscleman body guard appears says briefly the jeep is ready maam
will i be driving with you
we have a guest
gabor glares at bond before he leaves
who is he
he follows me everywhere
hes decisive vigilant
and he makes an excellent omelette
how long has he been with you
since the kidnapping
why do you ask
bond takes something out of his pocket he opens his palm shows it to her
does this look familiar to you
its my fathers pin
he wore it everyday of his life
she swallows back emotion
looks in his eyes with a sad half smile that unsettles him
are you trying to break my heart
or is it just your way with women
its not the pin your father wore
its an exact duplicate
inside is a tiny electrical detonator
we have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice someone who worked at this company
if youve come here to look after me mr
bond thank you but no thank you
i have two bodyguards i dont need a third
she starts to walk out
he follows her
the killer doesnt want to see this pipeline continue doesnt want to see you take over
thats every man within a five mile radius
off his look thats why youre here isnt it
you think i cant do it
you think im going to screw up
or get myself killed
i think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone
especially kings daughter
you are wrong mr
in fact i am the only person who can do it
elektra drives the all terrain jeep with casual assurance
bond is beside her cold weather gear in the back
theyre following a huge pipeline passing a blighted petrified forest of twisted iron derelict oil derricks
elektra gestures at the oil fields theyre now leaving behind
receding into the distance a delta of roadways perched on rusting stilts juts out into the sea
my mothers people discovered oil here ninety years ago
the bolsheviks slaughtered them for it
beat some say oil is in my familys blood
i say our blood is in the oil
this is the very heart of the planet
up here in the hills was eden literally
look what the russians did to it
now we have a second chance and this time well do it right
when the other wells have all dried up shell still be pumping her lifeblood to the world
and this proudly of pipeline will be one of the main arteries
bond and elektra travel beside the vast pipe through dramatic beautiful scenery
davidov and gabor in the helicopter watch the jeep below
the jeep reaches a break in the pipe a survey camp flags strings
the survey crew cower behind a wd local tribesman are stoning them from a village carved into the rock
a lot of shouting
before bond can stop her elektra gets out moves toward the tribesmen
the stoning ceases
they know who she is
she begins to speak quietly in their own tongue
a stunning pre byzantine chapel hewn from the rock
flames illuminate beautiful mosaics and paintings on the cavern wall
a coptic priest proudly shows elektra about jabbering in his mother tongue
she answers in his language
bond watches her impressed
we hear the click of high powered electronic binoculars zeroing in on bond and elektra as they return to the survey team
this cant be davidovs view as the helicopter has settled down below
bond is edgy
someone is out there
hes sure of it
he sees davidov and gabor scanning the area as well
elektra speaks to the foreman
send the pipe around
it will take weeks cost millions
your father approved this route
then my father was wrong
the first time elektra has asserted her own authority
the foreman is surprised angry
but he doesnt question her
she moves toward the helicopter says to bond i have to check the upper lines
gabor will drive you back
always wanted to see the upper lines
you dont take no for an answer do you
she shrugs mischief in her eyes
do you ski
bond just smiles
ive been known to
the chopper swoops over snowy wastes
it reaches a mountain peak hovers
the wind is strong buffeting
elektra and bond are both now in ski suits bond wearing a sleek black jacket
winds too strong
just hold her steady
to bond you wanted to see it
she steps into her skis opens the door
wind rushes in
without a moments hesitation elektra leaps out of the chopper and falls fifteen feet landing on the move
unbelieving bond quickly dons skis and leaps after her
below him on the mountain she is already a way ahead
her skiing is fearless
bond likes a challenge
they wind down the slope competitive testing one another enjoying it
after an exhilarating run she stops on the edge of a huge drop
bond joins her
they look down at the snowy valley below
a line of survey flags visible through the middle
were building from both ends
this is where theyll meet
fifteen hundred miles from the caspian to the mediterranean
bond and elektra stand on the mountainside feeling like the only two people in the world when they hear the distant hum they see four objects falling out the back
of the aircraft
as the objects plummet silently toward the earth they pop parachutes their fall slows and then as bond and elektra watch in disbelief
gunfire echoes out from the black shapes now visible as paraskis low flying sleek deadly snow vehicles
bond turns to elektra he has to yell over the sound of the approaching machines
head for that gully ill lure them into the trees
he points her off to one side where a shallow gully offers cover
she skis off to shelter and he skis out
into the open
where the paraskis trail after him
he streaks toward the trees as the vehicles gain on him firing
he makes it to the woods finding cover in the trees whipping in and out of sight as paraski tries to follow sinking lower and lower until
his skids catch on some over hanging branches
the paraski is catapulted into a tree and explodes
coming in to pick up the pursuit of bond is paraski firing down at bond dropping bombs which explode just behind him in the snow
the other two paraskis land and eject their chutes now racing through the woods on the ground
bond looks behind him sees them gaining
he zigzags through the trees and suckers paraski to glance off one tree hit another and wipe out behind
but the remaining predator on the ground paraski is gaining on him
bond bursts out of the trees and finds himself heading toward
he cranks himself right narrowly avoiding a tumble over the edge
paraski isnt so lucky and sails off the cliff to a hundred and fifty foot drop
smiling should have stuck to snowboarding
but the smile is wiped off his face as
an emergency parachute deploys from the back
the paraski does a climbing turn and heads straight back for him
bond skis for his life away from paraski when paraski appears in front of him
one ahead and one behind bond turns back
he has nowhere to go but
he sails through the air and lands on the paraski slashing the parachute with his ski pole before bouncing off and doing an amazing tumbling hundred foot fall to the
snow where he lands on his skis
paraski four the chute tangling in the rotors of its propeller struggles to maintain control his vehicle inexorably hurtling toward paraski both of them having set their course for bond
they are now on a collision course with each other
bond meets up with elektra as above them
the two paraskis collide crashing into the snowy hill above and tumbling down end over end
bond and elektra huddle together as shards and debris rain down on them
an eerie silence
are they gone
all of them
bond nods ripping from his pole a piece of the parachute he slashed and wiping his face with it
he looks at the piece of fabric in his hand
he sees cyrillic letters
undecipherable to us
but there is a look on his face a look of recognition as
an earth rattling rumble grows above them
bond stuffs the parachute fragment in his ski suit as he turns
the exploding paraskis have triggered an avalanche on the slope above
they try to outrun it riding the sliding hill but they havent a hope
the rest of the snow is catching them theyre going to get swallowed
the ground shudders the thunder closing
their ankles are soon covered elektra falls
bond stops pulls her up
theyre about to die
he pulls her to him
hold on to me
shes confused and frightened but does as shes told
they hold one another tight as here it comes the white fury hurtles over them burying them
at the last moment just as their heads vanish from view
the airbag slams open
the snow covers it and them
more and more snow slides over
the rumbling ceases
light emanates from bonds watch
in the shadows he pulls a knife punctures the air bag
it deflates leaving them cocooned in an icy tomb
elektra looks around staring unbelieving
oh my god
were buried alive
but her breath is coming in short irregular bursts
i cant stay here
youre not going to
bond takes a knife from a sheath around his ankle
flicks open the small blade
he starts to cut a hole in the snow above their heads
she stops him
it will cave in
its the only way out
the snow creaks eerily she gasps terror mounting
i cant breathe i cant breathe
bond grabs her holds her tight
she resists bucks
elektra look at me look in my eyes
she does youre alright
everything will be alright
finally arrested by the strength in his eyes she calms
a beautiful expanse of smooth virgin snow
all is quiet
bonds fist punches through the white
he pulls the snow away climbs out
leans in lifts elektra out
bond and elektra stand lone figures in the perfect white
they hear a sound
rescue on its way
an establishing shot of bonds bmw parked outside the ornate villa on the shore of the golden caspian
hallway dominated by a large painting of a bearded man in traditional turkish garb sitting proudly on a horse
davidov gabor waiting pacing
bond is sits in a chair on edge writing something over and over on a small pad of paper
the cyrillic letters on the parachute fragment
a doctor comes down the grand staircase
the men stand
a slight strain to her ankle but otherwise fine
to bond she wants to see you
elektra is standing by the window watching the golden ball of the sun sink into the sea
she wears nothing but a silk embroidered robe the sun shows through it outlining her naked body in soft shadowy curves
are you alright
he is wound tight she senses it
i cant stay
i need to ask you something
and i need you to tell me the truth
who is it
who is trying to kill me
bond looks at her vulnerable fragile trying to be strong
he cannot tell her the truth
i dont know
but i will find him
she stares at him sensing he is withholding something
she turns back to the window
he approaches behind her
after the kidnapping
i was afraid to go outside to be alone to be in a crowd to do anything at all until i realized
pause theres no point in living if you cant
she looks out at the fading sun
i cant huddle in the shadows
i cant let fear run my life
she turns to him
the way i acted in the snow
you must think im a coward
i think youre one of the bravest people ive ever met
she looks up at him into his eyes they are so close
all she has to do is tilt her mouth upward
she kisses him
his hands come up across her back pressing her toward him her body melting into his and then
he pulls back
has to physically step away from her
what is it
you should rest
that was exactly the wrong thing to say
he sees the rebellion flair in her eyes
i have to go
then take me with you
youll be safe here
i dont want to be safe
i have to go to work
he starts toward the door
now whos the coward
he stops his back up
then heads out the door
he passes gabor standing faithfully outside
a modern day casablanca
bond in evening dress in the sumptuous casino
he takes out the q glasses slips them on surveys the room he can see all the weapons carried by the players
all sizes of pistol even the odd grenade
the obvious side effect of this view he can see through clothes
his eyes alight on two girls walking away from him
one of them turns to look back unaware that she is on display
she returns bonds smile
her friend turns to look
bonds smile grows she has a small pistol concealed over one breast
he looks over the lenses and spies someone on the fringes
his old adversary ex kgb valentin zukovsky talking to some suspicious types
zukovsky looks across
bond walks toward him
what brings you here
you of course
i need some information
bond im a civilian
this is my place
used to be the royal familys now its mine
i run my little business i stay out of trouble
looking about mafia warlords diplomats and spies consortiums from every country in the world
a nice little rats nest
offering hors douevres have some of the rats nest caviar
from my own fishery
they buy my caviar drink my champagne lose to my house
he turns to a suspicious looking heavy
let me introduce you to a former colleague of mine at the kgb
dmitri palov you may know him as
the boa is completely bald muscular huge deadly hands
for years i have dreamed of closing my hands around your neck
have you had any therapy since perestroika
why am i suddenly worried im not carrying enough insurance
the boa leaves glaring all the while
youre upsetting my customers
what do you want
how does a terrorist like renard supply his men with state of the art russian army weapons
this is not possible
bond takes from his pocket the fragment of the parachute
zukovsky examines the letters
if i remember my cyrillic that says st airborne division
where did you get this
off a high powered paraski that was trying to kill me
zukovsky shakes his head
the russian army they spend millions on flying skis but they cannot afford to pay the soldiers
the men they do what they have to do to feed their families
in this country for the right price and a pack of cigarettes you can get anything you want
he notices bond watching the hostess bar
a dark alcove of the casino where slinky hookers flatter the guests
everyone does what they can to survive
how high up does this
arms dealing go
if someone wants you dead it is renard
our government has nothing to gain by killing you
but you would have something to gain by killing robert king
and stopping his pipeline
this hits zukovsky
he closes down
a chill between them
the cold war is over
what have you got left
murder in the boardroom
bonds eyes catch something someone entering the casino
his pov elektra
more vibrant than we have ever seen her living up to her name
she is impossibly glamorous in a sparkling dress that fits like second skin
her hair is full and tumbling her eyes are fiery and wild
oh youd be surprised
bond starts toward her but she tosses her head defiant and turns away making her way to the roulette tables
bond follows her across the casino
they are like two cats moving through this neon jungle their energy dangerous and sexy all eyes on them
he takes note as she passes
she finally stops at the no limit table
crowded with the nastiest and richest of the high rollers armenians turks south americans a computer nerd american and a russian industrialists wife heavy with jewelry and drink
zukovsky is suddenly there pulling out a seat for her in the center
weve kept your fathers chair free
and his account
you have a credit line of a million and a half
he gestures to the dealer who pushes ten towering stacks of chips toward her
a waitress is right there to take her order
shaken not stirred
he leans in smiling his charming smile as he says what the hell are you doing here
smiling right back someone wants to kill me id rather die looking him straight in the eye
lightly what are you doing here
looking for a woman a little more your type
how about that one
she points to a show girl in a feather headdress and pasties
if this little show is for my benefit ill take you home right now
you had your chance james
now im looking for a bigger thrill
she pushes half her chips back onto the table letting them stand on her bet
the whole table exhales
then it starts bets are placed gamblers energized by her arrival
bond scans the room vigilant nervous
he zeroes in on davidov sidling off away from the table trying to look nonchalant his eyes shifting this way and that
he looks suspicious as hell
bond watches his blood running and then
davidov slips into the hostess bar
a hooker is soon wrapping herself around him
after a few words she leads him off toward the back
bond returns to the game shaking his head
he watches as a small room
lit by sconces that sport live flames
tacky luxurious a refracted eastern reflection on an old west whore house
davidov undresses in the little bathroom alcove
he faces a small ornate mirror over the sink in which he can see the hooker behind him on the bed
you want to be
on top or not on top
she slowly pulls a pair of silk ropes out from her bra and tied up or not tied up
davidov smiles struggling with his belt
he looks down gets it looks up
his heart stops
it is not the hooker in the mirror but
renards henchman stands by the door an automatic rifle cocked at davidov
dead or not dead
elektra with black king showing
a seven beneath
i understand its normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end
and with a smile she scratches her cards on the table for a hit
the dealer gives her an eight
she reveals her cards
he rakes in her chips
but elektra is undeterred
she pushes another pile forward as the next deal commences
i like the deep end james
the henchman holds davidov against the wall with his huge fist around his neck
near his head the live flame of a sconce hisses burning blue and yellow drawing their fuel from the glass basin of hot oil attached beneath it
the hooker obviously one of renards gang has finished donning her khaki pants and combat boots and straps a gun onto her shoulder
renard looks distastefully at the room
is this how you spend the money i pay you
and with the rest you hire fools who shoot like blind men
croaks out bond
should be dead as well
your failure today is astonishing
it is a disgrace
he approaches close to him stopping at the flaming sconce near his head
do you know why the color is blue at the wick
davidov starts to sweat
because that is where the flame is the hottest
renard touches the glass well of oil
the temperature is close to five hundred degrees
renard uses his knife and pops the seal from the lamp removing the well of oil
a drop of the hot oil falls on his hand and singes it black in an instant
renard does not even flinch
davidov starts talking trying to placate
its all been arranged
then you are completely unnecessary
renard raises the container of oil over davidovs head i have the documents the landing authorizations the security passes
renard stops the oil tilted just ready to pour
his dead eye
has it drooped further since we last saw him
seems to glitter in the light
bond is suspicious
we are moving sooner tonight
we understand each other
renard lets a trickle of oil drop onto davidovs head
he screams as his hair smokes and singes
renard makes a motion the thug releases davidov who falls to the floor clutching his head
zukovsky and others watch as elektra stakes even more
people move closer for a view
the dealer shows a five
elektra shows bond her cards
elektra is holding two eights
dealers up card is a six
stand or split them
he holds her gaze
surely you believe in living dangerously
not at that price
time to surrender
they eye one another a long while sex firmly in the air
she moves all her chips forward
bond catches a look between the dealer and zukovsky the house has no limit
bond looks back toward the hostess bar
no sign of davidovs return
to dealer hit me
the dealer scoops a card from the shoe
everyone holds their breath
as he turns over
the audience inhale as one as the dealer takes all her chips elektra stands
she has dignity in defeat
she turns to bond holding out a hand
time to surrender
bond elektra gabor outside davidov soon joining them trying to look like he hasnt been through hell
bond notices the burn on his head
davidov touches it self consciously
a little accident
a night of burning passion
davidov scowls at him
bond leads elektra away
someone watches bond and elektra move toward his bmw
what about bond
renard and his henchmen watching
renard seems mesmerized by the sight of bonds hand on the small of elektras back their easy sensuality as they both get into the car
seething i will take care of mister bond
bond and elektra emerge from the bmw
behind them gabor and davidov get out of her car
bond watches as davidov slams his door and marches off angry toward the security quarters at the side of the house
bond and elektra walk to the front door anticipation thick in the air
gabor opens the door
elektra sweeps through
bond pauses just inside the open doorway
two figures in the cavernous entrance hall elektra having a brief word with gabor before he turns and exits leaving only
she starts upstairs bonds eyes locked on her body and then she looks back
but it says everything
she continues upward
bond taps the front door closed with his foot
theyre entwined between the sheets
this is something slow languorous not to be rushed
we cant make out the mechanics but theyre beaded with sweat
her fingers trace the contours of his torso
linger on his bruised collar bone
you knew when you first saw me
you knew it would be like this
her hand dips in an ice bucket beside the bed
she rubs a slither of ice down her chest shudders with pleasure
its a move bond hasnt seen before
now she brings the ice to his shoulder
she kisses his purple flesh
needs constant attention
she slides her tongue back and fore along the groove above the tendon
and he pulls the ice from her hand enough ice for one day
tosses it across the room as passion takes over
a puddle of water where the ice fell
post sex on the bed
he traces a hand down her naked back
the sweat glistens off the curve of her spine
the light glints off her jewelled earlobe
he touches it
you never take this off
elektra looks at him
why do men always want to undress the one part of a womans body she doesnt want to reveal
she reaches to the large diamond encrusted earring and gently plucks it away
pulls her lush hair back
the lower half of her ear is gone reduced to a misshapen clump of scar tissue
it is the only mark on her perfect body
a physical reminder of her ordeal
it breaks his heart
how did you survive
i used my body on the guards
it gave me control
i got to a gun and i took my chance
beat ive never told anyone that
they are looking at each other both suddenly feeling something dangerously close to real connection
it is not what bond expected
do you ever stop james
do you ever think about
another kind of life
he holds her gaze for a long time before he looks away
i cant afford to
she frowns slightly
settles into his chest
i know who you are
he holds her eyes full of conflict staring into the dark
the lights of a car pulling up at the security office by the perimeter wall of the property
bonds car several of elektras vehicles all parked around the security office
they have been joined by a white economy car a russian make with a familiar seal painted on the door
weve seen it before the seal on top of the stolen report at the beginning
out of the drivers seat steps
he carries a briefcase from the car to the front door of the security office
he looks around furtively before he disappears inside
the parking area is dark and silent and then james bond sits up in the drivers seat of his bmw
bond sticks his key in the ignition and activates the cars various systems
davidov is a shadow in the office window
bond flicks a switch
a needle thin beam is directed from the bmw to the window of the office
he can hear a synthesis of davidovs voice
im running late
no no ill make it
how will they know im your man
bond hears the click of a phone hanging up
he flicks another switch in his car an infra red tracking system activates in his windscreen
he can now see davidov perfectly as he comes out of the security quarters carrying a briefcase and a large duffle bag which he carries to the car and loads
into the trunk
he goes back inside
bond gets out of the bmw
he moves stealthily to the russian vehicle and using the laser beam on his watch opens the lock on the trunk
it pops open
bond sees the briefcase and the dufflebag and
something beneath them
he moves the objects aside a man is folded into the back of the trunk his head slumped forward dark hair on the back of his head slightly wet blood
bond tips the head back revealing glassy dead bond leans in and plucks a badge from his white shirt pocket
it has a photo of the dead man and reads in english and cyrillic leonid tashka field inspector
on the corner of the badge
the russian seal
the one from the report
bond touches it with his thumb recognizing it
davidov is coming out
bond lowers the trunk door and crouches behind the car
davidov pauses to lock the door
he walks toward the russian car
he is actually whistling a happy tune and then
he has heard something
he draws his gun
he walks around the entire car
when he gets to the rear
the trunk is closed
bond is not there
no evidence he ever was
davidov gets in the drivers seat and starts the car
the russian car drives onto the grounds of a small deserted airport consisting of one outbuilding and a crudely cleared airstrip
davidov pulls off the road and parks his car in a wooded area
davidovs feet crunch in the dirt as he walks to the back and opens the trunk
he removes the briefcase
then the duffle bag
he looks down at the dead body head slumped forward as before
but something is different the clothes not quite right and then the dead body moves the head turns davidov gasps
it is james bond
davidov pulls his hand gun from inside his coat but bond is quicker
with a silenced pistol he shoots davidov in the head
one little red hole forms in his forehead as his eyes go wide and he crumbles dead
bond climbs out of the trunk
crouches to examine davidov
old habits die hard
picks up the briefcase
it is locked
he searches davidov and finds a set of keys in his pocket
he opens the lock
inside the briefcase four stacks of money
documents headed with the official crest of miratom
a new security tag it looks just like the dead guys but has davidovs name and picture
some hologrammed blank security tags and a polaroid type camera
he picks up a blank security tag and inserts it in the camera
points at himself takes a shot
punches in davidov on the keypad
out comes a brand new pass
bond goes to look in the dufflebag but
a plane is approaching
he looks up
a russian military jet appears over the trees flying low its red landing lights blinking
a door opens on the sinister looking plane
a hydraulic step unit folds out of it
a big soldier with a machine gun waits in the doorway
bond standing at the edge of the runway clips on his badge and picks up the briefcase
he has no idea what hes walking into
here goes nothing
he hoists the dufflebag over his shoulder and walks out to the plane
he starts up the steps the soldier points his gun down at him
says something to him bond pauses
and then thinking says romashka
the soldier looks at him then lowers his weapon
the first guy and a moustachioed pilot and two young men a nasty looking private cadaverously thin and a big thick necked tough
they all look at bond expectantly waiting for him to say or do
he decides to take the lead
he opens the briefcase and hands over the stacks of money
the pilot passes it out
but that isnt the end
they still stare at him
the pilot says something in russian that sounds like
wheres the rest
thinks without showing it
he decides to open the duffle bag
he looks inside
pauses then reaches in and takes out
a box of nike shoes
the thin soldier smiles
thats the ticket
bond hands out shoes to the rest of the guys
a red dawn
dominating the landscape a valley of weirdly shaped rocks
to one side an airstrip
the plane approaching
the three soldiers wear their new shoes and smoke and chat amongst themselves
bond sits in the rear of the plane which is dominated by heavily buffered receptacles clearly awaiting some deadly cargo
there is russian writing everywhere and one symbol he clearly recognizes danger radioactive
bond looks out of the window
beneath a huge mesa a huddle of low buildings
they come to a stop near the end of the runway
a small jeep is driving out to them
one of the soldiers throws something to bond
an orange jumpsuit that says miratom on the breast
he catches it
subtitles you have fifteen minutes
bond in the orange overalls and wearing his id tag is driving with a russian soldier through the weird rock valley a cloud of dust from a detonation rises up
on the other side of the hill
they turn the corner and see trucks marked ida several kazakhstan army personal carriers soldiers dotted around ida international decommissioning agency scientists and personnel quietly going about their business
a vast protective bubble is inflated at the front of the building
the sound of breathing loud were looking from inside the visor of a protective suit
its hard to tell whats going on but our hands are removing a sphere of cobalt blue plutonium from inside a corroding warhead
an officer eyes bonds pass
subtitles you are late
the transport documents
bond shows him the case
akakievich examines the documents
subtitles they are waiting for you below
it should be ready
check with the ida physicist
he points toward the bubble
inside the transparent bubble a protective suited figure finishes placing a blue plutonium core into a box
as bond and the colonel walks toward the bubble the figure steps out still enveloped in the white protective suit
moving fast off comes the helmet to reveal a beautiful american girl
christmas jones is mid twenties shortish hair hot right now
in one movement she unzips and steps out of the suit revealing a khaki sports bra cut off shorts heavy duty boots
a nasty looking hunting knife strapped around her hips
she has a deep tan and an incredible figure
she grabs a bottle of water guzzles
bond tosses an arched brow to akakievich who nods bitterly also unable to take his eyes off her
he spits on the floor and speaks in english so christmas can hear
not interested in men
take my word for it
akakievich isnt exactly what youd call a looker
bond offers a disappointed tut as akakievich walks away
he notices her ida tag and an incongruous peace tattoo just above her hip
shes checking him out as well
russian accent yes
viktor davidov miss
no jokes ive heard them all
dont know any doctor jokes
she is wary
its been a long time since a man this attractive stepped onto her beat
they walk toward the building
what happened to len tashka
couldnt make it
the soldiers may give you a hard time
if we werent around theyd have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides rotting in the sun
bond looks at the ominous radiation warning signs
will i need protection
she squints at him taken aback
theres no radiation danger down there
bond turns to go knowing he misstepped
christmas then speaks to him asking a question in russian
subtitles where is this stockpile going
bond turns answers in perfect russian
subtitles to the nuclear facility at penza
watches him disappear into the building
bond descends going down deep
the elevator creaks to a halt
he slides the elevator doors open revealing
two soldiers waiting for the elevator
bond shows them his subtitles see the corporal at the end of the chamber
the soldiers get into the elevator and disappear leaving bond completely alone
dead silence in the shadows
bonds in his element that alert glint in his eye as he takes in his surroundings
a long dark corridor
leading off to a more open circle in the distance lights and an ominous humming there
bond starts down the passageway
ahead of bond like a deadly spider at the centre of a web a nuclear bomb suspended over a pit
blast openings range around to channel its fury to measuring equipment
bond is alone with the bomb
an eerie moment
then he comes to notice a figure across the expanse of the pit on the opposite side of the catwalk a man with his back to him in russian army
the man turns
i see my friend davidov ran into some difficulty
renard starts toward him
bond draws his gun
dont come any closer
you cant kill me
im already dead
he and bond face off the malevolent bomb between them a robot device beginning to lower it into the pit
my men will still steal the bomb and the shot will bring them directly to you
renard gestures into the pit
two of renards men in the pit unaware of what is happening above working directly with the bomb
one of them is using a manual
it is just like the stolen report the miratom seal in the corner
bond aims his gun at renards head
whos paying you to destroy the pipeline
renard resumes walking around the catwalk at the edge of the pit toward bond slowly surely totally fearless
to die by a man who cant even grasp what hes caught up in
bond out of the corner of his eye sees renards man remove a small device from inside the bomb
it is the size and shape of a credit card black with shiny transistors on it
the man slips it into his pocket
revenge isnt so hard to fathom
whats clever is getting someone else to pay for it
not many people in this world have that kind of fortune
bond cocks the pistol
who is it
you think i fear death
i welcome it
i get on my knees and pray for it
you on the other hand you have something to live for no
closer now shes beautiful isnt she
you should have seen her before
flawless and still so innocent not such a whore in bed
bonds eyes flare in fury
he shoves renard into the wall and presses the gun to his temple
you will never touch her
you will never get near her
have you forgotten who saved your life in geneva
consider me ungrateful
its i who should thank you for taking that money back to mi
so distressing for m
an explosion inside her lair
shell get over it
you even brought the plane for us
we really couldnt have done it without you
bond strikes him across the temple with his pistol
renard drops to his knees
he touches his temple looks at the blood curiously feeling no pain
a man tires of being executed
as bond screws a silencer onto the muzzle of his gun but then again
there is no point in living if you cant
bond knows that hes heard it somewhere before
it freezes him just a beat but it is enough
suddenly the noise of footsteps christmas jones with colonel akakievich and two armed soldiers
were with them as they turn the corner of the passageway and see bond with silenced pistol aimed at the kneeling renard classic execution stance to bond drop your gun
keep away colonel
the soldiers guns are trained on bond
he is an impostor
clutching a printout theres no davidov at miratom
heres your imposter
hes paid off the men on the plane outside
theyre not taking the bomb to any russian facility theyre flying it wherever he tells them
christmas is listening but akakievich cocks his rifle
to bond i said drop it
and he means business
but has no choice
he pulls the clip from his gun tosses it down
to christmas well done he would have killed us all
i suppose you to akakievich were you the one who allowed him down
colonel akakievich looks suitably stung
but renard is looking past him now as with a quiet whirr the bomb raises into view on a trolley
renards team is ready to move
to akakievich take him away i dont want him around as we move the bomb
whispered to bond you had me
i knew you couldnt shoulder the responsibility
and renard jams his hand onto bonds shoulder squeezing his collar bone hard
pain jolts through bond he drops to his knees in agony
he shoves bond down
bonds hand goes to his shoulder his mind now racing how did he know to hurt him there
renards men start to maneuver the bomb toward the curving passageway
its all too much for colonel akakievich no the bomb does not go anywhere until i am satisfied
all of you to the surface now
renard stops and turns
bond sees him nod to two of his men one quietly slopes off down the tunnel
the other innocently opens a container
camera shows the inside of the containers lid the man releases a false lining to reveal several machine guns
urgent now very well colonel
we will all go up
one of colonel akakievichs men gestures with his gun that bond should get up
knowing its now or never bond pushes him away yanks a pistol from his holster grabs christmas leaps down into the bomb pit just as renards men open fire
akakievich dies straight away
so do two of his men
the gunfire ricochets around the chamber and ceases
renard hangs back
his radio crackles a message nods into radio shut them
right next to the elevator
he turns a switch that activates two sets of red buttons and two sets of green
he punches one green button
heavy doors close all exits but that to the tunnel
bond and christmas know they are being sealed in
melt down doors
if he gets them closed they wont be opened again for forty eight years
bond peers over the edge sees renard and his men working the nuclear device into the passageway
if bond doesnt get through now theyre trapped forever
he points his wrist watch toward the cat walk above and presses a button
the tiny grappling hook shoots out qs super filament wire that can hold up to pounds is attached
bond uses the rope to rappel up the sides of the pit and into where he leaps on top of renards last man
they fall through the iris it shuts behind them
the man swings his machine gun at bond it hits the wall next to him breaks apart
bond grabs a broken section and kills him with one strike
he pauses at his dead body and reaches into his jacket retrieving
the card like device
christmas looks around desperate to help
using bonds wire she climbs up to the closed iris door
she pries open a panel next to it and reveals complex wiring
up ahead of bond the bomb disappears down the passageway
he can see it is attached to a pulley above helping the men to move quickly renard pulling the two men pushing renard signals one of them to drop back
to cut off bond
machine gun fire turns the wall next to bond to dust bond dives to a recess
an overhead light shatters
his section of the tunnel darkens
bond looks up at the broken light
takes careful aim at the next one along
the other guy answers with another spray of bullets
watches uneasily as bond takes out light after light
a funnel of darkness coming to swallow him concealing bonds approach
nervous he fires muzzle flash and sparks illuminating the void
to keep it lit he keeps firing
with bond as the bullets cease with a loud click
what bond was waiting for
the gunman frozen in the light grappling to fit another clip blam
he goes down
bond not wasting bullets
renard is loading the bomb it into the elevator
he flicks a switch on the panel by the elevator
the iris starts closing on bond
bond rushes for the door but hes shocked as the man he shot lunges
clings to him
bond hits him away he leaps for the cart blocking his way and shoves it into the iris door just as it almost closes
bond squeezes through
renard is getting in the elevator
sees bond made it fires
bond rolls into a corner
we have our fireworks
now you can have yours
and he machine guns some barrels
rocket fuel spills out
he digs a finger into one of the holes effortlessly rips the metal so more fuel cascades out
christmas cuts some wires together and with a hum her iris bond fires at renard hitting his shin
looking down at his shin noticing the blood
inconvenienced but not in pain
he shuts the cage doors
pauses only to fire off half a clip at the switch panel
bond leaps to his feet racing forward firing gets to the elevator as renard disappears upwards with a smile
he points down
bond looks down
beneath the elevator
a makeshift explosive device
sticks of dynamite wrapped around a detonator set to explode eyes wide bond looks back to the doors then to the switch panel now just a chaos of sparking wires
the pipe bomb ticking
bond is trapped
he looks up
he jumps up grabbing it just as
the bomb ignites the spilled oil a fireball shoots along scorching after bond who is sailing through the passage way the force of the blast sending him hurling down the
passageway on the pulley
heading straight for a closed iris door which miraculously begins to open as he ahead the next door is open as well
he sees christmas on the other side
bond hurtling toward her ahead of a massive close the door
close the door
but before she can two of the fuel barrels hurtle through the closing iris clattering into the pit starting a fire below
flames licking up the sides of the pit toward them
bond looks up sees the arm of the robot lifter stretching upward toward an old shaft t the top of the ceiling
he and christmas scramble up the robot arm walk along the spider like web that supported the bomb and find
an old elevator
powered by a hydraulic system
they get in
hear the rumbling of the fire below
the old elevator moves slowly
the rumbling grows louder
shame you had to spot i wasnt the real thing
so who are you
bond bond fires his gun at the hissing hydraulic pulleys and
the elevator shoots through the shaft at breakneck speed as fire shoots up
bond lunges to cover christmas
as the smoke clears finishing james bond
christmas and bond climb out of the duct
through a cloud of dust he can see people running about panicked
theres been some shooting fresh corpses litter the ground
bond looks past them to a plane coming this way
it roars past level with them
he follows it with his eyes helpless as it gets smaller and smaller
they wont get far
every warhead has a locator card
a miratom device
emits a high pitched signal on russian emergency frequencies
we can track the bomb
bond removes the locator card from his jacket and shows it to her
it flashes in the sun
christmas shakes her head disgusted
analysts huddle over monitors showing satellite images trying to track the plane
do we have the range of renards plane
anywhere in this circle
iran iraq pakistan syria afghanistan
elektra king is calling from baku
m is surprised
its a video line
put her on the wide screen
the face of elektra materializes on a large wall monitor
i would never call you except
he left my villa some time in the middle of the night and
m exchanges a look with tanner
my head of security has been found near a local airstrip murdered
m leans on the console in front of her
ill send someone out
could you come
m looks up
elektra on the monitor looks about as lost as she ever has
i just cant help thinking
m stares at the girls face her whole sordid history written there
m turns away from the screen and says to tanner
get me out there
elektras villa against blue black storm clouds the caspian choppy wind blowing
elektra works in her fathers study illuminated by a halo of light from a single desk lamp
pictures of her grandfather and father stare down at her from the walls
the wind blows a window open
she gets up crosses the room shutting the window
she stands there listening to the silence and then
she hears a thud
a strange unsettling thud
she listens a long time to the silence
she goes to the door opens it
it whines on its hinges
she steps into
a big room lined with books
three french doors lead out to a balcony
she walks a few paces in
the door shuts behind her she whirls
gabor propped up behind the door stares wide eyed before he falls to the floor
elektra gasps she turns again
a dark figure looms a shadow against the windows
he moves forward his face becoming visible
she stares at him shocked hesitant
you look surprised
she moves to gabor gets down to help him
he stirs he is alive but unconscious
elektra looks up at bond
whats wrong with you
are you crazy
does it matter
after all whats the point of living if you cant feel alive
isnt that right elektra
isnt that your motto
what are you talking about
or did you steal it from your old friend renard
we had a run in he and i
he knew about us he knew about my shoulder he knew exactly where to hurt me
she begins to tremble
are you saying
renard is the man whos trying to kill me
you can drop the act its over
i dont know what youre talking about
i think you do
he walks toward her threatening
at mi we call it stockholm syndrome
its common in kidnappings
a young impressionable victim
sheltered sexually inexperienced
a powerful kidnapper skilled in torture in manipulation
something snaps in the victims mind
the captive falls in love with her captor
at the word love elektra explodes
she slaps an unsuspecting bond hard across the face
how dare you
how dare you
he disgusts me
you disgust me
so he knew where to hurt you is that it
you had a sling on your arm at the funeral
i didnt have to sleep with you to find that out
he used your exact words
you knew all the time that he was out there that he was coming for me and you lied
you used me you used me as bait
you made love to me what to pass the time as you waited for him to strike
he has no answer
he cant deny what she says
the phone rings cuts through the tension
bond and elektra staring at one another
she lets it ring
then picks up
listens looks to bond
hes struck again
beat five men are dead at the pipeline
he moves toward her
im coming with you
you do what you have to do but ive called in m
shes en route from london even now
the mi chopper lands
we can see m through the window
face set hard
scientific military and turkish police vehicles parked around a medium sized industrial plant
bond accompanies m and tanner toward a clutch of offices
all around soldiers ida personnel police scour the area
to bond glad to see youve turned up
he is moving fast talking fast a sense of urgency
they hit about minutes ago
theres a scientist here from the international decommissioning agency dr
she has ten crews combing the area
they step out of the bright sunlight and into five body bags are being carried out by soldiers
m surveys the scene in an unlit corridor christmas jones and several men sweep the area with clicking geiger counters
elektra is a distance away listening to a turkish policeman explain whats happening
she nods acknowledgement to m
tanner senses that bond wants to talk to m alone ill see how theyre coming with the power
they watch him go
m turns to bond you had your hand on the bomb and you let renard get away with it
he draws her away to a small alcove
takes something out of his jacket
the locator card
the report king bought
its a manual
renards men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead
then robert was right about a russian connection
theyre getting their weapons from the russians but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons
i cant help thinking
the person close to king the one who switched that pin
the inside man
the inside woman
now the lights power up disrupt the intimacy and intensity of their exchange
the room is lined with monitors and a huge satellite map of the pipelines meandering path
but before he can speak elektra calls out gesturing to a dim light flashing on a console in front of her
thats not right
a technician comes over
tanner too followed by bond and m
what is it
its an observation and repair rig
travels along the pipe checks for broken seals
but its not supposed to be there
thinks stop it
the technician flicks two switches
the light continues to flash
confused he tries others
i dont understand
where is the rig
harried the technician activates the wall schematic of the pipeline
a pulse of light travels along the line
and with it a sense of horror descends
the parcels in the post
its heading for the oil terminal
where it can do the most damage
to one of her men have the terminal evacuated
the man gets on the phone
to tech speed
seventy miles an hour
he punches buttons
christmas has come stands next to bond
one hundred and six miles from the terminal
quick itll reach the other end in seventy eight minutes
to tech any more of these rigs
the technician checks his records looks up nods
theres one parked in the passageway ahead of it
decisive christmas heads for the door turns to her team ill need some help
her ida colleagues look sheepish
bond moves to her
for just a moment christmas looks wary unless youd like to see my id first
she almost smiles
m nods to tanner to follow them
bond doesnt look at elektra
but she watches him go
the mi helicopter swoops along the pipeline
tanner is beside the pilot
bond and christmas in the back
they look at one another the danger ahead melting the frost between them
bond and christmas climb through an access hatch down onto the electric rig
its lights blaze fifty yards into the tunnel
christmas takes the drivers spot bond the rear nearest to the approaching bomb
tanner leans in sealing them in good luck
bonds nods checks his watch
christmas looks nervously down the pipe
be one along any minute
and she starts the machine off
it quickly picks up speed its lights flooding the seemingly endless pipe before them
christmas looks behind apprehensive
waiting for the lights of the explosive rig
they travel along expectant
when this is over we should bury the hatchet
a champagne dinner
when this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens
alright then brunch
his lightness relaxes her she appreciates it
elektra m and others
the room is crowded with concerned personnel
m watches the two blips on the schematic getting closer together
one of her men approaches a radio in his ear
tanner reports bond is headed for the rendezvous
evacuate miss king and the others
you can evacuate my workers but im not going anywhere
m looks at her then nods impressed by her courage
bond and christmas waiting expectantly
finally a whooshing noise getting louder
lights appear behind reflecting on a bend then
here it comes the rig tearing through the pipe
bond looks over his shoulder at christmas speedometer
shes only at fifty
get our speed up
christmas presses forward
bond turns his feet out toward the approaching rig
the lights getting closer
bonds rig jolts as the other makes contact
he cushions the blow with his feet
both rigs moving together now he climbs onto the bomb rig
puts out a hand helps christmas across
the bomb sits there daunting deadly
tactical fission device
they look at one another then set straight to work
the room is quiet tense
m and her two men elektra gabor the king technician and three armed security guards at the doors
they are the only ones left
going down with the ship
if it goes
m and elektra watch the two lights now together on the console
a tense silence
elektra perhaps a little more than the rest
she exchanges a glance with gabor
close inside the bomb the timer
bonds face betrays the difficulty of what theyre attempting
the digital clock ticks down
the rigs speed through the tunnel
nothing to see
as the rigs hurtle past
the pipe suddenly dips
they cling on as the machine bucks like a rollercoaster
back on a straight
her brow furrows
the plutonium is missing
theyve taken the core
then its no longer a bomb
back to work urgent its a bomb alright
were still dead if the trigger charge goes off
bonds mind races in the ghostly light of the tunnel
he stares at the timer
makes a decision
let it blow
christmas shoots a look astonished
but we can stop it
taking her arm
let it blow
she cant believe what hes saying
his eyes shoot to an inspection hatch the lights illuminate up ahead
he grabs her wrenches her away from the bomb
the rig zooms past the exit hatch bond leaps off taking her with him
they tumble along the pipe
agile bond springs to his feet pulls her up
they run like hell for the hatch into the darkness
a long beat then
a section of the pipe explodes debris rocketing in every direction
as the smoke clears we see a fifty yard section of pipe has been destroyed
on the consoles red concentric circles pulse outward from the point of impact emitting one monotone beep
the watchers are frozen stunned shocked
gabor a radio earpiece in his ear reports information
it wasnt nuclear
the bomb was a dud
the trigger charge blew out a fifty yard section of pipeline
an agonizing beat
the alarm beep sputters and dies
m and elektra share a look
do you think hes dead
m cant answer
she shakes her head
we just have to wait
the hi tech room is eerily lit by the pulsing red lights on every screen showing the explosion
to m i have a gift for you
something that belonged to my father
he would have wanted you to have it
m feels uneasy
perhaps this isnt the time
she hands m a small box
m unties the ribbon
he often spoke of how
compassionately you advised him on the best course of action during my kidnapping
m opens the box
it is the eye of the glens
the heirloom pin the original
its very valuable you know
i just couldnt let it explode with the rest of him
m looks up horrified when head
point blank cold blood
the men fall
m looks back at elektra a blood curdling glare
to her men take her to the chopper
from on high we follow the snaking pipeline
until it disappears in a vast smouldering bomb crater
beyond the pipeline continues unperturbed
two tiny figures on the banks of the crater
bond and christmas very much alive
what the hell were you doing
you nearly killed us
i did kill us
she thinks were dead
and she thinks she got away with it
what the hell are you talking about
its part of some plan
she dresses it up like a terrorist attack
the explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium
are you insane
this is her pipeline
makes her look even more innocent
skeptical what would she want with weapons grade plutonium
i was hoping you could tell me
christmas stares at him
you steal an old bomb small by todays standards about the size of the one that destroyed nagasaki take the plutonium core out of it intending to use it
beat to make a bigger better bomb
theyre both chilled by the thought
i have to get after that core
this is my ass
she starts fiddling with the radio
suddenly theres a tanner to do you read
bond grabs the radio
loud and clear
i have to speak to m
and two of our men have been killed
it impacts on bond
his eyes harden
what is it
she just upped the stakes
all her chips are on the table now
and ms life is part of the bet
he looks out at the long stretch of pipeline like a deadly snake with the world for its bed
i know i promised you champagne but would you settle for caviar
a boat puts in at an ancient tower in the middle of a vast body of water in fact the bosphorus
renard disembarks with several of his retinue heavily laden with bags and cases
they enter the tower
a fantastic space stained glass windows cast myriad patterns over elaborate tile and marble surfaces
pillars iron lattices velvet drapes and flowers embroider the huge room
as they enter elektra swoops across the floor and into renards arms
he holds her
she pushes him away
youre hurting me
he senses something different between them
she tries to hide it
brought me something
he smiles grabs a case off one of his men opens it up pulls out a sphere of cobalt blue metal
she looks at it with wary fascination
touch your destiny
she traces a finger along the metal
a flicker of wonder warm
pointed is it
shes sensitive to his buried frustration ive brought something for you as well
elektra opens a heavy door she and renard past through to
a small room
a window set in the stone on one side
the other side is divided off by a wall of bars creating a cell which now contains m the cell is bare except for a camp bed in the corner
m betrays no fear
a quiet defiance burns in her
just as i promised
renard steps forward
bars separate him from m
over praise im afraid
but my people will finish the job
your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me
you and my father
he didnt think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market
his kingdom he stole from my mother
the kingdom i will rightly take back
renard is left alone with m
is that what you did to her
im afraid it is what you did
he crosses close to the bars
when i took her she was
so clever so vibrant so
full of life force
and you left her there at the mercy of a man like me
you ruined her
to get to me
she is worth fifty of me
for once i agree with you
he shakes his head amused by her pluck
so she used all that brilliance to get revenge on her father on me
i wanted you
i wanted you for myself
he takes something out of his pocket
a small travel clock
he sets it
since you sent your man to kill me i have been watching time tick slowly away marching inevitably toward my own death
watch these hands m
at noon tomorrow your time is up
and i guarantee you
i will not miss
you will die
along with everyone in this city and the future of the west
he places the clock on a tall stool just out of reach through her bars
we hold on the clock eight p
valentin zukovsky in the back of his chauffeured rolls royce
we pull back to take in an amazing sight the car is on a network of raised walkways and platforms that extends as far as the eye can see
a decaying legacy of the soviet years
zukovsky limps purposefully away from his rolls along a walkway leading to a beluga fishery built over the water
nailed on the battered old door the lid of a caviar jar a label illustrated with a line drawing of zukovsky
zukovsky opens the door and finds himself
staring straight down bonds pistol
bond and christmas are silhouetted by the gold dusk light
at their feet lies one of zukovskys workers
what are doing bond
trying to impress this innocent thing
shes no innocent
this is my nuclear consultant
ah i see
hands held clear of his body zukovsky enters his evening dress decidedly out of place here
really bond couldnt you find a nice russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears
whats your business with elektra king
i thought you were the one in her business
she dropped a million and half dollars to the house your house
and you didnt even bat an eyelid
she was paying you off
as ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks
bond slams zukovsky hard against a vat of caviar
wood splits roe spills onto the floor
zukovsky is appalled
that is dollars of beluga ruined
you are out of your league
shes working with renard
christmas moves in intense but firm theyve stolen a nuclear device
a subtle change in zukovskys countenance
tell us what you know zukovsky
tell us before its too late
but it may be already the sound of a helicopter
zukovsky frowns the sound bond is the first to move as wood suddenly splinters everywhere the wall and roof tear open behind them giant vertically suspended saws rip through just
the blades churn through the corrugated roof spraying caviar everywhere
bond bursts out of the building
zukovsky and his guards and even the chauffeur are firing at the chopper
bond makes for his bmw running down a flight of steps onto a lower walkway when
the section ahead of him explodes
the second chopper above hitting its mark with a thrown grenade
bond is trapped by the fire and smoke the only way out is along the pipelines
he runs along a narrow section of pipe and then jumps down to another walkway
the pipes are now above him
the choppers relentless saws cut through the pipe
gas jets out
bond hurls himself up a stairway
zukovsky and christmas watch in horror as chopper one blades away more roof above them
bond takes something out of his pocket a remote control device
he presses some buttons
his car comes to life
lights on it drives toward him
he rushes to meet it
chopper two follows behind bond slicing up the walkway just behind him
bond gets to the car and jumps in as the chopper veers away
bond activates his missile device as he watches chopper two pass behind the factory
suddenly theres a huge roar behind him as the blades from chopper one rip through the roof but bond is undeterred
he sets off the missile toward the disappearing chopper one
a direct hit
chopper one explodes and falls onto the walkway setting the scene ablaze
zukovsky and christmas see the explosion then see chopper two dropped four armed men onto a nearby walkway
the men make their way toward the factory firing at the guards
zukovsky and christmas are forced inside
who sees the danger to the others and runs off along the walkways back to the factory
the chopper follows him shooting
bond outruns it until ahead of him a grenade explodes destroying the walkway and hurling bond into the water
the gunfight continues as the armed men take out zukovskys guards
then two of the assailants follow zukovsky and christmas into
the chauffeur is shot and killed
the gunmen then turn their attention to zukovsky and christmas when suddenly bond appears through a trap door in the floor boards
bond shoots one of the gunmen then fires on the other
zukovsky grabs christmas and they make their escape bond sees a third gunman firing from the basement and takes him out
zukovsky and christmas make a dash for zukovskys rolls
they dive in
zukovsky rams the car into reverse
behind him a chopper slices the walkway to smithereens
zukovsky cant stop it as the car leaps backward and into the water bond finishes off the remaining two armed men in a furious gunfight and exits
bond sees zukovsky and christmas swimming to safety
the chopper bears down on him
he leaps back to whats left of the building picks up a flare gun
he jumps down to a walkway at water level and cranks open a rusted gas jet
he then waits for the chopper to line up over it as it approaches bond for the kill
bond fires the flare gun
the chopper tries to pull away but its too late
the flames engulf it igniting a fireball
zukovsky pulls himself back onto a walkway and heads for the factory but speeding at him are to free flying saw blades from the chopper that has just exploded
omitted s to z zukovsky dives away into a caviar pit
the saws embed in the cabin behind him
the caviar pit is like sinking sand deep hes going under
flounders trying to cling to a crate blown in there by the explosion
then he looks in horror bond appearing at the edge of the caviar pit dragging himself up soaking wet
hes holding another harpoon gun
points it directly at zukovsky
this time he really means business
zukovsky on the point of being swallowed by the caviar clawing at the crate
bond steely eyed cold now
where were we
beat she thought i was dead those blades were meant for you
what do you know that she would kill you for
zukovsky is sinking
i dont know what youre talking zukovsky sees christmas appear beside bond help me dont let me drown
she looks to bond sees hes serious
to zukovsky youre in this thing up to your neck
zukovsky sinks alarmingly he talks rapidly staccato alright alright
sometimes i smuggle machinery for her
and the payoff on the tables
a special job
to haul some cargo
my nephew he is captain of a sub in the black sea fleet
wheres the sub going
get me out
this is too big for even you
where is it
this is a family matter
if my nephew is in danger we do it my way or nothing
now get me out
but he looks more worried than ever as bond takes aim with the harpoon gun squeezes the trigger
zukovsky yells as the harpoon shoots toward him
it takes him a moment to realize he hasnt been hit the harpoon splintering the crate just missing him
he clings to the crate exhausted as bond and christmas drag him to safety
commander bond you are dangerous unpredictable and a hothead
he just looks at her
but then again explosive devices are my specialty
zukovsky scowls wet angry looking from his ruined suit to the devastation that was once his caviar factory as behind him walkways creak teeter and crash into the sea
no mi no interpol
just you me and my people
beyond iron balustrades we see one of the most fabulous views in the world on one side the still waters of the golden horn on the other the dancing waves
of the unsheltered bosphorus and in between the tumbling roofs soaring minarets and crouching mosques of the pera district
renard scans the water with night vision binoculars
a supertanker churns along
the camera sinks beneath the waves steals through the gloom eventually comes upon something sitting just beneath the belly of the tanker
the silhouette of a submarine hugging the tankers shadow creeping undetected into the bosphorus
m paces her cell
looks out at the clock it is midnight
twelve hours to go
she crosses her arms
returns to pacing
puts her hands in her coat pockets she feels something
takes it out
the locator card
black and shiny with two copper terminals on one end
m taps it on her hand
she looks back out
to the clock
renard and elektra
she is on the bed renard stroking her worshipping her skin
so smooth so warm
how would you know
it stings him
elektra sits up pulling a robe around her
why are you like this
because bond is dead
its what you wanted
beat of course
renard gets up
paces the floor
he was a
what do you think
renard leans against her desk closing his eyes squeezing out the images
after a moment he smashes his fist through the hand painted wood
elektra looks up
a huge splinter of wood juts out of renards hand
renard looks at it curious unfazed
elektra comes to him
leads him to the bed
gently removes the splinter
then she takes an icecube from the bucket
runs it along his wound
what about this
and she runs the ice down his cheek
he shakes his head
now she runs the ice down her neck
her fingers becoming wet she runs the ice down between her breasts leaving a trail
you can feel this
shes moving the ice lower on herself
we see her lips open enjoying the sensation
a beat then his smile slowly grows
as she does something else
the calm before the storm except m is at the door of her cell
her arm is stretched out through the bars
she is using her high heeled shoe to try to hook the leg of the stool and drag it toward her
she can only jut tap the leg with the tip of the heel
she swipes out at the little three legged stool tapping it tapping it
it scoots toward her a little
she taps it again gets her shoe hooked on the leg of the stool and starts to drag it when
the rickety stool hits a bump on the ancient stone floor and spills over
the clock hits the ground and skids across the stones coming to rest across the room on the floor near the window
m leans against the bars
she hears her the outer door she hurries to her cot and lies down
a burly shadow in the light from the hall
he walks in
looks at m
picks up the clock and sets it on the he leaves shutting the door behind him
m sits up
looks out to the clock glowing in the dark
she drops her head back on the wall
she will not sleep tonight
establish the vast city astride the bosphorus
the sun starting to rise
street vendors are the only people about moving their carts into place getting ready to place out their wares
we hold on a building
a multi levelled rickety old building full of colourful fabrics drying high overhead the light shafts through them casting pools of different coloured light
it is a working factory bolts of fabric and vats of dye but it is also pushed to one end of the large room are stacks of radio equipment old
consoles audio equipment and radar screens
once a high tech surveillance center it has gone to seed
there are men and women here smoking using the equipment slightly dissolute very sinister where the only membership card is an old kgb id
zukovsky is here leaning behind a any luck reaching yevgeny
he moves to christmas and bond pouring over a large map of istanbul spread out on a table
to zukovsky what is this place
former kgb surveillance post
the dye factory was just a front now it turns a good profit
bond notices the boa in the corner with some others
your old friend dmitri
zukovsky nods to his old friend
today you are glad to have the boa on your side
zukovsky looks at the map
in the good old days the kgb had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing
but yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo
what class sub does your nephew run
not just nuclear
powered by a nuclear reactor
the penny drops hes not loading any cargo
they want the sub
the sub itself
put weapons grade plutonium inside the subs reactor instant catastrophic meltdown
made to look just like an accident
mother of god
the right kind of explosion in the right spot it would block the bosphorus cut off the black sea
eight million people would die the land irradiated for a hundred years
a cloud of radiation the size of europe
chilled because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines
there would be only one way to get the oil out of the caspian and pump it to the world
the king pipeline
elektra would control it all
if what you say it true
it may be too late for yevgeny
the ancient arched underbelly of a waterside building
something is disturbing a large expanse of water
a black shadow looms beneath the waves
a submarine surfaces
waiting at the newly excavated quay renard and his men
the submarines hatch opens
a youthful captain emerges vaguely resembling his uncle zukovsky
we are ready to load your cargo
we only have a few hours before well be missed
you came with a skeleton crew
thats all we can afford these days
we are grateful for your efforts
one of his men comes forward with several bottles of brandy and other food
we have brandy and other refreshments for your men
the captain nods pleased
bond and christmas and zukovsky watch as the radio operators scan the airwaves
if were not in time and something has happened to him
you must let me kill them
bond stares hard at him
a long beat
whoever gets there first zukovsky
they have m
eerie dark the lights inside green and sickly
a half eaten sandwich
an empty glass of brandy on the floor just near the hand it fell from
the dead face of yevgeny poisoned
others of his crew around also dead
renard and his men tour the grisly scene
take them up and throw them in the sea
as they drag yevgeny away his hat falls on the ground
renard picks it up and puts it on his head
well be underway in two hours
use that time to re familiarize yourselves with your stations
then ponder how rich youll be
the re breathers for the escape are already on board
a man appears holding a heavy lead box containing the plutonium
renard takes the box as if it weighs nothing
stronger then ever
elektra stands at the door looking in at m
now you know how it feels
to be locked away to wonder if theyre coming for you if anyone will ever come for you
someone will come
bond is dead
elektra walks to the window
she looks out
somehow i find that strangely disappointing
m watches her her heart beating
what time is it
elektra picks up the little clock
walks over to the cell bars
time for you to die
and she reaches through the bars and hands m the clock
the two womens eyes meet
the reactor is secured
she turns sees renard in the doorway
she crosses to him and slams the door shut behind her
their eyes lock
this is the end
it is the beginning
the world will never be the same
he lays the captains hat down
tries to mask his sorrow
it will be yours and yours alone
have fun with it
forces himself to leave heads down the stairs
m works quickly
she pops open the back of the clock and takes out the batteries
she pries off the tops with a key and connects the wires to the locator card
the radio operator touches his earpiece
comrade its faint but im getting something
he writes the coordinates down
bond picks them up
the locator card
he takes the coordinates over to the map and draws a corresponding line across it
christmas reads them out as the operator writes them down forty forty three degrees east
bond draws another line across the map
at the point at which the intersect
a small island in the bosphorus
the maidens tower
id heard there were some renovations there
no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years
suddenly bonds instinct are aroused
out of the corner of his eye he sees the boa set something on the ground and move slowly up the stairs
bond looks at the pack he left on the ground
he grabs christmas and hurls her to the floor
a massive explosion rips the place apart
in half a second the air is thick with coloured dust and drifting clumps of burning silk
christmas is stunned but okay
he looks around at the others few dead all out for the count among them zukovsky
bond heads for the door after the boa
if i dont get to the boa before he gets to maidens tower m is dead
bond runs out into teeming with people his eyes scanning he spots
the boa climbing a ladder alongside a building to a roof
bond chases after him clambering up but when he gets to the top of the roof
boa has now been joined by three thugs
one attacks bond as the boa and the others move away
bond fights with the thug they stumble across the roof gripping each other until bond gets the upper hand and throws him down through a thatched roof where he falls
into the market below
christmas just coming into the square sees the body falling
she runs to the thug thinking it might be bond
but the thug raises up smiling at her blood on his teeth
she turns and runs
the thug gives chase
bond is following boa and the other two men as they leap from roof to roof
he sees them jump off onto the roof of
motoring rapidly away from him
he makes a spectacular leap to a wobbly flag pole that swings him toward the bus dropping him on the roof before it snaps back into the overhead tram wires
above and setting off sparks
bond barely gets to his feet before thug is upon him
they grapple struggling to maintain their footing as the bus speeds through the rickety old streets
he throws the guy over
the thug desperately clings to the side of the bus
bond now takes on the third thug unaware that number two has climbed back on and is about to whack him on the head with his gun when
the bus turns onto a new street
the wires again
thug twos gun is caught up in them
he is instantly thug three watches his friends horrible death giving bond time to slug him hard across the face and throw him from the thug twos body goes slamming
into the windshield of a fast moving van
bursts out through the back doors of said van and tumbles out onto the street where it is hit by a car
bond turns back toward
now it is just the two of them
the bus is hissing to a stop
the boa leaps on to the bed of a passing truck
bond rushes forward and leaps on to the top of a passing taxi
the taxi jams on his breaks and bond rolls across the bonnet and on to the street
he springs to his feet
fifty yards ahead the truck carrying the boa has stopped for traffic
the boa jumps out and darts into an alley
the alley leads into a small cafe where patrons smoke water pipes and drink coffee
the boa is nowhere to be seen
bond slips out his gun holding it out of sight close to his leg so as not to alarm the civilians
he steps into the cafe
bond makes his way through the tables to the doorway in the back
he looks inside just a few children at play
bond is suddenly blind sided by a vicious kidney punch which brings him to his knees
he struggles to bring up his gun but the boa knocks it out of his hand
the boa locks bonds head in an unbreakable choke hold from behind
bond pulls on the massive arms but to no avail
he glances down to his right his gun just out of reach
bond reaches out for it his fingers just graze it
suddenly the boas foot kicks out knocking the gun across the room
he tighten his grip and speaks in bonds ear
for years i was told i could never take the great james bond and his walther ppk
what good is your gun now bond
bond cant breathe his eyes start to dim
he slumps forward his left hand touches something hot
its the iron basket of coals used to keep the water pipes lite
bonds fingers touch the wire handle that arches across the top
he grabs it and with his last reserves swings it at the back of his head hitting the boa on the side of the head with the sound of raw
bacon hitting a hot the boa drops bond and leaps to his feet holding the side of his face
bond falls forward fighting for breath and trying to clear his head
the boa runs out the back door
bond finds his gun holsters it and follows
bond comes out into a side street crowded with venders and shoppers
bond sees the boa pushing his way through the crowd to
russian tramp steamer taking on cargo
bond enters square in time to see the boa making a bee line for the russian steamer
as the boa much the worse for ware starts up the gangway to the top deck of the steamer bond hitches a ride on a cargo net that is being
hoisted aboard by the ships boom
boa breathing hard gets to the deck
he lumbers across it but before he can reach the other side he is tripped up by bond who has been waiting for him by the side of the deck
the boa goes sprawling
as bond comes for him he scrambles to his feet grabs a nearby bailing hook and swings at bond
but bond is ready for him
he wards off the blow with a small wooden cover from a shipping crate
he traps the boas arm and gives him two quick devastating kicks in the solar plexus
he boa stages back to the railing
a final kick from bond sends him over the side
bond looks down sees the boas body at a horrible angle his neck broken
bond sighs turns
gabor is there
gun trained on him
welcome aboard mr
a thug steps into sight below holding christmas hostage as well
a magnificent ornate tower in the centre of the bosphorus
an innocent looking launch coasts up to it
a tarp is raised and bond and christmas are revealed hands bound
they are helped out led inside by a number of henchmen
elektra crosses the hallway as the doors open
kisses bond on the cheek as she eyes christmas
james bond and his amazing resurrection
if only youd kept away we might have met again in a few years become lovers once more
christmas eyes bond anew as elektra leads him to an ornately carved chair covered in silk
to guards take her to renard
bond and christmas exchange a look as the guards start her towards some steps
elektra indicates for him to sit
behind him the whole of istanbul is visible through a large curved window
you had her too
bond ignores her
i could have given you the world
she casually reaches behind his neck flips up a wooden arm to which is attached a metal collar
they were digging near here and they found some very pretty vases
they also found this
meaning the garotte i think we ignore the old ways at our peril dont you
bond recoils as she fastens the collar
she steps back
ignoring her wheres m
soon shell be everywhere
bond keeps his cool all this because you fell for renard
five more turns and your neck will break
she moves to the back of the chair twists the screw one notch
the effect on bond is instantaneous as a bolt jolts into the back of his neck tilts his head back
since i was a child ive always had a power over men
when i realized my father wouldnt rescue me from the kidnappers i knew i had to form a new alliance
realizing you turned renard
smiling just like you
only you were even easier
she pulls the jewel from her ear reveals the ugly scar i told him he had to hurt me he had to make it look real
when he refused i told him i would do it myself
she turns the screw again
so you killed your father
he killed me
he killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom
a flicker of emotion
bond is getting to her
was this all about the oil
it is my oil
mine and my familys
her eyes are shining
she moves toward the view gazing out at this spectacular cradle of civilization
bond works his wristbinds feverishly
it runs in my veins thicker than blood
im going to redraw the map
and when i am through the whole world will know my name my grandfathers name the glory of my people
no one will believe this melt down was an accident
she eyes him impressed that hes worked out her plan
tightens the screw again
her confidence amazing
they will believe
they will all believe
tightening the screw again you understand
nobody can resist me
now she straddles him
she puts the jewel back on her ear
all the time hes working that wristbind
know what happens when a man is strangled
elektra its not too late
eight million people neednt die
she smiles twists the screw again
a nasty grinding sound
sweat trickles from his brow
she licks it away
you should have killed me when you had the chance
but you couldnt
a woman youve loved
she pushes her hips into his
turns the screw
the bolt is jammed right into the back of his neck
his face is angled upwards
breathing is difficult
he glares up you meant
she fingers the bolt
prepares to turn it the last time
his hand strains at its binding
kissing his ear oh james
she begins to turn the screw
when several gunshots are heard outside
bond is on the edge of consciousness
gets off him
moves to a window
big battered and bloody valentin zukovsky is leaving a boat moving over the rocks toward the entrance with three of his men
two bodies in his trail
hes on course for elektra and nothing is going to stop him even as his henchmen are cut down by ferocious fire
elektra moves to her gun
just then gabor crashes through a stained glass window neck broken
two elektra henchmen appear from below stairs as the doors burst open
zukovsky stands there
a bloody giant
they open up with machine guns but two shots from zukovsky take them out though he takes one in the shoulder
right now hes unstoppable
a shocked silence after the shooting
he eyes bond in the chair
to the room im looking for a submarine
its big and black and the driver is a friend of mine
then his eye falls on the hat renard had brought up from below
he knows at once what it means
bring it to me
she picks it up walks to him surreptitiously sliding a gun beneath it
she proffers the hat
what a shame
you just missed him
blam blam blam she fires through the hat
he staggers back
lowers his head to the ground
she walks over puts her heel on his gun arm presses down smiling a half psychotic smile
the gun is pinned
zukovsky is dying
but he dredges up every last ounce of energy to raise his gun a millimetre off the ground his outstretched arm already pointing at bond
elektra looks surprised then amused as zukovskys finger begins to squeeze the trigger hes going to shoot bond
bond stares back
zukovskys eye narrows trying for extreme accuracy
the shot hits the binding at bonds wrist
splinters the wood there
elektra stares at zukovsky
she didnt see where the bullet went just that it missed bond
she watches his head slump further staring at bond
a look passes between the two men
comrades in arms
the merest of smiles
then the light fades from his eyes
turns back to bond
she picks up a walkie talkie speaks into it everythings under control up here
are you ready
lost for a moment she breathes heavily
she glances at zukovskys corpse
slightly puzzled to bond zukovsky really hated you
beat time to say goodnight
and she kisses him reaches behind to deliver the killer twist
one super fast movement bonds hand breaks free grabs her throat tight
he holds her their faces close together disdain in his eyes hurls her backwards her hand scratching at his face
ripping the collar from his neck he gets to his feet
moves to zukovsky checks his pulse takes the bloody gun from his fingers
turns back to see elektra disappearing upstairs
a moments dilemma should he race below to the sub or up to elektra
he takes off after elektra grabs the radio handset
the submarines engines roar to life
elektra rises up one of the triple spiral stairways leading to the various balconies of the minaret tower
bond stalks up after her
their voices echo through the intertwined stairs james
you cant kill me
not in cold blood
but bond isnt wavering
clutches zukovskys bloody wet gun
he heads up in the semi darkness and suddenly swings to his right at an unexpected but familiar voice bond bond kicks open a door and enters
he fires at the lock on her cell door and frees her
turns to go heading upward after elektra
go after the submarine forget the girl
elektra has reached a balcony
it affords a spectacular view of istanbul
bond appears has her cornered
call him off
he holds the walkie talkie to her mouth
i wont ask again
call him off
she looks at him seriously
hes giving her a last chance willing her to save herself and the city
into walkie talkie renard
to bond you wouldnt kill me
youd miss me
and her face breaks into a perverted grin and into walkie talkie dive
bond shoots her
she staggers back shocked at her own mortality
i never miss
he looks out sees the nose of the sub heading into the bosphorus half submerged
the hatch is still open
he stares at her dead body a beat
and then he crouches
he touches her cheek just once before he goes
behind him unbeknownst m has seen it all
he moves to the ledge
composes himself and dives one hundred feet to the water
he surfaces close to the exiting sub
grabs a ladder pulls himself up
the hatch is closing
he splashes through the water flooding over the sub appears in front of the amazed sailor shutting the hatch
whacks him with the hatch
milliseconds before the hatch slides under the water
bond down below
renards crew are spread throughout the sub
he creeps through
approaches one man working some levers smoking
bond holds his gun to his head
how do you want to die
re cigarette that
re gun or this
a few solid bangs on the metal of christmas door
it opens and bond lets the now unconscious man hit the deck
that was his head banging
he takes her by the hand they move through the shadows of the sub
a man is operating the tanks
through the intercom filtered flood tanks and
the man does as told
when hes finished bond knocks him out with the butt of his gun
several men occupy the central control room renard at their centre
beyond on the other side the outer chamber of the reactor
from the other end of the control room bond and christmas so near and yet so far they cant get to the reactor because there are so many men in
keeping behind cover is there another way
we go down to the torpedo bay
bond and christmas get attacked
a vicious silent fight
then the radio set sparks into life open the tanks
bond is throttling the man with the cable
speaks into the handset
disguising voice tanks open
but the man has stretched his hand to a fire alarm the klaxon resounds
renard looks up
to self bond
he flicks a switch into mic bond
you have decided to join me on this historic voyage
welcome to my nuclear family
his voice fills the control room
youre really going to commit suicide for her
renard responds into the microphone
in case youve forgotten
im dead already
havent you heard the news
so is she
renards face screws up in pain more searing than any he could feel in his skin
the scream like a wounded animal echoes throughout the doomed craft
back on renard gasping spent
you will die for this
he strides through to the jams shut the hatch behind him
now moves through to the where he picks up the plutonium
moves back into the sealing the other door behind him
and now he opens up the cover of the glaring reactor
christmas sees a panel light up the cover is off the reactor
bond reads off more lights
hes sealed himself in
hes going to insert the plutonium
thinking fast bond moves to some controls
do you know what youre doing
like riding a bike
the air tanks immediately filling with water
christmas and bond shift to the side
everything not screwed down starts sliding
the submarine is tilting further and further the nose dropping down and down
pretty soon we have the strange and incredible sight of a submarine hanging vertically nose down
renard hangs on swings until he can get a footing on the nearest wall
bond and christmas hang on too get a grip
he helps her up
what kind of bikes did you ride
just wanted to put him on edge
renard is disturbed by the subs position but only momentarily
he moves to an intercom open the torpedo tubes
bond hears a creak turns to see the tubes open water gushes up toward them at an incredible rate
he pulls christmas up and they ascend to the next level
no chance to seal the chamber though the water is already through the hatch
renard now struggles back up to the reactor stares into the violet blue heat
he hits a button
a rod slowly rises out of the reactor
bond and christmas are ahead of the water
they have reached a level where various systems are operated from
theres one chance
he punches buttons
high up on the sub a hatch opens
water floods into an escape hatch
an inner door stops it getting into the submarine itself
renard slowly inserts the plutonium rod
immediately the light around him becomes a deeper blue a horrible luminescence
the staccato click of a distant geiger counter intensifies
as bond opens the inner door of an escape hatch he points out a cabinet on the wall to christmas
she opens the box to find the re breathers are ripped to shreds
no one was ever meant to get off the sub
she shows bond
never liked those things anyway
he climbs into the escape chamber
count to twenty
when you get to twenty open the hatch
it can only be opened for a few seconds or well sink
but what if
count to twenty
ill be there
she moves over and seals the door wrenches a lever which immediately floods the chamber with water
inside the chamber bond holds his breath as water seeps in
the most claustrophobic thing youve ever seen
a green light comes on and christmas punches a button
the outer door opens
bond burst out and starts the long swim up the outside of the submarine
christmas is counting
one one thousand two one thousand
its dark out here
it would be very easy for bond to get disoriented
he peers around trying to get his bearings against the vast vertical whale hes swimming up
passes the conning tower
fourteen one thousand fifteen one thousand
bond is running out of air
and then he sees it the open hatch of the rear escape door
he gets inside yanks it closed
christmas shivering in the rising water
she presses a button
the hatch opens and bond collapses out in a gush of water
the hatch closes
the whole world is at a crazy angle here
bond looks down at the sealed door of the reactor chamber curses
bathed in the horrible light of the over heating reactor renard looks upwards aware of sounds on the other side of the door
the door shoots off its hinge blasted by bond
bond drops down into the chamber takes one look at renard now a crumpled heap in the corner
bond moves down to the next door opens it christmas
and there she is struggling the water level way below still rising
he lowers an arm pulls her up
they clamber up to the reactor bonds pov in the intense glow inside the overheating rod protruding slightly
we have to get the rod out of the reactor
bond looks at the gauges from behind a thick glass shield
christmas comes up level with him melting down
degrees the zirconium casings on the rods crack
the plutonium melts
in ten minutes a hydrogen explosion
he starts toward the reactor when suddenly christmas grabs at him is flung back nearly falls through the hatch but manages to grab a pipe hangs on for dear life
both slamming into switches and buttons
he looks down the sub more water racing upward
back to the pile
scans the scene searching for an idea
sees a hose compressed air escaping from a fissure
grabs the hose snaps it free
is recovering has found a flare gun near him
raises it to bond
in the reflection of the gauge which is millimeters from we see renard approaching from behind us
bond jams the hose into the reactor ducks down as the air blows the rod out narrowly missing him as it shoots past impales renard in the heart just before
he could shoot
renard stares at bond in horror
bond calmly takes the flare gun off him
shes waiting for you
and he lets him fall past christmas through consecutive open hatches of the sub crashing into the rising water
christmas looks down at the floating corpse
bond watches the gauge as it edges down from
the nuclear disaster looks like its averted
but suddenly water is gushing in from above through splits in the subs shell its going to sink
but she wont come
as water courses over them help me
we have to seal it
she moves to the reactor closing the cover
bond uses his strength to push the heavy locking mechanism into place
bond climbs upwards dragging christmas with him
weve got to get out
they clamber into the next chamber up
the submarine is slowly sinking nose down
air is escaping from the many seams that are creeping apart
we can hear the metallic groans through the water
bond and christmas crawl into torpedo chambers
bond reaches out setting a timer to fire
the clock ticks down
the torpedo doors open and bond and christmas are shot out into the water streaking through as behind them
the submarine explodes in spectacular fashion
bond and christmas reach the surface
look around them
no boats coming to the rescue
they wave to a tourist boat passing
the boat heads over to pick them up
the damaged wing is being repaired
tanner overseeing things and then
m walks in
efficient and steely as ever
all eyes turn to her
she looks at everyone
makes the briefest of nods
that is all the sentiment allowed as business resumes
she scans the machines any word from him
still no contact yet
a magnificent rooftop garden looking out over istanbul
christmas and bond alone with some bollinger
fireworks explode above
they clink glasses
he looks out at the cityscape
i love christmas in turkey
so isnt it time you unwrapped your present
tanner and q look at a satellite thermal image of istanbul
the satellite image zooms in one particular car parked in a side street
we can just make out bonds aston martin
he must be nearby
m comes over
the image moves from the car closes on the garden rooftop
the thermal image is multi coloured difficult to decipher
this picks up body heat
humans should be orange
and he points to one orange figure lying on the rooftop
to tanner i thought you said he was with doctor jones
they all look back to the image
the figure is turning red almost glowing
its getting redder
tanner q and m realize as one that this is an image of two people one atop the other
and getting hotter
q switches the screen off clears his throat
could be a premature form of the millennium bug
its dark we cant really see them
you know james
i think christmas is coming early this year
