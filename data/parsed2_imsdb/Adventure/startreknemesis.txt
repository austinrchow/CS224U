glorious in its many forms
the biological pulse finding its way heroically through the cold manipulation of science
credits as we see a beautiful montage of futuristic medical technology
through a microscope we see cells multiplying and gene strands exponentially increasing with the vibrancy of exploding flowers
we see laser splicing and biological manipulation on the molecular level
credits continue as we fade to
in a cavernous shadowy chamber
dark figures lean together and talk seriously
their hushed urgent tones denote the gravity of their discussion
we cant make out the words but there is no doubt what they are talking about
the three year old human boy who stands before them
the boy is alone and frightened lost in the sweeping grandeur of the massive chamber
credits continue as we fade to
on a stark desert planet with monolithic mountains and harsh crags shooting upward
the only light in this dark netherworld comes from the flames that accompany the hellish mining operations everywhere around us
the human boy gazes over this desolate vista and then he looks up for a moment
at the stars
then a tall figure leads him firmly into one of the mines
the boy seems to disappear into this flaming crucible
credits end as we go to
the sun is setting on the capital city of the great romulan star empire the imperial monoliths and martial towers of this bustling city glow red as the sun dips
below the horizon
we slowly move down toward the most imposing building of the city
the romulan senate chamber
senator talaura watches the proceedings with a studied look of bored indifference
she glances to the familiar romulan crest that dominates one wall of the chamber a ferocious bird of prey holding two planets one in either claw
and then her eyes carefully cross the chamber to
praetor hiren the head of the romulan government presiding over the senate from a throne like chair
he is a capable politician in his s
but if we hesitate well lose this important source of dilithium
a trade agreement is in the best interests of the empire
praetor i recommend we dispatch a diplomatic mission to celes ii to open negotiations
senator talaura grunts slightly at the word negotiations
praetor hiren glances to her
senator talaura you disagree with the motion
i would say negotiation is to be advised
i support all diplomatic overtures
but if you will excuse me praetor i have an appointment with the tholian ambassador
the praetor nods
talaura stands and leaves the chamber
but she had left something behind on her desk
a small silver box with unusual etchings on the surface
the discussion continues as we focus on the silver box
then i will call for a vote on the motion to open trade negotiations with celes ii
the senator at the desk next to talauras glances over
the silver box is moving
the senator watches amazed as the box begins to slowly fold open
then legs appear
the box unfolds like a spider standing on its legs
then it is still for a moment
the senator looks at it puzzled
suddenly a bright beam of green light shoots up from the spider the senators are stunned the beam shoots to the high domed ceiling of the chamber and then cascades
around the interior of the room enveloping everything in a glowing shroud of green energy
in a way it is bizarrely beautiful
and then just as suddenly the light disappears
a moment of silence
the praetor and senators are baffled
would someone please tell me what that was
he turns to a guard alert security a plant behind the praetor begins to shrivel
and have them run a the praetor stops suddenly as the flesh begins to melt from his face
every bit of organic matter in the chamber decays
flesh melts from bones while the senators scream in agony
every living thing in the chamber is dead within ten seconds
a stunning moment of silence as we take in the carnage
then a transporter effect ripples around the spider weapon
and the romulan senate is no more
we fade to
jean luc picard the most beloved and respected captain in starfleet
his face is resolute and set
his white dress uniform is buttoned tightly to the neck
he looks at us evenly and then utters the word that has been the watch cry for his entire life as a starfleet officer
he lets the word resonate and then continues
a starship captains life is filled with solemn duty
i have commanded men in battle
i have negotiated peace treaties between implacable enemies
i have represented the federation in first contact with twenty seven alien species
but none of this compares to my solemn duty as
we pull back to reveal the wedding reception of will riker and deanna troi
the enterprise crew is gathered with invited guests some from other star trek series
riker and deanna sit at the center of a long table
now i know that on an occasion such as this it is expected that i be gracious and fulsome with praise on the wonders of this blessed union
but have you two considered what youre doing to
this is all a damned inconvenience
laughter from the crowd while youre happily settling in on the titan ill have to train a new first officer no doubt a stern martinet wholl quote the rule book
at me and never
allow me to go on away missions
laughter then theres the matter of my new counselor
undoubtedly some soft spoken willowy thing wholl be probing into my darkest psyche as she nods her head and coos sympathetically
isnt that right deanna
deanna nods her head and coos sympathetically
hearty wonderful laughter
i notice dr
crusher laughing along with the rest of you
as most of you know the doctor will also soon be leaving the enterprise to assume command of starfleet medical
again im forced to ask beverly have you considered what youre doing to little ole me
ill probably get some old battle axe of a doctor wholl tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if i dont show up for my physical
itll serve you right
laughter laughter laughter
he looks to riker and deanna really its not too late to reconsider
very well then
he smiles and raises his glass looks at them deeply
will riker you have been my trusted right arm for fourteen years you have helped keep my course true and steady
deanna troi you have been my conscience and best guide the touchstone to the better parts of myself
you are my family
and in proper maritime tradition i wish you full sails and a clear horizon
my friends make it so
the party guests mingle as a band plays
we are at a beautiful open air pavilion high in the denali mountains
the soaring ranges of rikers native alaska can be seen everywhere around us
beverly crusher goes to picard
playfully sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath isnt it
please beverly this is hard enough
if you start tearing up i promise to beam you out
level one medical emergency
theres no crying in starfleet
they head off toward riker and deanna
meanwhile geordi la forge sits with his girlfriend
ive never seen your captain so nostalgic
maybe hes getting soft in his old age
laughs not likely
after we installed the new series four replicators he tried to order his usual tea and there was a glitch
had us remove the whole bunch of them and put the old ones back in
nostalgic about old replicators
he just likes things the way he likes them
he looks at her smiles of course so do i
he kisses her gently as worf comes to them
poor worf is still suffering a bit from the bachelor party
he plops down beside them belches
romulan ale should be illegal
it is old chum
then it should be more illegal
he groans and rests his head on the table acts like hes going to heave
meanwhile riker and deanna are talking to picard and beverly
really captain it was a lovely toast
the least i could do for you deanna
besides you know me
im a talking head
and you neednt worry
ill brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know
the hell you will
you know too much about me as it is
now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on betazed
no no speeches
no clothes either
winks mischievously picard looks at him
then the band stops playing
data stands with the band
ladies and gentlemen and invited tran gendered species
in my study of terran and betazoid conjugal rites i have discovered it is traditional to present the happy couple with a gift
given commander rikers affection for archaic musical forms i have elected to present the following as my gift in honor of their conjugation
riker shoots an amused glance to deanna
data turns to the band leader
if you please mister band leader a one and a two and
the band launches into a jaunty swing version of the irving berlin standard blue skies
sings blue skies smiling at me nothing but blue skies do i see
blue birds singing a song nothing but blue birds all day long
never saw the sun shining so bright never saw things going so right
the crowd is appreciative
loves the song
except worf he momentarily raises his head from the table
his heads thumps down again is about ready to barf
meanwhile riker is anxious as a kid to join the band smiles all right go ahead
riker eagerly joins the band
grabs the trombone and starts jamming with the orchestra
the song really swings
to deanna may i have this dance
with pleasure captain
meanwhile geordi leads leah to the dance floor as well
beverly goes to worf
do klingons swing
i am not a swinger
i am unwell
dont worry im a doctor
she pulls him to the dance floor as im so glad you made it back to the enterprise before i left
i was not suited for the life of a
wry whod have guessed
picard and deanna sweep past them
and we pull up and away as data continues to sing and the crew dances
it is a joyous celebration of these people
a family we love
the enterprise streaks through space
data sits in the empty crew lounge
as always the androids placid neutral expression still somehow manages to convey his wonder curiosity and idiosyncratic zest for life
picard arrives with a very old bottle of wine
ive been saving this
batten down the hatches
he carefully uncorks the treasured bottle as they say a vintners history is in every glass
the soil he came from
his past as well as his hopes for the future
he pours two glasses of the wine then raises his glass a toast
to happy endings
to happy endings
picard carefully takes a tiny sip savors the flavor finally swallows
data mimics picard
taking a tiny sip savoring the flavor and finally swallowing
i noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding
i am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse laughter through tears but i could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both
pleasure and sadness simultaneously
i understand why it would seem confusing
certain human rituals like weddings birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions
these rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time
and you were particularly aware of this feeling because commander riker will be leaving to assume command of the titan
will and deanna joining the titan
crusher going to starfleet medical
and this makes you sad
i suppose it does a bit
im very happy for them of course but im going to miss them
the ship will seem
incomplete without them
that is because you have a familiarity with them
you can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge
and frankly i envy them as well
theyve made important choices theyre going to have great challenges ahead of them
new worlds to conquer
he takes another sip of wine
seeing will and deanna today made me think about some of the choices ive made in my own life
devoting myself to starfleet
not marrying or having children
all the choices that led me here
data thinks about it
the choices i made have led me here as well
this is the only home i have ever known
i cannot foresee a reason for leaving
you never know whats over the horizon data
before too long youll be offered a command of your own
data looks at him he has never really considered this
if i were
i believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior
i would miss you
smiles now you make a toast
to new worlds
yes data brave new worlds
flickering braziers dimly illuminate the cold martial splendor of a senate corridor
commander donatra and commander suran stride through the corridor
suran is an elder romulan officer respected and tenacious
donatra a key figure in this story so pay close attention to her is a mature beautiful woman
not without a dry sense of humor
the fleet commanders are nervous
theyve agreed to remain at their given coordinates and await his orders
but theyre anxious to know whats going on here
i dont blame them
we cant keep them in the dark forever
a voice from the shadows but in darkness there is strength
donatra and suran stop
and the viceroy steps from the shadows
he is a terrifying sight a powerful monstrous alien creature a tall ashen skinned ectomorph who bears a disturbing resemblance to the original nosferatu
he is vampiric and lethal
he is a reman
dont you agree
he leads them along the corridor
we observe the romulan crest an imposing bird of prey clutching a planet in either claw not unlike the kaos emblem from get smart that dominates a wall
as we hear consider it the great symbol of the empire
but the bird of prey holds planets
their destinies conjoined
and then we see him
he is a dynamic young human in his twenties
very handsome with pale almost white skin and shining golden hair
he wears a striking reman military uniform
he stands in the center of the eerily deserted chamber
the entire floor is a large star chart
yet for generations one of those planets has been without a voice
we will be silent no longer
senator talaura the female senator who planted the weapon in the senate chamber earlier and two other romulan commanders sit
cadres of shinzons fearsome reman warriors stand around the chamber
they are his sinister children of the night
even more chilling now in the flickering torch light
its like something out of tim burton
donatra and suran enter the chamber with shinzons viceroy
join us commanders
now whats the disposition of the fleet
theyre holding position
bows his head they will obey praetor
its imperative we retain their allegiance or our great mission will be strangled before it can truly draw breath
they support your intentions sir
but they require evidence of your
shinzon looks at her
a quick beat
shinzon decides to respond with benevolence
and theyll have it
he begins to pace over the star chart tell the fleet that the days of negotiation and diplomacy are over
the almighty federation will fall before us
as i promised you
he stands on the area of the map that denotes the neutral zone between the romulan empire and the federation
the time we have dreamed of is at hand
sinister laugh he carefully steps into the area of the map marked with the federation symbol
he looks down at the star chart
cut off the dragons head and it cannot strike back
donatra watches him carefully
something in his quiet words disturbs her
how many warbirds will you need
they look at him stunned
you have the whole fleet at your disposal
they supported the coup theyll follow you
the scimitar will serve my needs
but surely i came this far alone
he looks at his reman warriors we came this far alone
we require no assistance from the fleet
now leave me to my thoughts
the commanders and senator talaura rise and leave
shinzon looks to his viceroy
are we prepared
so many years for this moment
he looks up at his viceroy smiles bring him to me
the bridge crew are at their stations
picard is not on the bridge
grumbles i wont do it
its tradition worf
you of all people should appreciate that
whispers besides ive already seen it
a warrior does not appear without his clothing
it leaves him
i dont think were going to see much combat on betazed
dont be too sure
mother will be there
picard emerges from his ready room as i wont do it
wont do what mister worf
i think it is inappropriate for a starfleet officer to appear
hates the word naked
come now a big strapping fellow like you
what are you afraid of
then a readout on worfs console attracts his attention im picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the kolarin system
what sort of signature
worf looks up
glances at data
geordi is at the engineering station with picard riker and data
its very faint but ive isolated it to the third planet in the kolarin system
what do we know about the planet
well have to get closer for a more detailed scan
to data theories
since positronic signatures have only been known to emanate from androids such as myself it is logical to theorize that there is an android such as myself on kolarus iii
how many of you did dr
i thought only me myself and lore
looking at star chart diverting to the kolarin system takes us awfully close to the romulan neutral zone
looking at star chart still well on our side
picard glances at data recognizes the androids deep desire to explore this possible connection to others like himself
i think its worth a look
dont worry number one well get you to betazed with time to spare
thank you sir
to all especially worf where we will all honor the betazoid traditions
no cold feet or any other parts of our anatomy
now if youll excuse me
ill be in the gym
to helm officer mister branson set course for the kolarin system
warp five deanna shoots him a glance warp seven
plotted and laid in sir
you better believe youre engaged
meanwhile geordi and data remain at the engineering station studying the displays
what do you think data a long lost relative
data doesnt respond but the curiosity on his face is apparent
the enterprise is in orbit around the uncharted planet
in the distance we can see the distorting violence of an ion storm
kolarus iii is on the viewscreen the ion storm raging beyond it
i read six distinct positronic signatures spread out over a few kilometers on the surface
what do we know about the population
isolated pockets of humanoids
it appears to be a pre warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development
captain i dont recommend transporting that ion storm doesnt look very neighborly
it could head this way without much warning
data worf youre with me
picard data and worf start heading toward the turbolift
stands protesting captain i hope i dont have to remind you i appreciate your concern number one but ive been itching to try out the argo
sir captains prerogative will
theres no foreseeable danger
and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you
he steps into the turbolift with the data and worf
you have the bridge mister troi
the turbolift doors slide shut
the bridge crew heartily enjoys rikers momentary demotion to house husband
the shuttlebay doors slide open and the transport vehicle argo emerges
the argo is larger than a regular shuttle with a particularly large cargo area at the back
the argo lands on the planet
it is primarily a desert environment with some canyons and mountains
like death valley blazing heat waves shimmer in the distance
the shuttle sits silently for a moment
we wonder at the delay then
the rear cargo doors slide open and picard data and worf roar out on a th century equivalent of a military jeep
picard drives data beside him
worf stands in the back at a mounted phaser canon
it is a muscular exciting vehicle a starfleet version of the jeep from old television series the rat patrol
picard screeches to a stop
data and worf lurch
a cloud of dust momentarily obscures them
data quickly monitors the positronic signatures with a tricorder the closest signature is two kilometers to the west
that direction sir
thank you data
he smiles lets see what she can do
he roars off in a cloud of dust
picard clearly enjoys driving
he roars over the desert terrain at breakneck speed having a hell of a good time
his comrades dont exactly appreciate his free spirited driving panache
worf clings on to the mounted phaser canon for dear life
data steadies himself by grasping onto the rollbar i will always be baffled by the human predilection for piloting vehicles at unsafe velocities
picard smiles and drives a little faster
monitoring with tricorder over that rise sir
half a kilometer
they continue on
before long they can see something on the level desert floor before them
they approach and stop to discover
an android arm
the fingers patiently drumming the ground
it appears to be
he scans with his tricorder an arm
suspicious why is it moving
like me it has been designed with modular power sources
mister worf if you please
worf climbs from the jeep and carefully approaches the arm
gingerly picks it up
the arm responds to being picked up the hand starts feeling around in the air like something from a horror movie
he returns to the jeep
quickly sets the arm down in the rear cargo area
the next signature is one kilometer to the south
picard starts the jeep in motion
time passes as they continue on
coming across another arm
various disassembled components of a data like android
worf stands uneasily amidst the moving body parts
there is only one component missing the head
picard steers the jeep into a canyon
data scans with his tricorder pointing it up into the gently sloping hills that form the sides of the canyon
the final signature is approximately meters up that incline
mister worf accompany data please
uneasy to find the head sir
amused if you dont mind
worf and data climb up into the hills in pursuit of the final piece as picard opens the jeeps hood and checks the engine
worf and data climb as data scans and indicates the direction ten meters
worf pulls his phaser ready
i think it unlikely you will need your phaser to recover the cranial unit
of course it could bite you
then they see it
or the spitting image anyway
lying inert in the dust before them
the resemblance is
then the heads eyes suddenly pop open
it looks up at them with a sort of blank childlike wonder
why am i looking at me
you are not looking at yourself
you are looking at me
looking at worf you do not look like me
to head i would like to pick you up now
may i do that
to worf you have a pretty shirt
data gently picks up the head
looks at it
the two identical faces gaze at each other
a boulder near them explodes
worf and data spin to see
a nomadic tribe of desert aliens swarming toward them firing primitive plasma weapons data and worf race back down the canyon toward the jeep some open field running and a
bit of phaser action worf firing to distract and slow the aliens not kill them through all of this the head is chattering away blandly i have two arms and ten fingers
do you know where my arms are
i cannot see where we are going
where are we going
like threepio in empire when hes strapped to chewbaccas back
the action continues
then data finds himself almost surrounded commander
worf turns data throws the head to worf like a football a perfect spiral the head is still chattering away worf catches it the head abruptly stops talking
data hands free now quickly incapacitates the aliens around him with a dazzling demonstration of his superior strength and agility
meanwhile worf tucks the head under his arm and sprints like a master running back evading aliens and occasionally firing his phaser they are closer to the jeep now but
they are in trouble the swarm of aliens almost overtaking them
when a thundering blast sends up a shower of debris stopping the aliens picard is standing in the rear of the jeep firing the phaser canon
data and worf climb into the jeep as picard leaps into the front seat and roars off worf standing at the phaser canon quickly hands the head to data in
the front seat if you wouldnt mind
the head looks up at picard
you have a shiny head
picard glances at the head
he is very observant
i can see that
picard turns to see that they are being pursued
the aliens are racing after them in crude desert terrain vehicles to data shall we try some unsafe velocities
he floors it racing across the desert landscape
worf fires the mounted phaser canon blasting away at the aliens not killing them just stopping them a few dramatic crashes as the alien vehicles overturn meanwhile to picard you
have a red shirt
to head this is not an appropriate time for a conversation
because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle
they continue to speed over the landscape bouncing and flying over natural rises in the terrain trying to evade their pursuers picard puts the pedal to the metal and races
through the alien vehicles weaving in and out avoiding their fire worf blasts away with the phaser cannon an exhilarating adventure finally they are within sight of the argo but they see it is surrounded by more of the aliens
lets make like the wind
data punches some buttons on a dashboard console and the argo lifts off by remote control data uses the console to swing the argo around and lower the rear cargo
doors it hovers over the surface picard floors the jeep using a natural rise in the terrain as a ramp the jeep flies through the air over the aliens and into the cargo bay picard slams on the brakes the jeep screeches to a stop as the doors shut and the argo shoots into the air
picard climbs from the jeep
he nonchalantly rubs a bit of dirt from the hood and then disappears into the main cabin
data and worf remain in the jeep for a beat stunned
smiles he must have klingon blood
beverly gazes at the android head
it gazes back at her
i think you have nicer eyes
we pull back to reveal she is speaking to data
data stands with picard riker and geordi
our eyes are identical doctor
the android is in a framework rig that holds the various body parts in place
the parts are not yet assembled geordi
at work analyzing the torso section well he seems to have the same internal mechanics as data but not as much positronic development
the neural pathways arent nearly as sophisticated
id say hes a prototype
soong created before data
to head do you have a name sir
i am the b
soongs penchant for whimsical names seems to have no end
to riker you have a fuzzy face
trying to ignore the head keep me informed number one and please put him back together
geordi and data begin to reassemble the b piece by piece like the tin man as can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we
blandly i was taken from my homeworld by people called the pakjeds
they are fat
they traded me to a ship belonging to the bolians
the bolians are blue
they put me in a seat and asked me questions
then they were attacked by another ship
and still the b is yammering blandly away
he is more fully assembled by this time beverly is thoroughly bored
then people called the delviciansans picked me up
they have long teeth
they asked if i do anything to help them
i told them i could do whatever they wanted
they asked me to clean out the matrix manifolds
i told them i did not know what an matrix manifold looks like
i have some diagnostics to run on some medical scanner things
she quickly exits
and after they showed me the engine manifolds
then they showed me something called a plasma mop time passes
and still the b is yammering away
he is almost completely assembled by now
riker is bored out of his mind
then the cardassians put me into something called a garbage chute and i went out into space again worf to commander riker
i have the tactical manifests ready sir
quickly tapping his comm badge worf
ill be right there
he stands duty calls gentlemen
fuzzy face is gone
yes please continue
i was in space for a long time
then a ship belonging to the talosians picked me up
they asked me where i came from
i told them people called the pakleds took me from my homeworld
they are fat
and still the b is yammering away
by this time geordi is slumped in a chair and only data is listening
the b is fully assembled
then i opened my eyes and saw you
the b is finally done with his tale
do you know who i am
you are me
my name is data
i am your brother
riker and deanna are having dinner with worf
to worf and after the ceremony on betazed three entire weeks for our honeymoon
were going sailing on the opal sea
weve booked an old fashioned solar catamaran
just us and the sun and the waves
it seems a very
amused its meant to be relaxing
a klingon honeymoon begins with the kholamar desert march where the couple bonds in endurance trials
if they survive the challenge they move on to the fire caves of feklhr to face the demons of grethor
well that sounds relaxing too
they see data enter the lounge carefully leading the b
so theyve got him up and running
hes a very unusual android smiles runs in the family
they watch as data leads the b to a table
data instructs him to sit
the b sits and stares forward placidly
data shows him how use a napkin
a note of concern passes over deannas face as she watches data and the b
there is something strangely poignant in the twin androids
one a bundle of curiosity and intelligence the other somewhat like a slow simple child
picard is at his replicator unit
earl grey hot
a cup of tea appears
he takes it as the door chime sounds
deanna enters counselor
do you have a moment sir
of course sit down
he sits at his desk she sits across from him
its about data ive watched him with the b and im troubled
datas desire for a family is very strong
im afraid he may be investing too much in the b
youre speaking of emotional investment
the b is like a slow child sir
and data in his own way has assumed the position of a parent or guardian
im afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences
hell be disappointed when the b cannot meet those expectations
as much as we care for him deanna
we have to remember that data isnt capable of disappointment
i dont believe that sir
weve shared many disappointing journeys
a quiet beat
im going to miss you
and i you
they are interrupted by a comm signal captain you have an alpha priority communication from starfleet command
deanna stands ill talk to data thank you sir
picard activates his desktop viewscreen
admiral kathryn janeway appears on picards monitor
janeway is the former captain of voyager
her new rank fits her well she has lost none of her dry humor and down to earth charm which made her a household name and beloved cult figure
good to see you
howd you like a trip to romulus
all expenses paid
smiles with or without the rest of the fleet
a diplomatic mission
weve been invited believe it or not
seems theres been some kind of internal political shakeup
the new praetor someone called shinzon has requested a federation envoy
picard is surprised believe me we dont understand it either
youre the closest ship so i want you to high tail it over there and hear what he has to say
get the lay of the land if the empire becomes unstable it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant
were sending you all the intelligence we have but its not much
i dont need to tell you to watch your back jean luc
not with the romulans
smiles wryly the sona the borg the romulans the evil soran and that pesky nexus
you seem to get all the easy assignments
just lucky admiral
lets hope that luck holds
the transmission ends
picard sits for a moment intrigued
then he goes to the bridge picard goes to his command chair to helm lay in a new course
take us to romulus
the crew is shocked
aye aye sir
course plotted and laid in
im afraid the opal sea will have to wait number one
and the enterprise jumps to high warp disappearing in a flash of dazzling light
data conducts a briefing for the senior officers
monitors currently show an image of romulus and remus in orbit around their sun
as you can see the habitable half of remus is always in darkness because like mercury one side always faces the sun
due to the extreme temperatures on that half of their world the remans live on the dark side of the planet
various grainy and unclear new images appear to illustrate datas words almost nothing is known about the reman homeworld although intelligence scans have proven the existence of dilithium mining and
heavy weapons construction
very obscure images of remans appear the crew can barely make out the monstrous figures the remans themselves are considered an undesirable caste in the hierarchy of the empire
but they also have the reputation of being formidable warriors
in the dominion war reman forces were used as assault troops in the most violent encounters
grim cannon fodder
then how did a reman get to be praetor
i dont get it
we have to assume he had romulan collaborators
a coup detat
the praetors power has always been the romulan fleet
they must be behind him
picard considers this
to data what have you learned about shinzon
the images end
there are no images of shinzon
starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record
we can infer he is relatively young and a capable commander
he fought seventeen major engagements in the war
beyond that we know nothing
it seems were truly sailing into the unknown
keep at it
anything you can give me would be appreciated
the meeting breaks up
the b stares placidly forward
we pull back and discover that computer conduits connect the b s head to datas head
geordi monitors the connection
at present he serves no useful function
soong created us to become active and useful members of society
i do not believe he would have wanted the b to live out his life in his present state
i cant believe the captain went along with a memory download
captain picard agrees that the b was probably designed with the same self actualization parameters as myself
if my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix he should have all my abilities
hed have all your memories too
you feel comfortable with that
i feel nothing geordi
it is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual
an individual more like you you mean
maybe hes not supposed to be like you
maybe hes supposed to be just like he is
geordi completes his work okay
geordi removes the computer connections from between their heads
he carefully closes the panel in datas head as to b do you know where you are
i am in a room with lights
he looks blankly at the console lights
can you remember our father
data glances to geordi
do you know the name of the captain of this vessel
is that your final answer
to b do you know my name
you have a soft voice
gently data hes assimilating a lot of programming
remember hes a prototype a lot less sophisticated than you are
we just dont know if his matrix will be able to adapt
or if hell be able to retain anything
we should give him some time
data has been studying some circuitry in the b s neck
what purpose does this serve
also examining circuitry it seems to be a redundant memory port
maybe its for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload
soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions
its possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing
mind if i keep him here and run some diagnostics
no i do not mind
data looks at the b with a sort of sadness
but i believe he will prove incapable of performing higher functions
dont give up hope data
i know i know youre not capable of hope
looking at b i am not
the b stands to follow
no remain with commander la forge
he is going to try to make you well
the b sits
geordi watches him go
the enterprise is in orbit around romulus
remus can be seen in the distance
the enterprise has arrived at romulus and is waiting at the designated coordinates
all our hails have gone unanswered
weve been waiting for seventeen hours
the crew is tense
worf at tactical slowly stretches his neck
trying to release the tension
deanna jumps a bit
why dont they answer our hails
its an old psychological strategy number one
to put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy
to deanna counselor
theyre out there sir
picard stands and walks to the viewscreen
he gazes at romulus below and the black infinity of space beyond
theyre out there waiting
sir i recommend we raise shields
not yet mister worf
captain with all due respect to diplomatic protocols the federation councils not sitting out here we are
diplomacy is a very exacting occupation
we can wait
and on the viewscreen
shinzons magnificent reman warbird the scimitar decloaks directly before the enterprise
our first sight of this incredible ship is absolutely breathtaking
shinzons vessel combines the clean lines of the traditional romulan warbird with unique weaponry and styling
it is huge easily twice as large as the enterprise
and it is aggressive
awesome in its power
the crew gapes at the huge ship on the viewscreen
slowly rising from his chair my god
tense should i raise shields
firm tactical analysis mister worf
quickly analyzing tactical display fifty two disruptor banks twenty seven photon torpedo bays primary and secondary phased shields
shes not out for a pleasure cruise
grim shes a predator
were being hailed
and the image on the viewscreen transforms to shinzons viceroy
he stands on the scimitars bridge
the bridge is as unique as the rest of shinzons ship
instead of the usual mechanical clutter this bridge is designed with an almost asian simplicity
like the rest of reman design it is spare and elegant
since the remans are more comfortable in the darkness most of the light comes from the three steadily pulsing warp core relays which dramatically soar up through the floor of
the crew gazes at the bridge and the monstrous features of the viceroy
we are the reman warbird scimitar
praetor shinzon im pleased to i am not shinzon
i am his viceroy
we are sending transport coordinates
the transmission ends abruptly
the scimitar reappears on the viewscreen
not very chatty
transporter room four
picard riker deanna worf and data head toward the turbolift energized now that the endless waiting is over
the away team materializes in the most striking location on shinzons ship a large observation lounge
it is a huge empty chamber
a simple reman mat on the floor is the only decoration
at the very top of the room there is a large etched glass dome
it is very dark
they turn when shinzon speaks from the shadows i hope youll forgive the darkness
were not comfortable in the light
shinzon moves toward them a bit becoming slightly more illuminated the low light shining off his golden hair
the crew cannot see him clearly in the dim light but it is evident he is human
assuming that he was reman theyre surprised by this realization
shinzon just stares at picard through the darkness for a moment
jean luc picard
i dont mean to stare its just well you cant imagine how long ive been waiting for this moment
i always imagined you taller isnt that odd
to data you may scan me without subterfuge commander data
data scans him with a tricorder as and youre not as we imagined you
you are human
he speaks in klingon i greet you as a valiant warrior
and as my brother
terse in klingon ill save my greetings for a better brother
shinzon laughs maniacally
why have you asked for our presence here
shinzon does not answer
he is staring deeply at deanna moans softly
quietly ive never met a human woman
he slowly moves toward her still hidden in the shadows
im only half human
deanna troi of betazed
empathic and telepathic abilities ships counselor
all of this i knew
but i didnt know you were so beautiful
you seem very familiar with our personnel
shinzon moves even closer to deanna not taking his eyes from her
i am commander riker
to deanna may i touch your hair
firm praetor weve come to romulus on a matter we were assured was of great importance
if you have anything to say to us as representatives of the federation i suggest you do so now
shinzon continues to stare at deanna
it is strangely seductive
almost disquieting in its intensity
deanna handles it with grace her level gaze never leaving his
softly on the world i come from theres no light
beauty isnt important
i see now theres a world elsewhere
were not here to discuss your lack of a social life
turning back to picard yes im sorry captain
he smiles theres so much we have to talk about
i would be interested to know what we are talking about
tearing down the walls between us to recognize we are one people
federation and romulan
human and vulcan and klingon and reman
im speaking of the thing that makes us the same
we want peace
picard and the others are stunned
i want to end the centuries of mistrust
i want to be your ally not your enemy
as a first step i propose we eliminate the neutral zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas
and the senate supports you
dry i have dissolved the senate
right now youre thinking this all sounds too good to be true
and youre wondering why the scimitar is so well armed
is this the ship of a peacemaker
or a predator
picard is startled at shinzons choice of words but youre also thinking the chance for peace is too promising to ignore
above all youre trying to decide if you can trust me
then perhaps the time has come to add some illumination to our discussion
computer raise lighting four levels
lights shoot up around the room
for the first time the crew can see shinzon clearly
picard actually gasps when he sees shinzons face
the rest of the crew doesnt understand his reaction
allow me to tell you a story that i hope will clarify my position
when i was very young i was stricken with an odd disease
i developed a hyper sensitivity to sound
the slightest whisper caused me agony
picard watches him carefully
wary and strangely intense
no one knew what to do
finally i was taken to a doctor who had some experience with terran illnesses and i was finally diagnosed with shalafts syndrome
do you know of it captain
you know i do
the crew is dumbfounded at picards unusual reaction
then you know its a very rare syndrome
all the male members of my family had it
eventually i was treated
now i can hear as well as you can captain
he steps toward picard who holds his ground
i can see as well as you can
i can feel everything you feel
he stops right before picard in fact i feel exactly what you feel
dont i jean luc
picard stares at him with a mixture of realization and curiosity
it is as if picard is looking into a strange remembered mirror shinzons face is nearly identical to his at that age
do you trust me now
we need to talk just you and i
come to dinner on romulus tomorrow
just the two of us
or just the one of us
you know i need to verify this
the crew is utterly confused
their confusion turns to outright shock when shinzon calmly pulls out a reman knife and cuts his arm drawing a little blood
he hands the knife to data
tomorrow then captain
we have so much to discuss
picard touches his communicator pin picard to enterprise
five to beam out
they dematerialize the shimmering glow illuminating shinzons features
picards eyes never leave shinzon as the transporter effect ripples around him
beverly stands with picard riker and deanna
the reman knife is under a protonmicroscope and other medical readouts and analysis are visible
theres no doubt captain
right down to your regressive strain of shalafts syndrome
hes a clone
a beat as the confirmation sinks in
when was he
about twenty five years ago
they probably used a hair follicle or skin cell
touching head i think a skin cells the more likely of the two
believe me number one im going to find out
contact starfleet command and inform them of the situation
i need to know where the hell he came from
he goes deanna following
i would say hes been trained to resist telepathy
what i could sense of his emotions were erratic very hard to follow
is he sincere about wanting peace
i dont know
she stops him sir the strongest sense i had was that hes more than curious about you
he very much wants to know you
she looks at him deeply the same way you want to know him
how could i not
captain dont assume hes anything like you are
you should resist the urge to think you know him
i not only know him deanna i am him
and he is me
riker is hard at work over a series of padds
he has been working for hours
will you need to rest
he continues to work as ships counselor im recommending you get me sleep
riker tosses a padd on the desk
rubs his eyes
looks up her
she smiles and goes to him
we have time
she kisses him come to bed
she pulls him up
imzadi what am i going to do with you
they kiss deeply
she pulls him across the room and they fall into the bed
it is passionate erotic
her arms undulate around him sensually
her fingers snake through his hair but something is wrong
rikers hair is now blond
she starts back her eyes growing wide
riker is gone
she is now embracing shinzon
this is so good
he caresses her face
he can never know you as i know you
he can never touch you as i touch you
this isnt real
can you feel my hands
are they real
can you feel my lips my loins
he kisses her neck but when he raises his head again
it is the monstrous viceroy
she is frozen in horror
but is it the viceroy at all
shinzons voice seems to come from the viceroys lips im with you imzadi
and then it is shinzon again kissing her ill always be with you now
now and forever
you sick bastard
she pushes him away
whats with the name calling
it is riker
she stares at him then clings to him desperately
the byzantine splendors of the senate loom before us
heavy drapes are drawn against any hint of the sun
shinzon is in conference with the romulan commanders and senator talaura
commander donatra watches him closely
commander suran is angry pacing
his viceroy lurks in a corner
then i dont understand the reason for the delay
you dont have to understand
and bringing the enterprise here
what possible purpose could that serve
i have a purpose
then perhaps you will enlighten us
snaps silence romulan
a tense beat
shinzon regains his composure
you must learn patience commander
do you know where i learned it
in the dilithium mines of remus
spend eighteen hours every day under the lash of a romulan guards whip and youll soon understand patience
carefully bows his head praetor
i have some personal business
suran and the others go
donatra turns just as she is leaving the chamber she sees the viceroy going to shinzon
and then do something odd
the viceroy puts his hand on shinzons chest leans very close and talks to him quietly
this is an ancient form of reman telepathic medical diagnosis
this strange sight perplexes donatra
the doors close blocking her view
we go with donatra and the other romulans
donatra speaks quietly to suran how long before he has us in the dilithium mines
the b sits placidly in a chair staring forward
then as if a switch was thrown he moves
he quickly rises and goes to a computer console
he efficiently starts punching in commands at an amazing velocity
picard and shinzon sit alone in a corner of the sweeping senate chamber
the remains of dinner before them
and when i was ready they were going to replace you with me an exact biological duplicate
put a romulan agent at the heart of starfleet to influence your command structure
it was a bold plan
as happens so frequently here on romulus a new government came to power
they decided to abandon the plan frankly i think they were afraid id be discovered and it would lead to war
they werent ready for that
picard pours a glass of romulan ale
romulan ale im surprised
i cant stand it
smiles youll acquire a taste for it
they look at each other
its not quite the face you remember
i envy the hairline
a lifetime of violence will do that
my nose was broken four times
and my jaw
but so much is the same
the eyes you recognize the eyes
the eyes have it
our eyes reflect our lives dont they
yours are so confident
how did you end up on remus
they sent me there to die
how could a mere human survive the dilithium mines
he cant find the words i was a slave
and a monster
the only thing the romulan guards hated more than the remans was me
but one man took pity on me the man who became my viceroy
he taught me how to survive
and in that dark place where there was nothing of myself i found my reman brothers
they showed me the only kindness i ever knew
he glances to the romulan crest on the wall
for thousands of years the romulan senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister planet
but the time has come for us to live as equals
youre doing this to liberate the remans
no race should be a slave to another
picard is impressed with shinzons quiet words
you dont trust me
i have no reason to
of course you do
if you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people
youd be sitting where i am now
at least i hope you would
and if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great responsibility in representing the federation
i cant let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions
all i have is my personal feelings
i wasnt raised with the ideals of the federation
but im trying to understand them now
to live up to them to live up to you
i want to know where i come from
the remans gave me a future
you can tell me about my past
theres so much and so much of it is dull
were we always explorers
i was the first picard to leave earth
it caused quite a stir in fact
but i had spent my whole life
finishing the sentence looking up at the stars
and you dreamed about what was up there
finishing the sentence new worlds
they both reach for a carafe of water at the exact same instant
after you praetor
smiles age before rank jean luc
picard smiles pours a glass
so im not as tall as you expected
i always hoped i would hit two meters
with a full head of hair
smiles there is that
a quiet beat
im trying to believe you
if theres one ideal the federation holds most dear its that all men all races can be united
from the first time the vulcans came to earth weve sought a future of peace
nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friendship
when trust has been earned
im honored to think i might someday speak with such eloquence
in time jean luc
picard is gone
shinzon sits thinking
his viceroy enters
this is a mistake
hes gentler than i thought
and he has a sense of humor
stern dont forget our mission shinzon
we should act
time is running out
snaps my time
ill spend it how i choose
a tense beat
well return to the scimitar
prepare yourself for the bonding
picard emerges from the turbolift
data worf and geordi wait at the bridge engineering station
sir weve had an unauthorized access into the main computer
who was it
its going to take some time to find out the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship
what programs were accessed
thats what i dont get its mostly basic stellar cartography star charts communications protocols some uplinks from colony tracking stations
its not even restricted material
to worf set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting
if it happens again we want to be ready
grim theres something else
i was reviewing the sensor logs
he refers to some readouts on his console when the scimitar decloaked there was a momentary spike in the tertiary em band there youre not going to believe this but
picard is shocked
picard stands concerned with beverly geordi and data
monitors showing thalaron research are visible
i thought thalaron radiation was theoretical
which is why our initial scans didnt pick it up
but hes got it captain
as i remember thalaron research was banned in the federation because of its bioqenic properties
it has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level
i cant overestimate the danger of thalaron radiation jean luc
a microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds
keep on it
i need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat
give me options
data thinks for a moment
doctor will you excuse us for a moment
geordi please come with me
he and geordi head out
beverly returns to some medical displays showing thalaron research her expression deeply concerned
picard is sitting at his desk flipping through an old photo album
he stops and stares at one of the pictures deeply troubled
we finally see the photo young jean luc picard
a serious unsmiling cadet at starfleet academy
the face before him bears a disturbing resemblance to shinzon
the door comm chirps
beverly enters beverly come in
youre working late
she sits notes the picture of young jean luc
he was a bit proud as i recall
he was a damn fool
selfish and ambitious
very much in need of seasoning
he turned out all right
he rises goes to a window gazes at the scimitar in the distance
i so wanted to believe shinzon
but the thalaron radiation cant be explained away
whatever hes after its not peace
is he very much like you were
data interrupts on comm data to captain picard
geordi and i have identified the source of the unauthorized computer access
and i believe we have also discovered an opportunity to gain a tactical advantage
to comm on my way
stands jean luc whatever you were right now youre the man youve made yourself
hes someone else
i wish i could believe that doctor
deanna is alone on the turbolift
then a voice makes her spin imzadi
shinzon stands across from her
youre not here
moving to her very logical deanna
but your heart doesnt constrain itself to mere logic
he caresses her your heart longs to discover me
to know me
he kisses her to leave all of this behind and be with me
he pushes her against the wall with passion and almost violence
i can feel your desire deanna
she forces herself to concentrate
to resist telepathically
it is a mighty effort
this romulan is hot
and the world around her appears to be changing
and she is momentarily in a cabin on the scimitar
although entirely a telepathic experience it is as if she has actually traveled
she sees shinzon kneeling over a small flame she realizes she is looking through the viceroys eyes
on the scimitar shinzon looks up at the viceroy deanna i can feel your hunger to know the reman ways
the old ways
then the world changes again
deanna is on the turbolift
shinzon is pressed against her whispering dont fear what you desire
she forces him away from her and she is alone
she sinks to her knees
overcome with emotion
the viceroy in a kind of trace kneels before a small flame
shinzon kneels across from him
the viceroy raises his head
the bond is broken
find her again
no this is wasting time
do as i tell you
a reman officer interrupts on comm praetor weve received the transponder signal
to comm on my way
he begins to go but suddenly stops a wave of illness overtaking him
the viceroy puts his hand on shinzons chest
a strange moment as the viceroy shuts his eyes and feels shinzons chest
then the viceroy looks up at him grim
you have no more time for games
have the doctors prepare
ill be on the bridge
shinzon stands with some reman engineers
an engineer activates a transporter and the b materializes
to engineers begin the download
reman engineers go to the b and open the panel in his neck begin connecting computer conduits to the extra memory port we saw earlier
note although the audience will not know it yet this is actually data pretending to be the b
shinzon goes to a replicator unit and orders tea hot
a cup of tea appears
he takes it and sips as he watches his engineers connecting the conduits to the b
beverly is scanning deanna
picard and riker watch concerned
aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels youre completely normal
gently can you describe it deanna
she looks at picard tears in her eyes
riker takes her hand
with difficulty shinzons viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts
ive become a liability
i request to be relieved of my duties
if you can possibly endure any more of these assaults
i need you at my side
now more than ever i
but before the words are out of his mouth
he begins to dematerialize
to comm worf
but picard is gone
the scimitar cloaks
picard stands in the reman brig
his communicator pin has been removed
beyond the security force field a ghoulish medical apparatus is being prepared
a metal chair with laser scalpels iv tubes and hyposprays connected to it
reman doctors work over the mysterious chair
shinzon enters with the b following
shinzon stands on the other side of the force field
picard notices something immediately
tiny veins are now visible on shinzons face the faintest sign of an intricate spider web pattern of pale blue veins
hello jean luc
why am i here
i was lonely
he realizes picard is staring at the veins on his face perhaps im not aging as well as you did
he nods to a guard
the guard deactivates the force field
a reman doctor enters and raises a hypospray toward picard
resists what are you doing
i need a sample of your blood
what do your borg friends say
resistance is futile
maniacal laugh the doctor takes a quick sample of picards blood as picard glances to the b
the bait you couldnt refuse
i learned there might be an existing prototype from a cardassian historian then went to a great deal of trouble to find it and scatter it about on kolarus iii
i knew it would pique your curiosity and conveniently make the enterprise the closest ship to romulus when i contacted starfleet
the reman doctor leaves the cell
the force field is reactivated
the doctor goes to the mysterious medical apparatus and analyzes picards blood
as all of this so you could capture me
dont be so vain
after we found it we made a few modifications
an extra memory port a hidden transponder
perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn ive gained access to starfleets communications protocols
i now know the location of your entire fleet
to b you may go
out of my sight
the b obediently leaves the room as maybe ill train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does
or maybe ill snap its ugly head off
whats this all about
its about destiny picard
about a reman outcast who youre not reman
and im not quite human
so what am i
what do you see
he peers at picard deeply do you see a life you might have led
lost youth never to be recaptured
i see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is
i see an old man set in his ways afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a starfleet regulation to tell him what to do
i see the man i will never be
i wont defend my life to you
my life is meaningless as long as youre alive
what am i while you exist
stern if your issues are with me
this has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the federation
oh but it does
we will no longer bow like slaves before anyone
not the romulans and not your mighty federation
were a race bred for war
think about what youre doing shinzon
are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons
it amazes me how little you know yourself
im incapable of such an act and so are you
i think the facts speak for themselves
the same noble picard blood runs in our veins
had you lived my life youd be doing exactly as i am
look in the mirror and see yourself
shinzon looks at him deeply
consider that captain
i can think of no greater torment for you
he turns to go
its a mirror for you as well
shinzon turns back to him
picard gazes at him evenly
picards probing gaze makes shinzon a bit uneasy
he glances to the ghoulish medical preparations
not for long captain
back to picard im afraid you wont survive to witness the victory of the echo over the voice
the ship is on red alert
worf stands at tactical muscles coiled hungry for action
no response to our hails
geordi is hard at work at the science station
riker stands over him frustrated his cloak is perfect
no tachyon emissions no residual antiprotons
keep at it geordi
find a way in
beverly arrives on the bridge urgent
she carries a medical padd
will i need to talk to you
picard stands in his cell peering at the edges of the security force field trying to spot any weakness
then the b enters the brig he holds a reman disruptor weapon
to reman guard i am to take the prisoner to the praetor
the reman guard deactivates the force field
if you resist i will incapacitate you
he leads picard out
the b leads picard through the dark corridors holding the disruptor on him steadily
all the remans they pass glare at picard with undisguised loathing
the viceroy approaches
stops before them
to b where are you taking him
praetor shinzon wants him on the bridge
the viceroy turns his malevolent gaze on picard
youve met your better self
what are you doing to counsellor troi
im preparing her for shinzon
to sooth him as she soothes you
to stand at his side as she does at yours
that will never happen
listen to him android
such a small and weak creature
yet he roars so valiantly
he raises one taloned claw and puts a sharp fingernail on picards chest it would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest
therell be another after me
and another after that
youll find were a resilient species
i look forward to the sport
to the b harshly take him
the b prods picards back roughly with the disruptor
picard grimaces in pain move
the viceroy continues away down the corridor
the b leads picard along
whispers be careful of over playing your part commander
and the audience now realizes it is data pretending to be the b and rejoices
i thought it added a touch of reality to the performance
they are silent as they pass a few reman guards
then my mission was a success sir
i have discovered the source of the thalaron radiation
he believes he has our communications protocols
but they will give him inaccurate locations for all starfleet vessels
data assumes the b s posture again as they pass some some reman warriors
move puny human animal
they pass the warriors
a bit less florid data
he leads picard down the corridor
data leads picard into a massive chamber that soars up like a cathedral
it is the size of a small town
the whole cavernous chamber pulses with glowing green light
this entire ship is essentially a flying thalaron generator
he points up all its power relays lead to that device
high above them at the very top of the chamber is a gigantic version of the spider weapon we saw kill all the romulan senators before
it is breathtaking
it would appear so
data rotates his left hand and then slides it forward exposing a hidden compartment in his wrist
he removes a small silver disc
this is a cool new piece of federation technology called an etu
emergency transport unit
geordi equipped me with the prototype for the emergency transport unit
i recommend you use it to return to the enterprise
itll only work for one of us
well find a way off together
there is a shuttlebay meters from our current location
data inserts the etu back into his wrist and they leave the chamber
the viceroy arrives on the bridge stops
shinzon looks at him confused
security alert klaxons suddenly begin to howl and harsh reman commands are broadcast through the corridors
this way sir
they sprint down the twisting dark corridors reman warriors suddenly appear before them
data fires the disruptor as picard launches himself into them a fight picard uses a dazzlinq series of starfleet hand to hand maneuvers he dramatically subdues the remans
more reman warriors appear down the corridor
picard grabs a disruptor
and instantly spins to fire a blazing disruptor
a battle breaks out in the corridor the energy beams and explosions illuminating the violent fire fight in strobe like bursts
they run to another corridor and finally arrive at the shuttlebay door it does not open
looking at door security panel it seems to have an encrypted security system
reman warriors are closing in on them
data tosses his disruptor to picard picard catches it and instantly spins and fires he uses both disruptors to fire down both ends of the corridor like a western sheriff
keeping the remans at bay as data uses both hands to punch numbers into the shuttlebay door security panel at an amazing rate alacrity would be appreciated commander
they are trying to override the access codes
reman is really a most complex language with pictographs representing certain verb roots and while i find that fascinating data we really need that goddamned door open
the shuttlebay door slides open
picard lays down a blistering barrage of cover fire as he and data duck into the shuttlebay
when the door closes behind them picard turns and fires a disruptor blast sealing the door mechanism
they turn to face
a fleet of very small shuttles
they are uniquely designed
extremely compact and stream lined
a disruptor turret on each
they move toward one as according to the ships manifest they are scorpion class attack fliers
they quickly climb a scorpion
the cockpit of the scorpion is cramped
picard climbs into the pilots position
data assumes the gunners position
they see disruptor fire trying to burn through the door to the shuttlebay picard powers up the scorpion as trying to figure out the controls what do you imagine this
port thrusters sir
would you like me to drive
picard shoots him a look and presses some controls
the scorpion lifts off
hovers a few feet over the deck
picard elegantly swings it around toward the large shuttlebay external doors as can you open the shuttlebay doors
working controls affirmative sir
they have instigated security overrides and erected a force field around the external portals
only one way to go
he swings the scorpion around again so it is facing the doors they came through the doors back into the ship
data is dubious
do you think this is a wise course of action
were about to find out
power up disruptors and fire on my mark
and the scorpions forward disruptors fire
the doors into the ship explode
picard powers forward
and the scorpion shoots into the corridor past the stunned remans
picard banks sharply careens off the far side of the corridor but keeps control
the scorpion zooms down the corridor
picard is concentrating intensely it is like trying to control the worlds fastest roller coaster
the scorpion banks around a corner it zigs and zags through the ship at breakneck speed the doors to the observation lounge explode in
the scorpion shoots into the room and up a disruptor blast shatters the etched glass dome at the top of the room and the scorpion zooms triumphantly into space
the scorpion seems to appear from nowhere slicing through the cloak of invisibility around the scimitar the crew sees the scorpion appear on the viewscreen
lock on transporters
shinzon sees the scorpion as well
but they are too late the scorpion dematerializes and materializes in one of the enterprises cargo bays
picard and data climb out to comm number one emergency warp
the enterprise dramatically powers forward and up rolling over in a great arc going into warp while still upside down
it disappears in a blaze of light
shinzon sits in his command chair as the ship streaks through space
he speaks on viewscreen with his romulan collaborators
his face is even more finely veined now
the enterprise is immaterial
they wont make it back to federation space
angry this has gone far enough
i thought we discussed patience commander
and mine is wearing thin young man
we supported you because you promised action
and yet you delay and you waste your time playing games with picard while shinzon stands and briskly pulls down his uniform tunic exactly as weve seen picard do a
commander suran the games are over
in two days the federation will be crippled beyond repair
does that satisfy you
grim for the moment
brutal and when i return
you and i shall have a little talk about showing proper respect
the viewscreen picture of shinzon snaps out
the romulan sit for a silent beat
does anyone in this room harbor any illusions about what he means by showing proper respect
whats happening to his face
i want opinions
he is clearly out of his mind
but can he complete his mission
they look at her
are you prepared to have your hands drenched in blood
hell show them no mercy
and his sins will mark us all for generations
is that what you truly want romulans
i think you should consider that question now or else you may have a lifetime to think about it in the dilithium mines
she turns and stalks out
beverly sits with picard and riker
the more i studied his dna the more confusing it got
finally i could only come to one conclusion
shinzon was created with temporal rna sequencing
he was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly so he could replace you
but the romulans abandoned the plan
as a result the temporal sequencing was never activated
remember he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age
he was engineered to skip thirty years of life
but since the rna sequencing was never activated his cellular structure has started to break down
he wasnt designed to live a complete human life span
plcard can anything be done for him
not without a complete myelodysplastic infusion from the only donor with compatible dna
but that would mean draining all your blood
thats why he went to all that trouble to capture you
plcard how long does he have
i cant be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating
picard considers this
then hell come for me as a donor
data stands before the b
the b has been deactivated he stands lifeless and immobile
data gazes deeply into his doubles identical features
then he opens a panel in the b s neck and uses a small instrument to activate the androids head
the b s eyes spring to life
he looks at data
i cannot move
no i have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines
because you are dangerous
you have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship
i do not understand
do you know anything about shinzons plans against the federation
do you have any knowledge of the tactical abilities of his ship
can i move now
i must deactivate you
for how long
how long is that
data gazes at the b deeply
a long time brother
data reaches forward and deactivates his brother
the b s eyes lose the spark of life
he stands frozen
data stands before him
picard is gathered with his senior officers
a computer display illustrates geordis words about the power of shinzons weapon
we see a chilling graphic of the biogenic pulse beam spreading around a ship then a whole planet
its called a cascading biogenic pulse
the unique properties of thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits
depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship
or a planet
thinking and thats exactly what hes going to do
his hatred of the federation is apparent
he would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason
he is going after earth
destroy humanity and the federation is crippled
and the romulans invade
how can you be certain
i know how he thinks
to geordi and theres no way to penetrate his cloak
frustrated he could pass within meters of every ship in starfleet and theyd never know
but we do have one advantage
to picard he needs your blood to live
he might come after you first
im counting on it
weve been ordered to head to sector
starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there
strength in numbers
we can only hope so
a beat as he looks at them gravely
he cant be allowed to use that weapon
all other concerns are secondary
do you understand me
riker knows exactly what picard is saying the enterprise is expendable
presses a comm button
we see a montage of the enterprise preparing for battle
crew members assume battle stations
weapons locker ring open and security officers hand out sidearms and phaser rifles
geordi and his engineers establish emergency force field around the warp core
riker and worf brief officers on tactical plans
data works at the bridge science station analyzing data on shinzons ship
picard walks through the corridors he stops to talk with apprehensive young ensign
as we hear captains personal log
were heading toward federation space at maximum warp
the crew has responded with the dedication ive come to expect of them
and like a thousand other commanders on a thousand other battlefields throughout history i wait for the dawn
the montage ends as
picard enters sickbay
crusher and her medical staff are hard at work
they position anti grav gurneys and ready medical supplies
security officers are handing out phasers
picard watches the grim preparations
beverly goes to him bolstering her phaser
quietly to seek out new life and new civilizations
zephyr cochrans own words
when charles darwin set out on the h
beagle on his journey into the unknown
he sailed without a single musket
gently that was another time
how far weve come
let me know if you need anything
he starts to go jean luc
he stops he is not you
what makes us who we are doctor
can you tell me that
she watches him go
shinzon sits in his command chair lined with veins now
his viceroy again has his hand pressed to shinzons chest
a matter of hours now shinzon shoves him away
if you dont begin the procedure soon youll never make it back to romulus
you shouldnt have delayed
you should have killed picard the moment shinzon slams his command chair in fury
the viceroy watches him carefully
shinzon regains his composure
he sits again in his command chair
how long until we reach the rift
checks a console seven minutes
shinzon leans back satisfied
and looks at the viewscreen
the image on the viewscreen is shocking
the enterprise only a few hundred yards away
the enterprise zooms through space
completely unaware of the predator directly above it
data is at work in astrometry
cartographic projections of star systems ebb and flow on a large screen before him
show me our current position
the images before them quickly change to show another sector and a blip representing the enterprise
how long until we reach the fleet
at our current velocity we will arrive at sector in approximately minutes
the images before them change to show sector
we see blips denoting starfleet ships moving into position
picard gazes at the projection of stars before them for a moment
quietly for now we see but through a glass darkly
he said hes a mirror
i do not agree
although you share the same genetic structure the events of your life have created unique individual
but so much is the same
on a biological level he is
and i will not accept the idea that there is nothing i can do
i have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him
he would deny a human connection is possible
he considers himself entirely reman
he may have already rejected my humanity but you also have a twin
no sir it is not possible
the b is physically identical to me although his neural pathways are not as advanced
but even if they were he would not be me
how can you be sure
i aspire sir
to be better than i am
the b does not
nor does shinzon
well never know what shinzon might have been
had he stood where i did as a child
and looked up at the stars
picards words linger in the air for a moment
then the projections before them sputter with static for a moment
working controls we are passing through the bassen rift
the projections will return when we have cleared it
its interfering with our uplink from starfleet cartography
the rift effects all long range communications urgent to comm commander riker evasive maneuvers
the ship quakes a photon torpedo blast the enterprise is under attack
disruptor beams appear from nowhere streaking through space slamming into the enterprises warp drive
the enterprise recoils dangerously dropping out of warp in a furious lurch
the bassen rift is a strange area of electromagnetic distortion
energy patterns crackle through space
shinzon sits in his command chair
the viewscreen shows the enterprise before him
target weapons systems and shields
i dont want the enterprise destroyed
on the viewscreen we see disruptor blasts streaking from the scimitar slicing into the enterprise
can you learn to see in the dark captain
picard and data emerge from the turbolift as the ship report
hes firing through his cloak
we cant get a lock
at engineering station he disabled our warp drive with his first shot
weve only got impulse
long range communication is impossible as long as were in the rift the ship shudders again worf prepare a full phaser spread zero elevation
all banks on my mark
scan for shield impacts and stand by photon torpedoes
aye sir the ship rocks again
the enterprise fires her phasers simultaneously the energy beams shoot into space and the scimitars shape is momentarily illuminated as one of its shields is hit
photon torpedoes immediately shoot from the enterprise but pass harmlessly through the area where the scimitars shields were momentarily illuminated
youre too slow old man
entering commands in his chair console attack pattern shinzon theta
the invisible warbird makes a dramatic run straight over the enterprise firing steadily down as it sweeps past it is a brutal close range assault the bridge shakes violently under
the ruthless attack we are losing dorsal shields full axis rotation to port
fire all ventral phasers
the enterprise instantly complies rolling completely over to the left firing phasers up as shinzons invisible ship streaks above it a few lucky phaser shots from the bottom of the
enterprise now shooting upward manage to momentarily illuminate the bottom shields of the scimitar as it sweeps past above
minimal damage to the scimitar
to helm defensive pattern kirk epsilon
geordi get those shields online
to comm counselor troi report to the bridge
unless we can disable his cloak were just going to be firing in the dark
sir were being hailed
shinzon appears on the viewscreen
he is on the bridge of the scimitar
captain picard will you join me in your ready room
picard stands in his ready room
a flickering light shimmers across the room
and a perfect holographic representation of shinzon appears before him
you cant trace my holographic emitters captain
so dont bother
and you cant contact starfleet
were quite alone
its just the two of us now jean luc as it should be
your ship and mine
you and me
why are you here
to accept your surrender
i can clearly destroy you at any time
lower your shields and allow me to transport you to my ship
and what of the enterprise
i have little interest in your quaint vessel captain
if the enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years it will not be harmed
you know thats not possible
youll all gladly die to save your home world
intense look at me shinzon
do you feel the blood pumping inside you
your hands your eyes your nature are the same as mine
buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity youve forgotten
its the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because its the very thing that truly defines us
to be human is to try to make yourself better than you are
picard looks at him deeply relentlessly refusing to give up
i know you as well as i know myself shinzon
there was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be
quietly long ago
not so long
childish dreams captain
lost in the dilithium mines of remus
im what you see now
i see more than what you are
picard steps toward him
i see what you could be
shinzon slowly backs away as picard continues to move toward him relentlessly
the man who is jean luc picard and shinzon of remus wont exterminate the population of an entire planet
he is better than that
desperate he is what his life has made him
shinzon is in turmoil
picard senses this
he proceeds quietly and what will he do with that life
shinzon looks at him questioning
if i were to beam to your ship
let you complete your medical procedure give you a full life
what would you do with the time
shinzon doesnt respond
you once asked me about your past
when i was your age i burned with ambition
i was very proud and my pride often hurt people
i made every wrong choice a young man can
but one thing saved me
i had a father who believed in me
who took the time to teach me a better way
you have the same father
so if i gave you my life what would you do with it
would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now
or could you change
could you try to remember a mothers touch you never felt
a fathers words you never heard
could you do that
quietly i dont know
but you want to
shinzon doesnt respond
but picard knows he has made a connection
for this brief moment reconciliation is possible
he proceeds quietly let me tell you about our father
shinzon looks at him with an aching sadness
what might have been
thats your life
its too late
you can still make a choice
make the right one now
i have no choices
i cant fight what i am
shinzon backs away unable to fight his nature ill show you my true nature
and as earth dies remember that im forever shinzon of remus
and my voice will echo through time long after yours has faded to a dim memory
shinzon ends the transmission and his holographic image flickers and fades away
picard stands alone drained
shinzon strides quickly to his command chair barking to his viceroy disable their weapons
but before the viceroy can move the scimitar suddenly rocks attacked from somewhere
shinzon is stunned
two ships decloaking sir
picard strides to his command chair as two romulan warbirds appear on the viewscreen
deanna is now on the bridge
believe it or not i think the cavalry has arrived
were being hailed
on the viewscreen commander donatra shimmers into view
captain picard commander donatra of the warbird valdore
might we be of assistance
your timing is impeccable commander
the empire considers this a matter of internal security
we regret youve become involved
when this is over i owe you a drink
on the viewscreen the valdore rocks from a disruptor blast
romulan ale captain
lets get to work
the transmission ends
to worf you heard the lady
get to work
move your ass
the romulan warbirds must remain decloaked to fire weapons and are visible throughout the battle
although shinzons ship is still cloaked the steady barrage of triangulated phaser and disruptor fire from the enterprise and the two romulan vessels illuminate its shields with impacts
to worf coordinate our attack with the valdores tactical officer
triangulate fire on any shield impacts
the enterprise rocks from a photon torpedo impact aft shields are down to forty percent
to helm keep our bow to the scimitar
auxiliary power to forward shields
shinzon sits quite calmly in his command chair
target the flanking warbird
all forward disruptor banks on my mark
it is a chaos of starships as the enterprise and the two warbirds fire steadily illuminating the scimitars shields
the ships sweep around one another maneuvering for position firing constantly
the battlefield seems impossibly crowded as the four vessels evade and attack as phaser and disruptor beams criss cross space
then the scimitar unleashes a devastating volley
all her forward disruptor banks fire at once they literally cut one of the romulan ships in half a huge explosion debris shoots across space and slams violently off the
enterprises forward shields
the ship rocks dangerously
forward shields are down to ten percent
to helm bring us about
the enterprise quickly turns about firing her aft phasers as the valdore sweeps toward shinzons ship firing let her pursue drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for
full emergency stop
you heard me
donatra leans forward in her command chair looking at viewscreen
she sees part of the scimitars rear cloakning fall away shes losing her cloak
stand by all forward disruptor banks
shes almost on us
on the viewscreen we see the valdore in pursuit gaining
the reman crew is getting nervous
the scimitar lurches to a stop
too fast for the valdore to respond in time it flies over the scimitar and the scimitar fires
a devastating volley of photon torpedoes rip into the underbelly and aft of the valdore as it streaks past the valdore careens out of control and then slows to a
it floats dead in space
restore the aft cloak
and bring us about
he leans back in his command chair ready for the final battle
a bloody commander donatra is talking to picard on viewscreen
her bridge is in ruins
im afraid that drink will have to wait captain
do you have life support
for the moment
but were dead in the water
understood then the ship rocks the invisible scimitar sweeps past for a particularly brutal assault disruptor blasts streak along the enterprises hull a huge ripping series of explosions tear away
several decks of the enterprise we have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen sections four through ten
emergency force fields are holding
evacuate those decks and reroute field power to forward shields
deanna goes to picard captain i might have a way to find them
the one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle me
make it so
she quickly goes to worf at tactical
shinzon is entering tactical commands in his chair console
prepare a lateral run all starboard disruptors
then the viceroy suddenly stiffens alarm in his eyes no
deanna concentrates furiously eyes closed
she stands with worf her hand slowly moving his over the photon torpedo targeting display
it is a wrenching experience as she probes with her thoughts
hes resisting me
she is in pain
the viceroy concentrates trying to block her probing thoughts
what is it
focus on your job
she is here
deanna continues to move worfs hand over the targeting display
she is sweating panting for breath concentrating fiercely
the viceroy resists her their psyches lock in battle
deanna appears in the viceroys mind she glares at him
her eyes snap open worf instantly fires a full volley of photon torpedoes
a full spread of photon torpedoes shoot through space
a series of devastating impacts and the scimitars cloak fails
picard stands quickly
and the enterprise attacks
it fires all weapons simultaneously phasers and photon torpedoes slam into the scimitar
shinzons ship responds quickly maneuvering for position and returning fire
the bridge has been damaged sparks sputter through the darkness and debris litters the deck
shinzon eyes reflect a growing sense of desperation
spinning to his viceroy prepare a boarding party bring the viceroy strides out as shinzon spins to another officer
get the cloak back
and target shield coordinates beta three
on the viewscreen we see disruptor beams focusing on a tiny part of the enterprises lower shields slamming into them
captain we have lost ventral shielding on deck twenty nine
divert power and compensate an alarm klaxon suddenly rings through the bridge
riker and worf quickly head toward the turbolift as to comm security detail to deck twenty nine
data immediately assumes worfs position at tactical
riker and worf stride with a security detail through the cramped lower decks
a sudden disruptor blast stops them cold
the viceroy and his invasion force of a dozen reman warriors are down the corridor
the enterprise crew returns fire
it is a blazing phaser battle worf leading his men with klingon courage
they steadily advance in the face of the blistering disruptor fire they are getting the upper hand when riker sees the viceroy escape into a jefferies tube worf
worf instantly dives into the corridor landing hard and sliding forward on his stomach all the while firing a steady burst from his phaser rifle
riker uses the cover to dive after the viceroy following him into the dark jefferies tube intent on destroying the man who has been tormenting his wife the scimitar sweeps
into view on the viewscreen filling the screen and launches a ferocious volley of photon torpedoes
a huge explosion as the viewscreen and some of the forward bridge are blown apart the helm officer is sucked into space before a flickering emergency force field springs into
position deanna races to assume the helm picard can now see his enemy directly through the gaping hole in the ships hull he sees the scimitar banking for another attack run as part of the ship disappears hes getting his cloak back
we have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes
phaser banks are down to four percent
what if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack
the scimitars shields are still at seventy percent
it would make no difference sir
through the hole in the hull picard sees the scimitar slowly turning
they see another part of the scimitar disappear the cloak returning
whats he doing
grim he wants to look me in the eye
below decks riker stalks the viceroy through a labyrinthine series of access tunnels
it is like a scene from alien
the flickering half light and red emergency strobes of the crippled ship make this an ominous sequence
the viceroy is in his element used to the perpetual night of the reman homeworld he can see in the dark
riker moves through the darkness hunting for the viceroy
he stops phaser ready
he peers into the dark tunnel ahead of him
we tilt up and see
the viceroy clinging to the ceiling directly above riker
hidden in the darkness
the viceroy attacks
diving down on riker his lethal reman knife slashing through the darkness picard stands
watching the scimitar maneuver into position
large parts of it are now cloaked
only a few hundred yards from the enterprise its great prow almost filling the gaping hole at the front of the bridge
picard thinks his mind racing
then it comes to him in a flash he thinks he knows exactly what im going to do
weve got him
he sits in his command chair and begins quickly entering command instructions in his chair console
shinzon supremely confident leans back in his command chair
open a channel
picard is still entering commands in his chair console
we are being hailed
deanna stand by
to data open a channel
i hope youre still alive jean luc
dont you think its time to surrender
ill have my cloak back in a matter of minutes and your poor ship is shot to pieces
why should the rest of your crew have to die
picard continues to enter command codes transmits them to deanna at helm she receives the commands nods
all of this as picard buys some time i never told you about my first academy evaluation did i
i received very high marks for my studies
but i was found lacking in certain other areas
personality traits you might say
in particular i was thought to be extremely
he glares up at the prow of the scimitar over confident
picard indicates for data to end the communication
then quickly geordi put power to the engines
take it from life support if you have to everything you can give me
deanna on my mark
picard leans forward in his chair on comm all hands brace for impact
to deanna the enterprise powers forward in a final thrust
shinzon sees it coming utterly shocked bolts up too late
a massive collision as the enterprise slams into the scimitar as it smashes and grinds into shinzons ship the scimitar reels everyone goes flying
the two great ships are now locked together slowly rotating in space
the forward part of the enterprises saucer is enmeshed in shinzons ship two scorpions with their claws locked
shinzon stands in the ruins of his bridge
many of his bridge crew are now dead
divert all power to engines
every part of the enterprise rocks a great lurch as the scimitar begins to tear itself free backing away a deafening shriek of metal both ships are being torn to
pieces in the process but it is working the scimitar is ripping free wrenching itself loose
the jefferies tube shudders as the scimitar continues to tear itself free riker and the viceroy careen through the tube
the viceroy recovers quickly and coils for a final attack
riker sees that an access plate has been loosened in the collision he desperately rips it away knowing the relays behind will provide him with the advantage he needs bright
light strobes from the relays and the viceroy is momentarily blinded riker uses this opportunity to attack
he dives forward slamming into the viceroy they both tumble into a long vertical access tunnel they fall
riker shoots out a hand and grabs a ladder the viceroy grabs onto riker his talons digging into his uniform a long drop below them
riker forces the viceroys head back away from him a brutal struggle riker glares at him
dont worry hell is dark
riker uses every ounce of strength he has left pushes the viceroy off him the viceroy falls down the long tunnel to his death
the whole enterprise bridge quakes as the scimitar continues to pull itself free picard stands steadying himself on his command chair
data i need you
data joins picard as computer
auto destruct sequence omega
zero time delay
recognize voice pattern jean luc picard
authorization alpha alpha three zero five auto destruct is off line
then the ship gives a final lurch
the scimitar is free
an eerie moment of silence after the explosive tearing and grinding
picard watches through the gaping hole in the hull as the scimitar backs away
another section of the scimitar disappears
shinzon almost has his cloak back
shinzon stares at the enterprise
a wave of sickness overcomes him for a moment he doubles over
we actually see more veins appearing on his face
time is running out
disruptors are off line sir
shinzon looks up
deploy the weapon
kill everything on that ship
then set a course for earth
what about picard
our greater goal is more important brother
but praetor you wont survive without him
shinzon gazes at the enterprise on the viewscreen
some ideals are worth dying for arent they jean luc
the entire scimitar slowly begins to unfold
like a gigantic version of the small spider weapon we saw kill the romulan senators before legs appear and hoist up a savage weapon
the cascading pulse
picard and the others watch the monstrous cascading pulse weapon slowly deploying
how long until he can fire
the targeting sequence should take about four minutes
but how can he
hell kill you
this isnt about me anymore
picards face is set resolute
he knows what he must do
picard grabs a phaser rifle from a weapons locker as
prepare for a site to site transport
concerned sir we wont be able to bring you back
its a one way trip
captain i dont know if the transporter thats an order commander
sir allow me to go
you are needed here
deanna takes datas arm
looks at him
she knows this is something picard must do himself
let him go
picard powers up the phaser rifle as to data you have the bridge commander
use all available power to move away from the scimitar
to geordi now mister la forge
geordi nervously works some controls on his console and picard dematerializes
then the transporter panel explodes in a shower of sparks
transporters are down
data thinks for a moment
then counsellor troi please assume command
geordi if you will come with me
he heads toward the turbolift geordi following
several remen warriors in the corridor turn and fire
riker returns fire a series of lightning fast pulses from his phaser rifle
data and geordi stand in a long corridor
the far end of the corridor opens to space
an emergency force field is in place at the end of the corridor
geordi operates a tricorder and another force field flickers on around him
data looks toward the end of the corridor readying himself
what is our approximate distance
scans with tricorder meters
data backs up a little more he looks at geordi again
thank you geordi
deactivate the field
geordi operates his tricorder and the force field at the end of the corridor snaps off the void of space fills the corridor and data takes a running start he
races down the long corridor and leaps into space
he floats toward the scimitar his momentum carrying him
carrying him too far
he is going to miss the scimitar almost past it now
he thrusts out a hand and just misses a piece of dangling wreckage
data is floating helplessly through space
then he slams into an invisible piece of the partially cloaked on the ship
he grabs onto the invisible part of the ship and pulls himself up to the hull
he rips open an access panel with his superior strength and climbs inside
shinzon stands his eyes glued to the enterprise on the viewscreen
we see a monitor showing that the cascading pulse weapon is locked on the enterprise
most of the light on the shattered bridge now comes from the three steadily pulsing warp core relays which soar up through the floor
suddenly a massive blast as the doors to the bridge explode in
shinzon spins to see picard framed in the doorway phaser rifle ready
picard instantly fires for the cascading pulse control but shinzon dives to cover it the phaser blast hits shinzon in the chest he recoils slamming to the deck stunned
the few remaining remans on the bridge spin to picard firing disruptors picard dives for cover and battles them with his phaser rifle he succeeds in stunning the remans but
a final disruptor blast knocks picard to the deck the phaser rifle spins away twenty nine
shinzon pulls himself up and races to snatch up a disruptor from a fallen comrade as picard leaps up grabbing a piece of wreckage a long metal rod picard thrusts
it forward like a spear impaling shinzon
a stunned moment of silence as shinzon gazes at picard almost with a look of disbelief
blood spews from his mouth as he lets out a tormented cry
and then amazingly shinzon forces himself forward pushing picard back against a wall shinzon slowly walks toward picard forcing himself down the length of the spear the spear point explodes
through shinzons back the weight of shinzons body is pinning picard against the wall time is running out eighteen
shinzon forces himself down the spear im glad were together now our destiny is complete
he finally thrusts himself down the whole spear and clasps his dying hands firmly around picards throat ten
data sprints to the bridge he instantly tears open his wrist and pulls out the small silver disc we saw earlier the emergency transport unit he slaps it on picards
a final look between them seven
data activates the etu picard dematerializes
data looks at the space where picard was and says simply goodbye
then he spins and pulls out his phaser and fires point blank into the scimitars warp core relays the bridge explodes data is incinerated the scimitar blasts apart in a
massive flash picard re materializes
he sees the brilliant flash from the explosion through the gaping hole in the front of the bridge
deanna sits at helm her face a mask of pain
geordi stands on the upper rear deck head down
a long beat as picard just stands on his ruined bridge the thousand yard stare of a combat veteran in his eyes
riker emerges from the turbolift
goes to picard
picard doesnt answer he just stares forward
deanna goes to riker
riker looks toward the glowing debris field in the distance
he puts an arm around deanna
sir were being hailed
he remembers there is no longer a viewscreen open a channel
this is commander donatra of the valdore
were dispatching shuttles with medical personnel and supplies
thank you commander
the transmission ends
prepare the shuttlebay for arrivals
they dont know our procedures so just
open the doors
ill take care of it sir
a beat you have the bridge
he turns and heads toward his ready room
the others watch him go with great sadness
when the ready room doors close behind picard deanna finally allows herself to cry
riker holds her closely
slow fade to
the senior crew is solemnly gathered in the shattered remains of the crew lounge
picard riker deanna beverly worf geordi
they wear their dress uniforms
picard goes to each of them
he carries a small metal box
they each take something from the box
at first we dont quite see what they are doing
then we realize they are affixing black bars to the collars of their uniforms
picard pours six glasses of his precious chateau picard
each takes a glass
picard raises his glass
to absent friends
they toast data
slow fade to
picard sits at his desk speaking quietly to someone we do not see
i dont know if all this has made sense to you but i wanted you to know what kind of man he was
in his quest to be more like us he helped show us what it means to be human
we see it is the now re activated b sitting across from him
my brother was not a human
no he wasnt
but his wonder and his curiosity about every facet of human life helped all of us see the best parts of ourselves
he embraced change
because he always wanted to be more than he was
i do not understand
well i hope someday you will
worf interrupts on comm captain the hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock
on my way
please notify commander riker
he stands prepares to go well talk later
the b does not respond
he is looking rather blankly at the padd on picards desk
picard begins to leave when a sound stops him
he turns back to the b
the b is still looking blankly at the padd
but hes humming lightly to himself
then he begins to sing very softly
blue skies smiling at me nothing but blue skies do i see
then the b is silent
picard watches him for a moment great emotion playing over his features and then goes
picard and riker head toward a turbolift
making their way past the debris littering the corridor
im sorry you wont be here for the re fit but i know the titan needs you immediately
riker does not respond
picard stops looks at riker deeply
the titans a fine ship will
and shes getting a captain worthy of her
shes the most beautiful ship ive ever seen
he touches a wall of the corridor but shes not the enterprise
i promise you in time shell become your home
if i could offer you one piece of advice
when your first officer insists that you cant go on away missions
ignore him smiles i intend to
with difficulty serving with you has been an honor
the honor was mine
a few weeks later
the enterprise is enclosed in the great womb of a spacedock
the ship is being rebuilt
a fresh faced young officer commander martin madden paces nervously outside picards ready room
bracing himself before entering
behind him we can see technicians working everywhere around the bridge trying to rebuild it
worf is talking to a young officer at tactical and geordi is working at the engineering station
we also see new command chairs being installed
although we do not see it in this scene the gaping hole at the front of the bridge has not yet been repaired
a young andorian woman the new ops officer smiles at maddens nervousness
her antennae twitch slightly in amusement
he sees her
whats the old man like
why dont you go in and find out
commander madden prepares himself
picard is talking to beverly on viewscreen
she is in her new office at starfleet medical
you cant imagine them jean luc
all with advance degrees in xenobiology and out to conquer every disease in the quadrant
smiles reminds me of a young doctor i used to know
theyre running me ragged
nothing but questions day and night
i love it
come to dinner and ill tell you all about it
theres a bajoran band at the officers mess
not tonight i have work here
ill save the last dance for you
commander madden enters quickly he did not use the door chime so picard is surprised
commander martin madden reporting for duty sir
picard stands they shake hands as welcome aboard commander
i hope your transfer didnt come as too much of a surprise
i needed you immediately to help oversee the re fit
gathering up some padds from his desk your service record on the talos is exemplary but there are a few things i would like to discuss with you regarding my
requirements for a first officer
shall we say dinner in my quarters at hours
very good sir
picard heads toward the door carrying a few padds
commander i dont know how they did it on the talos but we have door chimes on the enterprise
we use them
picard goes to the bridge madden following
they emerge to the bridge as worf is arguing with the cocky young ensign busy installing picards new high tech command chair
you dont understand the captain there should be no changes until we have discussed the modifications with him
picard goes to them whats this
grumbles your new chair sir
its the mark seven captain
state of the art ergonomics
command interfaces with i told him youre comfortable with your old chair
lets give it a try
he settles into his new command chair
looks around for a beat at his new bridge crew
fresh faced kids
a new generation to teach and nurture
worf and geordi exchange a look surprised
points try that button sir
picard presses a button on the chair and zip metal restraints fly into position around his waist and shoulders
picard is surprised
then picard smiles
its about time
he presses the button again and the restraints zip back into the body of the chair
he is delighted
he turns to madden commander please sit down
madden sits in the first officers chair picard shares a padd with him
weve received our first assignment
were going to be exploring the denab system
it should be exciting
its a place
where no one has gone before
and we cut to through the hole in the hull we see picard talking to madden
picard at work at peace
where he is meant to be
we slowly pull back from picard and the enterprise
as we hear the b s soft tones
never saw the sun shining so bright never saw things going so right
noticing the days hurrying by when youre in love my how they fly
blue days all of them gone nothing but blue skies from now on
we revolve away from the enterprise and earth toward the stars
then zoom forward into the cosmos as the rousing next generation theme explodes over end credits
