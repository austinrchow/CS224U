by stephen sommers the universal pictures globe spins
then comes to a stop on the african continent
a golden papyrus map of ancient egypt rises up
we push in on it towards a city along the nile its name written in hierarchic
we keep pushing in until the golden map turns to golden sand and we find ourselves descending on this ancient egyptian city
only its not ancient
superimposed across the screen are the words
accompanied by a narrator with a very thick egyptian accent thebes
city of the living
crown jewel of pharaoh seti the first
the camera sets down in an open plaza
an arabian horse drawn chariot comes barreling right at us driven by pharaoh seti an aristocratic virile old man
the chariot wipes frame
glaring out over the city at the setting sun is a handsome muscular man with intense evil eyes
this is imhotep
home of imhotep high priest of osiris keeper of the dead
a gorgeous olive skinned goddess enters the outer foyer
it takes us a moment to realize that the skin tight dress shes wearing isnt a dress at all but rather her entire naked body has been painted in the
ancient egyptian manner shes a stunning sight to behold
this is anck su namun
birthplace of anck su namun
no other man was allowed to touch her
she makes her way through the ornate statuary
the camera comes to a stop on a cracked stone face
and then its eyes suddenly pop open
its really a strange looking tattooed man
several more of these hideous bald men stand nearby
they are the priests of osiris
their eyes watch anck su namun vanish through the bedroom curtains
anck su namun embraces imhotep they kiss passionately feverishly
imhoteps hands roam over her perfect body smearing the paint
the narrators voice fills with lust but for our love we were willing to risk life itself
and we realize that the narrator is actually imhotep himself on the other side of the curtains the bald priests rush over and close the doors
but just as they do the doors suddenly burst open
pharaoh angrily strides in looks at the priests
the following dialogue is in ancient egyptian what are you doing here
the priests back away scared shitless obviously his arrival was unexpected
pharaoh strides for the curtains
throws them back
anck su namun stands alone
gives him a sexy smile
pharaoh sees the smeared body paint
points his finger
from behind him his sword is ripped out of its scabbard
pharaoh spins around
pharaoh is shocked
behind him anck su namun lifts a dagger and plunges it into his back
imhotep raises pharaohs sword
the hideous bald priests slam the doors and bolt them tight
through the curtains they see the shadows of anck su namun and imhotep stab away at pharaoh
suddenly the doors are rammed from the other side wham
imhotep and anck su namun turn and look
the doors are rammed again
the two lovers share desperate looks
the bald priests run up and grab imhotep and try and pull him towards the balcony
imhotep tries to break free but anck su namun rips pharaohs sword out of his hand and pushes him towards the balcony
you must go
only you can resurrect me
imhoteps face fills with despair
the doors explode open
men with blue tinted skin and strange puzzle tattoos over their bodies stride in armed to the teeth
these are the mumia
the priests hustle imhotep out onto the dark balcony just as the mumia rip through the curtains
anck su namun points at pharaoh and hisses my body is no longer his temple
she plunges the sword into her own heart
out on the balcony imhoteps mouth opens into a horrible silent scream
for murdering pharaoh anck su namuns body was to be cursed
and it was i the high priest whose duty it was to curse it
imhotep leads a torch lit procession across the dunes
anck su namuns mummy is carried by nubian slaves
they put her down in the sand along with five jewel encrusted jars
her body was mummified her vital organs removed and placed in sacred canopic jars
imhotep filled with dread reads from a obooko made out of pure gold
this is the book of the living
the book of the living contained sacred incantations that would send the evil dead on a journey into the dark underworld
strange light suddenly flashes across the faces of the slaves and the egyptian soldiers
suddenly everyones fear filled eyes all rise as if watching anck su namuns body rising
then one last huge flash accompanied by a blast of wind and its over
anck su namuns body now lies twisted on the ground
imhoteps priests place the body into a stone sarcophagus
the nubian slaves lower it into a hole and bury it with sand
imhotep then signals to the soldiers who throw their spears at the nubians
the slaves were killed
imhoteps knife wielding priests attack the now unarmed soldiers hacking at them in the flickering darkness as imhotep and the mumia solemnly watches
and the soldiers who killed them were also slain so that no unholy person should ever know the exact location of the burial site
the mumia walk off across the sand and then one by one the priests stop their frenzied stabbing and stare off at the vanishing mumia
as the last mumia disappears over a distant dune imhotep nods and the priests leap onto anck su namuns grave and begin digging it back up with their hands
chariots race out into the moonlit desert
imhotep leads the way
a hearse carries anck su namuns mummy
the map of ancient egypt fades up
the chariots race across the map
but there was another book the book of the dead which was never to be opened never to be read for it contained the incantations that could bring a dead
body back to life a most unholy thing
the chariots arrive at a place marked on the map in hieratic
they race up the stone ramp and in through the city gates
superimposed across the screen are the words hamunaptra city of the dead it was hidden at hamunaptra city of the dead inside the statue of anubis so that no such
sacrilege might ever disgrace egypt
imhotep pulls an ornate chest out of a secret compartment inside the giant statue of anubis
he opens the chest and lifts out the book of the dead made of black stone
but for my love of anck su namun i was willing to defy the gods
big hairy rats scurry through the mausoleums and over the headstones of this very large scary underground cemetery
a detritus moat surrounds the cemetery muck made out of filthy water and human remains
skulls bob in the goop
the priests have gathered in a circle
their hooded lifeless eyes seem dead to this world
their bald heads rock back and forth as they chant a quiet eerie hum
in the middle of the circle is a strange twisted altar
imhotep has unwrapped anck su namuns gorgeous lifeless body and placed her five sacred canopic jars around her
anck su namuns vital organs were still fresh so a human sacrifice would not need be made
as imhotep begins to read from the book of the dead a large swirling hole starts to open in the detritus bog
several priests look over at it frightened then quickly look back down and resume chanting
a strange mist wafts up out of the swirling hole and over to the jars it passes through them and into anck su namuns body
one of the jars shudders the heart inside begins to beat
the chanting priests swirling hole wafting mist beating heart and imhoteps readings are reaching a crescendo
anck su namuns eyes suddenly fly open
anck su namun soul had come back from the dead
now all that was needed was to return her organs to their rightful place within her body
imhotep lifts a sacrificial knife above anck su namuns breast about to plunge it down
the chanting swirling and beating heart climax
and thats when the mumia burst in and storm through the startled priests
the head mumia smashes the jar with the beating heart
the mist instantly sucks back out of anck su namuns body and implodes back into the swirling hole
anck su namuns eyes close
dying once again
imhotep screams in rage
the mumia grab him and his priests
my priests were condemned to be mummified alive
inside a torch lit chamber imhotep is held by anubis headed embalmers
he cringes at the flickering impressionistic glimpses of his priests being embalmed and mummified alive
the horrid looking embalmers using knives needles and thread calmly perform their ghastly surgery on the screaming priests who are going insane from the procedure
a red hot poker is pulled out of a pit of burning coals
a priests head is wedged between two strong boards
his eyes widen in terror as an embalmer moves to insert the red hot poker up his nose
but just before he does we quickly cut to imhoteps face horrified as off camera the priest screams
we go wide on the chamber
all twenty one of imhoteps priests squirm inside their wrappings
imhotep is forced to his knees
his arms are held back
his mouth is pried open
as for me i was condemned to endure the hom dai
the worst of all ancient curses
one so horrible it had never before been bestowed
using a pair of tongs an embalmer slowly pulls imhoteps tongue out of his mouth then places a very sharp knife on top of it
we go tight on imhoteps eyes as his tongue is apparently cut out
the embalmer flings imhoteps tongue onto the floor
the mumias dogs attack and quickly eat it
imhotep is wrapped alive
only his mouth nostrils and fearfilled eyes are left free of the slimy bandages
detritus muck boils inside a black cauldron
embalmers scoop out the fetid muck and apply it to imhoteps wrappings as he squirms
hes then laid in a wooden coffin inside a stone sarcophagus
an embalmer with a bucket steps up and looks into the coffin
imhoteps wild eyes stare back
the embalmer empties the bucket over imhoteps chest dozens of scarabs disgusting dung beetles
they scurry across imhoteps screaming face
some vanish into his tongue less mouth and up his nostrils
by eating the sacred scarabs i would be cursed to stay alive forever
and by eating me they were cursed just the same
the lid to the coffin is slammed shut
then using a strange four sided key the head mumia locks the coffin lid tight
the heavy sarcophagus lid is shoved into place and with a loud whoosh seals itself airtight
once again the head mumia uses the strange key locking the sarcophagus lid tight
i was to remain sealed inside my sarcophagus the undead for all of eternity
the blue skinned strangely tattooed man carefully collapses the sides of the key turning it into a little puzzle they would never allow me to be released
for i would arise a walking disease a plague upon mankind an unholy flesh eater with the strength of ages power over the sands and the glory of invincibility
imhoteps sarcophagus is dropped into a detritus pit
the disgusting muck splashes up drools down it s sides and then is mysteriously sucked into its seams vanishing clean
and if i could raise my beloved anck su namun from her place in hell together we would be an unstoppable infection upon this world
imhoteps horrifying tongue less screams can be heard coming from inside his sarcophagus as grave diggers shovel dirt onto it
the main title is superimposed on the scream the heavily armed mumia stand guard around imhoteps grave
looking down on the burial site is the huge statue of anubis the jackal headed god of death
it stares at us
then begins to decay before our very eyes aging years in only seconds
and then we find ourselves and the decrepit half buried statue of anubis out in the middle of the desert
imhoteps horrifying screams become the screams of a tuareg racing across the desert with two thousand of his warrior brethren
armed to the teeth
superimposed across the screen are the words a mile across the scorching desert two hundred french foreign legionnaires scurry through the ruins preparing for the onslaught
our hero is up on the wall
his kepi sits at a jaunty angle
dashing and handsome
this is rick oconnell
he looks out at the massive screaming horde galloping at him
i knew this was gonna be a lousy day
a doughy little frenchman joins him as he makes his way across the top of the wall
this is beni
personally i would like to surrender
why can we not just surrender
shut up and gimme your bandolier
beni pulls off his cartridge belt
hands it to oconnell
then lets run away
while we can still make it
oconnell throws it on crisscrossing his own bandolier
now gimme your revolver youll never use it anyway
beni pulls out his pistol and chucks it to oconnell
then lets play dead huh
nobody ever does that anymore
oconnell slides it into his belt next to his own revolver now go find me a big stick
in the desert
oconnell turns and goes nose to nose with him
so i can tie it to your back you appear to be without a spine
the horde of warriors thunders forward
now a half mile out
oconnell and beni run through the ruins
howd a guy like you end up in the legion anyways
i got caught robbing a synagogue
lots of good stuff in them holy places churches temples mosques and whos guarding them
i speak seven languages including hebrew so my specialty was synagogues
how about you
beni trips and accidentally tackles oconnell to the ground
oconnell gives him a nasty look
no but im considering it
they get up and run out the gate and down the stone ramp what then
none of the above thank you
then what the hell are you doing here
they both skid to a stop at the front line as they see the horde of warriors
the sound of charging horses is deafening
oconnell gives beni a big cheesy smile
i was just looking for a good time
and thats when the cowardly legionnaire colonel suddenly panics cuts and runs
oconnell instantly stiffens
gives the men around him courage
but onward comes the horde hoofs pounding the sand
several more legionnaires take off
to himself what the hell am i sayin
the tuaregs let loose with those horrifying oooo loo loog screams
more legionnaires haul ass
beni is one of them
to himself what the hell am i doin
the tuaregs set their rifles and take aim
oconnell steels himself cocks and locks
the cartridge in his mouth suddenly snaps he spits it into the sand
and then the legionnaires on the ground fire
the rifles report with a crash
the blast blows dozens of tuaregs clean off their mounts
the prone legionnaires quickly begin to reload
the kneeling legionnaires fire
more tuaregs bite the sand
the remaining warriors open fire
thunder and smoke rip the hot air
a third of the legionnaires are killed instantly
the remaining standing legionnaires fire
tuaregs spin off their mounts
crash to the sand
and then the entire tuareg force plows into the ruins and through the legionnaires
oconnell grabs the barrel of his rifle and starts clubbing riders off their steeds fighting like a man possessed
beni on the other hand is bellycrawling across the sand whimpering in full retreat as legionnaires fall dead all around him
he crawls through the front gate
oconnell throws his rifle down and goes for his guns
he cross draws gun in each hand starts blowing riders off their mounts
beni crawls faster and then he spots an open temple doorway amongst the rocks
he gets up and sprints for the door as the last of the legionnaires are shot off their feet behind him
oconnells guns go empty
son of a bitch
he turns and runs like hell right through the front gate
four tuareg warriors on massive arabians haul ass after him
oconnell hurdles a stone column hits the ground running
he spots beni inside the temple doorway trying to close the heavy sandstone door
beni has no intention of waiting up he pushes harder
what are ya doing
oconnell runs faster
beni pushes harder
the four horsemen leap the big column and charge after him
dont you close that door
dont you beni closes the door just as oconnell reaches it
oconnell slams his body into the door
it doesnt budge
im gonna get you for this
he turns and bolts off around the rocks
running for his life weaving through the ruins
the arabians getting closer and closer
the pounding hoofs getting louder and louder
oconnell finally spins around and faces his attackers
the four massive horses crash to a stop in front of him
the vicious tuaregs raise their rifles to finish him off
oconnell just stands there exhausted and beaten then he slowly lifts his right hand and gives them the bird
and thats when the horses go ape shit
all four of them rear up
two of the riders are thrown to the ground
the horses screech and bellow and snort in fear then buck like fury and haul ass away as if the devil himself had scared them
the thrown riders get up and race off after their mounts
oconnell just stands there stunned then he lifts his right hand and checks out his middle finger
and then he feels the evil himself and turns around
the shattered decrepit statue of anubis stares back at him
suddenly the sand begins to shift under oconnells feet
he starts to back away keeping his eyes on the transforming sand it looks like huge snakes are wiggling and writhing beneath it forming lines and shapes drawing a picture
oconnell quickly turns and runs off through the ruins
the sand stops moving and we can now see that drawn in the sand is a picture of imhoteps screaming face
up on a ridge a group of riders watch oconnell stumble clear of the decrepit city
oconnell feels their presence and looks up
very different from the tuaregs they have blue tinted skin and faces covered in strange puzzle tattoos
still watching imhoteps grave after all this time
the mumia leader is a huge fierce man in black robes with dual scimitars across his waist
his face is both handsome and horrible blue and tattooed
meet ardeth ray
his dark eyes watch oconnell stagger off into the open desert
cairo a city so old the stars have actually changed their positions in the sky since its birth
a city teeming with every form of life
a strange mysterious wonderful city
we superimpose its name across the screen deep in the bowels of the museum lie the stacks
rows upon rows of towering bookshelves
filled with literature on the antiquities
standing at the top of a tall ladder between two of these rows and leaning against one of the bookshelves is a rather uninteresting british girl eye glasses hair in
a bun long boring dress your typical prudish nightmare
this is evelyn carnarvon
were going to fall in love with her
evelyn pulls a book out from a stack under her arm blows the dust off it then places it on a shelf with other books whose titles all begin with
the letter o
then she grabs another book out from under her arm and reads the title
now how did you get up here
carefully so as not to lose her balance she looks over her shoulder to the bookshelf behind her where all the titles begin with the letter t
then she looks down
its a long way to the bottom
evelyn gently sets the other books down on the top shelf then turns and gingerly starts to reach across the aisle with the tuthmosis book
its a little too far so she stretches reaching holding the top of the ladder with her fingertips shes almost got it closer now closer
and thats when the ladder pulls away from the shelf
evelyn yelps flings the tuthmosis book and grabs the top of the ladder which stands straight up
evelyn holds her breath swaying precariously a long beat and then she loses her balance the ladder swings around and evelyn starts stiltwalking down the aisle
the ladder crosses the aisle does an about face and heads back the way it came
evelyn clings to the top struggling for balance
the ladder teeters out into the main aisle and picks up speed
evelyn screams as it does a spins into another aisle and finally crashes to a stop at the top of a bookshelf
evelyn holds her breath then sighs heavily
and thats when the bookshelf falls away from her and crashes into the next bookshelf
evelyn slides down the ladder and plops to the floor
she looks up just as the domino effect kicks in each bookshelf crashing into the next
and onward it goes
bookshelf after bookshelf
thousands of volumes flinging off shelves and scattering across the floor
it finally ends as the last shelf crashes into a wall
evelyns eyes are closed
she opens one eye
then opens the other eye and stares at the huge mess
the egyptian curator storms in
look at this
sons of the messiah
give me frogs flies locusts anything but this
compared to you the other plagues were a joy
evelyn quickly gets up and starts gathering books
im sorry it was an accident
when ramesses destroyed syria it was an accident
you are a catastrophe
why do i put up with you
evelyn turns to him trying to contain herself
you put up with me because i can read and write ancient egyptian decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic and im the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to
properly code and catalogue this library
who needs smart women
i put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons allah rest their souls
now straighten up this mess
the curator storms out
evelyn just stands there steaming
and then she hears a noise and quickly turns around
and then she hears it again like feet slowly shuffling across the floor coming from a nearby gallery
evelyn walks through the stacks and enters filled with treasures and plunder from the middle kingdom
its very dark and quiet in here the only light is from flickering torches at either end of the spooky gallery
the noise again
from the far side of the room
feet slowly shuffling plodding across the floor
evelyn grabs a torch
looks around at a statue of anubis another of horus they stare down at evelyn who is starting to get scared now
she walks down the aisle
past a closed sarcophagus
past cases of ancient artifacts
past another sarcophagus only this one is open
evelyn freezes swallows hard nervously looks around to see who could have opened it
then she slowly leans forward with the torch and peers inside
a hideous rotted mummy sits up and screeches at her
evelyn screams drops the torch and backs away scared out of her wits
and then coming from inside the sarcophagus she hears a man laughing
her eyes narrow as a foppish cad crawls out from behind the mummy laughing his ass off half drunk
please call me something original
meet jonathan carnarvon
as he crawls out of the sarcophagus evelyn pulls a cigarette out of the mummys mouth
have you no respect for the dead
right now i only wish to join them
he grins drunkenly
evelyn punches him hard in the chest
well i wish youd do it sooner rather than later before you ruin my career the way youve ruined yours
my dear sweet baby sister ill have you know that at this moment my career is on a high note
he belches then falls back and sits on the edge of a tomb
for five years youve been scrounging around egypt and what have you to show for it
jonathan excitedly starts scrounging around in his jacket
oh yes i do
i have something right here
oh no not another worthless trinket jonathan if i bring one more piece of junk to the curator to try and sell for you
jonathan pulls out a small ancient box the collapsed key to imhoteps sarcophagus and coffin
evelyn is instantly curious she grabs the box out of his hand
where did you get this
jonathan knows her weaknesses gives her a mischievous smile
on a dig down in thebes
evelyn rolls the box around in her hands mumbling to herself as she translates the hieratics and hieroglyphs covering it
jonathan licks his lips in anticipation
my whole life ive never found anything evy
tell me ive found something
evelyns fingers play with the various little slats on the box shifting them this way and that way its like a puzzle box
then suddenly it unfolds itself almost mechanically turning itself into the key
sitting inside the open key box is a folded piece of golden papyrus
an ancient map
i think you found something
the curator sits at his desk staring through a jewelers eyepiece at the key box
evelyn hovers behind him excited
see the cartouche there its the official royal seal of seti the first im sure of it
jonathan leans in from across the desk
who the hell is seti the first
and was he rich
he was the last pharaoh of the old kingdom said to be the wealthiest pharaoh of them all
alright good thats good
i like this fellow like him very much
the curator picks up the map
its actually the exact same map that we established in the opening scenes of the movie
ive already dated it this map is almost four thousand years old
and the hieratics over here
inhales deeply its hamunaptra
the curator freezes suddenly very nervous then he recovers
my dear girl dont be ridiculous we are scholars not treasure hunters
hamunaptra is a myth
are we talking about the hamunaptra
the city of the dead
where the early pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of egypt
right right in a big underground treasure chamber
everybody knows the story
the entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand
on pharaohs command a flick of the switch
and the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes
all we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around the curator holds the map closer to the burning candle lamp
as the americans would say its all fairy tales and hokum
the map accidentally catches on fire
the curator throws it to the floor
jonathan drops to his knees and quickly puts it out
lifts it up
the left third of the map is now missing
you burned it
you burned off the part with the lost city
its for the best im sure
many men have wasted their lives in the foolish pursuit of hamunaptra no one has ever found it most have never returned
devastated you killed my map
im sure it was a fake anyway im surprised at you miss carnarvon to be so fooled
the curator reaches for the key box
evelyn quickly snatches it off the desk and gives him a very angry suspicious look
one of the worst hell holes on earth
every low life form of scumbag can be found here
the warden a first rate scumbag himself escorts evelyn and jonathan across the gallows courtyard
evelyn whispers to jonathan
you told me you found it on a dig down in thebes
i was mistaken
you lied to me
i lie to everybody what makes you so special
im your sister
that just makes you more gullible
you stole it from a drunk at the local casbah
picked his pocket actually
the warden ushers evelyn and jonathan into the holding pen
and what is he in prison for
i did not know so when i heard you were coming i asked him that myself
and what did he say
he was just looking for a good time
the interior cell door bursts open
oconnell is in chains dragged by four guards they shove him up to the cell bars
from the looks of it hes been here awhile his face is half hidden by long hair a scraggly beard and many new bruises
evelyn looks at him disgusted by his appearance
but hes just a filthy criminal
cringing way to go evy
oconnell gives evelyn the once over then looks at jonathan
so whos the broad
shes my sister actually
im sure shes not a total loss
evelyn is stunned and furious
the warden heads out the door
ill be back in a moment
sarcastic i tremble with anticipation
a guard clubs oconnell across the head oconnells face bounces off the metal bars
he shows no pain but just looks back and gives the guard a nasty look
evelyn steps closer
your puzzle box and weve come to ask you about it
you came to ask me about hamunaptra
evelyn and jonathan quickly look around hoping the guards didnt hear him
they step closer
evelyn plays coy
how do you know the box pertains to hamunaptra
because thats where i found it
i was there
evelyn is dumbstruck
but jonathan looks suspicious how do we know thats not a load of pig swallow
oconnell looks closer at jonathan a glint of recognition
dont i know you
um well you see
oconnells fist comes flying through the bars hits jonathan square in the jaw decks him
he hits the floor
a guard clubs oconnell
his head bounces off the bars again
he shows no pain but gives the guard another nasty look
evelyn looks down at her brother then back at oconnell
you were actually at hamunaptra
i just decked your brother yes well
shrugs i know my brother
oconnell almost smiles
theres a bit of spark to this girl
yeah i was there
every damn day
no i mean i know what you mean
i was there alright
the city of the dead
what did you find
what did you see
i found sand
i saw death
the warden enters
evelyn quickly leans closer to oconnell
could you tell me how to get there
the exact location
want to know
evelyn leans in even closer
really want to know
she leans her face right up to the bars nervous and excited yes
oconnell steps forward and kisses her full on the lips
then get me the hell outta here
evelyn is stunned
a guard clubs him his face bounces off the bars again but before he can react the guards grab him yanks him away from the bars and drag him out
of the room
where are they taking him
to be hanged
evelyn is shocked
the warden shows off his green teeth
apparently he had a very good time
hundreds of filthy prisoners stare down onto the gallows as the hangmans noose is draped over oconnells head and cinched tight around his neck
evelyn follows the warden onto a balcony above the gallows
the prisoners all go dead quiet at the sight of her like jackals staring at fresh meat
no women allowed
i am an english woman
this seems to confuse the warden he shrugs and sits down
oconnell looks up as evelyn plops down beside the warden
i will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life
i would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang
two hundred pounds
three hundred pounds
oconnell can hear every word he looks hopeful
other than evelyn you could hear a pin drop
the hangman turns to him
any last requests pig
yeah id like ya to let me go
the hangman grabs the lever to the trapdoor
the warden sets his greasy lecherous hand on evelyns leg
and what else
evelyn is revolted she quickly shoves his hand away
insulted the warden angrily turns and gestures to the hangman who pulls the lever
the trapdoor drops away
oconnell drops through the hole
the rope pays out
then jerks taught
oconnells body snaps at the end of the rope
but hes still alive because his neck did not break
now we watch him strangle to death
the prisoners go ape shit screaming and shouting in anger
the guards look around nervous
oconnell struggles at the end of the rope gagging
evelyn is horrified she quickly turns to the warden leans forward and whispers in his ear
he knows the location to hamunaptra
the warden spins around and faces her
i would never
at the end of the rope oconnell is choking and gagging and turning several shades of red
the warden stares at evelyn
are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find the city of the dead
yes and if you cut him down we will give you ten percent
evelyn hesitates bites her lip
oconnells eyes bulge as he looks up at her he cant believe this girl
give him glaaaa twenty five percent and not one single farthing more
the warden flashes a big green smile then yells in arabic
a scimitar slashes the air
the rope is cut
oconnell crashes to the ground
all of the prisoners burst into cheers
oconnell looks up at evelyn
she smiles broadly and waves down at him
candle light flickers across the curators face
she must die
standing in the shadows across from his desk are three mumia blue tinted skin hideous facial tattoos the works
one of the mumia has a rusty metal hook for a hand
she is like all the others
she will die in the desert
she has seen too much
she knows too much
the curator leans across his desk fear in his eyes
not only does she have a map but she has the key
spooks the hell out of the mumia guys
she has the lost key
no one has ever had so much been so close
we must stop her or it will be the end of us all
then we will kill her we will kill her and all those with her
and burn the map and retrieve the key
it will be done
but what of the american expedition
they leave tomorrow as well
forget the bumbling americans they will be like all the others
without the map to guide them how can they possibly find hamunaptra
smash cut to our old traitorous friend beni
it is three days down the nile then two days by camel sahibs
we crane back to reveal beni standing on the bow of a passenger barge
surrounded by daniels henderson and burns
for all the money were paying you something better god damned well be under that sand
we keep craning back as henderson slaps daniels on the back
hamunaptra daniels thats all ya gotta keep sayin to yourself hamunaptra
now we see all of giza port team of explorers swarm the docks
across the nile the pyramids spike the sky
evelyn and jonathan walk along the boardwalk besieged by hawkers selling everything from toy tombs to king tut action figures
do you really think hell show up
undoubtedly i know the breed he may be a cowboy but his word is his word
personally i think hes filthy rude and a complete scoundrel
i dont like him one bit
anyone i know
they both turn
oconnell walks up shaved showered spit and polished with a new haircut and clothes
he looks more dashing and handsome than ever
evelyn is suitably impressed
jonathan grabs oconnells arm and shakes his hand
smashing day for the start of an adventure eh oconnell
oconnell quickly checks his pockets
yeah sure smashing
he finds his wallet and relaxes
directly above him on the bow of the barge burns wipes his bifocals and turns to beni
youre sure hamunaptra is out there
along with the scorched bones of my entire garrison sahib
and thats when beni spots oconnell
beni shakes his head as if seeing a mirage then starts backing away from the men
a thousand pardons my good sahibs but there is much work to be done
beni quickly scurries off vanishing down into the hold
back down with evelyn recovering she clears her throat
mister oconnell can you look me in the eye and guarantee me this is not some sort of flimflam
because if it is im warning you oconnell steps up close to evelyn invading her space looks her straight in the eye
evelyn doesnt back away
all i can tell you miss is that my colonel found that map in an ancient fortress and the whole damn garrison believed in it so much that without orders
we marched halfway across libya and into egypt to find that city
like i told ya all i saw was sand
everybody else was wiped out by tuareg warriors
ill take your bags
oconnell takes her bags and heads up the gangplank and onto the same passenger barge that beni and the americans are on
evelyns eyes follow him a bit wistfully
jonathan sees it
yes yes youre right filthy rude a complete scoundrel nothing to like there at all
evelyn gives him a look
jonathan just grins
and thats when the warden suddenly brushes past tipping his raggedy hat
a bright good morning to all
what are you doing here
i have come to protect my investment thank you very much
and up the plank he goes
evelyn and jonathan share a look
we go wide again as the barge pulls out and heads down the nile
we tilt up to the sun which then dissolves into the moon shining down on the desert
the three vicious mumia quietly glide a narrow skiff out onto the river
the one with the hook sits in the middle of the skiff the other two row heading for the passenger barge coming their way
jonathan and the three americans are playing poker
oconnell comes out a door carrying a gunny sack
sit down oconnell sit down we could use another good player
i only gamble with my life never my money
what if i were to wager five hundred dollars says we get to hamunaptra before you
oconnell returns daniels cocky look
burns slips on his dirty bifocals
what makes you so confident sir
what makes you
henderson spits a wad of chew into a spittoon
we got us a man whos actually been there
oconnells poker face drops perplexed
same with jonathan
i say what a coincidence why oconnell accidentally hits him in the ribs with the gunnysack shutting him up
jonathan quickly covers
whose deal is it
is it my deal
i thought i just dealt
evelyn sits on a table staring out over the passing river
the gunny sack drops onto the table startling her
sorry didnt mean to scare ya
the only thing that scares me mister oconnell are your manners
still angry that i kissed ya huh
if you call that a kiss
oconnell reaches into the gunny sack and starts pulling out revolvers pistols hunting knives a massive elephant gun and a half dozen carefully wrapped sticks of dynamite
did i miss something
are we going into battle
the last time i was at that place everybody i was with died
this takes the smile off evelyns face
oconnell starts dismantling and cleaning the guns
theres something out there you know something under that sand
yes im hoping to find a certain artifact a book actually my brother thinks theres treasure
what do you think is out there
oconnell looks into evelyns eyes
the tuaregs and the bedouin believe that hamunaptra is cursed they call it the doorway to hell
ahmar is ossirion
passageway to the underworld actually
she gives him a know it all grin
i dont believe in fairy tales and hokum mister oconnell but i do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there the book of
its what first interested me in egypt as a child
its why i came here sort of a lifes pursuit
and the fact that they say its made out of pure gold makes no nevermind to you right
evelyn is surprised by his knowledge
you know your history
i know my treasure
evelyn gets up to go then she hesitates nervous she turns back to oconnell and as matter of fact as possible says by the way
why did you kiss me
oconnell cleaning his guns just shrugs his shoulders
i was about to be hanged seemed like a good idea at the time
evelyns eyes widen furious she turns and storms off
oconnell looks up watching her leave a bit perplexed
whad i say
then he hears someone snickering under the table
he quickly reaches down grabs that someone and lifts him up
my very good friend
what a surprise
why if it aint my little buddy beni
i oughta kill you
oconnell sticks a knife under benis throat
beni swallows hard then tries to weasel his way out with a big grin
you never were any good with the ladies oconnell
so youre the one leading the americans i shoulda figured
so whats the scam
you get em out in the middle of the desert then leave em to rot
unfortunately no these americans are smart they pay me only half now half when i get them back to cairo so i must go all the way
oconnell pulls the knife away
beni relaxes rubs his neck
you never believed in hamunaptra oconnell
why are you going back
the devil himself lives out there
they look as they hear evelyn yelp
a single camel in the horse paddock takes another bite at her
she yelps again and backs away
oconnell grins as evelyn flees down the deck
the girl saved my life figured it was the least i could do keep her out of trouble
you always did have more balls than brains
oconnells eyes narrow at the insult he looks back at beni
lets make us even shall we
oconnell grabs him and chucks him over the side of the barge
beni splashes into the river
oconnell takes his gunny sack and starts walking off down the deck
i am going to kill you for this
and thats when he spots three sets of wet footprints coming up over the railing from the river and heading down the deck
oconnell quickly looks around immediately on the alert
evelyn wearing a nightgown stands in front of a mirror
she gives her head a good shake letting her hair fall loose over her bare shoulders
then she turns around right there is one of the hideous mumia
he slams his hand over her mouth and lifts up his hook ready to strike
where is the map
evelyns terrified eyes glance down
hook looks over sees the map lying next to a flickering candle on a nearby table
and the key
where is the key
evelyns eyes look confused
she shakes her head
then ill find it myself
he cocks his hook about to kill her
and thats when the door is kicked open
oconnell bursts in gun in each hand
hook spins evelyn around and holds her out in front of him
oconnell looks at her
friend of yours
evelyns eyes widen
and thats when the candle on the table flickers
everything happens at once read fast oconnell spins around just as a window bursts open
a mumia leans in
fires a gun
woodchips blast off the wall next to oconnells head
he returns fire
kills the mumia
the mumia falls back
a lantern in the room is blasted
kerosene splashes across the wall
bursts into flames
evelyn grabs the candle on the table and jams it back over her shoulder right into hooks eye
he screeches in pain and lets her go
oconnell grabs her and yanks her out of the flaming room
oconnell pulls evelyn down the hall she tries to jerk free
we need the map
he shoves her up against a wall
im the map
taps his forehead its all up here
oh thats comforting
oconnell gives her a look then pulls her forward
cmon theres still one more of those guys around here somewhere
hot melted wax covers hooks face as he holds his sore eye and struggles to the door
then he notices the key box on the floor
he bends over to pick it up
and thats when the door is kicked open again it hits him in the ass and knocks him into the fire
jonathan leans in
sees nothing but flames
then he sees the key box on the floor and picks it up
a hand suddenly snatches the key box away from him
hey thats mine its hook
his backside is now on fire
he lifts his pistol
jonathan quickly backpedals out the door as hook opens fire
oconnell and evelyn race out onto the deck near the horse paddock
people are screaming and shouting lots of panic
a chunk of the wall is blown off next to evelyns head
oconnell pivots and fires back
its the last mumia on the other side of the paddock
he and oconnell exchange gunfire
another lantern bursts into flames
oconnell shoots off the paddock lock
the horses go nuts
oconnell fires over their heads
they charge forward and crash through the door
the mumia screams as the horses stampede over him
flames sweep up the walls and race across the roof
half the barge is now on fire
oconnell throws the gunny sack over his shoulder
can you swim
well of course i can swim if the occasion calls for it
he picks her up and throws her over the side
the occasion calls for it
evelyn splashes into the water
oconnell dives in after her
jonathan runs out onto the bow sees the three americans guns in every hand fanning their pistols shooting everything in sight
jonathan just shakes his head
hook suddenly stumbles up behind him now a flaming torch
jonathan turns around hook grabs him by the throat with his flaming arm and pins him to the cabin wall
jonathans eyes widen as he sees a hook rising up inside the flames about to strike him
the americans pivot and open fire
blows hook over the railing
jonathan turns to the americans and smiles
then he points his thumb at himself and did i panic
he lifts up his other hand he has the key box back
i think not
and thats when the horses stampede onto the bow
jonathan dives over one side the three americans dive over the other
oconnell evelyn jonathan and the warden wade out of the water
evelyns nightgown clings tight to her body as she wrings it out
she looks good
everybody else including the horses is getting out on the far shore oconnell spots beni running up to the americans
looks to me like i got all the horses
looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river
beni looks up at the stars then angrily kicks the sand cursing
the flaming barge drifts off slowly sinking
oconnell barters in arabic with a camel trader at a trading post
jonathan forks over some cash
the trader hands them the reins of four ugly old camels
i cant believe the price of these fleabags
we coulda had em for free all we had to do was give em your sister
yes awfully tempting wasnt it
and thats when evelyn steps out of a trading tent
shes changed into a gorgeous tightly fitted bedouin dress
oconnell evelyn jonathan and the warden are on camels in the middle of the frying pan the endless sunbaked sahara
never did like camels
they smell they bite they spit
the warden savagely attacks a chicken wing with his vile green teeth
flies buzz around his head
he sucks at his gums then spits out some gristle
oconnell watches him
evelyn is having the time of her life on top of her camel
well i think theyre cute
we do several time dissolves showing the majesty of the desert and our heroes getting deeper and deeper into it
the moon shines down an four lone camel riders trekking across the vast wasteland
jonathan is sound asleep his head bobbing comically to the rhythm of his camel
on the camel next to him the warden snores loudly
up in front of them evelyn slowly starts to slide off her saddle
oconnell reaches over and stops her then gently pushes her back up onto her saddle never waking her
for a long moment his eyes watch evelyn and then he looks up at a distant ridge where ardeth ray and a group of mumia riders are pacing them
the dawning sun hasnt yet crested the distant horizon as jonathan and the warden ride alongside a giant sand dune
and you snore
i do not snore
all night you snored
i have never snored
up in front of them oconnell looks at evelyn
were almost there
are you sure
oconnell looks down at the ground
the others look down and see dozens of skeletons sticking out of the ground
bleached and eaten away
some of the skeletons look like theyre trying to crawl up out of the desert floor
what in bloody hell is this
the warden shivers in fear
other seekers of hamunaptra
the american expedition rides out from behind the far end of the dune
the americans are accompanied by two dozen native diggers and an arab egyptologist
beni rides lead on a camel the rest ride horses
good morning my friend
oconnell just nods
the two parties come to a stop a hundred feet apart
oconnell turns and stares out across the endless horizon
beni does likewise
the americans look puzzled
well what the hell we doin
patience my good sahib patience
henderson looks over at oconnell
first one to the city oconnell
oconnell and beni just stare out at the flat nothingness
evelyn and jonathan share a look
and then the sun starts to rise in the distance breaking the flat horizon
evelyn can feel the suspense and the majesty of the moment
were about to be shown the way
far off to the right a huge shape begins to rise with the sun
oconnell and beni watch it expressionless
daniels henderson and burns share a look and then the americans take off
racing towards the rising volcano
evelyn and jonathan give oconnell anxious sarcastic looks
ah begging your pardon but shouldnt we be going
after all you rode us night and day to win that bet
oconnell doesnt say a word staring hard
beni watches the americans and spits into the sand
and then suddenly the volcano shifts across the horizon
passing across the sun as it goes
its a mirage
the americans crash their horses to a stop and race the other way after the volcano
evelyn and jonathan smile amazed
the volcano shifts again floating across the watery horizon
the americans crash to a stop again and chase after the volcano
all three of them confused and cursing
oconnell and beni just stare waiting
the volcano shifts again
and the americans crash to a stop again
burns is thrown from his horse
henderson angrily rips his hat off and chucks it to the ground
daniels just curses as they give up the chase
the volcano comes to a stop on the far left of the horizon
the americans are on the far right
and then oconnell grins
so does beni
they share a look
and then swat their camels and race away
everybody else hauls ass after them
oconnell and beni are neck and neck
and then evelyn comes galloping up hair flying in the wind
beni takes out his camel whip and starts whipping oconnell
trying to knock him off his camel
but on the third try oconnell grabs the whip and jerks beni off his camel
beni slams to the ground and tumbles
evelyn and oconnell race across the desert
evelyn has never felt so alive
oconnell grins he likes this girl
beni stumbles to his feet then quickly dances out of the way as jonathan and all the other riders stampede past him
evelyn beats oconnell to the stone ramp racing hard
evelyn ignores him as she races up the ramp towards the gate
evelyn goes ass over teacups through the air and crash lands in a sand dune
she sits up stunned sandy hair in her eyes
oconnell stops at the edge of the ramp next to her camel
the americans ride up and look in wonder at the ruins inside the volcano
oconnell gives them a big shit eating grin
you boys owe me five hundred dollars
under the guidance of the egyptologist the diggers are busy hauling rock and dirt out of the temple doorway
the three americans are playing poker
beni smokes a hookah and swats flies
dozens of stray camels roam the decrepit city dusty backpacks and old saddlebags still slung over their humps
whered all these camels come from
they belong to the dead
they will wait years for their masters to return before leaving
oconnell evelyn jonathan and the warden are working next to a narrow crevice which weaves its way through the ruins
oconnell ties a rope around a pillar and throws the rest of the coils into the crevice about to rappel down
jonathan bends over to have a look his ass hits something he yelps and backs away
its the decrepit face of anubis
that thing gives me the creeps
that thing saved my life
evelyn is positioning ancient mirrors along the crevice
that thing gets me excited
sarcastic the things that get you excited
according to bembridge scholars inside the statue of anubis was a secret compartment perhaps containing the book of the living
what are those mirrors for
ancient egyptian trick
oconnell shrugs then rappels down into the crevice
oconnell waves a torch as jonathan evelyn and the warden drop down next to him
evelyn peers into the spooky darkness
do you realize we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years
i dont see no treasure
youre welcome to my share of the spider webs
and it stinks to high heaven in here
evelyn just rolls her eyes
jonathan sniffs the foul air then he looks at the warden and realizes where the smell is coming from
he stops sniffing
evelyn brushes cobwebs away from a metal disk on the wall then repositions it on its pedestal aiming it at a ray of light shining in from the outer mirrors
the ray of light rays shoot off down the passageways
its the embalmers chamber
that is a neat trick
oh my god its a preparation room
preparation for what
for entering the afterlife
oconnell quickly draws his gun
jonathan gently nudges him
mummies my good son this is where they made the mummies
evelyn heads down a narrow passageway
the others follow
oconnell evelyn and jonathan crouch as they make their way through a narrow cobweb infested labyrinth
the short squat warden can stand straight up
then they hear something and freeze
it sounds like somebody is clawing inside the walls
they share looks
then slowly move forward
getting darker and darker as they go
the strange sound getting louder and louder
and then it stops
evelyn holds her breath
jonathan licks his lips
oconnell cocks his pistol
the warden farts
oconnell jonathan and evelyn glare at him
they slowly creep out of the labyrinth and up to the foot of an enormous half buried statue
the lower half of anubis
then they hear the sound again coming closer now from the other side of the statue
oconnell pulls evelyn behind him
oconnell raises his gun
oconnell leaps out
three horrible sweaty faces lunge at him
but doesnt pull the trigger because its just the americans their guns are up cocked and aimed
ya scared the bejeezus out of us oconnell
but nobody lowers their guns
daniels grins the tough one
this here is our statue
dont see your name on it
and thats when beni five diggers and the egyptologist step out of the shadows all holding guns aimed at oconnell
ten to one oconnell your odds are no so good
ive had worse
jonathan clenches a tiny derringer
yes me too
oconnell gives him a sideways glance
beni cocks his gun grinning he wants it to happen
the tension thickens
then evelyn gently takes oconnells gun hand and pulls it down
lets be nice children if were going to play together we must learn to share
evelyn pulls oconnell away
jonathan and the warden follow
beni and the americans slowly lower their guns laughing
the egyptologist excitedly begins translating the hieroglyphs
oconnell and jonathan are using sledge hammers against the ceiling
evelyn is gently chipping away with a tiny chisel
according to my calculations we should be right under the statue
well come up right between his legs
she blushes and laughs oh my
and when those dirty yanks go to sleep looks at oconnell no offense
well sneak up and steal that book right out from under them
and youre sure you can find the secret compartment
yes if their egyptologist hasnt already found it
jonathan looks around
i say whats our smelly little friend got himself up to
the warden crawls into a dark chamber and lights a torch
a mural wall comes alive
embedded into it are dozens of black amethyst scarabs glittering images of the sacred beetles
awestruck the warden pulls out a pocket knife and starts prying away at one of the precious bugs
beni and the americans hover around the egyptologist whos found the secret compartment inside anubis
the egyptologist brushes sand away from the seam
henderson steps forward and grabs the seam the egyptologist quickly stops him
seti was no fool
henderson sees the intense look in the egyptologists eyes yeah sure
he looks back at the native diggers
well let him open it
the egyptologist nods then yells in egyptian at the diggers
the diggers hesitate filled with fear
daniels pulls out his gun aims it at three of the diggers
the three diggers hesitantly step forward with crowbars and stick them into the seams
the other diggers back away scared shitless
beni and the americans exchange looks and then they back away as well
three heroes are still digging into the ceiling lemme get this straight they stuck a sharp red hot poker up your nose cut your brain into small pieces then ripped
it all out through your nostrils
thats really got to hurt
its called mummification
youre dead when they do this still
yeah thatd bring you back to life
you two are worse than a couple of schoolboys
and thats when a huge chunk of the roof suddenly gives out
oconnell grabs evelyn and jerks her clear
jonathan dives for the far wall
a massive stone casement drops out of the ceiling and crashes to the floor
fills the room
having heard the crash beni and the americans have their guns pointed at the floor
the egyptologist could care less he looks at the diggers gripping their crowbars and yells the three diggers pull hard
the ancient seams start to give the egyptologist yells again
the diggers pull harder
the compartment starts to loosen
again he yells
the diggers give one final pull and the three diggers
melts their skin clean off
half skeletal by the time they hit the ground
the dust is starting to clear
oconnell evelyn and jonathan slowly get up and step over to the massive stone casement
we immediately recognize it as imhoteps sarcophagus
oh my god
it looks like it looks like a sarcophagus
why would they bury somebody in the ceiling
they didnt they buried him at the foot of anubis
he was either someone of great importance
or he did something very naughty
the warden drops an amethyst scarab into his pouch then greedily starts prying away at another
it rips off he drops it into his pouch only he misses and this scarab quietly falls to the sandy floor without the warden noticing
close on the scarab on the floor
it begins to transform
the amethyst starts to glow
something inside starts to wiggle as if the amethyst were some sort of strange cocoon
then it splits open and a real live hideous scarab beetle scurries out
it races over to the wardens shoe quickly burrows into the leather and vanishes inside
the wardens eyes fly open
he starts to scream drops his knife and frantically starts clawing away at his pant leg higher and higher until he rips open his shirt revealing a large hideous lump
burrowing under his skin
it burrows its way up his fat belly and across his hairy chest
the warden claws and scratches at it trying to stop it
the lump burrows up his neck
the warden starts gagging and and then the scarab lump vanishes into his head
our heroes clear the dirt off the top of the sarcophagus revealing a single ominous hieroglyph
evelyn stares at it jonathan impatiently strums his fingers across the lid
who is it
evelyn stares at the hieroglyph confused and concerned
he that shall not be named
oconnell dusts off the huge lock theres some sort of lock here
you say these things are made of granite with a steel interior
quarried granite with a cobalt lining
whoevers in here sure wasnt getting out
no kiddin without a key itll take us a month to crack this thing a key
thats what he was talking about
who was talking about what
evelyn starts rummaging through the pack on jonathans back
the man on the barge
the one with the hook he was looking for a key
evelyn pulls out the key box
jonathan tries to take it back
hey thats mine
evelyn slaps his hand and quickly unfolds the box its now shaped exactly like the locks keyhole
and thats when they hear the wardens screams echoing through the labyrinth
all three of them turn and take off running
the warden is screaming and dancing insanely around the labyrinth totally freaked from the extreme pain in his head
oconnell evelyn and jonathan run up just as the warden starts ripping his own hair out of his head
oconnell and jonathan grab at the wardens hands but hes far too crazed he shoves them aside runs full bore down the length of the labyrinth and slams his head
straight into a rock wall
the warden drops to the ground
dead as lead
eyes wide open
oconnell evelyn and jonathan just stand there staring breathing hard wide eyed themselves
evelyn and jonathan are nuzzled up to a campfire
what do you suppose killed him
did you ever see him eat
oconnell comes up over some rocks
seems the americans had a little misadventure of their own today three of their diggers were killed
pressurized salt acid
some sort of ancient booby trap
maybe this place really is cursed
a gust of wind blows through the camp
the campfire flickers oconnell and jonathan share a nervous look
you dont believe in curses huh
i believe if i can see it and i can touch it then its real
thats what i believe
oconnell cocks his rifle ka chank
gives her a big grin
i believe in being prepared
jonathan opens the wardens pouch the one that held the scarabs
he reaches in starts scrounging around
we slowly push in
waiting for the attack
the music builds
and then jonathan screams in pain and rips his hand back out of the pouch
oconnell and evelyn both jump
jonathan sucks his finger then reaches back into the pouch and pulls out a liquor bottle the top has been chipped off
jonathan smiles at the bottle then turns the pouch inside out and shakes it nothing but sand is inside it
well he may have been a stinky fellow
but he had good taste
jonathan takes a swig
oconnell and evelyn laugh guiltily and then oconnell suddenly kneels down and sticks his ear to the sand
evelyn and jonathan watch him
and then a barage of gunfire is heard coming from the american camp
oconnell jumps up and throws the elephant gun to evelyn
he takes off running through the ruins
evelyn immediately gets up and runs after him
jonathan grabs a gun holds the bottle of seagrams tight and dashes after her
but didnt the man just say
the american camp is under siege
two dozen mumia riders gallop through
several diggers are killed as they run
the americans leap out of their tents firing
kill multiple riders
daniels is shot spins and falls keeps shooting
henderson and burns run to his aid blasting away
oconnell races through the ruins and slams right into beni who is obviously trying to high tail it out of there
just looking for you oconnell
i wanted to be with my friend
oconnell drags him back towards the american camp
struggling why do you like to fight so much
cause i look good doin it
ardeth ray gallops through the camp cutting diggers down with his scimitar
oconnell runs up on top of some rocks leaps out and tackles him off his horse
the two men slam to the ground
oconnell spins up onto one knee and fires point blank
blows the scimitar out of ardeth rays hand
oconnell is about to shoot again when a horse rides up between them
a scimitar swoops down almost takes oconnells head off misses him by an inch
oconnell leaps up and blows the rider off his mount
the horse bolts
but ardeth ray is gone
evelyn hides behind some rocks watching the scene suddenly she hears something coming up behind her and spins around
a vicious tattooed mumia rider races at her
evelyn quickly backpedals over the rocks terrified
the mumia rider raises his scimitar about to strike
evelyn screams trips over a rock and fires the elephant gun blam
blows the rider off his mount and catapults him twenty feet back into some ruins
at the same time the kick blows evelyn off her feet and over a ridge
she flails through the air and lands in a sand dune
jonathan and some diggers are holding their own near the temple door
four riders come charging right at them
jonathan takes a swig off the seagrams
let em have it boys
jonathan and the diggers open fire
when the smoke clears the riders are either dead or gone
i say bloody good show
and then several more mumia leap off the temple and land behind them
jonathan and the remaining diggers spin around and suddenly find themselves in hand to hand combat
oconnell is quickly loading his pistol
he hears something thundering up behind him
he spins around just as ardeth ray on a horse swings his scimitar
oconnell instinctively raises his hands to protect his face the scimitar strikes
hits his gun ching
oconnells gun flips away
disarmed oconnell dives and rolls and suddenly comes up with a stick of dynamite in his hand
he shoves the fuse into a fire
he faces ardeth ray towering above him
the two men lock eyes
the fuse continues to burn down
ardeth ray points his scimitar at oconnells head
ardeth ray gallops off
the remaining mumia riders race after him vanishing into the night
oconnell watches them leave then turns to the burning fuse
and blows it out
evelyn staggers up looking very shaken
oconnell gently takes her and holds her close
evelyn looks up into his strong eyes
its the first time hes shown genuine concern for her
and she likes it
hes also holding her a little too close
and she likes that too
beni crawls out from under some pillars as henderson and burns help daniels to his feet
that proves it
old setis fortunes gotta be under this sand
for them to protect it like this you just know theres got to be treasure down there
oconnell looks up into the surrounding ridges unsatisfied
these men are a desert people
they value water not gold
evelyn looks at oconnell suddenly very worried
jonathan falls into frame
hits the ground
eyes wide open
and then his eyes close and his mouth widens into a goofy smile
shit faced drunk
oconnell and evelyn laugh both half in the bag themselves the bottle of seagrams is almost gone
oconnell offers the bottle to evelyn she waves it away slurring badly unlike my brother sir i know when to say no
oconnell polishes off the bottle and chucks it away
unlike your brother miss you i dont get
youre a whole new brew
i know youre wondering whats a place like me doing in a girl like this
something like that
egypt is in my blood
my father was a famous explorer he loved egypt so much that he married an egyptian
who was quite an adventurer herself okay i get your father i get your mother and i get your brother but what are you doing here
evelyn is insulted she staggers to her feet
i may not be an explorer or an adventurer or a treasure hunter or a gunfighter
mister oconnell but im proud of what i am
and what is that
evelyn plops back down beside him really drunk she grins and proudly lifts her head high
i am a librarian
she leans in very close to his face looks him in the eyes im going to kiss you mister oconnell
no youre not
not unless you call me rick
why would i do that
because thats my name
she gives him a goofy smile
he leans forward and kisses her
evelyns eyes slowly close
and then she passes out slumping into his arms
oconnell looks down at her and just smiles
evelyns hand slips the key into the sarcophagus lock and turns it
a series of strange mechanical like sounds are heard and then the sarcophagus unlocks with a giant hiss
oconnell evelyn and jonathan all look very very hungover
they start to slide the heavy lid off the sarcophagus
pushing shoving and groaning the lid budging inch by inch
i cant believe i allowed the two of you to get me drunk
dont blame me i dont even remember being there
well neither do i thank you
oconnell gives her a hurt look
evelyn gives oconnell a nervous look
gee yeah you told me it was the best time you ever had
oconnell gives her a big cheesy smile
evelyns face drops appalled and embarrassed
and thats when the lid falls off and loudly crashes to the ground
all three of them instantly grab their sore heads and moan
several fear filled sweaty faced diggers reach into the secret compartment
henderson and burns hold guns on them
daniels has his arm in a sling
the diggers slowly pull out the ornate chest
they set the chest down on the sandy floor
beni watches as the egyptologist translates the hieratics
there is a curse upon this chest
curse my ass
yeah who cares
the egyptologist gives them the evil eye in these hallowed grounds that which was set forth in ancient times is as strong today as it was then
yeah yeah okay whats it the egyptologist slowly and carefully reads the inscription death will come on swift wings to whomever opens this chest
a gust of wind blows through the chamber
torches flicker all the diggers suddenly turn tail and run off screaming
the americans look at each other suddenly very nervous
it says there is one the undead who if brought back to life is bound by sacred law to consummate this curse
yeah well lets just make sure we dont bring anybody back from the dead then huh
the three americans laugh
he will kill all who open this chest
and assimilate their organs and fluids
assimilate their organs and fluids
ya mean eat em
and in so doing he will regenerate
and no longer be the undead but a plague upon this earth
the wind whistles
beni and the egyptologist share a fear filled look
henderson just shrugs
ah hell lets open it anyways
imhoteps wooden coffin is dropped to the ground next to his stone sarcophagus
evelyn is very excited
oh my god ive dreamed about this ever since i was a little girl
you dream about dead guys
evelyn just gives him a look then starts brushing dirt and cobwebs off the top of the coffin
then she freezes
look all the sacred spells have been chiseled off
the hieratics and hieroglyphs that protect the deceased on his journey into the afterlife theyve been removed
this man was cursed
oconnell and jonathan are too excited to care
yes im all tears now lets see whos inside shall we
evelyn cant believe these guys
jonathan inserts the key box into the coffins lock
the lid cracks open with a hiss
they all react to the foul stench
then oconnell grabs the lid
he pulls with all his might
jonathan helps him
it starts to give way
and then it suddenly pops open and the most hideous maggot they all jump back
scared to death
imhotep is now the elephant man of corpses twisted and deformed
the years have not been kind
he slumps back into his coffin
henderson and daniels start to pry at the lid of the wooden chest
beni and the egyptologist watch
in the background beni starts backing away filled with fear sweating buckets
beware the curse
beni turns and bolts from the chamber
stupid superstitious bastard
and thats when the seal breaks a black vapor blasts out of the chest
everybody vanishes into the strange cloud
oconnell evelyn and jonathan slowly creep forward and carefully look back inside imhoteps coffin creeped out
is he supposed to look like that
ive never seen a mummy look like this
hes hes still
hes more than four thousand years old and still decomposing
and look at this
oconnell points at the inside of the coffin lid where there are fingernail scratches and dried blood all over the inside
oh my god he was buried alive
this sends a chill through everyone
evelyn leans in closer
and he left a message
we push in on a grouping of hieratics written in blood
it says death is only the beginning
oconnell looks around
wheres my gun
what are you going to do
if he decides to wake up hell yes
the vapor is settling
the americans have their guns aimed at the chest
the egyptologist slowly steps up reaches inside and lifts out a heavy burlap bag
everyones eyes widen in excitement as he sticks his hand into the bag and slowly pulls out the black book of the dead the same book imhotep used in his
attempt to bring anck su namun back to life
i have heard told of this book but i never truly believed it existed
this good gentlemen is a most priceless treasure
henderson kicks the sandy floor in anger
i wouldnt trade ya for a brass spittoon
its supposed to be made outta pure gold
daniels kicks the chest
it breaks open unfolding to reveal a lower compartment
inside are anck su namuns five jewel encrusted canopic jars one is shattered and without jewels the two camps have now joined together
oconnell and beni are roasting chunks of hairy meat over a fire
jonathan wrinkles his nose disgusted by the smell
what is this stuff
it smells like our late friend the warden
oconnell and beni both grin
jonathan looks horrified
you did not
they smell bad and taste worse but thats the best the desert has to offer
the gloating americans sit down fondling their jeweled jars
say oconnell whadaya think these honeysll fetch back home
we hear you gentlemen found yerselves a nice gooey mummy
ya know if ya dry him out you can sell him for firewood
the americans laugh
evelyn walks up sits down and drops a pile of big dusty bug skeletons onto the ground
scarabs flesh eaters i found them inside our friends coffin
they can stay alive for years living off the flesh of a corpse or in this case
she shrugs then looks at the roasting meat famished
oconnell and jonathan stare at the bug skeletons disgusted
are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy and they slowly ate him alive
he certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him
must of got a little too frisky with the pharaohs daughter
according to my readings our friend suffered the hom dai the worst of all ancient egyptian curses one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers
in all of my research ive never read of this curse actually having been performed
that bad huh
yes they never used it because they feared it so
its written that if a victim of the hom dai should ever arise he would bring with him the ten plagues of egypt
the ten plagues
you mean all ten plagues
like what that moses guy did to that pharaoh guy
thats one way of putting it
lets see there was frogs flies locusts
hail and fire
the sun turning black
water turning to blood
and my personal favorite people covered in boils and sores
all the men share nervous looks really spooked
evelyn just laughs at them then pulls a meat stick out of the fire
fried gizzard anyone
having just freshened up for bed evelyn exits the temple and steps past the sleeping diggers
she spots the egyptologist his jeweled canopic jar snug under one arm the book of the dead laying loose under the other
evelyn stares at the book nervously biting her lip then she sneaks over carefully steals it and quickly tip toes away
lying on some blankets by the campfire oconnell rolls over and sees evelyn sitting wide eyed staring at the book
you sure you outta be playin around with that
its just a book no harm ever came from a book
evelyn opens the cover
the fire flickers
she and oconnell share a nervous look then evelyn shrugs and starts reading
ahm kum ra
ahm kum dei
evelyn continues reading the book aloud in ancient egyptian
evelyns voice is overlaid as we start wide on imhoteps chamber and slowly push in on his sarcophagus
we push in over the lip of the coffin then closer and closer towards imhoteps rotten twisted head until his putrid face fills frame and then suddenly his crusty eyelids
revealing empty sockets
big scary music sting
the egyptologist sits bolt upright
quickly looks around sees evelyn reading the book
he gets up and runs for her
he skids to a stop as a strange piercing whine is heard coming from out in the desert
oconnell and the others all leap to their feet
the americans run out of their tents
the sound gets louder and closer
and then from out of the darkness a huge wall of locusts swirls into camp and envelops everyone
oconnell grabs evelyn and with jonathan at their side they race for the crevice trying to fend off the horrid vermin as they go
beni and the americans run for the temple
the egyptologist is covered in locusts
he stares at the book of the dead looking haunted
what have we done
the campfire is sucked up into the air oconnell evelyn and jonathan race down the labyrinth slapping at themselves and picking locusts out of their hair did you see that
billions of grasshoppers
thats one of the plagues right
the grasshopper plague
this is not a plague
every so many years the locusts of egypt have a population explosion and they all take flight
evelyn steps forward something squishes
oconnell lowers his torch the entire floor is filled with slimy frogs
and what about frogs
the americans beni and the diggers race into a passageway
burns is knocked down his bifocals skitter across the ground they get crushed in the stampede
burns staggers to his feet squinting
blurry figures vanish into the darkness daniels
the ground under oconnell evelyn and jonathan starts to shake
then suddenly right in front of them hundreds of chittering scarab beetles boil up out of the sand
start scurrying towards them
even oconnell almost screams
they turn around and haul ass
burns staggers down a passageway squinting his hands out in front of him groping trying not to bump into anything
then ten feet in front of him a dark blurry figure steps out
is that you
burns half blindly staggers forward
the figure doesnt move
burns trips stumbles forward towards the figure his hands reach out and sink into imhoteps putrid chest cavity
burns jumps like a scalded cat pulls his hands out and looks at them his hands are covered in molten flesh rot
he starts to scream
a skeletal hand clamps over his mouth
oconnell evelyn and jonathan race up the staircase just ahead of the mass of scurrying chittering scarabs
oconnell leaps out onto a pedestal
jonathan jumps up next to him
evelyn jumps up into a grotto on the other side of the narrow stairway
the horrible herd of vicious scarabs scurries between them their ear piercing chitters send shivers up evelyns spine
she leans back
the wall moves
evelyn falls backwards through an opening
oconnell and jonathan watch the scarabs vanish up the staircase
then they look across the way
evelyn is gone
evelyn sits up shakes the sand out of her hair fearfully looks around
its almost pitch black
she gets up and feels her way along the dark walls
she rounds a corner
a shaft of moonlight filters in through a crack in the ceiling
a man stands in the middle of the room
evelyn walks towards him
oh thank goodness youre one of the americans arent you
just as she reaches him he turns around
both of his eyes are missing
he stares at her with vacant sockets
evelyn screams in horror and backs away hyperventilating she bumps into something
she screams again and spins around its imhotep
with two fresh eyeballs in his sockets
evelyn screams again and backs away into a wall
her hair is down her face is dirty and sweaty her blouse is ripped her dress is torn shes never looked sexier
anck su namun
oconnell is feeling his way around inside the grotto damn it
must be a trap door around here or somethin
and then they heat men screaming and suddenly henderson daniels and one of the diggers come running down the stairs
oconnell and jonathan join them as they hear the herd of chittering scarabs coming their way
the digger suddenly trips and falls
oconnell slows down about to go back and help him
but its too late
the digger screams in horror as the herd of scarabs run over him eating straight through him leaving behind the diggers half eaten skeleton
daniels henderson and jonathan react in horror
oconnells already running races right past them
the others turn and haul ass
imhotep steps forward the sand around him seems to magnetize swirling and dancing around his flaking skeletal legs
evelyn starts backing away horrified looks at burns help me
burns opens his mouth but can only gurgle and moan because his tongue is missing
imhotep grabs him throws him to the ground and sets his skeletal foot on burns chest like a big game hunter standing on his kill
imhotep then parts his fetid lips a fresh tongue flaps between his rotted teeth
kadeesh pharos anck su namun
evelyn shivers in fear
suddenly oconnell comes flying around the corner and runs right up to her
would you quit playin around
lets get outta here already
oconnell sees the look in her eyes and turns around at the sight of imhotep oconnell jumps back in fright
oconnell and evelyn start backing away down the wall
imhotep glides sideways with them like a tiger cornering his prey the sand around him swirls and dances
burns starts to crawl away whimpering as he goes
imhotep suddenly stops and unhinges his skeletal jaw his skinless mouth stretches to an inhuman size and he lets out a horrific primordial evelyn screams
oconnell shudders then embarrassed by his fear he opens his own mouth and roars right back at him ahhhhhhhh
then blasts him with the elephant gun blam
through the smoke and flammage we see imhotep blown off his feet his ribcage half torn away
oconnell grabs evelyn and runs
sand and wind whip through the ruins as oconnell and evelyn stumble up out of the crevice and come face to face with ten armed mumia
the mumia quickly raise their guns
oconnell and evelyn quickly raise their hands
jonathan henderson daniels and the egyptologist are already on their knees hands over their heads
ardeth ray steps forward
i told you to leave or die you refused and now you may have killed us all
for you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years
relax i got him
no mortal weapons can kill this creature
he is not of this world
are we talkin about the same creature
the walking corpse
really big mouth
really bad breath
beni slowly backs up around anubis eyes wide gun up
he turns around imhotep is right there
beni screams backs away and opens fire
six gunshots perforate imhotep but have no effect except to splatter molten flesh rot onto the back wall
beni retreats into a corner scared shitless
imhotep moves forward his one hand trying to stop the molten mummy guts from oozing out of the large shotgun hole in his side
beni drops his gun and grabs at the chains around his neck religious symbols and icons dangle from each chain
beni holds the first one up a christian crucifix
he quickly makes the sign of the cross and blesses himself in english may the good lord protect and watch over me as a shepherd watches over his flock
and may satan in all his forms be vanquished forever
it has no effect on imhotep who continues forward
beni quickly grabs at the other symbols and icons holding them out towards imhotep one after the other trying to slow his progress an islamic sword and crescent moon necklace
a hindu brahma medallion a small buddhist bodhisattva statue
all while blessing himself in arabic hindi chinese and latin
imhoteps skeletal hand reaches for benis throat
tears run down benis cheeks hes so freaked
and thats when he holds up the star of david and blesses himself in hebrew
imhotep stops in his tracks
his hand lowers
his grotesque new eyeballs stare at beni
subtitled the language of the slaves
looks at him quizzically
imhotep takes a step back
in hebrew subtitled i may have use for you
and the rewards will be great
imhotep reaches into his tattered robe and then holds out his fetid hand filled with squirming maggots
beni cringes about to throw up but then the maggots part revealing a tiny pile of little jewels
benis eyes widen
imhotep raises his other hand it holds anck su namuns broken canopic jar
where are the other sacred jars
several mumia drag burns up he stares out with vacant sockets
daniels and henderson are especially horrified
what did you do to him
we saved him
saved him before the creature could finish his work
now leave all of you quickly before he finishes you all
youre not going to kill us
evelyn elbows jonathan in the ribs
we must now hunt him down and try and find a way to kill him before he consumes the earth
allah be with us
ardeth ray and the mumia start heading down into the crevice
oconnell yells at them trying to convince himself
i told ya i already got him
ardeth ray stops and looks back deadly serious
know this the creature will be coming for you
he must consummate the curse
and until he does he will never eat he will never sleep and he will never stop
ardeth ray turns and jumps down into the crevice oconnell and jonathan boost evelyn up onto a camel
daniels and henderson throw burns up onto another
the egyptologist still clutching the book of the dead gets up on yet another
they all head off into the dark windblown desert
and then in the extreme foreground a skeletal hand suddenly a british flag flies over british soldiers manning the front gate
our tired disheveled heroes saunter up on their dusty camels
the soldiers check their papers then let them enter
a steamer trunk is slammed to the floor and thrown open
oconnell chucks a load of dresses into the trunk
i thought you didnt believe in this stuff
oconnell heads for the closet
evelyn unpacks the dresses having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking talking corpse tends to convert one
forget it were out the door down the hall and gone
no we are not
oconnell throws a handful of her underthings into the trunk
oh yes we are
oconnell continues to pack evelyns clothes as she continues to unpack them no we are not
we woke him up and we must try and stop him
you didnt read that book
i told you not to play around with that thing
alright then me i
i read the book i woke him up and i intend to stop him
oconnell angrily stretches a bra between his hands
you heard the man no mortal weapons can kill this guy
evelyn grabs the bra and throws it into a drawer
then well have to find some immortal ones
there goes that belief again
not me i am outta here
oconnell stuffs a pile of evelyns shoes into the trunk
evelyn kicks the lid shut slamming it on his fingers
oconnell yelps and angrily storms around the room sucking his fingers as evelyn follows him
according to that book once this creature has been reborn his curse will spread and as he grows in strength so will his curse grow infecting the people until the
whole of the earth is destroyed
is that my problem
incredulous its everybodys problem
look lady i appreciate you saving my life and all but when i signed on i agreed to take you out there and bring you back and i did now
were even end of job end of story contract terminated
thats what i am to you
you can either tag along with me or you can stay here and play around with mister maggot
oconnell storms out and slams the door
then the door opens and oconnells hand reaches back in and throws a handful of frilly panties to the floor
slam goes the door
oconnell angrily strides through the compound
he sees beni coming up the path with a man dressed in hooded robes his face covered by an ornate death mask
beni ya little stinkweed where did you slink off to
you left me
you left me in the desert to rot
sorry bout that
gestures to imhotep so whos this guy
this is prince imhotep high priest of osiris
oh hey how ya doin
oconnell sticks out his hand imhotep instantly recoils oconnell gives him the once over
beni quickly covers
the prince does not like to be touched by other humans
a silly eastern superstition im afraid
yeah well we all got our little problems today dont we
he has come to help mister burns
somehow i feel responsible
dont gimme that you never had any scruples
do you know where i can steal some
oconnell fake punches him
oconnell gives imhotep a look as he strides off
see ya around padre
imhoteps grotesque new eyes glare out from behind the mask
the proverbial den of iniquity
hard men hard women and hard liquor
lots of deals going down
an older guy with a walrus mustache is drunk and talking to some tough customers
he wears british wwi fighter pilot gear
meet winston havlock
im the last of the royal force still stationed here you know
all the other laddies died in the air and were buried in the sand
the tough customers shove him away
winston staggers over to oconnell and jonathan at the bar not missing a beat
ever since the end of the great war there hasnt been a single challenge worthy of a man like me
ive heard it before winston
oconnell shoves him away
winston staggers back to jonathan
i just wish i wouldve chucked it with the other laddies gone down in a flame of glory instead of sitting around here rotting from boredom and booze
jonathan shoves him towards another group of unlucky sods henderson and daniels sidle up to the bar next to them
burns now tongue less talks with a severe impediment
the drawer there spectacles
tries to laugh as you see i wont be needing them
imhotep opens the drawer and pulls out some bifocals
he puts the bifocals on over his death mask and grins broadly his rotted teeth showing through the mouth hole
mister burns prince imhotep thanks you for your spectacles and for your eyes
and for your tongue
the expression on burns face starts to change very puzzled
but i am afraid more is needed the prince says he must finish the job consummate the curse which you and your friends have brought down upon yourselves
a look of pure fear registers on burns face
beni quickly backs away and runs out of the room
imhotep picks up the sacred canopic jar then removes the death mask revealing his hideous shattered corpse skull
three shot glasses clink together
oconnell jonathan and henderson slug em down all three of them instantly spit out the liquid
half the bar spits out their drinks as well
that tasted just like
they all look at each other even more nervous
and the rivers and waters of egypt went red and were as blood
a look passes over oconnells face a realization
he suddenly jumps away from the bar and runs for the door
lightning flashes as oconnell races across the compound knocking several soldiers out of his way panic stricken
evelyn calmly steps into a courtyard carrying a handful of books
a blast of thunder and lightning scares her
she drops half the books
then a hand grabs her
she jumps again and drops the rest of the books
its oconnell breathing hard
we got problems
and thats when a barrage of hail and fire slams into the courtyard
oconnell and evelyn jump back
a water fountain bursts into steam
a wooden trellis catches fire
oconnell and evelyn run under the eaves as soldiers servants and camels run in every direction trying to avoid the maelstrom
i saw him
that thing is here
are you sure
oconnell gives her an incredulous look and gestures at the hail and fire
the hail and fire come to a stop
everything goes dead quiet
oconnell and evelyn freeze
and then a blood curdling scream is heard coming from the living quarters directly above them
oconnell and evelyn race up the stairs
oconnell and evelyn race into the room past the servant who is running out screaming
they skid to a stop as they spot burns or whats left of him lying dead on the floor drained of all organs and liquids
oconnell and evelyn are shocked
then they hear a loud moan and notice imhotep standing on the far side of the room
oconnell draws his gun
imhotep is regenerating a thick skin forms over powerful new musculature
his tendons ripple
his bones bulge and reform
his mouth opens to an inhuman size as he moans and cries out in severe pain
and then its over
and he looks like an incredibly muscular corpse like vision from hell
the terminator mummy
oconnell and evelyn are stunned
we are in serious trouble
imhotep starts to move towards them staring at evelyn
back off creep
imhotep keeps coming
oconnell opens fire
blasting imhotep bullets rip through his body
imhotep doesnt seem to mind
jonathan henderson and daniels run into the room
theyre all stunned at the sight of imhotep
oconnell steps forward throws a right hook punches imhotep in the face his fist goes through imhoteps skull and gets stuck deep inside his head
oconnell stares at it shocked then quickly yanks his fist back out
the area of imhoteps face that came into contact with oconnells fist quickly degenerates and decays right down to the bone as if oconnells hand instantly infected it
imhotep angrily turns grabs oconnell and with no effort throws him across the room and into jonathan and the others knocking them down
imhotep looks at his hand the one that just grabbed oconnell it starts to shrivel and decay
he quickly turns to evelyn
evelyn backs away into a wall terrorized
imhotep steps up to her
you saved me from the undead
for this i shall make you immortal
he leans in about to kiss her with his decayed face
and thats when a white cat jumps onto the piano hissing
the balcony doors blow open
imhotep spins into a blast of wind and sand and swirls out the doors
oconnell evelyn jonathan and daniels stand transfixed
henderson kneels next to burns shriveled body horrified
oconnell jonathan henderson and daniels follow evelyn across the ramesseum
theres only one person i know who can possibly give us some answers
they round a corner and come upon the curator who is talking with ardeth ray
oconnell and the americans quickly draw their guns
ardeth ray just scowls
the curator nods his head
what is he doing here
do you truly wish to know
or would you prefer to just shoot us
everybody tenses guns up
then oconnell uncocks his
i just saw my fist vanish into some guys head
he slides his gun back into his shoulder holster
im willin to go on a little faith here
you will not believe it
everyone is assembled around the tomb display of seti the first
we recognize his chariot and sword
the curator sits on setis throne
we are part of an ancient secret society the cult of the mumia and we have a sacred mission passed down through thirty nine generations
for over four thousand years we have guarded the city of the dead
we are sworn at manhood to do any and all in our power to stop the high priest imhotep from being reborn into this world
and because of you we have failed
appalled and you think this justifies killing innocent people
to have stopped this creature
okay lets cut to the chase
hes afraid of cats whats that about
according to the ancients cats are the guardians at the gates of the underworld
imhotep will fear them until he is fully regenerated and then he will fear nothing
daniels is totally wigged out he looks at oconnell
and ya know how he gets fully regenerated
by killing everybody who opened that chest and sucking us dry
yes the creature must first try and regenerate and then he will attempt to resurrect the one he has loved for more than four thousand years
anck su namun
the curator and ardeth ray look at evelyn thunderstruck
in the necropolis when i saw him alive
walking he called me anck su namun
and then in mister burns quarters he tried to kiss me
it is because it was you who read from the book
he has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of anck su namun
jonathan scratches his ear with the barrel of his pistol
this is not good
not good at all
ardeth ray has been staring out a wall of windows
tonight is the full moon
the moon of osiris
it will begin tonight
everyone follows ardeth rays eyes through the windows we can see the sun which is now going into a full eclipse
and he stretched forth his hands towards the heavens and there was darkness throughout the land of egypt
oconnell looks out a window at the british soldiers manning the walls
above and beyond them is the black sun
evelyn and jonathan are pacing the foyer we must stop him from regenerating
she turns to daniels and henderson
who opened that chest
well there was me and daniels here and then poor burns of course oh yeah and that egyptologist fella
oconnell turns from the window
what about my buddy beni
naw he scrammed outta there we must find the egyptologist and bring him back here to the safety of the fort before the creature can get to him
oconnell looks at evelyn daniels and henderson
evelyn you wait here you two come with me
all three of them pounce on him at once the hell with that
im not goin nowhere
were safe here
yeah im not leavin this fort for nothin
who put you in charge
you cant just leave me behind like some old suitcase
im the one responsible for this mess and i intend to be the one to clean it up
oconnell just shakes his head and sighs
totally put upon
then he takes evelyn shoves her into the bedroom slams the door and locks it with a skeleton key
from inside her room we can hear evelyn pounding on the door and yelling
oconnell throws the skeleton key to daniels
keep an eye on her
if you leave her door ill rip your spleen out
jonathan swallows hard and points to himself
the egyptologist stumbles through the dark alleys looking haunted
he clutches the book of the dead in one hand and his sacred canopic jar in the other
imhotep is stalking him
a street vendor turns and sees imhoteps horribly decayed face
he reacts and scurries away
imhotep lifts his robe covers his face and moves in on the egyptologist who is heading into the bazaar
we pan up to beni is ransacking the joint pulling out drawers and files and throwing them on the floor
he finds a silver pocket watch shakes it then throws it into his pocket then he starts tipping over bookcases and clearing shelves
well well well
beni spins around
oconnell and jonathan stand in the door
lemme guess spring cleaning
beni turns and runs for an open window
oconnell grabs a chair flings it into his path
beni trips and crashes into a wall
oconnell strides over grabs him and lifts him up the wall
benis feet dangle off the floor
wheres your new friend
youre my only friend
oconnell quickly slides his knife up under benis chin
then you got no excuse for living
what the hell you doin being buddies with this creep beni
whats in it for you
it is better to be the right hand of the devil
than in his path
as long as i serve him i am immune
immune from what
you shall see
what are you looking for
lie and ill slit your throat
oconnell shoves the knife deeper into benis skin
the black book they found at hamunaptra
imhotep wants it back
said to me it would be worth its weight in diamonds
what does he want the book for
shrugs something about bringing his dead girly friend back to life
he needs the book
looks at jonathan and your sister
oconnell looks at jonathan
beni seizes the moment and knees oconnell in the balls
oconnell doubles over and collapses
beni leaps out the window
that looked rather painful
wincing ya know ever since i met you my luck has been for crap
yes i know i do that to people
and thats when they hear a blood curdling scream coming from down in the bazaar
oconnell and jonathan scramble to the window and look out down in the bazaar people are screaming and quickly backing away from the shriveled corpse of the egyptologist
a partially decayed hand reaches down and takes the sacred canopic jar out of the egyptologists shriveled hand
its imhotep having regenerated even further
he looks up and catches eyes with oconnell
imhotep grins then unhinges his jaw his mouth stretches to an inhuman size and then a huge swarm of flies comes out of his mouth and races straight up at
oconnell and jonathan
they both slam the shutters
the flies slam into the closed window and immediately spread throughout the bazaar
sending people screaming and running
oconnell and jonathan look at each other panicked
thats two down and only two to go
and then hell be coming after evy
they turn and race out of the office
daniels stares out a window watching the british guards at the front gate
more soldiers march the encircling parapet
all is well
the lights and music from the casbah come up from below daniels turns from the window
henderson sits in a chair next to evelyns door chain smoking
both look wired with fear
the hell with this
im goin downstairs to get me a drink
you want somethin
yeah get me a glass of bourbon a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser
daniels nods and heads out
henderson just sits there alone smoking
he reaches into his jacket pocket pulls out his sacred canopic jar and fondles it
a breeze suddenly comes in through the open window
the curtains flutter
henderson gets up and goes over to shut it
he looks out the window
the camera races over the compound into the window and hits henderson square in the face just as hes about to scream
henderson is lifted into the air by a mass of swirling sand
his body twists and turns and slowly shrivels as the life is sucked out of him
then he collapses to the floor
on the wall above him the shadow of the swirling sand condenses forming a shadow of a human body
the shadow convulses as the body regenerates
and then its over
imhotep steps into view
hes regenerated even further and looks almost normal now his face no longer decayed
he steps over hendersons shriveled body and up to evelyns door rattles the knob
evelyn is asleep in her bed as sand begins streaming in through the keyhole pouring onto the floor forming a large mound
evelyn starts to toss and turn
we pan back over to the door the mound of sand is gone and in its place is imhotep
oconnell and jonathan race into the foyer and skid to a stop as they see hendersons shriveled body on the floor
oconnell runs up to evelyns door and rattles the knob still locked
he bends down and looks in through the keyhole
imhotep leans down towards evelyn about to kiss her as she sleeps
the door starts to crash and bang from oconnell
imhotep ignores it
and kisses evelyn
his lips and mouth instantly start to degenerate and decay
right down to the bone
the door bursts open
evelyn wakes up
sees imhoteps rotted mouth kissing her
she screams and shoves him away
imhoteps putrid mouth grimaces in sadness
get your hands off my girl pal
imhoteps sadness turns to anger as he spins around and faces oconnell
imhotep licks his fetid lips
imhotep starts to move for oconnell
i figured you might be here so i brought a friend
he throws the white cat at imhotep
imhotep instinctively catches it
he shrieks drops the cat and stumbles back towards the window which suddenly blows open
imhotep spins like a dervish and bursts into a whirlwind of sand
everybody covers their eyes
the imhotep sand devil explodes out the window and vanishes over the compound
jonathan aims his gun at the window his hand shaking badly
oconnell hugs evelyn as she wipes her mouth in disgust
daniels walks in looks at hendersons shriveled body on the floor
and drops the martini glasses
jonathan races his big convertible through the streets honking constantly
evelyn sits between him and oconnell looking scared and nervous then she gives oconnell a look
you called me your girl
oh yeah that was just um you know figure a speech
i think you were jealous jealous
you kiddin me
did you see that guys face
daniels leans forward from the back seat filled with fear shut up
just shut up
we gotta do somethin
we gotta do somethin now
before its too late
they race into the driveway of the museum of antiquities
a full moon now shines down on the bazaar still bustling with activity
suddenly a breeze kicks in
green mist begins to swirl down the street and through the stalls
the people begin to choke and cough and retch as if being hit by a severe sickness its already too late
imhotep strolls through the sickened mob his face half rotted off his deformed mouth grinning happily
beni is at his side looking very nervous
and then one by one the people silently begin to follow imhotep their skin now covered in disgustingly hideous boils oconnell
jonathan daniels the curator and ardeth ray follow evelyn as she strides through the museum
last month i came across an inscription that mentioned the book of the dead
that book we found at hamunaptra
i dismissed it because it talked about bringing people back from the dead
a notion i was unwilling to believe
believe it sister
thats what brought our buddy back to life
and now hes going to use it to bring his girlfriend back and if he succeeds the two of them together will bring about the apocalypse
the curator joins evelyn at her side as she heads up the stairs everyone else in hot pursuit
the plagues we have seen so far are merely imhotep flexing his muscles
only at the moment of anck su namuns resurrection will he be truly invincible
they reach the display cases
evelyn quickly opens them
im thinking that if the black book of the dead can bring people back to life then perhaps the golden book of the living can return them to the underworld
exactly so your sayin if we find the book made outta gold and read the sacred incantations contained inside it
you think itll send this guy back to hell
correct and thats when loud chanting is heard coming from outside
they all rush over to the upper windows and look down outside a large crazed mob covered in hideous boils and sores comes chanting up the driveway anck su namun
anck su namun
it has begun
the beginning of the end
not quite yet it hasnt
evelyn dashes back to the display cases
the crazed mob crashes into the huge front doors which are locked
they pound furiously throwing themselves at it while chanting constantly
imhotep solemnly comes up the driveway
the banging on the doors can be heard as evelyn and the curator quickly sort through broken pieces of stone tablets
the others watch
evelyn pulls out a large piece
the banging gets louder
multiple windows shatter
evelyn talks while quickly translating the tablet since the black book of the dead was found inside the statue of anubis then according to this the golden book of the
living should be inside
evelyn finds the translation in the tablet and smiles
the golden book of the living is inside the statue of horus
which would be located not far to the east of the anubis statue
dont tell me we gotta go back out there
if we want to kill the creature yes
two hideous boil sore covered men charge out of a doorway screaming
oconnell and ardeth ray grab them and chuck them over the railing
the men fly through the air and crash into the lower display cases
the front doors suddenly burst open the crazed mob pours into the museum
our heroes haul ass across the balcony and down the staircase
jonathan sneaks out of some bushes and quickly heads for his convertible
suddenly a splinter group of the diseased mob comes around the side of the museum
jonathan instantly bugs his eyes out starts drooling and begins chanting anck su namun
anck su namun
the crazed group runs past him and heads into the front doors of the museum
jonathan leaps into the convertible fires it up and s it back over to the bushes
oconnell evelyn daniels ardeth ray and the curator jump inside the car
beni steps out of the museum and sees them
imhotep looks out of the museum from the shattered upper windows just as the convertible peels out
oconnell points a finger at beni as they race past him
youre gonna get yours pal
imhotep unhinges his jaw his mouth stretches to an inhuman size he lets out one of his horrific primordial shrieks
his disease ridden disciples immediately begin pouring out of the front doors of the museum and chasing after the car
the convertible hauls ass down the narrow bazaar street
crazies start jumping out of stalls and leaping onto the car
oconnell and the others fight them off throwing them overboard
more people jump on
jonathan swerves the car crashes through some stalls knocking them off but not before they manage to open the back door and yank daniels out
he tumbles across the pavement
gets up shooting
backs into a corner firing his pistol into the hideous rabble killing several keeping them at bay
his gun goes empty click
but the mob stays back looking at him like rabid vultures
daniels eyes them filled with fear
the mob parts like the red sea as imhotep walks through them and up to daniels
daniels whimpers in fear tears pour down his cheeks
then he gets an idea reaches into his pocket and pulls out his jewel encrusted sacred canopic jar
he holds it out for imhotep
imhotep takes it and grins
through his tears daniels grins back hopeful that hell be spared
we cut wide somewhere in the middle of the crazed diseased mob we hear daniels give out a blood curdling scream
the convertible slowly motors down the narrow alleys
we dolly across the hood of the car from jonathan to evelyn to oconnell
ardeth ray and the curator are still in the back
all of them staring out the front windshield
then suddenly one of the hideous ghouls crashes through the windshield
jonathan hits the gas loses control the car slams into a wall
oconnell grabs evelyn
they all leap out of the car
but the angry festering mob quickly surrounds them
oconnell quickly reaches into his gunny sack pulls out a stick of dynamite then reaches into his pocket and pulls out a match
he looks around for a way to light it then reaches over and strikes it across ardeth rays stubbly face
ardeth ray yelps
oconnell holds the lit match near the fuse
the crazed chanting mob gives oconnell a wide berth staring at him and the others with insane bloodshot eyes
and then imhotep steps through having fully regenerated he now looks as young and handsome and muscular as he did the day he was buried alive
evelyn stares at him
oconnell gives her a look the match burns his fingers
he yelps and throws it down grabs another match and strikes it across ardeth rays face again
ardeth ray yelps and gives oconnell a look to kill
the curator shakes his head
he has consummated the curse now all he need do is raise anck su namun from the dead then it will be the end of us and the beginning for
imhotep moves forward heading right for them
oconnell lights the fuse
imhotep steps up to oconnell and stops watching the fuse burn down
its a game of chicken
the tension mounts
the lit fuse is about to vanish inside the stick of dynamite blowing it up when evelyn leans forward and blows it out
oconnell exhales but keeps his eyes on imhotep who extends his hand to evelyn
koontash dai na
beni steps through the swarming mass translating
take his hand and he will spare the others
evelyn hesitates looks around at the huge bloodthirsty crowd surrounding them holding axes picks and scimitars waiting to pounce then she looks at imhotep confident powerful invincible
then she looks at oconnell
any bright ideas
oconnell talks through angry grit teeth
sorry fresh out
evelyn looks back at imhotep then starts to reach out to take his hand
both oconnell and jonathan move to stop her but ardeth ray grabs them both and holds them tight
dont do it evelyn
i have no choice
evelyns trembling hand touches imhoteps his hand closes around hers
keetah mi pharos aja nilo isirlan
come with me my princess
it is time to make you mine forever
evelyn gives beni a nasty look correcting him all eternity idiot
then she looks at oconnell and puts on her best face
you better think of something because if he turns me into a mummy youre the first one im coming after
oconnell almost smiles
got guts lady
yes i know and id like to keep them
imhotep suddenly notices something
he reaches forward and hey thats mine
ardeth ray holds jonathan back
imhotep pulls evelyn away
oconnell cant take it anymore he tries to break free of ardeth rays grip
the huge powerful man holds him tight
there is still time
we can stop him yet
the crowd parts for imhotep and evelyn
and then imhotep stops and looks back at oconnell
imhotep pulls her away
oconnell breaks free of ardeth rays grip and stumbles forward
but the rabid vultures are already moving in for the kill
oconnell quickly bends down pulls open a cistern manhole cover and shoves jonathan down inside it then jumps in after him
the curator pushes ardeth ray towards the cistern hole
find a way
kill the creature
the curator turns and throws himself at the mob as ardeth ray crawls down into the hole
the mob tears the curator apart
oconnell jonathan and ardeth ray slosh their way down the watery catacomb crazies pouring in behind them
up ahead a light suddenly shines in from another cistern hole and then more of the infected crowd drop down screeching like rats
oconnell jags right pushing jonathan and ardeth ray ahead of him he strikes a match off the wall lights the nubby fuse on a stick of dynamite throws it and
runs like hell
fire blast incinerates a bunch of crazies
the explosion blows a cistern cover fifty feet into the air followed by a mass of flammage
a sewer grate is kicked out of a wall
oconnell jonathan and ardeth ray climb out of the hole and into an alley
we gotta get her back
im with you old man
no one touches my sister like that and gets away with it
oconnell looks at ardeth ray
you know where hes taking her
to perform the ritual
jonathan looks worried
and what ritual would that be
the ritual to bring the body of anck su namun back to life
and how does one do that
by reading the book of the dead
oh yes of course
and then killing your sister
ardeth ray looks at oconnell
imhotep is now able to cross the desert with great haste
jonathan taps him in the shoulder
begging your pardon but i wasnt quite clear on that last part
ardeth ray ignores him
if he arrives before us it will be too late
did you say kill my sister
i know how to beat him to it
and on that we smash cut to the erfoud dunes dawn jonathans bashed in convertible steams its way up to a set of semi abandoned quonset huts
a single wwi biplane with r
insignias sits in the sand beside them
a sign reads oconnell jonathan and ardeth ray stand before winston havlock the massive dunes of erfoud as our background
so whats your little problem got to do with his majestys royal air corp
not a god damned thing
winston looks intrigued
is it dangerous
you probably wont live through it
this really interests him
by jove do you really think so
everybody else weve bumped into has died why not you
winston nods his head hes hooked
so whats the challenge then
to save the damsel in distress kill the bad guy and steal his treasure
a slow grin spreads across winstons face then he gives them a snappy salute
winston havlock at your service sir
way off across the desert a large sand devil races over the dunes
the sandy whirlwind comes to a stop and starts to dissipate
evelyn and beni are suddenly ejected out of it they land in a dune
the swirling sand condenses and forms into imhotep
he looks up into the sky listening carefully
evelyn shakes the sand out of her hair and looks at beni
what just happened
all i remember is him turning into a blast of sand
and then i remember nothing
then they hear a plane in the sky and look up
the wind whips at winston in the cockpit
oconnell sits in the gunners compartment
jonathan is strapped spread eagle across the left wing ardeth ray is tied tight to the right
both men are scared out of their wits and screaming in fear
imhoteps jaw unhinges his mouth opens to an inhuman size he lets fly with another one of his horrible shrieks
and a massive wall of sand rises up out of the desert oconnell watches the desert below him come alive and rise up towards the plane
winston looks over the side and sees whats coming
he laughs throws the throttle and puts the plane into a dive
hang on men
we go wide as the sandstorm chases the diving twisting biplane
getting closer and closer about to engulf it
oconnell looks back into the blinding sand and sees a giant face forming inside the sandstorm
oconnell grabs the lewis machine gun cocks the bracket and fires blasting away at imhoteps giant face inside the sandstorm
imhoteps face begins to laugh then his jaw unhinges his mouth opens wide and he engulfs the plane
winston blindly fights for control elated
were going down
the biplane spins inside the blowing sand
jonathan and ardeth ray screaming
winston havlock laughing
here i come laddies
oconnell braces himself for impact evelyn leaps to her feet and runs over to imhotep
youll kill them
imhotep grabs her pulls her close her beautiful eyes stare into his shockingly intense ones
then he kisses her hard
evelyns eyes widen stunned and mesmerized then she pushes herself away and falls back into the sand
the biplane smashes over a dune rolls over and crashes upside down into another dune
the sand swirls as oconnell falls out of the gunners compartment
the left wing is jammed into the dune jonathan hangs upside down
a little help would be useful
if its not too much oconnell goes to help jonathan
ardeth ray stumbles over to the gunners compartment and tears the lewis gun off its mount
he throws the machine gun over one shoulder a cartridge belt over the other and staggers away
oconnell and jonathan look into the cockpit
winston havlock is dead
a smile on his face
the plane suddenly starts to move the sand sinks under their feet they quickly high tail it away
oconnell jonathan and ardeth ray make it to some rocks and look back
the biplane with winston havlock inside slides away over a dune
oconnell gives it a salute
the plane vanishes over the dune and into the swirling sand
oconnell jonathan and ardeth ray come down a ravine in the volcano and look out over the ruins of hamunaptra
okay now what the hell does this horus guy look like
hes a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon
carrying torches oconnell jonathan and ardeth ray make their way down a long winding narrow staircase
heading into the bowels of the necropolis
a passageway to hell
evelyn follows imhotep into the underground cemetery
she stops at the sight of all the big hairy rats scurrying through the mausoleums and over the gravestones
beni shoves his rifle into her back and pushes her forward
evelyn gives him a look
you know nasty little fellows such as yourself always get their comeuppance
beni suddenly looks worried
oh yes always
beni looks even more worried he nervously starts chewing on his lip
all three of them walk over the bridge crossing the disgusting detritus moat
evelyn looks down at it horrified
oconnell and ardeth ray are busy digging out a collapsed doorway
jonathan notices an amethyst scarab on the far wall
i say look at that
he walks over and tries to jiggle it free
it comes loose in his hand
he looks at the scarab in his palm
it starts to glow
and then something inside it starts to wiggle
you should come have a look at this
the wiggling continues a long agonizing beat and then the scarab breaks out of its cocoon and instantly burrows into jonathans palm
jonathan starts to freak out and scream
oconnell runs up and rips the arm off jonathans shirt
the scarab is now burrowing up jonathans arm
oconnell whips out his butterfly knife snaps it open and grabs jonathans arm
jonathans eyes widen in terror as the knife passes in front of his face
jonathan screams louder obviously being cut open
oconnells hand flicks something away
the scarab hits the floor and immediately starts scurrying back towards jonathan wanting to finish the job
oconnell pulls out his gun and blows it away blam
the gunshot echoes into the cemetery as imhotep evelyn and beni step up to the strange altar where four thousand years ago imhotep tried to bring anck su namun back
imhotep scowls at the sound and angrily reaches into a canopic jar
he pulls out the crusted remains of anck su namuns heart crushes it to dust in his hand and starts reading from the book of the dead
then he blows the dust against a mausoleum wall the wall starts to come alive
evelyn and beni stare at the wall both of them wide eyed
two forms emerge from the mausoleums wall
horrific looking mummified corpses
two of imhoteps long dead priests
they bow to imhotep then turn and move off down a passageway
oconnell helps ardeth ray mend jonathans wound
from now on dont touch anything
not a damn thing
keep your hands off the furniture got it
jonathan swallows hard and nods vigorously
imhotep prepares the altar while speaking in hebrew
beni holds his gun on her translating prince imhotep wants your heart
evelyn blushes feeling complimented by the handsome prince
tell him im truly flattered
but that its already taken
imhotep continues speaking while laying the four jewel encrusted canopic jars next to the shattered one
he wants your heart and your brain your liver your kidneys
evelyns eyes widen
and how do you say
those slimy things in your stomach
evelyn cant believe it she furiously turns to imhotep
you only want me for my organs
imhotep looks at her and grins then backhands her wap
evelyn goes down for the count
imhotep stares at her cold malevolent then he turns and walks off into the mausoleums
beni nervously glances around then quickly scurries away
oconnell squeezes through a small crevice in a wall and drops to the floor of a dark chamber
he picks up his gunnysack and scans the darkness
jonathan and ardeth ray crawl in behind him
oconnell notices a shaft of light high above him shooting through a small hole in the ceiling and stopping against a wall next to one of those mirror disks
oconnell aims his gun
the bullet strikes the disks pedestal spinning the mirror into the shaft of light and wham
the shaft its an enormous treasure chamber
filled to overflowing
everything sparkles and shines
the wealth of egypt
oconnell jonathan and ardeth ray are speechless
thats when the two mummified priest mummies walk in
who the hell are these guys
oconnell pulls the elephant gun out of his gunny sack
i never killed a priest before
they are evil cursed they matter not
well okay then
oconnell fires the elephant gun
smoke and flame shoot out
blasts one of the mummies
blows its upper torso clean off
oconnell pumps the gun the huge spent cartridge flips through the air
he fires again
blasts the other mummy blows this ones torso clean off as well
the smoke clears
the two sets of legs keep walking forward unaffected by the loss of their upper torsos
oconnell cant believe it
oh come on gimme a break here
and then the disemboweled upper torsos start to move turning over and crawling towards our heroes who start to back away
imhotep turns from the altar as he hears more gunshots echoing out of the passageways
he angrily reaches into another of anck su namuns canopic jars pulls out her crusty liver and crushes it to dust then quickly starts reading a passage from the book
and blows the dust down a passageway
ancient egyptian subtitled kill them
kill them all
and bring me the book of the living
a dusty breeze blows into the chamber as oconnell jonathan and ardeth ray back away from the mummy pieces
the floor where they were just standing suddenly starts to move
two more mummies slowly dig their way up out of the floor
more mummies start coming out of the walls and crawling out of the piles of gold
all the mummies head for our heroes
oconnell lifts the elephant gun
ardeth ray stops him
ardeth ray opens up with the lewis gun
blasting the shit out of the mummies
they keep on coming
even more now
oconnell opens fire with the elephant gun pumping and firing as all three of the men back away and haul ass
the mummies and mummy pieces follow them into the passageway
then beni creeps into the chamber
he stares in wonder at all the treasure
then falls backwards into a pile of jewels and rolls about
evelyn wakes up lying chained to the top of the altar
she blinks then turns her head and looks right into the rotted face of anck su namuns corpse
the elephant gun fires blasting flame and smoke right into the lens
oconnell jonathan and ardeth ray race down a passageway a dozen mummies striding after them
this whole place is comin alive
the men race around a corner
they race around another corner
onward they come
boxing in our heroes
oconnell and ardeth ray firing as they go
ardeth ray goes empty
he throws the machine gun down and they all race into a small chamber
the lower half of the giant statue of horus stands in the middle of the chamber
there he is
they run up to the base of the statue hello horus old boy
oconnell looks back at the mummies coming down the passageway
he reaches into his gunny sack and pulls out a stick of dynamite
ardeth ray taps him on the shoulder
oconnell hands him the dynamite and a match then turns to look at the statue
ardeth ray reaches forward and strikes the match off oconnells stubbly face
ardeth ray lights the dynamite and throws it down the passageway
they all hit the deck
the dynamite explodes
ripping apart the creatures causing a cave in and sealing the passageway with rock and dirt
now theres only one way out another dark creepy passageway
chained tight to the top of the altar evelyn hopelessly struggles to free herself
she stops as priest mummies start surrounding the altar
evelyn is horrified as the hideous mummies kneel down and begin to chant which now sounds even more horrific due to the lack of tongues jaws and mouths in the
imhotep steps up carrying the black book of the dead
his hand reaches out and lovingly caresses anck su namuns decayed cheek
oconnell and jonathan are digging away at the seams of the secret compartment it starts to give
and thats when ardeth ray spots another group of rotting mummies coming down the dark passageway heading right for them
oconnell looks up
these guys just dont quit
ardeth ray grabs the elephant gun and a handful of shells and runs off towards the mummies
oconnell and jonathan redouble their efforts pulling harder on the seam
the compartment starts to loosen
about to give
the last time this happened salt acid sprayed out remember
our heroes keep tugging
the tension mounts
and thats when a skeletal hand bursts up out of the ground and grabs oconnells ankle
several more moldy hands burst up out of the ground
oconnell and jonathan struggle with the mummies as they crawl up out of the dirt floor
one of the mummies violently shoves oconnell away
another grabs jonathan by the throat and starts to strangle him
a third mummy grabs at the secret compartment and pulls hard
three of the mummies
the one strangling jonathan gets it in the back and drops him
all three mummies melt horribly
imhotep begins to read from the book of the dead
a large swirling hole starts to open in the detritus bog
evelyns eyes widen in amazement and horror
ardeth ray blasts away at the oncoming mummies
over at the base of the statue oconnell and jonathan pull an ornate chest out of the secret compartment
oconnell rips off the lid reaches inside and pulls out a heavy burlap bag
he and jonathan exchange nervous excited looks
then he reaches into the bag and slowly pulls out the solid gold book of the living golden light reflects off their faces as they stare at it in wonder
the elephant gun goes empty
ardeth ray takes it by the barrel and wades into the remaining mummies swinging
save the girl
kill the creature
the mummies quickly overwhelm and start to tear him apart
oconnell lights the last stick of dynamite and throws it against the far wall
he and jonathan hit the deck
thats the last one we better get lucky
the wall blows
debris collapses but now heres a hole for them to get out
oconnell and jonathan race out through the hole just as the remaining mummies enter the chamber
outside beni staggers across the sand with a saddlebag filled with treasure
he throws it over the rear of a camel
starts to climb up
looks back at the temple door
licks his lips
and then his greed gets the better of him and he quickly climbs down and scurries back towards the door
imhotep reads from the book
the rotten priest mummies rock back and forth chanting
then suddenly the strange mist wafts up out of the swirling hole and over to the sacred jars it passes through them and into evelyn
evelyn jerks as though shes been electrified
the mist passes through her and into anck su namuns body
the chanting priests swirling hole wafting mist and imhoteps readings reach a crescendo
anck su namuns crusty eyelids suddenly pop open
evelyn stares at her in disbelief
anck su namuns rotted head turns and looks at evelyn with empty sockets
evelyn freaks out and struggles wildly then she notices imhotep holding the ancient sacrificial knife
with your death my love and i will be invincible
he raises it up over evelyns chest about to plunge it down
evelyns eyes widen in horror
and thats when oconnell and jonathan burst in
imhotep spins around and faces them
jonathan beams as he holds up the golden book of the living
i found it evy
i found it shut up and get me off of here
oconnell grabs an ancient sword out of a statues hand jumps up onto a gravestone and leaps out over the priests
the priest mummies stop chanting
the mist vanishes
imhotep steps forward
oconnell strikes the sacrificial knife out of his hand
imhotep bellows a command
the priests stand up swords and knives in hand they attack oconnell
open the book jonathan
open the book
thats the only way to kill him
oconnell racks and chops at the attacking priest mummies fighting his way to evelyn
the skeletal creatures wildly swing their swords trying to stab oconnell
jonathan fumbles with the book struggling to open it he cant
i cant open it
its locked or something
oconnell cuts two of the mummies in half then swings his sword down at evelyn clang
one chain breaks free
jonathan spots a series of solid gold four sided locks along the binder
it hits him like lightning we need the key
imhotep grins then grabs the key box hanging from a chain around his neck rips it off and shoves it into his pocket he picks up the sacrificial sword and
heads for jonathan
what do i do evy
what do i do
read the inscription on the cover
oconnell swings his sword down again clang
evelyn now has one hand and one leg free
more mummies attack oconnell force him back
jonathan quickly starts translating the cover inscription but his ancient egyptian is clearly awful
keetash something naraba something
jonathan starts to backpedal through the cemetery clutching the golden book wide eyed as imhotep moves in on him
ebarra im hatu kashka ummmmm
jonathan trips and falls on his ass
imhotep charges forward
oconnell slashes another chain
only one more left holding evelyn
jonathan sits up and quickly looks back at the cover
rasheem aaaaa anubis
imhotep raises the sacrificial sword about to kill jonathan
and thats when the giant statue of anubis suddenly crashes through the wall shades of ray harryhausen
the god of deaths horrible decrepit stone face stares angrily down
jonathan stares back
oconnell decapitates a mummy and looks up at anubis
this just keeps gettin better and better
imhotep leaves jonathan and heads for the giant statue
oconnell leaps over and with one last swing of the sword frees evelyn from her chains
more priest mummies attack forcing him away
evelyn jumps off the altar and starts to head for oconnell a skeletal hand grabs her
spins her around
its anck su namuns rotted corpse
imhotep looks up at anubis points to oconnell and in ancient egyptian commands him to attack
anubis moves for oconnell stomping over mausoleums and through the detritus moat on his way
oconnell quickly backs away
do something jonathan
you have got to be joking
evelyn is backing away from anck su namun
finish the inscription idiot
anck su namun attacks evelyn
evelyn fends her off as best she can
jonathan quickly looks back at the hieroglyphs on the book cover fumbling badly under the pressure ummm hootash im
hootash im now what is this last symbol here
whats it look like
anck su namun grabs evelyn by the throat
the statue of anubis corners oconnell reaches down and grabs him with its massive talons
oconnell hacks away at it
jonathan stares at the inscription slightly oblivious
its an anck symbol with two little squiggly lines above it and a bird a stork
on either side
evelyn is being strangled by anck su namun
the talons lift oconnell up and start to crush him
hootash im ahmenophus
the giant statue of anubis instantly freezes in its tracks and petrifies
its off balance
starts to fall
oconnell slides free of its talons
evelyn shoves anck su namun away anck su namun looks up and opens her fetid mouth to scream just as anubis crashes down on top of her smashing her to
powder and driving her into the ground
imhotep shrieks in rage and horror then turns and angrily heads for jonathan
jonathan sitting on his ass quickly backpedals on his hands and heels
oconnell leaps to his feet sword in hand and runs for imhotep
imhotep grabs jonathan lifts him up rips the golden book of the living out of his hand and pins him to a wall
oconnell runs up and swings his sword at imhotep wap
slices imhoteps right arm off
it drops to the ground still clutching the book of the living
imhotep drops jonathan and spins around facing oconnell
okay pal lets see how tough you are without your right arm
imhotep grabs oconnell with his left arm and throws him half way across the cemetery
oconnell slams into a gravestone bounces off and crashes to the ground
he shakes it off
so hes left handed
imhotep is already striding towards him
jonathan lifts up his hand he has the key box back
he smiles at evelyn
i got it
evelyn runs for jonathan
oconnell swings his sword and cleaves a big chunk of molten flesh rot out of imhoteps stomach
on the outside imhotep looks human but on the inside he is still a rotten old mummy
imhotep backhands oconnell
knocks him twenty feet back
oconnell staggers to his feet
imhotep is right there
clubs him hard with his left arm
oconnell spins through the air slams into the side of a mausoleum
imhotep approaches rage in his eyes
oconnell gets up quickly pivots and hacks into imhoteps head
imhotep grins and punches oconnell in the face
oconnell is thrown back pulling his sword with him
he bounces hard off the mausoleum
lands on his feet
totally beat to shit
he can barely stand
jonathan lifts up the heavy gold book imhoteps severed hand still clings to it
jonathan cringes in disgust
evelyn yanks it off throws it away then start furiously working the key into the series of locks unlocking each of them
imhotep strides forward
oconnell backs into the mausoleum swings the sword imhotep tries to catch it it cleaves through his palm and deeply imbeds itself into his forearm
no matter imhotep rips the sword away from oconnell and casually flings it away
the golden book of the living opens with a hiss
jonathan holds it tight as evelyn quickly turns the heavy gold pages looking for something
oconnell turns to run but imhotep grabs him by the throat and lifts him off his feet
oconnell hangs there a dazed mess
imhotep grins says something in ancient egyptian then starts to strangle oconnell
about to die
evelyn turns and faces imhotep and reads an inscription kadeesh mal
imhotep pivots and looks at evelyn a look of sheer terror on his face
then he looks over at the detritus bog
which starts to bubble and shift
the swirling hole begins to open
and then suddenly the spirits of the egyptian gods waft out of the black bog and swirl around the priest mummies
the mummies all collapse and turn to dust
and then the spirits attack imhotep
lifting him and oconnell up into the air
imhotep lets go of oconnell who falls to the ground
evelyn and jonathan fearfully stumble away from the spirits jonathan trips and falls and accidentally throws the book of the living into the detritus bog
evelyn watches as the golden book sinks into the black putrescence
jonathan looks like hes about to cry
ten feet off the ground the spirits swirl around imhoteps body twisting it and turning it and slowly shriveling it
accompanied by the same strange flashing light we saw at the beginning of the movie when anck su namun was cursed
one last huge flash accompanied by a blast of wind and imhotep is spit out and thrown to the floor
he staggers to his feet he looks perfectly normal
his body is completely intact
oconnell swings his sword
imhotep jerks back
the sword scrapes imhoteps chest a swath of blood appears across imhoteps chest where the sword hit him
imhotep touches the blood on his chest amazed and horrified
oconnell runs imhotep through with the sword and shoves him backwards
imhotep stumbles back and falls into the detritus bog
the sword still in his stomach
evelyn and jonathan run up next to oconnell
they watch as imhotep gently sinks into the fetid swamp slowly dying
and then just before his head goes under imhotep looks up at them grins broadly and says something in ancient egyptian
evelyn translates death is only the beginning
imhoteps grinning face vanishes under the black bile
beni staggers across a chamber straining under the weight of another saddlebag filled with treasure
he spots a large ornate staff sticking out of a wall
he throws the saddlebag over the staff and collapses against the wall
and then the weight of the treasure pulls the staff down
which starts a massive aural chain reaction
beni backs away from the wall wide eyed filled with fear
all the walls start to sink into the ground
driven by tons of pouring sand
beni turns and hauls ass out of the chamber
oconnell evelyn and jonathan look around as all the walls start to descend
oconnell grabs evelyns hand
he pulls her forward and all three of them race past sinking pillars
they duck as they run into a descending doorway
beni scampers down a passageway the ceiling getting lower and lower until he has to crouch
and then he has to stick the torch between his teeth and crawl on his hands and knees
oconnell evelyn and jonathan crouch run into the treasure chamber
evelyn skids to a stop
looks in wonder at all the treasure
sand rains down on them
oconnell grabs her again and quickly pulls her through the mounds of treasure towards a sinking doorway on the far side of the room
the sound of the sinking walls is deafening
beni crouch runs into the treasure chamber
oconnell evelyn and jonathan race past him
he joins them as they run up a staircase
heading for a descending doorway which is already half gone its now only four feet high now three feet high now two feet
jonathan dives through the narrow gap
then oconnell dives through he spins around
evelyn dives but gets stuck in the middle about to get cut in half
oconnell grabs her arm and yanks her through in the nick of time
beni reaches through the narrowing gap with his hand oconnell grabs it but its too late
beni yanks his hand back just as the top of the door crashes to the floor
sealing him in
beni quickly crawls back down the stairs as the ceiling slams down behind him
he stands up and looks around with his diminishing torch
all the doorways finish closing
theres no way out
and then he hears something and turns around
over in the corner a scarab beetle stares at him chittering
beni waves his flickering torch at the scarab and backs away
he stands in the middle of the treasure chamber as dozens upon dozens of scarabs boil up out of the floor around him
beni is absolutely terrified
the scarabs start to move in
and thats when benis torch goes out
and then we hear beni start screaming in horror and pain
and the scarabs chittering hungrily
the temple collapses as oconnell evelyn jonathan and a pack of stray camels race through the ruins
a sinking crevice drops out right behind them
chasing them out through the front gates
the whole place rumbles ominously
they make it down the ramp as more ruins crash down behind them
a massive cloud of sand and dust billows out over the wall and into the air
our heroes and all the stray camels race out into the desert
oconnell evelyn and jonathan stand in the middle of the plateau surrounded by stray camels
they stare off at the sandy dusty volcano as it continues to rumble ominously
i guess we go home empty handed
oconnell looks at evelyn
wouldnt say that
evelyn returns the look a beat and then she wraps her arms around his neck and kisses him
oconnell returns it
jonathan just rolls his eyes snorts in disgust and climbs up onto a camel
when the kiss is over oconnell and evelyn share a smile then oconnell leaps up into the saddle reaches down grabs evelyns hand and pulls her up behind him
evelyn wraps her arms around his waist
oconnell and jonathan slap the reins
the camels start to move out
we pan down to the saddlebag behind evelyn hidden under the closed back flap we can see that its filled with benis stolen treasure
oconnell evelyn and jonathan ride off into the sunset
