a white bird soaring
the sky is a glorious explosion of blue and mauve and lavender
the setting sun washes the clouds with a delicate pink tint
the bird swoops and spirals and we are right there with him
then suddenly below us an extraordinary sight appears
it is the labyrinth an enormous maze of incredible mandala like intricacy
from our magnificent vantage point we are barely able to make out its details the twisting walls interrupted here and there by lush forest the complex web of waterways the
forbidding castle at the core
it is vast and magical frightening and compelling at the same time
we would love to linger perhaps fly lower and get a better look at this wondrous place but the bird flies on it is an idyllic setting warm and inviting
the late afternoon sun washes everything with a pink glow
between the water and a line of lush fruit trees is a flower strewn glade
a figure emerges from the trees and walks toward the water
it is a young woman dressed in a flowing white dress that swirls around her in the breeze
the pink light burnishes her hair and causes a gold circlet she wears on her head to glow
she is breathtaking a vision of innocence and grace
she stops to pick a flower and then turns suddenly as if she has heard something
girl is it you
she takes a few hurried steps and then stops smiling shyly girl your highness
the girl curtsies deeply and then looks up through lowered lashes the shy smile still dancing on her lips
and then we pull back to reveal a crown perched on a head of tight curls
we are looking through the crown at the girl as she rises slowly then looks boldly at the prince
girl do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight of you my lord
for though my father the duke has promised you my hand i cannot consent to be yours until the evil that stalks our land from highest hill to deepest dale
suddenly the girl stops speaking a look of stunned confusion on her face
from highest hill to deepest dale
her brow furrows in concentration and then damn
she burrows one hand into the deep sleeve of her gown and pulls out a rolled up soft cover book
she rifles through the pages
the prince is not a prince at all but a sheepdog wearing a tin foil crown
he thinks his work is over and its time to play and he lunges happily towards the girl who isnt a princess or even a duchess but year old sarah
sarah is knocked over by the playful dog
beneath the gown which we can now see is homemade and not very grand at all we see faded jeans and running shoes
sarah get off me you monster
the dog grabs the book out of her hand and runs away with it hoping to be chased
sarah doesnt follow she just sits up and pulls the grass out of her tangled hair and sighs with frustration
the dog comes back over to sarah its tail wagging hopefully
sarah if you value your mangy life merlin youll hand it over
the dog obediently drops the book
on the cover it says meanders queen a play in three acts by robin zakar
sarah reaches for it and we hear a clock tower begin to chime
sarah leaps to her feet
sarah oh no merlin
were really late
why does everything have to happen to me
merlin prances around her happily his foil crown in his mouth
sarah pulls it out of his mouth and throws it in a nearby trash basket
he rushes after it and peers into the basket wanting to fetch
sarah its all your fault you miserable mutt
she hikes up her dress and runs into the trees
merlin whimpers and tags along behind her
sarah comes bursting through the trees and runs down a hill toward the street
we pull back and we can see an enormous steel mill on the other side of the river
and now we notice that the light isnt pink any more but sort of dull and hazy and the idyllic glade is barely a suburban park and this is just
an ordinary day in a very ordinary place
sarah runs up a path to an older rambling house
she goes through the front door merlin hot on her heels and neither one of them sees the beautiful snow white bird that lands in a tree beside the path
sarah bursts through the front door and makes a beeline for the stairs
she almost makes it
sarahs mother appears in the hallway
mother sarah where have you been
sarah abruptly stops and changes to an elegantly graceful ascension of the stairs
sarah in an affected voice i cant talk to you now
im in rehearsal
she continues grandly on and heads for her room
mother you were supposed to be home an hour ago to baby sit for freddie
dont we at least deserve an explanation
sarah stops and leans over the railing
she speaks with a melodramatic solemnity
sarah as meanders queen ive been
dither me not about explanations
with that she turns and heads for her room
on the door is a sign that says admittance by invitation only
sarahs father comes into the hall
father whats that all about
mother its a part in a play raising her voice but thats no reason to
sarah turns in her doorway
she calls down
sarah chasten not your queen peasant
she dramatically sweeps into her room
sarah slams the door and leans against it playing the scene
father vo sarah thats no way to talk to your mother
sarah mumbles to herself shes not my mother
sarah takes a deep breath and closes her eyes
she can hear footsteps and someone comes to the other side of the door
sarah ignores her stepmother and kicks off her running shoes
with a practiced gesture sarah removes her jeans while leaving her gown in place
stepmother vo sarah when i tell you to be home at five i expect you to be home at five
sarah quickly shifts to her stepmothers attitude hands on hips and silently mimes her words
sarah yes madame
stepmother and dont yes madame me
father is she all right
stepmother frustrated of course shes all right
i left the bernsteins number on the kitchen table
freddie might be coming down with a cold so call us if he seems even the least bit uncomfortable
sarah vo sighs yes mother
i give up
she hurries down the stairs
father well see you later baby
sarah speaks along with him mimicking
sarah father vo dont open the door to strangers
we hear him leave
sarah waits a beat and then turns and opens her bedroom door
sarah and dont call me baby
she slams the door shut mimicking her parents precious little freddie might be coming down with a cold she sighs and looks around
this is really her world her retreat and she knows and controls every inch of it
the shelves are filled with an orderly array of childhood dolls and toys
the books are lined up neatly in the bookcase and if we could see them up close we would see that they were placed in alphabetical order and according to
the year they were acquired
she walks over to her dresser
she checks herself out in the mirror above the chest of drawers and adjusts the golden circlet which has been knocked askew by her run
she then stops for a moment and looks at the photographs on the dresser
one of her father her mother and herself as a little girl
another picture of her mother in a newspaper clipping is taped to the mirror
the headline says linda williams a smash in new play
a cover of a playbill is also tacked on to the mirror
it says best of both worlds starring linda williams
sarah then reverently opens a music box the kind with a twirling dancer inside and to the strains of an unbearably tinny version of greensleeves she begins to rehearse
sarah do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight of you my lord suddenly something stops her cold
sarah yelling angrily someone has been in my room
through the mirror we see what she sees an empty space on one of the shelves
she swirls around and rushes out the door
sarah bursts out of her room
sarah wheres lancelot
she stomps down the hallway
sarah wheres my bear
sarah enters freddies room
she searches the nursery
sarah nobody listens to a thing i say
she opens a toy box and rifles through it
sarah how many times have i told them to stay out of my room
she gets to the crib and looks down
freddie is wide awake gurgling at lancelot sarahs tattered old teddy bear
sarah and you you can just give me back my bear
she yanks it out of the crib and leaves
freddie looks hurt and his face starts to cloud up
sarah is curled up on her bed cuddling her bear
merlin sits beside her
she looks at the dog
sarah youre the only one who understands me merlin
he licks her face
she gets up and holds the bear out in front of her
sarah do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight of you my lord she is interrupted by freddies cries
sarah go to sleep freddie
the cries get louder
sarah sighs and repeats her favorite litany
sarah why does everything have to happen to me
sarah enters and approaches the howling infant
sarah i dont need this
she pulls the blanket up over him and attempts to tuck him in
sarah there isnt that nice
but freddie doesnt think so
he pushes the blanket off and howls even louder
sarah sees one of his toys on the floor and picks it up and gives it to him
she speaks through gritted teeth
sarah want your nice toy
but freddie doesnt
he flings the toy across the room
sarah bends over the crib and speaks softly
sarah you know freddie i heard that the only thing to do with a baby who wont stop crying is to get some goblins to come over and teach him
freddie lowers his screams to a whimper but a loud whimper
sarah how would you like that kid
a nasty evil goblin
freddie is quiet for a moment almost as if he is considering
then he really howls
sarah sighs and picks him up
she begins to pace back and forth and starts to hum
freddie goes back to a mere whimper
sarah oh you like that do you
she begins to hum even louder and more melodically as she places the baby back into the crib
she then begins one of the moat macabre lullabies you could ever imagine
she sings of how scary the dark is how the shadows on the wall like to eat you when youre small and how a baby doesnt stand a chance when
the goblins start their dance
she throws herself into her performance adding to it a wild dance that has her whirling around the room leaping into the air making strange shadows on the wall
finally the dance ends when too many crazed pirouettes result in her stumbling against freddies dresser
she staggers a bit and then the lights blink as a crack of thunder is heard followed by a flash of lightning
little freddie is wailing
he hasnt understood a thing that sarah has sung but he can sense that something is wrong
sarah ah cmon freddie
it was just a song
they are interrupted by the sound of the doorbell
sarah reacts with a gasp of surprise
freddie for some inexplicable reason is suddenly quiet
sarah approaches the front door with some trepidation
she starts to open it then realizes what she is doing
she fastens the chain and only then opens the door
through the door opening sarah can see a very elegantly dressed quite good looking man of an indeterminate age
he has a worldly air or is it other worldly
before he can speak a flash of lightning illuminates his face
he is a mesmerizing sight and sarah cant help but gawk
man excuse me is this the home of sarah williams
sarah williams the actress
sarahs jaw drops
sarah thats me
man allow me to introduce myself
he holds out his hand im robin zaker
sarah squeals with delight
sarah you wrote the play
sarah just a second
sarahs hand hesitates over the chain for just a moment and then she unfastens it and opens the door
zakar enters and extends his hand
zakar it is an honour miss williams
i understand you make a delightful queen meander
sarah well weve just started rehearsal but how did you know
zakar i was passing through this part of the country and heard that it was going to be done here
this is the first amateur production of the play which of course is delightful for me
sarah you know we were supposed to open tonight but we got delayed
the firemen had to use the hall
zakar yes i know thats why i wanted to stop by to see you
they are interrupted by a particularly loud crash from upstairs
and then freddie begins to howl
sarah thats my brother
there is another crash and sarah starts up the stairs
sarah ill be right back
zakar watches her run up the stairs
he glances around and then walks right to the liquor cabinet and takes out a bottle
freddie in standing in his crib crying his eyes out
sarah rushes in and sees that the storm has blown open the basement window and it is crashing against the wall
she rushes to close it
freddies screams are piteous
sarah oh freddie
there is more thunder and then lightning flashes across the darkened room
zakar vo perhaps i can soothe him
sarah gasps and whirls around
zakar is framed in the doorway
he has a drink in his hand
sarah holds the baby close
sarah you shouldnt be up here
zakar smoothly i just wanted to help
sarah rushes by him still clutching the baby
sarah comes out of the nursery and hurries down the stairs
freddie is still crying
sarah maybe youd better leave
she gets to the bottom of the stairs
zakar is making her very nervous
i uh dont think i care to talk to you about the play
he is right behind her almost too close
zakar neither do i
sarah is shocked and disturbed by this
zakar reaches over and smoothes freddies hair
zakar im more concerned about the baby of course
sarah pulls freddie out of his reach
sarah freddies just fine
but he isnt
hes still crying
zakar reaches into his pocket and pulls out a coin
be runs it over his fingers right in front of freddies face
the baby stops crying
zakar there isnt that better
sarah nervously uh sure
but you really have to leave
zakar ignores her and heads into the living room
zakar im not just a playwright as you can see
bring him in here and ill do some other tricks for him
youve got to
but he is already in the living room
she follows still holding the zakar is sitting on the sofa looking very comfortable
sarah stands in the doorway not sure what to do
reluctantly she goes and sits down across from him
zakar now watch this freddie
he reaches into his breast pocket and tugs on the handkerchief there
it comes out followed by many others all different colours
sarah rolls her eyes
this is not that exciting a trick
freddie isnt impressed either
in fact he starts to cry again
zakar so youre going to be like that are you freddie
well you know what that means
he leans across the table and sarah pulls the baby closer
zakar its time to call the goblins
sarah is surprised to hear this to say the least
it echoes her silly threat to freddie earlier
thats what we do with bad babies
we send for the goblins
and with that he reaches into yet another pocket and pulls out a poorly made very silly looking goblin hand puppet
sarah laughs with relief
zakar his hand in the puppet talks in a high pitched unconvincing goblin voice
zakar you like goblins dontcha freddie
singsong but i bet your sister doesnt
sarah rolls her eyes at this and then gasps
because for one very strange moment the puppet keeps bouncing but both of zakars hands are visible
and then the puppet seems to move away from the table and disappear
freddie claps his hands with delight
sarah jumps out of her chair
sarah where is it
zakar points to a large cabinet against the wall
zakar its in there
zakar see for yourself
sarah hesitates for a moment and then places freddie carefully on the rug
she then marches over to the cabinet and throws open the door
the puppet grinning wildly from inside the cabinet
sarah gasps and involuntarily slams the door
she whirls around to face zakar
sarah how did you do that
zakar leans back into the sofa
sarah oh sure
she nods skeptically
she cant see but we can definitely see the cabinet door slowly open behind her and out of it comes a tiny fierce looking goblin
this is not a puppet but a living creature that moves quickly out of sight with an exaggerated tiptoe
sarah is busy with another problem
she doesnt see freddie
sarah wheres freddie
in a panic sarah begins to look around this room
she calls for freddie and as she passes in front of the living room doorway we can see something scurry across the hallway
sarah stops and listens
but it wasnt a baby she heard
behind her there is more scurrying as creatures begin to appear from various parts of the room
we hear faint snickering
she turns to zakar terrified
sarah where is he
zakar points to the chair sarah was sitting in
she is behind the chair and cant see anything
but when she comes around in front of it she sees freddie comfortably ensconced in the cushions
and hes playing with the goblin puppet
sarah reaches over and grabs the puppet out of his hands
she flings it across the room and scoops up the baby
sarah who are you
zakar throws back his head and laughs then suddenly leaps off the sofa and lands very close to her
zakar ive been known by many names
but the one i prefer is jareth king of the goblins
sarah holds freddie close and backs away
sarah i dont believe this
amidst thunder and lightning jareth flings his arms up into the air and he is suddenly dressed in strange medieval garb a cloak swirling around him
and whats worse much much worse is that suddenly goblins are everywhere
popping out of drawers from under chairs swinging off the chandeliers
sarah turns and runs out of the room
its worse in here
the goblins are pouring down the stairs some slide down the bannister
sarah tries running into another room but is soon back followed by a dozen more
she barely makes it to the front door and struggles to open it with the baby in her arms
the goblins pull her back and laugh wildly
they fling her right into jareths arms
he scoops freddie up and whirls away from her
sarah tries to grab the baby back but the goblins get between them
sarah hysterical give him back you monster
give him back
jareth only laughs and starts to swirl gracefully
freddie laughs with delight and sarah struggles to reach him
with a superhuman effort she pushes through the mass of creatures and grabs onto jareths fluttering cloak
its like being caught up in a whirlwind of incredible force
sarah screaming i
but its too late
sarahs feet leave the ground and she is pulled with them and the whole mass of goblins
jareth and freddie swirl up through where the ceiling would have been up into the blackness
theres a quick montage of shots jareths laughing face sarah desperate as her fingers are losing their grip freddie whos having a great time goblins all gleeful then jareths garment
pulls out of sarahs grip
she falls out of frame a silent scream on her face
the sky is pink and the white bird swoops by us as we tilt down to see the exterior wall of the labyrinth
it is a high masonry wall that extends off in either direction
along the wall are various ornamental bushes and there is a small figure of a dwarf his back to us peeing into a tiny pond
it looks for all the world like one of those ornamental garden sculptures
but it isnt
this is hoggle
in a closer shot which is quite discreet hoggle finishes peeing and goes over to a particularly lush shrub
a few butterfly like creatures flower fairies flit around the bushes
hoggle an hows me pride an joy
he leans forward to sniff one of the magnificent blossoms sighing with pleasure as he does
but before he can indulge he is stopped by the whistling sound of a falling object
sarah falls from the sky and lands right on his prize shrub
incensed he screams with fury
hoggle what is this
look what you done
sarah struggles out of the broken shrub
sarah what are you saying you horrible little man
hoggle i aint horrible im hoggle
and just look
youve destroyed me prize blossoms
he realizes the extent of the damage to his prize specimen
hoggle ill get ya for it you big oaf
and he picks up a spray can and goes after sarah
but shes had enough
after the nightmarish kidnapping of freddie and a drop from the deepest space this guy is childs play
she reaches out and pulls the can from hoggles hands
she then grabs him by the shirt front and practically lifts him off the ground
sarah oh no you dont
if anyones getting anything around here its me
now where my brother
hoggle i aint sayin nothin til ye let me go
sarah sighs and lets go
sarah im sorry
but this just hasnt been my day
hoggle looks at his crushed shrub again
hoggle ye aint the only one
sarah ignores him and stares at the massive wall behind them
sarah and i dont understand any of this
hoggle shakes his head and sighs
hoggle now where have i heard that before
sarah what do you mean
hoggle i mean everyone who comes here thinkin they can make it through the labyrinth says sumthin like mimicking sarah in a whiny high pitch
i dont understand this whatever am i doing here how will i ever get home
sarah what makes you think im here to get through a labyrinth
hoggle shakes his head again
hoggle cant think of any reason why youd be standin here in front o this gate if you werent
sarah doesnt understand what he is talking about but when she looks up she cant believe her eyes
a huge gate where just a moment ago there nothing but smooth endless wall
sarah gulps in disbelief
then the huge wooden doors fly open and a terrified creature runs out full speed screaming for his life
right behind him come two menacing goblins riding on strange beasts
they are armed and dangerous looking
they quickly catch up with the creature and drag him screaming piteously back through the gate
before the gates close sarah can see more goblins what seems like hundreds of them
some are mounted most of them are armed
and beyond them a walled passageway seems to go on forever
then the wooden doors slam shut
sarah oh no
not more goblins
hoggle thats jareths goblin army and that other poor fool musta been caught meanderin where he had no business
sarah what will they do to him
hoggle i dont like to think about things like that
sarah i wonder if things can get any worse
hoggle sighs knowingly
hoggle hes taken sumthin o yours aint he
sarah is clearly surprised
hoggle jareth our high an mighty king
sarah nods excited that someone has a grasp of the situation
hoggle bet hes gone and taken sumthin you love
sarah shrugging close
hes got my baby brother
hoggle laughs derisively
hoggle baby snatchin
sarah so ive just got to do something
hoggle like what
sarah get freddie back of course
hoggle then yad have ta make it through the labyrinth cause jareths castle is at its very center
sarah looks at the gates and gulps
sarah is it difficult
hoggle snorts with derision
hoggle is me prize shrub crushed into oblivion
sarah is reaching the breaking point
sarah look im sorry about your bush
but its not like i asked to have some weirdo come and take my baby brother and then drop me out of the sky
hoggle well i didnt ask for some overgrown flower fairy to drop on me prized possession neither
sarah oh this is ridiculous
and she stalks off to the gate mumbling all the way
sarah to herself
standing here wasting time talking to some weird guy who should be living under a bridge
she is almost at the gate when she freezes with fear
through the gate she can hear the cheers and jeers of the goblins and what might be the wailing of their poor captive
theres no way she wants to risk facing that horrific crew
hoggle has come up behind her and as she backs away from the gate she bumps into him
she shrieks and whirls around
hoggle that aint the only way in ya know
sarah is very relieved to hear this
sarah its not
hoggle course it aint
theres many a route in
just only one way out
sarah well show me one
ive got to find my brother
hoggle sighs impatiently
be fingers a belt that he wears rattling it in an obvious manner
it in hung with every kind of watch and bracelet and ring you can imagine
hoggle information like that has a price
sarah taken aback by the amount of loot hes acquired
sarah i could give you this
she takes the gold circlet off her head
hoggle isnt interested
hoggle i had sumthin o this caliber in mind
he takes her hand and we see that she is wearing a beautiful ruby ring
sarah shakes her head vehemently
my mother gave me that
hoggle eyes it greedily
hoggle she could give ya another
sarah no she couldnt
sadness crosses her face suddenly she lives real far away
the sadness disappears just as suddenly
she holds out the circlet
sarah this is all you get
he grabs the circlet and bites it
something catches sarahs eye
it is one of the tiny flower fairies
she leans over for a better look
sarah no its not its plastic
hoggles eyes light up at that and he grunts with satisfaction as he strings the circlet onto his belt
sarah reaches out her hand to the sarah what a beautiful little thing
hoggle reaches for the spray can
hoggle let me at it
sarah is enraged
sarah you murderer
how can you kill such beautiful creatures
just then the fairy gives sarah a vicious bite
she shakes it off her hand and cries out in pain
sarah it bit me
hoggle quickly sprays the offending fairy and it falls to the earth screaming all the way
hoggle of course it bit ya
theres nuthin more vicious than a flower fairy
any fool knows that
sarah sucks on her wounded hand and tries not to cry
hoggle sighs but you dont know nuthin do ya
a tear trickles down sarahs cheek
hoggle i got a feelin im gonna regret this
he stalks off come with me an ill show ya a way in
sarah hurries after him
as they walk along the endless wall hoggle looks at the circlet and polishes it on his sleeve
hoggle thrilled plastic
another part of the wall
hoggle pushes a bush aside and shows sarah a tiny door
she looks at it dubiously
hoggle thisll take ya into the maze thats the first part of the labyrinth
sarah the first part
what comes after that
hoggle gets down on his knees and starts to crawl through the door
hoggle then theres the garden maze then the forbidden forest
sarah that sounds inviting
he is through the door
he is still talking but sarah cant hear him
she quickly tries to follow
i cant hear you
hoggle is through the door
then comes the castle
sarahs head appears
thats surely where jareths keepin the babe
he looks down at sarah she is through the door to her waist and straining to get the rest of herself through
hoggle sighs and grabs her hand
with a groan he tugs on her and pulls her through the doorway
she lands flat on her face
hoggle ya dont seem ta be able ta do nuthin without my help do ya
he chuckles and sarah gives him a look that could kill as she gets up and dusts herself off
she looks around and the environment seems rather benign
the brick walls are open to the sky here and there a flower peeks through a crack
sarah oh i think i can handle it
in fact this place doesnt seem so bad at all
and with that she jauntily heads down the nearest corridor
sarah turns a corner and comes face to face with a face
it is huge and grotesque and protrudes out of the wall
face go back
go back before its too late
sarah screams and backs away from it moving further down the corridor
she backs into something and whirls around
it is another face turn back while you still can
sarah turns and runs back the way she came
hoggle is still standing by the door an amused smile on his face
sarah comes rushing toward him
sarah oh im so glad youre still here
they were horrible
hoggle you dont mean the false alarms do ya
he shakes his head and goes off in the direction that sarah just came from
hoggle if ya gonna let a little thing like them scare ya missy ya havent a hope o makin it to the castle
sarah quickly follows
sarah false alarms
the corridor of faces
hoggle enters and the faces start in on their routine
sarah comes up behind him shuddering at the ghastly sight
face this is the path of no return
hoggle just ignore em
sarah are you sure
hoggle sighs and turns to the next face
face abandon all hope
hoggle oh shut up will ya
sarah is wide eyed at hoggles defiance
face but i was just getting to the best part
hoggle all right
but dont expect us to pay any attention
face winks at sarah youre going to love this
abandon all hope ye who enter here for this is the road to destruction
hoggle bored very nice
sarah is dumbstruck
hoggle takes her hand and yanks her along
face come back any time
i mean youre doomed doomed
hoggle and sarah continuing down a similar corridor
hoggle ya see things arent always what they appear to be around here missy
sarah shrugging whatever
all im interested in is getting my brother back from that creep
she starts to look around for something
hoggle i admire yer determination but it takes moren that to beat jareth
sarah picks up a rock
sarah well maybe im beginning to get the hang of this labyrinth business
she takes the rock and uses it to mark an x on the floor
sarah see now ill know which way we came in case i get lost
hoggle sighs missy goin back the way ya came is par fer the course around here what ya want to do is go forward
sarah look hoggle
ive got to find freddie and i dont need you to discourage me
hoggle and i dont need to be wastin me time goin around in circles with you
sarah thats fine with me
she starts off i know youre only after my ring anyway
she turns a corner and hoggle looks after her hurt and pity crossing his face
he takes a few steps in her direction and an officious little creature a brickkeeper emerges from the brickwork of the floor takes out the cobblestone that sarah marked and
replaces it with the marked side hidden
it looks up at hoggle
brickkeeper some people got no respect for property
hoggle sticks his tongue out at the creature just as it goes back into its hole
the white bird flies over the maze and we see sarah marching along
she thinks shes going forward but shes heading right for hoggle
sarah emerges into the corridor and comes face to face with hoggle
she whirls around to look behind her then back at hoggle again
but you were just behind me
im sure of it
hoggle shakes his head as she runs by him and looks down at the floor
sarah my mark
it was right here
hoggle comes up beside her
hoggle i told ya missy
things arent what they appear to be around here
jareth vo except when they are
jareth in all his glory
sarah and hoggle whirl around and both gasp with surprise and fear
jareth we meet again
sarah wheres freddie
what have you done with him
she starts to rush toward jareth but hoggle holds her back
he walks toward them and they automatically step backwards
he looks down at hoggle
jareth and what have we here
hoghead isnt it
hoggle is humiliated
hoggle me names hoggle
jareth ah yes
now i remember
he moves closer to hoggle youre the greedy little coward who lives outside the gate
shouldnt you be back there minding your own business
he chucks hoggle under the chin and is quite rough about it
hoggle fumes silently
sarah doesnt like this
sarah why why dont you pick on someone your own size
he looks her up and down
jareth whom did you have in mind
sarah tries to brazen it out
sarah i dont have time for any games
i want freddie and i want him now
jareth throws back his head and laughs
jareth ah freddie
an adorable little imp
im really growing rather fond of him
sarah where is he
jareth hes in my castle and seems to be enjoying himself immensely
he ambles toward them and they cant help themselves they both step backwards
jareth in fact he likes being with goblins so much im considering turning him into one
sarah thinks this is crazy
sarah you cant do that
jareth grinning oh yes i can
sarah looks down at hoggle and speaks under her breath
sarah can he
hoggle nods glumly
jareth but lets make it interesting
i wont do it for
if you make it to the castle before then you might be able to save him
if not well i think little freddie will mike an adorable goblin prince dont you
he laughs and holds up both hands and we see that they are empty
he then closes them and when he opens them again there is a gold watch in one hand
he throws it to sarah but hoggle intercepts it and eyes it greedily
annoyed sarah snatches it out of his hand
she looks at it and sees that it has hours marked on it
when she looks up again jareth is gone
worm vo well good riddance to bad rubbish
sarah and hoggle both jump and then look at where the voice is coming from
it is a little worm poking its head out of a hole in the brickwork
worm thats what the missus always says she does
why the last time she found that one around here she sent him packing
worm she dont take to his kind of nonsense thats for sure
now how about a nice cup of tea
the missus has a kettle on
sarah looks down at hoggle who shrugs
she then looks up at the worm and gives him a beaming smile
sarah and hoggle are sitting on the floor
sarah do you think jareth will give freddie back if i make it on time
hoggle its hard to say missy
but if i were you id worry bout first things first
sarah what do you mean
hoggle i means ya got ta find the castle before ya can go savin the babe and i mean ta see that ya do
sarah is thrilled and leans over and gives him a kiss on the cheek
sarah oh hoggle
thank you thank you so much
hoggle gets all flustered and tries to act gruff
hoggle seems to me i could be gettin that ring from ya after all if i plays me cards right
sarah regards him affectionately
sarah i know you dont mean that
youre helping me because youre really nice
hoggle i aint nice
i just likes the way ya stood up ta him is all
he is thoughtful for a moment almost to himself too bad moreve us havent had the guts to do the same
the worm reappears
worm how about a biscuit
the missus just took a fresh batch out of the oven
sarah thanks but we really dont have any time
weve got to get to the castle
hoggle ya wouldnt happen to know a shortcut would ya
worm well you might try taking that first left
sarah and hoggle look down the corridor
sarah but there isnt any left turn
just then a strange figure seems to come through the left wall and walks toward them
he is dressed in long flowing robes and wears a hat shaped like a bird
worm see theres a left turn right there where that wise one just came in
sarah a wise one
maybe he knows the best way to the castle
hoggle i wouldnt bet on it
but sarah is excited about the possibility of getting more help
sarah excuse me sir
could you tell us the best way to get to the castle
wise one the best way to the castle hmmm
im glad you asked that question
to sarahs and hoggles surprise the hat joins into the conversation
hat now youve done it gone and asked him a question
well be here all day
wise one a castle or fortress or as it is sometimes known a stronghold or citadel or that which has a turret and barbican but usually not a portcullis
hat what did i tell you
theres no stopping him now
often there is a rampart or bulwark and then a parapet perchance an actual vallum or counterscarp
hat shut up down there
and for entrenchment a moat drawbridge and sally port sarah looks at hoggle
sarah this was not one of my better ideas
hat well i told you that didnt i
but nobody ever listens to me
he looks down at the still mumbling wise one
the wise one blinks and looks at sarah and hoggle
wise one did one of you say something
sarah thinks quickly
sarah oh no
we never talk to strangers
wise one thats very wise
an idea worth savoring
hoggle nudges him
hoggle yeah but keep it under your hat
hoggle thinks this is hilarious
the hat doesnt
hat ve ry funny
the wise one continues on his way
wise one the stranger hmm
im glad you brought that up
the stranger one not indigenous also known as the alien or one from beyond the sea
hat hysterical i quit
i cant take it anymore
and then they are gone passing through the righthand wall as if it wasnt there
sarah watches after them stunned
sarah how did he do that
hoggle and how can we make sure he doesnt come back
sarah gives him a look and turns to the worm
worm just go over to that bit of wall there and walk right through it
the important thing is to forget what you think you know
it doesnt apply around here
sarah and hoggle walk down to the part of the wall where the wise one entered
once there they can see that a section of the wall is actually a passageway width behind the rest of the wall
sarah yells back to the worm
sarah thank you
and tell the missus were sorry we missed her biscuits
and then they walk through the wall and are gone
sarah and hoggle appear through the wall and sarah laughs with delight
hoggle wasnt as pleased with the experience and feels the wall as if testing to see if it really happened
sarah sees that they are in a corridor where the walls are crumbling and she climbs up to the top of one and looks over
sarah excited i can see the castle
it doesnt look far at all
hoggle is still feeling around the wall trying to figure out how they got there
sarah jumps down and starts to run down the corridor
sarah come on hoggle
hoggle sees her retreating figure and hurries after her
jareths great hall
he stands by a window and looks out over the labyrinth from this vantage point he can see clear across it the hovels that surround the castle walls the arid
plain that leads to the dense forest encircling that the complex maze
he seems lost in thought
the white bird enters the window and lands on his shoulder
behind him freddie is having a grand time
his slippery crawl is too much for the goblins that scurry about trying to mind him
meanwhile a particularly stupid looking goblin begins to approach jareth
he saunters across the room and is stopped short by a female goblin
she grabs hold of his shirt and hisses a warning
female goblin remember
its bow and scrape
bow and scrape
the stupid goblin nods and she lets him go
he then continues his approach to jareth only this time he does a little bow and then scrapes his foot across the floor then repeats the action
stupid goblin to himself bow n scrape
bow n scrape
jareth turns and sees the goblin
jareth well what is it
the goblin cant answer and do his bow and scrape at the same time so continues his painfully slow approach
bow n scrape
bow n scrape
annoyed jareth walks over to the goblin and lifts him up by his shirt front
the goblin is still bowing
jareth i said what is it
stupid goblin th
the girl and hoggle sire
theyre halfway th
jareth drops the goblin hard on the floor
freddie sees this and laughs with delight
jareth walks over and scoops the baby up in his arms
he then carries him over to the window
he calls over to an armed goblin by the door
jareth i think its time they had some company
armed goblin yes sir
be then salutes causing his visor to close on his face then stumbles around looking for the door
jareth shakes his head
jareth youll make a much better goblin than that wont you freddie
freddies response is to clap his sticky babys hand on to jareths face
jareth pretending he doesnt mind carefully removes it
he then looks down to the courtyard below
armed goblins are pouring out of the castle
sarah and hoggle are striding down a corridor
they are about to come to a corner
sarah are you sure jareth can turn freddie into a goblin
i mean thats really weird
they turn the corner and hoggle stops short
sarah becomes alarmed
sarah what is it
hoggle gestures for her to be quiet and then we can hear what he hears marching
they look back the way they came
sarahs and hoggles pov a battalion of armed goblins marching right towards them
they look at each other then turn and run
hoggle tries to get through the wall the way the worm showed them
hoggle quoting the worm just forget what you think you know and
he smacks headlong into the wall
he stops to rub his nose and sarah flies by him
sarah come on
freddie is now sitting on the lap of a goblin happily bopping it on the nose
jareth snaps his fingers and a group of sleepy musicians in the corner stumble over themselves to pick up their instruments
they begin to play and jareth looks out the window and begins a song
he sings about the labyrinth what it is his domain and what it is to others a test a proving ground not for the faint of heart
while jareth sings sarah and hoggle try to escape from the goblins
they get a lead on them for a while and come to another corridor with crumbling walls
they scamper up to get a look at their position and see dust rising from several parts of the maze
the goblins are everywhere
in another corridor they are stopped in their tracks by dozens of little fuzzy creatures who scurry towards them out of the way of the oncoming goblins
they turn and run back the way they came and as they do wall creatures chatter nervously and then disappear into the cracks between the bricks
in a corridor with very short walls they are able to see the tips of spears on either side of them going in the opposite direction
they enter a corridor with several arches curving over it forming small intermittent bridges
thinking they are safe they stop for a breath and soon realize that a battalion is right behind them
they scurry up the walls and as the song comes to an end they each lie across an arch hopefully out of sight of the goblins below
sarah and hoggle huddle above the corridor on their arches as two goblins bring up the rear
goblin i can kill better than you can
goblin but im better at maiming
everybody says so
and they are gone
shaken sarah and hoggle slide down from their hiding places
sarah do you think theyre gone
hoggle sure they are
goblins aint known fer their intelligence ya know
they has as much trouble findin their way through the maze as you do
he folds his arms and leans against the wall
sarah im not sure but i think you just called me stupid
suddenly hoggle yells and disappears
he has accidentally leaned on another secret wall opening
sarah quickly follows
hoggle and sarah are now in the long circular corridor that divides the maze from the beginning of the second ring of the labyrinth the garden maze
hoggle excited i think i know where we are
sarah thatll be a nice change
he ignores her and looks around excitedly
hoggle this place is the end o the maze
that means were near the entrance ta the second ring o the labyrinth
sarah the second ring
hoggle starts down the corridor
hoggle happily the garden maze
sarah gloomy sounds like a great place
whats it like
hoggle dont know i aint never made it this far before
he is skipping happily down the corridor when sarah hears something
it is a strange clanking sound
sarah frightened hoggle
whats that sound
hoggle stops skipping and sighs
hoggle now dont go gettin all girly on me missy now that wes finally safe
sarah so you think were safe do you
hoggle annoyed didnt i just say so
sarah then tell me what you think of that
sarah points behind them where the clanking noise is coming from
it is now much louder
hoggle comes over to her and takes a better look
their pov a slashing machine is coming right towards them
a slashing wall is made up of rows of furiously spinning knives and chopping cleavers and has brushes along the bottom to clean up whatever it encounters in its path
and there is no way around it because it completely fills the corridor
hoggle desperately tries to walk through the wall the way they came in but it is to no avail
he just keeps smashing his face
sarah starts to run for it
sarah come on
hoggle follows every so often trying and failing to get through the wall
sarah who is far ahead of hoggle comes to a door
and hanging on a hook next to it is a bunch of keys
she looks back at hoggle
sarah hoggle hurry
sarahs pov hoggle running toward her and making slow but steady progress toward them both the slashing machine
sarah fumbles with the keys furiously trying key after key in the door but to no avail
she is terrified
sarah none of the keys work
desperate she starts banging on the door
hoggle is just a few yards away from her
hoggle why dont you just try it
he then tries once more to walk through the wall
sarah tries the knob and sure enough it opens
she is delighted
what she doesnt see is hoggle suddenly disappearing through the floor
sarah its open
she turns around and he is gone
and the slashing machine is just a few yards away
she screams and in her terror falls backwards through the door
it slams shut just as the slashing machine reaches it we can see that four goblins in sanitation workers uniforms have been pushing the machine all along
they grunt and strain cranking the wheels that turn the knives and pushing all at the same time
sarah emerges into a large room
the walls are covered with large paintings in ornate gilt frames
she is a bit stunned by the clone call with the slashing machine as she approaches the first painting
sarah to herself what in the world
she stops short in front of the first painting and cannot believe her eyes
it is a painting of the watch with hours on it
the hour hand is on the
sarah fumbles into her pocket and finds the watch that jareth gave her
it also has the hour hand on the
sarah only hours left
the next picture is of a baby surrounded by gruesome goblins
on closer inspection the baby is obviously freddie
she chokes back a sob and runs over to the next one it is a picture of a rotunda with staircases going off in all different directions on different planes
it is an escher room and a closer look shows a goblin happily standing on the ceiling
she shakes her head and goes by the next painting and gasps involuntarily
it is a compelling portrait of jareth and she moves even closer
then she shakes herself out of it
the portraits pov sarah wills herself away and moves on and we hear the sound of jareths breathing
sarah is nervous and eagerly looks for a way out
she rushes by another painting giving it merely a glance
but something makes her go back for a better look
it is of a lovely manicured hedge maze
in the distance we can see the turrets of jareths castle
and in the sky nearby flies a beautiful white bird
and then sarah is amazed by what she sees
a closer look at the painting reveals that the white bird is flying
it moves over the hedges and we see a figure waving
sarah disturbed backs away from the painting
and then because it really is as wonderful as it is scary she goes back for another look and over her shoulder we can see hoggle waving and we hear
his tiny voice
this is the way to the castle
and sarah strains to hear and leans toward the painting stretching her hand out and touching the painting which makes it turn into a shimmering wall that her hand goes
and then she disappears right through the painting
and jareths portrait is now blank
sarah rushes up to hoggle and throws her arms around him
sarah what happened to you
i was afraid id never see you again
hoggle ya know that trick with the wall
damn if it dont work with the floor as well
sarah laughs and hugs him again
sarah and hoggle have been walking through the maze a long time
they are tired and bedraggled
sarah pulls the watch out of her pocket and sighs
sarah an hours gone by and i dont think were more than four feet from where we started
hoggle thats cause ya wont do what i tells ya
its clear as day we should be goin this way
he turns a corner and walks smack into a hedge dead end
he howls in pain and sarah sighs and follows him
hoggle disentangling himself from the hedge
sarah got any more suggestions
before hoggle can answer they are interrupted by a terrible gut wrenching scream
it is positively unearthly
sarah whirls around
sarah it sounds like it came from over there
hoggle points in the opposite direction
hoggle then lets go this way
sarah frowns at him as the scream begins again
it sounds like someones being hurt
hoggle exactly why we should be headin in the othermost direction
sarah shakes her head in disgust and runs off as the screams become more unbearable
sarah running through the hedge maze
driven by the sound of the screams she has an unconscious ability to find her way through
hoggle trying to keep up with her keeps running into dead ends
sarah emerging from the maze
she is stopped in her tracks by what she sees and quickly covers her mouth to prevent herself from screaming
hoggle emerges a moment later barely pauses before he heads right back into the maze
sarahs pov four goblins are torturing a huge creature ludo that they have hung by his ankle from a tree limb
they have also taken pains to bind the creature who it is obvious could take an most of them and win in a fairer fight
he is about nine feet tall powerfully built and his screams of frustrated agony are truly unbearable
the goblins have devised a unique method of harassing him
they all carry long sticks which have small fierce biting creatures on the end of them
the goblins bat their sticks at ludo who bellows and tries to swat back
since he is tied the nippers are free to bite him whenever they get near
sarah distraught peeking out from behind a hedge
sarah the poor thing
hoggle peeks out from behind sarah then quickly ducks back
sarah looks for a way to stop the torture
she picks up a rock and carefully aims it at the nearest goblin
it hits his head and knocks his helmet visor over his eyes
blinded the goblin lurches around swinging his nipper stick at the other three
blinded goblin hey
who turned out the lights
the other goblins see a new target and poke their nipper sticks towards him
he takes off and runs blindly into the hedge maze
the other three chase him carrying the nipper sticks upright no that we can see their progress in the bg
sarah desperately tries to untie the huge knot that holds ludo suspended upside down
she cant undo it and yells for hoggle sarah get out here you coward
hoggle appears from behind his hedge
he hesitates then pulls a dagger from his belt and joins sarah
he cuts through the rope in one hack and ludo falls to the ground with a thud
the nipper sticks start yammering away as they see sarah and hoggle freeing ludo over the top of the hedge
the goblin chase stops and they head back to the clearing
hoggle dives for the bushes but a determined sarah stays and pulls off the ropes
when ludo is free he picks up a huge log
as the four goblins come roaring back into the clearing ludo waves the log over his head
the goblin charge immediately shifts into a goblin retreat the nipper sticks yipping in fear
ludo puts down the log and sits his big shaggy head hanging down
he taken one hand and wipes away a tear
sarahs heart breaks
this thing is the ultimate stuffed animal
sarah is that your name
he nods and wipes away another tear
mean to ludo
sarah oh i know
they were terribly mean to you
she moves closer and pats his arm but its all right now
ludo sniffs and then breaks into the most endearing big dumb smile you have ever seen
sarah thats right ludo
im your friend
hoggle has come out from hiding during this exchange
he finds the whole scene a bit nauseating
and an unnecessary nuisance
if theres one thing he doesnt want its competition for sarah
hoggle i think im about ta be sick
they ignore him and ludo grins for all hes worth as sarah beams up at him
hoggle pulls her over to one side
hoggle i hope yer not thinkin o lettin the beast traipse along missy
hell just slow us up
sarah are you kidding
hell be a great help
the goblins are scared of him because hes so fierce
just then ludo shyly offers sarah a flower that he has just picked for her
she takes it and smiles at him
hoggle sarcastically i sees what ya mean
sarah shrugs and gives ludo a pat
hoggle sighs with frustration
hoggle i just thinks we was doin fine on our own
sarah and we can do even better with ludo
turns to ludo you want to help me save my baby brother dont you ludo
sarah nods with satisfaction and strides into the hedge maze
ludo right behind her
hoggle follows clearly unhappy
sarah hoggle and ludo come out of the hedge maze and see a wall with two sarah sized doors in it
hoggle this is it the entrance ta the forbidden forest
all we gotta do is pick a door
sarah what difference does it make
lets just go
ludo quickly steps between sarah and the doors
ludo one door
hoggle well thats great news
to ludo dont suppose ya know which is which
sarah skirts around ludo and goes up to the doors for a closer look at them
ludo one door
hoggle all right ya walkin mountain
ya made ya point
sarah ignores the bickering behind her and examines the doors
each one has a door knocker on it
both knockers are carved into faces except one has the ring going through its ears and the other has it stuck in its mouth
sarah to herself i guess once you choose a door
all you have to do is knock
the knocker with the ring through its ears speaks
knocker are you addressing me
sarah jumps back stunned
sarah you can talk
youll have to speak up
sarah turns to the other knocker
sarah you too
sarah shakes her head in amazement
the boys are still at it
hoggle if yer so smart why not show us another way inta the forest
hoggle that figures dont it
he turns his back on ludo fuming why the missy wants an overgrown hill o hair fer a friend is beyond me
ludo tries to make hoggle feel better and pats him on the shoulder
hoggle shakes his hand off with a growl
sarah is excited
sarah i love it
to knocker are you the right door to the forest
knocker it doesnt do to ask me
for some reason i cant hear a thing
sarah turns to knocker
knocker no use asking him either
all he does is mumble
knocker gets very excited
sarah i get it
you cant talk with that ring in your mouth
she removes the ring and looks at the face triumphantly
sarah now tell me which one of you is the right door to the forest
knocker oh i am
no question about it
how do we get you to open up
knocker one merely has to knock
sarah of course why didnt i think of that
she tries to get the ring back in its mouth
knocker oh no you dont young lady
ive had just about enough of that awful thing thank you very much
sarah but how are we supposed to get through this door if you wont let me knock on it
knocker well i really couldnt say now could i
sarah throws up her hands in disgust
knocker oh do speak up both of you
i cant hear a thing
hoggle and ludo are still at it
hoggle conspiratorially ya know
even if she does get the door open ya wont be able ta fit through
why not make it easy on us all and take a hike
hoggle is disgusted
hoggle yer quite the speechifier aint ya
sarah suddenly gives knocker an evil grin
sarah are you sure there isnt anything i can do to change your mind
knocker absolutely not
my lips are sealed
sarah thats what i thought
the knocker presses its lips firmly together
sarah deftly squeezes its nose shut
it sputters for air and finally has to open its mouth before it suffocates
sarah shoves the ring in with a gleeful cry of triumph
she knocks and the door swings open
sarah lets go
she goes through the door and hoggle and ludo race to follow
they both try to get through the door at the same time and get into such a tangle that the door closes before they can straighten themselves out
hoggle now youve done it
in a frenzy hoggle starts banging on both doors
sarah on the other side of the door
except on this side there is no door just a long expanse of wall
the forest is very dark and as its name suggests very forbidding
sarah can hear hoggle calling but it is very faint
sarah scared hoggle
hoggle is beating on the doors with such a frenzy that the other door swings open
hoggle im coming
he rushes through the door and disappears
we can tell from his voice that he is falling down a deep hole
we hear a huge splash
then that door shuts and ludo is all alone
he is sad and confused
a figure emerges from the hedge maze and begins to walk along the wall away from ludo
it is the wise one
ludo brightens and chases after them
the wise one stops and the hat looks ludo up and down
hat this ought to be a good one
wise one you have need of a door do you
a very useful thing the door also known as a portal or threshold and that which gives access a gate or gangway
he continues walking and ludo walks with him listening intently
also an entrance or entry often accompanied by a propylaeum
hat sighs if only i had hands i could cover my ears
that is if i had ears
not to be confused with a window or fenestration
sarah has waited long enough
sarah hoggle ludo
where are you
she reaches into her pocket and looks at the watch
the hour hand is on the
sarah whispers oh freddie
she shoves the watch back into her pocket well you guys are going to have to catch up with me cause i cant wait
then determined she strides off
hoggle is in a pool at the bottom of a deep hole in the ground
there is a ledge just above him and he splashes violently trying to reach it
hoggle somebody help me
i cant swim
sarah is in a very thick creepy part of the woods
she is clearly lost
she gets herself tangled in a thorn bush and struggles with it to get herself free
finally she does and then frustrated sits down on the ground
sarah why does everything have to happen to me
but theres no time to think about that because she hears the sound of a driving drum rhythm and then a wild looking spindly leering little creature comes scampering through
the trees and into the clearing and then another and another and another
sarah is terrified as they approach her but then not so terrified because the creatures arent doing anything except dancing wild loose limbed frenzied dancing
sarah laughs and cant help but be taken in by the wild spectacle
and then they begin to encircle her still moving to the wild rhythm
sarah laughing moving what are you
wild thing were wild things baby
wild thing wild and free
wild thing get down
and then more wild things appear and these produce instruments
as and turn the drum rhythm into a frenzied upbeat number
wild thing you call that wild
ill show you wild
and then he does an amazing thing to say the least
he takes his head off and rolls it along his arms from hand to hand like a juggler then tosses it high in the air and deftly catches it on
sarah gasps and tries to get sway but another wild thing pushes her back into the middle of the melee
wild thing cut me some slack and move on back
and they do and moving to the pounding rhythm he takes his eyes out of his head and waves them at sarah
he then tosses them on the ground as if they were a pair of dice
they land at sarahs feet looking straight up
wild thing snake eyes
sarah is fascinated and repelled
and the beat gets hotter and the frenzy more frenzied and she cant help getting a little wild herself
she begins to really dance
wild thing thats it baby get wild and free
but youll never be as wild as me
and to prove it he takes his head off and begins to dribble it like a basketball
wild thing leans over to sarah and whispers conspiratorily
wild thing i wouldnt call that really wild would you
sarah well its
wild thing id call this wild
and he takes off his head puts it on the ground as if it were a golf ball and then removes a leg and uses it as a golf club
the head goes flying right to sarah
sarah catches the head then tries to get it back to its body but the body dances into the middle of all the other wild things and she cant find
so theres sarah running around like a chicken with two heads when suddenly the ears start to flap and the head flies out of her hand
a wild thing grabs her hand and turns her around
wild thing that was wild baby
he starts to dance now how bout gettin wild with me
but sarah has had enough
sarah i think ill sit this one out
wild thing not with us you dont
wild thing cause were wild
and then theyre all over her like a bunch of hyper puppies and its really too much
ive got to find the castle
wild thing well why didnt you say so baby
wild thing thats a wild idea
and then his head flies off and he has to quickly grab it and put it back and meanwhile the others start pushing and pulling on sarah and propel her
into the woods
wild thing they got some wild goings on at the castle baby
hoggle is holding on to the ledge with his fingertips
he doesnt have the strength to hold on much longer and he looks down at the water in mortal terror
he begins to slip just as a door opens in the sheer rock and jareth enters accompanied by goblins
jareth well what have we here
if it isnt little piggle
hoggle screams and slips into the water
he tries to struggle back to the ledge but the goblins push at him with poles laughing maniacally
jareth did the girl decide she doesnt need you now that she has that beast
hoggle angry she wouldnt do nuthin like that
jareth leans over the water laughing
jareth dont you know she could never care for a repulsive thing like you
hoggle splashes and tries to stay afloat
hoggle she does care
me n sarah is friends
jareth only until something better comes along
and ive definitely got something better in mind
hoggle dont you hurt her
hoggle grabs on to the ledge and the gleeful goblins push him back down into the water
jareth what i do to her is my business
and it is inevitable
he grabs hoggle by the shirt front and lifts him out of the water
jareth you can be with me or against me
hoggle terrified wh
what do i gotta do
jareth i doubt if she can make it to the castle in time
he leans down and speaks directly into hoggles face
jareth but just in case i want you to deliver her to me
id rather die
jareth sneers scornfully
jareth then so you shall
he drops hoggle back into the water
the goblins shriek with delight
hoggle goes under and comes up sputtering
jareth was about to leave
he turns back to hoggle a look of amusement on his face
hoggle i gotta know what
what youll do to her
he splashes pathetically in a desperate attempt to stay above water
jareth i will do what ever amuses me
he reaches into his cloak and brings out a perfect peach
jareth all you have to do is give her this
he tosses hoggle the peach
hoggle catches it and immediately the water starts to recede
jareth youve made a very wise decision
he leaves followed by the goblins
hoggle i didnt decide nuthin
hoggle stares forlornly at the peach and soon the water is gone and he is sitting on cold damp ground
the wild things are leading sarah on a rocky path
she stumbles along but they couldnt care less
sarah are you sure this is the way to the castle
wild thing oh did you say the castle
wild thing i thought she said hassle
wild thing i thought she said rassle
wild thing rassle
thats a wild idea
he leaps on sarah and she flings him off
sarah ok guys funs over
she starts to leave and they pull her back
wild thing over
its just begun
and then the musicians are back and the dancing gets wilder than ever
the wild things totally surround sarah and though they arent hurting her they are definitely not letting her out
what they do is start throwing their heads at each other and switching them
wild things now this is really wild
a door opens in a nearby boulder and ludo appears
in the background we can see and hear the wise one as he wanders off
very often preceded by a porch or portico also verandah and followed by a vestibule otherwise known as an antechamber or foyer
hat why me
the door closes
ludo sees sarah in the middle of this weirdness and is just a bit confused
sarah sees him amidst the flying heads and cries out in relief
sarah are you kidding
get me out of here
ludo approaches the wild things and grabs a head before it reaches its target and calmly tosses it into the trees
wild thing hey big fella
thats a little too wild
but theres no time to talk because ludo calmly catches the other heads and tosses them away
the bodies go scurrying after their heads followed by the musicians
sarah is free
sarah oh ludo
im so glad youre here
she gives him a kiss and he beams
sarah wheres hoggle
sarah weve got to find him
do you think we can
ludo is very confident
he spent a lot of time with the wise one
he ambles off with sarah following
hoggle is more depressed than ever
the peach is nowhere to be seen
suddenly ludos head appears above
hoggle almost jumps out of his skin and then is totally outraged
hoggle aint that the clever observation ya feeble excuse fer a thinkin creature
sarah appears from behind ludo
sarah be nice hoggle
or we wont get you out
hoggles face lights up and all thoughts of anger are forgotten
sarah hoggle and ludo march through thick overgrown forest
they do not know that they are being spied on by jareths goblins
the threesome emerge into a clearing and see that they have come to a wide fissure that goes off in either direction as far as the eye can see
it is spanned by a rickety bridge held by two thick wooden posts on either side of the gap
sarah eyes the bridge warily
sarah it doesnt look too strong but we dont have much choice
suddenly they are interrupted by a high pitched but powerful voice
voice vo halt
halt or be slain forthwith
at first they dont see a thing and look around for the source of the voice
then the imposing inch high figure of didymus resplendent in rakish hat and swashbuckling sword emerges from behind one of the posts and stands in front of the bridge
ludo and sarah are dumbstruck
hoggle however is not at a loss for words
hoggle out of our way ya wretched little rodent
didymus looks directly at hoggle
didymus you sir shall be the first to feel the point of my sword
hoggle snorts with derision and sarah tries a more sensible approach
sarah please we really have to cross this bridge
its a matter of life and death
didymus shrugs elegantly
didymus under any other circumstances i would hasten to oblige you fair damsel for your mission sounds a worthy one
sarah oh it is
didymus but i am sworn
without my permission none may pass
sarah throws up her hands and hoggle mumbles under his breath
it appears to be up to ludo to break the deadlock
he lifts didymus up into the air and moves him to one side
they then start to walk toward the bridge and didymus chases them brandishing his sword
didymus you dishonor me varlets
to his chagrin they ignore him and keep walking
this gets their attention and they turn to look at him annoyed
hoggle what is this weasel babblin about
it is too much for didymus
he flings himself at hoggle with a mighty war cry
hoggle tries to run for it but didymus is right behind him administering more than a few pinpricks in embarrassing places
hoggle dives behind a bush and didymus sniffs at his cowardice
he comes back and faces ludo
didymus it is you i want rogue of rogues
you who dealt me the gravest affront
and with that he jabs ludo in the foot
ludo is stunned and howling begins to hop on his good foot
didymus his head thrown back for a triumphant yell goes after ludo with his sword flashing and there is nothing for ludo to do but pick up a branch and
it is the most mismatched duel in the history of chivalrous absurdity didymus moving at an incredible speed parrying the mighty swipes of ludos branch with great skill and no
small amount of difficulty
and ludo fending off the incessant pinpricks of the little sword leaping about with surprising agility and at a rate that exhausts him totally
finally the two of them breathing heavily lower their weapons
and to everyones surprise didymus throws down his sword
didymus i no longer wish to slay you for you are a truly noble knight
then didymus strides up to him and craning his neck attempts to look ludo in the eyes
didymus destroy me if you will
ludo quickly drops his branch in response
the whole thing has upset his gentle nature terribly
didymus then holds out a tiny paw
didymus never have i met my match in battle yet you noble knight have fought me to a standstill
ludo kneels and tentatively takes didymus paw into his own huge hand
didymus let us be brothers henceforth and fight for the right as one
sarah cheers and hoggle unimpressed rubs his sore rear
ludo smiles from ear to ear
then he and didymus exchange the ritual kiss on each cheek which in their case is not easily accomplished
sarah then turns practical
sarah well now that thats settled lets get going
she heads for the bridge but didymus blocks her way
didymus you forget my sacred vow my lady
i cannot let you pass
sarah is incensed
sarah but you said ludo was your brother
how can you refuse him
didymus i have taken an oath
i must defend it to the death
hoggle enraged turns on ludo
hoggle some brother he turned out ta be
hoggle well if hes so good why wont he let us get on with our business
ludo scratches his head
he has no idea
sarah sits down beside the crestfallen didymus
sarah ok lets handle this thing logically
what exactly have you sworn
didymus brandishes his sword
didymus i have sworn with my life blood no one shall pass this way without my permission
sarah then may we
have your permission
didymus is stunned
hoggle and ludo barely breathe
slowly didymus looks all around and then with a courage greater than any he has ever had to call on before he says it
and the sky doesnt fall and the earth doesnt heave and everything is exactly as it should be
sarah thank you
didymus breathes a sigh of relief and steps aside to let them pass
ludo is the first one to go over and that is unfortunate
because the rickety bridge collapses under his weight
sarah and hoggle jump back on the ground near didymus just in time and poor ludo swings over the deep fissure hanging on to one of the ropes that held
with a mighty effort he hoists himself up on to the opposite side and looks forlornly over at the others
sarah oh no
sarah crumples to the ground and stares miserably at the broken bridge
hoggle now see what ya done ya mush brained mammoth
didymus i sir didymus take responsibility for the actions of my brother my lady
lash out at me if you must
sarah im not mad at ludo sir didymus
im just upset because time is running out and i have to rescue my baby brother
didymus is struck to the very roots of his chivalry
didymus you mean to rescue a child
sarah the goblin king took him and ive only got
she takes out the watch
the hour hand is on the
five hours to get him back
didymus yells across to ludo
didymus is this your quest too my brother
didymus is overwhelmed
didymus then i shall join you lady
i am at your service upon my sword
he bows low before sarah and she smiles
sarah i happily accept your fealty sir didymus
hoggle frowns with displeasure at this latest development
hoggle this is all well an good missy
but we still got one little problem
they all look across the fissure at ludo
hoggle yes yes
whats that got ta do with us gettin over there without a bridge
hoggle were wastin our time missy
lets you an me go find another
he is interrupted by ludo bellowing which is followed by a sympathetic rumbling
suddenly rocks pile in from both directions until there is a pile in the fissure high enough for them to walk across
sarah laughing they sure are ludo
she skips happily across followed by a sullen hoggle
didymus whistles and is quickly joined by a tail wagging sheepdog
sarah gasps he is the spitting image of her own merlin
my noble steed
sarah laughs and shrugs
nothing surprises her in the labyrinth
the edge of the forest
from here you can see the castle in the distance just across the dry cracked plain
the sky is full of stars
sarah hoggle ludo and didymus are sitting around a fire
didymus what will you do after we save the child my lady
sarah take him home of course
that is if i can figure out how
didymus what is your kingdom like
do you have many knights to defend your honor
sarah not even one
didymus it cannot be
what bitter place is this that does such dishonor to my lady
sarah its a place where
where nobody really sees me
sarah laughs i know you do ludo
she turns to didymus and thanks to you sir didymus i finally have a knight
he bows graciously
hoggle who has been watching this scene feels rejected and miserable
he gets up and wanders away from the fire
after a moment sarah follows him
sarah dont you feel like resting
hoggle i aint tired
sarah me neither
what i am is hungry
hoggle winces but sarah doesnt notice
sarah looks back at ludo and didymus
ludo lies on his back snoring loudly
didymus dozes against ambrosius side
sarah theyre both wonderful arent they
hoggle theyre alright
sarah theyre more than that
theyre loyal and strong
and with their help im going to beat jareth
hoggle shakes his head sadly
sarah speaks as an afterthought
sarah and yours too of course
hoggle i aint no fighter
she shrugs that off and wanders away to look out at the castle
hoggle goes through agony for a moment and then makes a decision
if youre hungry
he holds out the peach that jareth gave him the worlds most delicious looking peach
sarah oh great
she happily taken the peach and bites
it takes everything hoggle has to not put his hands over his ears
she takes another bite and then stumbles
sarah laughing everythings dancing
she looks up at the sky exhilarated
sarah even the stars are dancing
hoggle turns and walks back to the fire
sarah stumbles about as she gazes happily at the sky
freddie is leading the goblins on a merry chase
he crawls around the room pulling things off shelves
a goblin is on his hands and knees in front of jareth polishing his boots
jareth kicks the goblin and sends him flying across the room
this makes freddie laugh and he pulls a book off the shelf and throws it
it hits a goblin on the head
jareth scoops up freddie and puts him in his cradle
he sits down next to him
jareth little goblin to be i have something to amuse you
he waves his hands in front of freddie and suddenly beautiful crystalline balls appear in them
he runs them over his fingers like so many coins their molten light so dazzling that freddie kicks up his legs with excitement
and we can see that at the end of his pajamas are two wizened goblin feet
jareth laughs and flings the balls into the air and they turn into bubbles beautiful mesmerizing bubbles
jareth soon little one
very very soon
and they both watch the bubbles as they fly out the window and over the labyrinth coldly beautiful against the darkening sky
sarahs hand opens slowly and the half eaten peach falls to the ground
she stares out into the sky mesmerized
the bubbles are approaching dazzling dancing bubbles
and then she hears music haunting spell casting music
the bubbles come closer and we can see that each one contains a twirling dancer a dancer just like the one in sarahs music box
she gets up and follows them
hoggle watching from the woods
hoggle damn you jareth
he turns and begins to walk away and damn me too
a bubble with sarah inside it floating through the sky
she appears enchanted and she begins to twirl just like the other dancers
a giant bubble with a magnificent ballroom inside it
tiny bubbles rush to join it
in one of them is sarah
the music changes and now sarah is inside the ballroom
it is a magnificent spectacle with all the beauty and decadence of an th century venetian ball
magnificently dressed dancers swirl to the music in an incredibly opulent setting
but when you look closer you sense decay just beneath the surface things are threadbare faded
the guests wear masks that are elegant parodies of goblin faces giving them all a slightly sinister look
and there is something very provocative about all of them the women have bare shoulders and daring decolletage many of the men have their shirts open to the waist
some of them lounge against the wall indolently and there is the feeling that the party has been going on all night
in this setting sarah is the picture of innocence
two women snickering behind their fans as sarah approaches and she is suddenly terribly self conscious
how plain she feels amidst all this
she looks into one of the many mirrors that line the ballroom and sighs at her image
then suddenly she sees something in the mirror that makes her gasp
the mirror and in it the reflection of a resplendent jareth dancing with a particularly exotic looking woman
sarah whirls around trying to get another glimpse of jareth
she is so intent on trying to see him that she doesnt notice that she is being stared at brazenly by a young man leaning against the wall
he moves next to her and whispers something into her ear
she hurries away shocked and the young man throws back his head and laughs
and jareth sees the whole thing
sarah is approached by a middle aged man who has a box hanging at waist height from a ribbon around his neck
it looks like sarahs music box
she looks down at it with interest and he throws open the cover
but there is no dancer inside instead there is a stick carved like a snake
it shoots out at sarah and she cries out and backs away
all the people around her laugh and she moves hurriedly on
jareth who is dancing with an even more beautiful woman than before watches sarah
sarah is looking for jareth
she spots him and sees him whisper something to his partner who smiles knowingly from beneath her mask and licks her lips
sarah blushes and turns away and finds herself looking into another mirror
but in the reflection jareth isnt with a partner
he is standing alone the dancers a whirling blur around him and he is looking straight at her
sarah whirling around to face the crowd and she sees jareth with yet a third beauty
and then she realizes that it is herself
in a trance like state she moves through the crowd to get a better look
sarahs pov she is whirling in jareths arms and she is the most beautiful woman at the ball
jareth smiles down at her and the attraction between them is palpable
jareth you look like a queen
sarah looks up at him thrilled by his words
i feel like
dont know what i feel
jareth smiling dont you
and he whirls her around dizzyingly so dizzyingly that she swoons in his arms
he catches her before she can fall very far tightening his grip around her waist
sarah are we
are we in a bubble
jareth yes we are
a dream bubble
where your dreams can come true
our sarah is being jostled by the crowd
she stumbles and almost falls on top of a couple on a bench
the woman is sprawled across the lap of the man who wears a mask with a very phallic nose
sarah backs away from them frightened
jareth and sarah dancing
she is smiling up at him he has never looked more handsome
there is something more open about him as if he too is caught up in the moment
he nuzzles her hair with his lips and whispers in her ear
jareth whispering my queen
then he begins a song
a song that tells sarah he will give her everything she wants even things she doesnt know she wants
a song that says forget it all all the restrictions all the powerlessness
forget and stay in the dream
our sarah watches mesmerized
but every time she tries to get closer to jareth and sarah she in jostled by a lascivious admirer pushed out of the way by women laughingly being chased by
she stumbles against a wall and a door opens
inside pillow feathers are flying and she cant make out what the several people are doing
a woman comes up to the doorway winks at sarah and closes the door
jareth finishes the song and sarah looks up at him smiling
he moves his face closer to hers and she closes her eyes
his face comes closer and closer
our sarah shrinks back from what she is seeing
she turns and runs pushing herself though the languid crowd right into the bubble itself
sarah comes crashing through the bubble and the whole ballroom crumbles
in seconds it resembles nothing so much as a junkyard
sarah runs through the streets of a part market part junkyard
there are piles of rubble and junk everywhere and between them are tents from which people hawk objects of all kinds
some of them approach sarah and she pushes them away sobbing
sarahs pov a red tent and standing in front of it is an old woman stooped over from the objects piled high on her back
she beckons to sarah and pulls the tent flap aside
junk woman ere it is dearie
all the fings you want all the fings you need
the flap opens wider and inside the tent we can see sarahs room
sarah gasps at the sight and runs headlong into the tent
she trips over the threshold and lands face down on her bed
sarah sits up on the bed and looks around the room
she shakes her head and laughs
sarah what a dream
she gets up and stretches then walks over to the mirror
she smiles at her reflection
sarah yep youve got quite an imagination kid just what a great actress needs
she walks over to the bed and picks up lancelot the bear
sarah how about a midnight snack sir lance
she goes over to the door and opens it
the junk woman peers in
junk woman avent you got everythin you need dearie
sarah screams and slams the door
she buries her face in the bear
sarah it is just a dream
she takes a deep breath and goes to the door again
she opens it very slowly
sarahs pov the same teeming activity
the junk woman peers in again
junk woman best to stay in there where its safe dearie
dont know what might appen to you out ere
sarah clams the door again and rushes over to the window
a group of revellers peer in at her and laugh
she quickly pulls the curtains closed and walks back to the center of the room
she stands clutching the bear then looks up at her reflection in the mirror
herself as a very old woman clutching a teddy bear
old sarah best to stay in here where its safe
dont know what might happen to you out there
sarah steps back from the mirror and suddenly the floor becomes a sea of mud and all the objects in the room come falling down on her
as she tries to rise out of the muck more objects land on and around her and pull her down
somebody help me
ludo and didymus desperately searching for sarah didymus riding his hoggle sits at a bar drowning his sorrows
a junk man bartender works behind the bar
hoggle slams his cup down
the bartender holds out his hand greedily
hoggle pulls a treasure off his belt and slams it on the bar
the bartender pours
didymus and ludo approach the red tent
they spy the junk woman
didymus did you see a noble maiden pass this way
junk woman a noble maiden eh
what would she be doin in a place like this
didymus shes on a rescue mission
the junk woman finds this hilarious
junk woman a rescue mission ha
youre in the wrong place for sure
the only fings we cares about rescuin around ere is our worldly goods
she takes an oil lamp off her back and shines it on her sleeve for emphasis
sarah is drowning in a sea of junk
she hears didymus and cries out hopefully
sarah didymus in here
the door opens and the junk woman peers inside
junk woman dont worry dearie
i sent im away
junk woman knew you wouldnt want to be leavin your nice fings for no rescue mission
sarah oh my god
junk woman freddie
is that one of them dolls over there
or that nice teddy
sarah struggles for the door in the sea of junk
hes my brother
and ive got to save him
she continues pushing through the junk
junk woman no you dont dearie
you can stay right ere with all your pretty fings
sarah knows what her choice has to be
sarah i know i can
joyous but i dont want to
she lifts herself out of the junk with a mighty heave and stands in the doorway
she looks down at the junk woman triumphantly
sarah now get out of my way
sarah runs out of the tent a look of triumph on her face
the junk woman pulls something off her own pile and holds it out to junk woman wait dearie
look at this
she holds out sarahs music box opens it and the little dancer twirls inside
sarah grinning keep it
and she is off
as sarah goes the camera lingers on the junk woman
and we begin to move around to her other side and even though we had just seen her from all sides we now see something very very different
where the other side of the woman should be we see a cross section of her with jareth inside
his head is beneath the pile of junk and his hand is inside her head making it laugh
he is the puppeteer operating the junk lady as indeed she has been operated
jareth is mad
ludo and didymus sit forlornly at the gate
sarah appears out of the night
didymus my lady
ludo leaps to his feet
sarah rushes into his arms
didymus is hoggle not with you
sarah pulls away from ludo
sarah hoggle made his choice hes
not part of the mission anymore
didymus angry the coward
sarah shrugs and smiles at him
but theres no time to discuss it
weve got a baby to rescue remember
she leads them through the gates
streets full of hovels encircle the castle
this is where the goblins live
as sarah ludo and hoggle walk through the dark eerie streets they are met by the slamming of shutters and the extinguishing of lights
didymus methinks they are expecting us my lady
a child goblin peers at them from an open doorway
a female goblin sees him and drags him inside and slams the door
sarah grimly methinks youre right
hoggle is still at it
he pulls his belt off his body and we see that the only treasure left is sarahs plastic circlet
he slowly pulls it off and stares at it
the bartender approaches his eyes lighting up at the eight of this treasure
hoggle hesitates then hands the circlet over
the bartender bites it and his face lights up with glee
he goes to get the drink and hoggle puts his face down on the bar and sobs
at the other end of the bar sits the wise one
the hat looks over at hoggle and shakes his head knowingly
hat drinkin to forget eh buddy
hoggle looks up
wise one to forget ah yes
to suffer a mental lapse to obliterate from ones consciousness to suffer amnesia a blank or fugue to drink the waters of lethe
hoggle drunkenly whats lethe
wise one the waters of forgetfulness
they remove from our minds what is too painful to remember
hoggle looks thoughtfully at the drink in his hand
but with the memory goes our wisdom or knowledge that which brings us understanding also enlightenment
but there is no one to continue benefitting from the wise ones pearls
hoggle is gone
hat you can cool it down there
a grasp of things a depth or profundity of thought
the hat sighs and looks over at the bartender who is still admiring his plastic treasure
hat another one over here
and make it a double
sarah ludo and didymus emerge into the vast courtyard outside the castle
it in eerily quiet
sarah were going to make it
didymus sniffs the air
didymus i am less than sure
they are interrupted by a high pitched shriek as a goblin jumps on ludos back
then the courtyard is filled with goblins what seems like the whole army coming right at them
didymus fends off the vanguard party with his sword and ludo punches out the ones that get by him
didymus unswords a goblin and his weapon goes flying
sarah picks it up and does some parrying of her own
but there are too many of them
the threesome turn and run
jareth stands by the window watching the battle
the white bird sits on his shoulder
jareth looks over at freddie who stands holding on to the side of the cradle
jareth smiles and turns back to the melee below
the bird flies out the window
sarah ludo and didymus race down the streets
the goblins are in hot pursuit
they come careening around a corner and it seems that they have escaped their pursuers
the sound of the goblins seems to be getting farther away
sarah i think we lost them
they turn and see that unfortunately they have come full circle and are right back in the courtyard
ludo climbs part way up a wall and looks over the streets
didymus what do you see my brother
what he sees is the goblin army coming down every street right towards them
and then the trouble arrives and sarah and didymus are heavily into swordplay
ludo tries clumsily to get down and is tormented by goblins who prick at him with their spears
sarah looks up and sees his predicament
she gets an idea
sarah call the rocks ludo
call the rocks
ludo makes a heroic effort and gets to the top of the wall
he then throws his head back and bellows
an enormous rumbling is heard and soon the streets are filled with boulders all careening towards ludo
they knock goblins out of their path like so many bowling pins
sarah and didymus fight bravely
ludo keeps bellowing and throwing off the occasional goblin that is stupid enough to jump on him
soon the rocks reach the courtyard and form a barrier between the threesome and their attackers
ludo reaches down and lifts sarah and didymus on to the wall
they jump and disappear into the castle enclave
a door opens in a dark part of the castle
ludo sarah and didymus enter
they look around and quickly tip toe down a dark corridor
they turn a corner and see some goblins marching their way
they duck out of sight
the main entrance to the castle
two goblin guards stand outside the large wooden doors
the results of the threesomes escape can be heard in the distance
a figure staggers out of the dark singing drunkenly
it is hoggle
its so cold in the night with no gold to keep me warm he trips over his feet as he approaches the guard
guard who goes there
so cold oh so cold
guard dont worry about him
hes on jareths payroll now
hoggle falls to the ground then picks himself up
hoggle thash right
jareth owes me sumthin
an im here ta collect
they laugh at him then step aside and let him enter
a group of goblins stand in a circle in a corridor
they torment a tiny fuzzy yapping creature with their nipper sticks
the creature gets away from them and goes scurrying down the corridor
the goblins laugh
it turns a corner and starts yapping for all its worth
sarah ludo and didymus pressed against the wall trying to not be noticed
unfortunately the little creature has no sympathy for their plight
it stands at their feet making a ruckus
sarah whispering shut up you little monster
ludo bends down to pet it in the hopes of quieting it
but the creature doesnt want a pet
it sinks its teeth into ludos hand
didymus i fear that this means trouble
the goblins yell and start running down the corridor
sarah run for it
they are off the creature and the goblins at their heels
the three are running for all theyre worth
sarah pulls the watch out of her pocket
it is on the
sarah only a half hour left
weve got to find freddie
yet another group of goblins running right toward them
they stop in their tracks and start running in the opposite direction
the three come careening into the long narrow inner courtyard
balconies look down on it from the floor above
opposite them is a large ornate door
they have a lead on the goblins chasing them but not for long
on one of the balconies a particularly repulsive little goblin laughs sadistically
the three look up and see the goblin with his hands on a huge lever
he pushes it down gleefully and the floor opens up in front of the threesome
it appears to be a bottomless pit too wide to leap across
horrified they look behind them and see the goblins gaining on them
and theyre throwing spears
suddenly there is a triumphant yell from the balcony opposite the repulsive goblin and then a figure leaps off it swinging on a rope
it certainly is
he wrestles with the hideous goblin and in the struggle it falls screaming into the pit
hoggle then grabs the lever and it is not a second too soon
the pursuing goblins are entering the courtyard
the floor closes and the three run to the door
an enraged pursuer aims a spear at hoggle
he is hit
sarah screams as ludo struggles with the door
it wont budge and he begins to smash his body against it
a seemingly half dead hoggle staggers to his feet and throws his body on the lever
he appears to faint from the strain but the weight of his body pushes the lever and the floor opens again
the enraged goblins are stopped in their tracks by the yawning pit
they hurl spears at the threesome but it is to no avail
ludo smashes down the door and they run in
sarah didymus and ludo carrying hoggle enter the room where we have seen jareth and freddie
they lock the door behind them
no one is there and freddies cradle is rocking as if someone had removed him only moments before
ludo places hoggle down and sarah looks feverishly around the room
she spots a door
sarah thats the only way he could have gone
she runs to the door and ludo and didymus follow
i have to face him alone
didymus but my lady
he is interrupted by the sound of goblins in pursuit
they start trying to smash down the door
ludo runs to it and presses his body against it
hoggle moans and didymus and sarah run to his side
hoggle i dont expect ya to fergive me missy but
she puts her finger to his lips
sarah forgive you for what
saving our lives
hoggle but i betrayed ya i gave ya that damned peach
you did the only thing you could do
she looks down at his empty belt
and i see you lost all your treasures in the process
hoggle i dont care if i never sees another treasure again
sarah smiles here
just in case you change your mind
she slips off her mothers ring and presses it into hoggles hand
he is overwhelmed and sarah smiles at his pleasure
hoggle and jareth said ya could never love me
sarah jareth doesnt know everything
she leaps to her feet and hoggle moans
sarah take care of him didymus
didymus ill guard the valiant hoggle with my life
the goblins give the door a particularly loud smash and ludo presses against the door even harder
she runs to the other door and stops to look back at them
sarah no maiden could have wished for nobler knights
and she is gone
sarah enters an overwhelming room with many staircases balconies and doorways at different heights and at all kinds of strange angles that obviously have no relation to what we know
her knees buckling from vertigo
then she gasps
jareth is sitting on the wall with all the ease of a fly
jareth ive been expecting you
sarah stumbles and falls into the room ending up on the ceiling
she tries to adjust to being upside down
sarah wheres freddie
she has to look down and sideways to see jareth and it is clearly grueling
jareth hes right there
and he points to one of the stairways that juts out at a right angle from the wall
freddie is climbing up the stairs happily but from sarahs point of view it looks like he will fall when he gets to the top
sarah screaming freddie
freddie gets to the top but doesnt fall instead he ends up crawling up the wall
sarah sighs with relief and closes her eyes
this sends her reeling and she ends up in one of the archways
she tries to orient herself but there is no up no down no sideways
and the baby is about to crawl off a balcony
sarah screams and jareth laughs
he begins a song that tells sarah she never really understood what was gain on
nothing is what it appears to be not even things like up and down
freddie in the most precarious looking situation yet at the top of a staircase
he hesitates to crawl down and to lure him jareth creates a ball out of thin air and throws it to the baby
of course it bounces up
and all the while his song is taunting sarah
she turns away from him and looks into the large mirror framed in the archway
she sees endless sarahs
and while shes looking the first reflection runs to the left the reflection behind that to the right and so on all the way down the line
and sarahs still standing there
she falls backwards and ends up standing on the floor watching freddie chase his ball across the ceiling
jareth dances on the wall now as he is about to finish his song
and there is freddie on one of the balconies facing out of the rotunda
if he falls off that hell really fall
sarah runs up the opposite wall and finds that there is sheer space between her and the baby
the only way to reach him is to jump
she looks at jareth who grins at her then at freddie who is teetering on the edge
as jareth comes to the end of the song there is nothing to do but jump
she looks at jareth and cant repress a grin of her own
sarah like the man said nothing is what it appears to be
sarah falls right on to a magnificent huge bed
opposite her jareth sits in a chair
freddie wrapped in a blanket is gurgling on his lap
sarah reaches into her pocket and pulls out the watch
it is a few minutes before
jareth stands up
jareth theres still time
he gestures to a clock on the wall that shows the same time as her watch
he places freddie into a cradle and comes over to the bed
he looks down at her
jareth besides im no longer interested in having a little goblin prince
ive decided id much rather have a queen
he looks into her eyes for a moment
sarah doesnt look away
instead she slowly eases herself off the bed and stands facing him
sarah archly a queen
have you chosen anyone i know
she glides by him and walks to the window
jareth chuckles appreciatively
jareth youve come a long way little girl
sarah looks out at the labyrinth
sarah i certainly have
she turns to face him
jareth yes i can see it in your eyes
he moves closer to her no one else has ever made it this far in the labyrinth no one else has ever been worthy
he takes her hand and brings it to his lips
she smiles down at him
sarah whats your offer
jareth stands quickly and looks at her
she certainly has come a long way
jareth why everything
youll rule by my side
the chance to spend my life surrounded by repulsive goblins
the chance to torment innocent creatures
jareth shaking his head
the chance to never have a care in the world to never have to do anything that you dont want to do
sarah looks at him
sarah anything else
jareth smiling why me
sarah surreptitiously eyes the clock
there is about a minute left
she glides away from the window and tries to position herself closer to freddie
sarah and what if im not interested
jareth reacts with surprise for a moment then shakes his head
i know you i know what you want
sarah well ive got news for you jareth
she makes a beeline for the cradle
sarah i dont want you
shes almost at the cradle but jareth grabs her arm and stops her
sarah shocked enraged why you miserable creep
jareth has hold of her arms but she breaks away and hauls off and punches him in the jaw
jareth steps back stunned
sarah scoops up the screaming freddie
sarah how could you do this to an innocent baby
jareth stands rubbing his jaw snivelling stunned
jareth you hit me
sarah freddie in her arms goes right up to him
sarah and id like to do more
she is furious and wants to hit him again badly
since she has the baby in her arms she makes do with kicking him hard in the shin
jareth howls and grabs his leg
sarah i wouldnt want you if you were the last
goblin on earth
the white bird flies through the window and lands on sarahs shoulder
jareth puts his hands on his ears
jareth dont say that
but it is too late he starts shrinking
jareth look at me
whining how could you do this to me
before sarahs eyes jareth turns into an undersized ineffective snivelling little goblin
the features are those of a goblin but still recognizably jareth
jareths quarters where didymus tends hoggle and ludo still blocks the door
jareth vo whiney scream why does everything have to happen to me
they look at each other and suddenly ludo realizes that the goblins are no longer trying to break down the door
the three start to laugh
hoggle proudly she did it
jareth the bratty little goblin is throwing a tantrum
jareth nobody ever cares about what i want
the walls and floor shake so from his pounding fists and feet that a crack opens up right in front of sarahs feet
she looks at the clock and the minute hand moves to the
she looks at freddie
theres nothing to do but jump into the void
the clock begins to strike
sarah ok freddie
time to go bye bye
sarah and freddie spinning through the dark starry sky
the striking of the clock continues
close on sarah and freddie
sarah pulls him closer lovingly
and they go on spinning
sarah is lying face down on the floor
she comes to slowly and tries to sit up
groaning she rubs her head where it bumped on the corner of the open drawer
she tries to focus blinking her eyes
sarahs pov her eyes slowly focus on freddies crib
when she can see she gasps
freddies not there
the side of the crib is down and the baby is nowhere to be seen
she leaps to her feet woozily
still rubbing her head she staggers out into the hallway
sarah looks down the hallway and suddenly her face breaks out into a delighted grin
sarahs pov little freddie is crawling slowly but determinedly into sarahs room
when he gets to her bed he uses all his strength to pull himself up on to his feet by holding on to the bedspread
be then holds his hand out trying to reach something
sarah makes her way toward her room delight and wonder on her face
sarah stands in the doorway looking down at freddie
sarah softly thats quite a journey you took freddie
freddie looks up at her and makes a sound
he continues straining and we see that what he is reaching for is lancelot sarahs bear
sarah smiles and lifts freddie up
she sits on the bed freddie on her lap and hands him the bear
freddie takes it happily
sarah smiling you earned it
she kisses his head and rocks him gently
then she gazes out the window at the stars
the light shines from sarahs window
the white bird flutters down from the starry sky
it perches in the tree beside the path
