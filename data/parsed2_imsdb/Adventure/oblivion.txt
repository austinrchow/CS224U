written by william monahan current revisions by karl gajdusek based on the story by joseph kosinski draft march
huge mountains destroyed structures
buildings enveloped by flows of earth
awe inspiring beauty
they arrived almost half a century ago
aliens scavs whatever you want to call them
their idea of how do you do was to blow up our moon
giant waterfalls crash where lava cooled through iron and concrete
telephone polls half buried in sand
without her moon the earth went insane
most were killed in the floods as the cities came down as everything caught fire
a year later their ground troops landed to exterminate whoever was left
a station wagon half protrudes from a lava flow
a childs plastic flip flops on the dash
they were probably surprised what we were willing to do to survive
we used the nukes
we won the war but lost the planet
low on the horizon the tet rises with the sun
its a white tetrahedron six sided space station that circles the earth once a day like an artificial moon
humanity had to flee the earth
we had to unlearn what it meant to call something our home
now we live on the tet our man made moon
a temporary home before the next step
everyones there now
well almost everyone
an alarm chirps
a mans hand reaches out of bed silences it
the man swings his feet onto the floor
he sits with his face in his hands waking up
we hear a shower running
he looks up
a woman showers near him only steamed glass walls between them
she sees him smiles at him without modesty
he looks back at her
we watch a familiar morning routine bathroom
the man flicks on a light stares at himself in the mirror
this is jack
early s a good face that enjoys rugged living
tan and weathered skin
his eyes are curious kind almost child like
the woman squeezes in next to him victoria
s a tom boy shock of red hair towel around her neck
she brushes her teeth
victoria watches the coffee drip bites toast
jack lets warm water blast him in the face
jack pulls a worn high tech workmans suit from a locker revealing a photo taped to the door its of him and victoria younger in a white walled high tech
corridor smiling eager at the camera
he stares at it for a moment closes the locker door
victoria hands jack his coffee
he kisses the top of her head heads out to work
he walks out onto the deck of a futuristic home perched feet in the air literally above the clouds
as our minds are blown jack moves away from the glass walled home towards his bubbleship a futuristic cross between a bell helicopter and a jet fighter and we crane
up up up
incredible vertigo until were looking down at this impossible structure
jack climbing into his ship
the sky stretches to infinity above roiling planetary cloud cover
the bubbleship streaks through our frame dropping faster than free fall
through the canopy of the bubbleship the cloud cover below seems to fall upwards at us thats how fast were diving
theres a small worn bobble head on the dash which vibrates with the ship
jack is un phased by the drop touches a few controls
good morning jack
ill be your flight attendant for the day
this is day
three thousand two hundred and twenty five in case you were wondering
jack is running instruments
a day at work
today we will be running support on five resource gatherers working the seaboard
coordinates coming to you
please do confirm
on jacks heads up display five icons glow to life
yeah i got em
you got em bob
the bobblehead bobs
victoria watches the bubbleships icon on a screen
shes now wearing a work jumpsuit open over a mans undershirt
she has a natural ease with tech and stress
she sips her coffee punches up a feed multi tasking with cool
drone perimeter defense is intact although one went offline last night
hows the drop
oh you know
same ole same
in front of victoria almost a hundred years of technological advances
most prominent a map overlaid with environmental meteorological radiation levels
other screens stream cam footage from the bubbleship
alright youre blind in five four three
intercut with jack in the bubbleship
jack watches the cloud wall rush up at him
you should come with me sometime
no thank you
have a nice ride
the bubbleship hits clouds goes completely blind
just vapor and water hammering the canopy like bullets
on the heads up display gps numbers roll
the readouts deal with climate terrain below
even in this hell jack takes the controls starts to pilot on instruments
one of victorias boards flashes
she squints as a large mass forms near jacks ship
jack you got some weather on your five closing
the bubbleship is vibrating buffeted
what do you call this
what does a storm look like inside a storm
the wall of weather comes out of the wind and rain from behind jacks ship simply eats it up
suddenly jacks going end over end helpless
warning lights flash
jack punches controls that wont respond
humming to himself ive got sunshine
on a cloudy day
when its cold outside ive got the month of may
victoria watches the readouts helpless
i guess youd say
what can make me feel this way
a little tense okay bob
need you to work with me here
in the bubbleship jack works the display literally smacks a panel with his fist
suddenly the bubbleship surges with power
jack regains control as the bubbleship bursts through low clouds hurtling down past turbulence into
the sky above a beautiful desolate planet
mysterious black sand dunes active volcanoes swirling orange and gold sediment steaming bright blue hot springs and rich brown craters
jack takes a moment to marvel at it all
under his breath talkin bout my girl
jack shifts the bubbleship in the distance a series of resource gatherers on the horizon
essentially titanic vacuums sucking up the oceans
in front of her console victoria charts the gatherers and the patrol arcs of their defensive drones
one blinks stalled
okay weve got another drone downed last night
numbers fire across the heads up
jack touches a button
a bar gauge begins to fill like a street racer turning on the nox before dragging
would you like to set a course to reserve fuel
bar gaucre hits top
jack punches it
jack vibrates in his seat pinned back
the ship screams over the surface following the signal
now a huge crater opens up in front of him which he drops into barely missing an edge
which seems to have architecture to it
the ship skims close along the walls which are revealed to be rows and rows of stadium seats half buried in sand
were in giants stadium new jersey
old news to jack
he surveys below
i see it looks like full mid flight impact
what was its last destination
below through blowing dust we see a drone a spherical mechanical weapon plunged into the sand
yo no se
its not transmitting
checking the map tet coverage will go live in minutes
jack stares forward at a huge broken sign home of the world champions
you know i actually read about this game
giants are literally on their own seven with seconds on the clock
please do not reminisce on my comm thank you very much
he puts the bubbleship into a soft descent
victoria observes it on her console
i have no eyes in the sky for another ten minutes
do not land
seen from inside a stadium tunnel the bubbleship lands thirty yards from the drone moors itself by setting spikes from its skids
blowing sand whips around both
jack grabs an old yankees cap from between the seats and slides it on backwards
he hoists a weapon a carbine sized gun on a sling and checks its charge as he slides the door open
hes blasted with sand and wind which now suddenly still like a freight train thats passed
qb lets off this mile high bomb
the weathers fast and erratic like this
as jack starts moving towards the drone a heavy mist forms shrouding it in grey
theres almost no sound just jacks feet on earth
the thing just sails the length of the field
victoria anxiously checks a screen the arc of the tets vision still not covering jacks location
jack i have no scope
the tet is still offline
a faint sound on the wind
like a whine
and at the one yard line
its all over
lights connected to the ships two automatic guns reach from the hull of the bubbleship backlighting jack as he reaches the downed drone
the drone a spectacular piece of technology has landed hard half buried in the sand
the basic electronics are still humming cycling
but the guys too eager
he starts running it back
everyones yelling fall down just fall down
jack goes to his knees examining it his hands expertly locate an empty tube like space on the side of the drone
the fuel cell has been taken
what do you mean taken
was it a malfunction
jack looks at the casing
beaten pried open
he glances at the ground around him the dark tunnels
from inside a caved in tunnel entrance jack looks small vulnerable
something watches jack
its a master drone too
looks like it was hit mid flight managed to limp its way here
watch my back im starting field repair
intercut victoria at sky tower
glances at the arc of the tets vision still six minutes away
bob im going to need a cell
at the bubbleship
an exterior compartment opens revealing spare parts etc
at the same time a small rover an ball shaped independent gopher rolls free from the ship sprouting wheels
jack you need to get out of there
bring it home to the shop
jack has a panel open
he pulls a lead from the sleeve of his suit connects it to a board
we see flight data transfer to the bubbleship
so the guy keeps running
yards and bam
he gets pasted
ball goes loose
jack you know they can weaponize a fuel cell
now a driver shoots out of the tool cuff of his suit
and wouldnt you know it giants recover start running it back
im reading the whole central core off alignment you dont have the necessary tools
jacks got an arm and half his chest inside
he takes his chewing gum presses it in next to a board
systems go green on victorias console
hold on what did you just do
calling to the ship bob i said i needed
he turns to find that the rover is already there a deuterium fuel cell sitting in its payload bay
a sound now reaches jack
distant an animal in pain
jack listens but its gone
he slots the cell
a hummmm as the drone powers up systems coming online
jack looks around at the stadium
can you imagine it
people on their feet
everyone yelling go
he sets his gun against the drone raises his arms running in a circle making the crowd roar sound
intercut victoria listening to his stadium cheer sound over the comm
she rests her head in her hands
the empty ruined structure stares back
reality returns sadly
he reaches for the open fuel cell door
hesitates hating what comes next
and that sound comes again
an animals whimper
jack stands at the tunnel entrance shining a light into the depths
the sound is clear now a low whimpering
jack makes his way down the tunnel carefully
ahead the tunnel meets the circular tunnel that rings the stadium
his light plays over the silty floor finds a dog
it cowers in a corner
hey there boy
jack moves forward hand out
you got nothing to be scared of buddy
the dog suddenly scurries away into the dark behind jack a huge form rises
we see grey skin teeth
and jack hears its heavy labored breath
jack sprints full speed
the animal a giant emaciated hairless bear comes surging out of the darkness lumbering after him
jack tears back down the tunnel the bears form almost filling the tunnel behind him
we hear jack before we see him
a loud ahhhhhhhh
as jack comes streaking out of the tunnel the bear on his heels
view from above jack streaks down the field
the giant bear closing
he can see the drone in front of him the fuel cell door still hanging open
he puts on a burst of speed but stumbles sliding on his chest arm outstretched towards the drone as the bear leaps
he reaches flips the drones fuel cell door shut
it surges up weapons powering up and rrrrrrrrrrrrip
it opens up with white plasma fire on the bear which seems to go nova in mid air disintegrating to black ash which covers jack
jack stumbles to his feet
drone now wheels on him
its smoking red hot cannons inches from his face
jack averts his gaze as the drone scans jack
breathing hard hating this moment
with its ganglia still hanging out it doesnt seem to be processing
and then just as quickly the drone rockets up into the sky and is gone
jack falls to his knees in the sand exhausted
only now realizing that victoria has been calling his name
what the hell was that
the tets scanners finally giving her a high rez thermal view of jack
her display burning red from the residual plasma fire
call in number for service up top
its practically got its motherboard and half its hydraulics hanging out
under his breath but it still wants to kill everybody
jack what happened
nowtrudging to the ship ill see you at the house later
you want anything
anything else that doesnt exist
he leans against the ship
its a nice thing to hear
well if you want anybody else youre out of luck
he boards the bubbleship
we only have two more months jack
please try to resist the urge to do something stupid
theres no other service signals
a relationship off balance
she wants him home
the captured drone data right there in front of him on the heads up
hes too curious
that master drone was hit right over mid town
same area as the one we lost last night
jacks bubbleship locked and armed sits atop a ridge against the bruised and lightning fractured sky
jack scans the horizon with his binocs past deserted landscape an early iron framed skyscraper that came down semi intact on its side
he lowers the binocs glances upwards to where one of the huge resource gatherers blots out half the sky breath taking
its hovering over what is left of a subsided harbor a few blasted and rusted hulks of ships
the water level has dropped by a kilometer
the gatherer is sucking up salt water harvesting the elements essential to create deuterium heavy hydrogen
at the top of the giant machine drones work tirelessly ferrying containers of deuterium energy up into the sky
jack raises the binocs snaps a few photographs
theres no drone signal there
what are you doing jack
one day when we get to mars someone will want to know about this
from someone who was here
he stares at the huge columns of water draining upwards
do we have to take it all
its not doing anyone any good here
jack nods starts to turn away when something glints on the horizon
he raises the binocs pans to a gallows like structure
he zooms but it is still unclear
jack without a signal youre looking for a needle in a haystack
i think weve had enough excitement for one day
jack is at the back of the bubbleship throwing levers
actually ive got a bit of a problem with a gyro here call you when ive fixed it
he releases a catch pulls a white rectangular case from a slot in the bubbleship
he kneels down hands working expertly producing a full unfolding motorcycle
as jack locks the rear wheel in place the bike humms to life
he gets on and opens up the throttle rooster tailing off
the bikes electric but it moves
jack rides over what used to be the sea bed soaking up the thrill of catching top speed air over embankments of black sand
completely carefree enjoying himself like a man who is utterly and completely alone
something was here
a large metal beam has been propped onto rocks stretching over
a collapsed section of earth
this was the source of the light reflection
jack stares down into the hole
he pops a flare drops it in
it comes to rest far below next to the unmistakable form of a drone
there you are
an instant of black
and were suddenly looking at jack through alien binoculars
high tech symbol readouts changing
something is watching him
inside the hole looking up
a climbing rope spills towards camera
we descend with jack all the way down into the hole the light receding above
he touches his suit and a light array blazes on illuminating the walls passing by
jack drops down through what used to be a roof
into the reading room of the new york public library
vast ruined the far end totally collapsed like a sky scraper fell on it
he reaches the silty floor the flares burning light illuminating the room
he stares at the expanse of shelves that line the walls stripped and empty
he turns to his task kneels by the drone
the things a wreck
a metal shaft protrudes from a crease
jack marvels at the accuracy of the shot
he carefully reaches out slides the fuel cell door open
again the fuel cell is missing
vika youre not going to believe
white noise on the comm
theres no signal down here
the static bubbleship sits inert
finally she turns to the tet comm
a station reserved for high tech long range communication with the home base
a status indicator and a screen for text communication
mission this is lieutenant victoria kohl requesting drone intercept at coordinates sending now
her audio goes through a scrambling process then is uploaded where a few seconds later its receipt is acknowledged status approved
she stares up at the map sees one of the drones turn towards jacks location
she settles back watching
jack looks up and sees how the drone was brought down above it is a twisted tangle of chain mesh and cables strung between two structures a drone trap
movement from the darkness
jack spins his gun coming off his back in a fluid motion
just the empty cavern the wreckage at the end
jack squints at
a wall of books on the shelves beyond the wreckage
he steps forward
almost falls into a giant hole
he raises the flare off the ground illuminating a void where the entire floor has imploded down seven more stories
whats left is a pit with a building sized ton of twisted metal hanging over it
a single bent girder still spans the hole
jack tracks the possibilities
steps out onto the girder
he reaches up to the suspended wreckage to balance
a hundred tons of twisted metal just moved an inch above him
best leave that alone
he balances inching across this metal tightrope
finally reaching the other side
jack approaches the wall of books hundred of them
he kneels lifts one blows dust off the cover the he steps back admiring it
a bear trap hidden in the debris closes around his leg piercing armor and flesh
jack has a second to process and a cable rises from the debris goes taught
jack is dragged through the dust inhumanly fast headed towards a darkened alcove
he activates a laser cutter on his cuff slices through the cable which whips away as he brings his rifle up fires rounds into the darkness
half animal half electronic
somethings in pain but not retreating closing on him
jack slices down cutting loose the claw and runs for it back towards the hole as his girder is yanked away in front of him pulled into the void below
jack doesnt slow reaches the edge leaps
a moment jack hanging in space gravity clawing at him falling
slamming into the far side
for a moment dangling over the fall then jack hauls himself over the far side
alien forms emerge from recesses
we get glimpses of feathers oily flesh metal
they close as he reaches his line clips in and rises automatically the suit riding the line up at neck snapping speed
the line trembles under his weight and stress
a knife improvised from bone and sheet metal enters the frame and cuts the line
jack has a second to feel the slack hit
and then hes falling
impacts the ground
cant get his air
staggering wildly to his feet forms closing
suddenly a drone blasts down through the ceiling hole
its lights turning night to day its cannons firing
in the strobing flash of canon fire we see scavs incinerated
metal and hair fry to ash as the insect like creatures scream
other shots impact walls
fire and plaster dust fills the space
jack shields himself from the debris as the drone ceases firing whirls on jack
the same awful moment as it scans him
then it lifts away is gone as quickly as it arrived
and with its departure the darkness comes again
silence whatever was here is now gone
jack takes in the destruction for a hard beat the ash of an alien burning paper twisting in the air
he looks up towards the light above
a long ways above
jack appears dirty faced filthy and frustrated crawling lugging his own weight up through the sink hole
finally back to the surface
he shakes himself off
notices his bike has been taken
that was my bike
he kicks at the dust the rocks curses at the pain as hes reminded of his injured leg
he stares at the long walk ahead the wall of wind and rain that now hits him soaking him
he starts walking
the debris in the air makes for spectacular sunsets
jacks bubbleship bursts from the low clouds carrying jack home after the long day
we see the planetary ring formed by the rubble from the destroyed moon
jack marvels at the ring thoughtful
but then checks his read outs
victoria knows what hes looking for
check your seven
jack touches his controls and the bubbleship canopy revolves so jacks facing away from the direction hes traveling in
low on the horizon the tet floats in the sky
its setting glows a dull orange like a harvest moon
shes leaning back in her command chair her feet propped on the console also staring out at the tet
in jacks face a curious mixture of nostalgia and confusion
this small metal planet is his home
see you back here tomorrow
same time same channel
he punches the throttle and screams across the tops of the clouds through the beautiful light arriving at
the glass walls of the sky tower reflect the bubbleship as it lands
hooks catch the landing rockers of the bubbleship and lock it down against the buffeting wind
jack drops the last piece of his environment suit
he touches a button and warm water sprays down
through the glass he can see victoria inside the sky tower
she nods at him a tense welcome home
he nods back
there is no privacy in the sky tower
as the glass walls go opaque with steam he closes his eyes the water running over his face
pops of memories go through his imagination sky tower
early in their tour victoria girlishly jumps on the sofa with a pint of ice cream laughing
jack watches victoria sleep brushes hair from her face affectionate
and the memory
seems to distort
suddenly becoming the new york skyline seen through a cheap telescope
jack pulling away from the telescope happy turning to
a brunette woman staring back at him
jack starts snapping out of the memory
rows and rows of shelves mainly empty now
jack and victoria have gone through almost all of what they needed for a year tour
jack grabs a container of water
jack starts to hang up his workmans suit pauses to stare at the photo of a younger him and victoria on the tet
they look so eager so innocent
he shifts slightly to where he can see out to the tet itself sinking below the horizon
the area is devoted to drone repair
lifts parts shelves odds and ends of gear and weaponry tables of tools a written off drone at the back
jack comes in glances at his newest arrival the self beached drone
even deactivated it looks like trouble like pure evil
he opens a drawer slips the education of henry adams into the drawer shuts it
we finally see the whole thing
it couldnt be more comfortable although it continually vibrates in the wind victoria is sitting reading her own work notes
in the background chaplins modern times plays silently on a large screen
jack goes up behind her and kisses her on the head
not looking at him youre not supposed to bring up surface items
jack sips water then waits even longer before
im not supposed to bring them in the house
he exchanges his water for a glass of something stronger and goes and sits down
i tried to reach you earlier
if were going to be an effective youre right
then you cant just jack leaps up only to return a second later with a small bundle held together by an old rag
he hands it to her pleased watching her reaction
she opens it to reveal a small green seedling in a pocket of fresh rich soil
her eyes play over it
where did you find this
so its okay when i bring you something
but if i she moves suddenly opening one of the glass doors of the sky tower and heading outside where she holds the seedling away from her body off the
edge lets it drop
she comes back in washes her hands in the sink upset
was that really necessary
i know you think im a stickler for the rules but you have no idea what sort of toxins could be in something like that
im sorry i dont think its funny
it was just a plant victoria
thats not the point
we have two more months and the last thing we need is you putting it all at risk
he shakes his head grimaces as he limps away
he admits it with a glance offers no explanation
she comes over to him examines the wound professionally
it is tiny but state of the art
victoria seriously examines his wound cleaning it out
its no small wound but theyre less concerned than we would be
victoria pulls on gloves opens cabinet and removes a watery substance as well as a small electronic wand
she smears the substance onto his wound a healant
this is gonna pinch a little
she activates the wand shines ultra violet light onto the substance
a beat then he bends over in pain
through the healant we see the flesh begin to knit and repair
skin and sinew literally regenerating
serves you right
she kisses him on the forehead turns away
wine is involved candles
victoria is mellower much
this is a couple who knows each others differences and admires them
this isnt an argument
im not saying you cant go into your caverns im saying we have a job and if im trying to reach you and youre off on one of your adventures
look they trained me to fix drones
thats my job i get that
but its not what i am
i cant simply do the same thing over and over again every day with that
world down there
toasts the sky and if mission has a better drone tech they can get him to baby sit
he gets up tries out his leg
stiff but healed
its only a little while longer
the gatherers have collected most of the resources we need for mars
pretty soon pretty soon there wont be anything left down there
no more plant life no more water
so forgive me if i want to enjoy it a little before the end
you act like theres not a war going on down there but there is and we cant leave even two of those things alive
they nearly killed you today
they eat in silence for a moment then actually it was like they were trying to
trying to joke guess i look tasty
he goes over to her puts his arms around her
please be careful
if they get to you what happens to me
jack puts a finger to her lips then kisses her
answer the question
jack considers this
then he pulls his shirt off over his head
talk about an infinity pool
the pool is miles in the sky with a glass bottom
the cold wind is constant overhead but heaters flare with the changes in temperature compensating
jack glides graceful underwater his nude form silhouetted against the roiling dark clouds below
he surfaces near victoria whos stayed dressed on the edge with a glass of wine
he kisses her steals a sip of her wine then pushes back into the water looking up at the stars the streaming moon rubble above
can you imagine when we go back up
having a face to face conversation again
i cant believe its finally ending
we made it
jack looks away
its not so bad down here
they certainly dont have anything like this
i wonder what duty i would have pulled
probably programming the mars boats
id have been overhauling the zero g toilets
im serious its dangerous work
i mean you think you have control of the situation
he swims closer
she smiles he presses on
but then you realize there are some things that were never supposed to happen in zero g
just thinking about it i get afraid
she laughs reaches for her wine accidentally knocks the glass which tips over and rolls right off the sky tower
they watch it disappear into the darkness below
ive been happy here
watches water fall from her hand i cant remember zero gravity
here let me show you
he reaches up pulls her into the pool
she screams laughing as she goes in
she surfaces pulling her soaking shirt over her head and tossing it to the side
i should have seen that coming
jack smiles then takes a breath and goes under
he floats face down staring through the bottom of the pool into the lightening stung clouds below
and then victorias form glides underneath him looking up at him smiling
she stops moving and her body rises towards his
he opens his arms and she floats up and against him
they embrace kiss
two bodies intertwined underwater a thousand feet above a roiling thunderstorm
their lips part he pulls back to look at her
but its the brunette woman who stares back at him
jack wakes breathless troubled
he doesnt know this woman who invades his dreams
next to him victoria lies asleep curled in the sheets
shaken he quietly gets up grabs clothes
and goes where he goes when victoria is asleep
jack moves to a bench where he keeps his finds
a few coins a watch a pistol a snow globe showing the nativity
a book the lays of ancient rome
jack produces his newest find from the library the education of henry adams
he opens it
he was three years old when he took this earliest step in education a lesson of color
the second followed soon a lesson of taste
on his eyes as he reads he remembered quite clearly his aunt entering the sick room bearing in her hand a saucer with a baked apple
he puts the book down strangely troubled
the console sits inert unattended
suddenly a blip radiates on the map its origin elsewhere
a nasa shuttle floats in deep space a recognizable design from our time
frozen crystalline dust hangs in the air
the ship is dead
suddenly a panel blips on
other systems go active
the ship is waking up
theres a visible rumble as the engines prime
further back in the hold
rows of delta sleep pods
we close on one
jacks eyes blink open waking from another dream
he sits up troubled
victoria works in her garden
she grows perfect blemishless roses
the roof is open to the sky
victoria makes a small depression in the earth taps three seeds out of a labeled envelope
jack comes through kisses her
then moves off towards his work
dont go out today until we get a signal
jack looks back
shes never said this before
shes genuinely worried
then what would you say in your report
victoria looks away stuck
i cant get to a site fast enough unless im already out there
you know that
he turns disappears through the glass mechanical doors
jack suits up and gets into the bubbleship and for the first time we see the startup procedure
one two three
lights sparkle across the board
jack hits switches
outside protective barriers lower
the stratospheric wind vibrates the bubbleship
what say we have a little fun today bob
the bobblehead vibrates along with the engines
intercut victoria putting on her headset
whats that jack
just thinking id take bob manual for the dust off
feeling the need
a hundred terraformed acres on mars is all you have to think about
victoria stares out from her windows above the clouds
i love you
he waves blows the chocks
the wind whipping off the tops of the clouds instantly grabs the ship hurtles it into the void
with jack just letting the wind twist him and the ship in freefall
loving this feeling
turns professionally to her console
the tet symbol on the screen the count down to tet rise
she opens video streams loses herself in her work
time as indicated
technical officer away on autonomous patrol as of this transmission
border beacons surrounding the radiation sector are operative
victoria takes a sip of coffee turns to another task when again a blip on her map pulls victorias attention back
that signal radiating near jacks position
she swipes up a grid intensifies her sensors
ive got a rogue signal
might just be interference but there shouldnt be anything there
already shes got the signal analyzed on six different screens
im not sure what it is
intercut jack listening to her in the bubbleship
dont be embarrassed theres always a first time
send it over
ill check it out
hits a key
on its way
be careful okay
jacks ship skims over the surface of a deep pool of water
up ahead a waterfall explodes its force into the pool spray and mist already reaching the bubbleship
all right im coming up to the location
jack begins flying slowly up the twelve hundred foot wall of falling water which almost seems to conceal a petra behind its veil
jack reaches the top
jacks pov the spire and observational deck of the empire state building now part of a cliff set in shifted sea bed a gushing river pouring past
jack lands and gets out of the craft grabbing his weapon and yankees cap as he does
he looks around half nervous half in awe that the old girl is still standing
under his breath new york new york
its a wonderful town
the bronx is up and the batterys down
he can hear nothing over the wind and the water
he moves to the balcony edge looks downtown at the sunken city
a venice set in a matrice of rubble and sea bed
he notices an old pay telescope next to him bent and rusted
he puts his eyes to the lenses
he stares at the cent slot on top lost in a deep sense of deja vu
jack youre right on top of it
what do you see
jack starts a circuit of the deck
a pile of old deck chairs in his way he pushes at them with his foot
finds a wire running below them linked to two car batteries hidden under the rubbish
he traces the path of the wire
jack has made an arduous climb to discover a transmitter hooked to an old military repeater and both hooked to
we look up as jack does
the rusted damaged esb antenna atop the building
bob give me audible on this signal
almost immediately from the bubbleship comes the intermittent electronic squack of the signal
at the bubbleship jack watches the frequency analysis of the signal play on his heads up
he touches the screen and the signal goes quiet
what did you find
its an old radio system
its been reactivated
jack looks at the batteries the wire
jack that signals going out over the whole territory
you need to blow the structure
its the empire state its ancient history jack
you know the procedure
he pulls several charges from the bubbleships storage starts to set them
he pauses staring at the railing the old telescope
change of plans
he walks towards the batteries a blade sliding out of the cuff of his suit
he reaches them and severs the lines
the signal dies
the bubbleship lifts off
jack cant help staring down at the observation deck as the ship lifts into the air
jack is in the air troubled
up ahead in the distance we see a large natural ridge
some instruments light up
check your course youre headed right at the border
yeah i may have seen another drone trap
she checks her map
jacks bubbleship is headed straight at a large red swath of territory marked out toxic radiation levels constantly monitored
a small alarm goes off in the bubbleship cabin
youre at the edge of range jack
youre starting to break up
its okay no its not okay
you get in too close that radiation will cook me from the inside before i know it
dont worry im still more than five clicks from the beacons
in the bubbleship
a bigger alarm goes off red skull and crossbones flash across the heads up
jack dives the ship down over huge rocky outcroppings
jack intent on piloting
some garbled sounds
victorias voice barely coming through
what are you out there jack
the signal goes to pure static as jack steers into a steep canyon rock on all sides
barely room to squeeze but jacks not worried
this is all familiar
thats right bob
you know where were going
victoria stares at the screen static hiss low and empty
its not the first time hes done this but she hates it every time
victoria works the panel upping signal boosting reception
the static is again mixed with garbled sounds
she listens confused ups the volume
that signal from the empire state starts again
this time it locks on a loud and continuous electronic pattern
jacks ship emerges from a canyon into a beautiful landscape we have never seen before
this is jacks secret place
trees exist on an island surrounded by clean water
and near the shore a grotto a carved out portion of the hillside supported with scavenged timbers protected by plastic tarps
a ton of gear is piled inside
jack has been scavenging for a long time
the bubbleship lands
jack walks into the structure slapping on a relay from a solar generator
all around are young growing plants including small yellow flowers and their green seedlings the same jack gave to vika
jack kneels down by an old military jammer
he checks a screen the crater lake location is being jammed
victoria sits the repetitive audio of the signal playing from her console
she stares at the empty map the notable absence of the bubbleships icon on it
she keys the comm one last time
jack i really need you online
a record player is taped into his solar power system
an early metal power ballad floats out of the speakers
jack has a basketball hoop lashed to a pole
he shoots hoops by himself the rover retrieves the ball
jack brings a single chair out in front of the water
he sits and with care produces the books hes brought with him
he opens one with burnt edges i remember him as if it were yesterday as he came plodding to the inn door his sea chest following behind him in a
jack is in an obscure state of frustration
he lifts another book the lays of ancient rome how can man die better than facing fearful odds for the ashes of his fathers and the temples of his gods
jack closes the books strangely unsatisfied
on victoria stuck with the audio signal playing
she moves the tet comm hesitates
then keys the control
mission this is lieutenant victoria kohl requesting a link
i may have a situation
a beat while the connection is made then
what is your situation
i have a rogue signal of unknown origin
im sending you a relay
have your technician locate and report
loathe to admit technician is
experiencing technical difficulties
she winces that wasnt the greatest lie
are you still an effective team
yes were an effective team
have your technician locate and report
were happy to be coming home
a long beat
then beat then itll be good to have you back vika
two more months
victoria smiles despite herself
will communicate findings on next tet cycle
victoria clocks off
stares at the border area on the map where she last saw jack
a klaxon goes off in her workspace
for the first time she seems confused as she works the console
she cant immediately figure it out
suddenly she brings up a wide scan for tracking the tet the whole eastern coast of the continent
and something is closing coming over the poles fast
jack folds the page of his book stuffs it in his cargo pocket and walks down to the water sparkling over stones
motion catches his attention
its the rover approaching with the basketball
the rover shifts confused
i was thinking when our tour is up maybe wed stay
we could put in for another wait wait
hear me out
no dont throw that thats a
the rover turns around
jack smiles at the poor machines confusion
the smile dying
this is serious
maybe you should go and i should stay
the rover leaves obedient
jack watches it go sad
hes spoken the words
he lies back on the bank looks at the clouds rolling overhead
i should stay
it climbs a gantry towards a shuttle
pov looks over sees a younger victoria who smiles back nervous
a glass carapace
a womans face inside
the same brunette woman
her eyes open she smiles with love
jacks pov spins as a scav looms through orange light and dust snarling with its electronic squeal
jacks eyes snap open
it is much later in the day
he scrambles to his feet breathing hard remembering something
what appears to be a meteor streaks across the sky leaving a trail of flame and white smoke
jack grabs his binocs and traces the meteor path
resolves it just barely as the shuttle crashing down
it disappears over a rise a beat then a fiery bob
lets get going
the bubbleship is already powering up by the time jack piles in
he touches a control and the ship shoots up into the air
jack sets a course towards the smoke on the horizon
vika did you get that
an object hit near here
where the hell have you been
jacks silent not wanting to lie
intercut victoria looking at streaming info from tet
tense professional its an external
an alien ship
its a god damn scav vessel in the western valley
i saw it through optics in the last minute
im not sure it was alien
turn around jack
the drones will handle the situation
the dronesll kill anything that moves
just for once wait for your orders on this one jack
this is serious
jack is silent unsure
the crash site growing closer
this is your control
you heard me
another hard beat
jack hating this but
ill report when i get to the site
in the bubbleshtp
bob seems to shake his head
sotto to bob what are you looking at
victoria stares at her comm
this has never happened
a mountainous area of what was once sea bed
smoky orange fire blows across the ruined landscape
a fire in a dust storm
a gust now reveals
the crashed nasa space shuttle with the name odyssey on its fractured hull
jack is circling the wreckage looking down
im here and its definitely one of ours
im not confirming this from the tet
im confirming it
im right here
vika works her displays scanning wanting to keep him safe
the wreckage has strewn out thousands of flaming pieces of debris all which register heat signatures
this thing is ancient one of the old pre war shuttles
jacks pov the wreckage
the ships guts are strewn across the earth
several pod like canisters strewn around more fixed into the burning wreckage
jack touches down rolling out of his bubbleship even before its settled
he heads straight into the burning wreckage into hell
heat searing his eyes disorienting him
all around metal pops and groans as it distends
he moves through metal panels dodging flames and burning debris searching wildly
jack sees what looks like a survivor
hauls it over to discover its only an empty nasa jumpsuit
but beyond that
a delta sleep pod split wide open
its interior empty
jack moves on finds another pod presses his face against the glass
a human face on the other side
a man sleeping
a fuel explosion plumes into the dark sky
jack stumbles on tracks another pod literally on fire
beyond that a whole portion of the ship is semi intact the hull ripped lengthwise
jack tracks a burnished steel cylinder with radioactive markings locked in strong moorings
and near that another pod still locked in the ships wall
jack moves to it wiping away soot and grime pressing his face close and sees her
shes asleep her face lit by moving firelight
jack is stunned
eyes dart to readouts shes alive
confused amazed moved
he puts a hand out towards the glass of the pod
behind jack plasma rounds impact the pod with the man in it the metal going nova collapsing
cannon fire erupts all around him
two drones settle on the site their weapons kicking out energy locking on and destroying pods
theyre firing on the ship
vika its one of ours
victoria stares at her screens perhaps for the first time in her life frozen
jacks voice blares over speakers
there are people here and theyre killing them
victoria opens her mouth to respond
a drone passes right over jack locks into position lining its cannons on the pod with the woman in it
jack moves between the drone and the pod
the drone hesitates
weapons literally red hot from repeated fire
the drone shifts again fast looking for its shot
jack counters keeping his body between the drone and the pod
get out of here
a moment of insane bravado jack un shoulders his weapon strafes the drone with gunfire which knocks it back
it re centers weapons chugging with energy
staring at the feeds
a screen catching a half image of jack firing at the drone
shes absolutely still holding her breath
jack stares at the drone at certain death
well what the hell are you waiting for
and suddenly the drone moves on canons live searching on into the wreckage annihilating other pods
on jack chest heaving
an instant of black shuttering back to cross hair pov we suddenly see jack through cross hairs tracking him as he shields the delta pod with his body dragging it
towards the bubbleship
a high tech high powered rifle rests in two alien armored hands
like a metal coated insect tarsus barbed feet of a fly
the alien begins to depress the trigger
then another tarsus presses the barrel down
shifting over close on an alien
our first real look still too close to truly comprehend
thick stubbled hair armored with metal bones a head dress of authority
behind layers of dusted cracked goggles the older alien eye
jack reaches the bubbleship heaves the delta pod onto the carrier which immediately secures it with armatures designed to carry damaged drones
jack steals another look at the sleeping face of the woman
he touches the glass wiping away soot and dust
the bubbleship flies up and up the delta sleep pod securely hanging from its belly carrying jack and this mysterious woman away into the evening sky
the wind is wild and brutal
as the bubbleship touches down clamps snap on the landing skids
jack is in motion bursting out of the ship
he glances up
victoria stands behind the glass of the sky tower living room staring at him
he releases the armature
hauls the pod with him towards the house
hammers on the glass
victoria obeys opens the glass doors
wind fills the living room as jack hauls the pod in
then victoria touches a control and the walls seal
the drones tried to kill her
they destroyed the other survivors
well it didnt recognize her
its programmed she came off a nasa shuttle
the drones were specifically targeting the pods i dont know what the machinery did or didnt do
whos the machinery now victoria
victoria stares at him
then retreats from the question into the task at hand
she kneels by the pod
go get the cutter and a breather and my big bag
the pods been damaged shes not doing well lets get her out of there
victoria almost holds back but
this has to be reported
stares at her
i know it does
and when we report it well also report that drones slaughtered the other human survivors from one of our ships
see what they make of that
he goes for the equipment
victoria stares at the womans face deeply unsettled
jack returns with victorias bag and firing up a cutter
right there be careful
jack directs the blue arc towards a seal
the pod depressurizes with a sudden exhale of dead air
jack pulls back the pod door
inside the woman lies in a gauzy sleep suit
her hair is matted
her body looks frail her skin translucent veins dark lips blue like a drowning victim
vika pulls her feeding tube takes her pulse checks her eyes lifting the lids
lift her up we have to get some air into her
jack gets his arms around the woman pulling her upwards
fluid seeps from her mouth
and suddenly shes alive coughing spewing fluid across jack and the floor
he sets her down as she painfully wretches then sucks in air
her eyes flutter open
shes suddenly violently ill again
instinctively jack goes to hold her no
let her get the fluid out
the woman stops heaving
looks up at both of them
she tries to stand disoriented by the glass walls the infinite vertigo that surrounds them
she falls to her knees and stares with amazement down into the clouds
jack kneels beside her puts a hand on her shoulder
youre in a skytower on earth
victoria gives a sharp look at jack
now completely exhausted the woman slumps into unconsciousness
jack catches her
victoria comes close slides an oxygen breather mask over her face
we need to get her cleaned up
a bizarre and almost beautiful tableau all three together under the water jack holding the unconscious woman like a child
the warm water spraying over their three forms soaking the womans gauzy suit which clings to her body
water running across jack and victorias faces their open eyes locked on each other
the water finally stops
we have to get her up to the tet
i dont have the facilities here
once shes stable
the glass door slides open behind them
whats going on
he shakes his head
he has no idea
the woman lies in a bed
victoria checks her readouts adjusts her uv drip
she glances over her and realizes that the womans eyes are open staring at her
victoria turns offers the woman some water
youve been in a very bad crash
your ship came down
this disturbs the woman
she tries to sit up
what about the others
how did you get out
whats your name
the woman julia sinks back down exhausted
you need to rest quietly
youve been in delta sleep for a long time
julia takes that in
looks down at her arm where victoria has just slid a needle under her skin
she stares at her almost afraid
victoria depresses the plunger
seen from afar
the sky tower a lonely refuge in a roiling storm turning on its axis like a weather vane and we plunge down
down and down to the base of the skytower to see
an alien battered by wind rags blowing raises its mask to the sky
looking up towards the tower
it wears the distinctive head dress that we have seen before
victoria is very subdued poking at food
both very aware of the woman sleeping in the infirmary
tomorrow ill report that we have her
jack nods but wont look at her
deep in thought
what do you want from me jack
this isnt just a shakespeare sonnet a buffalo nickel some vase
its a greek funeral vase
which i want my ashes in incidentally
victoria collects the dishes heads for the kitchen
i just think we need to know why
this isnt why were here
this is just what we have to do before our real lives begin
weve given them five years and now we get to go home
so just leave this alone
its not our job
and what if i cant
they stare at each other each obscurely frightened
julia sleeps a mask taped to her face oxygen hissing
jack watches her
now cleaned and dry theres a natural earthy freckled beauty to her
air passing peacefully through her lips now returned to color
jack reaches out to brushes hair from her face
he notices the outline of a necklace with a pendant under her nightgown
victoria sets dishes in a dishwasher
she can see jack in the infirmary staring at julia
drone sits in its hub repaired
jack replaces a panel moves to a laptop and activates the drone
it powers up rising fast bringing its canons around
we should be afraid very afraid that something is wrong with it
it scans jack as menacing as ever
but somethings changed in jack
he just stares back at it
then the drone fires itself off into the black clouds disappearing towards the earth below
jack stares after it then he turns looks across empty space to the underside of the glass pool
victoria has just dived in
she swims laps kicking hard bubblestreams peeling across her body
exercise not pleasure
jack stands at the end of the pool watches victoria stoke powerfully towards him
she sees him as she reaches the edge stops looking up at him
this is important something jacks been wanting to say for a long time i read these books of what it was like down here before
he sits his legs dangling into the water
she pulls up close her arms on the side
in this one book i was reading a man describes being a child
he remembers a yellow kitchen a baked apple
that was the world before
your little obsession
what was so wonderful about life on the tet
she looks away
when our time is up next month
i want to put in for one more tour
victoria pushes off from the side drifts back
its almost all gone victoria
i want to be here for the end
she turns resumes swimming laps
hard driving through the water
he watches her for a moment then turns away
victoria comes in from the pool
she can see jack in the bedroom sitting on the bed his back to her
she moves into the infirmary moves to julia and checks her iv drip
she starts to adjust it stops
she stares down at julia
victoria comes in from the infirmary
she opens a closet changes into a night shirt
she turns and grabs him desperate
dont you understand
we have a chance to be on the first boats out to be the first to settle mars raise a family
proof that we are an effective team
she holds his face kisses him willing him to want her as desperately
everything weve wanted is waiting for us up there
i dont know if it is or not victoria
i cant remember
she starts to reply
shakes her head
she grabs blankets and pulls them around herself her back to him her eyes open scared
jack also lies down staring upwards
and then jack asks the dollar do you remember her
victoria doesnt move
stares straight out
wind shakes the skytower and the clouds boil beneath it
jack and victoria sleep next to each other
in the infirmary julia sleeps alone
a machine beeps
were in the deep saturation of jacks dream
images fly by then slow
people enjoying the view
new york city
jack looking through the pay telescope
then turning seeing
julia right next to him smiling up happy
jacks eyes open
that dream again
victorias still asleep next to him
he rises out of bed
jack pads out into the main room
stops when he sees julia risen from the infirmary standing at one of the glass walls of the sky tower staring out
its early early morning
while its dark below the first signs of dark blue and orange sunrise are visible on the horizon
the planetary ring glows with soft golden light
julias pov in the distance the tet is rising faint light on its surface as it crests the planets curve
very close on julia
the image of tet reflected in the corneas of her eyes
shes been crying silently and alone
one hand at her chest
its beautiful isnt it
its your home now
how do you feel
she wipes her eyes
a bit more
what was your shuttles mission
she turns to him watches him carefully in the dim light
and then lying i dont remember
i should get back to the ship
i might be able to find the flight recorder
its pre war
again careful have you ever seen a ship like that
no of course not
this answers something important for julia
i wonder what brought us back
there was a transmission
i dont know who sent it
well never really know without the flight recorder
she says we cant go down there that its too dangerous
he laughs a little shakes his head
funnily enough youve found your man
an awkward beat then how did you know my name
you look like someone i once knew
extending her hand i understand i owe you my life
thank you jack
a weird moment
she breaks away looks back at the tet which now glows a pale orange on the horizon
what happens now
in a few hours the tet will come online
victoria will report your rescue and i imagine theyll send someone down for you
she gestures out to the bubbleship on its pad
you fly that thing
you could say that
she smiles pleased
a twinkle in her eye
dont you want to know
jack and julia are suited up ready to go
the tetis still low and far on the dark horizon silhouetted bythe first signs of sunlight growing in the east
the bubbleships engines start up with their distinctive whine
as they head towards the ship victoria comes out from the house a robe pulled on
what are you doing
ill bring her back before tet rise
we just want to try to find the flight recorder
you cant know everything watching from a mile up
she shouldnt be julia turns on victoria quickly
i feel very well
then coldly she boards the ship
shes the flight officer she wants
to see the wreck of her ship and secure items there
youd want to do the same thing
dont worry well be back before you have to make your report
thats not it
i cant protect you with the tet offline and i just have a very bad
ill be fine
he turns and boards
julia is staring at her through the bubble canopy
the bubbleship rises and then falls off to the side plummeting towards earth
jack pulls the ship out of its dive sets course across the altered earth
julia is staring down a little afraid but darkly fascinated
victorias voice cuts through on the comm
this isnt just about protocol
im trying to understand
ill be home for breakfast
and he switches off the comm
victoria stares at the dead comm
a moment then she slams the panel with her fists
she backs off staring at the panel
they fly in silence
julia gazes down at sights were by now familiar with becoming visible as the first light hits
the craters emaciated seascape
so i guess im around
a hundred years old
what happened next
he gestures towards the moon ring in the sky
the scavs assumed taking out the moon would wipe us out and it almost did
but we re grouped fought back
we beat them in the end
she glances at him
thats if you call nuking half the planet beating anybody
he looks at her shrugs
they fly past a resource gather its column of water lifting from the seas
we harvest seawater to supply the mars colony with the energy we need to live there
were almost done
pretty soon therell be no more water down here
a dry planet
he nods at the tet rising in the distance
whats left of us are up there now ready to go where you were headed mars
acres and a mule
what weve got left
what youve got
julia stares out at the tet
what about you
we were born and raised up there
vikas the a student
im just a tech
i fix things
julia looks at him
something out of the groove
why are you looking at me like that
she stares back down at the landscape
its so beautiful
he looks at her surprised
he thought he was the only one
the bubbleship sits landed amidst the wreckage
a low still fog has condensed leaving visibility low moisture everywhere
while there was light up high theyve descended back into the pre dawn darkness
the rover has detached shining its small light in their direction to help
julia searches fruitlessly
everything from the wreck small enough to carry away has been taken by scavs
every piece of fabric and metal
jack half watches her half tracks the periphery his weapon slung low
victoria sits at her workstation upset
shes got the bubbleship up on the map its cam feed on display
julia still weakened from delta sleep hauls aside debris revealing a metal floor plate unscrewed and discarded
the slot within is empty
its been taken
she backs off upset breathing hard
look it doesnt matter it matters okay
you cant understand
i need that flight recorder
i need to know what happened
you need to know what happened
we should stay close to
she ignores him moves on
deeper in the wreckage she locates the empty moorings that held the steel cylinder jack saw
its also gone
what was it
she stares at him wanting to say something
deciding not to
she leans back against a wall of the shuttle
victoria has tried to ignore the cam feeds working on other things
she glances over then away just as a form passes by one of the cam feeds
victoria checks another readout glances back as two more forms pass by the camera
glimpses of metal and fur
hitting the comm jack
theres something coming your way
jacks bubbleship sits silent
the comm still switched off
suddenly another form moves through our line of sight somethings there and close
with jack and julia
the air still damp
almost no sound
she picks through the remains of the ship
hes staring at her
without looking up youre staring at me
intercut victoria watches as more and more alien figures pass the camera feed
moving towards jack and julias position
julia looks up at jack directly for the first time
he stares at her
how do i know you
on julias face
suddenly her vision racks
jack spins sees emerging out of the mist scavs
a dozen of them
alien tribesmen bristling with weapons war like high tech headdresses
mandibles and claws
terrifying and close
jack reaches for his weapon bringing it around and slam
hes hit from the side by a scav
its armored body bringing him to the ground
he tries to crawl away sees julia grabbed
he twists sees scavs crawling over the bubbleship
in the background the bubbleship blasts off scavs falling off as jack kicks backwards breaking the scavs hold
he rolls away towards his weapon straight into the legs of a giant scav holding an improvised club which now comes down impacting jack
victoria stares at image of the wreck growing smaller as the bubbleship rises
small glimpses of earth moving by then darkness again
jack and julia are tied to a huge scav sled pulled by twelve feral dogs
a combination of old scavenged military hardware and new innovation to adapt to a world without engine power
giant treads roll forward as the dogs strain against metallic harnesses
jacks head lolls to the side
he blinks looks over to see julia next to him unconscious
he tracks up
at the top of the sled a massive alien scav pilots the sled sand whipping through a head dress we recognize the leader
he holds a long whip cracks it over the dogs who haul the sled forward
we slow letting the sled pull away from us into the dark as we travel back towards where we came from reveal
the bubbleships rover has been following
a machine meant for small journeys it rolls inside the tread path left by the sled but it can barely handle the terrain
victoria hears the sound of the bubbleship arriving
she rushes to the glass of the sky tower sees the bubbleship docking itself
no one inside
from far away we see the sled wind up this rocky canyon which opens onto a massive wall of old concrete and steel
something giant and industrial in its time
the sled approaches seems to disappear as it moves under a shadowy outcropping of rock
in the dark underneath huge metal doors
almost complete blackness just the sound of a slow drip of water
in the far distance the howls and chatter of scavs
jacks blood encrusted eyes blink open
irises dilate trying to orient
he raises his head can barely see
he and julia lie in the only pool of light in the room filtering in from a high ventilation shaft
around him in the dark the sense of movement
his eyes adjusting he squints into the dark
theres a form on the edges of the light watching him
jack tenses as the figure
strikes a match on the floor brings the flame to its face revealing
an old man beech
he sucks in on the end of a cigar
for a moment their eyes meet
then the match goes out
dark silhouette again
only the feint orange glow from the cigar
do you have any idea how long ive waited for this
he exhales a stream of smoke into the beam then moves closer into the light
beechs face is lined with age and exposure his skin scarred from battle
his teeth yellowed and crooked but his arms and body are strong
beechs voice is calm with a barely held back malice lurking just under the surface
well let me tell you jack
its been a long time
who are you
where is this
beech inhales again
theres a piercing curiosity to beechs gaze studying him
were deep underground
very deep underground
we were taken by the scavs
tell me jack
have you ever met a scav up close
jack is suddenly aware of other forms in this room
motion on the periphery
no of course not
you just repair the damage keep the drones up and killing
dont ask many questions do you jack
no part of the
beech pulls off the cigar
brutal if you think about it
the way your drones the scavs took everything from us
and if youre working with them interesting jack
youre worried i might be some kind of
jack doesnt respond
a beat then a bank of lights flickers on revealing humans all around them heavily armed
julia groans the light bringing her to
jack moves to protect her tracks ten twenty people
he looks up where rows and rows of men and women stare down from above with undisguised animosity
forty fifty more
at the front a strong battle scared scav sykes hovers on the edge of violence
hes been recently wounded
were not aliens jack
were very much human
jack cant process
human face after human face
of course thats a problem
your drones go for human shapes human voices
we change our shapes change our voices
the drones still kill us but theyre not nearly so aggressive as when they smell a human target
did you ever ask yourself why that is
no theyre programmed to to what jack
you saw it yourself
you almost got yourself blown to bits protecting her
ive been meaning to ask you why did you do that
anyone would have
julia comes around her eyes flickering open she screams looking frantically for an escape
jack grabs her protecting her calming her
beech gets close studies jack what hes doing
beech moves away
jack moves after him and suddenly forty or more weapons lock onto him
sykes closer than any other
im afraid youre not very popular here
beech switches his gaze to julia
welcome back to earth commander
hope you like what weve done with the place
beech moves on
jack and julia follow cautiously
they pass into a giant area devoted to agriculture
rows of wide two story glass tubes hold plants bearing fruit
their roots are held bare bathed only in moist air
we grow what we can under the lights
it isnt much wheat grass some vegetables what beans and soy we can
the general state of our health proves that human beings are not herbivores but the alternative is not appetizing to anybody
not yet anyway
when we get you up to the tet theres plenty there is
plenty of what
look itsamazing youve lasted thislong
but the radiation zonesare growing
all of this willbe gone soon
the area you dont patrol
no one does
you go there your organs boil from the inside
beech moves on turning down another corridor
there are paintings stacked against the walls
picasso monet kandinsky warhol
sculptures in piles
a grand piano is pushed in a corner other instruments propped against it
they pass a room filled with books another with a screen mounted in front of a projector
for a moment jack forgets everything else
its like his private collection at crater lake but a hundred times bigger richer
julia stops in front of a painting of a young girl in a field of golden grass staring towards a farmhouse on the horizon
she turns to jack
it reminds me of home
victoria is communicating with the tet
she has been crying sick with worry
my technical officer jack harper
time since last contact
protocol states hours before reporting a loss of contact
the scavs took him
i witnessed it
he has a
victoria experiencing jealousy she didnt fully understand before
theres a woman with him
the survivor of the crashed shuttle julia sommerville
prep the survivor for immediate evac
i told you shes with the technical officer
im requesting permission to re task the drones for search and rescue
victoria gets to work on the console re tasking drones
another tone makes her look over
you doing okay vika
yes i mean
i dont know
tet comm status communication ended
jack and julia are held back by scavs as up ahead beechs second in command the battle hardened sykes whispers heatedly in his ear glancing back
not everyone thinks having jack and julia here is a good idea
jack peers over the edge of the gantry they are on
far below ancient geothermal turbines churn
jack what he said about the tet
not looking at her it took three decades to build the tet
and when it was finally ready and it was time to go up there were people who refused
leaders who told their people to stay
staring at beech the glint in the mans eyes
and so they stayed
and they were slaughtered
whatever the conversation is it doesnt go well
sykes storms off angry
other scavs go with him
the rover has reached the canyon starts to make its way in towards raven rock
vika is on a tear working hard
unable to reach jack shes looking for any clue anything to help find him
to that end shes replaying the recordings of her last transmission from the bubbleship
we hear her last jack
theres something coming your way
victoria listens chilled
she hits rewind then play itll be fine
im trying to
ill be home for breakfast
alone in the sky tower this hits victoria hard
victoria stares at the counter letting it go further back
then we hear victorias end of a conversation we already witnessed im near the
still more than five clicks from the
what are you doing out there so far jack
then the static for a moment filled with garbled sounds
victoria hits stop
makes an adjustment plays the sounds again
something drawing her in
a large bay filled with machinery computers
other things scavenged from the wreck of the odyssey including several delta sleep pods
scav soldiers work in the center of the bay on a downed drone
its been opened up taken apart
all of its circuit boards and wiring spread out hooked to computers
to the side other soldiers are grouped around something
jack tracks the object theyre working on the scarred steel cylinder jack saw on the odyssey
its been opened up and some ten scavenged deuterium fuel cells have been fitted inside the casing
she realizes something wheels on beech angry
you brought down the odyssey
you sonofabitch you crashed our ship
there were people on board all so you could get i know what i did
but tell us commander why did you have a bomb on board what was it for
she looks at jack reluctant to say it but
is an alien ship jack
the odysseys mission our mission was to investigate it
jack shakes his head no
it attacked us
first it destroyed our moon
then it unleashed its primary weapon a brilliant weapon
i was born there
i was born in chicago jack
i used to go to baseball games with my father
i used to get two big hot dogs fill em up with relish and mustard
just go to town
me and my pops watching the sox
quick pressing you have any memories like that jack
no my father was a was what
he yell at your mom
ever go to a baseball game jack
i already told you right sorry
tell me how your mother smelled
my mother smelled like warm fruit
like oranges sitting in the sun
jack starts to speak
beech moves to one of the scavenged delta sleep pods runs his hand over the embossed name plate
if you had looked more carefully at the wreckage of the odyssey you would have noticed there were two empty sleep pods
the pilot and the co pilot
jack stares at the name plate on the pod j
it was you jack
you and victoria
we were all on the odyssey
we were supposed to make contact
the tet is an alien vessel commander jack harper
it came and destroyed our moon and most of humanity when it did
and ever since with your help its been trying to finish the job
im sorry jack
its not good news i know
youve been turned to the wrong side
beech goes to the bomb stares down at it but now with your help we can finally destroy it
this is insane
he turns to julia but she wont help him
to both of them there are people up there what
people like you
we are the last real people
pockets like this one hiding out dying
probably all over the planet
beech raises his gaze to jack
we didnt win the war jack
these words hit jack
he starts to reply finds he cant
beech approaches fatherly gentle
it has taken us ten years to get here but we finally have a weapon and a working drone to carry it
except we cant successfully program the drone
its not our technology
but you can repairman
that is the beautiful irony
it gave you the skills
the rover crawls up the canyon finally arrive at the entrance to raven rock
it stops scanning the face of raven rock
a shot hits it it tumbles back utterly destroyed
victoria is working hard intent on deciphering the sound
she doesnt notice the image of raven rock appear on a side monitor transmitted from the rover
suddenly sykes and several other scavs burst into the area
all eyes go to jack and julia as the ruined rover is brought in
it followed him here
i told you this was a mistake
all around the periphery reaction
this is a disaster
well well we may be out of time
set the drone to return to the tet upon reactivation
it needs to go right to the center no
it will kill it will kill that ugly stain on the sky
now program the drone
soldiers push jack towards the opened drone
jack stares at the read outs the electronics
sykes grabs a weapon from a female scav soldier lines it on jack
i wont do it
he wont help us
we bury them both make our run as soon as we can load up
jack stares sykes down
you know i stare into weapons every day so you can put that away
because heres what i can tell you
back to beech if the rover found us the drones will too
unless you want them to find you let me get somewhere where i can send a signal
somewhere far from here
whats your plan jack
tell the tet where we are so they can send a nice big welcome the drones would kill you
let me try to stop that
you cant trust him
staying on beech youre wasting time
on beech sykes
jack and julia stand near the entrance to raven rock
sykes appears with the white rectangular box tosses it down in the dirt at jacks feet
beech watches as jack unfolds his motorcycle
behind them other scavs are packing up readying an exodus
i can fix this
well youre the repairman
jack powers up the bike and gets on
he looks at julia who hesitates then she climbs on the back of the bike
ill get to the antenna send a signal with my location
the tet will call off the search
you should be safe for now
jack starts to go
what if i told you that i had been to your radiation zones
and what i found there
would change everything you think you know about the world
jack looks at him hearing this
then guns the bike
beech stares after them the rooster tail of jacks bike racing away across the ruined landscape
what makes you think hes any different from the others
beech stares at him a moment then back out
beech turns away
jack pilots the electric bike across staggering beautiful vistas
landscapes of the imagination
on the back of the bike julia takes in the incredible beauty around her
finally in the shadow of a jagged mountain the bike slows and stops
jack checks the charge its dead
they climb off and jack leaves the bike where it lies headed off on foot
shes staring into the distance where an old wreck of a resource gatherer lies shattered against a cliff face
the scavs brought it down ten years ago
this time i thought we were at war with the scavs
but it turns out we were just killing each other
he turns heads off on foot
after a moment she follows
jack and julia reach the top of a high cliff with what looks like a metal spire protruding upwards at its edge
we pass over them staring down a familiar foot waterfall
jack has returned to the top of the empire state this time approaching from above
together they climb down the craggy rock face
two tiny figures against a massive backdrop a mortal fall below
jack is the first to drop onto the cracked cement of the deck
he moves forward pulling the plastic and camouflage off the transmitter and repeater
he gets to work on the repeater
its old tech hard to make it talk to the bubbleship
julia stands a ways off
for a moment their gazes meet then he continues working
victoria is hard at work processing the sound that caught her attention
she has it playing through the whole sky tower the sounds are broken static like almost alien
strange and guttural
fingers fly over controls making adjustments
this time the sounds parse into words
a male and a female voice
almost apprehensive she pulls an electronic filter overlays it on the signal which suddenly drops into perfect clarit a recording of jack and victoria from a different patrol
and i want a dishwasher the kind that you can put i dont think theyll have those on mars honey
how about just you
all the time
when we get there
her face totally still
strangely frozen in the face of this sweet little exchange
and then a sob breaks from her lips
the kind you cant control
her fingers shaking badly she plays the recording puts it on a loop
the voices boom through the sky tower over and over
frightening that their simplicity contrasts so much with the effect they are having on victoria who moves into the main room white as a sheet
she looks up as
the bubbleship lifts off from its platform and sails into the sky
she watches it go then rushes back towards her station
jack stares at the esb antenna down at the repeater and the line of code he hopes hes transmitting
what will you do now
jack doesnt answer
he moves to the edge of the deck stares out unwilling to meet her eyes
that old man is smart
those fuel cells the way hes got them tied in with your device
he could blow the whole station
jack you cant turn them in
he glances at her shakes his head
what do you want from me
im just a repairman
this is bigger than me
jack moves off to a corner of the deck by the old telescope
she follows him steeling herself
you and i started the same year at
it wasnt really about space for me it was about
what could be out there
look stop okay
just but for you it was always the stars
you wanted to fly further and faster than any one else
i dont know who youre talking im talking about a man i knew who was fearless
a man who wouldnt bow out of a fight ever
you and that old man have this story
except i know who i am okay
i know who i am
no you dont
that thing brainwashed you it erased your he turns starts to lean on the old telescope draws back staring at the thing like it bit him
what do you remember
intercut the auto piloted bubbleship skims over the surface of downtown headed towards the empire state
jack is staring at the telescope agitated confused
why do i
what is it about this place
ten days before we got our go ahead you asked me to meet you here
eager to find out where the bubbleship is headed she punches up the live feed
julia comes close puts a hand out rests it on his chest
she moves closer to him searching his eyes
dont you remember what happened here
intercut the bubbleship now moving up the waterfall
victoria leaning forward watching the feeds
julia takes one of his hands places it around her waist
moves closer still
when i sleep
youre always there
she kisses him
a younger julia is staring out over glorious intact new york city
next to her a younger jack peers through the telescope
now he pulls away turns to her
there right there
take a look
she smiles puts her eye to the telescope
the tall billboard with the girl on it
i dont understand
younger jack nervously produces an engagement ring from his pocket
now pan to the right slowly
panning over as he directed to a billboard half covered by a large canvas
the words julia will you marry me
clear on the canvas
she gasps looks over
there he is holding the ring vroooommmm
the bubbleship rises into view directly in front of them
jack kissing julia tries to break away confused guilty
julia holds on
she reaches to her collar pulls free a necklace a familiar ring dangles from it
there are a few pages missing but its the same book
victoria stares at the screen the image of jack kissing julia then breaking away
shes strangely cold like theres simply nothing left to feel
jack pilots the ship a tense silence between he and julia
he checks a few readouts then hits the comm
vika its me
im coming in
dont report in to mission not until i get back
julia is pressed far back in her seat watching jack
victoria is still motionless
she hears jacks calls on the comm does nothing
im minutes out
a tone makes victoria look over
the tet checking in
mission requests status of survivor
go to hell
did not copy
have you located your partner
vika is silent
the tet waits for a response
it doesnt get one
finally are you still an effective team
a long painful silence
tears flow without sobs
tet comm status communication ended
pushes away from the console numb
as she leaves the room we stay on the console
which suddenly comes alive
readouts go active data history starts to play
the tet is accessing everything
visual and voice recordings blaze by
images everything the bubbleship has seen
we see the image of raven rock sent from the rover
victoria enters the sky tower staring at it as if it was all alien to her
as she moves through she unzips her jumpsuit steps out of it moves on
her shirt then bra land on the floor
she moves on
julia and jack step out of the bubbleship head towards the interior of the sky tower
the whole thing has been opened up
wind blows freely through papers magazines
vases have been blown over water spilled
there are petals rose petals swirling everywhere
jack comes out near the garden
its been ripped to shreds
what plants are left lie uprooted and broken
flowers strewn about
petals float off the side of the sky tower and down into the clouds
victoria stands near the far edge looking out
shes no longer in her jumpsuit
she wears a beautiful flowing dress which waves in the wind
her hair is free
theyre humans like us
the war has become some giant
the heartbreak in her face clear
i saw you
i saw you two
shaking her head stay away from me with the truth
i dont want the truth
i preferred oblivion
victoria looks up sees julia in the distance
you never really loved me did you jack
his silence is loud
she laughs tears flowing
broken for her vika she was my wife
she looks at the infinite sky the clouds and as the tet appears
he steps towards her and she backs towards the edge
i told them
the drones will be here
jack feels the sting of this betrayal but quickly accepts it
then come with me
she shakes no dont you see what it means
there are still people living on earth
surviving on earth
people like us
victoria hears that and laughs bitter
her laughter dies
she looks at him strangely calm beautiful in this moment
i think they made us
victoria steps backwards
jack lunges forward
petals are falling towards us from the skytower and then so is victoria
jack stares after victoria for one terrible beat then falls to his knees
not yet feeling in shock
julia approaches slowly
he turns at her so fast shes afraid and steps back but he blows right by her into jack enters victorias station
trespassing in a space that doesnt belong to him
his eyes play over the room a cup of coffee now cold
a jacket on the back of her chair
on a monitor a wavelength plays silently
the signal she descrambled
he looks at the tet communication device
we realize hes never spoken directly to the tet before
this is technician jack harper
the signal goes out
where is your control officer
prep the survivor for immediate evac
did you hear what i said
prep the survivor for immediate evac
you will be reassigned
i want to talk to somebody
itll be good to have you back
i want to hear your voice
tet comm status communication ended
he stares at this last transmission
then looks up to the big map
from all over the sector drones are closing on the sky tower
closing on him
jack comes back out heading towards the ship
julia puts out a hand to him
we have to go
jack and julia streak across the sky in the bubbleship
on the heads up display they can clearly see the radiation border marked red in front of them and the two drones closing behind them
where are we going
beech said to look in the radiation zones
i have to go there
and if hes just a crazy old man
jack looks at her
itd be a funny moment but its not
ive been wrong about everything else
he dives the ship towards the clouds below
drones shoot down a canyon towards raven rock
the bubbleship bursts through clouds
up ahead the familiar ridgeline is approaching
jack hauls the ship over as the drones bear down on them opening up
we recognize one drone
canon fire rocks the bubbleship pieces blowing off
jack revolves the canopy to return fire
a drone explodes but drone and another blast through the smoke firing
everything has been packed loaded ready to leave
beech watches sykes supervise the final lashing of the bomb onto a sled
beech gives a command and the great steel door groans open revealing
six drones waiting
their weapons powering up
on beech a final realization washing over him
jack spins the ship evading pursuit even as he checks his heads up tracks the two sky tower drones closing from behind
he hauls over pursuing drones turning with him firing as the two drones burst out of cloud cover fast mid air collision two more drones go down
jack hits the brakes
another drone overshoots him pulls up
jack sites the drone starts to fire
the bubbleship is raked with fire
drone is right on them and firing
the canopy is hit
cracks spider web across it
a canon is blown clean off
jack tries his remaining weapon
it pulls out of an arc accelerates closing on the bubbleship as the bubbleship tears away into a cloud bank goes in
drone follows seconds behind
drone emerges from the cloud bank into open air its cannon lining on
it revolves quickly sensing for
jacks bubbleship impacts the drone from above the ships manacles designed for transporting broken drones clamping on
suddenly the two vessels are locked
and the drone goes wild
its engines thrusting fighting against the counter force of the bubbleships engines
the drones guns blasting in every direction but unable to elevate to hit the bubbleship
inside the bubbleship
julia screams as the ship tumbles end over end
jack stays on the controls tracking the last drone closing from above
jack forces drone and ship to turn turning drone s canon on the last drone which explodes
he punches the throttle
the bubbleship with drone attached blasts in the direction of a cliff face
drone gets free of one restraint rotates so its cannon come to bear on part of the undercarriage
opens up blasting the storage to bits
and jack pulls up just clearing the ridge drone impacting rock
the drone blasts clear through crashes jack and julia in the damaged smoking now shaking ship
jack nods turns the ship north again
the bubbleship shaking and smoking
up ahead the ridgeline approaching
warning alarms trigger on the bubbleships display claxon like
what is that
were five clicks from the border
jack makes an adjustment the bubbleship surges with more speed
it sounds like its going to tear itself apart
the smashed drone powers back up
a moment as it runs its systems then blasts off in pursuit
on the heads up they can see drone coming up behind them closing fast
jack touches a familiar button
the bar guage for his extra boost starts to fill
from behind them blasts go wide
drone is firing missing
the bar gauge falters something broken
jack slams the dash
gauge keeps rising
the bubbleship starts to buck as red warning text streams across the canopy lethal jack
i got this
jack hits it
theyre both propelled back into their seats
the radiation zone coming up fast
they cross and the bubbleship goes completely dead
jack works controls punches at the display
but theres nothing
just the whistling sound of wind
what are you doing bob
bob just bobbles
the blasts from drone impact them helpless
jack grabs a level a mechanical lever and hauls it up
the cockpit of the ship separates from the body
the dead body of the ship tumbles backwards as drone blasts it tries to pull up but the bubbleship impacts drone which spins out of control towards the ground
the bubbleship cockpit skims the surface impacts a ridge blasting through it
it hits another ridge the canopy shattering earth piling in on them as they finally grid to a stop
jack groans leans to checks that julia is okay
shes coughing dazed but alive
jack opens the canopy door
it falls off
he stumbles out himself still dazed
wind and sand blow around him
close on jack
he breathes in
waiting for a painful death that doesnt arrive
son of a bitch old man
words die on his lips as he tracks the plume of smoke from the downed drone lifting over a nearby ridge
he turns back to the ruined ship grabs his carbine
jack runs towards the smoke which is already being blown clear by a rising sand storm
he flops down in the dirt at the top of the rise bringing his weapon up
jacks pov drone
it lies smashed and smoking at the bottom of an incline
the wind and sand are beginning to whistle now growing intensity
jack starts to stand
when a familiar sound makes him turn
jack hits the dirt as a bubbleship just like jacks screams overhead and lands next to the drone in a moment eerily reminiscent of the first scene of the film
below a man gets out of the second bubbleship
he wears the same kind of suit as jack
another repair man
hes got a bandana wrapped around his lower face to shield him from the sandstorm
jack reaches for his binocs bring them to his face only to find the lenses shattered
reaching the downed drone the man kneels next to it and in a familiar fashion begins utilizing his tools to fix drone
he locks a damaged cannon back into place tightens it
jack suddenly realizes what the mans doing
he stands the wind now blasting in his direction he starts running down the hill towards the man
dont touch that drone
his words are eaten up by the wind and sand
he rushes forward
with the repairman
we only see his hands as he works on drone
hes very good
even in the growing sandstorm he clips out a ruined board slots a new one in
runs a by pass around a wire bundle
the repairmans fingers go to a familiar switch to activate the drone
the repairman hears the voice even as he flips the switch
he leaps back spinning around his carbine coming off his back lined on jack fifteen feet away who jacks pov the repairman
holding the weapon on him
the man is jack
a cleaner newer but identical version of jack
jack stares transfixed
now it all makes sense the garbled transmissions victorias last words who or what he really is and is not
not so for jack
he takes a step back confused horrified
a tense moment
julia has just crested the rise sees the two jacks
jack senses her movement spins and aims his rifle as jack rushes forward no
he hits jack and they both go down the weapon firing
they fight over the weapon
blow for blow combat their physical strength and training identical the only exception being that jack is fresh his suit immaculate a man who has just arrived at work maybe
just arrived on the planet
standing watching the two clones fight
she suddenly drops to her knees her hand on her side
blood seeps between her fingers
shes been shot badly
with jack and jack
jack grapples with jack trying to control him
you have to understand
you have to understand
jack throws jack leaps on top of him trying to throttle him in a full panic
jack drives up into his gut rolls away
were just drones
were just drones man
you and me
dont you get it
dont you know
jack comes at jack wildly emotion over amping technique
jack ducks the blow wraps jack up in a choke hold
its going to be okay
jack goes limp unconscious
jack lets him go staggers back
everything finally processing
he turns towards julia sees her kneeling there holding her side
the blood seeping between her fingers
jack runs to her as she begins to fall
she is conscious but just barely
but still she pulls back from him
dont touch me
dont she lurches away from him body running on fear and adrenaline
jack nods accepting her terror of him
he moves forward lifts her up against her willand carries her to shelter among the rocky terrain closeby
jack sets her down
theres blood frosting her lips and her skin has gone pale
he looks back sees the bubbleship and jack s form lying next to it
he realizes something
ill be back for you
jack climbs in looks around at the interior of the ship at the similarities
he stares out at the unconscious jack in front of the ship
one two three
then lights sparkle across the board
lets go home
the bubbleship lifts off
making the approach
and then he sees it another sky tower just like his
it had to be there
the bubbleship closes on this new sky tower
a woman we know but do not know is starting her new garden
she looks happier a little younger and more radiant than the victoria we knew
its earlier in their tour
victoria looks up as the bubbleship lands
smiles as jack gets out and crosses the bridge towards her
as he approaches she notices his damaged environmental suit
what happened out there
i lost contact
jack stares at her heartbroken
just a bit of a dust up
are you all right
she comes over to him
he marvels at her beauty the simplicity of life here
she comes close brushes his hair away from his forehead
you dreamed a lot last night
i was thinking you have to start writing them down
i cut myself i just came by for
ill get it
no ill get it
he kisses her
ill get it
you stay here
and as jack goes into the sky tower she returns to happily planting her roses
as jack heads through his work area he sees a collection
just started but not much different from his own
some coins a book the collected poems of t
elliot left open to a page a passage underlined
he reads we shall not ceasefromexploration and the end of allourexploring will be to arrivewherewe first started and know the placeforthe first time
he nods strangely moved moves on
he grabs the healant and wand
he shuts the cabinet stares at his reflection in the burnished steel
he opens the door to the locker
stares at the brand new unworn picture of he and victoria taped to the inside of the door
jack comes out into the living area of sky tower noticing everything the furniture the big things are exactly the same but the little personal touches the smaller details are
he sees it all in a different light now
things that he never looked twice at before
the items used to keep them from the truth
victoria comes in from outside washes her hands
we should watch a movie tonight
he sits looking around himself
he belongs here
he fits here
victoria munches on something
i was going over the catalog and theres still a bunch of your favorites i havent seen
she glances over smiles
who wouldnt forget everything for that smile
jack stares down as the bubbleship lifts off from sky tower
he sees victoria come out looking at him puzzled
then she moves towards her control station
after a moment her voice comes over the comm
hey you didnt say goodbye
he turns the bubbleship towards jack touches down in the second bubbleship
drone still lies there but jack is gone
jack clambers into the enclave to where he left julia
shes passed out she looks dead
theres blood on the ground around her
he pulls her into his lap pulling away the clothing around the wound
as he does her eyes flutter open
shes delirious eyes fixing on him
this is gonna pinch a little
he spreads the healant over her wound activates it
for a moment nothing
then the skin starts to knit
and julia starts to scream
julia is unconscious propped in the passenger seat of the ship
jack climbs in jams bob the bobblehead onto the dash
it bobbles at him ready
jack hits the gas and the bubbleship lifts into the air
the bubbleship soars through the sky
theres something particularly calm picturesque exquisitely beautiful about the earth below
in the seat next to him julia is pale propped against the canopy recovering
she watches him
hes aware of her gaze but he doesnt look over
julia weakly stands amidst the tarped supplies aware shes trespassing somewhere utterly private
outside the sound of jack splitting wood
she takes in the books the records the mementos of the past
sees the jammer up and working
jack comes in gets to work piling wood in the fireplace
he wont meet her eyes
scared of himself ashamed in front of her
i always thought that plateau up there could be for a house someday
i thought about remaining here letting the rest of humanity run off to mars
and wed just stay here
jack stops himself realizing how easily he said we
he moves away from her lights the fire it starts to crackle
he gets up and goes walking down to the lake
she stands near the fire glad for its warmth watching him out there silhouetted in front of the lake
he stares out over the water
letting the truth wash over him
and then music from the grotto
the opening bars to the temptations my girl
julia stands by the record player watching the disc revolve
she looks up when jacks form appears in the doorway
hes been out there too long cold
he loved this song
jack sits shivering looking out at the lake
she moves to him wraps a blanket around him
what was he like
he was arrogant and annoying and the best man id ever known
some distant part of jack smiles at that
and i loved him
im not that man
yes you are
she rests her head against on his shoulder holds him
a group of astronauts and nasa controllers are celebrating
a television screen reads odyssey mission a go
a younger jack and julia are among the people celebrating
as an astronaut pops champagne jack and julia find a private alcove he lifts out the engagement ring that she wears on the necklace around her neck
we should just tell everybody
no when we come home
their bodies entwined
clothing pulled away
staring into each others eyes
younger jack stares out the window at the odyssey on its launchpad in the distance
steam rolls off its engines
its being readied to launch
he looks over smiles
shes naked under the sheets happy smiling back at him
jacks eyes blink open
julia is asleep near him peaceful
he turns stares into the lightening morning sky
the tet rising with the sun
jack walks to the waters edge
he stares at the reflection of the tet in the glassy surface of the lake
and under that a fish nibbling algae
he smiles at the fish
shes there arms held around herself against the chill of morning
they look at each other so much to be said
we cant stay here
she smiles nods
jack and julia fly low over terrain
as the bubbleship crests a rise and drops down into a steep canyon she takes his hand
he glances at her lets his hand stay in hers
the entrance to raven rock looms ahead
his eyes narrow
theres smoke drifting from inside raven rock
as the bubbleship touches down the carnage becomes clear
a few shattered drones lie here and there but there are bodies and smoking blast points everywhere
jack grabs his carbine heading inside
as jack moves into the darkness of the ruined raven rock his suits lights blaze on
he moves in weapon ready
bodies are everywhere blasted to pieces
fires still burn here and there
paint bubbles on burning canvas
records melt and drip in the heat
jack turns a corner finds sykes staring at him
but his eyes are dead
sykes still holds a spear implanted in a drones wrecked body
a flickering light draws jacks attention
beech is slumped in a chair blastburnt clutching a charred black box in his arms
his eyes half lidded he newsreel footage from when the tet arrived
on the screen crowds stare the un meets cults form
the moon in the sky its surface vibrates then starts to come apart
cutting to war footage
alien troop ships touching down their design distinctly tet like
they discharge waves of warriors
close on hand held war journalism
we see the alien soldiers pushing back resistance
all of them are versions of jack
one sights the cameraman blam
blows him away
camera hits dirt
jack is there next to beech
hes just pushed the projector over
not looking up the first ones were soldiers programmed only to kill
beech slowly painfully looks at him
little emotion in beech just resigned recognition
later there were new versions
the tet needed something different
and finally there was
im the weapon of this war
beech smiles sardonic nods
the clockmaker god
such brilliant complex machinery
for such a simple task
to steal our water our life
all for fuel
it doesnt even care about us
why didnt you tell me
not the kind of news that
coughing up blood motivates a man
beat then low defeated
we lost jack
shaking his head no drone
it will go on devouring world after world
you like books jack
beech closes his eyes recalling from memory
cowards die many times before their deaths the valient never taste of death but once
beechs voice trails off
jack kneels in front of beech
the old mans eyes are open fixed on the artwork the remnants of humanity
but they dont blink any longer
beech is dead
jack reaches up closes beechs eyes
he removes the box from beechs arms the flight recorder from the odyssey
there is a way
julia stands in the doorway to the library
it wants me
bring me to it
off his silence im right
you know i am
its the only way
the room destroyed
the disassembled drone a smoking hulk
jack works in front of an open delta sleep pod from the odyssey
he hauls the cylindrical bomb to the pod slots it into the space for personal effects
is it ready
julia is standing at the entrance to the room
he nods and she approaches stares at what will be her coffin
lets just do it
she moves to climb in then turns to jack and kisses him
its a kiss filled with a lifetime of kisses missed
finally it breaks
she backs away into the pod next to the bomb
trembling as the door starts to close
suddenly shes very scared
fighting back panic
the door closes seals
jack stares down at her through the carapace
he puts a hand on the glass
she puts hers on the other side
i got this
he touches a button and a pale gas starts to fill the chamber
julia realizes that this will be her last moment of consciousness
trembling crying afraid
and she falls asleep
jack stares at her sleeping form
dream about us
wind tearing at him jack loads the sleep pod onto the drone carrier of the bubbleship
the bubbleship hovers high above the clouds the delta pod attached beneath it
jack stares down at the earth
he hits a control and the ship rotates so its facing upwards towards the tet which fills the sky above
jack touches the throttle and the bubbleship begins to climb
jack has the odyssey flight recorder on the seat next to him
he touches a control and the audio fills the canopy
its distant fuzzy recorded from deep space
jack listens as the tet grows in size in front of him
good morning folks this is captain jack harper here in the cockpit
were settling in at a cool one hundred and fifty clicks from the unidentified flying object
the original jack in the pilots seat original victoria next to him co piloting
jack grins as he peers out at the tet just a small geometry among the stars
to mission control so far from this distance were still reading zero heat signatures no sign of organic life
did i mention were still really far away
mission plan has us approaching to one hundred kilometers doing our initial readouts
yes because everyone knows if you want to really know something one hundred kilometers is the best stop
we dont know what it is if it has intentions
to mission control i think she just made my point jack touches a control the sound from the recorder fast forwards
hours and hours of time on the odyssey fly by
the bubbleship has reached the stratosphere where the blue sky gives way to black space
we see the small ship detach from the blue curve of earth the blackness of space in front of it
bob lets prep for outer atmosphere
outside the bubbleship starts to transform for outer space as it rises higher and higher
a metallic voice technician harper
there you are
your ship has converted to space mode
this is not authorized
i am delivering the survivor from the crash of the nasa ship
the tet reflected in his eyes
a more effective team
the tiny bubbleship climbs towards the massive artificial moon as the audio from the flight recorder surrounds him again
we dont know if were dealing with e
or the klingons here and were not going to from this distance
the original jack and original victoria in a friendly argument
it could be inert
anything on it could be long gone by now
which is why we need to make contact before it just blows on by like some
which is why we need to make contact
he double takes relieved that she finally agrees with him smiles
to mission control i agree with commander harper
it crossed whatever light years of space and time to come this close to us
were not going to really know anything about it from this far away
jack sits in the bubbleship the tet looming above the voices surrounding him
they must have been given clearance to approach because the tet now fills the view in front of them
mission control says maintain one thousand meters
original jack touches a control
the shuttle pushes forward a little
what are you doing
this is a once in a lifetime opportunity
we have our orders jack
were to let it proceed without we are
were going to let it proceed whereever its going
he lifts out of his seat floats back towards the mid section of the shuttle
hes already pulling on a spacesuit
near him is the row of delta sleep pods
in the nearest one he can see julia asleep
he puts his hand on the glass
ill be right back
are we really going to do this
he looks over
original victoria is already pulling on her spacesuit
a last glance back at julia then he turns away
he smiles at victoria drifts next to her pulling out a small camera and pointing it back at the two of them
lets make history
the birth of the picture of the two of them eyes filled with anticipation
the photo in jacks locker
the shuttle airlock cracks
two figures in space suits emerge
small puffs of gas they head towards
the tet massive in front of them
their small forms shrinking at they approach it
close on jack
his face seen through his visor as they approach
filled with wonder
the dark shadow of the tet crossing over him blacking out everything
our jack sits at the controls the tet now similarly massive in front of him blotting out all other sight
he glances at the bobblehead which trembles from the ships engines
its okay bob im scared too
in front of him a slot opens in the tet wall
enter at headway speed only
entering at headway speed
he flies into the tet carrying the pod
the tet is obviously of alien manufacture
in this huge bay other bubbleships are being constructed welded together by drones
jack drifts above all of this
leave the survivor and return to your duties
breathable atmosphere has been provided
a pad is illuminated for jack to land
jack continues on towards a huge door
leave the survivor and return to your duties
touching a control you know you made a mistake tet
you left me curious
leave the and right now i want to see what youre made of
jack guns his ship at the large doors opening up with canons as he does
in front of him the door implodes just as jacks ship reaches it passing into
a vast space miles in every direction
jacks ships streaks along walls that pulse with energy
do you like books tet
i like books
can i tell you something that i read
behind the bubbleship
drones detach from the walls of the tet beginning pursuit
its a story from rome a very great city that you destroyed
the bubbleship hauls over headed deeper into the tet
drone sits inert in the sand where we last saw it
now it rises up with a familiar and evil sound
it moves off searching
jacks flies as never before
drone fire reaching him
blasts impact the bubbleship
there was a guy named horatius
and he held a bridge alone
and when they told him to run to give up he said boom
a drone blast explodes a whole engine of the ship
the bubbleship goes into an uncontrollable spin headed straight at a wall
he said everybody dies
the thing is to die well
jacks ship impacts the wall goes halfway through
the canopy shatters
glass and debris tear at him
jack stumbles out badly wounded
he drags the pod off the carrier
he looks around himself sees
row upon row of empty glass pods
he tracks the walls until near him
there are a dozen with jack and victoria clones still inside
behind him drones blast away from behind the bubbleship
jack stares at the clones laughs morbidly
what horatius said what his argument was was this
he opens the pod revealing
beechs body and on his chest the raw bomb
the nuclear warhead from the odyssey surrounded by ten deuterium fuel cells
that is not the survivor
the drones blast away the last bit of the bubbleship push through
a delta sleep pod rests in front of jacks ruined grotto near the lakes edge
a timer now reaches zero
the delta pod unseals with a hisss its door opening
soft daylight falls on julias face
her eyes move under their lids then flicker open
jack sees the drones swarming towards him
he starts to recite but falters
hes really scared
how can a man die
julia emerges from the pod confused looking around
she sees the metal cylinder releases it and it tumbles to the ground
she crouches by it opens it
whatever she sees moves her to tears as in front of her the form of drone rises into view
its weapons trained on her
she looks up right at it resigned
as the drones swarm down jack closes his eyes recites without embellishment
the way these words were meant to how can man die better than facing fearful odds for the ashes of his fathers and the temples of his gods
the drones are on him weapons lining
do you hear me
jack pounds the trigger with his fist
as all the clones open their eyes
and everything is bathed in white light
the tet explodes in a massive deuterium fission explosion the entire artificial moon killed from within
falls inert in front of julia as the tet explodes in the sky above her
she stares up tears already running down her face
drones fall from the sky powerless
a resource gatherer yaws losing power and falls ponderously into what remains of the sea
the explosion is like st elmos fire refracted across the sky all over the face of the earth
julia looks down at her hands which hold a rolled canvas the only object inside the metal cylinder
she unrolls it now
we glimpse a girl lying in golden fields a farmhouse in the distance
the painting from ravens rock that reminded her of home
on julia weeping staring at the fire ball in the sky
thick ripe fruit hang on vines
the tet arrived almost half a century ago
and it changed our world forever
were at crater lake three years in the future
the grotto has been turned into a house the ground has been cultivated
roses and yellow flowers grow near the house
a solar array powers the spot
all jacks scavenging has gone to very good use
theres a small make shift boat moored at the lakes edge
it was probably surprised what we were willing to do to survive
jacks basketball sits alone near the hoop
we had to unlearn what it meant to call something our home
theres a familiar painting hanging on the wall
the girl in the field of wheat yearning towards home
but we did
we started over
and so here we are now everyone thats left
julia is turning over a patch of ground for next year
next to her a child is digging her fingers through loam
the child looks up stares across the water
well almost everyone
a man stands at the edge of the water on the opposite side
he wears the wrecked remains of a worksuit and carries a pack
it is jack
hes aged three years his hair has grown his boots are scavenged
he has travelled a long way and we know that as he stares across the water he knows exactly what he is looking at
who is that
its been a long journey to this moment for her as well
its your father
come on lets go pick him up
