href b b air force one andrew marlow eighteen combat ready special forces wearing assault black jump packs and combat gear stare down the deep end of a greasy ramp
into the night sky
village lights flicker feet below
the strike force leader signals to his team
without a moments hesitation they dive into the darkness and plummet toward earth
a military guard old soviet style uniform rounds the corner of the large estate toting an ak
a red laser dot appears briefly on his forehead and after a beat the red dot seems to bleed
the guard collapses dead
two other guards are dispatched with single silenced shots
a strike team member at a junction box awaits a signal
through infra red binoculars the strike force leader watches his assault troops as they take positions
into headset in russian on the estate as the power goes out
the team on the mansions front porch pops the door and pours in
following the five team members as they rush a stairway in phalanx formation
they nearly knock over an old lady who in turn lets out a blood curdling scream
the team kicks open a door
rushes into the room
assault weapons pointed at the bed
the soldiers yank back bedsheets to reveal ivan stravanavitch a middle aged man and his half naked year old concubine
in russian get up now
the soldiers pull stravanavitch to his feet and haul him out of the room
following as they push down the hallway
mansion security guards rally with haphazard gunfire
out come the strike forces flash bang grenades
exploding everywhere disorienting stravanavitchs men
signal flares burn as a helicopter descends on the position
the strike team evacuates across the field and forces a struggling stravanavitch into the low hovering copter
the commandos swiftly board the craft as a handful of stravanavitchs guards break into the clearing
they open fire
and the mounted machine guns on the helicopter return
one of the strike team members takes a bullet to the neck
hes pulled by his comrades into the chopper as it lifts into the sky its guns spitting lead
archangel this is restitution
archangel this is restitution
the package is wrapped
we are standing by for delivery
the sounds of a dinner banquet
forks clanking against plates and the din of a hundred conversations broken by
the ding ding ding of a spoon tapping against a wine glass
hundreds of men and women in formal evening wear sit at round banquet tables
a hush falls over the guests as the dinging continues
all attention turns to the front table
a rotund silver haired man in his late sixties rises and sidles past u
and russian flags up to the podium microphone
he is stoli petrov president of russia
in russian thank you for joining us this evening
petrovs harsh russian issues through the room
but over it we hear a young womans voice translating
tonight we are honored to have with us a man of remarkable courage who despite strong international criticism
a translators words ring in the earpiece of a handsome man in his mid forties
worry lines crease his forehead and the touch of gray at his temples attest to three very difficult years in office
this man is james marshall and he is the president of the united states of america
he busily makes last minute changes to his speech
earpiece has chosen to join our fight against tyranny in forging a new world community
ladies and gentlemen i give you the president of the united states of america
thunderous applause as marshall rises and approaches the podium
at the back of the room doherty a senior policy adviser whispers to the presidents chief of staff ed shepherd
maybe we should consider running him for re election instead of the u
the applause dies as marshall begins to speak
in russian with subtitles good evening and thank you
first i would ask you to join me in a moment of silence for the victims of the turkmenistan massacres
the room remains silent a few beats
most guests respectfully bow their heads
marshall begins again but this time in english
the young woman translates simultaneously for the russian audience
as you know three weeks ago american special forces in cooperation with the russian republican army secured the arrest of turkmenistans self proclaimed dictator general ivan stravanavitch whose brutal sadistic
reign had given new meaning to the word horror
i am proud to say our operation was a success
applause from the audience
marshall turns the page on his speech
and now yesterdays biggest threat to world peace
today awaits trial for crimes against humanity
during the applause marshall pulls a page from the speech folds it and slides it into his pocket
he removes his glasses and looks out into the crowd
his tone becomes more personal
hes not reciting the speech anymore
what we did here was important
we finally pulled our heads out of the sand we finally stood up to the brutality and said weve had enough
every time we ignore these atrocities the rapes the death squads the genocides every time we negotiate with these these thugs to keep them out of gig country and away
from gig families every time we do this
we legitimize terror
terror is not a legitimate system of government
and to those who commit the atrocities i say we will no longer tolerate we will no longer negotiate and we will no longer be afraid
its your turn to be afraid
applause rolls through the crowd
sprawling terminals spread out to runways like tentacles
bathed in floodlights perched majestically on the runway dwarfing nearby commuter and military jets stands
the presidents own boeing dubbed the flying white house
the distinctive royal blue stripe over a thin gold line tapers to a tail adorned with the american flag and the presidential seal secret service agents and marines stand guard
at the aircrafts perimeter
a russian news van emerges from the darkness and pulls to a stop by a secret service barricade
special agent gibbs greets the russian news team that emerges
gentlemen welcome to air force one
please present your equipment to special agent walters for inspection
the news teams segment producer a crusty old russian named korshunov raises his big bushy eyebrows
weve already been inspected
sir this plane carries the president of the united states
though we wish to extend your press service every courtesy you will comply with our security measures to the letter
korshunov and the five members of his news crew present their video cameras sound equipment and supplies to special agent walters for inspection
secret service dogs sniff through the baggage
please place your thumbs on the id pad
korshunov puts his thumb on the id pad of a portable computer
the computer matches up his thumbprint with his dossier and photograph
cleared flashes on the computer screen
the president walking with his entourage
cbs said theyll give us four minutes
they thought the russian was a nice touch
i always wondered if my freshman russian class would come in handy
sir you threw out page two
goddamn right i did
i asked for a tough as nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit
whats the point in having a speech if i have to ad lib
it was a good ad lib sir
wrote it last night
the president exits the building and enters his limousine
walters hands the bags back to the russians
equipment checks out
a striking woman in her early thirties descends air force ones stairway
gentlemen this is maria mitchell
press relations for the presidential flight office
shell take you from here
so nice to finally meet you in person
the president and i were delighted that we could accommodate you
now if youre all cleared
gibbs nods you can follow me then
they ascend into the belly of air force one
ill be giving you a brief tour then during the flight two members of your crew will be allowed out of the press area at a time for filming
you will have exactly ten minutes with the president and twenty with the crew
winding its way down narrow cobblestone streets onto a major thoroughfare
the limousine is packed with advisers aides military staff including lt
perkins the keeper of the nuclear football handcuffed to his wrist
in the b
on the limos television set the larry king show indulges in its normal banter
marshall wearily rubs his temples as he stifles a yawn
you wanna knock of f
what did the speaker say
he and the nra dont like the wording
apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isnt as popular as we thought itd be
representative taylor is working on a compromise
put together a score sheet
ill make some calls
with all due respect sir maybe you should give them this one
your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail stravanavitch
i might still have a few chips left
we could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge
the second amendment typesll love that
this is a crime bill shep
killing a couple ducks wont get it through committee
besides shep i told you
i dont shoot babies and i dont kiss guns
other way around sir
realizing what he said right
christ im tired
do me a favor and keep me away from the press
marshalls watch alarm beeps and he automatically reaches into his breast pocket pulls out a medicine vial and downs two pills with a coffee chaser
on the t
and your reaction to the presidents trip to moscow
good or bad
shepherd turns up the volume
this is the part i wanted you to see
one of our boys died in marshalls little publicity stunt and for what
so we could claim victory over another countrys problems instead of our own
and now hes got the nerve to prance around moscow gloating while that poor boys family is left to bury him
if i were marshall id be ashamed of myself
there you have it
harsh words for the president from michael danforth the speaker of the house
marshall mutes the television
a quiet moment
we cant let him get away with that kind of language
dont take it
sir the speaker of the house attacked this administration on national television
you cant afford to leave that hanging
ignoring shepherd did we tape the duke game
its waiting on the plane
the ending was pretty
interrupting please dont tell me
just for once let me be surprised
maria mitchell escorts the russians down the planes length
as they pass the galley maria motions up a set of stairs
up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the mission communication center
the mcc as we call it can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth
were linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations
we could run the country or run a war from there if we had to
this is a remarkable aircraft
you dont know the half of it
did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation
we could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary
a dubious distinction no
i guess it depends on your perspective
they walk by several conference rooms running down the starboard side of the plane
and all these rooms here
conference rooms though some have other functions
the one up front doubles as an emergency medical center
past the conference rooms they walk by a small side room where secretaries work on computers generating documents
as you can see back heres more like a regular plane
security and secret service take this cabin
youll be in the rear with the press pool
the rear press cabin just ahead of the rear galley and bank of bathrooms
a handful of disgruntled reporters feign sleep
heres a press kit
ill let you guys get comfortable and once were airborne ill be able to schedule the interviews
mitchell exits forward
one of the reporters stirs and looks up at the news team
space is a premium back here
you fellas win some sort of fly with potus contest
what is potus
president of the united states
we won nothing
we are itar tass news service
listen this here
this is my row
youll have to sit over there
korshunov trades looks with his news team
the presidents motorcade pulls up in front of air force one
the president and his entourage ascend from the lower deck platform onto the main deck
daniel axelrod air force ones pilot snaps off a salute as he passes
welcome aboard mr

to no one in particular rose and alice back yet
the ballet ran late
their eta is seventeen minutes
marshall nods as he pulls off his bow tie and enters his stateroom
shepherd follows two steps behind
marshall halts shepherd with a gesture
shepherd nods and waits by the door
perkins takes a seat outside the presidents stateroom and opens the latest tom clancy thriller using the nuclear football as a lap desk
marshall collapses on the couch rubs his eyes then closes them
a moment of peace in a breakneck day
the knock at the door jars him
can i at least issue a press release objecting to the speakers choice of wording
president marshall picks up one of the many phones in his office
i said its not worth the fight
into phone steward please
well just say it was in bad taste
forget it shep
the kid gave his life for his country and the speakers a bastard for turning him into a sound bite
ill take the heat
you give me ulcers
thats my job
a steward enters the room
could you get me a heineken
get him one of the russian beers
the steward nods and disappears from the room
weve got those russian news guys on board and itll look good in the papers
marshall picks up a stack of policy reports
thumbs through them
ive been eating borscht and drinking vodka for days
isnt that enough
off paper new home starts are down
the steward arrives with the russian beer
marshall takes a swig
he swallows hard
marshall crosses to his sink and pours the beer out
he hands the bottle to the steward
fill this with heineken
the steward nods
i dont believe this
im playing politics with a bottle of beer
a goddamn bottle of beer
ive been in office too long
look on the bright side
if the polls dont change you wont have that problem sir
marshall picks up the phone again
put the duke game on in my room
three air force specialists man the elaborate communication system occupying much of the upper deck
top of the line computers communication systems video decks and satellite receivers
he slides in a videotape and channels the feed to the presidents stateroom
a monitor comes to life with a basketball game
to shepherd defense and state department in the conference room in one hour
i want to review the iraq situation
shepherd exits as marshall settles into his leather chair and dives into work
he punches a button on the speakerphone
get me the housing secretary
the marine guards snap to attention once again as the first ladys motorcade arrives
rose marshall a self assured woman with an aristocratic gleam alights from her limo
she takes a few steps then turns tapping her foot impatiently
cmon alice were minutes late
your fathers gonna have a fit
alice the presidents year old daughter straggles out of the car rolling her eyes
its not like he hasnt made us wait a few times
well you arent the president dear
yeah no duh
as the first ladys entourage enters
why dont you go say hi
again alice rolls her eyes
what is wrong with you tonight
rose pulls alice aside
you dont want to say hi to your father
im sure hes busy
dont you even want to ask
alice toes her foot into the carpet as she releases an exasperated sigh
she is in this moment the patron saint of know it all year old girls
alice waves toward the presidential suite
if i go over there to say hi to daddy president mikes going to tell me hes in a meeting and cant be disturbed
then when the plane starts to taxi hell come out and say hey are you guys back
did you enjoy the ballet
but hell be on his way to another meeting and wont wait for an answer
then youll get pissed at him and hell get pissed at you
its like you guys rehearse or something
with the weight of the entire world on her shoulders alice collapses into one of the many leather chairs
it seems to swallow her
jory a steward passes
hey joey how bout a cocoa double whip cream
mom just this once give it a rest
youre jet lagged
well talk about this back
back at the fishbowl
alice eyes the swirl of aides who are pretending to work nearby
but its obvious that theyre eavesdropping
alice smiles and waves at them dramatically
well talk at home
beat you know most girls arent as lucky as you
for most girls seeing the bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime
i know mom
sees the hurt in her moms eyes and softens it was great
rose nods smiling a half smile
after a thoughtful beat alice gets up and crosses to the presidential suite
she exchanges words with the aide standing outside the door and comes back covering her disappointment
hes in a meeting
he cant be disturbed
im sorry honey
no its okay
after all he is the president right
joey the steward hands her her cocoa with a wink and a smile
her eyes light up at the mound of whip cream on top
when i write my memoirs i think ill devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard air force one
your father never means to be so
beat but lotsa times i feel like its me versus the world
some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in bangladesh
i mean it doesnt take a genius to figure which is more important
some kids were teasing you
thats not really the point
a quiet pause then
youre right and ill tell you a secret
i know exactly how you feel
you said the same thing to newsweek
the plane jolts forward as it begins to taxi
and as if on cue marshall exits from his office and checks his watch
oooooh im good
hey you guys back already
thinks then remembers the ballet
theatrically it was the experience of a lifetime
how bout a hug for the old man
alice rises and hugs her father
a white house photographer snaps off a few shots for the papers
alice makes a face at them
a second later shepherd comes up the corridor breaking up the pair
theyre ready for you in the conference room
hey pumpkin youll tell me all about it later right
as marshall moves toward the conference room he bends and gives rose a quick peck on the cheek
it all reeks of formality
may i speak to you for a moment
cant it wait
rose shuts the door behind them
as she starts to speak marshall pulls her into a long passionate kiss
rose pulls away
i know spin control when i feel it
rose i dont have time for this
ive gotta go stop a war
for godsakes jim slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy
not even you can plug all the worlds leaks
dont you think its a sign youre pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on mtv news than in person
shes a big girl
how do you know she understands
you havent spent more than five minutes with her or me in weeks
and when have i had five minutes
when i wake up in the morning and im already three hours behind schedule
what do you want me to do rose tell the g to fuck off because im a family man
that wasnt fair
he takes her in his arms
you know what
i miss you
and i miss her
but thats the point jim
were right here
i wish it were that easy
he smiles at her its the same sweet smile that won her heart the same smile that got him elected
ill make it up to you i promise
i should trust that promise
because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut
this promise isnt subject to congressional approval
the tension breaks
how did your speech go
well they arent burning me in effigy
thats always a good sign
they kiss again this time for real
a knock on the door
shepherd opens the door
look on the bright side hon
shep here thinks ill be a one termer

she is scheduled
her school plays tuesday night
rose rolls her eyes
the first lady was making a joke shep

marshall heads for his meeting
axelrod and his co pilot lt
arthur ingrahams are at the wheel
united states air force one this is tower
its an honor to clear you for immediate take off on runway three
and thank you for the hospitality
axeirod eases up the throttle and the four ge f turbofan engines spring to life
a picture perfect take off as air force one slides through the moonlight and skates upward on a sheet of air
airborne in the midnight sky
aircraft engines drone
close on a coffee pot pouring piping joe into a mug emblazoned with ubiguitou presidential seal
the mug is placed on a tray with a half dozen other mugs and passed to a stew
he carries the tray down the corridor past passenger cabins
drowsiness has overtaken the plane
many of the passengers and aides are asleep
cnn plays on t
sets entertaining the few night owls and news junkies
in an unusually aggressive speech the president characterized the stravanavitch regime as thugs whose brutality will no longer be tolerated
meanwhile in turkmenistan stravanavitchs ouster has sent the country into turmoil
tens of thousands of refugees continue to huddle in u
safe havens as rival stravanavitch loyalists fight among themselves for control
but at least for the time being the ethnic cleansing has been stopped
toward the front of the plane the steward enters the conference room
as the steward closes the door behind him all background noise disappears
we are in a sound shielded room
even the engines drone cannot be heard
the lights in the room are dim as major caldwell a military advisor projects satellite photos of iraqi military bases onto a screen
the steward serves coffee as unobtrusively as he can while the meeting continues
our kh lls took this one at hours
what you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades
theyve gotta be joking
the iraqi ambassador is claiming its just an exercise
an exercise in futility
send the nimitz back in
the northern borders gotten a bit hairy
their migs are playing tag with our tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage
tell our boys to cool their jets
i dont need em creating policy for me
we follow the steward as he slips out of the conference room and back into the
with a few coffees left on his tray
one of them is scooped up by gibbs as he passes his nose is buried in a fax
gibbs leans in the cabin
hey walters you and johnson come here a second
reykjavik just sent the advance team report
special agents walters and johnson rise and follow gibbs into an adjoining office
gibbs closes the door behind the two agents
as walters and johnson take their seats gibbs withdraws his weapon and
shoots each of the agents in the back of the head
blood all over the desk
gibbs removes each of the agents weapons and slips them into his waistband
he waits a few beats takes a long sip of coffee then exits the office
as he passes through the cabin he takes a silent inventory
five other agents working sleeping on the phone
gibbs nods to korshunov
korshunov nods one of his men
nevsky removes one of his videotapes pops the front cover exposing the tape
across the face of the tape is a thin strip of a rubbery substance
nevsky pulls the strip up and out making a kind of fuse
he reaches for a pack of matches
courtesy matches sporting the seal of the president
nevsky nods and lights the fuse
gibbs tosses his two extra weapons to korshunovs men pivots the corner and begins firing at his colleagues
the secret service agents try to get at their weapons but gibbs has caught them completely off guard
several silenced central nervous system shots head and neck and the five agents slump back their red blood cascading down the creases of the fine corinthian leather chairs
nevsky tosses the cassette up the corridor
smoke pours out of it
bazylev and zedeck catch the guns gibbs tossed and hold them on the reporters
bazylev grabs the stunned reporters yanking them into the aisle
walk in front of us
a half dozen of them
behind the terrorists one of the bathroom doors swings open
a secret service agent emerges
sees whats happening
reaches for his gun
zedeck fells him with a well placed unsilenced gun shot
a sleeping secret service agent bolts upright
hears more he springs up and moves toward the gunshots his weapon drawn
screaming out and into his lapel mike bazylev and zedeck lay down a suppressing fire outside the door
korshunov nevsky and vlad follow gibbs into the secret service office
gibbs opens a locker and pulls out a stash of mp automatic assault rifles and bullet proof vests
korshunov raises his bushy eyebrows in delight
the secret service believes in being prepared for any eventuality
the secret service agent fights his way through the smoke to a wall panel
punches a red buttoned intercom
a red light on the security panel lights up
we have a code red i repeat code red
shots fired onboard
axelrod cabin flight deck code red acknowledged
into headset microphone warsaw tower this is air force one
axelrod toggles his headset to secure line
ranstein air base this is air force one heavy
we have a code red
shots fired onboard request priority redirect
hunched over a control terminal the air traffic controller tracks air force ones radar image
go wake the general
the watch officer springs into action picking up a phone
air force one heavy acknowledged
you are on our scope
please state fuel remaining and souls onboard
sixty seven souls onboard were okay with fuel
request secure military escort with emergency medical standing by
air force one heavy acknowledged
we are scrambling our fighters
the controller hits a red button on his console
sirens flare up and klaxons wail across the base
the controller looks down to his runways
in the light of the moon he sees a half dozen men rushing toward f eagles
call berlin tower
not a plane lands or takes off within two hundred miles
the once sleepy midnight control room cranks into full crisis mode
gunfire pops in the b
air force specialists try to get the word out
no sir interrupt her
this is this is air force one
we air force one with an have a code red
shots emergency call
have been fired
the conference room door bursts open and two secret service agents weapons drawn enter the room and run to marshall
the once quiet room floods with light
the sounds of a gunfight and a blanket of smoke sweeps into the cabin
whats going on
were under attack
wheres my family
were handling it sir
the agents lift marshall to his feet and practically carry him from the room leaving the other high ranking officials to scramble for themselves in a cacophony of shouts
the launch codes
whos protecting the football
perkins carrying the nuclear football ducks and weaves his way down the corridor into the fray
he takes a bullet to the shoulder which fells him
alice is nearly trampled by agents responding to the gunfire
one agent grabs her and shoves her into a bathroom
dont open the door
gunfire pops all around her
smoke automatic weapons fire
secret service agents battling the terrorists
aides diplomats crew and personnel caught in the crossfire
a spray of weapons fire overhead and everyone hits the floor
air force one heavy you are cleared for priority divert all runways are clear
warsaw tower has cleared local airspace
changing course heading to point five
dropping to twenty thousand feet
shots can be heard outside
ingrahams make sure that doors locked
ingrahams locks the cockpit door
air force one banks into a curve and descends through broken clouds
the sounds of gunfire have reached the the nose of the plane
rose peers out to see whats the matter
an armed secret service agent runs toward her
a spray of bullets mows him down
he collapses in the door frame
terrified rose tries to close the door but the dead agent is in the way
filled with smoke and gunfire
the agents rush the president behind a forward bulkhead
into mike we have boy scout traveling forward
theyre up here too
were going to the chute
marshall looks up the hallway toward his stateroom
calling out gibbs fires
hits one of the secret service agents in the shoulder
blood blossoms through his clothes but he winces it off
come on sir
the secret service agents whisk the president to the front stairwell
they pull up a floor panel revealing stairs descending toward the baggage deck
alice huddled atop the commode
alice opens the door and rushes
tripping and falling over joey the steward
his dead eyes swim in a pool of blood that was his face
alice screams scrambling to her feet
perkins manages to push himself to his feet and stumbles down the hall into the computer room
terrorist serge spots the nuclear football dangling from his wrist
hysterical secretaries feverishly dump classified documents into a shredder while perkins struggles to open the black leather briefcase handcuffed to his wrist
bullets tear up the doorknob lock arid serge kicks in the door
the fawn halls hit the floor as gunfire sprays overhead
but perkins swings around brandishing his sidearm
he opens fire on serge but the bullets smack harmlessly against the swat vest
serge returns fire ripping up perkins who collapses over the shredder and with his last bit of strength he dumps out the briefcase
papers containing nucle war strategies and missile launch codes slide into the hungry shredding machine
perkins manages a slight smile before he keels over dead his duty fulfilled
the shredded remains of the nuclear football rain over his head like tickertape at a heros parade
the pale moon catches shiny streaks of metal that descend through the broken clouds
the squadron of f eagles drops into formation around air force one
gun shots right outside the cockpit door
air force one this is squadron commander canton
you are now under escort
all airspace has been cleared
this is air force one heavy
im coming in full throttle
eta to ranstein eight minutes
weve got a war here sir
encased in a helmet mask and visor carlton watches the flashes of gunfire in the dark windows of the plane
delta force has been mobilized
beneath the main cabin the secret service agents run the president through the forward baggage compartment and the lower galley a large room with compartments storage freezers and food preperation
on the far side of the galley the agents fling open a hatchway and enter
a narrow gangway running between the lower galley and the rear baggage hold flanked on either side by the landing gear bays
they duck under wing supports until they come to a mesh grating
the uninjured agent lifts the grating revealing an escape get in
get in sir
a second later gunfire rips up the agents face
the new volley sends marshall under the cover of a wing strut
the second agent takes position and returns fire
he quells the incoming volley for a moment
what about my family
i have a family too sir
now get in the fucking pod
the firing begins again
marshall struggles with the decision
you have to do this
the pod on three
the agent shoves in a fresh clip
cutting him off two
the agent combat rolls into the open and fires
he advances down the gangway acting as a shield for the president shooting blindly
marshall watches as hes hit repeatedly but it gives him the time he needs to dive for the pod
behind the bulkhead
when the agent drops nevsky and viad rush down the gangway
they arrive at the closed pod just as it begins to slide on its rails
they let loose dozens of rounds from their mp but the bullets just plink off
the pod lock doors slide shut
the president is on his way to safety
small bay doors open in the belly of air force one and a human sized cannister drops from the bottom its parachute opening instantly
a light flashes on the panel
into mike ramstein air force one emergency pod has been deployed
i repeat emergency pod has been deployed
this is ramstein
we are picking up the homing beacon and deploying search and rescue
we are dropping to five thousand feet beginning final approach
her voice comes closer filled with choking fear and panic
she rounds the corner and nevsky catches her hair with a vice tight grip shoving his mp into the small of her back
your father has left you behind
korshunov kicks open the door
gunfire from rose who holds the dead secret service agents weapon
she empties the clip at the doorway
no more bullets
korshunov steps into the room brandishing his automatic smiling
rose backs against the wall and raises her hands
a marine helicopte touches down on the greenway
marines salute and escort katherine chandler from the chopper interior to the south entrance of the white house
she is the vice president of the united states of america
zedeck steps over the three dead communications specialists on his way to the cockpit door
tries the door
he pounds on it
through the cockpit window the glowing landing lights of ramstein base are visible in the distance cutting a wedge through the german towns and fields
zedecks pounding continues
ramatein we are fifteen miles away on final approach
im coming in fast and will need every inch of runway
copy air force one
wind is twelve knots from the east
tactical and emergency are in position
rescue vehicle sirens gyre in the darkness
a team of black faced commandos unload from troop truck
snipers take position atop rescue vehicles barracks and the control tower
high powered rifles with infra red scopes
zedeck aims his mp at the flight door
fires off a dozen rounds
nickel sized indentations blossom across the steel surface
dull thuds of bullet impacts
lets get this crate on the ground
theyre some real good men waiting to help us
the plane sprouts landing gear as it descends over the city
coming in fast and low
gibbs shoves zedeck aside
produces a thumb sized amount of final approach
the landing strip not far at all
he raises his flaps
air speed and altitude drop
spotters find air force ones navigation lights visible in the sky descending from the distant darkness
followed by the cluster of f lss
gibbs rolls out the c like a kid making a snake in pottery class
he presses it along the door seal
the runway coming up to meet them
as the entire airbase collectively holds its breath
air force ones tires hover feet above the ground
gibbs raises his pistol
aims at the c
a blinding flash
the door blows in
the wheels touchdown
gibbs and zedeck storm the cockpit
axeirod gropes at the planes controls trying to retain the wheel
gibbs dispatches axeirod with one shot
zedek is a little messier with ingrahams
but both pilot and co pilot slump over their controls
the taxiing boeing suddenly veers to the right cutting across runways
emergency vehicles give chase
the plane bounces
is airborne for a second
touches down again with a jolt
terrorists lead hostages to the conference room
everyone is bounced around slamming against walls spilling over chairs
a master sergeant seizes the opportunity and grabs for bazylevs gun but bazylev shoots him almost point blank
gibbs tries to pull axelrod off the controls
zedek slams the throttle all the wa up
spotlights and sirens swirl outside the cockpit window
the flying white house careens toward the barracks then edges toward a hangar
the jet engines strain to reach full power
the controller stares down at the out of control plane
were losing it
gibbs pulls axeirods body out of the pilots seat
looks out the cockpit window and sees
in his path
a monstrous plane every bit as big as air force one
gibbs eases back on the wheel and the sluggishly responds its nose creeping upward
adjusts the flaps
air force one closes in on the starlifter
shes struggling off the ground like some injured bird
the straining metal defies gravity
gibbs senses that hes too close
he pulls way back on the stick risks stalling her out
but the bird responds
air force one barely clears the starlifter the edge of her wing just missing the top of the c s tail
the sharpshooters the emergency crews the commandos from delta force
nothing they can do but watch her rise out
gibbs and zedeck
gibbs checks over all the instruments
give me my heading
bearing point eight two
gibbs banks the plane into a curve then activates the auto pilot
call me if something changes
to fly a you need to know three things
how to take of f how to land and how to engage the autopilot
the terrorists from every corner of the plane lead the stunned survivors hands on heads to the central conference room
as korshunov walks rose up the corridor he meets up with gibbs descending from the upper deck
the rest of the secret service
how many others killed
any of us
gibbs touches his bulletproof vest
wheres my daughter
shes alive maam for the time being
rose allows herself a half sob of relief
and my husband
the secret service did their job maam
the president is safely off the plane
to korshunov but that still leaves us plenty to bargain with
eyes filled with hatred
rose slaps gibbs face
you of all people
gibbs doesnt react
follow me maam
high tech maps and communications systems line the walls surrounding an austere main conference table
laptop computers and secure telephones by every seat
tele type machines spitting out classified information
vice president chandler analyzes the projected course of air force one on the tactical vid map
we should have the president secure within minutes
do we know who these terrorists are or where theyre going
general northwood head of the joint chiefs of staff
general greely says it looks like the middle east
does your office have anything to add mr
national security advisor walter dean leans forward
the garners believe that given the scenario theres an chance that well be dealing with a hostage situation and not an assassination attempt
not much else until theres more data
if were dealing with an airborne hostage situation whats our procedure
the under secretary of defense thomas lee punches up a scenario on the lap top
our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground
our hands are completely tied while theyre in the air
okay gentlemen well take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane
lee go huddle with the d
i want an options paper on this in minutes
you heard me
points to an aide you
congress and cabinet heads
the aide nods and picks up a telephone
madame vice president
chandler turns toward the door
the colonel enters the room holding a black briefcase identical to perkins
national command authority
all previous launch codes have been cancelled
youre carrying the ball now
thank you colonel
have a seat
a huey flanked by a pair of apaches skims the surface of wheat fields at maximum velocity
the pilot checks his instruments
hes honing in on a signal
the swirling spotlights of the apaches finally illuminate the seal of the president atop the emergency deployment pod
the huey drops in for a landing and a half dozen army rangers in full combat gear deploy to the pod
they open it
bruised and battered some blood smeared across his tuxedo shirt
president james marshall lowers himself from one of the overhead wing struts
he emerges into the bowels of air force one
he stands quietly a moment listening
for footsteps for gunfire
all quiet except for the whine of the jet engines
he tak s a moment to think
considers his situation
his eyes find the dead agent who risked his life so he could make it to the pod
he trots down the gangway toward the lower galley
air force one hovers atop billowy peaks
the smaller f s cluster around her in a loose formation
sir isnt there something we can do besides escort
like what son
shoot our own plane down
i just wish
we all wish
now shut the fuck up and escort
marshall looks around for a weapon
half full coffee pot stove walk in freezer plates and silverware
marshall picks up a butcher knife
nevsky and bazylev guard the conference room door as korshunov and vlad enter
nevsky hands korshunov a copy of the planes manifest
every weapon and every person is accounted for
korshunov nods and enters the room
korshunov surveys the hostages
viad covers them at gunpoint
rose holds alice comforting her
shepherd doherty aides advisors crew
fifty of them huddle like sardines
the planes doctor administers to the wounded
korshunov stares down his captives
fear will keep you alive
any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish and bound to die
what do you want with us
if you try to escape you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrades bodies will prevent you from exiting
korshunov exits with viad backing out behind him
leaving the hostages alone
the sound of the door locking
a mournful beat
everyone looks at each other and the dead and wounded victims of this heinous act
hushed conversation breaks out all over the room
this cant be happening
you just dont pull this shit with the united states
you just dont
keep your heads
caldwell paces looks around the room
marshall are you okay
thats all that matters
thank god the president got of f the plane
to caldwell you there
whats on your mind
caldwell takes a beat then crosses to rose and shepherd
hushed i dont want to get anybody here excited but if we can get out of this room i can get us to safety
were thirty five thousand feet up
yes sir thats a problem but if we can somehow get to a lower altitude the rear loading ramp on the baggage deck is equipped with parachutes in case of
an engine failure
now we can either wait for a political resolution or try to resolve this thing ourselves
youre goddamn right we can resolve this ourselves
you know the presidents policy
the president isnt here
right now we are an enormous liability to the united states
we cant just sit and do nothing
the terrorists move toward the nose of the plane leaving nevsky to guard the conference room
president marshall reaches the front stairway
cautiously climbs to the main cabin
as he reaches the top stairs he hears russian conversation approaching
he ducks back into the stairwell
he cant see them but he can hear them
the terrorists pass within a few feet as they ascend to the mission communications center on the upper deck
marshall waits a few beats listens to the silence
then re mounts the stairs and almost runs into the back of
standing guard facing the opposite direction
looks past viad down the corridor where nevsky guards the main conference room floor
unaware of marshall viad reaches into his pocket and pulls out a cigarette
on the first puff he feels a presence behind him
vlad slowly turns around
he smiles at his jittery nerves turns back round
over vlads shoulder
marshall flattened behind the edge of the galley divider
he creeps away from vlad toward the presidential suite
stepping gingerly over dead secret service agents
korshunov pulls a handkerchef from his breast pocket and wipes the blood from a telephone headset
gibbs works the communications board dialing in a series of numbers
a map of air force ones flight trajectory is displayed on the rear screen
moscow to berlin and back toward the black sea
the assembled brass listens as korshunovs voice slithers off the speaker phone
the chief of staff the first lady and the first daughter
our demands are simple
arrange the release of ivan stravanvitch
once our leader is returned to turkuenistan soil air force one and its occupants will be allowed safe passage to switzerland
you have one hour before we start killing hostages
the phone clicks off
a silent beat in the room
find that voice for me i want to know who were dealing with
and get president petrov on the phone
general charles greely head of the th mechanized air wing the unit responsible for air force one enters the room
madame vice president we just got word from ramstein
the nod was until chandler stands
he must still be onboard
play back that call
the tech officer indexes back on his computer
the plane is under our command and those we did not kill we hold as hostages including the chief of staff the first lady and the first daughter
but not the president
not the president
a silent beat
hes dead then
they must have killed him
we dont know that
holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when youre making demands
and if hes dead
do you really think theyd risk telling us
there is a possibility were overlooking
all eyes turn to dean
when i ran specops in nam i ordered the destruction of a v
during insertion the plane was shot down and the entire team was killed or so we thought
two days later the dump year old kid the pilot
he walks out of the jungle in pretty bad shape
he survived the crash and finished the mission
walter if you have a point make it
that kids name was jim marshall
most of the presidents service record makes for dull reading because most of what he did iarlz ulirn
history remembers him for what he did aflar he got back to the states the protests the rallies but he was a soldier once a damn fine one
so what are you saying
maybe hes alive on that plane and those bastards dont even know it
dean may i remind you that the president is not anymore
marshall cautiously enters the room
ready for action
the room is empty but its been trashed by the firefight
the sound of voices
coming from the duke game which still plays
marshall hustles over to one of the secure phones
he tries the regular phone
hangs it up in disgust
he steps on some glass
its a broken frame holding a photograph of alice and rose
he picks up the photo and lays it on a table
he thinks for a beat
glances around the room searching
then he crosses to the closet opens it and begins rifling through his wardrobe
caldwell stands on the conference table
the hostages have removed one of the ceiling panels
air supply ducts and bundles of wiring run through the ten inch space between the ceiling and the shielding plates
this is a dead end
rose looks around the room
her eyes land on the carpet
marshall opens the stateroom door and slowly slides into the corridor
vlad still faces the opposite direction
marshall creeps down the hallway when
marshalls watch alarm goes off
marshall dives for the nearest doorway
vlad swings round to see a figure slip into the senior staff cabin
vlad unsure of what he saw
cautiously heads toward the staff cabin
as he nears he bends over a dead secret service agent and pulls up the lifeless wrist revealing abeening watch
it wasnt marshalls after all
vlad continues to the staff cabin
marshall frantically searches for something he can use as a weapon
in the room some video monitors leather chairs and phones
stainless steel cabinets run the length of one of the walls
marshall throws the cabinet doors open revealing
a fully stocked medical center
fold down operating table
high intensity lights
equipped to deal with any medical emergency the president might encounter
but too late
vlad kicks the door open
get on the floor now
marshall yanks down the operating table and it smashes into vlad knocking him down
marshall lunges with his knife but vlad opens fire
a half dozen rounds pump into marshalls belly
hes thrown back against the wall then slumps to the floor
vlad approaches the crumpled body
leans down to examine his victim
he cups his hand under the mans chin and lifts his head
wonderment the president
but marshalls eyes flash open
thats right asshole
he springs shoving the butcher knife under the flack jacket and into vlads spleen
vlad freezes unsure of what just happened
marshall is on his feet
never letting go of the twisting knife he grabs vlad by the back of the head and slams his face against the mirror above the surgical scrub sink
the mirror shatters and streams of blood erupt cn the terrorists face
the blood drips down into the white porcelain sink swirling into the drain
vlad elbows marshall in the neck stunning him momentarily
he wipes the blood from his face spins and hits marshall with a devastating right cross
marshall reels back against the wall and vlad follows shoving the mp into marshalls throat
marshall grabs the gun near the trigger
dont move or ill blow your head off
i dont think so
marshall presses the saftey button on the gun with his forefinger then knees vlad in the balls
viad pulls the trigger repeatedly as he goes down but nothing happens
instead he comes up swinging his gun butt against marshalls face
like a bat hitting a baseball it knocks marshall into the medical closet
the gun goes flying skittering marshall pulls himself up the shelves trying to keep his legs from buckling
vlad grabs some i
tubing and wraps it around marshalls neck
marshall struggles for breath clawing at the tube
pitched hum and beeping
marshall pulls his head forward straining against the plastic tubing
then slams back into vlads head
viad releases his grip just for a moment
the beeping becomes a steady whine
but a moment is all marshall needs as he grabs the def ibs cardiac paddles turns and slams them on either side of vlads head
vlad convulses from the shock for a full five seconds
his eyeballs roll his hair stands on end
then he collapses to the floor
marshall catches his breath for a moment
pulls open his shirt
beneath it he wears a bulletproof kevlar vest
he lifts the vest and a half dozen angry welts have blossomed across his skin
the stuff may be bulletproof but each of vlads shots sting like a motherfucker
nevsky walks down the corridor
sees that vlad is away from his post
marshall opens the medical cabinets rifling through them
pulls out hypodermics adrenalin rubbing alcohol
nevsky works his way up the corridor peeking in rooms
as he enters the
hes blinded by the high intensity surgical lights
marshall cracks a tank of anesthesia across nevskys heu nevsky goes down
marshall rips nevskys mp off of him
holds it to nevskys throat
where are th y
fly tamily the crew
where are they
nevsky says nothing
the conference room right
marshall jerks him to his feet
o unlocli the door for me or ill kill you
marshall walks flevsky toward the mj vonteronve room as they pass the stairs to the upper deck nevsky breaks away
no time for remorse
marshall tries the main conference room door
he knows the others will be coming so he flattens himself against the corridor wall
trains his gun on the stairs
just as the terrorists descend marshall squeezes off a few rounds
the terrorists edge back up the steps returning fire
marshall checks his clip not many bullets left
he fires off a few more shots to buy some time then ducks round the corner and pulls out the bottle of rubbing alcohol and some gauze
the terrorists seize the moment of quiet descending the stairs to take position
marshall lights the gauze fuse of his new made molatov cocktail and throws it down the corridor
the bottle crashes into a ball of flame
catching bazylev on fire
he yells drops and rolls
fire suppressing foam immediately sprays down from overhead
go after him
serge hops bazylevs burning body and heads down the corridor looking for this new wildcard
korshunov grabs a fire extinguisher from the galley and attends to bazylev
marshall retreats behind a divider
sees serge coming
fires a few rounds then retreats to the next divider
working toward the rear of the plane
serge picks his way through the rear cabins advancing cautiously
marshalls out of plane
nowhere to hide in the galley
marshall eyes the bathrooms doors flapping
as he reaches the rear galley and bathrooms
marshall is nowhere to be seen
but the bathroom doors are all closed
i know youre in there
come on out
a few beats okay
have it your way
time for a deadly version of the shell game
serge fires several rounds into the first closed bathroom door
the bullets slice easily through the thin doors
he kicks the riddled door open
the stall is empty
serge moves to the next one
moves to the last bathroom confident hes got him
he wails with his mp turning the hatch into swiss cheese
waits a beat then
kicks it in
its empty too
serge looks around
where the hell is this guy
calling down serge
serge reluctantly returns to his group
marshall tumbles out of the cramped galley dumbwaiter breathing heavy
he slumps against the bulkhead and slides down to the ground
he takes a moment to pull himself together to clear his head
he hefts the mp refamiliarizing himself with the weight and texture of a gun
he checks the clip
only a handfull of rounds left
he slaps it back in and switches from automatic fire to single shot then pantomimes firing
the nrall love this
looking down the barrel of the gun he notices bins loaded with luggage
stoli petrov on the phone behind his large oak desk
i understand your dilemma vice president chandler
but unless you can confirm that your president is indeed a hostage i cannot release stravanavitch
if marshall is dead no good will come of meeting this demand
we both know he would agree
but the first lady
is not a first lady if her husbands been killed
then shes a civilian
and i cant release him for a civilian
do you see my point
each member of the crisis team is either on the phone or huddled with staff
a secure fax machine spits out papers which lee slips into files
lee interrupts chandler on the phone
madame vice president
we have an options paper
chandler takes the options paper waves off lee and reads it as she talks
youve made yourself quite clear
but i will deploy forces to a staging area near the turkmenistan border
when you have more information we can decide how to proceed
by then ill be president
chandler hangs up the phone
of f options paper i dont like any of these
from did you brief general northwood
northwood pops out of his huddle
anticipate their landing site and get strike teams in place
can we do that
weve got four hours before they make it into turkienistan airspace
ive got a satellite passing overhead in twenty minutes
we can narrow down the landing site choices based on runway length and any unusual activity
with luck well only have to capture three or four sites
but they start executing hostages in i hate to be pragmatic but theyll sacrifice pawns before kings
it may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff
also i want you to put our bases in turkey on alert and have the kitty hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike
madame vice president
ive not discounted your theory hr
i got the new numbers from our gamers
they believe that theres only an eight percent chance that the president is still alive
eight percent is better than zero
what is that
chandler refers to a monitor in the rear of the room
cnn the omnipresent player on the world political stage broadcasts video from ramstein air base
the presidential aircraft was enroute from moscow when it began its mayday hail
but in a startling turn of events the seemingly out of control plane aborted its landing and took off again
we havent been able to confirm its status or whether or not the first family was onboard at the time
would someone get the press secretary
hes been holding on line four
air force one lit up by moonlight
the fire is extinguished
zedeck squats over nevskys body
gibbs and serge maintain a defensive position guns ready
bazylev emerges from the senior staff conference room
he shakes his head no
korshunov nods and furrows his brow
who did this
we checked the manifest
everyone was accounted for
a secret service agent
it must be
wounded but alive
serge and bazylev lock and load head off in separate directions
the conference room is no longer secure
well take the first lady and the girl up top where we can keep a closer eye on them
the hostages have torn up a section of carpeting
caidwell and shepherd examine the floor
smooth sheets of steel riveted together
were not getting out that way
the door swings open and gibbs and korshunov enter
they spots the ripped up carpeting
admirable but youre wasting your time
marshall would you and your daughter please come here
they dont move
korshunov raises his gun points it a shepherds head
now or he dies please
come on alice
doherty steps forward
shepherd tries to pull him back to no avail
youve got the better part of the white house locked in this room you know
if you want to negotiate were the ones to do it with
korshunov shoots doherty through the head
screams from some of the hostages
korshunov squeezes off a few shots to quiet everyone
if you please
rose turns to the other hostages
do what youre told
well be okay
she locks eyes with caldwell
n he nods
the president hunts through luggage
overturned garment bags and suitcases around him belongings littered all over the bulkhead
he sifts through heaps of clothing and finally recovers what hes been looking for
he flips it open starts to dial
he cant remember the number
the phone rings
bazylev moving like a commando slowly and methodically works his way into the lower galley
finally the phone picks up
how can i assist you
can i help you
yes the number for the white house
the rest area consists of a couple of bunks behind the cockpit area still soiled black from the earlier c explosion
korshunov pours a cup of coffee and offers it to alice
i dont drink coffee
you must be tired
itll wake you up
no thank you
the gunfire did that
gibbs wraps roses hands behind her back with duct tape
leave my daughter alone
or you will do what mrs
beat he chuckles but i admire your courage
your husband on the other hand
what do you know of my husband
i know he left you behind
my husband is a very courageous man
your husband is a coward
he sends soldiers half way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night
alice sits up attentive
youre one of stravanavitchs men
so you study world events little one
thats good for a girl your age
yeah i study world events
five thousand turkienistan muslims were slaughtered in stravanvitchs cleansings
along with american school kids
you know hqw i studied that
i went to their funerals with my dad
i met their parents
smart for your age eh
top of your class
tell me do you know what the word propaganda means
do you know what the word asshole means
rose doesnt know whether to be pissed at alice or proud of her
korshunov smiles nods his head and lifts his gun
yes i have heard that word
he aims his gun at alice
yes i am an asshole
a long beat the korshunov lovers the gun
your father is a reasonable man
once he hears our simple demand im sure he will acquiesce
for your sake
gibbs grabs alices hands and pulls them behind her back
begins wrapping them with the tape
serge searches through the galley cabinets spots the galley dumbwaiter
now he knows where his quarry went
he angrily grabs a service cart and shoves it into the dumbwaiter disabling it
bazylev hears the beeps of a phone dialing
he moves toward the aft portal of the gangway
marshall waits as the phone rings
a chipper woman in her mid s picks up the call
white house switchboard
how may i direct your call
hushed urgency okay listen listen carefully
this is an emergency call from air force one
is the vice president there
who can i say is calling
this is the president
dont cut me off
this is an emergency
sir the president does not call this particular number
so whoever you are get a life before i have this call traced
you dont understand
this is an emergency
let me talk to anyone
the switchboard operator thinks for a moment
maybe she can have some fun with this nutcase
if youre the president whens your wifes birthday
look lady i dont have time for games
just put the
thank you for calling the white house
bazylev appears behind marshall
raises his gun
i should know this
gunfire in the background
are you there
her face says n
the switchboard operator pulls out a call sheet and finds a number
on the phone lying open on a heap of clothing
bazylev points the machine gun at marshalls head
hands away from your weapon
marshall doesnt move his np hanging at his waist
his hand inches from it
you dont want to die
with no options
slowly moves his hands away from the gun
on your knees
is anyone there
bazylev motions marshall to get on his knees
whats that in your shirt
marshall pulls his shirt aside revealing his kevlar vest
take it off
chandler on the phone
an aide waves trying to get her attention
my intention is not to escalate the situation but its a contigency that must be considered
to aide what
the switchboard says that someone called in claiming to be the president then she heard gunfire
callers gone but the lines still active
could be some crank watching cnn
trace confirms the call is coming from a white house staff cellular account
put it through down here
into phone hang on toni
the call comes in on speaker phone distorted muffled voices and the whine of an aircraft in the background
whats going on in the background
can we hear whats going on
dean picks up a phone
max get me willis
willis a grossly overweight man in his late forties surrounded by a monolith of high tech starts working his console
ten seconds mr
audio waveforms appear over willis console
he implements digital filtering routines cleaning up the sounds
the group listens intently
the call modulates distorts dissolves
hands behind your head mr
he is alive
im going to take your weapon now and then im going to take you upstairs to join the others
christ they have him
and if you make any sudden moves i will not hesitate to shoot
maybe they dont have him yet
northwood stares up at the tactical board
air force one
surrounded by the f l s
and maybe we arent so helpless
general northwood picks up a secure phone and dials
general greely air force one has automatic countermeasures right
everything we own is in that plane
so a single missile launched from a distance should be a mere distraction
into phone ramutein tower control please
getting it but the effect could be jarring
patch me through to your fighters
madame vice president
with your permission
marshall on his knees hands behind his head
bazylev his automatic pressed against marshalls forehead disarms marshall before stepping away
he slings marshalls mp over his own neck
studies marshall a beat
so youre the president
somehow i thought youd be smaller
marshall stares straight ahead tn silent defiance
bazylev kicks him in the gut
marshall doubles over wheezing
not so powerful now eh
no aides to advise you no secret service to protect you no armies to command
bazylev grabs marshalls hair and tugs his head back
he holds marshall with his eyes
youll suffer for what youve done
so will you
bazylev slams marshalls face against his knee
marshall slumps forward
get up now
marshall slowly rises to his feet
bazylev swings wide around him
you will walk ahead
do you understand
no response do you understand
do you know whats going to happen to you because of this
do you know what the world will do
the world will do nothing
that is what theyve always done
serge seals off the second dumbwaiter
the squadron of f eagles hover around air force one
you want me to what
you heard the order
and do not i repeat do not take your best shot
okay boys clear the deck
i have been ordered to engage air force one
the other airplanes flare out giving distance to the jumbo jet
cantons plane drops back
assuming attack posture
targeting computer is on
on targeting computer graphics as it acquires air force one
target is acquired
i have good tone close on the flight stick
carltons finger over the firing button
theyre gonna court martial me for this
hands behind his head marshall walks in front of bazylev an mp pressed against his neck
carlton pulls the trigger
an air to air missile detatches from under the eagle
its tail ignites in flame
zedeck monitoring the controls
then all hell breaks loose as an entire wall of instrumentation lights up
what is this
the tactical countermeasures computer springs to life
high tech readouts risk analyses schematics and assessments
radar tracks the incoming identifies it
on screen autopilot disengaged the plane banks into a dive throwing zedeck back against his chair
get in here
on screen activating countermeasures with no oneat the controls air force one goes into a sharp sloping dive
bazylev thrown off balance tries to keep his gun trained on marshall
the missile follows a wide arc toward the banking plane
gibbs slides into the pilots seat attempts to regain control
what the hells going on
the americans fired at us
the tactical countermeasures computer electronic jamming has failed target acquired out the cockpit window the brightly burning tail of the missile closing on them
why would they fire on us
the tactical countermeasures computer missile closing metallic chaff burst standing by the computer counts down from eight
the missile screams toward the jumbo jet a slow easy target
im not a combat pilot
small bays doors slip open below the aircraft
a cloud of small metallic narticles sprays out of the bottom of the aircraft
on the faces of the terrorists as the missile comes right at them
then the missile veers downward
the tactical countermeasures computer missile neutralized the missile dives into the swarm of descending chaff and detonates lighting up the evening sky
red flames reflect against the silver grey clouds
the shock wave hits the aircraft
lights flicker and the plane rocks side to side
hostages are bounced around the conference room
marshall and bazylev are slammed against the ceiling and then the floor
marshall seizes the moment
grabs bazylevs gun
the two struggle and bazylez instinctively pulls the trigger
a burst of richocheting gunfire sparks across the bulkhead
the turbulence worsens
bazylev manages to wrest away the rifle but the plane pulls into a climb sending bazylev tumbling down the gangway into the rear baggage hold
marshall manages to pull himself up the grating and into the galley
hes free for the moment
gibbs steadies the plane as the shock wave from the explosion subsides
korshunov examines the tactical countermeasures computer
why did they do that
theyre trying to unnerve us
well it worked
korshunov smiles and puts his hand on gibbs shoulder
relax my friend
apparently they cannot harm us
even if they wanted to
marshall struggles to assemble the hypodermic and the container of adrenalin
bazylev pulls to his feet heads back down the gangway
marshall greets bazylev with a spray of hot coffee from the simmering pot as he enters
bazylev covers up but the spray sears him pretty bad
he yells in pain turning
marshall springs imbedding the hypodermic needle into bazylevs neck
a full dose of adrenalin
bazylev pulls the empty needle from his neck
marshall steps back waiting for a reaction
a pregnant pause as they both wait to see what happens
then bazylev smiles and slowly turns toward marshall
marshall backs away as bazylev levels his gun
he fires once hitting marshall in the arm
marshall winces off the pain
disgust the leader of the free world
he backs marshall against a wall and holds him in his sights
but he doesnt shoot
his breathing becomes faster and faster as the adrenalin takes hold
he screams and clutches at his throat
his eyes spin back and then his heart explodes
bazylev is caught frozen suspended in a moment of disbelief
he fires off several rounds from the gun as he collapses
marshall waits a beat half expecting bazylev to rise
he slowly approaches the body and retrieves the kp
the f lss pull back into formation around the jumbo jet
marshall retrieves the phone then wedges himself behind a waste storage tank out of view
rose and alice on the bunk
alices eyes are watering
korshunov examines topographic maps in the adjacent m c
and speaks into a phone in russian
im sorry i was so mean to you earlier
rose smiles sadly
i know sweetie
beat youre being very brave
serge finishes his sweep of the upper level
to zedeck hes not up here
im going down below
marshall rips his sleeve off swabs the blood off his arm
bazylevs bullet took out a good chunk of flesh when it grazed him
did they say anything about my family
theyre still alive but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes
then tell me theres a rescue operation underway
marshall opens a travel bottle of vodka and pours it over the wound
he winces from the pain
i think were okay sir
flow that we know youre alive we can force petrov to release stravanavitch
marspari dont tell me you plan to give in to these fuckers
general normwood we plan to do whatever it takes to keep you alive sir
and if that means negotiating
you know my policy
we dont negotiate with terrorists
if we start now all of america becomes a target
but this is different sir
youre the president
and what happens when stravanavitch is freed and discovers hes got the president
you think for a second that that crazy bastard is just gonna turn me over
hell ask for the goddamn moon before hes done
youre going to get yourself killed
is that your solution
freeing stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed
i cant live with that
somewhat resigned im not royalty
im an elected official and the integrity of the office of the president is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office
beat we dont negotitate
not as long as im president
is that understood
a long silence then
flow is there a rescue operation under way or not
lee shakes his head at chandler signalling dont tell
hes not on a secure line
marshalj whoever said that shut up
walter are you there
im here mr
wheres the cavalry
we cant do anything until that plane lands
and when it does land sir its going to be in hostile territory
to be perfectly honest we dont know what the hell to do
its going to take a miracle to figure this one out
a long beat
we hold on marshalls determined face
ill see what i can do
serge comes across bazylev
checks for any sign of life
stone cold dead
he looks around and grips his gun a little tighter as he backs out of the room
serge closes the stair access panel to the baggage deck
sealing marshall off
serge comes trotting up the stairs and collects new clips
bazylev is dead
korshunov swallows hard
trapped on the baggage deck
let me go finish him
he has the advantage down there
bring me a hostage
marshall sees that the stairway hatch has been sealed
marshall hits the button for the dumbwaiter
the dumbwaiter begins to descend then snags on the service cart
its motor grind to a halt
marshall slumps dqwn
his hopes dashed
nothing to do now but wait
serge looks over the crowd of hostages like a bouncer at a hip dance club
his eyes fall on maria mitchell
come with me
marshall seated on the floor
the cabinet next to him is stacked with packs of complimentary cigarettes all with the seal of the president
what the hell
he opens up a pack and puts the cigarette in his mouth
he snags one of the presidential lighters tries to light it several times but it only sparks
xc shakes it
its out of tial
he tosses it aside and reaches for a book of matches but he freezes in mid reach
a thought occurs to him
murmuring out of fuel
marshall lacking a screwdriver levers open the hatch to the avionics compartment with the barrel of his gun
marshall sees the stacks of panels piping wiring electronics
come on where are you
he searches up and down
serge leads maria mitchell up the stairway
maria is scared she says nothing
she looks over to the first lady and alice
korshunov switches on the airplanes p
please tell me your name
and what is it you do ms
maria mitchells voice echos over throughout air force one
marshall halts his search to listen
im responsible for press relations for the flight office
how are your fellow hostages feeling ms
rose cradles alice both of them looking away as korshunov raises his gun pointing it at mitchell
and why are you scared
because i dont want to die
the hostages listening
and what am i doing at this very moment
marshall listens helpless to do anything
youre pointing a gun at me
thank you ms
did you hear her
she said im pointing a gun at her
now to the secret service agent in the baggage deck
im giving you ten seconds to surrender or this women will die
marshalls eyes widen
marshall tries to decide what to do
he climbs out of the avionics compartment and hurries to the front baggage compartment
zedeck and serge wait by the stairway hatch
hostages wait expectantly
marshall frozen near the bottom of the steps
to go up would be to betray everything he believes in and lose any chance to save the others
but if he stays
tears stream down maria mitchells face
shes trying so hard to be brave in front of rose and alice
for marshall this is the hardest decision of his life
his face a mask of anguish as he wrestles with his conscience
he starts toward the stairs
korshunov looking down the barrel of the gun
it takes every bit of training and will to stop marshall from going up those stairs
he knows whats going to happen
he closes his eyes tight as if that will stop it from happening
a long silent beat
marshall sinks to to his knees
hostages hold each other tight for comfort
a mournful silence fills the room
marshall silhouetted in the half light craddles his head head in his hands
the shaft of light disappears as the main cabin hatch closes sealing him off once again
ill give you a few minutes to think about that one and then well try again
perhaps soon i will choose somebody important
to himself she was important
zedeck and serge drag the dead woman out of the compartment
alice sobs quietly
do you have to be so brutal
do you enjoy it
i neither enjoy nor dislike
i do what is necessary
how can you
i mean theyre people
but they are not ny people
you look at me as if i am a monster but answer me this when your planes bombed the oil fields of iraq did you cry for those dark skinned
men whose names you do not know and whos faces you will never see
did you cry for their wives and children
they were people too yes
but they were not your people
that was war
so is this
beat come now youre upsetting the little one
the woman you shot
she was my friend
thats the way of the world little one
didnt they teach you that in school
marshall crosses back to the avionics compartment talking on the phone
through static chief mechanic th air
how can i help you
you can talk me through an emergency fuel dump
led off to slaughter one at a time
next time i say we rush em
they cant shoot us all
they can shoot enough of us
if we dont act theyll kill us all eventually whos with me
several of the hostages raise their hands
the chief mechanic has air force one schematics open in front of him
he and his staff are huddled around them
do you see the maintenance panel
pop it open
there should be a red switch toggle it up
okay its on
weve got some indicator lights here
okay youre aerated
to dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump
theres no switch in avionics so youll have to cross the wires
there should be five wires just to your left
do you see them
marshall finds the wires red white blue green and yellow
static blankets the conversation
okay hang on
let me double check here because if you get the wrong ones youll cut the engine feeds and stall the plane
the static worsens
marshall using a kitchen knife slices the green wire
the phone beeps
the static overwhelms the voice then cuts out
static comes roaring back and garbled voices
are you there
marshall tries to activate it again
he tosses the dead phone aside
cross the green wires with the
red white blue
or the yellow
his choice is obvious
he cuts the yellow wire and crosses it with the green leaving the red white and blue standing
the engines continue to groan
he allows himself a smile
an emergency landing in friendly territory
theres your goddamn miracle
beneath the plane a trickle of gasoline appears and grows into a strong steady stream
a red warning light flashes on the planes panel
were losing fuel
korshunov crosses to the flight deck
its the only place
you better get zedeck down there fast unless of course youd rather be a martyr than a savior
to zedeck go
and watch your backs
zedeck nods and dashes out of the cabin
zedeck pulls open the hatch cover to the forward front stairs
descends into the dimly lit underneath
serge descends right behind zedeck
zedeck spooked by the dark shadows senses hes being watched
hes down here
i can feel it
shut up and do your job
zedeck hastens toward the avionics compartment gun at the ready
serge sweeps the area behind
they hear a metallic clank echo and reverberate around him
they both check left
its creepy being a walking target
from behind a water storage tank marshall watches down the barrel of his mp
with all the equipment in the way its almost impossible to line up a clear shot
and theyre both well armed
he looks toward the stairway instead
zedeck enters the avionics compartment
serge takes a defensive position outside the door
the valve is shut
this guy sure knew what he was doing
serge hears a noise and opens tire
you see him
erring on the side of caution
zedeck opens a panel and rips out some wiring
im going to deactivate the by pass pump
itll take a minute
gibbs checks the fuel gauges
they stop falling
weve stopped dumping
but weve only got about twenty minutes of fuel left
were not going to make it
not even close
hell we cant even make syria or iraq
where are we now
over the black sea
i can probably get us to turkey or georgia
if we land this plane anywhere else we will end up another entebe
beat the americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud evades missiles and
holding up maria mitchells press kit refuels in mid air
call the white house
tactical map air force one over the black sea heading south west toward turkmenistan
an aide holds up a phone
its him again
korshunov on the phone
gentlemen forgive me for diverting you from your little wargames but ive just added another demand to my very short list
i assure you its quite reasonable
we need fuel gentlemen
and we need it right now
lee whispers to the vice president
finally we can bargain
im sure we can strike some sort of arrangement
land the plane and well trade you hostages for fuel
the plane lands when i say or it will crash
the hostages are released when i say or they will die
tell me what i want to hear or i will execute a member of the senior staff and will continue killing one hostage every minute until we crash or until
a refueling plane arrives
murmuring and hushed discussion floats over the airwaves
a long silence
korshunov looks toward alice
shall i begin by executing the presidents daughter
shes right here
say something dear
fuck off you stupid asshole
it would be a pity to squander such a strong personality
another several beats of hushed murmuring
what do you say
fuels on its way
serge and zedeck lower the hatch to the baggage compartment and seal it
they head up the stairs to the m
korshunov paces weighing his pistol in his hand
we trained for months
everything shouldve gone like clockwork
we have the hostages were getting more fuel
hes already killed three of us and we havent even seen him
hes also shown that he can hurt us
i need to think
looks at serge what the hell are you doing up here
get back to the conference room
serge takes his position by the conference room
across from him against the cabin divider marshall peers down the sight of his gun
dont make the same mistake your friend did earlier
show me your hands
serge raises his hands
marshall reaches over and pulls out the clip to his mp
open the door
caldwell shepherd and a few other aides hear the key turn in the lock
they quickly take position around the door
as marshall marches serge in theyre both tackled and smothered by the group
they wrest the guns away and shut the door quickly behind them
marshall struggles against his people
its me goddamnit
let me go
surprised to hear their boss voice the aides and advisors release marshall
president how the hell did you get on board
i never left
wheres my wife and daughter
they took em out
theyre probably on the upper deck
president major caldwell here has a plan to get these hostages of f the plane
i dumped most of the fuel
theyll land soon and delta will take its shot
a refueling plane is already on its way so we wont be landing until we reach turkmenistan
your best course of action is to release me
i will be merciful
sir maybe we can use this
turn it to our advantage
caidwell the grounds a few miles away
how do you propose getting us from here to there
satellite pictures of various landing strips projected on wall sized monitors
of the three dozen airports in turkmenistan only five have sufficient runways for a
of those five only these three have shown any activity
general northvood points with a laser pointer
but this one here see this
its a satellite dish and it wasnt there two weeks ago
basic communications uplink which suggests extensive communicatins ability
id say this was the one
are you confident you can take the facility
its night there for a few more hours
thats a real plus
but i wont lie
as far as special ops go this ones a bear but i think we squeeze it out
lets get it going
the press secretarys about to go on
if we can get to a lower altitude we can use parachutes but at this altitude well pass out from oxygen deprivation
weve already played our cards major
theres no turning back
we cant jump from here or at this speed
but if we could get a message out tell the refueling plane
theyve cut communication and i spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives
my only solution ran out of batteries
a nearby secretary in her late s pipes up
the fax machines
the fax machines
dismissive no good
i said they disabled the communications system
i thought about this mr
voice lines and faxes are on two completely different systems of encryption
itd be easy to overlook the data systems
what do they have to lose
to caldwell get em ready
to secretary you
come with me
eighteen thousand feet sir
and two hundred knots
otherwise its suicide
caidwell holding serges gun takes position by the front stairway and waves the other hostages on
they emerge from the conference room and move to the stairway
marshall and the secretary rush the opposite direction toward the equipment room
amid shouting questions the press secretary alights to the podium
first let me
i have a prepared statement
the white house confirms that the presidents aircraft air force one has been hijacked and is currently controlled by foreign nationals
murmurs shouts and more questions
is the president onboard
what about the first family
what are their demands
for security reasons i can not comment on any specifics except to say that the vice president is doing everything within her power to resolve the situation
monitor on broadcasting cnn
were in the
korshunov turns toward the monitor
furrows his brow
and you are almost out of time
where is the president
marshall and the secretary step over perkins body on the way to the fax machine
marshall grabs a piece of paper and a pen
scribbles a note
where are we sending it
white house situation room
he signs the paper and hands it toher
she slides it into the machine checks the listed numbers and dials
someone should give you a raise
actually sir you could be that someone
will it work
a few beats a few beats more
the machine pulls the paper in and begins scanning
marshalls note spits out of one of the fax machines
but in the bevy of activity will it be noticed
caldwell spins open the rear emergency pressure door and leads the hostages into
a cargo hold extending up the tapered edge of the aircrafts rear
the hostages begin pulling parachute packs out of the overhead storage bins
helping each other
korshunov listens to zedeck yell into the phone in russian
still no movement on stravanavitch
korshunov eyes alice and rose
nor will there be
my husband does not negotiate with terrorists
you will be the first to pay for that mistake
caidwell assists everyone in strapping on their packs
he addresses one group mostly women and senior staff who belt into the larger chutes
these chutes are designed for a safe slow descent
theyll deploy off the line automatically as you step from the plane
turns to another group mostly younger men you guysll have to pull your own rip cords
wait until youre clear from the plane but not any longer
he checks packs and straps once i check you go stand behind the yellow line
two neat lines ready to jump
one line on the deployment wire and the other set for freefall
marshall and the secretary arrive
pwtshall the fax went through
we can only wait
ill not going without my family
caidwell crosses to prep the launch ramp controls
the gas gauges read very close to empty
korshunov stands behind gibbs while zedeck keeps an eye on the first lady
wheres that goddamn plane
caidwell watches the indicator
a kc the usaf flying gas station descends in front of air force one
air force one this is af ra
we have been instructed to refuel your plane
about goddamn time
please change course to zero seven four and drop to eighteen thousand feet
air force one acknowledged
the altimeter begins to fall
a wave of relief washes over the group
the kc extends its flying gas pump
air force one please reduce speed to knots
okay now kc pilot v
radio vent your fueling system
its the yellow lever on the upper control panel
and next to that theres a toggle switch to open your intake
roger kc pilot v
radio air force one do you see the fueling arm
through the cockpit window the long metallic appendage dangles ahead of the plane
ga get it
as air force one edges its nose up to the appendage
the appendage finds its grove and slides right in
thats it eighteen thousand feet
what about them
marshall indicates the four men without parachutes on
two air force crew members major caldwell and shepherd
sir we stay with the president
that isnt necessary
none of them changes his mind
a silent beat
a few forced smiles in this very tense room
i used to do this for a living caidwell pulls a switch on the wall
this take a moment
the president crosses to one of his aides
hey by the way
who won the duke game
find out for yourself sir
ill have it waiting at the white house
the kc flies above air force one connected by a gasoline umbilical cord
caldwell breaks safety glass
reaches into a compartment and pulls a lever
here we go
a mechanical him and clank gives way to a rush of wind as the tail section of air force one hinges open on hydraulic struts extending like a plank behind
we can see the sky with its angry clouds
rushing by at two hundred knots
a warning light flashes on the control panel
tactical video display shows the emergency parachute ramp activating
zedeck runs toward the conference room
he bursts through the doors
tracking zedeck sprinting to the rear of the plane
the tail cone section of air force one hinges open and parachutes begin to blossum from the rear of the plane
from several miles back carlton watches the chutes emerge
here they come
radio traffic echos through the room
so far ten chutes deploying of f the line
dropping signal flares for search and rescue
zedeck reaches the emergency pressure door
through the porthole he sees the hostages getting away
he tries the door hatch
zedeck looks around
crosses to the lower rear galley
he kicks open the panel on the stove
rips out the propane tank
he runs back and wedges the tank into the door lock
he backs off feet turns and opens fire on the tank
the tank explodes blowing the door out
the pressure door blows open and an explosion of pressurized air blasts through the platform
the remaining parachutists are blown out the rear
marshall and serge are knocked down the ramp tumbling toward oblivion
just as marshalls about to slide off the corner of the ramp he grabs its hydraulic strut
his grip is all that separates his dangling body from a long serge tumbles by marshall limbs flailing and with a scream woven from a thousand nightma he loses his
grip and slides off the ramp into the jetblack sky falling endlessly
shepherd and caldwell manage to hang to safety webbing as the wind whips around them
the two other air force crew members without chutes also manage to hang on
as the plane depressurizes it bucks like a wild bronco
marshall looks down into the sky
below his dangling legs parachutes blossoij
he cant hold on forever
gibbs fights the wheel
oxygen masks spring out from an overhead compartment as air is sucked out of the cockpit
the plane shudders and jumps badly
air force one back off
i repeat back off
gibbs wrestles with the yoke to no avail
i cant hold her
what are you doing
air force one jerks upward snapping off the fueling arm of the kc
the broken edge of the fueling arm scrapes along the top of air force one
metal against metal
tearing a gash in the plane
ignites the river of gasoline being pumped from the refueling crafts belly
gibbs sees the fueling arm catch fire
it doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure whats coming
the flames creep up toward the gas tanks
holy shiti gibbs pushes the stick down and air force one begins to dive to safety
air force one descends
whipping fire trails the kc
slowly rolls it way into the planes main tank
a burning fuse
sky like daylight
from this incredible firecloud the burned out skeleton of an airplane emerges falling toward earth
the f escort zoom toward the unexpected fireball
carltons planes go into emergency climb standing on their afterburners to escape the inferno
marshall hangs on to the strut for dear life as the pressurized air swooshes by him taking with it everything that isnt nailed down including some of the spare parachutes
fire rains down from the heavens the sky like one giant napalm nightmare
the shock wave hits the plane slamming it violently
almost yanking the hyraulic arm from marshalls grasp
the military aides without parachutes lose their footing and tumble off the platform
screaming as they fall into fire
the burning kc shell an apocalyptic flying dutchman in a vengeful kamikazee dive at air force one
its gonna be close
the flaming shell passes only a few hundred yards to the rear of the
marshalls got a great view
flames dance in his eyes as he watches the refueling plane descend
the brightness subsides and the sky grows dark again
the wave of pressurized air subsides leaving zedeck marshall shepherd and caldwell on the ramp
caldwell begins edging toward marshall
let me save him
marshall barely hangs on
that man he is the president no
yes he is
zedeck motions to caidwell with his gun
go get him
caldwell crawls down the ramp and extends his hand to marshall
zedeck leads marshall shepherd and caldwell away
gibbs steadies the plane
gibbs checks the guages
more than enough to get us home
the sun begins to set along the potomac in long streaks of red and pink
the white house lights flicker on uminating the long staunch columns the pillars of democracy
bickering within the small workgroups
chandler crosses to general northwood who has just hung up the phone
they still have the president its past their deadline and they havent called
what do you think it means
like any good poker player theyre checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard
zedeck leads the three hostage into the m
rose and marshall their eyes meet
enormous relief for the both of them
marshall smiles at his wife as she fights back her tears
to korshunov he didnt leave us
you are a resilient man mr
zedeck grabs caldwells hands and tapes them behind his back with duct tape
rose and alice already have their hands taped
you must forgive the tape but we were starting to feel outnumbered
gibbs puts the plane on automatic pilot
rises to join the group
korshunov separates marshall from his family
waves him into the com officers chair
his hands are now wrapped too
gibbs enters looking down
special agent gibbs
you helped do this
because it is my duty
youre duty to what
the country you served doesnt exist anymore
my loyalty was never to my country
i serve my commanding officers
you dont think the leaders of the kgb would allow peristroika to ruin years of infiltration
no when the soviet union collapsed we took our sleepers with us
korshunov holds up a telephone
now since weve had very little luck getting washington or moscow to cooperate i wondered if you would be so kind
over my dead body
but since i only have a few of your staff left to kill perhaps i will start with your family instead
gibbs grabs alice and shoves her into a chair
she fights him off and he smacks her across the face and shoves his gun into her neck
marshall and rose struggle against their bonds
the world is such a dangerous place and we cant always protect our children
you can kill me but leave my daughter alone
korshunov runs his finger down alices cheek
she isnt a part of this
this is between you and me
call up petrov and order stravanavitch s release
marshall looks to alice then rose then back to alice
this administration does not negotiate with terrorists
gibbs withdraws his pistol
places it against alices temple
perhaps a president does not negotiate but does a father
beat an interesting choice
your daughter versus your world vision
the implicit trust of a family against your oath of office
tears of fears are streaming down alices face
she looks into her fathers eyes
and once the trigger is pulled she is gone forever
then i wonder how do you live knowing you couldve saved her
marshall struggles with his duty
and could you ever forget the look on her face as she ceases to exist
late at night when you think about her will stravanavitch really matter anymore
marshall tries to look away but zedeck forces him to watch
look inside your heart
no one will think you weak
alices face trying to be brave
rose looks away
alice looks at her father for the very last time
then shuts her eyes tight
gibbs begins to squeeze the trigger
youll do it
yes ill do it
broken just leave my family alone
gibbs withdraws the gun from alices temple
alice opens her eyes and gasps for breath
bring him the phone
you are true to your nature mr
someday youll regret my nature
you dont like seeing people get hurt
now in morality that is a virtue
in politics however that is weakness
beat you were a hostage to everyone else long before you were a hostage to a sleepless petrov paces back and forth smoking a cigarette
the phone rings
he looks up expectantly as his aide answers
sir the president of the united states wishes to speak with you
petrov stops in mid pace
considers his cigarette for a moment and then walks over to the phone
a guard walks down the cold steel hallway
he rattles the bar of a darkened cage he pulls out a set of keys and unlocks the door
stravanavitch awakes and leans forward into the light
he and the guard trade looks
after a beat the guard turns and retreats down the the hallway
stravanavitch rises from his bunk and approaches the cell door
he leans against it and it swings open
rose stares at marshall
her look is hard to read
can my husband sit next to me
korshunov considers the pair
hands taped behind their back
marshall rises and joins her on the pilots rest bunk
i dont know why you stayed
dont start with me
rose moves closer to him and speaks in a low voice
theres something i need to tell you
and god knows if ill ever get another chance
from behind we see her push his taped hands away
he looks at her quizically
no matter what happens you have been and always will be my hero
he feels the wall behind him
a dull edge of metal twisted slightly from the earlier cockpit door explosion
and you have always been my guardian angel
she smiles back at him
i will never regret my life with you
behind marshalls back he begins to cut away at the duct tape
ivan stravanavitch walks down the long prison hallway
other prisoners see him and begin banging on their bars in rhythm
as he parades down the corridor the banging grows until it becomes deafening
stravanavitch smiles a cocky smile
one by one guard doors swing open in front of him
in fact a few of the hacks salute stravanavitch as he passes
the communication board beeps and zedeck picks up the line
he exchanges some words with the caller in russian then hangs up the phone
stravanavitch is on his way out
our men are waiting outside
korshunov smiles and puts his hand on zedecks shoulder
you got what you wanted
you going to release us now
youre very valuable
and our nation needs so many things
marshall leans his head against the wall
just as he expected
could i have some water
korshunov nods motions zedeck to take care of it
zedeck reluctanty descends to the main cabin
the taste of defeat is bitter no
one thing ive learned as president
all defeats are temporary and all victories are temporary
today conquerers are tomorrows vanquished
e very poetic
zedeck arrives with a glass of water
and theres one thing ive learned from being a sports fan
zedeck brings the cup of water to marshalls lips
marshall tips his head back to receive it
and that is
water spills over marshalls face
he shakes it off
it aint over til its over
with blinding speed marshall leaps to his feet and swings his arm around zedecks throat
he snaps zedecks neck with quiet efficency
gibbs fires at marshall but marshall using zedeck as a shield grabs hold of the terroristsmp and lets loose
mowing down the former secret service agent
the rest of gibbs shots pelt against the cockpit controls sending showers of sparks flying
korshunov whips out his gun and lines up a clean shot at marshalls head
korshunov fires at marshall but
major caidwell dives in front of the bullet spray taking the rounds in his chest
marshall turns his aim to korshunov
but korshunov grabs alice and presses his pistol to her head
dont be hasty
marshall holds korshunov in his sights
you love your daughter mr
and i love my country
its a fair trade
korshunov backs away to the steps
marshall does not lower his gun
korshunov disappears down the staircase
marshall unwraps shepherds hands
to rose ill be back
both of you
marshall slowly descends the steps to the main cabin
as soon as shepherd gets her hands loose rose rushes to caidwells aid
shepherd crosses to the communications panel and picks up a headset
begins dialing numbers in his nightdress stoli petrov nurses a vodka on ice
petrovs eyes widen
a wall of bars part and stravanavitch walks through
into the main exercise yard
the main gate separates him from
a group of men wait in the street by a limousine
the main gate opens slowly
when the men sees stravanavitch they come to attention and salute him
stravanavitch returns the salute
and then starts his march toward his limousine
the front gate begins to close
worry crosses stravanavitchs face
his men rush toward him take position by the gate
stravanavitch breaks into a run toward his limousine
stravanvitch looks behind him
guards rushing toward him from the yard
the limousine fifty yards ahead of him
on the limo
the back door open and waiting
a shot rings out from the guard tower followed by another and another
like popcorn starting to pop
stravanavitchs men return fire
a minor war breaks out
loyal guards battling stravanavitch sympathizers
stravanavitch caught in the middle hit by one bullet then another then another
he makesit to the open rear door of the limousine but collapses dead
everyone stops firing
stravanavitchs men rush to his side
petrov slips under the covers as an aide knocks on his door
what is it
its about stravanvaitch
what about him
hes dead sir
shot while trying to escape
so be it
the world will sleep easier
petrov turns out his bedside light
marshall ascends down from the upper deck
spots korshunov by the front stairway
korshunov pushes alice down the stairs to the underdeck
a shower of sparks erupts from one of the bulletholes in the panel
the course heading drifts off to the south
the squadron of f still surround air force one which slowly banks to one side
theyve changed their bearing
into headset air force one
air force one
air force one please respond
sir this new bearing
were headed for iraq sir
unaware of the course drift shepherd and rose lift caldwell onto a bunk
you saved his life
caidwell smiles settles peacefully back in the cot
rose reaches up and shuts his eyes
marshall makes his way through the dimness
a shot rings out and richochets off a piece of piping right over marshalls head
undaunted marshall advances
its over korshunov
now let her go
he listens footsteps ahead of him
on korshunov holding alice by her hair practically dragging her over the mid section wing cross braces
as marshall appears in the gangway he fires off another shot hitting a cooling vent
steam fills the gangway area bathed in red auxiliary lighting
korshunov retreats toward the rear of the plane
theres nowhere to go
a cacophony of arabic
the radar indicates an apparent invasion force heading for its borders
iraqi pilots rush to their migs
all eyes on the tactical display
air force ones course has arced south and the plane is heading straight for iraq
they arent answering their hails
this doesnt make sense
how close are they
general northiqood fifteen miles so two minutes
the iraqi ambassador wont take our calls
were trying to get through to their central command
to tell them what
the great infidel himself is flying overhead go get him
this is a man they burn in effigy daily
if challenged our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission
iraqis wont buy it
either theyre already in on this or theyll think were spying
if fired upon tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage
marshall checks behind the racks of stored goods and luggage
a finger on the trigger
dad look out
korshunov fires and marshall dives out of the way
he cones up in defensive crouch ready to shoot but all he can see is alice
how you doing sweetie
been better dad
marshall smiles briefly
but alice is yanked around the corner
marshall hears foatsteps
he junps to his feet and cautiously follows
on the tactical display as a second group of fighters appear
ready to challenge the f l s
air force one and the cluster of f s zoom by
air force one
air force one you are entering hostile air space
air force one
all carlton receives is static
nobody at the wheel
the automatic pilot is still engaged
carlton okay guys time to earn your paychecks
stay in protective formation and do not engage i repeat do not engage
unless you are fired upon
all wings acknowledge
halo one acknowledged
halo two acknowledged
the rest of the pilots chime in
marshall swings into the cubicle
he crosses to the cargo bay parachute launch ramp hatchway
looks through the porthole
korshunov straps on one of the few remaining parachutes
he tosses the rest of the spares out onto the platform
marshall steps onto the platform
korshunov fires off a round forcing him behind the door for cover
korshunov pulls alice in front of him and yanks down the ramp activation lever
stay where you are
the ramp lowers and alice gets her first look at the drop
marshall watches the remaining parachutes slide off the ramp and into the stormy sky
there goes your ride
let my daughter go or ill take you out
if you put down the gun i promise not to drop her on the way down
korshunov backs toward the edge of the ramp pulling a struggling and fighting alice
let her go now
or i will kill you
korshunov is a foot away from the edge of the ramp
two steps back he and alice will take the plunge
marshall lines up his shot
korshunov laughs as he presses his pistol to alices ear
no you wont
hold on alice
marshall fires his bullet ripping apart a good deal of korshunovs face and snapping his body back
korshunov tumbles off the platform but his limbs are caught
shes knocked to her belly and his dead weight drags her off the edge of the platform
marshall dives down the sloping platform reaching out for her
alice tries to grip the platform with her hands but she cant hold on
her hand slip off the metallic lip
but as she falls shes caught by the wrist
strong arms pull her up
her fathers arms
he carries her back to the safety of the plane
shes sobs uncontrollably
oh ny god
oh my god
oh my god
its okay honey
i got you
i got you
shepherd and rose appear
marshall locks eyes with rose
shepherd crosses to the parachute bins
theyre all gone
the plane shakes with the thunder of a supersonic boom
a half dozen migs race by the cluster of american aircraft at breakneck speeds
general cerallos eyes the radar
the americans say they are escorting a damaged plane
our pilots confirm they are surrounding a
did we warn them off
they refused to alter course and the would not answer our hails
cerallos takes a moment looking at the screen
its some kind of trick
a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement
they are in our airspace
we would be within our rights
the world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner
the soldier listens to chatter coning over his headset
the pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet
warn then again
if they dont respond
shoot them down
we will not be intimidated
another sonic boom
what is that sound
marshall makes his way to the cockpit
through the cockpit window a mig accelerates out of the darkness coming straight at us
at the last second it pulls up slightly riding over the top of the
its sonic boom rocks the jumbo jet
i think that was a mig
where the hell are we
marshall rushes back to one of the rear upper deck windows
he looks out at the f l s
theyre flying a protection formation
beat call d
find out whats going on
this is your last warning
you are violating our airspace
i said back off and hold your fire
we are on a rescue mission
do not engage
i repeat do not engage
a mig loops into position behind carlton
switches his targeting computer on
finds carlton in his sights
the pilot pulls the trigger
the missile detaches from the mig and slides toward carlton
carlton breaks formation leading the missile astray
his plane tucks into a tight little roll
the missile misses over carltons rolling wings
halo team this is group leader
halo team is cleared to engage
i repeat you are cleared to engage
carlton pulls his plane into a monster climb
this is the real thing boys
lets fly and fry
a ringing phone is answered by an aide
a few beats
its the chief of staff calling
from air force one
theyve retaken control of the aircraft
then tell him to get the fuck out of iraq
marshall settles into the pilots chair
shepherd comes in
were over iraq
shep youre fired
marshall looks at the planes bearing
the instruments are shot to hell
how longs it been since you flew sir
twenty five years
an f follows a mig into a barrel roll
the mig pilot targets air force one
he cuts his speed as he lines up his shot
gets a lock
arabic subtitle i have radar lock on the
on tactical computer radar lock dis engaging auto pilot the plane banks left into a dive
marshall grabs the yoke
finger on the trigger
can i take the shot
take the shot
looking forward from underneath an f the mig heads toward air force one
the f fires a sidewinder
on the mig
as it fires its missile
the f s sidewinder blows the mig up taking the missile with it
air force one is clear
for the time being
compensates and the plane rocks side to side
what are you doing
flying the plane
you havent even driven a car since you took office
marshall checks out the tactical display
im sure its like riding a bicycle
downhill with no brakes and somebody shooting at you
marshall finds the throttle pushes it up all the way
he feels the plane out gently nudges it into a turn
two migs flare out of an engagement with the f s and break toward air force one
we got two on the loose
someone get on them
i cant get there in time
the two migs lock onto air force one
each fires a missile at the presidents plane before breaking in opposite directions
a red buzz
its all marshall can do to keep the plane flying straight
we got two coming at us
tactical countermeasures computer
as it tracks the incomings
heat seekers launching flares brightly burning flares launch from either side of air force ones wings and descend toward earth
the missiles follow the heat of the flares plummeting harmlessly to earth
the shock waves from a nearby mig explosion shakes the plane
in the aftermath marshall takes a moment and pulls on the pilots headset
pilots this is air force one
copy air force one
welcome to the party
im on it
can you drop in front of me
ill follow you out
hang tough im on my way
on the two migs heading for air force one
an f drops in behind them
the migs scissor and break in opposite directions
the f l can only follow one of them
im tight on one the others loose
i need help down here
the other mig comes up on the and opens fire with his cannons
the shells rip up the surface of the aircrafts wing
the mig swoops past air force one and jerks into a vertical
on the damaged wing fuel starts leaking out and the outer jet engine catches fire
red warning light flashes on the control panel
weve got an engine on fire
shut it down
shut it down
marshall reaches over and toggles the shutoff switch
the engine whirs to a halt and the rushing wind blows out the fire
but now shes only got three engines
through the cockpit window an f settles in front of air force one
flames pouring out of its tail
under any other condition it would be pretty
alice rose and shepherd watch marshall fly
this is president marshall
i know you guys are busy but we need some help here
canton in pursuit of a mis
president its an honor
now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here
you read my mind

carlton breaks left lines up a mig and fires
he nails the iraqi aircraft
whos flying the fucking plane
im doing what i can
can you can you change your heading to zero four one point six
weve lost navagition
i dont know where that is
buzzer sounds in carltons cockpit
hes been locked on
somebody help me out
i got one up my ass
carlton puts his plane into a triple canopy roll then slams on his airbreaks
the mis shoots by him and carlton lets loose with his cannons
the mig pulls up and disengages
two and three are heading toward the boeing
were gonna arc a fat one to the right
cantons plane edges around to the right
and marshall follows
the leans at an angle and continues the turn until the f is dead ahead
another plane explodes ahead of him at three oclock
how we doing colonel
we still got three migs running around and six more on the way
cant you fly any faster
all eyes are glued to the tactical screen showing the dogfight
they listen to the radio traffic
were at full throttle
air force one migs four and five are on your tail
well get em off me goddamnit
two migs targeting the big bird
i cant get a lock
marshall struggles with his stick turning the aircraft to the right
of course its pointless
the boeing is a fucking sloth compared to these fighters
the familiar buzz
radar lock alice notices the computer
at the upper right hand of the screen the computer displays defensive mode offensive mode
defensive mode is highlighted
alice reaches out and touches the screen
not now pumpkin
alices touch activates offensive mode
along the belly of the aircraft two hatches pivot open revealing a series of missiles
i cant get good tone
take the shot
the f fires but the sidewinder screams past the turning higs
over graph display
offensive counter measures activatedw launching missiles the flying white house launches two sparrow missiles
the migs release flares but the sparrows dont flinch
twin fireballs erupt in the sky as the mics evaporate
but from the fireball a missile emerges coming right at air force one
boss they got one off
on the console
tactical computer flashes
system failure missile locked marshmj what did you touch
what did you touch
marshall checks display
its got us
the missile has air force one dead to rights crawling right up its tail pipe
just before its about to hit the plane
an f swoops up from below
like a secret service agent during an assassination attempt
the f takes the bullet in its mid section
the blast slams bits of the fighter plane against air force one
rocking it badly
chunks of the plane rip away metal sheeting on the s wings and tail section
we got six more bogeys closing fast from the south
a squadron of navy f s drops into the theatre
you air force boys get that plane out of here
well take care of those migs
kick ass navy
marshall works the controls of the
tries to engage the automatic pilot
the system is fried
marshall wrestles with the yoke
uh we got a problem here
just stay on my wing sir
ill take you all the way in
were losing fuel and my rudders not responding
lemme take a look
canton pulls up and drops back over the plane
he looks down at the boeings wing
youre torn up pretty bad out here sir
do you have any elevater control
i think its jammed too
uh tower we got a problem up here
sir i got some bad news
air force one
theres no way they can bring it down

marshall looks out the side cockpit window sees carltons f fly steady with his
im sorry sir
carlton salutes marshall
marshall returns it
thanks for your help colonel
general northwood collapses into his chair
theyve got no chutes
they cant control the plane their engines are failing and theyre losing fuel
i prefered the terrorists
thats game set and match
theres nothing to do except call the chief justice
the chief justice
what on earth for
to swear you in as president
dead silence in the room
general greely ambles over to the tactical map and just stares at it
he loosens his tie and scratches his head
wheres your strike team general
on their way back to turkey
i just had the craziest idea
kc lo transport plane
kc lo pilot romeo tango zulu
change of orders acknowledged
we are en route
the kc lo banks into a turn
alice rose and shepherd stand behind the pilots seat
into header is it our only option
then do it
marshall looks to the others
were now over the black sea so even if they could get us chutes wed drown or die of hypothermia before they could get to us
weve got one other option though
standard news shot
cnn reporter facing the camera
incredible yet unconfirmed reports of white house staff members parachuting from the plane while the president himself battled these terrorists
a family gathers around their t
set to hear the report
yet now in a bizarre twist of events cnn has learned that air force one has been severly crippled and is virtually unlandable and our sources report that the first
family is trapped onboard
a daring mid air rescue operation is said to be underway
how longs it been
twenty five minutes
they should be here any moment
fuels almost gone
up ahead navagation lights
there they are
okay im slowing us down
shepherd crosses to the forward cabin door
he follows directions for emergency door release
the emergency door opens and the emergency raft slide deploys
it inflates before being ripped from the aircraft gently wafting through stormy clouds
air rushes past the airplane at two hundred miles an hour
shepherd looks out into the night sky
inky blackness and greying clouds
the horizon though lightens as dawn approaches
shepherd spots navigational lights descending from above
its side cargo door is wide open
army rangers begin winching out three inch wide cable
the kc lo pratically on top of air force one
separated by forty feet
the cable slaps against the side of air force one and drags along its edge
as it slides past the open doorway shepherd grabs it and hauls it into the plane until he has its end
he hooks the cable to a metal clasp at the top of the door frame
hove into position
romeo tango zulu acknowledged
we are assuming position
a red light flashes on the control panel
engine number two grinds to a halt
the pressure guages drop to zero
we dont have much time left
rose bends down and kisses marshall on the cheek
i love you
i just wanted you to know that
marshall holds her with his eye
i love you too
beat were going to make it
alice throws her arms around her father
my school plays tuesday night
promise me youll be there
guages show fuel is low on the remaining turbofans
the transport plane dips into a lateral position
the two planes are connected by a hundred yards of cable
five army rangers in snatch harnesses slide down the cable bridge onto air force onefr as they hit the open doorway they unclip and sail into the main cabin
lets get you folks out of here
banks of television sets
shoppers watch intently
the audio broadcast plays over a map of the region and a graphic of air force one
tower air force one has been boarded
romeo tango zulu copy one the television graphics of the first family against the presidential seal
youre listening to an intercepted audio feed of radio communications between air force one and army special forces flying side by side attempting to get the first family off the
three army rangers harness themselves to the survivors
one to alice one to rose and one to shepherd
the other two head for the cockpit
alice and her ranger are ready
you can do it baby
hold on tight
the first steps a bitch
alice takes a deep breath closes her eyes
the soldier clips on the cable and shoves off the lip of the doorway sailing down the wire
they plummet alice screaming
the line goes taut
the pair slide the hundred yards to the kc lo
rangers grab them and bring them into the transport
shoppers listen to television sets galvanized
kc lo pilot the first daughter is on board
with a smile
two army rangers approach the cockpit
army ranger slides into the co pilots seat
ill take it sir
you get going
rose clips on to a rangers harness
they clip on the wire move to the lip and rappel off the side of the plane
as the first ranger leads marshall through the m
the soldier at the flight yoke slumps over dead
marshall and the first ranger swing around to see
a bloody but smiling gibbs lying on the deck clutching an the ranger draws his weapon
but gibbs swings his rifle around
pulls the trigger
hitting the ranger
the ranger returns fire shooting round after round at gibbs before pitching over dead
gibbs draws a bead on the president smiles
but he doesnt have any strength left to pull the trigger
and the plane begins to dive
marshall runs for the cockpit
rose and her ranger are pulled aboard the transport
shepherd and his ranger clip onto the wire but the kc lo is now higher than air force one
with marshall back at the yoke
air force one youre losing altitude
i cant hold it
the kc lo transport dips lower and lower trying to maintain its position under the descending plane
tower romeo tango zulu
the first lady is onboard
air force one status
weve lost two of your men
theres no one to fly the plane
we can send another one over
i only have one engine left
what about the president
hes on his way
with the kc lo back in the position shepherd and his ranger shove off the dying plane toward safety
the chief of staff is onboard
we are at six thousand feet descending rapidly
everyones biting their nails
i cant stabilize it
sir were going to pound pavement in less than three minutes
marshall holds the yoke in one hand and unclips the snatch harness from the dead ranger in the co pilots seat
the last red light on the engine control panel starts to flash
marshall still fighting the yoke stands
he takes a deep breatn drops the wheel and runs like a motherfucker for the stairs
drops into a banking twist
the cable line runs taut
the kc lo tries to compensate
marshall dives down the stairs from the upper deck comes up sprinting for the door
engine four fails
shes out of control
i cant pace her
the taut straining cable snaps one corner of the metal clasp
the clasp starts to bend
marshall sprinting to the open door
the clasp twisting
the cable hook ready to slip of f it
marshall clips on and dives out of the door
he slides forty feet down when
the clasp gives
the cable line snaps away from the plane
one end connected to the kc l the other connected to
marshall slides down the cable gripping at it trying to break his fall
air force one plummets toward the water
marshall sliding right behind it running out of cable
at the end of his rope literally
marshalls harness snags on the end clasp
he hangs on for dear life
moments later air force one impacts
a huge explosion water and flames blows sky high into the night
air force one is down
dead silence as all the patrons stare up at the t
i repeat air force one is down
romeo tango zulu
do you have the president
romeo tango zulu please respond
do you have the president
still no response
the massive fireball and glowing remains of the presidential aircraft almost reaches up to where the president struggles to hold on to the end of the cable
winch it up
winch it up
marshall slipping off the line unable to get a solid hold
his hands slick with blood
the belly of the kc lo gets closer and closer
ten mare seconds
he closes his eyes
his fingers begin to give
all over america families gathered around their televisions wait
romeo tango zulu do you have the president
romeo tango zulu this is tower
a long beat of silence then
romeo tango zulu do you copy
do you have the president
another long beat
this is romeo tango zulu changing call signs
beat tower alert air traffic romeo tango zulu is now air force one
beat this is air force one
the president is safe onboard

cheers flood the situation room

marshall huddles tight with rose and alice as a medic attends to their wounds
marshall turns to see this soldier a fresh faced year old kid saluting his commander in chief
welcome aboard sir
marshall returns the salute
the kc o soars into the emerging sunrise flying in the center of the remaining f l formation
