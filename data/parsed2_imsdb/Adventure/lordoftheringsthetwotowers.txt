camera pans over the misty mountains as voices drift in from the background
you cannot pass
i am a servant of the secret fire wielder of the flame of anor
camera pans closer to the mountain side
go back to the shadow
the dark fire will not avail you flame of udun
camera zooms in through the mountain and focuses on gandalf and the balrog on the bridge of khazad dum
the balrog strikes down on gandalf with its flaming sword
gandalf parries the blow with glamdring shattering the balrogs sword
gandalf strikes his staff onto the bridge
as the balrog steps forward the bridge collapses from under it and the demon plunges backward into the chasm
gandalf exhausted leans on his staff and watches the balrog fall then turns to follow the others
at the last minute the flaming whip lashes up from the depths of the abyss and winds around gandalfs ankle dragging him over the edge
he clings onto the bridge but is straining to keep his grip
frodo rushes forward but boromir restrains him
fly you fools
gandalf loses his grip and falls into the chasm noooooooooooooooo
gandalf loses his grip and falls into the chasm calls after gandalf as he falls into the abyss gaaandaaaaalf
gandalf falls after the balrog and grabs hold of his sword glamdring on his way down
as they continue to plunge into the depths gandalf hacks away at the balrog even as it thrashes and bounces off the walls
they continue to plunge at great speed sometimes with gandalf clinging to the horn of the demon
the battling pair then falls into an enormous cavern and plunges into the water
just then frodo awakens as if from a nightmare
what is it mr
just a dream
lies back down
frodo and sam climbs over the rocky terrain emyn muil
they look into the distance at the mountain of fire
the one place in middle earth we dont want to see any closer and the one place were trying to get to
its just where we cant get
lets face it mr
frodo were lost
i dont think gandalf meant for us to come this way
he didnt mean for a lot of things to happen sam
but they did
suddenly frodo feels and sees the eye zooming in on him
he gasps and pants as he backs away
its the ring isnt it
its getting heavier
clutches the ring by his chest and sits down still panting
he then fumbles for his water bottle and takes a sip
what food have we got left
well let me see
he takes out a package of lembas bread from his pack oh yes lovely lembas bread
he digs deeper into his pack more lembas bread
sam shows another package
he then breaks off a piece and tosses it to frodo and munches on a piece himself
i dont usually hold with foreign food but this elvish stuff its not bad
smiles nothing ever dampens your spirits does it sam
sam smiles back and then looks ominously towards mordor
those rain clouds might
they continue trekking through difficult terrain often huddling underneath their cloaks
looks around this looks strangely familiar
exasperated its because weve been here before
were going in circles
whats that orrid stink
ill warrant theres a nasty bog nearby
can you smell it
i can smell it
drops to a whisper were not alone
frodo and sam are sleeping
a dark shape appears on top of the cliff
the creature gollum has appeared and is making his way down to the hobbits
the filthy little thieves
where is it
where isss it
they stole it from us
gollum creeps closer and closer
we hates them
its ours it is
and we wantssss it
gollum reaches out his hand towards the hobbits
suddenly the hobbits spring up grab hold of gollums arms and pull him down
amidst the struggle gollum wriggles loose and leaps onto frodo
as frodo falls back the chain and ring around his neck is revealed and gollum jumps straight for the ring
sam tries to grab at him but is knocked away
gollum now jumps on top of frodo and tries to reach for the ring even as frodo grabs his hands and tries to push him away
gollums cheeks puff with exertion as he struggles with frodo his enormous eyes fixed on the ring
sam grabs hold of gollum again and tears him away from frodo
gollum then turns around and bites sam on the shoulder wriggles around and clasps his arms around sams neck and legs around his waist in a death grip
frodo unsheathes sting and holds it to gollums throat
menacingly this is sting
youve seen it before havent you
release him or ill cut your throat
slowly gollum loosens his grip on sam and as the latter disentangles himself gollum wails
in the next scene gollum is being dragged with sams elvish rope around his neck wailing and writhing in pain
it burns us
nasty elves twisted it
take it off us
sam tugs fiercely at the rope
gollum cries some more and collapses onto his back
sam turns to frodo in dismay
every orc in mordors going to hear this racket
lets just tie him up and leave him
that would kill us
its no more than you deserve
maybe he does deserve to die but now that i see him i do pity him
begging we be nice to them if they be nice to us
take it off us
we swears to do what you wants
theres no promise you can make that i can trust
we swears to serve the master of the preciousss
we swears on
on the precious
the ring is treacherous
it will hold you to your word
on the preciousss
on the preciousss
i dont believe you
gollum backs away frightened and climbs onto a boulder get down
i said down
sam jerks strongly at the rope as gollum tries to get away from him
he crashes onto the ground choking
hes trying to trick us
we let him go hell throttle us in our sleep
gollum lies panting and holding his throat
he backs away frightened as frodo approaches him
you know the way to mordor
nods warily yes
youve been there before
nods again yes
frodo reaches out and takes the rope noose off gollums neck
gollum seems surprised and relieved
you will lead us to the black gate
gollum scrambles off in the direction of morannon and the hobbits follow in his wake
a band of uruk hai marches across the plain with two hobbits bound to the backs of two uruk hai
pippin tries to call to merry who is unconscious with a gash on his right brow
he receives no response
suddenly an uruk hai puts up his hand and signals a stop
what is it
what do you smell
sniffs the air man flesh
quietly to himself aragorn
theyve picked up our trail
the uruk hai quicken their pace
pippin struggles to reach his elven brooch with his teeth
he then tears it off his cloak and drops it onto the ground
a foot stomps onto the brooch but it remains unbroken and visible on the grass
aragorn is lying with his eyes closed and ear pressed to the ground listening for the sound of footsteps
their pace has quickened
he looks up
they must have caught our scent
he runs off
come on gimli
looks back at gimli and then runs after aragorn pauses in his steps and huffs three days and nights pursuit
and no sign of our quarry but what bare rock can tell
runs after his companions
the three hunters run across rocks and plains with aragorn in the lead followed by legolas and gimli
from time to time legolas looks back to make sure that gimli is keeping up
aragorn suddenly bends down to pick up an elven brooch from the ground
not idly do the leaves of lorien fall
stops and turns to aragorn
they may yet be alive
less than a day ahead of us
runs off again gimli stumbles from behind some rocks and rolls to the ground come gimli
we are gaining on them
panting i am wasted on cross country
we dwarves are natural sprinters
very dangerous over short distances
the trackers come over a hill and pause as they gaze across the plains below
home of the horse lords
there is something strange at work here
some evil gives speed to these creatures sets its will against us
legolas runs ahead and looks out to the horizon
legolas what do your elf eyes see
the uruks turn northeast
theyre taking the hobbits to isengard
the tower of orthanc stands amidst the smoking caverns of isengard
saruman stands in his chamber communicating with the dark lord through the palantir
the world is changing
view changes to the tower of barad dur with its huge orc armies on a bridge
who now has the strength to stand against the armies of isengard and mordor
to stand against the might of sauron and saruman and the union of the two towers
camera pans upwards along the height of the tower of barad dur until the flaming eye is in view
together my lord sauron we shall rule this middle earth
the trees around isengard are being ripped down chopped up and used to feed huge furnaces
the caverns of isengard glow with the fires of industry sounds of hammering fill the air and molten iron is poured into casts to forge weapons
the old world will burn in the fires of industry
the forests will fall
a new order will rise
we will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fists of the orc
we have only to remove those who oppose us
saruman stands in the midst of a gathering of dunlanders
the horsemen took your land
they drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks
take back the lands they stole from you
burn every village
roars with approval argh
they stomp off to destroy the villages of rohan as saruman stands coldly still among the stampede
a rohan village is in pandemonium as people try to escape the on coming pillage
it will begin in rohan
too long have these peasants stood against you
but no more
a woman with her hand on a horse calls out to her children
you take your sister
youll go faster with just two
as morwen puts her onto the horse in front of her brother papa says eothain must not ride garulf he is too big for him
listen to me
you must ride to edoras and raise the alarm
do you understand me
starts to cry i dont wanna leave
i dont wanna go mama
freda i will find you there
a woman screams quickly
the children ride off
looks after them go child
dunlanders and uruk hai enter the village burning everything in sights as the rohirrim scream and run in all directions
eothain and freda weep as they look back from a distance
rohan my lord is ready to fall
a group of horsemen ride to edoras
eomer is in the lead carrying a gravely wounded theodred
eowyn runs hastily up the stairs to the golden hall and enters a bedchamber
she runs to the bed
theodred seems to hear her call but is unable to respond
he has a bloody gash on the side of his head
eomer nods to eowyn in the direction of theodreds torso
eowyn draws back the covers and upon seeing theodreds fatal wound her lips tighten and eyes close
she looks up to catch eomers eye
eomer and eowyn are speaking to theoden king who sits motionless on his throne wizened and aged beyond his years
your son is badly wounded my lord
he was ambushed by orcs
if we dont defend our country saruman will take it by force
that is a lie
appears from the shadows
saruman the white has ever been our friend and ally
mumbles feebly grima
grima leans down close to the king
orcs are roaming freely across our lands
killing at will
orcs bearing the white hand of saruman
he drops a helmet onto the ground which topples over to reveal the white hand of saruman
why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind
can you not see
your uncle is wearied by your malcontent your war mongering
eomer grabs grima and pins him against a pillar
how long is it since saruman bought you
what was the promised price grima
when all the men are dead you will take your share of the treasure
grimas eyes flicks to right watching eowyn as she walks by
eowyn stops to stare back for a moment before departing form the hall
eomer jerks grima again and clutches his hand around grimas jaw
too long have you watched my sister too long have you haunted her steps
grimas eyes look to the left and relax as eomer is suddenly pulled off grima by his thugs
you see much eomer son of eomund
the thugs punch eomer n the stomach you are banished forthwith from the kingdom of rohan
under pain of death
being dragged away argh
uruk hai and orcs continue to march across the plains with their hobbit captives with aragorn legolas and gimli hot on their pursuits
thats the key
theyve run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them
they continue running over vast distances
the uruk hai and orcs halt at nightfall many panting with exertion
were not going no further till weve had a breather
get a fire going
as the orcs and uruk hai take their rest pippin crawls over towards merry
opens his eyes i think
we might have made a mistake leaving the shire pippin
a group of orcs chops down the trees nearby for firewood
low groans and rumbles start to emerge from the forest
whats making that noise
looks towards the forest its the trees
do you remember the old forest
on the borders of buckland
folk used to say that there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall
and come alive
trees that could whisper
talk to each other
we aint ad nothin but maggoty bread for three stinkin days
why cant we have some meat
his eyes rest on the hobbits
what about them
they are not for eating
what about their legs
they dont need those
they look tasty
shoves at the orcs get back scum
the other orcs are getting restless
carve them up
moves towards the hobbits with his blade drawn just a mouth full
pippin and merry recoil in fright
ugluk jumps on the orc and cuts off his head which bounces off the hobbits shoulders
looks like meats back on the menu boys
the uruk hai and orcs cheer and started tearing into the fresh meat intestines flying taking their eyes off the hobbits for a while
pippin lets go
their hands still bound the hobbits try to crawl away
suddenly a foot comes down on merry and pippin is turned onto his back
brandishing a blade in front of pippins face go on call for help
no ones gonna save you now
suddenly a spear pierces the orcs back
mayhem ensues as riders of rohan burst out from their hiding places and ambush the orcs
gestures for them to make their escape
the hobbits try to escape from the pandemonium to the forest dodging bodies and stomping feet
suddenly pippin turns onto his face and looks up to a pair of thrashing hooves bearing down on him
the three hunters are still chasing after the uruk hai
it is dawn
pauses and looks up a red sun rises
blood has been spilled this night
camera pans over the rock and plains alternating between the band of uruk hai and the three hunters giving chase
the trackers hear the sound of horses
aragorn and company hide behind some boulders
a large group of horse men appears galloping quickly with their banners flying
aragorn comes out of hiding as they pass followed by legolas and gimli
riders of rohan what news from the mark
at a signal from eomer at the lead the riders make a quick turn and head towards them surrounding them in ever tightening circles
as they stop they point their long spears menacingly at them
what business does an elf a man and a dwarf have in the riddermark
give me your name horsemaster and i shall give you mine
eomer hands his staff to another rider and gets off his horse
aragorn puts a hand on gimlis shoulder
i would cut off your head dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground
legolas in a lightning fast move points an arrow at eomer
you would die before your stroke fell
the riders all point their spears closer at the travellers
after a tense moment aragorn pushes down legolas arm
i am aragorn son of arathorn
this is gimli son of gloin and legolas of the woodland realm
we are friends of rohan and of theoden your king
theoden no longer recognizes friend from foe
takes off helmet not even his own kin
the spears are withdrawn
saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over these lands
my company are those loyal to rohan
and for that we are banished
the white wizard is cunning
he walks here and there they say as an old man hooded and cloaked
and everywhere his spies slip past our nets
we are not spies
we track a party of uruk hai westward across the plain
theyve taken two of our friends captive
the uruks are destroyed
we slaughtered them during the night
but there were two hobbits
did you see two hobbits with them
they would be small only children to your eyes
we left none alive
we piled the carcasses and burned them
points to a smoking pile in the distance
nods i am sorry
legolas puts a hand on gimlis shoulder in grief
eomer turns and whistles
two horses move up
may these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters
eomer puts on his helmet and gets back on his horse look for your friends
but do not trust to hope it has forsaken these lands
to the riders we ride north
aragorn legolas and gimli look on as the riders go off
they then ride towards the burning carcasses
gimli starts to shift through the smoldering pile and pulls out a charred belt and dagger sheath
its one of their wee belts
with his head bowed and eyes closed hiro ith
may they find peace in death kicks a helmet and yells aaarrgghh
he falls to his knees
we failed them
aragorn looks to the side as some tracks catch his attention
a hobbit lay here and the other
flashback pippin yells as he looks up at a pair of thrashing hooves bearing down on him
he rolls over avoiding the hooves
merry and pippin crawl frantically away from the battle
their hands were bound
flashback merry rubs his bonds furiously against the sharp edge of a weapon
their bonds were cut
aragorn holds up a broken length of thick rope
they ran over here
they were followed
their hands freed the hobbits run away from the battle scene dodging under a horse and trying to stay out of harms way
as they flee grishnakh grabs pippin by his belt and clings on
pippin undoes his belt and grishnakh is left holding it
the tracks lead away from the battle
they break into a run and then stop into fangorn forest
the three looks up into a dense and dark forest fangorn
what madness drove them in there
scene moves from the trackers into the nighttime chase of merry and pippin
the hobbits run into the fangorn seeking to lose the pursuing orc
they collapse onto the ground out of breath
did we lose him
looks around i think we lost him
suddenly grishnakh appears from behind the trees brandishing a blade
im gonna rip out your filthy little innards
merry and pippin run and hide behind a tree
climb a tree
pippin and merry quickly scramble up a tree each
looks around and then sighs in relief
suddenly merry is pulled by his legs and falls to the ground
grishnakh leans over him with his menacing blade
merry tries to kick him off but to no avail
pippin looks down in horror but as he turns his head he spots a pair of gleaming yellow eyes blinking in the tree hes clinging to
the tree starts to move and groan
pippin loses his grip in fright and grabs at the air futilely as he falls
the tree catches him before he hits the ground
lets put a maggot hole in your belly
suddenly he senses something behind him and as he looks up the tree stomps and squashes him onto the forest floor
merry tries to run away but is scooped by the tree
looks at the creatures in his hands little orcs
its talking merry
the tree is talking
i am no tree
i am an ent
stomps slowly through the forest
a shepherd of the forest
dont talk to it merry
dont encourage it
treebeard some call me
and whose side are you on
i am on nobodys side because nobodys on my side little orc
nobody cares for the woods anymore
were not orcs
never heard of a hobbit before
sounds like orc mischief to me
tightens his hold on the hobbits and squeezes them
merry and pippin whimpers in pain they come with fire they come with axes
gnawing biting breaking hacking burning
destroyers and usurpers curse them
no you dont understand
maybe you are and maybe you arent
the white wizard will know
the white wizard
treebeard drops them on the ground and the hobbits look up at the white wizard
following gollum frodo and sam reach the end of emyn muil and see that mordor is now closer
see see we have led you out
hurry hobbitses hurry
very lucky we find you
gollum jumps on a rock
frodo walks past gollum shrinks as sam draws near
leaps after frodo putting a wide berth between him and sam
sams foot slipped into muck
whoa its a bog
hes led us into a swamp
a swamp yes yes
we will take you on safe paths through the mist
come hobbits come
we go quickly
gollum looks back and gestures for the hobbits to follow
i found it i did
the way through the marshes
orcs dont use it
orcs dont know it
they go round for miles and miles
swift and quick as shadows we must be
the marsh lands stretch for miles and miles as far as the eye can see
the hobbits and gollum appear as little specks
as the three pick their way gingerly though the marshes they see faces floating in the water still rotting and pale and flickering flames on the swamps
there are dead things
dead faces in the water
elves and men and orcses
a great battle long ago
turns to face the hobbits
the dead marshes
yes yes that is their name
dont follow the lights
sams foot slips again into the water
careful now or hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own
frodo is drawn to one of the faces in elven armour
he stares at it intently until suddenly its eyes open and frodo falls face down into the water
frodo is in the water and sees many faces of the dead no longer still but screaming and grasping their rotten robes and hair flowing about their gruesome faces
their hands are reaching for him
suddenly he is grabbed from behind
frodo sputters and gasps for air as gollum pulls him out of the water
looks at gollum in perplexed gratitude and disbelief
dont follow the lights
crawls away runs to frodos side
are you alright
frodo lies panting staring after gollum sam is asleep but frodo is still awake
he is holding the ring in the palm of his hand and stroking it mesmerized
suddenly he hears gollum
frodo quickly puts the ring back inside his shirt
he looks up to see gollum crouching away from him stroking the centre of his palm our preciousss
what did you say
master should be resting
master needs to keep up his strength
moves over and crouches in front of gollum who are you
mustnt ask us
not its business
gollum gollum gandalf told me you were one of the river folk
cold be heart and hand and bone
cold be travellers far from home
he said your life was a sad story
they do not see what lies ahead when sun has failed and moon is dead
you were not so very different from a hobbit once were you
looks up slowly
what did you call me
that was your name once wasnt it
a long time ago
suddenly the piercing cries of the nazgul are heard overhead argh
suddenly frodo feels the pain of the nazguls sword piercing him and the call of the ring
images of the ringwraiths come to him in flashes
frodo continues to clutch at the ring on his chest immobilized
sam drags frodo across to hide beneath some bramble bushes
the nazgul appears tightening his hold on the reins
camera then shows him riding a fell beast swooping down across the marsh lands
chilling screams of the nazgul fill the air
they will see us
they will see us
i thought they were dead
no you cannot kill them
a loud screech from the nazgul flying high above the marshes
wraiths on wings
they are calling for it
they are calling for the preciousss
frodo feels the call of the ring and gropes for his necklace
sam sees this and grabs hold of frodos hand
the nazgul continues to circle overhead and then flies off towards mordor
the black gate is very close
scene returns to fangorn forest
gimli fingers a dark stain on a leaf and brings it to his mouth
these are strange tracks
the air is so close in here
this forest is old
full of memory
groans reverberate through the forest and gimli raises his axe
the trees are speaking to each other
gestures lower your axe
lowering his axe slowly oh
aragorn nad na ennas
something is out there
what do you see
close up of legolas eyes the white wizard approaches
do not let him speak
he will put a spell on us
aragorn wraps his hand around the hilt of his sword gimli tightens his hold on his axes and legolas notches an arrow to his bow
we must be quick
with a yell the three swing round to attack
gimlis axe and legolas arrow are deflected
aragorn drops his sword as it becomes red hot in his grasp
they shield their eyes with their hands from the bright light emanating from the white wizard
you are tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits
where are they
they passed this way the day before yesterday
they met someone they did not expect
does that comfort you
who are you
the bright light dims revealing gandalf all dressed in white
the three are astounded
legolas and gimli bow
it cannot be
through fire and water
flashback gandalf is battling the balrog atop durins tower
from the lowest dungeon to the highest peak i fought with the balrog of morgoth
gandalf holds up glamdring and a flash of lightning strikes it before he plunges the sword into the balrog
with a final cry the balrog falls from the peak and lands smoking onto the icy mountainside
until at last i threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside
on top of the mountain gandalf crawls a bit and then collapses
darkness took me
and i strayed out of thought and time
camera zooms in gandalfs eye and enters an amorphous realm of stars and galaxies ending in a blinding white light stars wheeled overhead and everyday was as long as a
life age of the earth
but it was not the end
i felt life in me again
camera zooms out from gandalfs eye lying naked and very still
his hair has turned white and wounds are completely healed
he suddenly shudders with a deep gasp and pants as life returns to him ive been sent back until my task is done
thats what they used to call me
gandalf the grey
that was my name
he smiles gandalf
with a twinkle in his eye i am gandalf the white
aragorn grins and i come back to you now at the turn of the tide
they walk through the forest with gandalf leading the way now wearing a grey cloak over his white robes
one stage of your journey is over another begins
war has come to rohan
we must ride to edoras with all speed
outside the forest gandalf whistles piercingly
soon an answering neigh is heard and a white horse appears from the plain answering the call
that is one of the mearas unless my eyes are cheated by some spell
the horse comes round to stop in front of gandalf
gimli bows in the background
hes the lord of all horses and hes been my friend through many dangers
the three hunters and gandalf ride across the plains to edoras
back at fangorn treebeard is walking through the forest with merry and pippin sitting on his shoulders
my home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain
i told gandalf i would keep you safe and safe is where ill keep you
the trees have grown wild and dangerous
anger festers in their hearts
they will harm you if they can
there are too few of us now
too few of us ents left to manage them
frodo and sam are climbing a high rock overlooking morannon
the black gate of mordor
the enormous black gate comes into view with orcs patrolling and standing guard on the towers and atop the walls
from the right an army of easterling soldiers is marching to the black gate
oh save us
my ol gafferd have a thing or two to say if he could see us now
master says to show him the way into mordor so good smeagol does
master says so
orcs are patrolling the black gate
thats it then
we cannot get past that
a command is heard and an orc sounds a horn signalling for the gate to be opened
two enormous cave trolls stretch and growl and then pull the mighty gate open
the gate its opening
i can see a way down
he moves closer to the edge
suddenly the rock underneath him gives way and he falls
frodo goes after sam
two easterling soldiers see streams of dust coming down the cliff made by sam and frodo
they move away from the troop to investigate
frodo reaches sam who is stuck in the scree
as the easterlings move closer and closer frodo throws his elvish cloak over himself and sam
the soldiers are now directly in front of sam but their eyes see nothing but rock
frodo and sam peer from underneath the cloak
the soldiers soon leave and after a moment frodo throws back the cloak and pulls sam out
i do not ask you to come with me sam
i know mr frodo
i doubt even these elvish cloaks will hide us in there
they prepare to make a run for the gate
gollum pulls them back
no no master
they catch you
they catch you
dont take it to him
he wants the preciousss
always hes looking for it
and the preciousss is wanting to go back to him
but we mustnt let him have it
frodo tries to make a run for it
pulls frodo back again
theres another way
a dark way
why havent you spoken of this before
because master did not ask
hes up to something
are you saying theres another way into mordor
there is a path and some stairs and then
frodo and sam watch as the black gate closes
gollum is stroking frodos arm and burying his face in his cloak
hes led us this far sam
hes been true to his word
lead the way smeagol
good smeagol always helps
frodo follows gollum as sam stares after him in disbelief
on the plains of rohan
gandalf aragorn legolas and gimli stop as edoras comes into view
edoras and the golden hall of meduseld
there dwells theoden king of rohan whose mind is overthrown
sarumans hold over king theoden is now very strong
in the hall eowyn is kneeling before theoden holding his hand in hers
my lord your son he is dead
theoden just sits and stares ahead his eyes clouded and unseeing
will you not go to him
will you do nothing
scene returns to gandalf and company
be careful what you say
do not look for welcome here
they ride on towards edoras
at edoras eowyn is weeping at the dead theodreds bed
she kisses his hand
grima appears at the door
he must have died sometime in the night
what a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir
he sits on the bed and puts a hand on eowyns shoulder
i understand his passing is hard to accept especially now that your brother has deserted you
jumps back and throws off grimas hand leave me alone snake
rises from the bed and moves ever closer to eowyn oh but you are alone
who knows what you have spoken to the darkness
in bitter watches of the night when all your life seems to shrink the walls of your bower closing in about you like a hutch to trammel some wild thing
he puts a hand on her cheek and moves down to her throat
so fair so cold like a morning of pale spring still clinging to winters chill
eowyn and grima stare at each other intently
your words are poison
eowyn runs out of the hall
weeping she looks away into the distance
a flag comes off its pole and is carried by the breeze
eowyn sees riders coming towards edoras
as aragorn passes the entrance to edoras the flag floats down to land near him
edoras is silent and somber
everyone is dressed in black and staring at the newcomers in wary silence
aragorn looks up at the hall and sees a lady in white standing on the steps
he looks around at more somber people
youll find more cheer in a graveyard
aragorn looks up to the hall again but the lady has disappeared
the company climbs up the stairs to the hall and is met by guards
sees hama ah
i cannot allow you before theoden king so armed gandalf greyhame
by order of grima wormtongue
gandalf nods in understanding and signals for the others to surrender their weapons
aragon hands over his sword and knives
legolas gives a little twirl to his knives before handing them over to the guards
gimli hands over his axes reluctantly
gestures to gandalf your staff
glances at his staff
you would not part an old man from his walking stick
looks at hama innocently
hama hesitates for a second and then gestures that they follow him into the hall
gandalf gives aragorn a tiny wink and enters the hall leaning on legolas arm
leaning down and whispering to theoden
my lord gandalf the grey is coming
hes a herald of woe
the courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late theoden king
as gandalf approaches theoden aragorn legolas and gimli pull back and survey the hall and its hostile occupants
a group of men starts to follow their steps with hostility
whispering to theoden
hes not welcome
why should i
welcome you gandalf
looks to grima for affirmation
a just question my liege
he walks towards gandalf
late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear
lathspell spell i name him
ill news is an ill guest
keep your forked tongue behind you teeth
i have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm
raises his staff against grima
backing away from gandalf while addressing the guards i told you to take the wizards staff
the hostile guards attack
aragorn legolas and gimli engage them in a fist fight as gandalf continues to approach theoden
gamling tries to go forward but hama holds him back
theoden son of thengel too long have you sat in the shadows
grima tries to crawl away unnoticed but gimli catches him and pins him to the floor
growls i would stay still if i were you
hearken to me
i release you from the spell
gestures with his hand menacingly hahahhhahahahah
gandalf opens his eyes in surprise
you have no power here gandalf the grey
gandalf throws back his grey cloak exuding blinding white light
theoden is thrown back against his seat
points his staff towards theoden
i will draw you saruman as poison is drawn from a wound
eowyn rushes in
seeing her uncle threatened she tries to go to him but is held back by aragorn
in sarumans voice
if i go
gandalf moves his staff sharply and theoden flies back against the chair again
you did not kill me you will not kill him
in sarumans voice rohan is mine
gandalf smites theoden as he lunges at him
theoden is thrown back into the chair and the shot changes to saruman flying backwards from the palantir which he used to manipulate theoden
he lands landing hard on the floor of orthanc bleeding from a gash in his forehead
in the hall theoden lets out a moan and slumps forward in the chair
eowyn runs to her uncles side as he falls
theodens head rises again and his face begins to change gradually into that of a much younger looking man
clarity and recognition returns to his eyes
looks closely at eowyn i know your face
eowyn weeps with joy gandalf
breathe the free air again my friend
the hall is shown to be filled with light again as everyone marvels at the rejuvenation of the king
standing up and looking around him
dark have been my dreams of late
he looks down at his trembling hands
your fingers would remember their old strength better
if they grasped your sword
hama runs up with his sword
theoden reaches for it with trembling hands
he wraps his fingers around it slowly and then draws it gazing upon the shiny steel
in a corner grima trembles and tries to escape but is pulled back by gimli
suddenly theodens gaze turns to grima
grima is thrown out of the hall and down the stairs
beseechingly to theoden ive only ever served you my lord
advancing towards grima holding the sword firmly in his hand your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast
grovelling send me not from your side
theoden raises his sword to kill grima
aragorn holds him back
no my lord
no my lord
let him go
enough blood has been spilled on his account
grima scrambles to his feet and pushes through the crowd get out of my way
hail theoden king
the crowd kneels in homage before theoden
aragorn kneels also
grima rides out of edoras
as theoden turns to go back into the hall he looks up
where is theodred
where is my son
a white flower comes into view held up by a hand
it is released and spirals down to land among similar flowers in front of a tomb
ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers
looks at gandalf now it shall cover the grave of my son
alas that these evil days should be mine
the young perish and the old linger
that i should live to see the last days of my house
theodreds death was not of your making
no parent should have to bury their child
theoden starts to weep he was strong in life
his spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers
feru theodred feru
be thou well
go thou theodred go thou
gandalf turns to go back to the hall and leaves theoden to grieve in private
he spots two children on horseback
the boy collapses and falls off the horse
later inside the golden hall the two children are eating at a table and eowyn is with them
they had no warning
they were unarmed
now the wildmen are moving through the westfold burning as they go
rick cot and tree
this is but a taste of the terror that saruman will unleash
all the more potent for he is driven now by fear of sauron
ride out and meet him head on
draw him away from your women and children
leans forward and puts a hand on theodens chair
theoden looks at his hand warily
you must fight
you have two thousand good men riding north as we speak
eomer is loyal to you
his men will return and fight for their king
they will be three hundred leagues from here by now
eomer cannot help us
i know what it is that you want of me
but i will not bring further death to my people
i will not risk open war
gimli takes a bite of his bread as he watches the exchange between aragorn and theoden
open war is upon you
whether you would risk it or not
when last i looked theoden not aragorn was king of rohan
gimli takes a drink and burps
then what is the kings decision
scene shifts to outside meduseld by order of the king the city must empty
we make for the refuge of helms deep
do not burden yourselves with treasures
take only what provisions you need
people are moving about gathering their belongings and preparing to move
gandalf aragorn legolas and gimli walk towards the stables
they flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight
who will defend them if not their king
hes only doing what he thinks is best for his people
helms deep has saved them in the past
they enter the stables there is no way out of that ravine
theoden is walking into a trap
he thinks hes leading them to safety
what they will get is a massacre
theoden has a strong will but i fear for him
i fear for the survival of rohan
he will need you before the end aragorn
the people of rohan will need you
the defences have to hold
they will hold
turns to shadowfax and strokes him the grey pilgrim
thats what they used to call me
three hundred lives of men ive walked this earth and now i have no time
with luck my search will not be in vain
look to my coming at first light on the fifth day
at dawn look to the east
opens the stall gates go
legolas jumps back as gandalf rides out of the stable and over the plains of rohan
eowyn opens a chest in which lies a sword
she unsheathes it and begins to practice
she swings around and is met by aragorn who blocks her parry
you have some skill with a blade
with a swift move eowyn swings her sword and renders aragorn vulnerable gaining the upper hand
stepping back and sheathing her sword
women of this country learned long ago those without swords may still die upon them
i fear neither death nor pain
what do you fear my lady
to stay behind bars until use and old age accept them and all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire
you are a daughter of kings a shieldmaiden of rohan
he sheaths his knife
i do not think that would be your fate
he bows and eowyn gazes after him as he walks away
the people of rohan are moving out of edoras towards helms deep with theoden leading the way
at isengard grima confers with saruman holding a cloth to his mouth
theoden will not stay at edoras
its vulnerable he knows this
he will expect an attack on the city
they will flee to helms deep the great fortress of rohan
it is a dangerous road to take through the mountains
they will be slow
they will have women and children with them
sarumans eyebrows rise in response
he walks through the depths of isengard and gives orders to an orc
send out your warg riders
the orc smiles
in a pit behind him ferocious growls are heard and shadows dances
gollum is trying to catch a fish in the river
he slips and falls grasping at a slippery fish as he goes
frodo and sam follow behind
dont go getting too far ahead
why do you do that
call him names run him down all the time
because thats what he is mr
theres naught left in im but lies and deceit
its the ring he wants
its all he cares about
glaring at sam you have no idea what it did to him
what its still doing to him
he walks past sam and stops
i want to help him sam
because i have to believe he can come back
you cant save him mr
snapping at sam what do you know about it
sam walks away slowly
with remorse im sorry sam

looks back at frodo with tears in his eyes
its the ring

its taken a hold of you mr frodo
you have to fight it
grows angry again i know what i have to do sam
the ring was entrusted to me
its my task
he walks away cant you hear yourself

frodo continues to walk away without looking back
nighttime frodo and sam are asleep
gollum is crouching in a corner by himself
we wants it
we needs it

they stole it from us
sneaky little hobbitsesss
wicked trickssssy falssse
they will cheat you hurt you lie
masters my friend
tauntingly you dont have any friends

fiercely where would you be without me
i saved us
it was me
we survived because of me
resolute not anymore
startled what did you say
master looks after us now
we dont need you
leave now and never come back
louder leave now and never come back
growls and bares his teeth arrrgh
smeagol pants and then looks around
we told him to go away
and away he goes preciousss
he hops around in joy and does a little dance
gone gone gone
smeagol is free
the next day while the hobbits were resting smeagol comes back with two rabbits and drops them onto frodos lap
see what smeagol finds
frodo looks at up him with bloodshot eyes
he smiles at smeagol and looks at sam
smeagol raises a fist in self congratulation and dances around
he then picks up one of the rabbits and snaps the rabbits back in front of frodo
they are young
they are tender
they are nice
yes they are
he bites and tears into the raw meat
sam rushes over and snatches the rabbit out of gollums hands youll make him sick you will behaving like that
holding up the two rabbits theres only one way to eat a brace of coneys
a pot of stew is simmering over a fire
looking into the pot argh
whats it doing
stupid fat hobbit
it ruins it
whats to ruin
theres hardly any meat on em
a faint calling sound catches the attention of frodo
what we need is a few good taters
whats taters preciousss
whats taters uh
po tay toes
stick em in a stew
lovely big golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish
sticks out his tongue in disgust pbbbttt
even you couldnt say no to that
he takes a sip of the stew oh yes we could
spoil nice fish
scrambles up close to sam give it to usss rrraw
makes sickeningly happy face
you keep nasty chips
hops away youre hopeless
frodo follows the source of the sound
sam suddenly notices that frodo is no longer in his sight
he goes in search of frodo and finds him lying down near some bushes looking at a haradrim army marching across the land
he moves to lie low beside frodo
smeagol also moves in beside frodo
who are they
servants of sauron
they are called to mordor
the dark one is gathering all armies to him
it wont be long now
he will soon be ready
ready to do what
to make his war
the last war that will cover all the world in shadow
weve got to get moving
come on sam
suddenly grabs frodos arm mr frodo
its an oliphaunt
gigantic oliphaunts appear carrying soldiers and supplies on their backs
no one at home will believe this
smeagol slips away unnoticed
looking around smeagol
suddenly pandemonium breaks out from below the soldiers are being ambushed
cloaked rangers are firing deadly arrows at the soldiers and oliphaunts from behind bushes
one of the oliphaunts starts trumpeting and stomping towards frodo and sam swinging his huge trunk and tusks
faramir takes aim and shoots a soldier
he falls from the oliphaunt and lands right behind frodo and sam dead
weve lingered here too long
come on sam
frodo runs right into a gondorian ranger who grabs hold of him and throws him onto his back
sam sees frodo in danger and grapples for his sword ah
he charges at faramir but is grabbed by another ranger and thrown down
a sword appears at his throat
bind their hands
meanwhile the rohirrim refugees are heading towards helms deep
gimli is on a horse chatting with eowyn who is leading it by the reins
its true you dont see many dwarf women
and in fact they are so alike in voice and appearance haha that theyre often mistaken for dwarf men
eowyn smiles and looks back at aragorn
gestures and whispers its the beards
and this in turn has given rise to the belief that there are no dwarf women
and that dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground
laughs gaily hahahaha
which is of course ridiculous
the horse suddenly rears up and gallops away as eowyn loses her hold on the reins
gimli falls off after a short distance and lands with a loud thump
she rushes forward to gimli struggling to get up its alright its alright
that was deliberate
it was deliberate
eowyn helps gimli up
she laughs as she brushes him off and looks back at aragorn with the sun behind her and the wind in her hair
at that particular moment aragorn seems enchanted by eowyns light hearted image
aragorn could not sleep and smokes his pipe as he thinks of arwen
the light of the evenstar does not wax and wane
it is mine to give to whom i will
like my heart
go to sleep
aragorn is lying on a chaise in rivendell
he opens his eyes and sees arwen before him smiling down at him
i am asleep
this is a dream
bends down to kiss him then it is a good dream
she kisses him lightly on the lips and then steps away to look out upon rivendell
aragorn closes his eyes but for a while
he looks over at arwen
min lu pennich nin i aur hen telitha
you told me once that this day would come
turns to look at aragorn u i vethed
na i onnad
boe bedich go frodo
han bad lin
this is not the end
it is the beginning
you must go with frodo
that is your path
walks over to arwen dolen i vad o nin
my path is hidden from me
si peliannen i vad na dail lin
si boe u dhannathach
it is already laid before your feet
you cannot falter now
arwen hushes him resting her fingers on his lips
as her hands moves down to rest on the evenstar pendant around aragorns neck he clasps her hand in his and they gaze into each others eyes
ae u esteliach nad
if you trust nothing else
the next day on the journey to helms deep
eowyn is walking alongside aragorn
where is she
the woman who gave you that jewel
elrond is speaking to aragorn in rivendell before he sets out with the fellowship
our time here is ending
arwens time is ending
let her go
let her take the ship into the west
let her bear away her love for you to the undying lands
there it will be evergreen
but never more than a memory
i will not leave my daughter here to die
she stays because she still has hope
she stays for you
she belongs with her people
aragorn and arwen are together before the fellowship departs
idhren emmen menna gui ethwel
hae o auth a nir a naeth
you have a chance for another life
away from war
why are you saying this
i am mortal you are elfkind
it was a dream arwen nothing more
he takes arwens hand to return the evenstar necklace to her
this belongs to you
closes aragorns hand over the evenstar it was a gift
scene shifts back to aragorn and eowyn my lord
she is sailing to the undying lands with all that is left of her kin
gamling and hama ride to the front
legolas watches them as they pass
what is it
their horses become restless
looking around im not sure
a warg scout appears on a slope above and charges at them
the warg attacks hama and kills him
just as it starts to turn on gamling legolas runs over and kills the warg with an arrow
he then draws his knife and kills the orc
shouts to aragorn a scout
what is it
what do you see
running back to theoden wargs
we are under attack
hearing the alarm the villagers begin to cry and panic
get them out of here
all riders to the head of the column
trying to mount arod come on get me up here im a rider
gimli gets onto the horse with some help
legolas gazes into the distance and sees many warg riders coming fast towards them kicking up dust trails as they go
to eowyn you must lead the people to helms deep
and make haste
i can fight
you must do this
eowyn holds theodens gaze for a moment and then turn to attend to the villagers
to his men follow me
tries to get arod to move forward
i mean charge forward
arod moves off with gimli seated rather unsteadily
to the villagers make for the lower ground
she looks back at the rohirrim and sees aragorn on hasufel
they hold each others gaze for a moment before aragorn turns to join theoden
eowyn departs with the villagers in the opposite direction
legolas takes aim at the distant target and fells a warg rider
he draws another arrow and kills another
just as he reaches for a third arrow he sees theoden and company approaching
he quickly runs and mounts arod with a smooth leap and joins in the fray with gimli behind him on horseback
the rohirrim and warg riders crash head on and the battle begins
theoden and company hack away at the warg riders
in the midst of fighting gimli falls off arod
he turns to find a warg growling at him
bring your pretty face to my axe
just as the warg leaps at gimli legolas kills it with one shot
jumping back as the warg falls outraged argh
that one counts as mine
as gimli swings his axe at another warg it dies and falls onto gimli pinning him under
as he tries to lift the warg off him an orc leans over them both
gimli kills him quickly twisting his neck and it lands on him also
gimli sniffs at the orc and makes a face
he tries to lift both the warg and orc off him
just then another warg comes upon him and bares its teeth ready to strike
eyes widening ooh
aragorn plucks a spear as he passes on horseback and throws it at the warg
it dies landing on gimli and adding to the pile on top of him
as the warg lands on him oooh
theoden stabs at a warg rider
aragorn is knocked off hasufel and attacked by sharku
aragorn tries to kill the warg rider but sharku blocks his attempt and grabs aragorn by the neck while the latter is half dragged by the warg
in the struggle sharku is thrown off and he rips the evenstar pendant from aragorns neck as he falls
aragorn tries to let go of the warg but finds his wrist tangled with the saddle straps
he tries unsuccessfully to disentangle himself and is dragged closer and closer to the edge of a cliff at great speed
the warg runs right off the cliff and they both disappear over the edge
the battle is winding down as the rohirrim finish off the last few wargs and orcs
looking around aragorn
they come near to the cliff and hear sharku wheezing and laughing standing over the dying orc tell me what happened and i will ease your passing
hes cough dead
laughs evilly took a little tumble off the cliff
looks towards the edge of the cliff and grabs sharku you lie
sharku chortles and dies
legolas looks down at sharkus fist and finds the evenstar pendant
he takes it runs to the edge of the cliff and looks down to see the great drop and rushing waters below with no sign of aragorn
gimli comes to stand beside him
to his men get the wounded on horses
the wolves of isengard will return
leave the dead
legolas turns to theoden an expression of perplexed anger on his face
puts a hand on legolas shoulder come
he leaves legolas and gimli to stare down at the river
the rohan villagers are drawing close to helms deep
cries of relief are heard as the refuge is within sight
there it is
to eowyn were safe my lady
eowyn embraces the woman and they walk on towards helms deep
the gate is opened for the villagers
many have already taken refuge within and are resting along the passage
eothain and freda run towards their mother
the three hug and cry with joy
theoden and company returns from the battle with warg riders make way for theoden
make way for the king
eowyn rushes down to meet them looking about so few
so few of you have returned
dismounting our people are safe
we have paid for it with many lives
going up to eowyn my lady
lord aragorn where is he
eowyn is shaken and raises teary eyes to theoden
the latter looks down and then walks away confirming her unasked question
at the battlements draw all our forces behind the wall
bar the gate and set a watch on the surround
what of those who cannot fight my lord
the women and children
get them into the caves
walks down the steps and past a sewer gate sarumans arm would have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here
camera zooms in on the gate helms deep has one weakness
its outer wall is solid rock but for a small culvert at its base which is little more than a drain
camera turns to grima and saruman at orthanc
saruman is pouring some dark dry substances into a vessel
grima is holding a lit candle in his hand
how can fire undo stone
what kind of device could bring down the wall
as he steps closer to the vessel saruman takes hold of grimas hand and pushes the candle away from the vessel firmly
if the wall is breached helms deep will fall
he walks away towards the balcony
following saruman even if it is breached it would take a number beyond reckoning thousands to storm the keep
tens of thousands
but my lord there is no such force
both of them came onto the balcony of the tower
grima suddenly sees and hears the enormous armies laid out below in neat rows and is astounded and awed
he continues to hold the extinguished candle aloft as he gapes at the vast army below
a horn is sounded announcing the appearance of saruman
a loud cheer is heard from the army
saruman raises a hand
a new power is rising
its victory is at hand
the army cheers and roars
this night the land will be stained with the blood of rohan
march to helms deep
leave none alive
the camera keeps zooming out from the balcony over the incredible size of sarumans army past uruk hai spears and banners and yet more uruk hai
the camera focuses back on saruman who then raises his hands in the air to war
the army cheers and roars even louder
sneers there will be no dawn for men
a tear flows down grimas cheek
the uruk hai army began their march to helms deep
merry and pippin are travelling through the forest carried by treebeard
theres smoke to the south
there is always smoke rising from isengard these days
the two hobbits climb higher up onto treebeard for a better view
there was a time when saruman would walk in my woods
but now he has a mind of metal and wheels
he no longer cares for growing things
pippin and merry are now on top of treebeard and they see a massive army moving across the land what is it
its sarumans army
the war has started
aragorn is floating in the river unconscious
he is washed ashore and dreams of arwen
kissing him on the lips may the grace of the valar protect you
a horse arrives and nudges aragorn turning him over and nuzzling him
he grabs hold of bregos mane pulls himself onto the horse and rides slowly to helms deep
arwen is lying on her bed deep in thought
coming into her room arwen
arwen hears him and sits up
tollen i lu
i chair gwannar na valannor
si bado no cirar
arwen it is time
the ships are leaving for valinor
before it is too late
i have made my choice
he is not coming back
why do you linger here when there is no hope
there is still hope
walks towards window and looks out if aragorn survives this war you will still be parted
if sauron is defeated and aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality
whether by the sword or the slow decay of time aragorn will die
arwen sees a vision of her future as elrond speaks
she is dressed as a queen in mourning garb and looking down upon aragorn a crown on his brow anduril in his hand and dead
mourners are walking around the altar paying their final respects
arwen is weeping
and there will be no comfort for you
no comfort to ease the pain of his passing
he will come to death an image of the splendor of the kings of men in glory undimmed before the breaking of the world
the body of aragorn is now cast as a monument in stone
arwen stands before the monument veiled and in black
but you my daughter you will linger on in darkness and in doubt
as nightfall in winter that comes without a star
here you will dwell bound to your grief under the fading trees until all the world is changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent
still veiled in black arwen is walking alone through the deserted woods of lothlorien
tuning to arwen arwen
there is nothing for you here only death
the vision ends and arwen weeps with sadness and fear
elrond comes to sit beside his daughter and raises a hand to her cheek
a im u erin veleth lin
do i not also have your love
crying and moving into her fathers embrace gerich meleth nin ada
you have my love father elves cloaked and carrying a lantern each are setting off from rivendell on their journey to the west
elrond looks on as arwen leaves with them
arwen turns back to look at her father one last time before she departs
elrond continues to stare after her with an expression of resigned sadness
elrond is standing by a window
he hears galadriel speaking
i amar prestar aen
han mathon ne nen han mathon ne chae a han nostan ned gwilith
the world has changed
i feel it in the water i feel it in the earth i smell it in the air
the power of the enemy is growing
saruman is communicating with sauron via the palantir
sauron will use his puppet saruman to destroy the people of rohan
isengard has been unleashed
view of sarumans marching army the eye of sauron now turns to gondor the last free kingdom of men
view of osgiliath his war on this country will come swiftly
he senses the ring is close
the strength of the ringbearer is failing
in his heart frodo begins to understand
close up of galadriel the quest will claim his life
you know this
you have foreseen it
it is the risk we all took
close up of the ring spinning in slow motion in the gathering dark the will of the ring grows strong
it works hard now to find its way back into the hands of men
we see faramir and gondorian rangers with the captured frodo and sam
men who are so easily seduced by its power
the young captain of gondor has but to extend his hands take the ring for his own and the world will fall
it is close now so close to achieving its goal
faramir and company have reached henneth annun
frodo and sam and being carries blinded folded into the cave
for sauron will have dominion of all life on this earth even unto the ending of the world
the time of the elves is over
close up of galadriels luminous eyes with their deep pools of wisdom
we then see elrond in his library looking at the painting of isildur facing down sauron with the broken blade of narsil
do we leave middle earth to its fate
do we let them stand alone
scene returns to henneth annun
faramir is conferring with his man
they unroll a map
our scouts report saruman has attacked rohan
theodens people have fled to helms deep
points at the map but we must look to our own borders
faramir orcs are on the move
sauron is marshalling an army
easterlings and southrons are passing through the black gate
more come every day
whos covering the river to the north
we pulled men at osgiliath but if the city is attacked we wont hold it
tracing on the map saruman attacks from isengard
sauron from mordor
the fight will come to men on both fronts
gondor is weak
sauron will strike us soon
and he will strike hard
he knows now we do not have the strength to repel him
the hobbits are unbound and blindfolds taken off them by damrod and another ranger
sam and frodo find themselves in a cave behind a waterfall with damrod sitting behind them on a rock constantly watching them
faramir comes up to them and sits
my men tell me that you are orc spies
now wait just a minute
well if youre not spies then who are you
frodo and sam remain silent
we are hobbits of the shire
frodo baggins is my name and this is samwise gamgee
and where is your skulking friend
that gangrel creature
he had an ill favoured look
the merest hesitation
there was no other
sam looks shifty eyed and uncomfortable
we set out from rivendell with seven companions
one we lost in moria
two were my kin
a dwarf there was also and an elf
and two men aragorn son of arathorn and boromir of gondor
intently youre a friend of boromir
for my part
it will grieve you then to learn that he is dead
as one of his companions id hoped you would tell me
pause he was my brother
faramir is sitting alone deep in thought
suddenly someone comes up to him
whispers we found the third one
frodo and sam are sleeping
frodo awakens as faramir stands before him
you must come with me
frodo gets up and follow
they come to the edge of the waterfall overlooking the forbidden pool
pointing down down there
frodo looks down and sees gollum diving into the water
to enter the forbidden pool bears the penalty of death
he gestures to archers hidden in the bushes
they wait for my command
the rangers notch their arrows shall i shoot
frodo looks stricken
gollum emerges from the pool onto a rock
he holds a fish in his hand and starts singing slapping the fish on the rock as he goes
singing the rock and pool is nice and cool so juicy sweet
i only wish whacks the fish on the rock to catch a fish whacks so juicy sweet
the fish almost wriggles out of his grasp and he whacks it some more
faramir has his hand raised to order his men to shoot
at the last moment frodo calls out
faramir stops this creature is bound to me
and i to him
he is our guide
please let me go down to him
frodo descends to the forbidden pool and approaches gollum who is gorging on the raw fish
gollum turns round at frodos voice
master is here
frodo gestures for gollum to follow him
we must go now
smeagol you must trust master
follow me come on
with the fish between his teeth gollum follows frodo warily
suddenly he looks up in alarm and is caught by rangers
dont hurt him
smeagol dont struggle
smeagol listen to me
a black cloth is brought over gollums head
frodo stares after them with a stricken expression as faramir leads gollum and his men away
back in the cave gollum is thrown down to the ground
crying he crawls into a corner and curls up into ball
where are you leading them
cooing his hand stroking his shoulder smea
why does it cry smeagol
sobbing cruel men hurts us
master trickst us
of course he did
i told you he was tricksy
i told you he was false
sobbing master is our friend
master betrayed us
no not its business
leave us alone
hits his fist against the wall filthy little hobbitses
they stole it from us
what did they steal
turns to faramir with a ferocious expression myyy
he bares his teeth and growls aaaarrrggghhh
back in their holding area sam and frodo are alone
we have to get out of here
you can do it
use the ring mr
just this once
put it on
you were right sam
you tried to tell me but
the rings taking me sam
if i put it on hell find me
they both stand as faramir enters
unsheathes his sword so
this is the answer to all the riddles
here in the wild i have you
two halflings and a host of men at my call
the ring of power within my grasp
faramir lifts the ring from frodos neck with the tip of his sword
a chance for faramir captain of gondor to show his quality
frodo is backed up fearfully against the wall
the ring whispers and frodo falls into a trance
suddenly he grabs the ring in his hand and jerks himself away
he runs away from faramir stop it
leave him alone
dont you understand
hes got to destroy it
thats where were going
to the mountain of fire
faramir stares at frodo
just then damrod enters
osgiliath is under attack
they call for reinforcements
its such a burden
will you not help him
prepare to leave
the ring will go to gondor
he turns to leave
sam looks after faramir sadly
aragorn is riding towards helms deep
on the way he sees an enormous uruk hai army marching with great speed
he quickly makes haste towards helms deep and soon sees the refuge
patting brego on the neck mae carnen brego mellon nin
well done brego my friend he rides into helms deep to the amazement of all
pushing his way through the crowd
where is he
where is he
get out of the way
im gonna kill him
he sees aragorn
you are the luckiest the canniest and the most reckless man i ever knew
he hugs aragorn
bless you laddie
gimli where is the king
gimli gestures to the hall
as aragorn makes his way in he runs into legolas who stands waiting
le ab dollen
legolas pauses and looks at aragorns wounds
you look terrible
to the side eowyn sees aragorn and smiles joyously and with relief
legolas takes aragorns hand and gives the evenstar pendant
aragorn looks at the evenstar and claps legolas on the shoulder
eowyn looks on and smiles even as tears fill her eyes
aragorn is in the keep conferring with theoden a great host you say
all isengard is emptied how many
ten thousand strong at least
it is an army bred for a single purpose to destroy the world of men
they will be here by nightfall
let them come
walks away resolutely along the passage behind the deeping wall
to gamling i want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall
gamling nods and goes off
theoden stands at the gate of helms deep speaking to aragorn legolas and gimli
we will cover the causeway and the gate from above
no army has ever breached the deeping wall or set foot inside the hornburg
this is no rabble of mindless orcs
these are uruk hai
their armor is thick and their shields broad
i have fought many wars master dwarf
i know how to defend my own keep
gimli seems miffed
legolas claps a hand on gimlis shoulder as he follows aragorn and theoden back in
they will break upon this fortress like water on rock
sarumans hordes will pillage and burn weve seen it before
crops can be resown homes rebuilt
within these walls we will outlast them
they do not come to destroy rohans crops or villages
they come to destroy its people
down to the last child
draws close to aragorn what would you have me do
look at my men
their courage hangs by a thread
if this is to be our end then i would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance
send out riders my lord
you must call for aid
and who will come
we are not so lucky in our friends as you
the old alliances are dead
gondor will answer
where was gondor when the westfold fell
where was gondor when our enemies closed in around us
where was gon
no my lord aragorn we are alone
he walks away calling out orders get the women and children into the caves
we need more time to lay provisions for a siege lord cutting him off there is no time
war is upon us
to the soldiers secure the gate
men rush to prepare for battle as flocks of carrion crows circle overhead
treebeard walks through the forest carrying merry and pippin
he comes to a clearing and stops
we ents have not troubled about the wars of men and wizards for a very long time
but now something is about to happen that has not happened for an age
tis a gathering
a gathering of what
merry and pippin turns round as they hear movement from the forest around them
they see many more ents like treebeard gathering
beech oak chestnut ash
good good good
many have come
now we must decide if the ents will go to war
merry licks his lips in anticipation
back at helms deep the women and children are being led into the caves
move to the caves
old men and young lads are being drafted for war
the women and children say their tearful and reluctant farewells as their fathers husbands and sons are led away by soldiers
in the armoury weapons are being distributed
aragorn picks up a battered sword looks at it and tosses it back
farmer farriers stable boys
these are no soldiers
most have seen too many winters
or too few
look at them
i can see it in their eyes
the men around them fell silent
legolas speaks to aragorn
boe a hun neled herain dan caer menig
and they should be
three hundred against ten thousand
si beriathar hyn
amar na ned edoras
they have more hope of defending themselves here than at edoras
aragorn men i ndagor
natha daged aen
aragorn we are warriors
they cannot win this fight
they are all going to die
then i shall die as one them
he pauses and then walks away
legolas makes as if to go after him
puts a hand on legolas let him go lad
let him be
in the hall every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory
who am i gamling
you are our king sire
and do you trust your king
puts armour onto theoden your men my lord will follow you to whatever end
the villagers are handed their weapons
an oversized helmet is placed on a wide eyed boy
another stares at the axe that he is handed with frightened eyes
another child wearing oversized chain mail takes up a huge shield
theoden stands inside the main hall of the keep his back to the entrance where a bright white light is streaming through
to whatever end
where is the horse and the rider
where is the horn that was blowing
they have passed like rain on the mountains
like wind in the meadow
the days have gone down in the west
behind the hills into shadow
how did it come to this
everyone is getting ready for war at the battlements
aragorn is sitting on the steps
he sees a young lad in armour holding a sword looking around nervously
give me your sword
what is your name
haleth son of hama my lord
the men are saying that we will not live out the night
they say that it is hopeless
aragorn gives the battered sword a few swings
this is a good sword haleth son of hama
he hands the sword back to haleth and leans close to him putting a hand on his shoulder
there is always hope
back at the armoury aragorn dons his battle gear
his sword is handed to him as he reaches for it
he nods and accepts the sword from legolas
we have trusted you this far
you have not led us astray
i was wrong to despair
u moe edhored legolas
there is nothing to forgive legolas
they smile and clap one another on the shoulders
they look at gimli as he walks up to them struggling with his chain mail
if we had more time id get this adjusted
he drops the bundle and the chain mail lands with its length right to the floor
its a little tight across the chest
aragorn and legolas bite back smiles
just then a horn sounds in the background that is no orc horn
they run out to the battlements
the guards look down in wonderment
to another guard send for the king
open the gate
open the gate
an army of lothlorien elves march up the causeway into the hornburg
they are led by haldir
the rohirrim soldiers look upon them in wonderment and delight as they pass
how is this possible
i bring word from elrond of rivendell
an alliance once existed between elves and men
long ago we fought and died together
he looks up to see aragorn legolas and gimli running down the steps and smiles we come to honor that allegiance
he bows mae govannen haldir
welcome haldir he grabs haldir in a huge embrace
initially stunned haldir hugs him back lightly
you are most welcome
legolas and haldir clasp each other on the shoulder
turning to theoden we are proud to fight alongside men once more
men and elves are in their positions on the battlements of helms deep
the sounds of a marching army move closer and closer
the women and children in the caves hear the sounds overhead and are frightened
mothers draw their children close and try to sooth crying babies
the men and elves look out into the darkness lit by the thousands of torches carried by the huge advancing uruk hai army and the light bouncing off their armour
with a row of elf archers gimli is standing beside legolas behind a wall only the top of his helmet visible
grumbling and straining to look above the wall
you could have picked a better spot
aragorn approaches and stands beside them well lad whatever luck you live by lets hope it lasts the night
thunder sounds and lightning flashes revealing the sea of approaching uruk hai
your friends are with you aragorn
lets hope they last the night
the marching and thumping grows louder and louder
lightning flashes and it begins to rain
while the uruk hai army continues to march at the fortress an uruk hai leader steps on a rock outcrop
aragorn is giving commands to the elf warriors
a eruchin u dano i faelas a hyn an uben tanatha le faelas
show them no mercy
for you shall receive none
the uruk hai leader raises his swords and commands his army to stop with a terrifying animalic cry
the uruks stop and growl in anticipation of the upcoming battle and slaughter jumping and straining to see whats happening out there
shall i describe it to you
looks at gimli with a grin or would you like me to find you a box
laughs good naturedly hehehehe
the uruk leader cries out once encouraging the uruk hai to start roaring and thumping their spears furiously
the women and children in the caves huddle together in fear
suddenly aldor the old man next to haleth loses his grip and releases his arrow prematurely shooting an uruk hai in the neck
the uruk hai army stop their roaring and thumping
with a hollow groan the uruk that was shot collapsed to the ground
the other uruk hai bare their teeth and roar with anger
with a cry the uruk hai leader thrusts his weapon in the air and the uruk hai army starts charging
so it begins
prepare to fire
the elves notch their arrow and aim
faeg i varv din na lanc a nu ranc
their armor is weak at the neck and beneath the arms
leithio i philinn
release the arrows
arrows rain down on the uruk hai below killing many
did they hit anything
give them a volley
to the men fire
more arrows are released
but the uruk hai army keep advancing with more replacing those fallen
impatiently send them to me
the uruk hai start to load ladders onto the walls pushing them up with their long spears
the elves draw their blades in preparation for combat
the first ladders are almost reaching the walls with big nasty uruk berserkers on top of them
close combat begins as the uruk hai climb over the wall
legolas two already
holding up two fingers im on seventeen
ill have no pointy ear outscoring me
he turns to a uruk just climbing over the wall whacking it in the groin with his axe and killing it as it falls
fires two arrows nineteen
the ent moot is still in progress
the ents sway a little as they continue to deliberate
merry and pippin are sitting a distance away
suddenly treebeard nods and turns to the hobbits
we have just agreed
long pause with his eyes closed
angles his head in query yes
i have told your names to the ent moot and we have agreed you are not orcs
well thats good news
impatiently and what about saruman
have you come to a decision about him
waving a hand now dont be hasty master meriadoc
our friends are out there
they need our help
they cannot fight this war on their own
it affects us all
but you must understand young hobbit
it takes a loong time to say anything in ooold
merry and pippin roll their eyes in disgruntlement
and we never say anything
unless it is worth taking a looong
time to say
gimli is standing on the wall between two ladders hacking away at uruk hai as they come up seventeen
camera pans over the uruk hai below and turns to the causeway
a group of uruk hai is advancing on the causeway towards the gate in tortoise formation using their broad shields to block off attacks
directs the elf archers to aim at the uruk hai column
the elf archers release their arrows
the uruk hai at the sides are shot and fall down the causeway
but the column keeps advancing
is this it
is this all you can conjure saruman
at the bottom of the deeping wall two spiky bombs are lodge in the sluice gate
the rest opens a path and an uruk hai carrying a torch starts to run towards the sluice gate
aragorn spots the uruk hai
togo hon dad legolas
bring him down legolas
legolas shoots the uruk hai in the shoulder but the latter keeps going dago hon
legolas shoots the uruk again
it stumbles and then throws it self and the torch at the bombs
an enormous explosion is set off blowing away a large part of the wall
rock debris and bodies are thrown up
aragorn is also thrown back by the force of the explosion and on the ground knocked out
theoden looks on in shock as the uruk hai streams in past the deeping walls
brace the gate
gimli sees the uruk hai charging in with aragorn in their path
with a cry he jumps down from the wall and lands on the uruk hai army taking them out as he stands
he is soon overpowered
aragorn gets up and sees gimli falling
he yells to the elves behind him hado i philinn
hurl the arrows
the arrows take out the first group of uruk hai coming through the hole in the wall
aragorn leads the elves in a charge towards the uruk hai streaming in
he rushes to gimlis side and picks him up
at the top of the battlements legolas grabs a shield and sends it sliding across the ground
he then hops onto it and surfs down the steps releasing three arrows as he goes and kicking the shield to stab an uruk hai as he lands at the
at the ent moot the ents cannot hold back this storm
we must weather such things as we have always done
how can that be your decision
this is not our war
but youre part of this world
the ents look at one another taken back you must help please
you must do something
you are young and brave master merry
but your part in this tale is over
go back to your home
merry is putting on his jacket
pippin approaches him slowly maybe treebeards right
we dont belong here merry
its too big for us
what can we do in the end
weve got the shire
maybe we should go home
looking into the distance
the fires of isengard will spread
and the woods of tuckborough and buckland will burn
and all that was once green and good in this world will be gone
turns to pippin and puts a hand on his shoulder there wont be a shire pippin
pippin looks after merry as he walks away
fall back to the keep
get your men out of there
haldir na barad
to the keep
pull back to the keep
haldir to the keep
haldir nods and turns back
gimli is being carried away kicking and struggling as he goes protesting what are you doing
what are you stopping for
with a grimace he kills the uruk hai and looks down as his wound in seeming disbelief
an uruk hai comes up from behind him unnoticed and slices him on the neck
as haldir goes down he looks around him and sees his kin fallen among dead uruk hai
sees haldir falling haldir
he runs up the steps to haldirs side and catches him and he collapses
haldirs head rolls back his eyes empty and unseeing
aragorn bows his head in grief
then with a cry he jumps onto a ladder and swings down to the ground killing as he goes
brace the gate
drawing his sword to the gate
draw your swords
theoden and his commanders come to the gate which is under heavy attack
the uruk hai are knocking down the gate and hacking through the broken wood
theoden stabs at an uruk hai and receives a lance in his shoulder blocked by his armour
grimacing in pain theoden continues to stab at the uruk until led away by gamling
we cannot hold much longer
runs up and stabs away at the uruk hai through the broken gate how long do you need
brace the gate
as long as you can give me
brace the gate
aragorn and gimli slip out a side exit and stand on a ledge just to the side of the main gate
aragorn peeks over seeing the large band of uruk hai storming the gate
we can take em
its a long way
gimli takes a peek and then steps back
mumbles toss me
i cannot jump the distance
youll have to toss me
aragorn nods slowly and then turns to grab the dwarf
gimli stays aragorns hand dont tell the elf
not a word
he tosses gimli to the head of the causeway and then leaps over
making quick work of killing the uruk hai on the other side of the gate shore up the door
follow me to the barricade
watch our backs
throw another one over here
men are bracing the gate with wood and nails
aragorn and gimli continue to fight off the uruk hai just outside
meanwhile the uruk hai load and fires enormous hooks over the battlements
hundred of uruk hai climb onto super ladders as they are pulled up towards the walls the super ladders locking onto the edge of the battlements with their steel grips
legolas takes aim as another super ladder is being pulled up and shoots away one of the ropes
the ladder falls back onto the uruk hai army
hold fast the gate
through a crack in the gate gimli
get out of there
legolas calls to them from the top of the battlements aragorn
he throws them a rope aragorn grabs gimli in one hand and the rope with the other as they are pulled up the wall
just then the uruk hai load and fires enormous hooks over the battlements
hundred of uruk hai climb onto super ladders as they are pulled up towards the walls the super ladders locking onto the edge of the battlements with their steel grips
legolas takes aim as another super ladder is being pulled up and shoots away one of the ropes
the ladder falls back onto the uruk hai army
pull everybody back
pull them back
theyve broken through
the castle is breached
get them inside
into the keep
they all run towards the keep legolas firing two arrows into the uruk hai army as he goes
treebeard is walking through the forest carrying merry and pippin
the hobbits look dejected
i will leave you at the western borders of the forest
you can make your way north to your homeland from there
pippin suddenly looks up with a gleam in his eyes
treebeard comes to a stop
take us south
but that will lead you past isengard
if we go south we can slip past saruman unnoticed
the closer we are to danger the farther we are from harm
its the last thing hell expect
that doesnt make sense to me
but then you are very small
perhaps youre right
south it is then
hold on little shirelings
i always like going south
somehow it feels like going down hill
are you mad
well be caught
no we wont
not this time
faramir and company draws close to osgiliath
mordor has come
with tears in his eyes the ring will not save gondor
it has only the power to destroy
please let me go
faramir hesitates for a moment
he presses them on faramir you must let me go
frodo and sam are pushed on towards osgiliath treebeard merry and pippin come to the southern edge of the forest
and a little family of field mice that climb up sometimes and they tickle me awfully
theyre always trying to get somewhere where they oh
he sees the desolated landscape of tree stumps that used to be forested grounds many of these trees were my friends
creatures i had known from nut and acorn
im sorry treebeard
with tears in his eyes they had voices of their own
his gaze turns to the treeless isengard and its smoking caverns saruman
a wizard should know better
he lets out a ferocious roar that echoes through the forest there is no curse in elvish entish or the tongues of men for this treachery
my business is with isengard tonight
with rock and stone
merry and pippin turn around as they hear rumbles from the forest
they see many ents emerging and marching towards them yes
come my friends
the ents are going to war
it is likely that we go to our doom
last march of the ents
osgiliath is still under siege as faramir and company arrives dodging arrows and falling rocks
faramir orcs have taken the eastern shore
their numbers are too great
by nightfall well be overrun
frodo suddenly seems stricken mr frodo
its calling to him sam
his eye is almost on me
hold on mr
youll be alright
frodo sees that sam is speaking to him but he hears nothing
his senses are overcome
take them to my father
tell him faramir sends a mighty gift
a weapon that will change our fortunes in this war
sam breaks away as they are being led away
do you want to know what happened to boromir
you want to know why your brother died
he tried to take the ring from frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him he tried to kill him
the ring drove your brother mad
a boulder crashes into a tower overhead and shatters it
suddenly frodos eyes roll up and he stares at faramir strangely
in a faraway voice theyre here
looking up nazgul
he grabs the hobbits and thrusts them into a corner
keep out of sight
to his men take cover
banners of the white hand are flying from the battlements of helms deep
the hornburg is overrun with uruk hai
theoden and company are in the hall of the keep
the fortress is taken
it is over
carrying a table with legolas to shore up the door of the hall you said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it
they still defend it
they have died defending it
in the glittering caves the women and children cry in fear as they hear the battering ram banging on the door
they are breaking in
is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves
there is no answer
is there no other way
there is one passage
it leads into the mountains
but they will not get far
the uruk hai are too many
send word for the women and children to make for the mountain pass
and barricade the entrance
so much death
what can men do against such reckless hate
pause ride out with me
ride out and meet them
a light of determination shines in his eyes for death and glory
for your people
the sun is rising
aragorn looks up at a window to see faint light streaming through
he recalls gandalfs words
look to my coming at first light on the fifth day
at dawn look to the east
the horn of helm hammerhand shall sound in the deep one last time
gimli runs up the steps to the horn of helm hammerhand let this be the hour when we draw swords together
fell deeds awake
now for wrath
now for ruin
and a red dawn
he mounts his horse and puts on his helmet
the sound of the horn rumbles through helms deep as gimli blows with gusto
theoden leads the charge out of the keep into the hornburg slashing away at the uruk hai as they go
without pause they storm out of the gate and down the causeway right into the column of waiting uruk hai
in the midst of battle aragorn looks east and sees a white rider against the rising sun gandalf
theoden king stands alone
coming up from behind not alone
he raises a hand rohirrim
riders move up behind eomer
looking to the east eomer
to the king
the rohirrim and the white rider charge down the slope
half the uruk hai army turns to face the challenge bearing their spears down towards the riders
as the riders draw closer the sun rises behind them momentarily blinding the uruk hai who raise the hands and spears to shield their eyes
the riders crash right into the uruk hai and engage them in battle
the ents are stomping over isengard swinging their huge limbs throwing and stamping on orcs and rolling huge boulders over the ground
an ent is pulled down with chains by some orcs who immediately jump on and hacks away at his wooden limbs
saruman rushes out onto the balcony of orthanc and stares at the pandemonium in incredulity
merry and pippin also throws stones at orcs their aims true
a fine hit
two ents rock a wooden structure and push it over into the caverns below smashing against the rock
some orcs fire flamed tipped arrows at an ent setting him on fire
saruman continues to look about from his balcony helpless
some ents are now breaking away at a dam
break the dam
release the river
the dam is broken and saruman looks up to see the river rushing down the slope towards isengard washing away orcs and wooden structures in its path
pippin hold on
the hobbits tighten their hold on top of treebeard hold on little hobbits
treebeard braces himself against the flood
as the water rushes over isengard an ent rushes in and thrusts his burning body into the water
the water rushes into the caverns washing away the bridges mechanisms and structures within
frodo walks slowly away from the safe corner
gondorian rangers are still running about defending their stations
what are you doing
where are you going
frodo walks up some stairs and stands on a bridge
a nazgul on a fell beast emerges in front of him
frodo stares at the nazgul fixated
feeling the call of the ring he holds it up
faramir watches the unfolding tableau from below
as frodo moves to put the ring on his finger and the nazgul flies closer and closer sam runs up and knocks frodo over
faramir releases an arrow and shoots the fell beast
frodo and sam roll down the stairs
as they come to a stop at the bottom frodo holds sam in a death grip yells and points sting at his throat his eyes livid with madness and anger
that someone would try to take the ring away
with tears running down his face its me
its your sam
dont you know your sam
the madness fades and recognition returns to frodos eyes
he realises what he nearly did and is overcome
stumbling backwards he collapses against a wall and sting falls to the ground with a clang
sam gets up slowly
slowly and with despair i cant do this sam
getting up slowly i know
its all wrong
by rights we shouldnt even be here
but we are
he stands and leans against a wall looking out into the distance
its like in the great stories mr
the ones that really mattered
full of darkness and danger they were
and sometimes you didnt want to know the end
because how could the end be happy
images of the riders winning the battle against the uruk hai at helms deep how could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had
we have victory
he raises his sword with a victorious cry but in the end its only a passing thing this shadow
the women and children welcome the men as they return
eowyn runs up to aragorn and embraces him crying tears of relief
even darkness must pass
a new day will come
isengard is flooded
merry and pippin looks on from their perch on treebeard
on the balcony saruman stumbles back into his chamber and when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer
those were the stories that stayed with you
that meant something even if you were too small to understand why
but i think mr
frodo i do understand
i know now
folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didnt
they kept going because they were holding on to something
what are we holding on to sam
theres some good in this world mr
and its worth fighting for
standing in a corner even gollum seems moved
faramir walks over and comes to kneel in front of frodo i think at last we understand one another frodo baggins
you know the laws of our country the laws of your father
if you let them go your life will be forfeit
then it is forfeit
sam shakes the rangers hand from his shoulder
frodo looks up at faramir with gladness
over in the realm of rohan gandalf theoden and company ride to the top of a slope looking towards the mountain of fire in the distance
saurons wrath will be terrible his retribution swift
the battle for helms deep is over
the battle for middle earth is about to begin
all our hopes now lie with two little hobbits
somewhere in the wilderness
frodo and sam are walking through the woods away from osgiliath
i wonder if well ever be put into songs or tales
i wonder if people will ever say lets hear about frodo and the ring
and theyll say yes thats one of my favorite stories
frodo was really courageous wasnt he dad
yes my boy the most famousest of hobbits
and thats saying alot
huh you left out one of the chief characters samwise the brave
i want to hear more about sam
frodo turns to look at sam
frodo wouldnt have got far without sam
frodo you shouldnt make fun
i was being serious
smiling so was i
he turns to walk on dreamily samwise the brave
he gives his backpack a heave and follows frodo gollum is crouching a short distance away smeagol
were not gonna wait for you
master looks after us
master wouldnt hurt us
master broke his promise
dont ask smeagol
poor poor smeagol
master betrayed us
wicked tricksy false
we ought to wring his filthy little neck
twists the branch of a tree kill him
kill them both
and then we take the precious and we be the master
scuttles and hides behind a tree the fat hobbit he knows
eyes always watching
then we stabs them out
put out his eyeses
and make him crawl
bites on his finger and nods eagerly yes
kill them both
backs away against a tree its too risky its too risky
he looks in the direction of the hobbits wheres he gone
hey gollum where are you
softly and sinisterly we could let her do it
she could do it
yes precious she could
and then we takes it once theyre dead
once theyre dead
he pops out from hiding in front of the hobbits
come on hobbits
long ways to go yet
smeagol will show you the way
he turns to walk on with frodo and sam following behind
camera pans up over the forest and ephel duath to reveal the desolation of mordor
to the left of the frame is the glowing eye of sauron atop barad dur and to the right of the frame is the fiery mount doom
three fell beasts circle the dark skies
lightning flashes as the scene fades to black
