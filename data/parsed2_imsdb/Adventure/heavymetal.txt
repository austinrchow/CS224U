heavy metal by dan goldberg len blum final draft dan goldberg and len blum july a beautiful field of wheat glistens in the morning sun
as the camera skims overtop titles start to roll
ahead of us an odd looking service van comes into view sputtering along a dirt road
getting closer we can see the driver a thin bookish man with a neat mustache
this is austin grimaldi
the truck pulls up to a strange victorian house in the middle of the wheatfield
the house has several futuristic radar devices on the roof that rotate constantly
austin gets out opens the vans rear doors and pulls out two large metal boxes
the curtains part ever so slightly and a pair of eyes peer down
austin shuts the vans rear doors and carries the two metal boxes into the house
the titles stop rolling as we austin is reading a schematic diagram as he sits in front of the exposed chassis of a complicated futuristic electronic contraption twice his size
there are strange tools all over the floor
putting down the diagram he opens one of the metal cases and takes out a sophisticated looking glass sphere with electronic receptacles mounted in the sides
he places this sphere in a space in the middle of the contraption clamps it down and plugs some wires into the globes receptacles
then he opens the second box
inside is a glowing green ball
using a pair of special tongs austin carefully lifts the ball out and inserts it into an opening at the base of the machine in the back
as soon as the ball is inside the machine hums to life
the glass sphere sparkles and a holographic picture of a green planet in space appears inside it
looking at the holograph hmmmm
he takes a strange tool and moves out of frame to make an adjustment underneath the machine
suddenly a wire comes loose from the sphere and begins to spark
seeing sparks uh oh
as the camera pulls closer to the holograph screen the green planet begins to silently shake
with an explosion that rocks the universe a huge chunk rips out of the green planet and shoots off into space leaving thousands of glowing particles in its wake
not noticing the silent image on the holograph he quickly repairs the sparkling connection and returns to his other adjustments
from the forest floor we see the green planetoid fly overhead dropping balls
we watch as it moves away and disappears beyond a far off mountain range
the forest rumbles as the planetoid crashes in the distance
the camera then pans over to a forest patch where a beautiful girl approaches picking mushrooms
an ominous note is struck as the girl notices the glowing ball and is drawn to it
picking the sphere up she looks at it
something inside her warns her of its danger but unable to resist she puts it in her basket and continues on
night falls over this futuristic chromoid city as the beautiful girl passes through the glass gates and heads home
the girl yawns and gets into bed as the camera pans over to her basket in the corner
through its side the green ball begins to glow brightly
getting closer we see a slimy silk like webbing ooze out of the ball and move towards the sleeping girl pulling the green ball behind it
the ball starts to glow and pulse as the webbing begins to surround the girl like a cocoon
slowly the camera pans up the wall and moves out through the window and beyond the city gates rising higher and higher
flying quickly overtop futuristic villages the camera heads further and further out into the less civilized sectors where the rusting pipelines and crumbling utility stations of a past civilization have
been overgrown by scrub bush and weeds
the camera zooms across this strange landscape toward the distant mountains where the huge planetoid fell
finally from high above the foothills we begin to come down
in the hills below us hundreds of blue humanoid barbarians are moving along mesmerized toward a pulsing green glow high in the mountaintops
suddenly the mountains begin to rumble
at the front of the line the largest barbarian obviously their leader stops and points
a strange green foamy liquid comes pouring down the mountains toward the barbarians
the barbarians stand frozen as the foam washes over them and keeps on going
one by one their eyes turn green and they start to change becoming hairier uglier and stronger
as their transformations are complete the barbarians gather behind their leader into an ever growing mob of murderous looking sub humans
a frightened kraanian councillor spurs his horse forward through the beautiful glass gates as in the distance we hear the sound of ten thousand approaching footsteps
the camera pans to a hillside overlooking kraan
in the glow of sunset the outline of the barbarian leader riding a black war horse appears at the hillside and stops
then with a thundering of footsteps the outline of five thousand barbarians comes into view behind him filling the horizon
he is now wearing a strange medallion around his neck as wild eyed he screams to signal the attack
the bloodthirsty horde charges down the hill behind him
the camera moves with the barbarians as they crash through the gates of the city destroying everything in their path
smoke and flames are everywhere
ahead of us terrified kraanians run from the onslaught
as we track up over the burning rooftops we see the barbarian leader riding his war horse in the streets below
shouting a command he waves his men on as they move toward an impressive doomed building in the middle of the city
at the far end of this huge glass hall the kraanian council sits around a marble table
from outside we hear the battle raging
pulling closer we can hear the worried voices of the council members
theyre killing everyone
we must escape
the city is burning
throwing a parchment before the elder even the mountains glow green and an evil slime oozes down
elder we must arm ourselves
we must fight silence
everyone gets quiet
looking at the parchment thrown before him the ancient withered elder rises to his feet
we are not a race of warriors
we are statesmen and scientists
from our very beginning it was ordained that the warrior race of taarak the defender would aid us in times of need
this was the pact taarak the defender
his race is dead they cannot defend anyone
some say that the race is not dead that one still lives
what good is one one of taaraks blood can do much
outside the sounds of battle grow louder
a boy appears at the doorway
they are at the walls
well who is this last defender
how can he be summoned
it is taarna of the blood of taarak the defender the last of the race
and must be summoned as my forefathers summoned taarak himself from within but will this defender answer
a taarakian has no choice
they must answer
it is in their blood
the clattering of armour becomes audible
they are in the halls
they are coming
calmly to the boy bar the door
to the councilmen we will summon the defender together
the councilmen nod
shutting eyes taarna
as the councilmen take up the chant as the boy begins to bar the door it bursts open flinging him aside
standing in the doorway surrounded by his men is the barbarian leader
with a laugh he raises a medieval looking multiple cross bow and fires a burst of arrows into the boys chest as the crazed troops rush in around him
the chanting continues as we we look down over this uncivilized wilderness with only decaying pipelines and the occasional jagged rock structure breaking the barren uniformity of the land
as the councils distant chanting fades out all is quiet
suddenly from behind us we hear the sound of flapping wings and a huge rush of air
just above our heads taarna the defender comes flying in sitting proudly in the saddle of a giant crimson bird
she is beautiful with dark eyes and wild red hair blowing behind her in the wind
below her on the ground she sees a humanoid running in terror chased by an ugly four legged mutant creature
spurring her bird forward taarna sweeps down over the ugly beast and lassoes it
she then hoists the creature up into the air and tossing her end of the rope over a tall jagged rock she leaves the snarling beast hanging helplessly
flying down to the grateful humanoid she dismounts
as she approaches we see that he has a barbarian medallion on a chain around his neck
i owe you my life
let me repay you
he takes off his medallion and places it around her neck
suddenly he twists the chain tight in his hand pulling her towards him
his eyes change to a bright green as he forces her to the ground and starts ripping at her clothes
as he molests her taarna is distracted
she hears something voices inside her chanting her name
quickly she grabs the chain and rips it apart
then she powerfully smashes both her hands together around her attackers ears
as he holds his ringing ears she gets up lifts him above her head and hurls him mercilessly to the ground
still hearing the chanting she jumps on her bird pulls out a second rope and lassoes the barbarians feet
she then lifts him up and leaves him hanging from the tall jagged rock next to the growling creature
as taarna flies off the hanging beast eyes the barbarian hungrily
he is still sitting on the floor working on his machine
as the camera pulls closer we see that austin is reaching deep inside the machineworks trying to solder a small orange diode in place with an odd style soldering iron
the connection breaks and the diode and some hot solder fall deeper into the machine and start smoking and sputtering
as the smoke grows thicker the machine starts to buzz loudly
austin pulls his face out of the smoking chassis grabs a pair of needlenose pliers and reaches back to retrieve the part
the camera follows austins arm into the chassis where smoke surrounds it and clouds over everything
the buzzing sound grows and changes into the sound of powerful throbbing engines
slowly the smoke begins to clear as we hear a voice crackling over a radiophone
where the hell are we
suddenly the smoke dissipates and a formation of b bombers come tearing out into the moonlit night
the sound of jungle night creatures fills the air
we see palm trees silhouetted against the moon bright sky
the scene is almost serene
the camera pans and suddenly the nose of a large parked bomber fills the screen and as the camera continues panning we pass a large red rising sun on the
the pan stops at the tail of the aircraft and we see a japanese soldier a guard
there is a moment of tranquillity as jungle sounds fill the air
the soldier almost dozes
suddenly the cacophony of sound stops and for a brief moment there is complete silence then with an agonizing wail an air raid siren shatters the silence and the guard
looks skyward startled
instantly all hell breaks loose as we hear pounding feet
silhouetted figures rush by
japanese soldiers crank the barrel of an anti aircraft gun skyward
we begin to hear the sound of approaching engines
it is thrust into a breech
as the bombers press on the camera moves in to the lead aircraft
in the moonlight we see her name pacific pearl
were there stepek right on target
rabual dead ahead
suddenly a cacophony of explosions split the air as anti aircraft shells explode ahead of the aircraft lighting the inside with electric blue flashes
thanks for telling me holden
i thought it was cleveland
ackack guns blast shells skyward
the gun blasts light up the palm tree background causing momentary silhouettes
for christ sake hold her steady
he can be seen from outside the plane as the shell flashes light up his turret
quit yer bitching stepek just drop em and lets get outta here
keep your shirts on guys tonight im gonna hit something
he settles over the bomb sight left two degrees
the flak is severe with electric blue flashes lighting up the fuselage interior
hey kid how ya doing back there
tailgunner momentarily lit with a shell burst hes scared shitless
he looks nervously back behind the aircraft at the flak puffs behind the tail
okay i think
button it up were almost there
he is crouched over his bomb sights concentrating
cmon stepek theres the whole island of rabaul down there you cant miss
suddenly a shell explodes almost on the windshield and the pilot rears back with the blast
the right windshield is shattered
we took a hit
the co pilot sags forward held back only by his shoulder straps
his eyes stare
blood runs from under his helmet
we know he is dead
elkhorn just bought it
we took one back here too
cmon stepek blast em
hand on the release button steady
lets get the hell outta here
we hear the shriek of descending bombs
the explosions walk across the airfield and in the light of the explosions we see devastation
the last bomb hits a fuel dump causing an enormous ball of fire
exhilarated nice shooting stepek how are the rest of you guys
flight engineer okay
there is abrupt silence
still silence no reply from either name
kid check the waist positions see if theyre okay
will do skipper
tailgunner crosses himself then exits back into the body of the machine
wearily lets go home
we hear jumbled comments from all positions
everyone is happy
cheers and whoops
the mood of high spirits is stopped abruptly as the tailgunner reports back
skipper bellson and lewis are both dead
this is the first time the kids voice is not scared just puzzled
well kid now you got a real bombing mission under your belt
he removes his oxygen mask and takes a long swig from a bottle
she rejoins the rest of the group
the formation is not quite as tight as before
as the formation flies along puffs of cloud pass by occasionally obscuring a machine
under the pacific pearls belly we see the bellygunner suspended in his small glass pod
a red glow brightens up as he drags on a cigar
the rest of the formation are visible stretched to the side and behind as puffs of cloud waft past
we begin to feel as if the weather might be changing
the bombardier is relaxing inside as he swigs from the bottle and sings raucously
from the front we look in on the pilot with the dead co pilot sagging in his seat next to him
sorry about elkhorn skip
the shell exploded and he collapsed
i think he took it in the head
are ya sure hes dead skipper
sings drunkenly oh i put my finger in a woodpeckers hole and the woodpecker said god bless my soul take it out take it out take it out remove it
bolder hey stepek just shut up okay
up yours kid wassa matter you dont like my voice
while all this banter has been going on the cloud has been thickening
suddenly a serious voice cuts in on the small talk
its the navigator
he is frantically tapping the compass
you got a problem holden
naw the kids the one with the problem
he dont like my voice
button it up stepek
whats the problem holden
i must have a malfunction my compass says were heading north
he looks at his compass
mine says east
hey can you guys see the rest of the squadron
negative theres too much cloud
a sudden flash of lightning illuminates the whole inside of the plane
the dead co pilots pale face is momentarily electric blue lit by the lightning flash
we pan past him to the compass in the instrument panel
it is spinning madly
what the hell
he reaches forward to tap the compass
hey holden now my compass has gone crazy
its spinning like a son of a bitch
mine too we must have hit a magnetic field or something
we see a dull glow coming from all crew positions from the on board lights
suddenly a curtain of rain lashes the machine
christ now theyre all doing it
all the dials are going haywire
above the instrument panel we see the windshield is spattered with rain
you guys quit talking business
im trying to sing here
oh i put my finger in a woodpeckers
irritably can it stepek we got real problems
just then through the rain a strange green glow is seen in the distance
it begins to curve toward the aircraft
the turret swings as the gunner spots the glow
look at that
from under the starboard wing we see the object approaching
look at what
look at what
its out there just look at it
for christ sake give us a position
its about four oclock just below holy shit its coming right at us
the glow suddenly zooms at the plane with great speed and hits the starboard inner engine
he has to push the dead co pilot back to peer out the broken starboard window
the number three prop is bent and windmilling wildly
it has a strange green luminescence about it
the whole machine shakes
the pilot tries to fly the plane and do the co pilots job of feathering the bad engine
suddenly its too late as the prop wobbles loose and cartwheels over the wing
the prop flies back and slices a great gash in the aircrafts skin near the tailgunners position
we lost the goddamned prop
did it do any damage
kid check the tail
come in kid
kid are you okay
travis go check the back
will do skipper
travis turret opens and travis pulls himself up into the fuselage
the gauges are now settled except for the oil pressure to no
the pressure drops
the engine heat gauge climbs rapidly
a red warning light begins to flash
to himself goddamn it now what
he glances out of his window just in time to see a strange claw like feeler coming out of the engine casing
it detaches one of the cooling gills then another and another
they blow away in the slipstream
rubbing his eyes jesus i must be getting tired
he looks in to the kids reargun compartment
all that is left of him is a tattered skeleton
travis turns horror frozen on his face
quick as a flash from seemingly nowhere something flies at him and grabs his throat
the mask on his face falls off and we get a split second look of abject horror as he falls out of frame
travis whats goin on back there
his eyes are open but he is obviously dead
through his helmet headphone we hear his name
holden how far to base
skip with everything screwed up here id id guess about two hundred miles
all the time the engine pops and bangs wildly
for christs sake find us a place i can put her down
its all ocean down there skip
mack can you get us a radio fix
negative skip too much interference
he is fighting the controls
ive gotta put her down
ya old stuff shirt
ya wanna snort
for god sakes stepek shut up
stepek takes another swig from his bottle
he is lying on his back partly propped up by the curving nose of the aircraft
he is about to make another smart ass reply when he hears a strange scratching and chirping noise above his head
he looks up in time to see sharp teeth and claws start to appear through the lining above his head
he blinks in disbelief and throws his bottle away as if the image came from the whiskey
oh my god theres
struggles hey no
screams stepek you stupid sonovabitch will you lay off the booze youve got the d
stepek is wide eyed and scared silly as the sound now begins under his feet and pincers begin to snip through the floor
he suddenly realizes that the whole floor is giving way beneath him and he grabs for a handful of cables as the floor collapses
the lower half of stepek is hanging in the slipstream kicking madly
we see that his legs are covered in wriggling creatures
he is losing his grip with one hand but still desperately clinging on to a bunch of cables with the other
suddenly an ugly pincer cuts the cables and stepek is gone
out into the night
suddenly the no
engine begins to backfire blasting back large gobs of orange flame
the oil heat and manifold gauges are off the dial and red lights frantically flash
desperately the pilot looks out of the window
pieces begin flying off the engine
the cowling disintegrates revealing the bare engine beneath
small figures are frantically busy ripping the engine to pieces
he is scared
holden for gods sake get up here on the double
whats the problem skip
just get up here
the navigator grimaces as he pushes past the dead co pilot
what is it skip
looking out windows hold em off
im taking her down
he peers out at the incredible sight of the creatures ripping off the wing skin and tearing huge plates from the cowlings
the camera pans down to his feet as the hatch door handle twists and then bursts open
a dozen bat like creatures swarm in
the navigator panics and reaches up grabbing the flare gun from its rack
he screams as the creatures attack and shoots right through the creatures bathing the aircraft with a bright ruby glow
struggling okay you little bastards
screams the flare shoots down the fuselage and smashes into him
wreathed in flames he falls back into the fuselage
creatures swarm all over the plane
the ball turret falls off
a wheel suddenly lowers then falls off
a flap flutters free and blows away
oil streams back into the slipstream and sections of the skin of the plane come away revealing the skeleton framework of the fuselage
he is fighting the controls
creatures are now in the cockpit plucking out the instruments
the pilot reaches to the throttle only to grab a creature that locks on to his gloved hand
flying the plane with his good hand he strikes and pummels at the attacking creatures with the other
it is now almost a flying skeleton
for the first time we see that it is heading for an island
a figure detaches itself from the machine and plummets away
he falls terror stricken through space
finally his chute opens
a slimy creature still clings to his gloved hand
he rips off the glove and throws it and the creature away
struggling jesus h
the approaching smoking plane bellies onto the sea bounces then skims along the wave tops careening up onto the beach where it twists around crazily before coming to a lopsided
the machine faces us head on and we see a glow coming from whats left of no
the camera zooms in rapidly to a green ball stuck in engine no
he has landed and is undoing his parachute harness
he looks around incredulously
the island is a junkyard a veritable graveyard of aircrafts
there are many aircrafts both old wrecks and futuristic looking ones lying everywhere
skeletal corpses are still left in some of the wrecks
the camera pans to the remains of one machine
it is an old american lockheed electra
it glints dull in the half light of dawn
painted on its side are two names amelia earhart and fred noonan
the camera continues to move through this panorama of metallic junk until it stops on a long chrome rod sticking up out of a pile of scrap
tilting up to the sky we see the clouds part as two gargantuan metal arms emerge and descend down toward the junkpile
the metal arms reach the chrome rod grip it tightly and begin to lift it up
wwe follow as the cylinder is pulled higher and higher finally coming to a stop in front of a giant eyeball
the camera pulls back to reveal that the eyeball belongs to austin grimaldi who carefully scrutinizes the orange diode held tightly in his needlenose pliers
satisfied that this is the piece he had lost in the machine he begins to re solder it in place
behind him a little girl with red hair comes into the room and walks up to him
its broken again isnt it daddy
concentrating yes dear
but daddys fixing it
hums watching how come its always breaking
i dont know sweetheart
when its fixed will you make more funny pictures for me
honey why dont you go play with your toys and let daddy finish his work okay
the little girl wanders around to the other side of the machine as austin flips a switch
once again the glass sphere sparkles and the holographic screen lights up
austin uses a tool to fine tune the holograph and an image begins to materialize the glass gates of kraan
as the image becomes clearer the camera pulls closer and closer to the holograph screen
the councils voices still ringing in her head taarna flies in over the demolished gates
below her the once beautiful city lies in ruins
gliding overtop the deserted streets she sees a column of smoke rising through the wrecked dome of the building in the towns center
as she watches the smoke rise she pulls hard on the reins and heads her bird up
the camera follows as she rides in through the shattered dome down to the council chambers below
corpses of the councilmen are strewn everywhere
in the center of the room a large pile of ancient books and manuscripts lie smouldering
reaching the floor taarna dismounts and starts to look around
at the head of the marble table sits the elder dead
in front of him a roll of parchment lies on the table
taarna opens it
carefully painted on the parchment is a circle of mountains their tops glowing green
taarna looks at it and puts it in her sack
then she notices that the elder is clutching something in his hand
prying his stiff fingers apart she finds a blood stained medallion just like the one her attacker wore on his chain
looking at the dead elder taarna grips the medallion tightly in her hand
taarna flies back out through the shattered dome and surveys the city below
all is quiet and dark except for a green glow coming from a second floor window
curious she flies over pulls up beside the window and climbs in
entering taarna sees the slimy silk like cocoon on the bed
the basket of fruit still sits on the floor
from within the webbing the green ball is glowing brightly
taarna looks at the parchment in her sack then at the glow coming from the cocoon
cautiously she approaches the cocoon sword drawn
suddenly a hand from within the cocoon grabs the ball and shoots forward ripping through the webbing and holding the ball up to taarnas face
the hand belongs to a hideously ugly witch who emerges from the cocoon cackling through snake like fangs
the sphere of uluhtec
look upon it taarna
look upon it with fear
for in its glow lies the end of heaven the beginning of hell
take it taarna
feel death in your hands
for death is upon you
and as you perish
so dies your race
the witchs eyes go green
screaming take it
she hurls tha ball at taarna who dodges it
the ball sails past her out the window
then taarna sword raised leaps at the witch slicing through her in rapid strokes
the witch cackles and crumbles into dust but her green eyes stay suspended in the air and her cackle echoes through the room
taarna backs away climbing out the window onto her bird
as she flies off she sees the witchs green ball high above her rising into the clouds and disappearing
the witchs green ball zooms through space as earth appears in the distance
then another object comes into sight
getting closer we see that is is a modern winged rocketplane of no determinable nationality soaring high above earth
the green meteorite passes briefly bathing the rocketplane in its glow
the rocketplane banks sharply then stabilizes
slowly the hatch doors in its belly open up revealing the underside of an automobile suspended in the open hatch
hydraulic metal arms emerge lowering the automobile out from the belly of the cruising rocketplane
we can see now that the car is a white corvette convertible
with a thunk the metal arms release the car and as the rocketplane blasts away the corvette begins its free fall to earth
as the car falls gracefully through space the driver plays with the wheel causing the corvette to bank smoothly one way then the other
once his direction is stable the driver clicks on the car radio and adjusts it through various channels until he settles on one
with the music playing the car falls closer and closer to earth entering and emerging from the cloud cover over the atmosphere
in the heat of entry the vehicles paint starts burning up
as he heads down over a deserted area the driver begins his approach
touching down at breakneck speed the smoking corvette bounces violently every part straining at the repeated impact
the drivers face is expressionless as he jams the car into high gear and floors it spinning the wheels in an attempt to translate downward momentum into forward motion
then he pops his drag chute to help slow down
tthis accomplished the expressionless driver releases the chute and speeds off down the road in a cloud of dust
from high above the building we see a crowd of reporters and t
newsmen waiting on the front steps
the corvette pulls up at the curb below and seeing it the reporters all start to run over
the camera zooms down and into the car
inside the driver reaches over unplugs a rubber hose and loosens the two large hex nuts which connect him to the car
as he gets out the reporters come running up
to driver doctor anrak six more mutants were sighted in arizona this morning
do you still say this has nothing to do with the green radiation from space
the driver walks on without speaking
walking alongside doctor is it true that the president himself pulled you off the jupiter six project so that you could investigate those mutations
doctor answer me that
he ignores the question and walks past the guard into the pentagon
around a large table sit the joint chiefs of staff members of the cabinet and a pretty secretary wearing a tight skirt
an argument is in progress as the expressionless doctor anrak enters
the camera follows him as he sits down next to one of the generals
well what i wanna know is whats the army doing about this
my constiuents are turning green
theyre growing arms on their backs
theres something or someone up there in space and the voters have a right to know about it
senator we have no proof that these mutations are the result of interference from outer space
in fact doctor anrak has just come in so lets hear what he has to say
the room goes silent as the doctor stands up
first of all there is no cause for alarm
as for the theories of interference by alien beings it is my firm opinion that we on earth are the only intelligent technically advanced civilization present in the universe
an enormous round spaceship the size of pittsburg hovers overhead
and whatever is causing these mutations is not from outer space
its more likely just an isolated biological pheno
suddenly the doctors head starts to jerk from side to side
everyone looks on not knowing how to react
as the doctor begins to move in short bursts like a broken robot he fixes his gaze upon the pretty secretary across the table
from the bottom of the huge spacecraft a metal tube emerges and starts to drill through the roof of the pentagon
the doctor starts to shake violently as he stares at the pretty secretary
suddenly he lunges at her sliding across the table
as the doctor struggles with the terrified girl the camera pans up to the ceiling where the metal tube from the spaceship drills through
descending upon them it sucks them up instantly
a metallic robot holding a clipboard is standing in front of a large glass receiving jar as doctor anrak comes through the tube and lands in the jar
as soon as the doctors feet hit the bottom of the jar the doctor breaks into a lot of small metallic parts
mechanical voice oh nice job
how am i supposed to fix this guy
zeke and edsel two alien space pilots are standing nearby at the control console
they look like big furry orange heads on stilts with arms coming out of the sider
to edsel i guess we turned it up a little too high
to robot sorry man
what about me ive gotta put this asshole back together
suddenly the pretty secretary comes through the tube and lands in the jar
shes a little mussed up but okay
gasp where am i
staring hey whos the chick
well look at my clothes
whos gonna pay for the dry cleaning
and where am i
i demand that you return me to my office immediately
too late molecular instability zone around spacecraft
you cannot leave
to zeke what
is he kidding
he looks at the robot who winks at him
youre stuck here
zeke and edsel try to keep straight faces
stunned but i have to be at my parents for dinner tonight
and my gynecologist appointment is on wednesday
would you ah like a drink
leading her away youll feel better after a glass of fresh blo aak
they disappear down a corridor
do you have any diet soda
to zeke ah typical robot
the first earth chick we see in ten years and hes gotta make a play for her
edsel jams the gearshift into d for drive and the ship lifts away from earth
hey do we have any of that plutonian nyborg left
just one bag
uh its in the transmitter compartment
uh thanks man
zeke opens a hatch and pulls out a double spouted plastic bag on wheels the size of a steamer trunk
it is full of white powder
he pours two fifteen foot lines of powder onto the floor
then he pauses
surveying the lines oh great
think this is enough
go for broke
good thinking man
as he resumes pouring zeke begins singing to himself in an alien tongue
when the lines are poured they both stand at the start of the trail of white powder and part their hair to reveal nostrils hidden in their foreheads
they both start to criss cross the room inhaling the white powder like vaccuum cleaners
as they happily snort the nyborg the camera pans back to the glass receiving jar and moves down through the broken pieces of doctor anrak
reaching his lifeless face the camera moves around to the back of the head
through the shattered metal we can see a green ball glowing inside anraks skullpiece
as the round spaceship moves through space a group of asteroids approach and whip past
up ahead a red sun turns white and goes super nova
gloria pearlman and the robot are lying in bed naked
they have just finished making love
she is smoking a cigarette
glazed that was incredible
ive never felt anything like it
i have been programmed to be fully proficient in sexual activities
do you want to go steady
gee i dont know
i already have a boyfriend
ah what he does not know will not hurt him
zeke and edsel are sitting at the controls staring wide eyed out into space
they are obviously stoned
suddenly a bell rings and the communicator screen lights up
a serious officers face appears on it
mothership calling starcruiser alpha
mothership calling starcruiser alpha
zeke looks over at the screen and then shouts into it
mothership calling starcruiser alpha
to zeke you gotta use the microphone
shouts into microphone whaddyawant man
now listen idiot
do i have to tell you eight hundred times
you dont call me man
you call me com op officer blix
now is that perfectly clear
into mike yeah sure
disgruntled you are to return immediately to the mother ship and pick up a humanoid civilian
your orders are to escort him to the interplanetary tribunal courtroom so that he can testify at the trial of lincoln sternn
and make it snappy
the screen goes blank
they finally got sternn
its about time
hang on man
here we go
zeke jams the gearshift into hyper drive
the round spaceship blasts forward at ten times the speed of light
zeke and edsels round spacecraft looks like an apple heading toward a freight train as it approaches the enormous mother ship
an ashtray full of roaches sits on the console
zeke is at the controls with a joint in his mouth
he is swaying back and forth eyes glazed
beside him edsel watches the mothership getting closer
to zeke you okay to land this thing
no problem man
huge red arrows point the way through the ten mile wide landing area as the round spaceship glides in
i think youre goin a little high man
its okay man
if theres one thing i know its how to drive when im stoned
its like you know your perspectives fucked so you just gotta let your hands work the controls as if youre straight
the round ship rams directly into a wall and crashes down skidding to a stop in front of the loading bay
oh wow good landing man
zeke and edsel press a button to open the hatch doors
as the door opens we see two metallic regolian guards waiting on the other side
between them stands a small shabbily dressed humanoid with a crooked jaw and cauliflower ears
this is hanover fiste
to zeke and edsel this man is to be delivered to the clik interplanetary tribunal courtroom clik galaxy versus lincoln sternn
the guards wheel away
meekly ah hello
zeke and edsel escort fiste down the corridor
to fiste umm youre gonna testify at sternns trial
they gotta give him at least like life
lincoln sternn is a kind and honourable man
camera pulls close to fistes face he will be freed
as the round spaceship journeys through space it passes through a fantastic space scape of disembodied rock statues and past a magnificent graffiti covered robot chained to an asteroid
yknow i wish theyd clean this place up man
its like pig city out here
gloria is getting dressed as the robot re charges his energy paks
but i dont understand
we laugh together
we care for each other
we have highly proficient sex
why cant we get married
look were different okay
lets leave it at that
the hatch opens and gloria and the robot walk through still talking
but mixed marriages just dont work
what if you get tired of me and run off with a vibrator or something
as they move through the room and out the other side they pass fiste who is sitting quietly near the receiving jar hands folded
looking around fiste notices a green glow coming from the bottom of the jar
he gets up quietly opens the jar and pokes through the scrap robot parts
finding the small green ball in anraks head he pulls it out and looks at it
zeke and edsel are sitting at the controls driving carefully
fiste carrying the green ball comes up and sits down beside them
there it is man
im gonna hang a louie here
to fiste yeah well it wont be long now
are you sure youre gonna testify for sternn
fiste says nothing
he just clutches the green ball and stares into space
zeke and edsel look at each other and shrug
an enormous brightly lit multi level space station courthouse floats into view completely filling the screen
zeke and edsels round spaceship is just a speck as it enters the frame approaching the mammoth structure
the ship locks into the dock and the exit hatch opens
gloria and the robot come through first ahead of zeke edsel and fiste
ill marry you but on one condition
i want a jewish wedding
a jewish wedding
but this is space of the population are robots
well find me a robot rabbi
i give them six months man
he doesnt even look jewish
gloria and the robot disappear around a corner as zeke and edsel escort fiste through the hatch
fiste is carrying the small green ball
as they lead fiste away the camera pulls back out through a space port and moves along the outside of the slowly rotating space station
at the top the camera zooms down through a massive glass domed ceiling and into a huge inter galactic courtroom
voices echo below us
are you captain lincoln f
as we move down we see square jawed captain sternn his shifty eyed lawyer and the cold prosecutor all standing before the judge
sternn is smirking confidently as the prosecutor reads from a long page of charges
lincoln sternn you stand here accused of twelve counts of murder in the first degree
fourteen counts of armed theft of federation property
the hostile humanoid and alien faces all stare at sternn with hateful accusing eyes
twenty two counts of piracy in high space

thirty seven counts of rape and one moving violation

whispers to sternn not guilty

sternn and his lawyer move to their seats

zeke and edsel enter with fiste and push their way to the front
the prosecution calls hanover fiste
calling hanover fiste
calling hanover fiste

zeke and edsel sit down while hanover fiste small and shabby walks up to the witness stand nervously clutching the small green ball in his hand
as he passes sternn and his lawyer continue to argue

shouting at himself awww gimme a break

rising in crazed anger pointing as he screams hes nothin but a low down double dealin back stabbin larcenous perverted worm sternn and his lawyer look on horrified as fistes
body starts to grow
hangins too good for him
new muscles tear through fistes shabby clothes
burnins too good for him
growing larger he starts foaming at the mouth
he should be torn into little bitsy pieces and buried alive fiste rams his hands down onto the witness stand shattering it completely
ill kill him
he hurls the prosecutor aside and moves towards sternn with thundering footsteps
still growing he rips apart the judges bench as he passes it
finally he stands towering in rage over the terrified to fiste h h hey hanover
n now take it easy hanover im sure we can talk this ov
instinctively sternn leaps back as fistes giant hands come smashing down in the spot where sternn stood
the gallery scatters screaming as sternn runs for the door
slavering fiste thunders after him
sternn runs through the exit bolting the door behind him
fiste follows tearing the door apart and bringing the entire courtroom wall down in the process
running down a hallway sternn passes a group of regolian cops who raise their weapons in an attempt to block the rampaging fiste
halt clik in the name of the federation clik
where is your corridor pass
to other regolians unco operative humanoid clik blast him
they open fire but fiste is unstoppable
still growing he grabs the regolianss weapons crunches them up and eats them
you are now in violation of code n clik paragraph a
unauthorized consumption of federation property
please come quietly clik thenk yew
with a single clap of his enormous hands fiste crushes the regolians metal skulls together into an accordian the thickness of a dime
he races through a metallic hallway and ducks into a boiler room then down a long dark tunnel
at the end of the tunnel sternn comes to a dead end and stops to rest
oh this looks good
growls oh duck under here
ill get you
i think ill turn here runs gasping come on feet dont fail me now
runs ah gasp ah whew lost him
okay hanover youve had this coming
taking a deep breath sternn reaches into his pocket pulls out a wad of bills and counts them out as he hands them to lets see thirty three thirty four
thirty five thousand zuleks
taking money snothin boss
counting his money fiste starts shrinking back to his normal size
sternn pulls a lever which opens up the floor below fiste who screams falling out into space
as fiste slides out sternn grabs the money from fistes hand and smiles
all is quiet across this vast expanse of rusted pipes and barren desert
the silence is broken by a whistling sound which gets louder and louder
a green ball lands in the dirt in front of us
fluttering down around it are hanover fistes tattered clothes
then the burnt ashes of hanovers body land in a small pile beside his clothes
panning up we see taarna flying on her bird in the distance
she swoops down and flies through a maze of rusting pipes and cables which look like the ramnants of an ancient power station
then she steers her bird through a hidden opening in the rotting floor and enters a magnificent secret hideaway cut deep into the rock
landing her bird on a circular slab of gleaming marble taarna dismounts and walks over to a shimmering pool
here she disrobes and picking up a small gold pitcher she pours an ancient oil over herself
it shines and sparkles as it touches her skin
then she steps into the water where her body seems to sparkle even brighter
finishing her sacred bath she steps out and walks to a stone wall
when she touches it a rock panel slides away to reveal a gold chest
taarna opens it
inside the chest lies a glistening set of armoured garments so bright that taarna must shield her eyes for a moment
then as she looks down at the armour the voice of taarak the defender comes into her head
to defend this is the pact
but when life loses its value and it taken for nought then the pact is
to avenge through a series of dissolves we see taarnas hands sensuously fitting the various metallic pieces over her firm body
finally we pull back to see her fully
standing before us glistening in the torch light she looks magnificent
reaching once more into the chest taarna pulls out a golden sword
as she holds it it seems to vibrate almost buzzing in her hands
suddenly she swings it slicing cleanly through one of the stone torches on the rock wall
as the burning torch falls to the ground taarna leaves
from over our heads taarna comes soaring past her armour gleaming in the rays of the setting sun
below her she sees a metallic holiday town filled with barbarian soldiers
drunken blue men fight in the streets strange animals run around loose and dead or drunken bodies lie in the gutters
looking down amidst the melee she sees three winged creatures tied up in front of a bar
the camera zooms in on one of the creatures saddlebags
it has a silver medallion set into the leather identical to the one which taarna pried from the elders fingers
barbarian honky tonk music fills the crowded room as various barbarian soldiers sit drinking and fondling the bar girls who are dressed in cheap flashy metal outfits
three of the blue barbarians are particularly drunk and rowdy as they push a non barbarian down dump a drink on his head laugh and kick him
taarna walks in through the swinging silver and plexiglass doors past the three soldiers kicking their victim
she sits down at the bar
the three brutish blue soldiers finish stomping the man and walk over to the bar crowding close around taarna
a new one
to taarna where you from baby
taarna ignores him
doesnt talk much does she
she doesnt have to talk for what i want to do with her
it slowly moves down to her sword and unclips the safety strap
running his hand across her breastplate cmon baby lets see whats under there
starting to undo her breastplate yeah lets have a look
taarna slowly stands up pushing their hands away and takes a step back
heey shes tough
maybe she wants to fight
they all laugh
or maybe she wants to take us all on
still laughing they move towards her
in a blinding flash taarna draws her golden sword and wielding it like a samurai master slices off all three of their heads
in an instant the sword is back in its sheath
the barbarians heads stop laughing as they fall to the ground
the music stops and everyone in the bar stares at taarna
stepping over the bodies taarna walks up to the bartender pulls out the parchment picture of the glowing mountains and shows it to him
the bartender looks at it carefully then points out the window
beyond the oasis
taarna nods and leaves
his eyes start to turn green
the camera gets closer and closer to his glowing eyes until the green glow turns into the image of a ball lying in the ground in austins holograph
austin is crouched over the machine turning several knobs trying to make the ball move
to himself hmmm
must be jammed
frustrated austin picks up a flashlight opens up a compartment underneath the control knobs and takes a look inside
while austin fiddles inside the machine we see two hands appear on the holograph screen and pick up the green ball
austin looks over to the holograph and notices
whered it go
as the hands cradle the green ball the camera pulls back to reveal a skinny unco ordinated boy wearing thick eyeglasses carrying the sphere across his backyard
this is dan
it all started when i found the green meteorite
i read in farradays life of the planets that smaller ones like this are supposed to burn up when they enter the atmosphere but for some reason this one didnt
dan carries the ball into a typical small town house
as the narration continues we follow two red wires down from the t
antenna along the roof and into dans attic window
the wires run through a bucket of water and are hooked up to some electronic parts on dans desk
so i brought it up to my room stuck it in my rock collection and forgot about it
i was experimenting with natural electricity
the camera pans around the room to show various displays of dans scientific tinkering blue ribbon science projects transparent models of a man and a woman showing all internal organs
and many books
in the corner the green ball sits in dans rock collection
at his desk dan impatiently shuffles through the dusty pages of an old scientific journal
and with the storm warnings up i figured maybe tonight id hit the jackpot
all i needed was a little juice
he looks out the window at the gathering storm
crackling from the sky a bolt of lightning strikes the television antenna and surges along the wires into the attic
the lightning flashes into dans apparatus lighting it up brightly
suddenly an electric arc jumps from the bucket of water and crosses the room to join with thw ball on his shelf
caught in the middle dan begins to glow green
looking at his green arms oh jesus
the electrical field opens up a shimmering gateway into another universe and dan de materializes
we float in darkness for a moment as black shapeless images zoom past
i felt like i was nothing just atoms floating in the darkness
then tiny beams of light join to form a glow in the corner of the screen
the glow gets brighter and starts moving slowly around the screen
now we can make out some of the images whipping past a half formed hand pages of a book a crumbling pyramid a green ball
then a body started to re form around me
only it wasnt my body this one had muscles
sturdy muscular parts begin to materialize around the moving light
they join up with each other to form a powerfully built human figure
finally a mans face takes shape and as it forms eveything gets brighter and clearer
it was a great body but i wasnt too crazy about the face
the powerful figure den turns slowly as he floats and begins to look at his hands and arms
moving his mouth he speaks in a new voice deep and powerful
feeling head hmmm
suddenly the background explodes into fields of radiant colours as the body accelerates away from us and passes through a second shimmering gateway
den strong masculine and hairless materializes cradled in the hand of a huge stone idol
he is naked and unconscious above him the glowing green ball is held in the idols other hand
the camera pulls back to show that the idol is standing on the deck stop a huge truncated pyramid
the deck forms a walkway around a swirling pool of green water
kneeling all around the seething pool are lizard men wearing priests robes
two of them stand beside a glass coffin
inside the coffin lies a naked girl bound and gagged
chanting softly uluhtec ulutec
directly in fron of the idol a regal looking queen wearing a revealing velvet cloak is praying to the raging water
by the powers of the glowing loc nar placed in your idols hand i demand you come forth uluhtec
the waters of the sacrifical pool rage more violently and a low rumble is heard far below
the green ball loc nar glows brightly as den opens his eyes looks down and notices his enormous genitals
seeing an animal skin hanging from the idol he rips off a piece and wraps it around himself
there was no way i was gonna walk around this place with my dork hangin out
suitably covered he surveys the ritual taking place below him
this looked like something right out of the ten commandments
the queen is kneeling before the seething water
grant me your strength in return for a living mortal sacrifice
it has been ordained
come forth uluhtec
i demand it
two lizard priests remove the terrified girl from the glass case and hold her out over the swirling water
the queen nods and the two priests drop her in
seeing the girl struggle in the water dens eyes grow wide
whatd they do that for
he stands and dives into the raging pool swimming powerfully towards the drowning girl
reaching her den grabs the girls bound ankles hooks them over his head and drags her through a decayed hole in the underwater wall
inside a stone tunnel they are swept along by the current
normally id be dead by now
i kept thinking i was going to run out of air but my new body worked great
i just hoped her body was working as good as mine
den and the girl are washed out into a pond at the center of a beautiful field of lilies
he pulls her out of the water unconscious
as he unties her she begins to stir
she takes dens hand and lies back in the flower her beautiful breasts exposed in the sunlight
she had the most beautiful eyes
i wanted to make some conversation but i found my new self asking the same old stupid questions
are you from around here
well you may not believe this but im from another world from a place called earth
i too am from earth
how did you get here
my name is katherine wells and im from the british colony of gibraltar
time makes no diff erence here but there it was the summer of
it was evening id gone for a walk on the cliffs when suddenly a sphere fell from the sky
following its glow i came to a shining gate made out of light
unable to resist i stepped through it and awoke in this world
there i was thin and weakly fit only to stay indoors
she stands up but here somehow i am stronger more alive she stretches seductively more fully a woman
youre not kidding
standing i too seem better equipped on this world
he holds out his arm my arms are more powerful
strecthes his fingers even my fingers seem to hold great strength
katherine walks up close to den takes his hand and touches the fingers to her breast
you saved my life
i have no reward to give you but if any part of me pleases your senses i would give it willingly
she circles her nipple with his baby finger
this was great there was no way id get a chick like this back on earth
i mean look at her
taking katherine in his arms den lays her down on a bed of flowers and begins to tenderly make love to her
there was only one problem
a spiked boot appears in the frame
the camera pans up to show a large ugly hairy beast man standing over den and the camera then pulls back to reveal the entwined couple completely surrounded by a
horde of grim bestial warriors
i dont know who these jerks were but they sure picked a bad time to show up
the ugly beast men grab den and katherine as we the beast captain keeps his machine gun trained on den as the soldiers lead him into the cavernous room
they split us up and took me to this weird castle type place
i wanted to find out where theyd taken katherine but none of these guys seemed to speak english
in the middle of the room there is a round stone pedestal with a throne carved into it
on the throne sits ard a child like ruler with a sadistic glint in his eye
they tell me you are den of earth the one who dared to steal the female sacrifice from the queen
this guy was a shrimp so i figured id play it tough
where is the girl
i am ard supreme leader of the revolution and the next ruler of the world
tougher the girl
well arent we fierce
if you are truly as tough as you seem then you will serve me well
but first a test
two bestial guards approach from behind brandishing curved short swords
den turns instinctively dodges the first thrust and delivers a bone shattering elbow to the beasts head crushing his skull
spinning with his own momentum den throws a rock hard fist into the second guards chest snapping his rib cage and sending him flying across the room
without pausing the bald muscleman grabs the nearby beast captain and lifts him into the air by his machine gun
the captain hangs on as den twists the gun butts it into the creatures groin and then drives the weapon through the captains jaw
the creature crumples leaving den with the gun
i was pretty good at this stuff
you are worthy to serve me
aiming machine gun at him give me the girl or die
taking it lightly well if i have a choice ill take death
so be it
den fires spraying a row of bullets across ards body
the bullets blast big yellow holes in ards chest but there is no blood
ard looks up and laughs
ha ha ha
youll have to do better than that
as den looks on ards wounds miraculously close up and heal themselves over
i could see why they made this guy their leader
standing up but if youre really interested in the girl ive had her encased in glass
ard pulls the velvet covering off of a glass box to reveal katherine unconscious sealed inside
shes sleeping but only i can awaken her
what do you want of me
i want you to steal the sacred loc nar
what is this loc nar
the queens glowing sphere you fool
the sacrifice to uluhtec can only be performed by the possessor of the sacret loc nar
calling out norl
norl a huge gorilla man in a purple cloak steps forward
to den this is norl my bravest warrior
you will go with him to the queens castle and steal the loc nar
then i will give you the girl
and if i refuse
if you refuse you die she dies everybody dies
sounded reasonable to me
den looks down at katherines motionless body
in the moonlight den and norl lead a squad of beast warriors armed with automatic weapons along the river towards the queens castle
to den ssh
guard post ahead
we must go underground
norl lifts a rock to reveal an underground passageway
this guy norl seemed to know what he was doing
and for a gorilla his english wasnt half bad
den and the warriors enter the underground passage
the group carrying torches moves along the dark tunnel
they pass a bubble window with shark faced eels swimming on the other side
to den were underneath the castle moat
an ugly growl echoes through the tunnel up ahead
the warriors freeze and murmur to each other in their own languages
to norl what are they saying
they talk of the savage beast who prowls these catacombs with a fierce hunger and sharp teeth
gestures six inches long
a dog faced warrior shakes his head and says something to norl
indicating sixteen inches long
suddenly a savage beast appears and chomps his long razor sharp teeth into one of the warriors at the end of the line
den norl and the remaining warriors run on through the tunnel as behind them the monster pulls his victim apart
den norl and the remaining warriors arrive at a door in the rock wall
to den now we separate
you and korg take this door into the queens quarters
the rest of us will move through the walls and enter her chamber from the other side
whoever gets the loc nar first will return it to ard
good luck den
den nods puts out his torch and carefully opens the door as norl moves off
den and korg silently enter
across the dark room the glow of the green ball casts a pale light
whispers and points loc nar
it was just like the ball i dug up in my back yard
they tip toe towards it
as i saw the loc nars glow i had this real funny feeling
all by themselves my hands reached forward to touch it
but the loc nar moved out of the way
instead my hands felt something else warm flesh
then the lights came on
in the brightly lit room den is standing before the beautiful semi clad queen and holding her firm naked breasts in his hands
looking around he sees that he and kong are surrounded by a brigade of the queens ugly guards swords raised
talk about embarassing
smiling kill them
the queens guards attack with battle axes clubs and swords
as den knees one in the groin and swings his gun into anothers face four of the guards surround korg and club his brains out
but den still going strong throws two guards into the wall and heaves a third out the window
as the queen watches with glee more guards rush into the room and den is finally over powered and held down
the captain of the guards places a long knife against dens throat
can i slit his throat your majesty
the queen eyeing dens magnificent body sighs
yes slit his throat
thank you your majesty
as the captain presses his knife against dens flesh the queen suddenly raises her hand
i have ah something better in mind
she takes dens hand and leads him into an adjoining room as the guards grumble to one another
jeez not again
this always happens
look shes the queen
she can do whatever she wants
the queen stands before den hands on her hips and a funny look in her eye
if you please me i may let you live
she smiles and approaches den
what must i do
satisfy my appetites
the queen lets her cloak drop to the floor as she gets closer
she is naked underneath
eighteen years of nuthin and now twice in one day
what a place
come with me
she steps forward and takes his hand leading him towards the bed
den and the queen are lying undressed on the enormous bed
the queen has a very contented look on her face
den looks exhausted
as the neverwhere moon rises outside the chamber window the queen slowly runs her hand over dens bulging muscles
softly the rising moon climaxes our love den
is is a sign a new beginning
yes a sign
i had no idea what she was talking about
stroking him neverwhere is a troubled land but together we could calm it
we could rule side by side
your strength has brought great peace to my restless body
it could bring great peace to all the troubled people of this land
i knew i was good but i didnt know i was that good
suddenly the captain and his guards burst through the door
the loc nar is missing stolen the queen jumps to her feet in a rage and points to den
you make love to me while your accomplices steal the magic sphere
the guards grab den as the queen snatches one of their big spiked clubs
to guards hold him still
i will kill him myself boy was she pissed off
heaving the guards aside den breaks free and jumps out the chamber window
den falls down down into the swirling waters of the castle moat
she is livid
prepare the flying lizards
i want his head
pulling himself out of the moat den knocks a guard off his leopard horse and rides off
ard is kneeling at the edge of the sacrificial pool
beside him sits a long glass case wrapped in chains
through the chains we see katherine trapped inside fully conscious and terrified
ards bestial warriors stand all around carrying torches and spears
above them the loc nar sits glowing in the stone idols hand
by the power of the magic loc nar placed in your idols hands i command you come forth uluhtec
the green water in the pool immediately begins to churn violently and leap into the air
a bolt of lightning crackles in the sky
den is racing across the barren desert on his leopard horse
visible in the distance is the outline of the huge truncated pyramid where he first saved katherine
as he rides he sees the green glow of the loc nar sparkling in the glass surfaces of the coffin in front of it
to himself katherine
he spurs his leopard horse on into the night
the queen riding a flying lizard leads her army in pursuit of den
pointing there he is your majesty
up ahead silhouetted in the moonlight she sees den riding up the steps of the pyramid
the camera pans to the green glow atop the torch lit pyramid
the loc nar
shouting to her men faster
to the pyramid
she whips her lizard harder
ard is incanting to the raging water while two hooded monks stand beside him holding the struggling katherine out over the pool
here is your sacrifice uluhtec
now give me your power
to monks throw her in
chanting the name uluhtec the two monks start to throw the girl in when suddenly a third monk leaps forward and grabs her kicking the other two monks into the
the intruders hood falls away and his bald head gleams in the moonlight
youll ruin everything
ard jumps up and runs toward the loc nar perched in the stone idols hand
grabbing it ard holds the glowing ball above him
to his guards kill them
kill them both
suddenly a hand leaps out of the darkness gripping the loc nar just above ards hand it is the queen
the loc nar is mine
struggling stupid bitch
get away from me
as ard and the queen fight over the loc nar the queens troops pour in and battle with ards soldiers
thunder roars overhead
holding katherine in one arm den smashes a nearby soldier and grabs the beasts spear
with the battle raging all around him den looks up at the sky
lightning crackles illuminating the night with electricity
den reaches down picks up the long chain that was wrapped around the glass case and attaches one end to his spear
he kicks the other end into the raging water then heaves the spear with all his might into the head of the stone idol
in the same instant a bolt of lightning fires down from the sky striking the idol full force
the lightning bolt travels through the spear and down the chain into the water
suddenly the electrical energy arcs across to join with the loc nar
holding onto the loc nar ard and the queen begin to glow green then de materialize into a shimmering dimensional warp
the troops stop fighting and look on in amazement until all that remains is the glowing loc nar hanging in mid air
to den where did they go
they are gone
that is all that matters
they probably went back to earth
boy will mom be surprised
suddenly the loc nar falls to the ground at dens feet
looking down the loc nar
you could have the power of uluhtec
you could be ruler over all these people
looking over the throng forget it
in a single powerful leap den carrying katherine bounds up onto the queens flying lizard and they fly off
the amazed troops watch for a moment then shrug and resume fighting
katherine clings to den as they fly
oh but den with the loc nar you could have returned to earth
i like it better here
the lizard banks sharply away from us and carries them into the distance
on earth im nobody
but here i am the camera pans down the stone statue to the glowing sphere which lies abandoned on the ground
the soldiers are gone
as we watch time begins to accelerate and the neverwhere pyramid ages and crumbles all around the green ball
the earth heaves and shifts and dense vegetarian grows up through the cracks in the ground
a prehistoric man walks up and sees the glowing ball under a fern
fascinated he picks it up and looks at it as the foot of a tyrannosaurus rex comes down crushing him
time advances again as the dinosaur becomes a skeleton and a biblical tent community grows up around the ball
in the fire light the nomadic tribesmen are watering their animals when one of the camels paws at the ground uncovering the glowing ball
scared the camel struggles and trys to break its ropes
out of nowhere a roman legion attacks slaughtering the tribesmen
time accelerates again and the conquering romans build a temple placing the green ball in the head of a golden idol
then the romans grow fat and debauched while slave girls feed them grapes
as the ball glows the temple crashes down around the debauched romans covering them and the green ball in rubble
over the ruins of the temple a succession of primitive mud and clay huts evolve into the thatched roof cottages of a medieval village
a medieval stone cutter finds the ball and mortars it in with his stones as he builds a water well in the centre of the village
satisfied with his work he lowers the bucket to draw himself a drink
behind him an ox cart comes roaring around a corner
the axle breaks and a heavy wooden wheel careens along striking the stone cutter in the back and knocking him into the well
time advances once more as the medieval village grows and transforms into a victorian style town
it is evening and the stone well now sits under a gazebo at the centre of a gas lit village green
a fancy carriage carrying a victorian gentleman passes by and circles the green
moving in through a window across the street we see a seductive looking woman dressing herself in black garters and lace
this is intercut with the carriage circling the green until the woman who looks like a high class harlot finishes dressing and leaves her room
crossing the street she walks up to the gazebo and leans provocatively up against the well
the gentleman gets out of his carriage approaches the woman and propositions her
she smiles touches and teases him
we pan down their legs to the green ball glowing in the well wall
suddenly red blood begins to drip over the ball and the womans body falls to the ground
the camera pans up to the well bucket where the gentleman is washing the blood from his hands
as time begins to move forward again the man ages and hobbles away as the well crumbles and cheap turn of the century row housing grows up covering the green
the town becomes dirtier and blacker and smokestacks blow soot into the morning sky
almost on cue the doors of the houses open and grim coal miners emerge shuffling through the filthy streets on their way to work
the camera pans down to a drain in the gutter
a rat appears
panning back up the street is now empty
a bell is heard ringing and a horse drawn red cross cart pulls around a corner and into view
masked workers follow the cart
one rings the bell while the others pull corpses from the doorways and load them into the cart
the gutters and windowsills are now full of rats
time advances again and the buildings become deserted derelicts
their decaying timbers groan under the weight
a support snaps and one of the buildings starts to collapse
falling amidst the crumbling plaster and rotting wood is the glowing green ball
as the ball hits the ground it is covered over by rubble
the rubble becomes bleached by the hot sun and the landscape grows drier
sand blows all around covering over everything
as the sandstorm clears the entire terrain is nothing but desert
in the distance we can see a group of people walking
the people appears to be a band of aboriginal workmen carrying futuristic laser shovels over their shoulders
they are led by a goateed archaeologist with an elaborate metal detector
as he walks his detector starts bleeping
he points to a spot on the ground and the natives start digging with their laser shovels
one of the workers finds something
the archaeologist waves the workers away and directs a tread driven shovel sifter up to the spot
the shovel sifter digs in and pulls up a large chunk of desert
when the sand has sifted out we see the tarnished loc nar in the machines grip
it is not glowing
the machine swivels and a native foreman plucks the loc nar from the shovel sifters teeth
as the foreman touches it the loc nar starts glowing brightly
the foremans hands turn green
he looks at his green hands then he looks over to the archaeologist
suddenly the foremans entire body glows green and crumbles into dust
the archaeologist and the natives stare in horror at the glowing loc nar lying in the pile of green dust
the camera comes down from high above the city
the general shape and outline of new york looks familiar but as we get closer we sense that something is different
fires are burning in various locations below us and intermittent gunshots become audible as the narration begins
yeah new york big deal
scum centre of the world
moving down through the skyscrapers the city gets dirtier and slummier
we pass a dead man hanging from a tenement clothesline
below us scruffy children dodge traffic as they play gyro ball in the garbage filled street
and now theyre talking about letting in low lifes from other planets too
under the narration the camera turns a corner and zooms down through the roof of a parked taxicab
it stops full frame on the newspaper held in the cabdrivers hands
a slow pan across the front page reveals that the paper is the new york times july one headline reads traffic deaths over holiday weekend
another reads venus declared rd state
the camera stops on a headline reading professor discovers ancient relic to be shown in n
there is an accompanying photo of the goateed archaeologist and his beautiful daughter standing beside a glass and metal case containing the loc nar
a knocking is heard on the cabs window and the driver throws down the newspaper
from outside you free
my names harry canyon
i drive a cab
he flips a switch which unlocks the rear door
the young man climbs into the back seat and closes the door
harrys yellow checker cab pulls out into traffic
the vehicle looks pretty normal except for some vaguely futuristic chrome panels cut into the sides and thicker deeper bumpers
harry slides open the plexiglass shields separating him from his passenger
where to pal
what a joke
used to be a nice place until they turned it into low rent housing
now its a dump
i wouldnt live there if you paid me
he switches on the car radio
the music plays as harrys cab passes various time altered new york landmarks a graffiti covered empire state building windows all boarded up a decrepit lincoln centre the marquis reading
continuous live sex show also inter planetary mud wrestling new ultra tech buildings crammed between half destroyed wall street office buildings garbage everywhere
inside the cab the young man pulls a gun out of his jacket sticks his arm through the opening in the plexi glass shield and holds the gun to harrys
okay sucker hand over your cash now
this city is really going to the dogs
harrys foot stretches forward and pushes a footswitch
a buzzing is heard and the young mans body suddenly dematerializes
the gun which he held at harrys head falls to the seat beside harry who picks it up and tosses it into the glove compartment beside all sorts of other
futuristic guns and weapons
nobody touches me unless i want em to
the camera is close up on the illustrated banner over the main entrance
the banner reads treasures of the loc nar coming july th
we pan down to the museum doors as a mans body comes crashing through the plate glass and sprawls forward cut and bleeding
it is the goateed professor from the desert
his daughter runs out behind him ripping her clothes on the broken glass
the girl takes off down the museum stairs as men with laser guns come out and start firing
a fat evil looking man rudnick bends down and grabs the professors head jerking it up
to henchmen hes dead
get the girl
the girl clothes torn runs out into the street just as harrys cab comes cruising by
she runs alongside pounding on the window
to harry help me please
a laser shot narrowly misses her and blasts harrys side mirror
harry flips the switch unlocking the passenger door and waves her in
normally my rule is dont get involved but something about this dame got to me
she dives in the back and harry floors it
the cab screams away as laser shots land all around
in shock breathless the loc nar
they wanted it
but my father wouldnt tell them
now im the only one
interupting relax sister
theres a cop station up here
harry looks at her in the rear view mirror
the girl has fainted
just what i needed
guess im a sucker for a pretty face
the police station is an all metal building with no windows
a plaque on thr front reads n
police nd division
harrys cab pulls up
he gets out carries the unconscious girl up to the front door and pushes a buzzer
over intercom police
i wanna report a murder
over intercom so what else is new
you gonna let me in or what
a buzzer sounds and the door slides open
harry carries the girl in and heads across the room toward the main desk
as he walks he passes cops using a strange metal detector vaccuum cleaner to suck dangerous weapons from a pair of suspects
piles of weapons can be seen in the machines transparent belly
okay this guys clean next
harry comes up to the front desk and starts to lay the girl down in a chair
to harry before you go any further pal i gotta tell you its cash up front
a thousand bucks a day for a full investigation
another thousand if the assailant is caught
he picks up the girl and turns to leave
shouting after harry you think you can do better
join one of the vigilante groups
theres a list of em outside
harry carrying the girl comes out of the police station as a patrol car screeches to a halt in front of him
two cops emerge dragging a green alien with four arms
i tell you im an american citizen
i just lost my papers
to himself goddamn illegal aliens
harry heads toward his cab
so here i was stuck with this beautiful girl
i knew she was gonna be nuthin but trouble
he looks around at the sleazy neighbourhood
every doorway and alley seems to have a rapist or thug lurking
but i didnt feel right just leaving her for the sickos
i dunno maybe im gettin sentimental or something
this futuristic bachelor pad is constructed entirely of brightly coloured molden plastic
bowling trophies sit on a shelf underneath a neon buweiser clock
the place is a mess
harry carries the girl in pushes the light button to on and lays her down on the sofa
as he takes off his jacket he looks down at the unconscious figure her clothes torn in all the right places
she moans and starts to come to
where am i
walking over to a hi tech plastic bar harry pushes a button and a machine pours and mixes a drink
he hands the girl the glass
she sits up and drinks
looking at harry theyd have killed me if it wasnt for you
whatd they want to snuff you for
