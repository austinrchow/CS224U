a sleek british sports car talks directly to us in a pixilated garbled video
hes out of breath
crates are visible behind him
were in the shadowy bowels of a steel room
this is agent leland turbo
i have a flash transmission for agent finn mcmissile
my covers been compromised
everythings gone pear shaped
you wont believe what ive found out here
he angles our camera view reveals a porthole through which we can see flames rising in the distance
this is bigger than anything weve ever seen
and no one even knows it exists
finn i need backup
but dont call the cavalry it could blow the operation
and be careful
its not safe out here
angry voices o
time for turbo to go
transmitting my grids now
w a tiny crab boat crabby crests over massive swells
alright buddy were here
right where you paid me to bring you
question is why
a metallic blue sports car circa the s emerges from the
cagey smooth hed turn heads driving through any intersection in the world
meet finn mcmissile
im looking for a car
hey pal you cant get any further away from land than out here
exactly where i want to be
well i got news for you buddy
theres nobody out here but us
suddenly a horn a combat ship the size of most cruise ships
finn quickly backs into the shadows out of sight
what are you doing out here
what does it look like genius
well turn around and go back where you came from
and whos gonna make me
a laser sight hits crabby between the eyes
dont get your prop in a twist
as he turns to leave what a jerk
looks like its the end of the line
on crabbys deck finn is gone
finn he hangs off the side of combat ship clandestine
were with finn as the ship continues on cuts through the darkness with purpose
suddenly small flames appear perhaps a knot or so away
a flame rises above finn the ship
it illuminates an oil derrick
finn fires a grappling hook to the derrick and swings toward it
hes going to slam into the side with brute force his tires sprout a magnetic exoskeleton
he sticks to the derrick and now drives vertically up up up
from this vantage point hundreds of derricks appear
finn approaches a loading bay from above hides
he watches as gremlins pacers and assorted other cars scurry about
leland turbo this is finn mcmissile
im at the rally point
leland its finn
an access door opens loudly below
a boxy monacle wearing german car enters
this is professor otto zundapp
in german and english too many cars here
out of my way
here it is professor
zundapp approaches a nosy pacer who idles next to a crate
you wanted to see this before we load it
a forklift opens the crate inside is a tv camera packed carefully in foam
finn snaps photos furiously
a tv camera
what does it actually do
this camera is extremely dangerous
what are you up to now professor
finn angling for a better view fires suspension wires which sail clear to the other side of the derrick thok
they hook tightly onto a steel girder
finn slides out onto the wire like an acrobat then expels another cross wire for support
this is valuable equipment
make sure it is properly secured for the voyage
you got it
finn lowers himself
he snaps more pictures
hey professor z
zundapp turns as a crane lowers a car sized crate
grem and acer an orange gremlin and a green pacer flank it
this is one of those british spies we told you about
this one we caught sticking his bumper where it didnt belong
finn produces semi automatic guns from his side readies himself for a tag team spy fight with his buddy leland
agent leland turbo
the crate is lifted revealing a crushed cubed leland turbo
finns eyes go wide
another derrick flame rises behind him casts a finn shaped shadow over the professor
he looks up
its finn mcmissile
hes seen the camera
finn unloads with bullets as he starts to retreat he bad guy cars are waiting for him on the catwalk where he just came from blowtorches ready
finn stuck in midair notices an angry crane
finn grins having just found his escape
finn releases three of his four cables swinging indiana jones style on the last one toward the where he lands on its boom drives up and launches off it where
he lands moving onto another deck
finn now drives spraying oil and screeching around corners
a gremlin in pursuit hits the oil patch loses control and plummets off the side of the rig
the gremlin falls
its like an eternity
he smashes into the water and breaks into a million pieces
on finn now set upon by or more pursuing cars
he has nowhere to go but up up up a ramp toward the helipad
he spies some gasoline barrels fires a single bullet which cuts through its leather straps sending barrels down the ramp past the pursuing cars to the bottom where they explode
in a chain reaction back up the ramp taking out at least cars
on the helipad finn blasts into view pulls to a stop
no more road
nowhere else to go
the bad guy cars that are still in pursuit surround him fire up their blowtorches
about to pounce
the second time weve seen this grin
it means hes got something cooking
finns reverse lights appear
he drives backward off the edge of the helipad to the shock of the other cars
he turns himself so hes grill first cleanly cutting into the water
he emerges now sprouting hydrofoil and speeds away
get to the boats
the boats an army of combat ships quickly drop into the sea and churn water with unprecedented fury as they quickly make up the distance between them and finn firing
bullets as they do so
hes getting away
not for long
the lead combat ship quietly drops a torpedo into the water
it skips along connecting with finn in his rear and exploding with such force that water skyrockets into the night clouds
underwater mcmissile sinks
then he blinks
were starting to like this grin and what follows it
he now converts into a submarine
from his trunk he releases four decoy tires which float to the surface like body parts
on the derrick professor zundapp watches it all from far away
hes dead professor
with finn mcmissile gone who can stop us now
tow mater a rusty tow truck putters into view
tow mater thats who
is here to help you
he approaches a broken down sedan on the side of the road
he drives around to the front catching otis face for the first time
gosh im so sorry
i thought i could make it this time but
he tries to start his engine stalls smooth like pudding huh
ah who am i kidding
ill always be a lemon
mater hooks his friend and starts towing him
well dadgum youre leaking oil again
must be your gaskets
hey look on the bright side this is your tenth tow this month so that means its on the house
youre the only one thats nice to lemons like me mater
dont sweat it
these things happen to everybody otis
but you never leak oil
yeah but i aint perfect
dont tell nobody but i think my rust is starting to show through
mater and otis drive past the radiator springs welcome sign
it has been amended to say home of lightning mcqueen
hey is lightning mcqueen back yet
he must be crazy excited about winning his fourth piston cup
yeah were so dadgum proud of him
but i sure wish hed hurry up and get back cause we got a whole summers worth of best friend fun to make up for
just me and ahead of them a half mile off a red race car is visible
mater floors it dragging poor otis behind him
im in no hurry
you dont need to go so fast
they hit a bump
otis catches air
lightning mcqueen is surrounded by his hometown friends
good to have you back honey
welcome home soldier
the place wasnt the same without you son
did he go somewhere
its good to be home everybody
they all turn around see mater speeding into town with otis swerving behind him
mater skids into main street and in one swift motion slingshots otis forward woaahhhhh
right through ramones front door where he lands perfectly on the hydraulic lift
ramone lifts him up routine
how fard you make it this time otis
halfway to the county line
not bad man
i know i cant believe it either
mcqueen welcome back
mater its so good to see you
you too buddy
mater and mcqueen do an elaborate tire bump fist bump style
you aint gonna believe the things i got planned for us
everyone watches as the tire bump continues
to lizzie an aside these best friend greetings get longer every year
you ready to have some serious fun
well actually ive got something to show you first
close on the piston cup
it has now changed been adorned with a small likeness of doc
it says hudson hornet piston cup
i cant believe they renamed the piston cup after our very own doc hudson
mcqueen and mater are alone the museum closed to the public
mcqueen approaches a hudson hornet wall with docs three piston cups framed articles other racing ephemera
i know doc said these things were just old cups but to have someone else win it just didnt feel right you know
well doc wouldve been real proud of you
thats for sure
mcqueen takes this in
mcqueen and mater exit the doc hudson museum
ive been waiting all summer for this
whatve you got planned
you sure you can handle it
come on you know who youre talking to
this is lightning mcqueen
i can handle anything
mater and mcqueen roll on an old train track their tires off
theyre on their rims
just remember your brakes aint gonna work on these
as they head into a dark tunnel mater
relax these train tracks aint been used in years
from inside the tunnel a loud train horn
the two friends emerge going as fast as they can on train tracks uphill with no tires
come on come on
moments later a harmless galloping goose appears oversized horn visible cackling and laughing at his prank
an enormous earth mover sleeps
mcqueen and mater sneak up
this is gonna be good
they blow their horns and he tips over tractor tipping style
they laugh at the gag but soon realize the earth movers giant exhaust pipe is directly above them
this aint gonna be good
the exhaust pipe belches
mcqueen and mater are blasted out of view
the sun sets
mcqueen and mater roll into town
mcqueen looks exhausted
mater is still full of energy
boy this was the best day ever
and my favorite souvenir
mater proudly shows off a dent
this new dent
today was uh
shoot that was nothing
wait til you see what i got planned for tonight
i was kind of thinking of just a quiet dinner
thats exactly what i was thinking
i meant with sally mater
you me and miss sally going out for supper
mcqueen pulls around in front of mater stops
mater i meant it would be just me and sally
its just for tonight
well do whatever you want tomorrow
thanks for understanding
yall go on and have fun now
see ya soon amigo
mcqueen drives off
mater watches him go
its been converted into a white tablecloth restaurant with cars dining al fresco and a hopping gastropub inside
mcqueen and sally have a prime table with a view of radiator springs and the starry night sky
this is so nice
i cant tell you how good it is to be here alone
just the two of us
finally you and me good evening
mater is at their table dressed as a waiter
my name is mater and ill be your waiter
mater the waiter
thats funny right there
mater you work here
well yeah i work here
whatd you think i just snuck in here when nobody was looking and pretended to be your waiter just so i could hang out with you
mcqueen and sally exchange a look
how ridiculous would that be
now can i start you two lovebirds off with a couple drinks
ill have my usual
you know what
im going to have that too
inside at the bar fillmore and sarge watch as guido mixes drinks ala cocktail
whats mcqueens usual
in italian subtitled how should i know
give me two of em
my programs on
tonight on the mel dorado show
on the bar tv the mel dorado show a cable talk show begins with file footage of miles axlerod a sleek suv
his story gripped the world
oil billionaire miles axlerod in an attempt to become the first car to circumnavigate the globe without gps ironically ran out of gas and found himself trapped in the wild
we see images of newspaper headlines search crews
feared dead he emerged days later running on a fuel hed distilled himself from the natural elements
since then hes sold his oil fortune converted himself from a gas guzzler into an electric car and has devoted his life to finding a renewable clean burning fuel
images of oil derricks torn down miles axlerod getting converted to electric lab scientists testing chemicals
now he claims to have done it with his allinol
images of fields rivers vegetables and mountains all combining to form the allinol logo
and to show the world what his new superfuel can do hes created a racing competition like no other inviting the greatest champions from around the globe to battle in
the first ever world grand prix
welcome sir miles axlerod
sir miles axlerod arrives parks across from mels desk
thank you mel
it is very good to be here
now listen to me big oil
it costs a fortune
pollution is getting worse
i mean come on
its a fossil fuel
as in dead dinosaurs
and we all know what happened to them
alternative energy is the future
trust me mel after seeing allinol in action at the world grand prix nobody will ever go back to gasoline again
what happened to the dinosaurs now
and on satellite a world grand prix competitor and one of the fastest cars in the world francesco bernoulli
across the screen live from rome italy
we meet formula race car francesco bernoulli
it is an honor signore dorado
miles why not invite lightning mcqueen
mater collecting his drinks looks up half intrigued
of course we invited him
but apparently after a very long racing season he is taking some time off to rest
lightning mcqueen would not have a chance against francesco
mater doesnt like this
i can go over kilometers an hour
in miles that is like uh
way faster than mcqueen
lets go to the phones
baltimore maryland youre on the air
am i on
go ahead caller
lets go to radiator springs
youre on caller
yeah that italian feller you got on there cant talk that way about lightning mcqueen
hes the bestest race car in the whole wide world
fillmore and sarge look around
mater is visible in the back of the bar on an office phone
if he is how you say the bestest race car then why must he rest eh
cause he knows whats important
every now and then he prefers just to slow down enjoy life
ah you heard it
lightning mcqueen prefers to be slow
of course this is not news to francesco
when i want to go to sleep i watch one of his races
after two laps i am out cold
audible rxns from the bar
a crowd has been forming ever since mater started talking
that aint what i meant
mcqueen and sally they hear the commotion inside
hey whats going on over there
the bar sally and mcqueen push through the crowd see that theyre watching francesco on the television
oh its that italian formula car
his name is francesco bernoulli
no wonder theres a crowd
when sally says his name she enunciates each part as if italian were her mothers tongue
wait why do you know his name
and dont say it like that
its three syllables not ten
hes nice to look at
you know open wheeled and all
whats wrong with fenders
i thought you like my fenders
well let me tell you something else there mr
san francisco mater
mcqueen could drive circles around you
driving in circles is all he can do no
i mean yes
i mean he could beat you anywhere anytime any track
on mcqueen he looks at guido who gives a nod over to mater turned away from the crowd still on the phone
mel can we move on
francesco needs a caller who can provide a little more intellectual stimulation
like a dump truck
he doesnt like this at all
that shows what you know
dump trucks is dumb
suddenly mater is yanked from the booth and replaced by mcqueen
yeah hi this is lightning mcqueen
look i dont appreciate my best friend being insulted like that
that was your best friend
this is the difference between you and francesco
francesco knows how good he is
he does not need to surround himself with tow trucks to prove it
those are strong words from a car that is so fragile
he calls francesco fragile
not so fast mcqueen
not so fast
what is that your new motto
francesco goes ballistic in italian
they cut his mic
well this sounds like something that needs to be settled on the race course
what do you say lightning mcqueen
weve still got room for one more racer
well i would love to
the only thing is my crews off for the season so a sound o
mcqueen turns to see fillmore sarge and luigi flank a tablecloth which is hanging off the bar
ramone backs away having spray painted team lightning mcqueen on it
guido quickly uncorks three wine bottles
mcqueen turns back to the phone
you know what
they just got back
deal me in baby
the place erupts in cheers
moments later general excitement as mcqueen exits the phone booth where sally waits
off her look
i know i know
i just got back
but we wont be long and oh no dont worry about me
ive got enough to do here
maters going to have a blast though
off mcqueens silence youre bringing mater right
you never bring him to any of your races
mcqueen turns to the bar where mater privately tries their drinks hates it spits it back in the glass
just let him sit in the pits give him a headset
cmon itll be a thrill of a lifetime for him
your drinks sir
i didnt taste it
howd you like to come and see the world with me
you mean it
you got me into this thing
youre coming along
mcqueen is given a new paint job and headlights by ramone
mater now sporting a team mcqueen emblem seems psyched as well
an airport departures sign advertises the next flight tokyo japan
mater waves goodbye with his hook alongside mcqueen guido luigi fillmore and sarge as
the rest of radiator springs watches them board a plane
in the jet later
mcqueen and mater are the only ones awake watch an insane japanese game show
japan at night
a stylish tokyo cityscape of neon glamour scrolling billboards vending machines and high tech skyscrapers
inside a souvenir shop loaded with mcqueen toys mater and mcqueen enter
a tourist sees mcqueen and faints
a kabuki theater
team mcqueen watches a methodical dance
mater dressed in kabuki makeup arrives
he looks insane
a sumo match two suzuki samurai cars wrestle over a parking space
mater now in his element cheers
the montage ends on this high note as we cut to team mcqueen as they roll up the red carpet
press is held at bay behind ropes
world grand prix and allinol logos are strategically placed for maximum press exposure
racers are interviewed by press behind the red carpet ropes
team mcqueen enters via a second floor landing which overlooks a massive indoor party in a converted museum
as they roll down a ramp to the party they are awed
ferraris and tires
hey look at this
okay now mater remember best behavior
you got it buddy
hey whats that
he sees something peels away
hey mcqueen over here
its fellow racers jeff gorvette and lewis hamilton
mcqueen now has no choice but to let mater go
mater as he approaches a glass enclosed rock garden where a pitty rakes rocks with precision
he knocks on the glass with his hook
you done good
you got all the leaves
people turn at the noise hes making
mcqueen jeff and lewis
check out that tow truck
i wonder who that guys with
will you guys excuse me just for one little second
he zips over to maters side quickly pulls him out of sight
this isnt radiator springs
youre just realizing that
boy that jet lag really done a number on you
mater look things are different over here
which means maybe you should you know act a little different too
different than what
help me out here buddy
you need help
shoot why didnt you just say so
thats what a tow truck does
hey looky there its mr
francesco is visible across the room holding court
ill introduce you
already on his way look at me im helping you already
on francesco moments later
mater approaches giddy
san francisco id like you to meet lightning mcqueen
nice to meet you francesco
yeah nice to meet you too
you are very good looking
not as good as i thought but youre good
can i get a picture with you
anything for mcqueens friend
as mater poses for a photo with francesco miss sally is gonna flip when she sees this
shes lightning mcqueens girlfriend
shes a big fan of yours
hey she has good taste
maters prone to exaggeration
i wouldnt say shes a big fan
shes a huge fan
she goes on and on about your open wheels here
mentioning it once doesnt qualify as going on and on
francesco is familiar with this reaction to francesco
women respect a car that has nothing to hide
let us have a toast
mcqueen doesnt like where this is going covers
raising a drink i dedicate my win tomorrow
to miss sally
i already dedicated my win tomorrow to her
so if we both do it its really not so special
besides i dont have a drink
ill go get you one
you mind if i borrow a few bucks for one of them drinks
could kill him theyre free mater
well shoot what am i doing here
mater zips off
i should probably go keep an eye on him
see you at the race
mcqueen starts to leave
yes you will see francesco
but not like this
francesco does a so his rear end now faces mcqueen
you will see him like this as he drives away from you
francesco wears a bumper sticker that says ciao mcqueen
so you had one of those made up for all the racers
he rolls off
he is so getting beat tomorrow
lights caress the main stage where a crowd has formed
ladies and gentlecars
sir miles axlerod
miles axlerod drives through an infinity fountain appears
it is my absolute honor to introduce to you the competitors in the first ever world grand prix
on finn mcmissile
he appears from the shadows keeps a careful distance from the stage
he zeroes his gaze on the world grand prix tv cameras which roll catching miles axlerods speech for publicity and posterity
finns onboard computer analyzes each one compares to the photos we saw him snap on the oil platform
each one is not a match
his view is suddenly disrupted by a beautiful sports car
she approaches finn
meet holley shiftwell
a volkswagen karmann ghia has no radiator
thats because its air cooled
im agent shiftwell holley shiftwell from the tokyo station
i have a message from london
you must try the canapes on the mezzanine
he moves her onto an elevator
the doors close on them
so the lab boys analyzed the photo i sent
what did they learn about the camera
it appears to be a standard television camera
they said if you could get closer photos next time that would be great
this was londons message
oh no no
um the oil platforms you were on
turns out theyre sitting on the biggest oil reserve in the world
how did we miss that
theyd been scrambling everyones satellites
the americans actually discovered it just before you did
they placed an agent on that platform under deep cover
he was able to get a photo of the car whos running the entire operation
the doors open and they exit onto the mezzanine
who is it
has anyone seen the photo yet
no not yet
the american is here tonight to pass it to you
hell signal you when hes ready
finn suddenly stops cold
professor zundapp is visible below them
he talks with a few pacers and gremlins
finn quickly retreats into the shadows
holley follows suit
what is it
change of plan
youre meeting the american
those thugs down there were on the oil platform
if they see me the whole mission is compromised
im technical you see
im in diagnostics
im not a field agent
you are now
mater as he grabs a drink keeps moving
ill take one of them
he snatches it drops it in the back where we now see a large assortment of drinks balanced
never know which one mcqueenll have a hankering for
he approaches a sushi bar
hey what you got here thats free
how about that pistachio ice cream
he refers to wasabi of course
oh same ol same ol
whats up with you
that looks delicious
the chef starts to carve a small scoop aside for mater
uh a little more please
it is free right
the chef adds more keep it coming
a little more
come on lets go its free
youre getting there
the chef gives in
scoops a baseball sized ball out
there you go
now thats a scoop of ice cream
in japanese subtitles my condolences
miles axlerod hes now nearly done with his intros
and now our last competitor number lightning mcqueen
mcqueen approaches the microphone flashes his headlights
thank you so much for having us sir axlerod
i really look forward to racing
this is a great opportunity
oh the pleasure is all ours lightning
you and your team bring excellence and professionalism to this competition
as if on cue mater arrives with a piercing scream of pain
everyone turns as he charges head first toward the stage making a bee line for that fountain
somebody get me water
he laps up water from the fountain like a diabetic cat
miles axlerod is shocked
the crowd cant believe it
mater now sated approaches the mic
to the crowd whatever you do do not eat the free pistachio ice cream
it has turned
sir axlerod i can explain
this is mater
i know him
this is the bloke that called into the television show
youre the one i have to thank
no thank you
this trips been amazing
hes a little excited isnt he
tilt down to reveal a pool of oil beneath mater
but wait i
mcqueen quickly pulls mater aside out of earshot of miles axlerod and the others
mcqueen is beside himself
mater you have to get a hold of yourself
youre making a scene
but i never leak oil
go take care of yourself right now
mater drives off
he drives through the party frantic
excuse me leakin oil
wheres the bathroom
i gotta go
someone points mater down a hallway
he whips around the and stops
finds himself in front of two bathroom doors neither of which clearly indicate male or female
mater chooses one drives inside
a shriek is heard and mater zips out
he heads into the other door mater rolls in still holding it in like a kid
i never leak i never leak i never leak
he sees someone leaving a stall
he heads in
in the stall mater enters looks up
the stall is a complicated apparatus with buttons and lights
high tech japanese
it suddenly grabs mater hoists him up as if hes going to get an oil change
what in the a japanese style cartoon caricature appears on a tv monitor followed by images of waterfalls and rivers
hey that tickles
the caricature starts talking in japanese
suddenly water fires up underneath maters undercarriage goosing him
he freaks out
outside the stall with maters yells audible we see a gremlin enter furtive
suddenly inexplicably his frame breaks apart like an egg revealing an american muscle car underneath
the pieces of the gremlin disappear under him clearly his disguise
this is rod redline american agent
its time for the drop
holley rolls along by herself
her rearview monitor springs to life
the american has activated his tracking beacon
rod redline waiting at a sink feels a presence behind him
grem and acer have entered hesitate briefly when they see rod redline
rod redline careful slides a gun out of his tire
he is suddenly charged by the amcs rod spins around and gets a shot off but is slammed head first
a tight close quarters fight begins in the stall mater still trapped is now being scrubbed as if in a car wash
he is helpless
outside the stall rod is being pulverized
just when he scrambles away from one car the other one takes over
in the stall mater is mercifully released but when he backs out rod redline is thrown into maters stall door crunching it and sending mater back into the clutches of
the insane toilet
holley isolates the tracking beacons location in the party
oh youve got to be joking
whats the problem shiftwell
hes in the loo
so go in
i cant just go into the mens loo
time is of the essence shiftwell
rod redline is in bad shape
he backs away betrays a look of concern
hes in trouble here
acer burns rubber ready to finish him off
just as he shifts into drive maters stall door kicks open knocking acer out
mater jumps out face to face grem
out of breath whatever you do i would not go in there
the door swings shut revealing the pulverized acer
a gremlin and a pacer
rod redline now behind mater and sensing an opportunity here quickly produces a small device
to grem and acer no offense to your makes and models but you guys break down harder than my cousin betsy after she got left at the rod redline surreptitiously
attaches the device to maters undercarriage
as hes goosed altar
he spins around sees rod redline for the first time
are you okay
mater turns back to grem and acer
wed like to get to our private business here if you dont mind
dont let me get in the way of your private business
a little advice when you hear her giggle and see that waterfall you best press that green button
its to adjust the temperature
remember its in celsius not fahrenheit
get outta here
mater exits leaving rod redline to a now even angrier grem and acer
holley arrives at the door
she takes a breath is about to enter when mater exits
excuse me maam
he passes her expelling some exhaust in the process
holleys rearview tracking confirms that the device is on him
dadgum pistachio ice cream
this cannot be him
is he american
driving off to himself look out ladies
maters fittin to get funky
then its him
holley takes one more nervous breath quickly closes the distance between her and mater cuts him off
he is forced to stop
a volkswagen karmann ghia has no radiator
well of course it doesnt
thats cause its air cooled
im from the tokyo station course karmann ghias werent the only ones
besides the beetles you had your type squarebacks with the pancake motors
okay i get it and before both of them theres the type buses my buddy fillmores one of them
we should find somewhere more private
dont you think thats a little uh youre right
impossible to know which areas here are compromised
so when can i see you again
well lets see
tomorrow ill be out there at the races
well rendezvous then
mater returns to his team lost in thought
there you are
where have you been
whats a rendezvous
its like a date
mater whats going on
well whats going on is ive got me a date tomorrow
guido makes a crack in italian
guido dont believe you
well believe it
my new girlfriend just said so
hey there she is
mater points out holley whos within earshot
holley caught in plain view drives off
see ya tomorrow
guido makes another crack in italian
guido still dont believe you
an industrial dock outside of the city proper
rod redline dangles from a car magnet
hes been beaten up clings to consciousness
i gotta admit grem acer and a bunch of nasty looking troublemakers look up at rod amidst crates and shipping containers
you tricked us real good
and we dont like being tricked
rod redline laughs to himself
hey whats so funny
well you know i was just wearing a disguise
you guys are stuck looking like that
this doesnt help him
they drop him onto a treadmill lock him down
a container is wheeled forward and rod is plied with allinol brand gasoline
i hear this stuff is good for you
so you think
the professor emerges from the darkness behind rod
allinol by itself is good for you
zundapp hits a button and the treadmill starts rods wheels spinning at a high rate of speed
but after microscopic examination i have found that it has one small weakness
when hit with an electromagnetic pulse it becomes extremely dangerous
grem pushes a world grand prix camera the same one that was in the box back at the oil derrick
he points it at rod redline
for the camera
is that all you want
i got a whole act
you were very interested in this camera on the oil platform
now you will witness what it really does
whatever you say professor
acer pushes a tv monitor toward rod
on it surveillance footage from the party
clearly they were watching and recording him there
you talked up a lot of cars last night
which ones your associate
oh no im sorry
it was your sister
you know i cant tell them apart these days
could i start it now professor
fifty percent power
to rod redline this camera is actually an electromagnetic pulse emitter
re a girl on the tv what about her
did you give it to her
the allinol is now heating to a boil dramatically expanding causing the engine block to crack under the stress forcing oil into the combustion chamber
rod redlines engine starts to crack and break
re a guy on the tv how about him
you talk to him
to professor zundapp what do i care
i can replace an engine block
you may be able to but after full impact of the pulse unfortunately there will be nothing to replace
how about him
does he have it
the monitor reveals mater rolling out of the bathroom and down the hall
rod redline seeing this does the worlds most subtle double take
we caught it but theres no way anyone else in the room could have thats him
hes the one
roger that professor z
as grem turns up the machine even more the professor makes a call
we believe the infiltrator has passed along sensitive information
beat listening i will take care of it before any damage can be done
the professor hangs up turns to the room
the project is still on schedule
you will find this second agent zundapp kicks the cameras power into the red
and kill him
on the monitor with maters frozen image on the screen we see rod explode in the reflection
over television pre roll of japan japan
land of the rising sun
where ancient tradition meets modern technology
welcome to the inaugural running of the world grand prix
on our announcers as they introduce themselves im brent mustangburger here with racing legends darrell cartrip and david hobbscap
theres never been a competition like this before
shots of the pits as the racers fuel up
first allinol making its debut tonight as the required fuel for all these great champions
second the course itself and its like nothing weve ever seen
david how exactly does this competition work
well brent all three of these street courses are classic round the house racetracks
outlines of three race courses are shown
theyre labeled japan italy and england and are different in shape and size
this means that the lmp and formula cars should break out of the gate in spectacular fashion
shots of the racers as they weave up the track practicing
look for francesco bernoulli in particular to lead early
shots of francesco featured in an inset
and with a series of technical turns throughout more shots of the course now highlighting the tech turns
gt and touring cars like spains miguel camino should make up some ground but i doubt itll be enough to stop francesco from absolutely running away with it
woah now just hold your horsepower
youre forgetting the most important factor here
that early dirt track section of the course
the dirt is supposed to be the great equalizer in this race
graphics of the courses now isolate a stretch after the first couple turns label it dirt sections
french rally car raoul caroule is counting on a big boost headed through there
and dont forget lightning mcqueen
his mentor the hudson hornet was one of the greatest dirt track racers of all time
in my opinion mcqueen is the best all around racer in this competition
really darrell i think you need to clean your windshield
youre clearly not seeing this for what it is francescos race to lose
its time to find out
the racers are locking into the grid engines rev as everyone gets ready to go
everyones bright eyed and alert except for mcqueen who we find in the back of the grid
he closes his eyes
i am speed
a laugh o
mcqueen opens his eyes
francesco is next to him on the grid
you are speed
then francesco is triple speed
closes his eyes francesco
francesco likes this mcqueen
its really getting him into the zone
he is so getting beat today
the starting lights click down from red to yellow to green
the race begins
francesco quickly grabs the lead
hes pulling away within seconds
on pit row we track past as the various crew chiefs on their crash carts bark orders to their racers
we end on team mcqueen
no crew chief just a solid looking team
his suspension stats look good
tire pressure is excellent
hes got plenty of fuel
and hes awesome
the same view of mater but now through a telescopic display
reveal finn and holley watching from high above in a downtown office building behind reflective glass
why is he in the pits
hes so exposed
its his cover
one of the best ive seen too
look at the detail on that rust
it must have cost him a fortune
but why hasnt he contacted us yet
theres probably heat on him
right of course
hell signal us when he can
and then we find out whos behind all this
on the track various shots of the race through tokyo as francesco extends his lead and mcqueen attempts to make up ground
in mcqueens pit mater watches the monitors sees them approaching the dirt section
its time to make your move
get on the outside and show em what doc done taught you
ten four mater
on the track francesco hits the dirt section and loses all control
he slams to a halt his tires getting no traction
francesco is brought to a screeching halt
mcqueen skids into view turning right to go left passing francesco followed by other cars lightning mcqueen is the first to take advantage
and just like that folks francescos lead is left in the dust
nice call mater
keep it up
mcqueen now leads the pack zooming out of the dirt now starting to relax
man mcqueen looks happier than a rollbar at a demolition derby
the field of cars thunders into a tunnel
everyones jostling for position as we hit the asphalt again
francesco crests the hill in last place
he bites down determined then chases
francesco lost a lot of momentum in the dirt
hes got some serious work ahead of him if he wants to get back in this race
various shots of tokyo as the racers move through the rainbow bridge
bit by bit francesco ekes his way toward the front toward lightning mcqueen as we cut to a rooftop and a view through the wgp camera lens
grem and acer are manning this one
they focus it on the racers as they approach
it is time
on the track a racer miguel camino suddenly plumes with smoke and skids out
miguel camino has blown an engine
very unusual darrell
hes been so consistent all year
camino quickly pits passing mcqueens pit where mater is visible
on grem and acer watching from above
you gotta be kidding me
what is it
its that tow truck from the bathroom
the one from the bathroom
yeah the one the american agent passed the device to
what about him
what about him
hes in the pits
not for long
acer exits with purpose
on finn and holley still in their office hideaway
holleys onboard computer flashes an alert
i think ive got something
what is it
the pacer from the party last night
shes spotted acer moving swiftly forward
cross referencing with the photos from the oil derricks
his vin numbers match
anyone with him
he wont be alone
conducting analysis on the target
the computer finds more and more bad guy pacers and gremlins are in the crowd
hes not the only one here
and theyre all closing in on
we pan over to see its mater
finn where are you
hes gone leaving only an open window
get him out of the pits now
in mcqueens pit
a car whips by o
some of them fellers is really loud
can you hear me
get out of the pit now
do you hear me
mater realizes this girl has somehow broken into his radio
hey i know you
youre that girl from the party last night
you wanna do our date right now
on the track mcqueen boxes out francesco holds his slim lead but barely
guys a little too much chatter
lets keep this line clear
a racer behind mcqueen suddenly expels black smoke skids out of control
on grem laughing
that was clearly his handiwork
theres no time for messing about
youve got to get out of the pits
is there gonna be cable where you is so i can watch the rest of the race
on holley watching from the downtown building
youre running out of time
theyre coming shiftwell
yes i know
get him out of there
get out now
we cut back to mater
he gives in exits the pit
well all right but i usually like to have a proper detailing done before i meet a lady friend
he moves toward the back pit door is about to open it
outside the pits acer and another pacer approach mcqueens pit door on the other side
ready to pounce
the doors open finn holding a fire extinguisher
but youre dead
then this shouldnt hurt at all
he empties the extinguisher in their eyes speeds past
they try and follow but have been blinded
one of them crashes right into a cop
on finn already on the move along a side street
on holley tracking everything on a grid map
mater looks like pac man weaving through the streets as bad guys close in all around him
ive got him in the back alleys east of the garages
multiple assailants are closing in quickly
keep him moving
im on my way
on mater he turns a corner sees a flower shop
hey new lady friend
you like flowers
on the track mcqueen hearing this is taken aback
on mater slowing at the flower shop
dont go in anywhere
just keep moving
mcqueen drifts outside allowing francesco to slip past
grazie and arrivaderci
i cannot believe what i just saw brent
that was a bonehead move
you dont open up the inside like that
in the back alleys as mater moves on hes followed by pacers and gremlins
suddenly cables whip in front of them pulling over flower vending machines and sending the shops owners into a frenzy
they direct their attention to the amcs who try and explain
on finn admiring his handiwork as he appears
just as he turns to leave hes broadsided and pushed into a dark alley
in the alley finn finds himself boxed by two pacers and pushed toward acer who now holds a flame thrower
this time im gonna make sure you stay dead
he hits the flame
on another street mater clicks along still looking for holley
just as he passes the alley entrance where finn stares down death youre doing brilliantly
now just stay focused
you want me to head toward that ruckus
mater turns into the alley
dont go down that street
in the alley finn now nearly pushed completely into the flame thrower leaps into the air
he fights back using his wheels axle indeed his entire car frame as if he were human kicking and tossing and shooting his enemies
mater witnesses the whole thing
a live karate demonstration
on the track mcqueen now playing catch up again scowls
stop it mater
just sign off
in the back alley finn polishes off the amcs by firing a bullet into a gas main line causing an explosion that tosses acer through the air where he lands
in a noodle shops sign
on the track the end of the race is nigh theyre bumper to bumper as they approach the finish line
the formula car gets there first
francescos the winner mcqueens number two
in the alley finn heaves breaths surveys his damage
that was cool
hey can i get your autograph
mater approaches when a mass of race fans burst out a door momentarily blocking maters view of finn
once the fans have past finn has disappeared
hey whered he go
our rendezvous has been jeopardized
keep the device safe
well be in touch
dadgum did i miss our date
post race press conference
francesco is center stage
francesco over here
hey what was your strategy today
francesco needs no strategy its very simple
you start the race wait for lightning mcqueen to choke pass him then win
francesco always wins
mcqueen waiting in the wings rolls his eyes
he suddenly notices something o
its mater appearing from a side street moving toward the pits oblivious of the press conference
i gotta tell you dude
you were in trouble for awhile
that dirt track section had you crawling
as mcqueen sneaks away to truly crush ones dream you must first raise their hopes very high
in mcqueens pit garage mater looks around for everyone as mcqueen approaches
is the race over
you won right
mater why were you yelling things at me while i was racing
oh you thought
thats funny right there
nah see thats cause i seen these two fellers doing some sort of karate street performance
it was nutso
one of them even had a flamethrower a flamethrower
what are you talking about
i dont understand
where were you
going to meet my date
she started talking to me as a voice in my head telling me where to go what
wait a minute i didnt screw you up did i
i lost the race because of you
well im sorry
i didnt mean an imaginary girlfriend flamethrowers
this is exactly why i dont bring you along to these things
maybe if i i dont know talked to somebody and explained what happened i could help
i dont need your help
i dont want your help
hey there he is
the press finds mcqueen swarms him
mater is pushed backwards as the questions fly again
mcqueen you had it in the bag
yeah what happened
i made a mistake
but i can assure you it wont happen again
he takes this badly
we know what the problem is and weve taken care of it
over footage of francesco and various other highlights lightning mcqueen loses in the last lap to francesco bernoulli in the first race of the world grand prix and three count
em three cars flamed out leading some to suggest that their fuel allinol might be to blame
footage of miles axlerod speaking to an aggressive press
he must shout over the press
allinol is safe
alternative fuel is safe
there is no way my fuel caused these cars to flame out
in the tv studio darrell brent and david talk to camera
well the jury may still be out on whether allinol caused these accidents but one things for sure lightning mcqueen blew this race
off a frozen image of mcqueen crossing the finish line a look of severe consternation across his face team mcqueen cant be happy right now
mcqueens smiling face on a team mcqueen poster
reverse to reveal mater looking at it sadly
he drives on passing but not noticing grem and acer
at the security check moments later
cars take off their tires move through the metal detector
mater waits in line
a security car approaches mater
in japanese and english come with me please sir
but im gonna miss my plane
in the admirals lounge moments later
the security car leads mater inside
right this way
as they move past us the security car covertly drops a ball bearing which rolls into a corner
the ball bearing then sprouts mechanical legs tripods itself and irises out revealing itself to be a tiny camera
mater follows the security car in nervous
this is about my hook isnt it
i know i shouldve checked it but i cant really look its attached to me
the security car suddenly decloaks himself reveals himself to be finn mcmissile
hey i know you
youre that feller from the karate demonstration
i never properly introduced myself
who are you with
lets just say im triple a affiliated
you know i know some karate
i dont wanna brag or nothing but ive got me a black fan belt
finns rearview alarms
his camera has picked up grem and acer
theyve just entered the lounge are right around the corner
hey you wanna see some moves i made up
youre being followed
finn quickly turns fires a tiny glass cutting beetle at the window
as mater talks oblivious the beetle cuts out a round hole
this first one i can reach into a cars hood pull out his battery and show it to him before he stalls
i call it what i accidentally did to my friend luigi once
mater does his best worst karate moves as acer and grem turn the corner
there he is
the glass drops away leaving a car sized hole
eyes the clock look i probably ought to go
im about to miss my flight
finn hooks mater from behind
he yanks him forward ive taken care of that
and leaps out the window
finn pulls mater down hard onto the tarmac towing him away from the terminal
this is first class service
you dont even have to go through the terminal
acer and grem appear chasing them
mater who is facing backward as he is being pulled along faces them
theyre about a hundred yards back
your karate partners are back here
they kinda look like theyre trying to catch up
whatever you do dont stop
finn skids around whipping mater in a so that mater is now towing finn
grem produces a rocket lines up finn as his target
finn without hesitation fires a mini rolling jack
the jack drives itself toward grem anchors itself under his frame and flips him like a turtle but not before grem gets the rocket the rocket it flies toward mater
finn aims and launches a missile back
only hearing this is everything okay back there
finn its sid
im on approach
a gulfstream jet wings into view overhead
this is siddeley
mater looks up acer screeches into view up ahead dragging a long row of luggage carts in maters path attempting to create an accident
you remember that whole thing about me not stopping no matter what
just as it looks dire ratatatatatatat
siddeley descends hawklike fires bullets and blows the luggage carts sky high
mater and finn burst through them luggage now raining down from above
i knew i shouldve done carry on
thanks old boy
siddeley lands hard on the tarmac ahead of them
no time to stop he drops his back open revealing holley
hey doggone it
its my imaginary girlfriend
get in here
mater speeds up toward siddeleys ramp holley
boy i tell you what you really do want this first date dont ya
thats a no quit attitude right there
just as maters wheels touch the ramp bullets ping around him in a spray
siddeley is hit a tire blown
he yells in pain
hold on sid
siddeley peels off the runway onto the grass
a gunfight ensues between finn and acer
finn shoots acers tire blowing it and throwing him off course
acer careens out of control drives up and through a jet out the other side where he lands in an oil tanker
on siddeley hes headed toward the edge of the tarmac where the grass and runway meet water
he hits the gas his only hope
finn its now or never
finn brakes s and grabs the ramp just as siddeley gets air
mater the only thing not in the jet dangles and recedes from our view as siddeley climbs toward the clouds
as hes pulled in through the back hatch by the time you read this i will be safely on an airplane flying home
close on a handwritten er tire written
note in childish scrawl
we dont see all of it only a bit
maters voice o
begins the note with the first sentence but we dissolve into mcqueens voice
im so sorry for what i did
i dont want to be the cause of you losing any more races
i want you to go prove to the world what i already know that you are the greatest race car in the whole wide world
your best friend mater
mcqueen takes this in
i didnt really want him to leave
wait theres more here
please tell the hotel i didnt mean to order that movie
i thought it was just a preview and i didnt realize i was paying for it
thats funny right there to the others theres a few more pages of p
well at least i know if hes at home hell be safe
siddeley breaks through some cloud cover flies with purpose
a well appointed spy jet
various computers line the walls
now thats how i like to start the day
you never feel more alive than when youre almost dead
i hope that device didnt fall off
thats the closest i ever been to missing my flight
with a robotic arm holley grabs the the device that rod redline hid under mater
she yanks it out with a goose
still in one piece great
holley drops the device into a mainframe computer
it starts i gotta go to a doctor
i keep getting these sharp pains in my undercarriage
downloading the photo now
hey lemme introduce you two
this here is finn mcsomething or other
hes a first class vip airport whatchamacallit
and finn this heres my date
i never did get your name
oh yes sorry
the computer is done analyzing
the cabin lights dim
time to see whos behind all this
an image is blasted between the three of them
its of a photograph a complicated melange of metallic parts stuck together
to mater expectantly what is this
well thats one of the worst engines ever made
its an old aluminum v with a lucas electrical system and whitworth bolts
shoot them whitworth bolts is a pain tell you what
them aint metric they aint inches
yes ok right
but whos engine is this mater
well its kinda hard to tell from this picture aint it
but youre the one who took it
yes of course
a good agent gets what he can then gets out before hes killed
you mean like insurance agent like like a good neighbor mater is there
wait you mean secret agents
you guys is spies
holley in how many makes and models did this type of engine appear
holley has these stats in seconds
it was standard in seven models over a year period
at least cars were made with this engine
mater moves his seat forward through one part of the hologram so hes face to face with holley
and so nice
just pay attention
she moves the engine photo so its now blocking mater again
this seems like a dead end
if there were something in the photo that could narrow this down a bit id be a lot happier
you might not be happy but i bet this feller is
see how hes had most of his parts replaced
and see all them boxes over there
thems all original parts
they aint easy to come by
thats something we can track
holley drops her screen down
well done mater
i would never have seen that
i know of a black market parts dealer in paris a treacherous lowlife
but hes the only car in the world who can tell us whose engine this is
mater what would you say to setting up an informal task force on this one
you obviously have plenty of experience in the field
well yeah i live right next to one
thinks about it i dont know finn
i aint exactly been much help to anybody recently
youre helping me
but you know im just a tow truck right
and im just in the import export business
tout de suite
yeah two of them sweets for me too sid
you know i always wanted to be a spy
is there any other way
siddeley hits the juice they kick forward like a mule as we a montage of paris mater attempts to merge into roundabout traffic mimes annoy tourists at the eiffel tower
a painter works his magic on an unattractive couple a couple kisses on the most romantic spot in the world we might even catch
the charming low key introduction ends with a sweeping vista of pariss center from far away as we crane down into a dirty street in the st arrondissement
finn and holley drive along together as mater playing spy darts back and forth behind them from doorway to dumpster hiding out
hes having a ball
once were inside stay close
dont bother checking vin numbers for criminal records theyre all dodgy here
no vin scans
dont talk to anyone
dont look at anyone
and absolutely positively no idling
are we clear
were not here to go shopping
as finn and holley and mater turn the corner
what do you mean
why would i mater turns the corner and enters a massive les halles inspired parisian market filled with car parts
a tow trucks dream
parts for sale monsieur
parts for sale
mater rolls along impressed by the goods for sale
you gotta be kidding me theyve got everything here
look at them hoods
i could use a hood
mater continues on though heeding finns advice
sorry fellers i gotta go
mater now out of sight of finn and holley passes a darkened stall
he stops peers in
theres someone in there
what are you selling
it suddenly opens its headlights revealing
in french the mutant car pitches his wares to mater
mater freaks out speeds off terrified
a few car lengths ahead of mater
they roll along looking for
finn and holley recede into the shadows
in finns side mirror tomber a three wheeled parts dealer argues with a french customer
there you are
mater suddenly turns the corner sees finn and holley
man there are some great mater get back
tomber sees mater then notices finn reflected in a hubcap
finn and holley give chase
hey wait for me
tomber skidding away kicks a tent in finns way
holley quickly pivots right and disappears
where did she go
finn hot in pursuit leaps another obstacle and loses ground tomber who turns a corner and finds himself grill to grill with holley
he whips to the left but turns over rolling sideways and crashing to a stop
holley zaps him with electroshockers
finn suddenly arrives stops her
have you lost your mind
but i thought mater
this chap needs a tow
hook him up
moments later mater tows tomber following finn and holley
you rusty piece of junk get your dirty hook off me
finn throws open a door
cars scatter like cockroaches
to the cars allez
mater unhooks an angry tomber who spits in french
finn pulls the door down
as it latches tight electroshock
are you kidding me
this is her first field assignment she didnt know you were my informant
a rookie eh
i never liked new car smell
holley fumes with anger
tomber was doing to life in a moroccan impound the first time i saved him if i recall correctly
speaking of recalls youre getting up there in mileage arent you finn
alright we get it
you both know each other youre both old
holley shoots a holographic photo of the engine in front of tomber
there you go informant
tomber eyes the photo
he recoils unimpressed
that is the worst motor ever made
suddenly tomber narrows his gaze
that oil filter
those wheel bearings
do those parts look familiar tomber
i sold them
hes my best customer but he always does his business over the phone
i was always wondering why he needs so many parts
now i know
well a lemon needs parts
aint nothing truer than that
yeah you know
cars that dont ever work right
lemons is a tow trucks bread and butter
like them gremlins and pacers we run into at the party and the race and the airport
holley pull up the pictures from the oil platform
i want to know what other type of cars were out there
holley complies and suddenly photos of cars from the oil platform hang suspended in the air in front of them
there were hugos
mater are these cars considered lemons
is the popemobile catholic
everyone involved in this plot is one of historys biggest loser cars
holley refers to the engine photo which now rises forward as the prominent picture perhaps the only one in view
and theyre all taking their orders from the car behind this engine
this explains it
gremlin pacer hugo and trunkovs never get together
but theyre having a secret meeting in two days
wheres this meeting taking place
porto corsa italy
thats where the next race is
then theres a good chance our mystery engine will be there too
your chances are more than good
i just sent him a new clutch assembly yesterday
to porto corsa
holley contact stephenson and have him meet us at gare de lyon
stephenson a three car luxury bullet train speeds along a snow covered mountain in the dead of night its halogen headlight cutting through the darkness
it dips into a boy ill tell you what
that three wheeled feller had to be right about a big meeting
mater finn and holley scroll through surveillance style photos of traffic on an italian street
theyre in the front train car which doubles as a luxury seating area and intelligence command center
you never see this many lemons in one town
unless theres a swap meet or something
hey howd you get all them pictures
well i remotely reprogrammed porto corsas red light cameras to do recognition scans
wow not only is you the prettiest car i ever met but you the smartest too
thats a familiar sight
mater refers to a photo of victor hugo the hugo lemonhead being towed by an eastern european tow truck
a hugo being towed
but he looks absolutely perfect
they must be the heads of the lemon families
if i was rich and broke down every day id hire me to tow me around all the time too
weve got to infiltrate that meeting
its the only way to find out whos behind all this
hang on a minute
holley snaps maters picture temporarily blinding him
holley turns back to her monitor
maters face appears on screen
she quickly grafts it over the hugos tow trucks
good job miss shiftwell
holley isnt sure what surprises her more the compliment or how pleased it makes her
thank you finn
boy i sure wish my friends could see me now
a quaint italian piazza
a pristine maserati fountain complete with ancient trident looms in our view
luigi and guido roll into view
guido your eyes do not deceive you
we are in italy
we are home
sarge fillmore and mcqueen exit a wgp transport truck
which way to the hotel man
no friends of mine will stay in a hotel in my village
you will stay with my uncle topolino
uncle topolino a distinguished fiat topolino rolls forward
he greets them warmly with affectionate italian salutations as word of guido and luigis arrival spreads
the square fills with family and friends
a festive homecoming party
lights strung across the square
music and dancing
fillmore and sarge are at a dining table
how do they do it
these are the same ingredients as back home but it tastes so good
its organic man
lightning mcqueen rolls along the periphery of the square seems lost in thought
uncle topolino beckons mcqueen over
you look so down so low
is like you have flat tires
mama topolino a hefty italian grandmother pipes up a mile a minute then drives off now a car on a mission
she said you look like youre starving
that shes going to make you a big meal and fatten you up
no mama topolino please
you dont need to make a fuss
shes disappeared inside her kitchen
is a problem yes
between you and a friend
howd you know that
a wise car hears one word and understands two
mcqueen takes this in impressed
that and luigi told me
while mama cooks come and take a stroll with me
they amble forward uncle topolino setting the pace
i brought my friend mater along on the trip
and i told him he needed to act different that we werent in radiator springs
hes a close friend
hes my best friend
then why would you ask him to be someone else
mcqueen considers this a realization
what did i do
i said some things during our fight
you know back when guido and luigi used to work for me they would fight over everything
in the square guido dances with a girl
luigi suddenly cuts in
they begin to argue
they fight over what ferrari was the best ferrari which one of them look more like a ferrari
there were even some non ferrari fights
guido now lifts luigi cuts back in
so i tell them va bene
its okay to fight
everybody fights now and then especially best friends
mcqueen takes this in
seems to take some small comfort
but you gotta make up fast
mcqueens comfort quickly evaporates
no fight more important than friendship
guido and luigi now dance together with the girl and her friend who has just arrived
all having a great time
they dance past us crossing in front of mcqueen and uncle topolino
we stay with them
chi trova unamico trova un tesoro
what does that mean
whoever find a friend find a treasure
mama topolino drops a tray of food in front of mcqueen
on mcqueen distant taking all of this in lost in thought as in the background uncle topolino and mama topolino talk then argue then make up all in italian all
while we stay on mcqueens pensive face stephenson glides along all business
finn one hour to porto corsa
thank you stephenson
finn watches as holley attaches a new emergency light on maters roof
it looks exactly like his old one
that should just about do it
so mater its voice activated
but you know everythings voice activated these days
i thought you was supposed to be making me a disguise
disguise program initiated
a holographic disguise suddenly umbrellas out emitted from maters roof
it drops a clean cloaking image of the eastern european tow truck over mater
make me a german truck
mater suddenly wears lederhosen and a german hat
check it out
im wearing materhosen
make me a monster truck
hes transformed into dracula complete with fangs
i vant to siphon your gas
now make me a taco truck
a funny car
finn suddenly pushes a button stops the madness
the idea is to keep a low profile mater
mater chastened moves on
so i just go in pretend to be this truck
and leave the rest to us
now hold still
holley turns back to her work
the disguises cloaking is larger than mater
as a result holley must dial it back to fit his body
as she carefully calibrates the hologram i have to do the final fitting on your disguise
the d disguise is now flush with his frame but dents show through
thats no good
she deploys a bondo sprayer on a robotic arm moves it toward one of maters dents
mater pulls away
hey what are you doing
the disguise wont calibrate effectively without a smooth surface to graft onto
for a second there i thought you was trying to fix my dents
well then no thank you
i dont get them dents buffed pulled filled or painted by nobody
theyre way too valuable
your dents are valuable
i come by each one of them with my best friend lightning mcqueen
i dont fix these
i want to remember these dents forever
so you were being serious in paris
mcqueen isnt just part of your cover
friendships can be dangerous in our line of work mater
but my line of work is towing and salvage
and miss shiftwells is designing iphone apps
no i meant for real
i its okay
say no more
ill work around the dent
in the meantime
finn hits a button
the walls transform into a massive you look a little light on weapons
off maters rxn stephenson emerges loudly from a tunnel
he powers forward starts his descent into italy you are looking live at beautiful porto corsa italy on the italian riviera
what a magnificent setting for the second race of the world grand prix
over sweeping helicopter beauty shots
well brent they call this place the gem of the riviera and its easy to see why
a local fishing boat chugs through an idyllic waterway beneath bridges that connect hillside villas
with its secluded beaches and opulent casinos porto corsa truly is a playground for the wealthy
a long line of rich looking yachts in the harbor
and everyone whos anyone is here today
rich sports cars drive past pricey shops
from the ultra rich and super famous to world leaders and important dignitaries
the popemobile visible in a crowd drives through town
you arent kidding david
you cant do a three point turn around here without bumping into some celebrity
helicopter shot of the casino
welcome everyone to the second race of the world grand prix
mustangburger hobbscap and cartrip in the control booth
the big news continues to be allinol
sir miles axlerod spoke to the press earlier today to answer questions about its safety
footage of the press conference miles axlerod at a podium addresses the press throng
he looks a bit exasperated
an independent panel of scientists has determined that allinol is completely safe
there it is
so the race will go on folks
race graphics show francesco with points at the top of the race standings
but the question everyone is asking will the real lightning mcqueen show up today
on the track as the racers begin to get into position on the grid
well he better
talk about a home track advantage
francesco bernoulli grew up racing on this course
signore e signori in the pole position numero uno
the crowd is cheering already knows who this is
the italian crowd roars and chants for their hometown hero
to the crowd bellissima
thank you for your support
and your big mistake mcqueen
mcqueen missed this comment
he approaches his grid position lost in thought
in the secondo position
cheers not so thunderous obviously from the crowd
mcqueen doesnt seem to notice
in mcqueens pit his team exchanges looks worried
is everything okay
if youre worried about your fuel man dont
its perfectly safe
no guys i just really wish mater were here
francesco understands mcqueen
francesco parks next to him grinning
here it comes
whatve you got francesco
for famous race cars like francesco and well
you to be far away from home is not easy
i think you forgot the insulting part of that insult
is no insult
when francesco is away from home he misses his mama just like you miss your tow truck amico
gee i maybe misjudged you because thats exactly how i of course i am at home
and my mama is right here
francesco refers to his mama who sits in a special box in the crowd cheering him on blowing him kisses
dont worry mama
mcqueen is very sad
i will beat his cry baby bottom today
and theres the insult we were missing
shots of the racers making the first few turns through the city streets
we pan to the casino di porto corsa
the beaux arts style architecture towers atop a hill overlooks the course
a group of thuggish hugos ugly eastern european cars wait impatiently at the front
a limousine style car carrier rolls up to the roundabout
an esteemed elderly gremlin rolls past with a group of gremlin thugs who usher him into the casino
man those are some ugly cars
look like someone stole their trunks
the thugs all snicker
holley arrives sporting a decent italian accent
mio nonno my grandfather has broken down
if one of you would help i would be so thankful
ivan an eastern european tow truck the one holley and finn prepped mater to impersonate drives forward
sounds like you need some roadside assistance
she was talking to me ivan
no no dont fight over me
holley directs her interest toward ivan
signore tow truck per favore
mater he watches this from a safe hiding spot around a corner
get ready mater
finn at an outdoor cafe on the casino grounds
youre on any moment now
mater now looking a bit nervous
he backs out of sight
i dont know about this finn
what if i screw things up
just apply the same level of dedication youve been using to play the idiot tow truck and youll be fine
its just that them guys look pretty tough and wait did you say idiot
is that how you see me
thats how everyone sees you
isnt that the idea
i tell you thats the genius of it
no one realizes theyre being fooled because theyre too busy laughing at the fool
while finn talks mater takes this in
he catches his own reflection in a nearby window
seems to be seeing himself with new eyes
mater jumps at the sound turns in time to see ivan shocked unconscious by holleys zappers
why arent you in disguise
i uh come on theres no time
mater now disguised as ivan the tow truck approaches the hugos
another limo car carrier arrives
its the boss
he is coming
the carrier parks and the back opens
victor hugo waits
mater realizes victor is talking to him
he hops to it
ivan why do you insult me so by making me wait
mater now with victor hooked tows him in the front doors of the casino
on finn now joined in the cafe by holley who monitors everything and sees everything mater sees on her display
mcqueen and francesco battle for first place the racers are now making their way around the hairpin and headed downhill toward the casino bridge
cars play craps with fuzzy dice slot machines with odometers for jackpot numbers cigarette girls sell car items
air freshener antenna balls sparkplugs
on mater he tows victor
they are flanked on all four corners by hugo thugs ala a presidential motorcade
the largess of the interior design seems to finally snap mater out of his funk
wow this place looks like its made out of gold
the hugos on either side of mater exchange a look
thats because it is mater
now be careful what you say
why is that
what do you mean dont talk to you
more talking from holley which we cannot hear so you want me to stop talking to you
you are acting strange today ivan
i have no idea what youre talking about
a digital readout isolates the hugo and starts to scroll reams of information alongside
alexander hugo aka chop shop alex
in a wider shot we realize this display is invisible to all but mater
some of alexs other alias include alexander hu dont go and alexander the not so great
hey you got a lot of akas alex
but i guess that makes sense seeings how yous wanted in france germany the czech republic
cutting in to his mater
alexander hugo unaware of holleys interruption whispers to mater as they turn a corner
keep your voice down
youre gonna make me arrested
to the other hugos dont mess with ivan today
hes in a bad mood
holley hearing this cant believe it
hes so good
mater tows victor inside a private room where inside are the worlds worst cars including vladmir trunkov tubbs pacer and victor
there you are
come in come in
curby gremlin from detroit
its good to see you
now we can start
is the big boss here yet
no not yet
hes supposed to be here any minute
a door is thrown open o
everyone turns now silent
on the door it sits open
no one enters
the room of lemons watch nervous
on mater nervously watching too
here we go
a car finally appears
everyone looks disappointed
its just the professor
zundapp when is he coming
hes already here
monitors descend from the ceiling
on them an image of an engine the same bloody engine from the photo
but this is a live image
the car is being worked on
the voice is garbled scrambled
no way to determine who
i wish i could be with you on this very special day but
my clutch assembly broke
you know how it is
the lemons all nod in understanding
forget about it
we know how you feel
descramble that voice
already on it im trying
its too sophisticated
we are here to celebrate
today all your hard work pays off
the world turned their backs on cars like us
they stopped manufacturing us stopped making our parts
the only thing they havent stopped doing is laughing at us
theyve called us terrible names
on victor hugo
on tubbs pacer
curby gremlin junker beater wreck
and finally back on the monitor
but their insults just give us strength
because today my friends
the monitors switch to live race footage
that all ends
on the video screens carla velosos engine blows veloso swerves attempts to mitigate a crash theres smoke
on the casino bridge
its carla veloso the brazilian race car
she skids into a wall hard
what just happened
analyzing the data im working on it
the lemons are cheering
mater is freaked out
they laughed at us
but now its our turn to laugh back
another racer blows an engine
mater jumps again
as the racer smashes into the railing
its number nine nigel gearsley
embrace your inner lemon
let it drive you
im detecting an extremely strong electromagnetic pulse
holley replays that last crash
the outline of the beam is seen hitting the racer
holley traces this to its source a wgp camera which grem and acer have pointed at the racers from a tower position
finn its the camera
on the tower
finn takes off speeding toward grem and acer this was meant to be alternative fuels greatest moment
angry fans knock over cans of allinol
one drives over an allinol sign
theyre fed up with it
after today everyone will race back to gasoline
we rack focus to reveal another fan as he rips an allinol banner down angrily
the video screens are now filled with one image of the oil platforms in the pacific from the beginning of the movie
and we the owners of the worlds largest untapped oil reserve will become the most powerful cars in the world
finn ducks weaves speeds and pushes his way through get out of the way
he speeds furiously through town
mcqueen and francesco fly past us
they will come to us and they will have no choice cause they will need us
on finn he speeds up a road grem and acer visible ahead of him
he leaps over the crevasse toward the amc cousins suddenly finn freezes
hes immobilized in mid air
he looks up
a chopper with a large magnet hovers over him
we figured you might stop by
and they will finally respect us
so hold your hoods high
after today you will never again be ashamed of who you are
grem and acer turn back to the camera
they line up shu todoroki whos a bit further along now
long live lemons
grem zaps the racer
flames burst from todoroki
he loses control
number seven is loose
shu takes down three more cars with him and others follow suit
its a nightmare pileup
holley sees finn being flown away by the chopper
bumper to bumper as they approach the finish line
mcqueen noses out francesco for a win both oblivious to whats just happened
mcqueens the winner francescos second
and they have no idea what happened behind them
this is impossible
thats what im talking about
hey where are all the other cars
what is going on
they see the pile up from an overhead monitor
sirens blare as a medic chopper flies to the scene of the pile up
miles axlerod later
hes near the casino
hes completely surrounded degrees by press
hes drowned out by a blizzard of questions
is the final race in london still going to take place
pull back to reveal we are watching this on monitors in the private casino room with the lemonheads zundapp and mater
i suppose that
look the show must go on as they say
but now is not the time to talk about
i cant believe this is really happening
will you require all the racers to still run on allinol
here it comes
on miles axlerod hes devastated
i cannot in good conscience continue to risk the lives of any more race cars
the final race will not be run on allinol
wild whooping cheers fill the room
lemonade corks are popped
there you have it
a clearly devastated sir miles axlerod announcing that he will not require the cars to use allinol for the final race
to the death of allinol and alternative fuel forever
holley is already on the run
abort the mission
theyve got finn
get out of there
get out of there right now
she turns a corner and stops
her escape is now blocked by the same hugo thugs she tricked before
another vehicle appears behind her looms
how is your grandfather
the lemonheads celebrate chant long live lemons
mater scared turns to leave
hes stopped by alexander hugo
isnt this a great party ivan
oh yeah its unbelievable
you are not leaving are you
uh of course i aint leavin
im just in shock like everybody
he turns sees that mcqueen is being interviewed on the monitors
crashes are part of racing i know
but something like that shouldnt ever happen
theyre letting you choose your fuel for the final race
do you have any idea what its going to be
the excitement suddenly drains from the room
did he just say allinol
my friend fillmore says the fuels safe
thats good enough for me
i didnt stand by a friend of mine recently
im not gonna make the same mistake twice
he takes this in
so a surprising revelation from lightning mcqueen
zundapp is already on the phone with their big boss who based on his angry o
voice sounds ticked off
zundapp hangs up turns to the room
allinol must be finished for good
mcqueen cannot win the last race
lightning mcqueen must be killed
maters eyes open wide
mater backs up knocking his emergency light against one of the monitors
his holographic disguise flickers away then quickly scrolls through all of his previous disguises finally revealing rusty old mater
its the american spy
the thugs draw terrifying weapons
gatling gun request acknowledged
guns roll out of mater on each side
i didnt mean request acknowledged
mater sprays bullets into the crowd
the lemons and lemonheads hit the deck and return fire mater is thrown backward by the force of the guns back through some double doors and onto a balcony
i didnt mean that kind of shoot
a parachute bursts out of the back of mater he catches air and is yanked into the sky
the lemonheads watch him float away amazed
on mater out of the frying pan but still toasty
he looks around notices lightning mcqueen far away leaving the press podium
mater looks down at the harbor over which he flies
he spots a motorboat
mater whips his hook down steals a ride behind the boat toward mcqueen
the motorboat isnt happy about this tries to shake him
mater is thrown into a hotel sign then smashes down through a francesco souvenir stand
as he crashes onto the ground hard we smash cut to a barricade
separating the press from the public italian security trucks stand guard
mater barrels around a corner
hes now covered in francesco memorabilia and palm leaves
the word hot now dangles off him like the worlds biggest bling
he looks insane
you gotta let me in
i gotta get through to warn mcqueen
security eyes one another
this is serious
you cannot come through here
back up signore
into a walkie talkie we have a lunatic at gate nove
i was disguised as a tow truck to infiltrate this lemonhead meeting and my weapons system misinterperated what i was i repeat
lunatic at gate nove
mater spots mcqueen far off in the distance
just off the press stage mcqueen is led toward the exit
right this way signore
mcqueen looks up but can only see a sea of vehicles flashbulbs cameras tv trucks with those tall satellite antennae things that spindle toward the sky
back at the security barricade mater like a nimble running back dances around to avoid capture by security
back up sir
mater head fakes them and pushes through into the crowd oy
in the crowd mater shoves his way through
hes still far in the back
that really sounded like mater
on mater getting closer
mcqueen theyre gonna kill you
on mcqueen okay hes positive that was his friend but where is he
mcqueen spots a tow hook moving through the crowd toward him jaws like
mcqueen disappears into the press crowd
no no where are you going
mcqueen pushes through the press
mcqueen tracks the tow hook gets closer
he pushes through the last few vehicles mater im so glad to see you
im so sorr its not mater
its ivan the hugo thugs tow truck
i am a huge fan
oh im sorry
i thought i heard yes but that was me
i said you killed out there today
youre the best
i mean thanks
right this way signore now the press liaison and his assistants are pushing mcqueen back in the other direction as hes pulled away i really thought i heard my friend
as hes pulled away press and onlookers start to come between him and ivan who hasnt moved
in england youll be finished
at the finish line
ivan is now obscured again
the italian press being to swarm
please the world press is waiting
you come with me please
mcqueen is pulled back just as mater now bound and with his mouth taped is pulled away and thrown into the back of a transport vehicle
he lands hard on his side spits out his tape
let me go
you actually care about that race car
a pity you didnt warn him in time
as the doors close on mater phhhhhssssssttttttt
a thick noxious gas starts to fill the truck
on mater as the knockout gas works its magic
his eyes close
is that how you see me
thats how everyone sees you
i tell you thats the genius of it
fade in on mater back at the casino eyeing his reflection in the glass window
its the same moment from before except now we are watching it from a detached floating perspective
no one realizes theyre being fooled because theyre too busy laughing at the fool
in the kabuki theater in japan again from before
mater makes a spectacle of himself whooping and hollering in the stands with the face paint on
mcqueen fillmore guido luigi sarge and patrons eye mater embarrassed and angry
in the japanese museum the moment of mater banging on the zen rock gardens glass
except that now we see all sorts of disappointed and eyebrow raising reactions
you done good
you got all the leaves
check out that tow truck
i wonder who that guys with
will you guys excuse me just for one little second
we now reveal that this floating third person perspective is mater
hes inside his past watching it from others points of view
he doesnt like what he sees
on mater now at the sushi bar
now thats a scoop of ice cream
mater swallows the wasabi with one big bite
the sushi bar patrons blanch with revulsion at his wail
on the fountain as mater peels into full view of everyone else at the party
as mater laps up water from a fountain mater
all the racers with francesco front and center guffaw at mater
on mcqueen now scolding mater moments later
i never leak oil
mater you have to get a hold of yourself
youre making a scene
in mcqueens pit garage after the japanese race
wait a minute
i didnt screw you up did i
i lost the race because of you
maybe if i talked to somebody or i dont need your help
i dont want your help
now back at the party a moment we didnt see before but which presumably happened
mater is banging a ceremonial gong to the horror of japanese guests
bang a gong get it on
on the partygoers race cars party staff theyre all laughing at mater as mcqueens final words blend in making a listen this isnt radiator springs
this is exactly why i dont bring you along to these things
off the gong at the party to the gong of a clock
close on mater as he opens his eyes
all around him all he sees are giant pieces of mechanized holley and finn are here too strapped bumper to bumper in the divots of large clock movements
where are we
were in london mater
inside big bentley
the big hand finishes advancing one minute
suddenly mater drops quickly down toward whirring scary machinery
the chain yanks to a stop
mater instead of being feet from death is now
finn and holley are only a few clicks closer to being crushed themselves
the clock ticks to
this is all my fault
dont be a fool mater
but i am remember
you said so
when did i
mater i was complimenting you on what a good spy you are
im not a spy
this echoes throughout the clock
ive been trying to tell you that the whole time
i really am just a tow truck
finn and holley take this in
finn hes not joking
you were right finn
im a fool
and whats happened to mcqueen is cause im such a big one
this is all my fault
grem and acer arrive on a lift roll into view on a catwalk
good youre up
and just in time
professor z wanted you to have a front row seat for the death of lightning mcqueen
hes still alive
acer whips a sheet away revealing the wgp camera turns it toward the clock face
not for much longer
he pushes the camera through an open small window turns it toward the course
mater drops down again finn and holley click forward
big bentleys big hand clicks ahead another minute
but were a bit farther away from it than before
we came as soon as you called
sally flanked by red flo and ramone are in front of mcqueen and the rest of the team
i called to talk to mater
it never occurred to me that he wouldnt be there
sheriff is talking to scotland yard right now
and sarge is in touch with his friends in the british military
you just need to focus on the race
i know but sal with everything going on im not sure i should a horn o
someones entering the pit
everyone parts revealing miles axlerod
im sorry to interrupt
no no its all right
i just wanted to come down here and personally thank you
because after italy i was finished
and then you gave me one last shot
listen i and i probably shouldnt be saying this at all but
i hope you win today
show the world that theyve been wrong about allinol
mcqueen takes this in
he looks at sally
mater would want you to race
mcqueen francesco and the other racers peel out we pan up to reveal the lemonheads watching from a vip box
mcqueen leads francesco as they approach big bentley
here he comes
grem turns up the juice to the highest death inducing level
holley and finn watch helpless
mater closes his eyes
grem zaps mcqueen
mcqueen speeds past big bentley unharmed
oblivious to what was supposed to have just happened
zundapp suddenly squawks over the radio
i dont know professor
what did you do
i didnt do nothin
im talking to the professor theyre all talking at once and for a moment we cannot understand what is being said
you broke it
i understand sir
grem hangs up
whatd he say
we go to the backup plan
we snuck a bomb in mcqueens pit
the next time he makes a stop instead of saying ka chow hes gonna go ka boom
mater shudders upset
dont feel bad tow truck
you couldnt have saved him
you could have
grem and acer laugh
as they board the elevator dadgum lemons
suddenly maters gatling guns rotate out again a surprise to mater
but they spin in place empty
grem and acer just laugh more
what you didnt think wed take your bullets
mater notices something
close on what mater sees a small piece of his ropes have been shaved away by the gatling
he carefully rotates his guns back in pretending like hes seen nothing
you got nothin
as the elevator descends whos the lemon now huh
nice try mater
the guns rotate out again spin
mater watches as the spinning barrels slice into the ropes do some damage
the computer responds with each dadgum
the barrels continue to spin cutting through the ropes
the ropes break away and mater falls right toward the whirring machinery
mater quickly whips his tow cable around hooks a pipe and tosses himself to the ramp with a heavy thud
he doesnt i gotta get you all out of there
theres no time
mcqueen needs your help mater
but i cant im just a tow truck
its up to you
go to the pits and get everyone out
you can do that
what about you guys
well be okay
go and get some more dents mater
mater speeds out the front door a bat out of hell on finn and holley now closer to death
so well be okay
he wouldnt have left if id told him the truth
re his death trap being killed by a clock
gives a whole new meaning to your time has come
at this mention holley seems to perk up gets an idea
she spies a gearbox below them at least feet down
holley but they miss their target
she recoils them back
what are you doing
trying to turn back time
if i can just reverse the polarity
she fires them again
holley juices the gearbox with high voltage
the clock stops
it reverses itself
finn and holleys wheel now rotates away from danger
quick thinking holley
big bentley visible from street level now moves backwards
crane down to mater speeding toward the track unaware
whats everybody on the wrong side of the road for
finn and holley are now moving in the opposite direction toward another gear
and its going much faster
theyre seconds from a crushing death
they both drive fast as they can with full force burn rubber
they drive harder separating bumpers with just enough room for the descending gear to snap their ropes
their tires spinning they both launch off in opposite directions land hard on opposing platforms
as finn squeals around to holleys side of the clock weve got to get to the course
calculate the fastest way to holley pops wings out of her side
theyre standard issue now
you kids get all the good hardware
they turn to leave when they stop see something
its an air filter on the ground
i knew his escape was too easy
finn bursts out the front doors of big bentley speeds off as holley smashes through the clock face careens into view flying over the traffic mater bursts through the security
gate with aplomb tears through the pits and stops at mcqueens
everybody get out
get out now
yall gotta get out the pits
the entire radiator springs gang is here
hey what are you guys doing here
were here because of you mater
is everything okay
everythings not okay
theres a bomb in here
yall gotta get out
mater listen to me
the bomb is on you
on his rearview display we can see that a bomb has been detected anchored to maters air filter
they knew youd try to help mcqueen
when we were knocked out they planted it in your air filter
mater snorts blowing his air filter cover off
cross eyed mater sees the explosive device attached to him
he looks up an allinol container hangs ominously over his head
there you are
mcqueen enters pit row yards away and closing in fast
stop right there
oh man ive been so worried about you
the view of this scene through the window of a luxury box
reveal zundapp in the windows reflection
hes watching from inside
hes poised to push a detonator button
as zundapps front tire approaches the detonator
dont come any closer
are you okay
no im not okay
stay away from me
mater peels out backwards out onto the track
professor zundapp he hesitates cant believe it
a tow truck has just raced onto the track
and hes driving backwards
he breezes right through his pit goes after mater
normally an emergency vehicle on the track means theres been an accident
lightning mcqueen is chasing him
mater drives up the track
mcqueen gains fast
because maters going backwards theyre face to face but still with some distance between them
if you get close to me you gonna get hurt real bad
i know i made you feel that way before but none of that matters because were best friends
and mcqueen seems to be having a conversation with the tow truck
i dont know who that truck is brent
but ill tell you what hes gotta be the worlds best backwards driver
reveal zundapp is watching this footage from his luxury box
the closer mcqueen gets to mater the farther his tire rolls onto the detonator
but he holds back ever so slightly so as not to jump the gun
on the track mcqueen gains on mater
mcqueen you dont get it
im the bomb
you are the bomb
thats what im trying to say here
youve always been the bomb
and youll always be the bomb
he watches as mcqueen speeds up
hes had enough screwing around
here he comes
hes going to catch him now
get away again
mcqueen jumps forward in an attempt to grab maters hook gotta keep away from mcqueen
mcqueen hooks mater with his bumper just as request acknowledged
turbine rockets slide out of mater
oh my gosh
mater jolts forward with a rocket blast and disappears taking mcqueen with him
he now freely pushes the detonator but it says zundapp cant believe it
he flips out
farther up the track francesco speeds along
mater and mcqueen zing past him with a red blur
what is happening
its a bad dream
now even farther up the track mater takes a turn smashes through a fence and skids around a corner out of sight
a white smoky jet trail is all that remains
in mcqueens pit all of radiator springs watches the television monitors dumbfounded
and lightning mcqueen just blasted away hooked to the now rocket propelled tow truck
mater and mcqueen swerve through the streets
zundapp is still furiously hitting the button as holley drops into view just beyond the glass
freaked zundapp does a and smashes out a plate glass window lands on a ridiculously large balloon tethered to the ground and speeds off the lemonheads watch baffled as zundapp
the professors on the run
someones gotta get mcqueen
grem and acer are already out the door finn speeds into view in time to see zundapp turn a corner out of sight
ill get zundapp you help mater
holley still in the air turns got it
farther up the track holley thunders past francesco and out of sight
what is happening
finn screams around a corner sees professor zundapp speeding toward docks along the thames where a combat ship waits
on zundapp with finn gaining fast he accelerates
suddenly hes been tethered by finn with tensile cables now attached to his rear end
zundapp screams like a little girl
do you really think im going to let you float away professor
finn reels him in
zundapp spins his wheels caught
suddenly zundapp miraculously inconceivably gains traction
now its finns wheels that are spinning
on the combat ship the electromagnet has been turned outward and switched on
hes pulling zundapp and finn in with the magnetic force
he pulls out a laser targets it at finns windshield
mater still towing mcqueen rockets around a corner zips down another street mcqueen let go
they pass a gremlin with a headset
on grem and acer down another side street
they get this message take off in the opposite direction
finn tires squealing loses more and more ground to the boat
zundapp the rope in this tug of war buckles under the tension
give it up mcmissile
finn releases a mess of bullets grenades and other weaponry into the air
the magnet sucks it in quickly like a black hole thunk
it all sticks to the magnet right next to finns bullets
theyre bombs grenades rockets and one little detonator with a flashing beeping light
off the boats rxn ka boooooom
a distant explosion miles away festoons into the air visible over the rooftops
holley suddenly wings into view
she sees mater and mcqueen speeding up the street
you could get hurt
then she looks over catches a glimpse of grem and acer bearing down on them from a side street
theyre going to broadside mater and mcqueen
on mater and mcqueen theyre not aware of the impending impact
holley drops from the sky hits the pavement skids into the path of the amcs and deflects them
they flip over holley finn and mcqueen and sail where they skid across the room and slam into the bar knocking a row of beer mugs to the ground
grem and acer are pulverized by the bar patrons
holley mcqueen and mater are now stopped
mater weve got to get that bomb off you
shes already scanning the bomb working away
yeah they strapped it to me to kill you as a back up plan
back up plan
mater who put a bomb on you
professor zundapp suddenly rolls to a stop next to a now totally freaked mcqueen entangled in grappling hooks care finn who has him leashed
why didnt my death ray kill you
turn off the bomb zundapp
are you all so dense
its voice activated
everything is voice activated these days
the bomb suddenly transforms into a time bomb now complete with a countdown mechanism from
did i forget to mention that it can only be disarmed by the one who activated it
holley immediately shoves a gun in zundapps grill
the bombs timer it loses a full minute
goes from to to
i am not the one who activated it
would anyone else like to try
holley shocks him unconscious
you read my mind
he was getting on my nerves
what do we do
its very simple
victor hugo blocks the entrance to a side street
hes surrounded by hugo relatives
you blow up
the four streets surrounding them are now blocked by each of the lemonheads and their families
im gonna go out on a limb here
these are the guys that want me dead correct
its nothing personal
to the lemons fellers listen
i know what youre going through
everybodys been laughing at me my whole life too mcqueen turns to mater he wasnt expecting that
the lemons all eye each other considering maters words
but becoming powerful and rich beyond your wildest dreams aint gonna make you feel better
yeah but its worth a shot
hes broadsided by a blast of water from o
hes sitting outside an underground entrance followed by sally and the rest of the radiator springs gang
all out war ensues between the lemons radiator springs along with finn and holley
finn attaches his four way cable hooks to the thugs and springs high in the air crushing the four of them together
holley sprouts her wings and knocks out two cars on her side
guido pulls some lemon tires off with his air gun
in seconds he has a stack of lugnuts next to him
the two pacers tires all fall off
flo hits vladimir trunkov with her high beams blinding him
sheriff boots him
not today boys
guido pushes away his tireless thug yelling at him in mater karate chops lemons three and four at a time
ramone spray paints a lemons windshield
a few lemons turn back the way they came
blocking their path are a line of british military vehicles clad in digital camo led by sarge
thanks for the help corporal
anything for one of pops mates
and in the middle of all of this craziness we cut to mater
wrench bits are strewn all around him as guido tries wrench after wrench to take the bolts off
guido gestures wildly spits italian a mile a minute
whats he saying
none of his wrenches fit the bolts
this is a light bulb moment for mater
he eyes the bolts
i get it
i get it
i know what needs to be done
then do it
no i cant do it
look nobody takes me seriously
i know that now
this aint radiator springs
yes it is
mater looks at mcqueen
youre yourself in radiator springs
be yourself here
and if people arent taking you seriously then they need to change
i know that because i was wrong before
now you can do this
youre the bomb
no no no youre the actual bomb
now lets go
mater hooks mcqueen and theyre off
they shoot past finn whos in the middle of battling lemons
wheres he going
on mater and mcqueen flying down a side street
yes agent mater
i need that thing you done before to get me away from mcqueen
the rocket thrusters kick in
they head right for a wall
now i need you to do the chute the second kind not the first
maters chute pops open catching air and sending mater and mcqueen sailing into the air
mater starts to steer them the direction he wants
he and mcqueen are flying over london
the queen her attendants assorted dignitaries are here
whos winning the race
mater and mcqueen drop from the sky
they land and skid to a halt just before the queens guards who draw their weapons
its lightning mcqueen
no no its okay
tell them mater
somebodys been sabotaging the racers and hurting the cars and i know who
mater bows to the queen
in doing so the ticking time bomb angles into view
the clocks at t minus
its a bomb
hold your fire
he cant disarm it
finn dives onto the platform and rolls between the queen and mater
mater i dont know what youre doing but stand down now
aside to mcqueen this aint nothing at all like radiator springs
mater just cut to the chase
he turns to miles axlerod
youve got to be crazy
everyone exchanges confused looks including finn and holley
i figured it out when i realized you all attached this ticking time bomb with whitworth bolts
the same bolts that hold together that old british engine from the photograph
show that picture
holley projects the much discussed photo of the engine
and then i remembered what they say about old british engines if there aint no oil under em there aint no oil in em
what is he talking about
it was you leaking oil at the party in japan
you just blamed it on me
electric cars dont use oil you twit
then youre faking it
you didnt convert to no electric
we pop that hood we gonna see that engine from that picture right there
mater moves toward miles axlerod to pop his hood
this lorrys crazy
hes going to kill us all
miles axlerod backs up to the edge of the stage
but sir axlerod created the race mater
why would he want to hurt anyone
to make allinol look bad so everybodyd go back to using oil
i mean he said it himself with that disguised voice
dee sguised voice
what are you talking about
youre nuts you are
the queens guards have had enough
as has the prince
this is going nowhere fast
we really should go grandmother
id like to see where this is going
mater he created allinol
yeah but what if he found that huge oil field just as the world was trying to find something else
mater sticks his ticking bomb nose into miles axlerods grill
what if he came up with allinol just to make alternative fuel look bad
youre basing this on a what if
okay thats it
and the queens guards spirit the queen and prince wheeliam out of there fast
somebody save me
the lorrys crazy
now its just miles axlerod mater mcqueen finn and holley
miles axlerods back tires slip on the edge of the podium as he is cornered by mater
keep away you idiot
someone do something
everyone flinches ducks or dives for cover except mcqueen mater and axlerod youre insane you are
the bomb freezes at
have a nice day sir axlerod
general shock all around
miles axlerod realizes what hes done looks terrified
police surround him
mater flings miles axlerods hood open with his hook revealing an internal combustion engine oil dripping from all sides
it matches the photo
the engine from the photo
its a perfect match
how did the tow truck figure it out
youre coming to all my races from now on
now youre talking
a massive crowd packs the adjacent streets and parks
mater does the requisite silly faces in an attempt to break the composure of a buckingham palace guard
it isnt working
mater lets go
the queen sits in attention at the front of the main ballroom
as mater and mcqueen approach your majesty
may i present for the investiture of honorary knighthood of the british realm
tow mater of radiator springs
go get em buddy
mcqueen joins his friends from radiator springs
mater rolls forward
he bows as if hes practiced it all day
i hereby dub thee sir tow mater
applause from all around
shoot you can just call me mater your majesty
i dont wanna hear none of this sir business
by the way have yall met each other
he continues introducing everyone as we cut to the town sign now reads welcome to radiator springs home cars surround mater and mcqueen
the rest of the radiator springs gang is here too watches
van and minny are front and center
so there i was rocket jets going full blast mcqueen hanging on for dear life when suddenly them two nasty lemons come out of nowhere guns drawed
we was goners
but then out of nowhere this beautiful spy car swoops in from the sky to save us
thats a very entertaining story young man
oh minny please
come on none of this happened
flying spy cars
no youre quite right
it does sound a bit far fetched
the crowd turns sees holley wings out swooping in
finn is right below her driving up the street
its so nice to see you again
whatre you doing here
our satellites picked up an urgent communique
so you got my e mail
yall is gonna have a great time
this heres finn mcmissile
hes a secret agent
dont tell nobody
and this is holley shiftwell
shes im maters girlfriend
its so nice to meet you all
everyone is shocked
guidos jaw drops
guido believe you now
you got a nasty dent there
indeed holley still wears the dent from when she saved mater from grem and acer
already crushing on her was that from when you swooped in and saved them in london
im just asking
dont you worry sweet pea
my baby ramone can get that fixed up for you in no time
yeah sure thing
just let me go get my tools
oh no no
im keeping that dent
its way too valuable
mater takes this in
a valuable dent
oh shes as crazy as mater
those two are perfect for each other
you know theres one thing i still dont get
the bad guys hit me with the beam from the camera right
so why didnt i you know
explode in a fiery inferno
we couldnt figure that one out either
our investigation proved that allinol was actually gasoline
and miles axlerod engineered it so that when it got hit by the beam it would explode
wait a second
fillmore you said my fuel was safe
mcqueen turns to fillmore
if youre implying that i switched out that rotgut excuse for alternative fuel with my all natural sustainable organic biofuel just because i never trusted axlerod youre dead wrong man
it was him
once big oil always big oil
a banner says radiator springs grand prix
sheriff rolls up the street
the radiator springs grand prix is about to begin
all spectators clear the starting line
mcqueen heads up main street other racers following
man i cant wait to get rockin
this is gonna be wicked
yeah we should do this every year
i just figured we never found out who the worlds fastest car is
plus no press no trophy

mcqueen sees sally
he and francesco approach her
id like you to meet signorina sally

francesco turns to leave
as hes moving away

thats why i love you sally
as he leaves wish me luck

he drives off
flo approaches sally
that francesco is fine looking
and those open wheels
im gonna have to go get myself some coolant
the racers at the starting grid
on the traffic light in the center of town
it goes from red to green
the racers speed off tearing up main street and out of town blazing past tourists as the racers led by mcqueen and francesco take the wide sweeping turn around willys
butte we crane up to see mater finn holley and the radiator springs gang watching
holley gets an alert
finn time to go
siddeleys gassed geared and ready to fly
finn starts to back up
youre leaving already
weve got another mission mater
just stopped by here to pick something up
they both eye mater expectantly
something tells me youre not talking about souvenir bumper stickers
her majesty asked for you personally mater
but i told you all before
im not a spy
spy or not youre still the smartest most honest chap weve ever met
dont forget massively charming
mater looks over at holley
he looks touched
but as much fun as it was hanging with yall this
he looks over to his friends who watch the race cheer this is home
thats alright we understand
but ill be back
you still owe me that first date
if theres ever anything i can do for you just let me know
well i sure appreciate that thank you
there is one thing
mater blazing forward fast
he rockets forward through the whole town
in doing so he grabs a broken down otis hooking him whoa
and tossing him right into ramones
on the race track mater flies past all the racers including francesco impossible
until he approaches mcqueen
check it out
they let me keep the rockets
ill see you at the finish line buddy
not if i see you first
mcqueen and mater peel away from the rest of the racers lead them off the road and into the dirt for another lap
the two friends are side by side when we fade out
