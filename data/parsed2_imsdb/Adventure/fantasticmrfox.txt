written by roald dahl wes anderson noah baumbach march an apple tree stands alone at the top of a hill
a handsome fox dressed in an edwardian style navy velvet suit leans against it with his arms folded and his legs crossed chewing on a reed of wild grass
he holds an apple core in his paw
he spits out a seed
he looks off across a meadow that descends into the valley below
a female fox strides briskly up the hill
her coat is a paler especially beautiful shade of fox red and she wears mens trousers and a dark tunic
fox says as she approaches whatd the doctor say
supposedly its just a twenty four hour bug
he gave me some pills
i told you
you probably just ate some bad gristle
fox brushes the fur on mrs
foxs ears with his paws
they walk together along the crest of the hill to a fork in the path
fox points should we take the short cut or the scenic route
lets take the short cut
but the scenic route is so much prettier
ok lets take the scenic route
its actually slightly quicker anyway
fox throws his apple core away over his shoulder and dances a quick circle around mrs
fox wrapping his arm around her waist extravagantly and making her laugh as they start off down the scenic route
a rustic cottage surrounded by a small barn a tin silo and a rickity windmill
there is a sheep in a little pasture
a sign on a rail says berkus squab
fox and mrs
fox watch from the bushes outside a fence
what is a squab
you know what a squab is
its like a pigeon i suppose
anyway its a type of bird we can eat
fox motions toward the edge of the property
should we go through the hole under the horse fence or climb the rail over the bridle path
well i guess the horse fence would be a little safer
but the bridle path puts us out right next to the squab shack
she fiddles with her paws
she nods nervously
she shakes slightly
fox looks at her funny
ive never seen you like this
youre acting all skittish
ive been stealing birds for a living since before i could trot
ok lets take the no well do the horse fence
you gave me the scenic route already
fox flashes a smile
he says suddenly by the way you look unbelievably beautiful tonight
youre practically glowing
maybe its the lighting
fox is in fact glowing albeit ever so slightly
she stares at fox enigmatically
fox touches his paw to her cheek
note an alternate version of mrs
fox will be used for this shot which can be literally lit from within
with the speed grace and precision of athletes fox and mrs
fox dart through a hole under a painted fence race along a thin trail next to a garage crawl beneath a window where a blonde woman serves an early dinner
dealing hamburgers like playing cards to three little blond children creep past a doghouse where a golden retriever sleeps with an airline sleeping mask over his eyes and shimmy over a doorway outside a workshop where a blond bearded farmer hacks into a stump with a hatchet completely pulverizing it into sawdust
they arrive in front of a wooden shed
fox whistles sharply with a half chirp and performs a rapid reverse flip with a flourish
fox lifts a loose board
he looks to mrs
fox and puts his finger to his lips for her to be quiet
she shrugs impatiently
they duck inside
they come back out
each holds a dead bloody pigeon in his her teeth
they start to run away
fox looks up above them
he takes the pigeon out of his mouth and says curiously pointing toward the sky whats that
i think thats a fox trap
look at this
get away from there
is it spring loaded
pointing to different spots i guess if you come from over there and youre standing at the door to the squab shack this little gadget probably triggers the gesturing to
fox move out of the way darling
thats right where its going to land
fox runs back to fox and tugs at his arm
fox pulls on a little hanging wire
a chain unrolls rapidly from a pulley and a steel cage falls slap down on top of them
a small tag on the base of it says badoit et fils
fox and mrs
fox stand motionless side by side in disbelief
no it just falls straight down right here doesnt it
i guess its not spring loaded
sounds come from around the farm the dog barks doors open voices yell lights come on
fox turns to fox and says im pregnant
fox stares at mrs
he is confused but moved
were going to have a cub
honey thats great news
if were still alive tomorrow morning i want you to find another line of work
a wide shot of the entire valley
there are thick woods green and yellow fields two ponds a small village and a river running through the middle
years later fox years the entrance to a tunnel under a dirt mound covered with holly bushes
a small comfortable kitchen off a living room with two bedrooms behind it
fox sits at the kitchen table reading a newspaper called the gazette
his fur has gone grey at the temples and he now wears a dark double breasted pin striped suit with a conservative necktie
fox stands at the counter top stirring something in a bowl with a whisk
she is dressed in a paint splattered cream colored victorian style dress
a column in the newspaper with foxs picture at the top of it
the caption reads fox about town with fantastic mr
does anybody actually read my column
do your friends ever talk about it
in fact rabbits ex girlfriend just said to me last week i should read foxys column but they dont get the gazette
yelling into the next room ash
lets get cracking
why would they
its a rag sheet
i want to say i hate my job but that would make it seem more important to me than i want people to think it is
fox puts down her bowl and starts slicing a loaf of bread
a small narrow fox cub comes out of one of the bedrooms wearing white pants and no shirt
his hair is smashed all onto one side sticking up wrong
he is ash
youre not sick
i have a temperature
fox goes quickly over to ash and puts her paw to his forehead
you dont have a temperature
ash turns away and says as he goes back into his bedroom i dont want to go
youre going to be late
fox goes back into the kitchen and starts making toast and coffee
fox whispers to her i love the way you handled that
fox looks at fox sideways
she says loudly to ash your cousin kristoffersons coming first thing tomorrow morning
i want you to be extra nice to him because hes going through a very hard time right now ok
ash comes back out of his bedroom
he now wears a white cardigan and white socks with his white pants tucked into them
he says aggressively wheres he going to sleep
were going to make a bed for him in your room tonight
i cant spare the space
put him in dads study
fox says without looking up from his newspaper dads study is occupied by dad
ash goes back into his bedroom
fox lowers his newspaper
he looks around the room
he says to mrs
fox i dont want to live in a hole anymore
it makes me feel poor
fox stops buttering the toast
she looks to fox and says we are poor but were happy
fox twists his paw in the air indicating
comme ci comme ga
anyway the views are better above ground
she brings fox a plate of toast and a cup of coffee
fox takes her paw and says im seven non fox years old now
my father died at seven and a half
i dont want to live in a hole anymore and im going to do something about it
fox kisses mrs
he suddenly eats three slices of toast in a second and a half savagely but neatly
he stands and picks up his cup of coffee
well im off
fox throws back the last of his coffee kisses mrs
fox on the back of her neck grabs his briefcase tucks his newspaper under his arm and walks to the door
he shouts have a good day my darlings
ash comes out the bedroom again
he has now added a white cape to his ensemble and is in the middle of brushing his teeth
there is toothpaste all over his mouth
he waves briefly to fox and goes back into his bedroom
fox looks puzzled
whats he wearing
she smiles sadly and waves to fox
fox waves back
he starts to go out but pauses to look down at a folded up section of his newspaper
a clipping from the real estate section
there is a photograph of a wide sprawling beech tree at the top of a hill
a caption below it reads tree living great views classic beech a door opens into a wide low space with peeling paint
there is an old chair against the wall a bare light bulb hanging
from the ceiling and a layer of dust over everything
a skinny weasel in a khaki outfit immediately starts in as fox comes into the living room obviously its first growth indigenous
original dirt floor good bark skipping stone hearth weasel is interrupted by a loud banging clank
he and fox peer into the next room
a heavy set opossum with a cowlick tinkers with some pipes under the kitchen sink
he is kylie
weasel snaps at him whatd i tell you
im showing the property
youre not supposed to be here
checking his watch oh cuss
what time is it
he waves his arm in kylies direction and says distractedly slightly annoyed this is kylie
hes the super
aside to fix hes a little weasel makes a fluttering gesture with his paw
he points at a bucket on the floor next to kylie among bolts tools and washers
whats in the bucket mr
you want one
kylie reaches into his bucket and hands fox a live wriggling minnow
fox swallows it whole
fox stares out the window at three sprawling poultry compounds in the distance
black smoke pours out of a farmhouse chimney on each property
a sign on a water tower in the first compound reads boggis farms and has a picture of a chicken on it
a sign on a silo in the second compound reads bunce industries and has a picture of a goose on it
a sign on a windmill in the third compound reads bean inc
since and has a picture of a turkey with an apple on it
weasel says pointedly from across the room may i ask what you do for a living mr
foxs eyes narrow as he looks out entranced with his mouth slightly open
he says almost inaudibly i used to steal birds but now im a newspaper man
ive seen your by line
fox snaps out of his reverie and says suddenly good afternoon gentlemen
fox shakes hands abruptly with weasel and starts across the room
weasel is about to ask something when fox stops in the doorway looks back and says oh and kylie thank you for the minnow
it was superb
a beaver dam across a bend in a fast stream
a still pond sits above it
there is an entrance tunnel tucked beneath a rock
a large room of twig stick and mud construction
a card on the door reads badger beaver and stoat l
p attorneys at law
an anxious badger sits at his desk reviewing some documents
fox paces the floor with his hands clasped behind his back
dont buy this tree foxy
youre borrowing at nine and a half which stinks like cuss plus moving into the most dangerous neighborhood in the
country for someone of your type of species
youre exaggerating badger
im sugar coating it man
this is boggis bunce and bean
three of the meanest nastiest ugliest farmers in the history of this valley
an uneasy otter secretary peers in at them from the outer office
fox looks intrigued
tell me about them
he loosens his tie and settles in
a fat man with a huge moustache
he wears a tweed suit which stretches at the buttons so much that they look like they are about to snap off
he holds a carbine rifle
he stands in front of his farm which contains row upon row of chicken houses
he has an ugly face
he is boggis
walter boggis is a chicken farmer
probably the most successful in the world
boggis sits at a chopping block tearing into a boiled chicken with a fork and a meat cleaver
hes unbelievably fat which maybe is genetic but he also eats three boiled chickens smothered with dumplings every day for breakfast lunch supper and dessert
thats twelve in total per diem
furry black and white hairs grow out of it
a fly buzzes around lands on it and crawls inside
boggis sticks his pinky in after it and scratches
he never takes a bath as a result of which his ear holes are clogged with all kinds of muck and wax and bits of chewing gum and dead flies
and so on
a short overweight man with one slightly wandering eye
he wears overalls and a cap
he holds a twelve gauge shotgun
he stands in front of his farm which consists of several long buildings in rows like a factory
he has a nasty face
he is bunce
nathan bunce is a duck and goosefarmer
he owns about million ducksand geese
you might say hes kind ofa pot bellied dwarf of some kind
bunce stands up to his nose in water
the depth reads ft
hes so short his chin would probably be under water in the shallow end of any swimming pool on the planet
bunce sits on two stacked telephone books on a chair
he guts a dead goose cutting out its liver and mashing it with a fork
a plate of doughnuts cools on the table
he eats only doughnuts with smashed up goose livers injected into them
a tall skinny man in a long trench coat
he holds a luger pistol
he stands in front of his farm which is an apple orchard that stretches over thousands of acres
he has a mean face
he is bean
franklin bean is a turkey and apple farmer
he keeps his birds in an orchard
contd where they run around squawking and gobbling surrounded by apples
bean aims his luger and shoots a humming bird
crazy turkeys run about among the trees
bean works at a moonshine type cider still boiling chemicals and sipping from a bottle
hes probably anorexic because he never eats anything
hes on a liquid diet of strong alcoholic cider which he makes from his apples
hes as skinny as a pencil as smart as a whip and easily the biggest cusshole ive ever met in my life
fox and badger in badgers office
in summation i think you just got to not do it man
i understand what youre saying and your comments are valuable but im going to ignore your advice
badger leaps out of his chair and slams the office door
he points his finger at fox and screams the cuss you are
the cuss am i
fox jumps up and points back at badger screaming dont cussing point at me
are you cussing with me
do i look like im cussing with you
fox and badger begin to snarl and snap savagely knocking into the furniture as they circle around the room pointing in each others faces
suddenly they calm down all at once sighing deeply
one last thing somethings probably about to happen to me at work which i cant put my finger on but have a funny feeling about
how can i protect myself legally
are you about to get fired
a door with a frosted glass window
letters painted on it read gazette editor in chief phillip squirrel
foxs silhouette stands across from that of a small squirrel sitting at a desk
the squirrels silhouette says in a youre fired
slash i quit
heres my letter of resignation
foxs silhouette throws an envelope onto the squirrels desk
two muskrats in orange moving company uniforms unloads boxes and furniture from a wagon and carries them into the tree
fox holds open the front door and barks orders at them
two muskrats in white painters uniforms paints the walls of the living room and the trim around the windows with rollers and brushes
fox stands on the drop cloth and barks orders at them
two muskrats in blue electricians uniforms work in the kitchen
fox watches over their shoulders and barks orders at them
fox holds up a pair of flowered curtains in front of a window
he looks to mrs
she stares at the curtains thoughtfully
she raises an eyebrow
fox and mrs
fox sit in the windowsill looking out at the sunset
ash stands in between them
the flowered curtains wave in the breeze
fox puffs on a pipe
ash blows a soap bubble
fox puts out her paw and a butterfly lands on it
she smiles at fox
he puts his arm around her
he raises a pair of binoculars to his eyes
a binocular shot of an industrial shack with boggis chicken house stencilled on the front of it
fox lowers the binoculars
his eyes sparkle
ash stands poised on a high branch over an inflatable swimming pool printed with a red tartan plaid pattern
he wears over sized swim trunks with a pattern of acorns printed on them
fox sits in the grass eating an apple below with mrs
she is painting at an easel
ash yells watch this dad
fox looks up
ash leaps into the air and does a spectacularly awkward back flip during which he appears to have four arms and three legs randomly attached to his body flailing wildly
he hits the water by the side of his head and smacks into the surface back first with a pained yelp
he claps mildly
note an alternate version of ash with four arms and three legs randomly attached to his body will be used for this stunt
good jump ash
remember to keep your tail tucked
fox looks at mrs
it is a picture of the pond and landscape in severe weather with black clouds and lightning bolts
it is signed felicity fox
fox raises an eyebrow
still painting thunderstorms i see
fox sees a small samsonite suitcase on the ground next to a pair of yellow sneakers
whose suitcase is that
a boys voice shouts from the high tree branch hello everyone
fox and ash look up surprised
a second fox cub stands poised on the edge of the limb
he is taller leaner sleeker and it is immediately apparent even by his posture infinitely more graceful than ash
he is kristofferson
he wears a professional speedo with a patch on it that says swim team
welcome to our little tree
i see you brought your swimming trunks
kristofferson steps off the branch and performs a reserved but perfect jack knife
he enters the water splashlessly
fox leaps to his feet applauding with his paws above his head whistling and hollering look at that
this kids a natural
im speechless kristofferson
kristofferson smiles modestly and shrugs
ash stares at him stonily
fox turns to mrs
plus he knows karate
fox sits in his armchair reading the gazette
ash sits on a braided rug on the floor beside him reading a comic book called the adventures of white cape
on the cover there is a picture of a ferret leaping off a motorcycle
fox is in the kitchen in the background flattening a hunk of dough with a rolling pin
kristofferson is in the next room practicing tae kwon do
he wears khaki shorts yellow sneakers and a blue short sleeved button down shirt
do you think im an athlete
without looking up what are you talking about
well you know i think im an athlete and sometimes i feel like you guys dont see me that way
whats the sub text here
ash thinks for a minute
he looks at kristofferson in the next room
kristofferson is now sitting indian style on the floor meditating
his paws are turned upward with his thumbs touching his index fingers forming a ring
ash says loudly to mrs
fox in the kitchen how long is kristofferson supposed to stay with us
until your uncle gets better
right but roughly how long do we plan to give him on that
double pneumonia isnt even really that big of a deal is it
in the background kristofferson stands up again and starts practicing violent karate kicks
fox leans into the doorway and whispers forcefully as a matter of fact it is
hes lucky to be alive
now right but kristofferson yells suddenly as he does a spinning double kick with a chop ki ya
everyone looks startled
kristofferson resumes his tae kwon do practice with an angry wounded look on his face
lower your voice ash
fox and kylie sit in a porch swing on one of the middle branches of foxs tree
they drink cups of coffee
kids are crazy arent they
you got to try it though
raising a family
sometimes i feel like maybe i what do you think of this tree by the way
its great huh
no i was just saying how some i have one last part of what i was about to say
im going broke
you want to help me steal some chickens
foxs study the next morning
a map of the valley with notes and arrows written all over it is spread across a desk
the door is closed with a towel jammed under it
a cricket match plays loudly on the radio
fox sits in his armchair
kylie sits in a creaky rocking chair
i used to do this professionally and i was very successful at it
i had to get out of it for personal reasons but ive decided to secretly quit my job slash got fired to pursue it again
im bringing you in as my secretary and personal assistant
this is actually kind of a big deal so dont just say ok
well thank you
clearing is throat im going totape this formyrecords so dont make a lot of sounds meaning stop rocking
well maybe we ought to turn off the radio then
thats noisier than i dont want people to eavesdrop on us kylie
let me just tell this
kylie stops rocking
fox presses record on a tape recorder
fox stands on a rock at the edge of the woods looking through his binoculars
he lowers them and gives a hand signal
kylie joins him and they start out along the moonlit ridge
fox wears a dark car coat and a black cap
kylie has on a navy ski hat
well start with boggis chicken house
his only security is a few old hunting beagles and a low stone wall
now a word about beagles never look a beagle directly in the eye
and if why not
fox and kylie in foxs study earlier that afternoon
kylie beagles arent so tough
well first of all one of these beagles has chronic rabies which hes on medication for and if you get bit by him you have to get shots in your
stomach for six months
and second listen im not going to justify this to you
just pay attention and stop interrupting me
im taping this
fox and kylie shimmy down a steep embankment and cross a stream
i picked some blueberries butterflied them with a scalpel and laced each one with ten milligrams of high potency sleeping powder
foxs paws meticulously sprinkle a powdered mickey into a dissected blueberry and stitch it shut with red thread
enough to tranquilize a charging gorilla
fox and kylie in foxs study earlier that afternoon
they now smoke pipes
how do we make them eat it
smiling with utter certainty beagles love blueberries
fox and kylie push through a bramble and climb to the top of an elderberry bush
fox looks through his binoculars
if we approach with the wind in our faces well smell the chicken livers on boggis breath from at least fifty yards away
seventy five chickens stand around quietly but anxiously darting wildly nervous looks at one another
they eat bits of grain off the ground
remember they arent very smart but theyre incredibly paranoid so always kill a chicken in one bite
fox and kylie in foxs study earlier that afternoon
they now drink whiskey sours
fox repeats one bite get it
fox waits for kylie to respond
kylie does not
are you listening to me
i look into your eyes and i cant tell whether youre getting anything im saying
kylie stares at fox vacantly
note an alternate set of eyeballs will be used for any shots indicating kylies vacant look
fox and kylie move swiftly through the tall grass
fox pauses to sniff the air
a few beagles as we discussed but were ready for that
fox and kylie cross a dirt lane and come out of a shallow ditch
fox licks the pinky of his paw and holds it up in the air
you feel that
the winds in our faces
kylie touches his face with his paw
fox and kylie run along the edge of the ditch
kylie says casually yeah back in the old days didnt they used to do a thing where if somebody saw a wolf and what wolf
fox stops in his tracks
his eyes dart about
kylie looks at him curiously
fox and kylie veer off into shorter grasses
fox points ahead regaining his composure here comes the low stone wall
not a problem
fox and kylie climb over a low stone wall and find themselves at the base of a chain link fence eleven feet high
this is a chain link fence i guess
did i not remember this
maybe its new
what the cuss
whered this giant fence come from
we had a master plan
kylie motions to a yellow plywood lightning bolt posted to the fence
whats this lightning bolt stand for
give me a second
i said lets pause
fox pulls himself together
he turns to look at the plywood lightning bolt
that i guess hypothetically could mean maybe this fence might be electric
well i just hope it doesnt mean thunder
i have a phobia of that
fox and kylie climb a tree and crouch at the end of one of its branches
fox produces a zip loc bag filled with blueberries with white thread stitched into them
fox puts a blueberry into the end of a straw and shoots it out into the barnyard
the blueberry landing on the ground in front of chicken house
a beagle approaches it and sniffs at it
he eats it
he looks very pleased
he falls over out cold
fox with an ecstatic expression on his face
he rapidly shoots more and more blueberries across the barnyard
beagles eat blueberries and fall over one after another
fox and kylie drop down into the barnyard and head for chicken house
fox whispers excitedly as they run beagles love blueberries
didnt i tell you
the master plans working again
kylie raises his fist enthusiastically and trips over an unconscious beagle
he picks himself up quickly and they weave among the rest of the beagles
they reach the entrance to the chicken house open the door and duck inside
there is an eruption of crazed squawking screaming and fighting from inside
the chicken house rumbles
lights jolt on across the compound
an alarm goes off
the chicken house door swings open again and fox and kylie emerge among a cloud of feathers
fox carries two dead chickens and kylie has one live one
fox yells i said one bite cuss it
i have a different kind of teeth from you
im an opossum
kylie tries to bite the chicken on the neck
the chicken is unharmed
fox kills the chicken with one quick flick of the jaws
kylie looks horrified
thats so grisly
theres blood and everything
were killing chickens
theres going to be blood in this story
fox and kylie dash to the electric fence
they stop in front of it
kylie looks to fox
whats the master escape plan
fox hesitates confused
a gunshot fires from among the chicken houses
fox shouts to kylie follow me again
fox and kylie run back across the barnyard past the beagles as they begin to wake up and stagger around
farmhands appear loading shotguns and running into the confusion
fox and kylie race by unnoticed among them
they dart into the house through a flap in the back door
the lights are out in the kitchen
they take a moment breathing hard in the darkness
kylie shakes his head in disbelief
that was amazing
how did we do that
we ran the other way or something
what happens now
i have no idea
fox opens the door flap a crack
he looks out and sees boggis opening the front gate to let out his beagles and farmhands barking and shooting as they search for the intruders
fox shouts to kylie
they opened the gate
follow me again
lightning quick fox and kylie burst out through the door flap race across the barnyard and dart through the open gate
up the road boggis screams furiously as he runs with his pack of beagles and farmhands
fox and kylie fly into the bushes
as they race through the underbrush fox says lets hit the five and dime on the way home
we need to make some fake price tags and wrap these chickens in wax paper so it looks like we got them at the butcher shop
fox and kylie howl ecstatically
a foxs paw lifts a silver dome off a perfectly roasted chicken with an apple in its mouth
fox and mrs
fox sit at a candle lit table eating chicken and drinking wine
ash kristofferson and kylie sit at a slightly miniature table eating chicken and drinking milk
fox laughs hysterically as he tells his wife a story
wine comes out of his nose
fox and kylie dash out the door of boggis chicken house carrying three more dead chickens
lights jolt on
farmhands run out firing shotguns
fox and kylie escape through a hole cut into the electric fence
fox and kylie dash out the window of bunces poultry barn c carrying two dead ducks and a goose
farmhands run out firing pistols
fox and kylie escape through a hole knocked into a brick wall
fox and kylie dash out the gates of beans apple orchard xii carrying two dead turkeys and a basket of apples
automatic doors close
farmhands run out firing rifles
fox and kylie escape through a hole chopped into a burning barricade
fox and kylie run full speed through a clover field in the dark
the camera zooms in slowly on their faces as they ford a stream leap a fallen hawthorn and cross into the willow glade
they look exhilarated
fox studies a crayon price tag labelled attached to a wax paper wrapped parcel
she opens the parcel and holds up a dead chicken by the leg
there is a small metal clip around its ankle
she examines it
fox comes in grabs an apple out of a bowl and starts back out of the room
whered you get this chicken
i picked it up at the five and dime last night on my way back from its got a boggis farms tag around its ankle
mustve escaped from there before i bought it
ash kristofferson and kylie sit at the childrens table eating dinner
next to ash there is a small slightly beaten up statue of a fox with his front legs raised in the air holding a medal above his head
kylie points at it
just some old trophy i won for being an athlete
fox and mrs
fox sit at the adults table
fox guzzles down a last sip of wine and says with his mouth full of food im supposed to cover this book party at some animals nest in a tobacco
field down the hill so me and kylie are going to hop over there and give it a whirl
dont wait up
fox pulls his napkin out of his collar drops it on the table and stands up
fox asks cooly
whats the book
ill get him to sign you a copy
fox kisses mrs
fox on the cheek
she looks at him suspiciously
dinner was doing a little gesture pitch perfect
fox and kylie walk among the trees
they are dressed in their prowling outfits
i spotted a couple of broken burglar bars underneath the back door to beans secret cider cellar
were breaking into beans house
where he lives
where he keeps the cider
below where he lives
ash dressed in his own prowling outfit is walking with fox and kylie
fox stops short whered you come from
go back to the tree and do your homework
i want to help you steal some cider
were going to a book party
and keep your mouth shut about any cider because no one ever said that
get out of here
but dad but nothing
youre going to get me in a lot of trouble
the three animals stand in silence for a minute
fox points to his tree
ash turns and starts back home
fox shakes his head
where the cuss does that kid get off
can you believe that
howd he get tipped off
you think hes going to tell on us
fox turns to kylie
kylie looks back at him vacantly
before we go any further from now on can you give me some kind of signal once in a while just so i know any of this is getting through
kylie makes a slight motion with his paw
was that it
fox and kylie dart across the yard and around the back of beans farmhouse
kylie whispers as they run one time this wolf whats with all the wolf talk
can we give it a rest for once
fox climbs onto a garbage pail and pulls open a window shutter
he and kylie shimmy in between two bent burglar bars
a vast damp gloomy cellar with hundreds of glass jars stacked from floor to ceiling
each jar is marked cider
fox and kylie come inside and quietly drop to the brick floor
look at all this apple juice
we didnt come here for apple juice
this is some of the strongest finest alcoholic cider money can buy or that can even be stolen
it burns in your throat boils in your stomach and tastes almost exactly like pure melted gold
lets crack open one these shine jars and do a shooter
a match strikes in the darkness
fox and kylie look around the room frantically
on the highest shelf peering out from behind a huge jar they see an enormous rat in a striped shirt with a lit match in his claw
he puts the flame in his mouth to snuff it out and holds the matchstick in his teeth
he is longer than a fox and wiry but with a small pot belly
he wears a black beret and moves like a beatnik
he takes a draw from a small rubber tube inserted in the neck of his cider jar
he says with a slightly sinister new yall are trespassin now
round these parts we dont take kindly to cider poachers
fox and rat stare at each other
fox says finally youve aged badly rat
youre gettin a little long in the tooth yourself partner
rat spins around and hurls himself scuttling over a shelf down the wall and through the air onto the brick floor at foxs feet
he flicks open a switchblade and brandishes it
kylie shrieks and darts into a hole where a brick is missing in the wall
fox takes an old fashioned boxing stance
hows your old lady doin
kylie peers out from his hole in the wall nervously
fox and rat circle each other slowly
do you refer to my wife
she was the town tart in her day
wild and foot loose and pretty as a mink stole
she was a creme brulee until you made an honest woman out of her mr
kylie says intrigued from his hole is that true
of course not
i mean certainly she lived
we all did
it was a different time
lets not use a double standard
she marched against the but town tart
rat lunges at fox with his switchblade
fox dodges nimbly
he cocks an eyebrow and smiles that was close rat
oh im as careful as a a door at the top of the stairs opens suddenly with a loud creak
rat and fox look terrified
they both dart away and hide behind cider jars
a heavy set middle aged housekeeper carrying a rolling pin comes down the stairs and walks straight over to the shelf where fox is hiding
how many jars should i bring up maam
a strong almost masculine womans voice answers from i dont know
two i guess
the housekeeper grabs the two jars directly next to the one fox is hiding behind and tucks them under her arm
fox tenses his body
he shivers slightly
a graze of the red fur of his arm sticks out barely from behind his jar
the housekeeper hesitates
he drank three yesterday maam
all right take three
the housekeeper grabs foxs jar
fox closes his eyes
the housekeeper stops with her hand on the neck of foxs jar
threes too many
the housekeeper lets go of foxs jar
fox relaxes slightly
the housekeeper grabs foxs jar again
fox tenses up
but maybe just in case twos plenty
the housekeeper lets go of foxs jar and walks away
she goes back up the stairs and closes the door
kylie says in the oh my cuss
that was like a scene out of the door opens again
an exceptionally tall powerfully built woman in a black dress and wellingtons with grey hair pulled back in a bun bright green eyes and a meat cleaver tucked under her
apron strings comes swiftly down the stairs
eyeballs the corners of the room
she is mrs
she says thickly in her masculine voice to whom it may concern if i catch a rat in a black beret drinking mr
beans secret cider without his express permission i intend to chop said rats head off brine it pickle it and bake it in a vermin casserole
i hope this clarifies my position on the matter
sincerely evelyn bean
bean turns and goes back up the stairs
she closes the door
rats voice says from the shadows dear mrs
bean your language while somewhat purple is nevertheless impossible to misinterpret
however comma given the proximity of said rat at the moment of your the door at the top the stairs opens again
fox and kylie running away from beans farmhouse with two jars of cider
they both look badly shaken
a gunshot rings out taking us to bean is standing darkly in his front doorway
smoke drifts from the end of his luger pointed at the ceiling
a broken light bulb hangs from a wire above his head
boggis and bunce sit together on the porch in rocking chairs startled staring at bean
im going to give a speech and at the end of it im going to throw a twist into this plot
bean lights a cigarette and begins to walk slowly around the porch
first truth this is the most ambitious fox weve ever encountered bar none
bean spins around and shoots out a second light bulb
boggis and bunce look uneasy
second truth the meaning of ambition is defined in the dictionary
bean jumps and rolls and shoots out a third light bulb
third truth the weakness of the ambitious man is his achilles heel bean quickly shoots out three more light bulbs behind his back over his shoulder and between his legs
the porch goes dark
he flicks on a flashlight and points it in his two colleagues faces
they look scared
bean says urgently but ive already figured out where this fox lives and tomorrow night were going to camp in the bushes wait for him to come out of the
hole in his tree and shoot the cuss to smithereens
hows that grab you fellas
boggis and bunce hesitate
they nod and murmur their approval
fox and kylie come quietly into the half lit kitchen dressed in their prowling outfits
they walk to the door
another book party
fox and kylie turn around startled
fox sits on a stool in the darkened pantry
i didnt see you
sitting in the dark over there
actually theres a fire
i just got the call
they said maybe its arson
i got to interview the marshall and see whats kylie is he telling the truth
i dont want to be put in the middle of this
if what i think is happening is it better not be
boggis bunce and bean waiting crouched in the bushes
bean licks his finger and holds it up to test the direction of the wind
he nods points to his nose and gives a thumbs up to boggis and bunce
fox pokes his head up out of his hole
he sniffs once
he moves an inch forward and stops
he sniffs again
he waits a moment and listens
he steps out of the hole and says nice job covering for me
next time a twig snaps
boggis bunce and bean frozen in the bushes
the branches of the trees as the wind suddenly changes its direction
fox on high alert
he rapidly sniffs the air three times in a row
he turns to a confused kylie and says panicking all three
fox and kylie spin around and dart back into the hole as boggis bunce and bean open fire wildly from the bushes
a barrage of bullets and buckshot rips into the tree bark
smoke from the three guns floats upward in the night air
boggis bunce and bean approach the tree
bean shines his flashlight on foxs hole
in the circle of light on the ground lies the tattered blood stained remains of foxs tail
bean picks it up and holds it in the air in front of boggis and bunce
we got the tail but we missed the fox
bean takes out his walkie talkie
you and the boys sober up and get out here on the a
bring eleven shovels three pick axes rounds of ammunition and a bottle of apple cider
fox licks the stump of foxs tail and mends it with gauze and medical tape
she looks furious
kylie and the fox cubs watch concerned
ash says uncertainly itll grow back wont it
shaking his head tails dont grow back except for lizards
tails dont grow back
im going to be tail less for the rest of my life
well anyway its not half as bad as double pneumonia right
pointing to kristofferson his dads got one foot in the grave and one foot on a banana peel
thats a lot worse than kristofferson hurls an acorn violently onto the floor
it ricochets off a wall and into a teacup
everyone falls silent
kristofferson turns away
excuse me everyone
im going to go meditate for half an hour
kristofferson walks out of the room
fox looks at ash and says angrily youve got twenty nine minutes to come up with a proper apology
ash crosses his arms in front of his chest and stares straight ahead into space grimly
fox says suddenly whats with the crazy outfit
why a cape and the pants tucked into your socks
ash does not respond
fox finishes bandaging his tail
fox goes over to the wall and stands with his back to the room
i got fired slash quit the gazette and started stealing chickens on the sly
that tail was the first thing i ever noticed about you
it was easily the most attractive tail for at least miles in every direction
it was probably your single best quality and now its gone forever
fox lying in bed staring at the ceiling in the dark next to mrs
why the cuss didnt i listen my lawyer
at this point well be lucky if we can flip this tree for half of what weve already sunk into it
fox flips over onto his stomach
i wont be able to sleep on my back for six weeks and on my stomach i feel congested
why the cuss didnt i listen to my lawyer
because you dont listen to anybody
sitting up suddenly what was that
i said there is a quiet scraping sound from above
fox jumps out of bed
he hollers wake up
theyre digging us out
there is a scrunch and then a loud thump from above
fox looks at fox intensely theyll kill the children
over my dead body they will
thats what im saying
youd be dead too in that scenario
well im arguing against that
what are you talking about
why are you yelling at me
fox and mrs
fox turn quickly to kylie standing in the doorway with a red blanket wrapped around his shoulders
and kristofferson stand behind him
they look terrified
kylie shouts in a pained voice you say one thing she says another and it all changes back again
the point of a shovel pierces the ceiling
everyone looks up and stares in shock
fox suddenly leaps across the room with a wild energy scrambles halfway up a wall and throws over two chairs
ive got it
theres not a moment to lose
why didnt i think of this before
think of what
think of the one thing a fox does quicker than a man quicker than any other animal in the world
at the top of his lungs everyone digging furiously
dirt flies everywhere
the shot booms down into the ground among the roots of the tree through buried pebbles layers of soil and subterranean mineral deposits
the shot stops at the bottom of a dark hole deep deep underground
fox lies on the floor breathing heavily with a lit lantern at her side
the cubs are sprawled out around her
kylie leans in the corner with his shirt off tied around his waist
fox stands up and clears his throat
everyone looks at him
i think its time for me to give us a pep talk and explain some things
commencing a speech a very long time ago may i have a word with you privately
well were in a hole
where just on the other side of this mineral deposit
fox reluctantly follows mrs
fox through a crack in the bedrock and into a small air pocket with glittering quartz walls
she wheels on fox im going to lose my temper now
well when mrs
fox scratches fox across the face slicing a quick sliver into his fur
fox cringes away with his paws up protectively
he lowers his paws
his eyes fill with tears
note the scar in foxs fur never grows back
fox takes a deep breath
she says twelve fox years ago you made a promise to me while we were caged inside that fox trap that if we survived you would never steal another chicken
goose turkey duck or squab whatever they are
i believed you
why did you lie to me
because im a wild animal
youre also a husband and a father
im trying to tell you the truth about myself
i dont care about the truth about yourself
fox looks down at the ground
he nods and tries to contain his emotions
fox watches him coldly
this story is too predictable
what happens in the end
in the end we all die unless you change
fox walks out of the air pocket
fox stands alone in silence
the next morning
there is a large hole in the side of the hill under foxs tree
the ceiling to the living room has been completely removed
boggis bunce and bean stand half underground with their heads sticking out of the hole breathing hard with dirty shovels over their shoulders
bunce stands on foxs tiny club chair
these foxes dig like a bunch of hyperactive gophers
you got another twist for this plot
say that again
i say you got another bean whips out his walkie talkie and twirls it like a six shooter
he presses a button on it and says
get me the current contact info for earl malloy on the a
whos earl malloy
you mean over at malloy consolidated
oh he does rentals
what does he rent
three yellow and black murderous brutal bulldozer digging tractors with malloy consolidated painted on the sides of them
they make a terrible high pitched growling noise and spit black grease and smoke
boggis bunce and bean stand among the tractors nodding giddily to each other
they scramble into the drivers seats and begin ripping into the hillside
bunce sits on a dictionary to see over the dashboard
fox kylie ash and kristofferson digging frantically
the tractors grabbing huge chunks of earth and tossing them into the meadow
boggis bunce and bean drunk with digging laugh manically as the controls of their tractors
lets kick some fox cuss
im cussing loving this
whos hyper cussing active now
bean throws his tractor into top gear
the teeth of the giant shovels clank against each other ripping through the trees roots
a temperature gauge with its needle pushing the limits of the red
a grizzled white haired man in a greasy yellow and black jumpsuit and coke bottle protective eyeglasses
a patch on his pocket says e
he watches the farmers digging crazily with the tractors
sparks from the mayhem reflect dancing on his lenses
these machines werent made to be handled like this
the hill with half its earth dug out from under the tree
the tree still stands precariously above the wild tractors
the hill now razed with the fallen old beech tree laying on its side as the tractors dig deeper
the tractors almost completely below ground in a deep crater
a crowd of neighbors and local press from the town has gathered and watches as the tractors stop digging and rumble up out of the crater
the motors go quiet
boggis bunce and bean climb down from their tractors
they look angry and tired
they stand among the workers and onlookers
a television reporter with an action camera crew confronts farmer correct me if im misreading the data youve successfully destroyed the scenery but the alleged fox remains at large
what will you three prominent farmers do now
well dan i can tell you what were not going to do
were not going to let him go
are you concerned about the possibility i have no further dialogue in this scene
bean turns away from the reporter and pulls boggis and bunce aside
he addresses them with calm intensity im not going home until we smoke this son of a cuss out his hole string him up on a clothesline and fly him
like a kite
boggis how many men have you got working on your farm
and ive got thirty seven
thats men altogether
now what do i got here

a helicopter with a bean inc
decal on the side of it circles the crater scanning the dark terrain with a searchlight
there are tents trucks and men gathered around the perimeter
they sit on bricks and logs and are armed with bats pistols rifles shotguns bows and arrows and hatchets
fox his family and kylie lie exhausted on the floor of their deep hole
the walls are covered with knotted roots and vines
fox says to kylie one of those slovenly farmers is probably wearing my tail as a necktie by now
youre paranoid foxy
bean sitting in her kitchen watching television next to an extremely skinny freckled twelve year old boy
the boy points at the screen and laughs to himself look at dads tie
the television set
bean is on screen with the action reporter
he wears a fox fur necktie
there is a full moon
lanterns glow in the farmers tents
a group of farmhands sit around a campfire next to the crater
one of them cooks a chicken on a spit
another sits on a log playing a banjo
he is petey
he sings bout a handsome little fox let me sing you folks a yarn
hey diddle dee doddle do doodle dum

the shot moves past the leathery faces of the other farmhands as they listen amused moved hungry tired charmed annoyed whistling playing a jews harp trying to sing along but
not really knowing the words etc
like any little critter needin vittels for his littluns well he stole and he cheated and he lied to survive

petey stops short
everyone turns quickly and sees bean standing over them in the darkness with his luger in one hand and a cigarette in the other
petey looks nervous
i dont know
i was just kind of making it up as i was going along
petey trails off
bean shakes his head
he looks highly irritated
thats just weak song writing
you wrote a bad song petey
bean throws his cigarette into the campfire
he storms away
petey turns to the other farmhands
everyone looks uncomfortable
days later fox days morning in the farmers camp
the cook flips an egg on a skillet
he puts it on a plate with bacon and hands it to petey
petey asks him
how long can a fox go without food or water
the exhausted foxes and kylie underground
kylie says well i can only answer as an opossum but i dont think i can last more than another couple of hours before i get completely dehydrated and starve
a tiny hole appears in the wall at the end of the tunnel
dirt crumbles out of it and a bit of metal catches a glint
fox and his family watch frozen
a breath of air blows into the tunnel
the flame on mrs
foxs lantern flickers once and goes out
not a sound
there is a sudden loud scrabbling noise
a match strikes
fox touches it to mrs
foxs lantern wick
the tiny hole in the wall has become a large one
badger stands in front of fox with his law partner beaver beavers overgrown hulking son a medium sized mole and a grey field mouse with a bandana tied in a
do rag style around his head
badger has a spoon in his hand
fox and badger erupt at each other screaming simultaneously you scared the cuss out of us
i told you not to buy at nine and a cussing half
you dont just bang into somebodys cussing tunnel
are you cussing yelling at me
youre cussing right im cussing yelling
were all cussing starving to death because of you you mangy cussing little cuss
fox and badger snarl and scratch at each other circling around the hole
they calm down slightly
badger continues weve been digging in circles for three days
half the woodsve been obliterated
nobody can get out
right now my wifes huddled at the bottom of the flint mine with mrs
beaver rabbits ex girlfriend no food no water and twenty seven hungry whining starving little animal brats
this is a total cluster cuss for everybody
fox looks around the room at the entire gaunt dirty emaciated assembly
everyone stares at him angrily
the mole says softly
i just want to see a little sunshine
but youre nocturnal phil
your eyes barely even open on a good day
im sick of your double talk
we have rights
beavers son looms over ash and kristofferson in a muddy alcove on the side of the tunnel
he pokes ash in the chest with the finger of his paw
we dont like you and we hate your dad
youre too snazzy
you dress like a girl
now grab some of that mud chew it in your mouth and swallow it
scared and disgusted im not going to eat mud
cuss yeah you are
beavers son grabs a handful of mud smashes it into ashs mouth and forces his jaws up and down in a chewing motion
ash coughs and splutters
he takes off his shoes with his feet
he says with a quiet ferocity dont do that
beavers son looks to kristofferson
he looks down at kristoffersons feet
whyd you take your shoes off
so i dont break your nose when i kick it
kristofferson kicks beavers son in the face karate chops his neck elbow jabs him twice in the gut and flips the enormous youth over his shoulder and into the mud
beavers son gets up crying and walks out of the alcove
ash watches blankly with mud all over his mouth as kristofferson puts his shoes back on
i can fight my own fights
badger and fox stand facing each other at the end of the tunnel
badger says aggressively those farmers arent going to quit until theyve got you and every member of your family nailed upside down to a bloody stick with your eyes gorged
this is getting a little too personal
badger waits for fox to continue
fox stares into space
give me a minute
fox turns and walks away
he faces the wall of the tunnel
he sits down on a rock
everyone watches him uncertainly
they look at each other
badger starts to say something but kylie cuts him off sharply shh
badger falls silent
fox sits with his chin on his paw lost in concentrated thought
he stands up
he nods repeatedly and begins to pace
his eyes dart from one spot to another
his paws move abruptly around in the air drawing lines and shapes
he freezes and looks straight up at the ceiling of the tunnel
he snaps the fingers of his paw and looks to the others
he says with a cautious excitement ive got an idea
what is it
it could be a good one
lay it on us
it might save our lives
say the idea
fox looks down at ash who stands beside him with mud still on his mouth
he says suddenly all right
lets try it
fox runs over to mrs
fox go to the flint mine
badger rabbits ex girlfriend et al
that help is on the way
is help on the way
fox grips mrs
he looks into her eyes and says i sure as cuss hope so
fox detects a special familiar inspired light in her husbands eyes at this moment
she hands ash the lantern
she straightens the neck line of his cape licks the mud off ashs snout and scrambles away down badgers tunnel
ash wants to cry but does not
fox turns to the others
gentlemen this time we must dig in a very special direction
fox feels the walls with his paws
everyone watches attentively
i got to kind of feel out the vibe
he points slightly downwards and due south
he says with quiet anticipation begin
everyone starts digging slowly but intently
the diggers one hundred yards later
fox suddenly whistles and raises his fist
the diggers stop digging
fox feels the ceiling with his paws
he knocks something hard
it sounds hollow
he looks at the others with a funny expression and raises an eyebrow
fox carefully pushes up a floorboard
it creaks loudly
they all duck down and wait
fox pushes up a second floorboard
he cautiously pokes his head up through
he lets out a shriek of excitement and whispers excitedly down to the others ive done it
ive done it first time
come up and see where you are my darlings
everyone scrambles up out of the tunnel
everyone stands in the middle of boggis chicken house
the room is teeming with chickens which stare at them nervously
there are black chickens white chickens brown chickens and one that combines all three colors
fox i hit it slap in the middle
do you get how incredible this is
the others nod
they look dazed and wild
fox holds up his hands and whispers dont lose your heads now
lets do this properly
first everyone have a drink of water
fox leads the others over to the chickens drinking trough
they all lap up the cool water
fox dries his mouth
fox seizes a black chicken violently
ash and kristofferson running down the tunnel carrying two dead black chickens
they turn three corners and arrive at the mossy hollow
they look inside
fox and the other diggers tunnel under the silo in front of bunce industries
cows eat grass in the pasture above
fox and the other diggers comes out of a hole in the floor and dance an ecstatic jig in a great storeroom lined to the ceiling with plucked ducks and
smoked hams and sides of bacon dangle from the rafters
fox and the other diggers tunnel under the windmill in front of bean inc
sheep eat clover in the field above
fox and the other diggers comes out of a hole in the floor and dance an ecstatic jig in a corrugated plastic and metal pen among dozens of gobbling turkeys
fox and the other diggers race dancing ecstatically back through the complex network of tunnels carrying dead turkeys geese bacon flour salt sugar jars of cider and a portable television
the flint mine is a large but cozy space with stone walls a dirt floor a small kitchen and a fireplace
there are rows of cots sleeping bags boxes blankets and suitcases for all the refugee animals
all the animals have gathered together and drink cider cocktails while small rabbits skunks and field mice set the table
the room is festooned with garlands
a well dressed mole smoking a pipe plays the piano
a bespectacled rabbit leans against it humming a tune
weasel stands in the corner talking with beaver
what am i going to do
im going to hold him to the terms of the contract
its not my fault they uprooted it
kristofferson serves cranberry punch from a tureen in the corner
ash goes over to him and holds out a mug
they say i owe you an apology for some of the mean things i said about your fathers illness
his double pneumonia or whatever theyre calling it now
kristofferson ladles ash a cupful
so there it is
i hope we can continue our relationship as cousins or family members or however you want to define suddenly more intense but do me a favor for yourself
the next time you have a problem with something ive said come to me as a fox
and lets deal with it right then and not let it blow up into a whole huge thing involving parents and so on
ash drinks his punch in one long sip and holds out the empty mug for a refill
kristofferson nods slowly
he points at ash with his ladle
im going to teach you karate
badger sits next to the fireplace with fox and kylie
i can imagine how painful even just emotionally that must be for you
well you know its not the end of the world
oh but foxy how humiliating
having your whole tail blown clean off by a can we drop it
kristofferson starts to refill ashs mug again
ash suddenly puts his paw over the brim
ash raises an eyebrow and says mysterriously ever tasted one of mrs
beans famous nutmeg ginger apple snaps
a large fire truck drives up to the destroyed hill with firemen hanging off the back and sides
it parks among the tractors and tents
the chief in a white helmet goes over to boggis bunce and bean waiting at the mouth of the pit
a patch on his sleeve says o
farmhands and firemen circle around
whos got me a donation for the old wounded firemans retirement pension fund
bean pulls a yellow check out of his inside pocket
pointing behind him let me show you this hole
candles glow all around
everyone is seated at the long dining room table and a magnificent feast with every variety of fruit meat vegetable and roasted bird has been laid out in front of
they tear into their meals eating and drinking ferociously
crumbs juices blood and bones fly into the air
jaws snap and chew
there is no conversation
badger suddenly stands and rings a knife against his cider glass
everyone looks up taking a breather from the frenzy of eating
badger clears his throat
well it took a near catastrophe for all of you to finally take me up on my offer to have you over to the flint mine for dinner but i
guess we have im sorry
maybe my invitation got lost in the mail
does anybody know what this badgers talking about
fox sits at the opposite end of the table with a crooked smile on his face
but clives right in all seriousness aside to badger excuse me b
fox raises his cider glass
badger reluctantly sits back down
i guess we do have those three ugly cusshole farmers to thank for one thing reminding us to be thankful and aware of each other
im going to say it again
badger whispers to his wife
foxy cuss blocked my toast man
the hole where foxs tree once stood
the dead tree lies on its side
a fireman slides a thick hose deep into the tunnel
he looks behind him and nods
the shot moves backwards along the hose past seven more firemen signalling to each other with a thumbs up a snap a fist in the air a swirl of the
fingers a peace symbol an a ok and a hook em horns
the shot continues past boggis bunce and bean helping to hold the hose in position
the shot arrives at a pump on the side of the fire truck
the chief points let her rip
a fireman cranks a huge wrench on a steel nut
a pressure gauge shoots to maximum
the fire truck and hose begin to vibrate loudly
ash and kristofferson crouched under a drain cover pushed just open next to a refrigerator
they peer out across a bright clean white kitchen at a plate of perfect golden cookies on a counter top next to an open window with a step ladder directly
in front of it
they look at each other
they look around the quiet empty room
ash and kristofferson dart out leaving the drain cover propped up
they race over the linoleum
they climb the step ladder and stop at the plate
ash swoons and says theyre still warm
ash and kristofferson gather more cookies than they can possibly carry eating as they collect them
crumbs go everywhere
on the other side of the room the drain cover falls shut with a loud clank
ash and kristofferson look up wildly startled
all at once they hear in a simultaneous cacophony the back door bursting open a boy and two beagles shouting and barking the pantry door slamming mrs
bean and her
middle aged housekeeper clanging pots and pans and arguing a timer on the counter top ringing and a raven fluttering to the windowsill and cawing
ash and kristofferson panic silently
they drop the cookies and fly down the step ladder
fox in mid toast ive stepped on some toes and alienated a few of you over the past few days but is it wrong for me to suggest we mightve
done worse than having an incredible banquet in a beautiful flint mine surrounded by our favorite animals
look at each other
here we are
now ive already had too much to drink and im feeling sentimental but im going to say something anyway which nobody wants to admit but i think is probably true
we beat em
we beat those farmers and now were triumphantly eating their roasted chicken their sizzling duck their succulent turkey their foie gras de whered the boys go
fox what am i hearing again baby
am i still paranoid
there is a low distant rumbling which rapidly builds to a deafening roar
everyone waits frozen
a single drop of water drips from the ceiling into badgers water glass
fox turns to badger and says lets pause again
a wild deluge smashes into the room flooding the flint mine and tunnels with a blasting current that sweeps everyone and everything away chaotically
the entire party of well dressed animals and their plates furniture chickens etc
shooting down the tunnel with the rushing waters
fox helpless holding his breath looks to the others underwater badger shakes his head in disgust rabbit makes a fierce grimace mole bares his teeth ferociously beaver rants angrily with
bubbles coming out off his mouth and kylie stares ahead vacantly holding his nose
fox turns sadly to mrs
she looks terrified
the flood blasts out of a wide pipe rocketing the animals into a murky brick cavern with drainpipes on all sides and three inches of black water on its floor
fox picks himself up dazed and scared and looks around at his soaked friends and their families
what the cuss just happened
something with water
that was dangerous
is anyone hurt
were all hurt
my entire flint mine just got demolished
lets do a head count
everybody pick a buddy
each animal turns to his neighbor and establishes their buddy relationship
fox looks wildly agitated as his eyes dart about searching
he shouts whered the boys go
ashs voice cracks on the other side of the cavern im here
everyone turns to see ash standing at the mouth of a smaller pipe
he looks devastated and terrified
fox points to him
whos your buddy
kristofferson but i lost him
you lost him
where were you
we went for cookies
everyone turns to fox
fox yells desperately
fox sprints around the cavern splashing digging and ducking in and out of tunnels as the others join his frantic search
his voice sounds pained as he shouts kristofferson
the three farmers standing next to the fire truck
bean holds a soaked half conscious kristofferson up in the air by the tail
kristofferson is quietly crying
wrap this wet little mutt in a newspaper and put him in a box with some holes punched in the top
everyone has gathered together
they are all in a state of shock
fox turns to mrs
fox beside him
your brothers going to kill me if he survives his double pneumonia
beaver runs into the brick cavern out of a drainpipe theres only one way out of this sewer but the manhole covers closed and theres a station wagon parked on
it which means were permanently stuck down here
you still think we beat em foxy
everyone turns to fox and stares at him coldly
fox sits down on the floor in the water
he says quietly somebody take over
im not in charge anymore
everyone looks around at each other
they dont know what to do
fox sits down in the water next to fox
you told me to change but i cant except possibly on some level i think i just did
well then maybe were not all going to die
fox looks to mrs
he stands up suddenly
he takes mrs
excuse us everyone
fox leads mrs
fox over to a ledge near a cement waterfall on the far side of the brick cavern
he puts his arm around her waist
these farmers arent going to quit until they catch me
i shouldnt have lied to your face
i shouldnt have resigned slash gotten fired from the gazette
i shouldnt have pushed these farmers so far and tried to embarrass them and cuss with their heads
i enjoyed it but i shouldnt have done it and now theres only one way out
maybe if i hand myself over and let them kill me stuff me and hang me over their youll do no such thing
darling maybe theyll let everyone else live
fox stares at fox
she says desolately whyd you have to get us into this foxy
i dont know but i have a possible theory
i think i have this thing where i need everybody to think im the greatest the quote unquote fantastic mr
fox and if they arent completely knocked out dazzled and kind of intimidated by me then i dont feel good about myself
fox shakes her head and turns away
fox continues foxes traditionally like to court danger hunt prey and outsmart predators and thats what im actually good at
i think at the end of the day im just were wild animals
fox smiles sadly and nods
i guess we always were
i promise you if i had all this to do over again id have never let you down
it was always more fun when we did it together anyway
fox has tears all over her face
fox kisses her
he whispers in her ear i love you felicity
i love you too but i shouldnt have married you
fox turns and walks away
fox stares after her
he goes over to ash
did i ever tell you about the time i learned we were going to have a cub
in the fox trap
we were at gun point and your
says shes pregnant
let me tell it ok
i had no idea how we were going to get out of this jam and then it hit me what do foxes do better than any other animal
youre stepping on my lines
keep telling it
so we dug
and the whole time i put paw over paw scooping dirt and pebbles with your mother digging like crazy beside me i kept wondering who is this little boy going
or girl right because at that point we didnt know
fox grabs ash by his shoulders and looks him in the eye
ash im so glad he was you
fox hugs ash tightly holds him for an instant then lets go
he turns to the group
badger organize a search party and try to find kristofferson
maybe hes alive
im sorry everyone
i wish well good bye
fox looks across the cavern to mrs
fox standing with her back to him
she turns to face him
her eyes are burning
fox smiles sadly
he races away down the drain pipe
everyone watches him disappear
he addresses the
i guess we should probably split into a certain number of groups and start doing something right
fox sprints full speed in the darkness
his claws scratch rattling along the iron floor and splash through puddles of shallow water
fox stops suddenly
he stands up tall on his hind legs
his ears perk up
one pins back
badger carrying a lantern leading ash mole and two small rabbits down a drainpipe
badger calls out kristofferson
can you hear us
rats voice echoes in the darkness yall lookin for somethin
nothin down here but rusty bottle caps and drainin water
everyone stops short
rat drops into the pipe from an overhead drain ahead of them
he says ominously they got the boy
whos got him
the farmers three
you know who im talkin about
theyve kidnapped him
well done mr
youre a smart man
they want to trade the son for his poppa
rat flicks a folded letter through the air
badger catches it
he opens it
kylie looks over his shoulder
whyd they write this in letters cut out of magazines
to protect their identities
on second thought oh right but then whyd they sign their names
plus we already knew who they were because theyre trying to kill us
a ransom note written in letters cut out of magazines and pasted onto a piece of paper
badger reads out loud mr
fox we have your son
if you ever want to see him alive again ash calls out im his son
everyone looks at ash
he stands behind them in silhouette
rat says darkly i can see the resemblance
in an instant rat grabs ash by the tail picks him up off the ground swings him in the air and flings him away twenty feet down the drainpipe
badger looks stunned
ash sits in a puddle in a stupor
rat races toward him down the tunnel
he leaps into the air with his claws out and his teeth bared
as he is about to seize upon ash he is suddenly jerked backwards and spun around
rat is face to face with fox
fox strikes his old fashioned boxing stance
he draws back and throws a hard punch nailing rat square in the jaw
rat staggers stunned
he swings his switchblade cutting fox across the chest
fox touches the wound and looks at the blood on the fingers of his paw
he looks to rat
rat holds up his wrist and shows fox a childs plastic digital watch with miniature footballs baseballs and soccer balls on it
he says strangely
ive still got it
whatd you just say
i said ive still got the watch mr
she never asked for it back
a frozen moment
fox springs forward and clamps his jaws onto rats throat
rat tumbles over backwards
fox pins him to the ground with his teeth in rats neck
rat kicks and bucks and struggles but fox holds him fast
rat goes limp
fox releases him
everyone slowly gathers around fox and rat
ash kneels next to his father
fox cradles rat in his arms
rat whispers the boys locked in an apple crate on top of a gun locker in the attic of bean annex
its a set up
would you have told me if i didnt kill you first
rat smiles sickly
blood drips from his mouth
his voice never
shaking his head all these wasted years
what were you looking for rat
fox wipes the blood from rats chin
hes trying to say something dad
fox leans his ear close to rats mouth
as quiet as a mouse cider
he looks around the drainpipe
he cups his paw into the pool of murky water and holds it to rats lips
here you are rat
a beaker of beans finest secret cider
rats slivery scratchity long pink tongue laps up a taste of the black liquid
he licks his lips and says faintly like melted gold
rats eyes turn into xs
he is dead
ash stands up
he redeemed himself
fox swallows and says hopelessly with tears in his eyes but in the end hes just another dead rat in a garbage pail behind a chinese restaurant
ash puts his hand on foxs shoulder
fox lays rat gently onto the sewer floor
he stands up and turns to the rest of the group
badger claps his paws together
well i suppose we should excuse me again b
the search partys been cancelled
were replacing it with a go for broke rescue mission
its a set up but maybe we can make it work
you two little rabbits run tell the others
the two little rabbits scurry away down the drainpipe
badger walks with fox and ash
what was he saying about that wristwatch
i didnt get what he was talking about
he shrugs and says with a sad nostalgia just some old back story
the entire community of animals has reconnoitered in the brick cavern
fox stands on a large spigot and addresses the group
he has a bandage on his chest
in a way im almost glad that flood interrupted us because i dont like the toast i was giving
im going to start over
fox pantomimes raising a long stemmed glass
when i look down this table with the exquisite feast set before us i see two terrific lawyers a skilled pediatrician a wonderful chef a savvy real estate agent an
excellent tailor a crack accountant a gifted musician a pretty good minnow fisherman and possibly the best landscape painter working on the scene today
as fox describes them the shot cuts to badger and beaver mrs
badger rabbit weasel an especially small waifish field mouse mole kylie who looks slightly offended and mrs
maybe a few of you might even read my column from time to time
i tend to doubt it
i also see a room full of wild animals
everyone stares at fox curiously skeptical but intrigued
fox points at them wild animals with true natures and pure talents
wild animals with scientific sounding latin names that mean something about our d
wild animals each with his own strengths and weaknesses due to his or her species and also well i guess these things usually have a lot to
do with the parents as we all know
anyway i think it may very well be all the beautiful differences among us that just might give us the tiniest glimmer of a chance of saving my nephew and
letting me make it up to you for getting us into this crazy whatever it is
i dont know
its just a thought
thank you for listening
fox motions with his imaginary glass and pantomimes drinking it
a few of the others reluctantly pantomime drinking
fox finishes his glass and pantomimes throwing it on the floor
he makes a smashing glass sound
kylie shouts lets eat
everyone turns to kylie uncertainly
im just playing along with the all right
lets start planning
who knows shorthand
badger points to his otter secretary
she is linda
fox darts over to her and grips her by the arm
you got some dry paper
here we go
fox highly energized moves among the group touching their shoulders and patting their backs
what do you got
i can see in the dark
we can use that
you bet your cuss you are
i can chew through wood
explosions flames things that burn
foxs cheeks and forehead are beaded with perspiration
fox snaps his fingers kicks a rock and throws his arm into the air
fox points to the various cubs and pups
all you little kids get organized and put together some kind of a k
unit or something to keep this sewer clean
its good for morale
the field mouse shoves his way to the front of the crowd
he makes a fist with his paw
i want to go with you too
i want to fight
do you do that in fact
are field mice violent
not particularly except maybe domestic kitchen sink type stuff but i have a hunch i might just land a few good punches before i get stepped on poisoned or lured
to my death by a little piece of cheese
whos to say
smiling with admiration youre a cuss of a lot bigger than you look rickity
kylie tugs at foxs sleeve
fox turns to look at him
kylie i didnt get a job yet or a latin name
whats my strength
fox raises an eyebrow
he thinks of something
listen youre kylie
youre an unbelievably nice guy
your job is really just to
be available i think
i dont know your latin name
i doubt they even had opossums in ancient rome
kylie puts his hands in his pockets and scowls
fox puts the finishing touches on a vast mural painted on the longest tallest wall of the brick cavern
she stands on a ladder
her sleeves are rolled up and she is splattered with twelve different colors of paint
she looks down to fox standing below with an entourage of kylie badger linda and rickity
the animal children mop and scrub in the background
ash stands leaning against a push broom watching his parents
fox surveys the mural
it is highly detailed filled with the textures of the landscape and decorated with images of flowers leaves acorns etc
it is signed felicity fox
fox opens his arms wide and shouts its stupendous
pointing to a spot right here
paint an x
the bottom of the map
foxs paw paints a red x and puts a circle around it
the shot zooms out to reveal the entire valley no longer a painting on the brick wall
lighting strikes at the horizon
dark clouds loom over the three farmers compounds
it looks exactly like one of mrs
foxs paintings of a landscape in a rainstorm
beans helicopter circles the area
a bicycle messenger with a head lamp rings his bell as he approaches the farmers camp
he stops in front of bean and hands him an envelope
bean tears it open and unfolds the letter inside
a note written in letters cut out of magazines and pasted onto a piece of paper
it reads dear farmers boggis bunce and bean i have no alternative but to agree to your terms
move the station wagon and open the manhole cover below the foot of the drainpipe next to the cobblers shop and meet me there today at a
i will hand myself over to you in exchange for the boys safe return
fox bean frowns
he studies the letter
he shows it to boggis and bunce
whyd he write this in letters cut out of magazines
i dont know but you did the same thing
i dont trust this guy
anyway set up the ambush
the top floor of bean annex
the room is filled with boxes of christmas ornaments old sports equipment two stained mattresses and a broken birdcage
cobwebs hang from the rafters below the sloped roof
kristofferson stands with his hands in his pockets looking out between the slats from inside a padlocked apple crate on top of a gun locker in the corner
he clears his throat
he calls out politely could i have a cup of water please
kristofferson waits for a reply but no one answers
he whistles to himself for a minute
he clears his throat again
he calls out excuse me
a cement conduit with an iron grating above it
a fast stream of sewer water runs along its side
fox walks briskly down the pipe followed by his entourage and ash
their steps echo loudly
synchronize your clocks
the time is fox looks at his wrist
he is wearing rats plastic digital sports themed wristwatch
nine forty five a
everyone checks their watches
badger points at foxs wrist
is that rats watch
well ok heres the back story when i was a teenager i spent a summer working as a bar back at a jazz pub called djangos where rat played horn
down near can i tell this another time
we should stay focused on whats happening right now
ash comes up to foxs side and says discreetly i should probably ride with you and kylie since its my fault kristofferson got captured stealing those nutmeg ginger apple snaps
i didnt understand a word of that sentence but none of it matters anyway because its too dangerous for you to come with us
an old craftsman looks out from the window of ferguson cobblers as he taps little nails into the heel of a loafer
a station wagon with wood grain side panels and a flat tire sits parked on a manhole cover in front of the shop
boggis bunce and five armed farmhands watch as bean monkeys with a slim jim until he gets the car door jimmied
bean hops inside
he starts the engine puts his arm over the top of the seat as he looks back out the rear window and throws the station wagon into reverse
the farmers clear out of the way as bean backs up off the manhole cover
boggis and bunce stick tools into the manhole cover and lift it open
it is now a

bunce presses play on a tape recorder
kristoffersons voice comes over a loudspeaker
bunce presses stop
fox and his entourage at the bottom off the manhole
he smiles and shakes his head
that doesnt sound anything like him
its amateur night in dixie
badger rapidly slaps two pieces of flint together
a bit chips off and sparks fly from the break
he blows on some kindling
he takes a pinecone out of a basket
a ribbon of white smoke rises out of the manhole
the three farmers watch curiously as it thickens and turns black
what the cuss is he burning
a blazing pinecone shoots out of the manhole and flies through the air over the farmers heads
it lands in a trash can and lights some rubbish on fire
a man with a dart in one hand and a mug of ale in the other comes out of the nags head and pours his beer into the trash can
the fire goes out
the three farmers laugh smugly
bean shouts is that all youve got mr

the beagles eat blueberries
they fall over
eight farmhands chase weasel and beaver up a wooded path
rickity the field mouse bounds out of the hole and leaps into the fracas
he fires a rubber band at bunce off a paperclip
it snaps bunce in the corner of his eye
rickity lets out a little whoop
there is a small explosion and a burst of flames blasts from the manhole
fox and kylie jump out and run over to a vehicle with a tarp over it parked in front of paddington automotive
fox whips off the tarp revealing a miniature motorcycle with a sidecar
fox driving the motorcycle with kylie in the sidecar
they both wear helmets and goggles
thunder rumbles in the distance
kylie sinks lower in the sidecar
he shouts to fox over the sound of the motor are you scared of wolves
i have a phobia of them
well i have a thing about thunder
ash pokes his head up from the rear compartment of the sidecar
he also wears a helmet and goggles
his white cape flutters behind him
he shouts i dont like needles
fox and kylie look to ash in disbelief
fox says furiously whered you come from again
howd you get in the sidecar
i feel like im losing my mind
fox angrily steers toward a small mound of dirt
they jump it slightly and fly over a little ditch
ash yelps enthusiastically as fox drives them back onto the road
a pilot with a red moustache and a south african accent flies beans chopper
he wears a bean inc
patch on his shoulder
he shouts into the microphone connected to his helmet ive got a fox on a motorcycle with a littler fox and what looks to be an opossum in the sidecar
riding north on farm lane seven
does that sound like anything to anybody
a military type voice responds over the radio roger that red
let me just uh oh i think the boss wants to red its franklin bean
turn around get the cuss back here and pick us up on the
the bean inc
windmill spins briskly in the dusty winds
shutters on the farmhouse bang open and shut
leaves rustle on the branches of the apple trees
a few stray turkeys wander in the yard
a white washed brick pile six stories tall sits apart from the other structures
the doors to its courtyard are made of iron and painted yellow
this is bean annex
the front gates of the farm are open and a gardener waters vegetables next to the driveway
fox kylie and ash look out from a high branch over a reinforced concrete and barbed wire security barricade
thats the annex over there on the right
kylie does not respond
the white building over there on the right
fox looks to kylie
kylie turns to fox and stares at him vacantly
fox says kylie
i did it
i didnt see it
kylie makes his slight gesture with his paw
the gardener puts three turnips into a basket and rides away on his bicycle
fox kylie and ash scramble down the tree trunk
they come out of the bushes on their motorcycle and ride through the gates across the yard past the wandering turkeys
they park outside the courtyard doors to bean annex and jump off the motorcycle
fox climbs onto kylies shoulders and tries the knobs
they are locked
kylie you got a credit card
digging in his pockets sure
see this is what i was saying about how good you are at just being available for kylie hands fox a world traveler titanium card
a titanium card
how the cuss did you qualify for this
i pay my bills on time
ive always had good credit
fox examines the card with mild resentment
he picks the lock and opens the doors
the courtyard has high walls and a gravel floor
on one side there are ten trash cans a stack of newspapers and a compost heap
on the other side there is an old rusted broken down tractor and a new one
by far the largest fattest toughest beagle yet lies sleeping in the middle
white foam froths around its mouth as it breathes heavily
its collar is hooked to a thick chain
a tag around its neck reads spitz
fox kylie and ash stop in their tracks
the beagle opens his eyes
fox turns to kylie
give me a blueberry
kylie looks surprised
he shakes his head and gestures i dont have any
he throws up his hands in the air
kylie makes a frustrated face
fox points at him
kylie looks away and snorts angrily
fox looks away and spits at the ground
ash says quietly whats that white stuff around his mouth
i think he eats soap
fox sees an amber plastic pharmacy bottle on a shelf above some bags of fertilizer
its reads drug phenomoxylcarbobubytol mg for rabies chronic other take with meat do not operate heavy machinery fox frowns
he says grimly thats not soap
well then why does he have that bubbly hes rabid
ive heard about this beagle
the beagle stands up
fox says carefully easy boy
fox takes a cautious step toward the beagle
he holds out the back of his paw for the beagle to sniff
he says back over his shoulder to kylie and ash im going to try to befriend him
i feel like theres a tenderness in his eyes
fox takes another step
he makes a soft kissing noise
the beagle watches him calmly
yes im right
hes a good boy
a little lonely maybe but fox takes another cautious step
but terribly sweet
hello there boy
is your name spitz
thats german isnt it
aside to ash i thought he said you never look a beagle in the eye
why youre just as sweet as a fox and the beagle lock eyes
the pupils of the beagles eyes contract then completely disappear and the whites turn bright red
foxs eyes open wider than their sockets
the rabid beagle erupts ballistically attacking like an enraged maniac
his chain rips out of the cement
fox kylie and ash shriek and scream sprinting frantically around the courtyard as the rabid beagle frothing roaring and snapping tries desperately to kill them
fox shouts his voice cracking like a grandmothers climb the trellis
in well under a second fox kylie and ash scale the trellis six stories kylies pants catching on a nail and ripping off on the way up and find themselves
standing on the roof of bean annex
kylie wears blue fruit of the looms with a pattern of stars moons and planets on them
they all look down at the rabid beagle which continues to pitch an insane fit running in circles after its tail at the bottom of the courtyard
fox takes in their new surroundings
he says pleased so the attic is probably in the area right up around here somewhere i figure huh
kylie and ash panting and dripping with sweat both stare at fox vacantly
note a second set of alternate eyeballs indicating kylies vacant look will be used for ash in this shot
come on guys
stay with me
we did good
thats just some dog
lets not get traumatized
beans helicopter lands on top of the nags head
fires smolder and farmers continue to chase around after animals in the village streets below
boggis bunce and bean leaning over and holding onto their hats run to the chopper and climb inside
they take off
the street below
an orange and yellow citroen van screeches into the melee
painted yellow letters spell badoit et fils destruction des animaux nuisibles on the side of it with an image of a trapped fox
an old man with a grey moustache and a young man with a black moustache both dressed in orange and yellow striped uniforms jump out of the van
they open the side door and start unloading stacks of metal cages
rabbit still running full steam down a country lane being pursued by the six farmhands
kristofferson stands inside the apple crate leaning against the wall with his legs crossed and one arm akimbo with his hand on his hip
there is a clanking sound from above
kristofferson looks up
a trap door in the ceiling creaks open
fox kylie and ash look inside down at kristofferson
kristofferson smiles oddly and says in a surprised fancy meeting you here voice hi
fox and kylie lowering ash into the room with three different colored shoelaces tied together and belted around his waist
ash holds the shoelace and keeps a paw behind his back like a mountaineer
his feet touch down on the shelf
he runs to the apple crate and jiggles the padlock
he says can i get one of those karate lessons real quick
normally we start with some breathing exercises and such
stand like this
kristofferson stands with his paws clasped in front of him
ash mimics this
a fox trap hanging from a chain suspended above the alley behind the nags head tavern
a second one hangs behind sweetings bakery
a third one hangs behind harrison travel
a fourth one hangs behind st
johns coin op laundry
a fifth one hangs behind ferguson cobblers
rickity curiously examines a little hanging wire
he mutters is this spring loaded
kristofferson continuing ashs karate lesson this next part is mental
position yourself on the balls of your feet
kristofferson stands lightly poised with his arms out
ash mimics this
close your eyes
kristofferson closes his eyes
so does ash
so do fox and kylie
kristofferson says mystically you weigh less than a slice of bread
each fox trap in rapid succession as it falls on rickity badger weasel and beaver
the two small rabbits watch from a sewer gutter drain under the street curb
they race down a pipe into a tunnel and through a conduit
kristofferson continuing ashs karate lesson
lets review the principle agility techniques jumping flipping landing
fox looking down from her ladder at the three panting rabbits
she looks stunned
she motions to her mural map and show me where they are
the two small rabbits mrs
badger mole and mrs
fox each furiously digging a new tunnel
now for a rudimentary version of the cyclone chop
kristofferson continuing ashs karate lesson first you need to get a running start which obviously i cant do in here then as you arrive at the destination of the chop
lean and thrust into the point of contact paw remains open and straight then withdraw instantaneously
remember its the pull back that matters
the pull generates the force of the impact
ash walks ten paces away to the far end of the shelf
fox and kylie watch from above
kylie says excitedly hes going to do it
fox makes a face that says im not so sure
ash takes a deep breath
he screams at the top of his lungs as he sprints toward the apple crate
ashs toe catches on a loose nail
he somersaults twice through the air and bounces off the side of the apple crate which falls off the shelf
kristofferson braces himself
the apple crate hits the floor and shatters into pieces
kristofferson lies among the wreckage
ash looks over the side of the shelf
fox and kylie watch from above grimacing
thats all right
you were just trying to unlock the apple crate
no i mean im sorry about picking himself up oh you mean from before
the apology you owed me which you never actually said
kristofferson nods sadly
he takes a deep breath
he nods again
thats all right too
throw me the shoelace please
badger trapped in his cage
he hears something
he looks quickly down the alley
the old orange van turns the corner and approaches bumping over potholes
badger shrinks into the corner of the cage and mutters grimly to himself badoit et fils
a cobblestone beside badger suddenly drops straight down and disappears into the ground
badger recoils scared and confused
fox pokes her head up through the hole
she is beaded with perspiration and breathes heavily
her fur is wildly dishevelled
she looks to the van driving up the alley
she looks to badger
she extends her paw to him and says lets go
fox kylie ash and kristofferson come around the side of the building
they run to their motorcycle outside the courtyard doors
the front gates to the compound are closed and bolted
beans helicopter waits on top of the vegetable garden with its rotar blades whirling
boggis bunce and bean stand in front of bean annex with their weapons drawn
fox sees his tail around beans collar
his eyes narrow
his jaw sets
he says to himself with growing emotion your tractors uprooted my tree
your posse hunted my family
your gunmen kidnapped my nephew
your rat insulted my wife and you shot off my tail
im not leaving here without that neck tie
bean smiles his sickly smile
fox smiles back defiantly
kylie looks utterly baffled
ash says mystically i weigh less than a slice of bread
ill be right back
fox kylie and kristofferson watch shocked as ash sprints back to the courtyard doors
the three farmers open fire at him
fox kylie and kristofferson duck and take cover behind a hay bale
ash dodges bullets
he jumps off the balls of his feet with his arms out over a sprinkler pipe and swings like a gymnast onto a clothesline then flies through the air doing
another of his spectacularly awkward four armed and three legged back flips
he lands on the handle of one of the courtyard doors ki ya
ash cyclone chops the doorknob
the lock clicks
ashs eyes light up
ash drops to the ground
he digs a hole and burrows into the dirt as bullets fly everywhere
he breathes in through his nose and out through his mouth
fox watches with his jaw hanging open
the courtyard doors smash apart and the rabid beagle tears out into the vegetable garden growling foaming and thrashing crazily
the farmers shriek and scream and run around panicking with their guns blazing
fox kylie ash and kristofferson jump onto their motorcycle
the beagle rips the tail from beans neck shreds it chews it up and swallows it
fox deflates for an instant then recovers
he looks to ash on the back of the motorcycle behind him with his hands around foxs waist
he says with the deepest affection and respect ash that was pure wild animal craziness
youre an athlete
he sits up straighter
note from this point onwards an alternate version of ash will be used which is slightly taller slightly leaner and animated slightly more gracefully
fox kick starts the motorcycle and races across the farm
boggis bunce and bean scramble onto the roof of a car port with an old white mercedes convertible under it
the snarling beagle barks and snaps below them
they watch as fox steers the motorcycle toward a broken apple cart at the edge of the property
he guns the motor and yells holy swearing cuss
fox races the motorcycle up the apple cart into the air and over the concrete barricade
they land in the middle of the road skidding and speed off down the hill
boggis bunce and bean watching from the roof of the car port
boggis turns to bean and says deadpan needling him franklin
you got any final twist for this plot
bean grabs boggis by the neck and throttles him
bunce starts throwing punches
bean holds him back by the forehead
boggis kicks bunce in the stomach
they brawl chaotically while the rabid beagle continues to go bananas below them
each fox trap with a cobblestone missing underneath it and a hole in the ground
the old man with the grey moustache turns to his son and says with a strong french accent cuss
fox sits anxiously at the bottom of her ladder
badger weasel rickity the two small rabbits and the others sit exhausted in the dark cavern passing a jar of cider
mole stand by
everyone looks to mole
mole is holding the tin can with the string attached to it to his ear
he nods and says urgently i just intercepted a high frequency radio signal with the can gestures with the tin can and i think theyre on their way home
fox jumps up embraces mole and kisses him on the snout
rabbit still running full steam back into the village being pursued by the six farmhands
he comes to the manhole where they started and darts into it
the six farmhands stop at the manhole and look down
they go straight to the nags head walk inside and close the door behind them
fox kylie ash and kristofferson ride down a country road
kylie sees something across the meadow
he says warily dont turn around
fox turns around
a huge wild grey wolf with ice blue eyes stands on a rock fifty feet away from them
fox slams on the brakes
the motorcycle slides to a halt
whered he come from
whered you come from
what are you doing here
fox points toward the wolf canis lupus
fox points to himself vulpes vulpes
the wolf does not answer
fox kylie ash and kristofferson watch idling from the motorcycle
i dont think he speaks english or latin
pensez vous que hiver sera rude
im asking if he thinks were in for a hard winter
the wolf shakes his head
he doesnt seem to know
fox shouts to the wolf with a strange hitch in his i have a phobia of wolves
the wolf does not answer
it breathes heavily with its mouth open
its teeth are long sharp and yellow
its tongue hangs out and its eyes are wild
fox looks back at it with the identical expression for a minute mesmerized then fox closes his mouth and his eyes soften
fox raises his paw in the air
the wolf blinks a few times
it raises its paw in the air
it turns away and trots off into the woods
fox says wistfully what a beautiful creature
wish him luck boys
fox guns the motor
gravel spits from under the spinning tires and they tear off down the road
the shot booms down into the ground below the grass through buried pebbles layers of soil and subterranean mineral deposits
three days later fox weeks the shot continues to descend past badger and his family having dinner in a nicely furnished drain pipe past rabbit and his family watching magnum
on the stolen portable television set in a well appointed cement tunnel past beaver and mrs
beaver hosting mole and weasel for cocktails in a tasteful sewer conduit
the shot stops in a small chamber adjacent to the brick cavern
the walls are filled with electrical cables wires pipes and a large new mural which depicts the foxs former view of the valley as seen from their tree with a
trompe oeil window frame around it
it is signed felicity fox
ash and kristofferson sit indian style meditating on a braided rug
fox works mixing paints and turpentine at an easel in the corner
there is an armchair with a folded up copy of the gazette on its cushion in the center of the room under a glowing lamp
classical music plays on a radio
fox swings his head into the room from a tunnel
he says my darlings
everyone looks to fox
he signals them to follow him
the cement conduit with the iron grating above it
fox and his family walk briskly down the pipe
a knitted woolen artificial tail has been sewn into the seat of foxs trousers
where are we going
we were in the middle of a meditation practice
watch your step
fox takes everyone through an opening and starts climbing a metal ladder
he says theatrically lets see now
where does this lead
oh no foxy
keep a good grip everyone
this better be worth it
i think i see a little sliver of light
is that a door
youre a terrible actor foxy
do you smell something
is that freon
im going to crack open this trap door and see if somethings on the other side
i highly doubt it though
theres probably just more sewer
fox clears his throat
you know wouldnt it be surprising if open it
fox pushes open the trap door and crawls out
everyone follows him
fox and his family stand in the middle of an aisle at the center of a large grocery store
to their left is the refrigerated section of milk eggs meat fish and cheese
to their right are canned goods breakfast cereal laundry detergent rice pasta and condiments
the lights are half dimmed and a metal grate is closed over the front windows
there are no people
fox says casually hey look
theres a whole enormous glorious gigantic supermarket up here
ash and kristofferson seem dumbstruck
fox raises an eyebrow and smiles at mrs
she puts her arm around his shoulder
you really are kind of a quote unquote fantastic fox
i guess now that kristoffersons dads already down to single pneumonia and getting better hell be going home soon huh
actually when he spoke to me from the hospital he said he was already talking
fox contd to weasel about real estate availabil ities down in our sewer system
well nows the time to buy
kylie comes around the end of the aisle pushing a miniature shopping cart filled with jars of jelly jam olives pickles and honey plus three loaves of bread band aids
toothpaste and a carton of strawberry ice cream
he says did i hear my name
not down here you didnt
because we were talking about other things
fox looks at ash who is studying a twelve pack of tropical juice punch boxes
the white cape rather suits him doesnt it
actually i had to do quite a bit of searching myself before i found a look that really flattered me
remember those horseshoe cuff links
fox and mrs

an empty punch box lies on its side behind him with a straw sticking out of it
there is a huge purple stain all over the front of his white shirt
should we dance
everyone breaks out giddily dancing an ecstatic jig
kylie waltzes the cart in circles
fox spins mrs
a wide shot of all sixteen aisles of the supermarket stacked with boxes cartons cans bottles bags and jars of every possible variety of food
the family of foxes continues to dance at the distant end of the center aisle
boggis bunce and bean sit silently in folding metal chairs around the manhole
boggiss carbine rests across his lap
bunces shotgun hangs from a strap over his shoulder
bean cleans his luger
petey sits on a cider box outside the nags head strumming his guitar in the background
the bartender pulls the shutters shut and flips a sign on the door to closed
petey starts singing his song as the credits roll
the sun sets
the farmers sit waiting in the dark
