commentary by richard michaels the letters are in soft purple against a black background
purple is traditionally the color of that which is sacred
the black screen becomes a night sky
the camera angles lowers to show a forest against the night sky
in an opening in the forest stands a spacecraft
the view of the craft is obscured by tree branches
the atmosphere is misty with blue lights coming from the spacecraft
the opening scene is misty and diffused
this forces the audience to pay close attention to the images on the screen
the characters are not clearly seen
this engages the audience as they attempt to see what the aliens really look like
one creature walks up the gang blank and into the ship
a strange hand with two long and slender fingers protruding move aside a branch that obstructs the view
this concentrates the audiences attention
the creature going into the ship is being observed by another creature
who are they
whats going on
this is another technique that forces the audience to focus on the action
the inside of the ship appears to be a greenhouse
there are sounds of water dripping
cone shaped objects possibly alien plants sit among earth plants
vapors flow up from the plants
these images all appear non threatening
the aliens are inferred to be collecting vegetation and are thereby inferred to be harmless
like many of spielbergs other films the opening sequences contain almost no dialogue
the story is told without verbal exposition
he forces the audience to become engaged in the storytelling process by giving them just bits of information that they have to piece together into the story
he doesnt insult their intelligence
a group of the aliens work in front of the spacecraft
suddenly they hear a dog howl and they all stop working
red lights begin to glow in their chests
it appears as if their hearts have lit up at the sign of danger as the red glow seeps through their translucent skin
after a moment the red lights dim and they return to their work
this sets up the prop of the red lights signifying danger
these small creatures are endearing and non threatening
they are like children which is immediate grounds for audience empathy
the thought that they may be in danger from wild creatures in the forest also creates empathy for them
a small fern grows on the forest floor
an alien hand with two fingers protruding reaches out for the fern
the alien groans
a rabbit turns and listens
the fingers dig up the plant as the rabbit watches
the alien then carefully uproots the plant
a small wayward alien walks alone among the gigantic redwood trees
hes dwarfed by the huge trees
the awesome towering trees psychologically creates audience empathy for the creature
the audience identifies with him because they too feel small when confronted by these trees
the creature stands alone on a hilltop as he stares down at the city lights below
suddenly he lets out a moan of fright
a truck with headlights glaring pulls up next to him
the quiet peaceful alien is now in jeopardy
the creature runs from the lights
several other trucks with head lights glaring drive up
smoke flows from their exhaust pipes
mens legs are seen as they walk among the trucks
they step into a mud puddle as e
watches from behind a shrub
a man with keys jangling from his waist walks past a headlight
he carries a flashlight in his hands
keys have now become a prop which identifies the antagonist of the story the faceless government agent
like the antagonist of many other fantasy films his face is not initially revealed in order to hold the audiences attention
the man with keys walks to a truck where he and two other men review a map thats placed on the hood of the truck
the man with keys holds the flashlight up and points it at the hood
t watches them from the bushes
the fact that e
is observing the actions of the men also creates a psychological bond between the audience and him since they are also observing these characters
while the audience doesnt actually see a map they presume its existence given the actions of the characters
this style of story telling engages the audience and gets them guessing about the characters actions
they then create expectations which are later often proved to be wrong
this makes the story both unpredictable and exciting
an alien stands in front of a round light and transmits a homing signal presumably to call the other aliens back to the ship
these characters are all in jeopardy
t hears the sound his red heart lights up
the homing signal reverberates in his chest
this establishes that his heart is used as a communication device i
these aliens communicate with their hearts
keys hears this sound and quickly turns around
he points his flashlight towards the sounds
the other men join him as they walk towards the sound
screams and runs away which is indicated by the shaking bushes
the men with flashlights chase after him
so like dorothy in the wizard of oz the opening scene has the protagonist being pursued by an unknown antagonist
the lights dim on the footings of the spacecraft presumably because the spacecraft is preparing to takeoff
the protagonist has the added jeopardy of being abandoned
screams as he races for the spacecraft
the glow from his red heart reflects off the bushes as he runs towards the white light of the spacecraft
the audience still hasnt seen the face of the protagonist
a lone alien stands before a large round white light as he signals for the other aliens to return to the ship
men with flashlights run through the forest as they pursue the red glowing light racing towards the spacecraft
one of the pursuers is the man wearing the keys on his waist
the grated gangplank lifts up blocking the entrance to the ship
behind the grate stands the alien against the large round white light
the red light of the aliens heart lights up as he stands behind the barrier
this image exhibits an obstacle to e
returning to his ship
the men reach the edge of the clearing and stop as they watch the spacecraft lift off
one red lighted heart races along an old country fence towards the departing spacecraft
men with flashlights are still in pursuit
they stop at a wooden gate as they watch the spacecraft fly away
with face obstructed by a branch and with red heart aglow watches the spacecraft fly away into the night
he utters a sorrowful moan
he has been abandoned in a hostile alien world
this situation is guaranteed to generate audience empathy
the men with flashlights pointed up towards the sky watch the space craft fly away
they hear e
s groan and in unison point their flashlights in his direction
not only is the small childlike creature abandoned but he is still in jeopardy of being captured by those who pursue him
this is the inciting event in e
s story his spacecraft has deserted him
below lies the city lit up against the dark night sky
t slowly makes his way down the slope
men with flashlights follow
they reach the hilltop search the underbrush for the alien then start down the slope after him
this concludes the prelude to the story
both the protagonist and antagonist have been introduced and audience empathy has been established for the protagonist
the protagonists primary objective is to survive and find a way home while the antagonists primary objective is to capture the alien
this is an establishing shot
a group of boys are sitting around a table playing a dungeons and dragons game
one boy is on the telephone ordering a pizza
they throw wads of paper at each other as they play
elliott the youngest boy sits behind the counter
hes separated from the other boys
after a few moments he yells that hes ready to play the game
the characters positions are structured to emphasize elliotts separation from the others
one of the boys tells elliott that he cant join when they are in the middle of the game
audience empathy is generated for the young child who is being excluded from the game
elliott walks up to the table and yells at his brother mike
michael says that elliott has to ask steve who is the game master and who has absolute power
the notion of absolute power is set up here for a payoff later when elliott uses it to keep michael silent about e
elliotts objective here is to play the game but also to be accepted by the group and gain the respect of the older boys
steve tells elliott that first he has to wait for the pizza then when he brings it back he can play
steve gives him money for the pizza
elliott picks up his baseball and glove then leaves the room
the ball and glove are props that will be used in the story
elliotts sub objective is to get the pizza
once this is accomplished hell be able to play the game
its a rainy misty night
elliott with ball and glove in hand wait at the bottom of the driveway for the pizza
a car pulls up and parks in the driveway
elliott pays the driver then takes the pizza box from him as the car pulls out of the driveway
elliott walks up the driveway and into the garage
he hears a noise in the backyard then calls out the name harvey presumably his dogs name
elliotts mother wears an orange outfit as she works in the kitchen
she bends over to put dishes into the dishwasher
when she does this one of the young boys reaches out to put his finger on her rear
mike yells for him to stop
he pulls his finger away
elliot walks past the ping pong table when he hears more noises in the backyard
again he calls out the name harvey
this generates tension and suspense in the audience
with the pizza box in hand elliot walks past the patio table and towards the shed in the backyard
a bright crescent moon hangs in the night sky
this adds enchantment to the scene
there is a mist in the air and a bright light shines in the shed
elliott places the pizza box on the ground as he approaches the shed
hes still carrying the baseball and glove as he stands in front of the sheds entrance
he tosses the ball into the shed
after a few seconds the ball is tossed back out at him and hits him on the foot
this is the payoff to the setup of the baseball prop
this event surprises both elliott and the audience
elliott becomes frightened turns and steps on the pizza box as he runs towards the house
this is the inciting event in elliotts story there is some creature hiding out in his shed that will change his whole life
elliotts mother is talking to the boys when elliott runs into the house screaming that theres something in the tool shed
he tells them that it threw a ball at him but they continue to ignore him until he screams quiet
nobody go out there says elliott
the boys immediately jump up from the table
two boys grab kitchen knives as michael tells his mother to stay inside
he and his friends will check it out
she yells at them to put the knives back as she follows them outside
the light is still on in the shed
elliotts mother walks into the yard with a flashlight in her hand
she is surrounded by the boys as they approach the shed
the mother says that theres nothing in there as michael walks through the entrance
michael bends down and finds tracks on the dirt floor
the coyotes come back again ma
his mother becomes frightened and orders them all back into the house
jeopardy is introduced into the situation
even though the audience knows that it is probably the alien in the shed the scene increases the tension
on his way back to the house michael sees the pizza box
he bends down opens the box then takes out a piece
hes angry at elliott
elliott tries to explain that it was just an accident but his brother is still angry
when the mother asks who ordered the pizza elliott points to one of mikes friends
this makes the friend mad at elliott
elliot tries to persuade his mother that there is a creature in the shed but she doesnt believe him
they walk into the house
empathy is generated for elliott because the two boys are unfairly angry at him and his mother doesnt believe him
the aliens fingers point out into the shed entrance then wrap around the side of the door
the sound of his heavy breathing is heard
this establishes for the audience that he really is in the shed
they feel sorry for elliott because he was telling the truth and no one believed him
the clock on the end table indicates
next to the clock is a picture of a dog presumably harvey
this same dog lies asleep in the bed
he hears a noise and picks up his head
he is in the lower half of a bunk bed
on the top bunk sits elliott
he is awake as he listens to the noise outside
elliotts objective is to prove theres a creature in the shed
elliott opens a gate and walks into the backyard
he carries a flashlight in his hand and shines it into the cornfield next to his house
he walks into the field
elliott walks into the cornfield
he whistles and gets entangled in the cornstalks as he walks
he sees tracks in the dirt with his baseball nearby
he continues to walk through the field
the stalks are obstacles that obstruct both his path and his vision
it also clutters the visuals and forces the audience to pay closer attention
the suspense increases because they arent sure whether hell meet up with the alien or the coyote
elliott pushes aside some stalks and shines the light into the face of e
together in unison the scream
elliot drops his light then continues to scream as he looks around the field
cries out and runs away through the cornfield
their reactions upon seeing each other were identical
this is the first instance of a series of situations which will merge their characters to such an extent that whatever empathy the audience has for one they will also
have for the other
elliott runs into his backyard
his play swings sway back and forth in the air as if someone had just bumped into them
two garbage pails fall over near an open metal gate at the top of a stone stairway
the garbage rolls out of the cans and down the stone stairs
a red light by the gate lights the stone stairway
the audience psychologically associates this red light with e
s red lighted heart and makes the inference that he had run up the staircase and out the gate
elliott has an expression of wonderment and gratification on his face as he looks up the staircase for he has just established the existence of the creature in the shed
elliott rides down the driveway on his bicycle
he next rides down a dirt road that overlooks the suburban community
elliotts new objective is to locate the creature
elliott holds a bag of candy in one hand as he pours some into the other hand
he tosses candy onto the round as he walks through the woods calling out for the creature
in another part of the woods elliott lays his bike down then continues to toss candy and yell out hello
he sees a man on the road below and quickly hides behind a tree
keys the faceless antagonist is still pursuing the alien
elliott runs back to his bike then rides down the forest road past a wire fence
the aliens fingers side down the side to the tree
he was watching elliott
elliott is in jeopardy both from the faceless man and the faceless alien
elliotts mother sits at the tale with the dog harvey at her side
elliott michael and gertie are eating supper
this is a home without a father which creates more empathy for the protagonist
gertie asks elliott what hes going as for halloween
hes depressed and replies that hes not going
mike mocks him by suggesting that he go as a goblin
elliott snaps back telling mike to shut up
the mother tries to explain that its not that they dont believe him but elliott cries out that the creature was real
the audience also knows that the creature is real
this generates more empathy for the protagonist because he is mocked and not believed when he is expressing the truth
mike offers other suggestions perhaps it was an iguana a deformed child or maybe an elf or a leprechaun
elliott gets angry and shouts it was nothing like that penis breath
mary his mother shouts at him to sit down
elliott responds with dad would believe me
mary replies maybe you ought to call your father and tell him about it
hes in mexico with sally says elliott
both mary and mike are upset while gertie asks wheres mexico
mary excuses herself and leaves the table
she walks to the window as mike tells elliott that hes going to kill him
if you ever see it again dont touch it
just call me and well have someone come and take it away says mary
like the dog catcher
but theyll give it a lobotomy or do experiments on it or something says elliott
this sets up the audiences expectations about the harm that will befall the alien when he is captured
after a bit of dialogue concerning who should be doing the dishes mary leaves the room saying he hates mexico
this scene explores the emotional relationships between the family members in greater detail
empathy is also generated for mary who was abandoned by her husband
she is left with the responsibility of raising the children while hes traveling with his new girlfriend to mexico a country which he hates
elliott takes some dishes to the sink turns on the faucet and gazes out the kitchen window as water steams up from the sink
a crescent moon floats in the sky
a bright light is on in the shed
in front of the shed elliott lies inside a sleeping bag on a folding chair with a flashlight in his hand
he hears the sound of feet walking in the underbrush
elliott sits up to see the alien standing in front of the shed
the alien groans as elliott freezes from fear in his chair
he tries to call out for his mother but cant get the words out of his mouth
he next tries to call mike but fear makes him choke on his words
the alien approaches elliott
the bright light from the shed makes it impossible to see his face only the outline of his form is visible
the alien walks right up to the edge of the lawn chair
the scene is filled with suspense because elliott may be in jeopardy from the creature
the alien slowly moves its hand over the chair then drops candies onto the blanket
this non verbal gesture by e
demonstrates that he is harmless
the tension in the scene is thereby released
elliott has achieved his objective he established contact with the alien
elliott places candy on the carpet then walks backwards down the hallway towards his room
walks up the stairs and reaches out for the candy which he then takes into his hand and eats
elliotts new objective is to get the alien into his room
his main obstacles are to somehow persuade the alien to come into the house while not waking his family
this scene also is a good example of how to structure a scenes beginning
in real life the scene would have started in the backyard tracked through the kitchen the living room and then up the stairs
but since all of that information would have been redundant picking the action up from the top of the stairs was sufficient
elliott places candy on the floor by the entrance to his room
a sign on his door contains the word enter
t picks up the candy
elliott has run out of candy
he goes to his desk in search for more
he opens some drawers but doesnt find any
when he returns to the doorway e
has already entered the room
pulls a box down from the table then knocks a can filled with pens onto the floor
this makes a loud noise and forces elliott to quickly close the door to his room
the audience still does not have a clear view of e
s face nor body
this holds their attention during the scene
they are waiting for that wonderful moment
elliott throws a blanket over e
as they stare at each other
is finally revealed to the audience
elliott moves his hand in front of his face a gesture indicating bewilderment
mimics this action
this is the beginning of their efforts to communicate but also the start of the audience emotionally identifying the two characters as one object of empathy
elliott places his fingers to his lips to see if e
will respond in the same manner which he does
elliott then places one finger to his ear which e
elliott smiles then holds his left hand up with all five fingers spread apart
raises his left hand with three fingers spread apart
elliott closes his fingers until there is only one remaining up
does the same
they both wiggle this one finger
a poster on the wall between elliott and e
has the word superstar printed on it
these actions help the audience to conceive of these two characters as mirror images of one another worthy of equal empathy
it also bonds the young children in the audience to them because the characters are speaking in a language they too can understand
all the children in the audience have just been through the experience of learning a language
they can easily identify with the problems that that two characters in the story are having in communicating with each other
this forges a bond between the children and both elliott and e
this also forms the basis for the repeat viewing of this film which was essential for its phenomenal box office success
suddenly elliott becomes tired and yawns then sways as if in a trance
he slowly walks backwards and sits down in a chair
elliott seems asleep as the camera moves up for a closeup of elliotts face
has used his telepathic powers to place elliott into a trance in order to merge their minds and feelings
this is the end of the first act
elliott has succeeded in gaining possession of the dramatic objective e
and has him in his room
has also taken possession of elliott by merging their feelings so that they both become one protagonist
the second act will end when they are both captured by the antagonist
mist envelops the fence and gate in the section of the forest where e
t originally landed
men with flashlights and floodlights search throughout the area
keys walks into the forefront holding a flashlight in his hand
he bends to the ground and finds some candy
the objective of the faceless antagonist is to capture the alien
the candy is a prop that will lead them to elliotts house just as elliott used them to lead e
into his room
this scene shows that the protagonist is in jeopardy because he is still being pursued
elliott lies in bed with a thermometer in his mouth
his head rests on an orange pillow same color as his mothers dress in the first scene while his mother sits besides him
she takes out the thermometer reads it then says okay youre hot
she then leaves the room
elliott quickly swings a lamp back over his head and heats the thermometer
he also places a blue heating pad over his face to heat himself
he then places the thermometer back into his mouth swings the lamp away and places the heating pad under the covers as his mother enters the room
she opens his closet and separates the hanging clothes as she walks into the closet
elliott sits up in bed and intensely watches her
elliotts objective is to stay home from school in order to be with e
his obstacle is his mother who wants him to go to school
to overcome this obstacle he must persuade her that hes sick
a crisis occurs when she enters the closet in which e
this creates jeopardy for the protagonist
mike backs the car down the driveway
mary walks out of the closet carrying a blue sleeping bag
elliott is tense then relieved once he realizes that she didnt find e
he falls back into bed
mike backs the car over part of the lawn
this scene functions not only as comic relief but also as a set up for the scene here mike has to drive the van during e
s escape sequence
this demonstrates both his incompetence and that he is only allowed to drive the car backwards down the driveway
mary covers elliott with the blue sleeping bag as elliott puts the thermometer back into his mouth first backwards then he corrects it
humor is generated because the audience knows that he is fooling his mother
mike continues to back the car down the driveway
he overshoots the edge and goes out into the street
he then pulls forward across the sidewalk
you were outside waiting for that thing
elliott is covered in blue white colors which traditionally signify innocence and which generates audience empathy for him
she tells him not to watch tv kisses him then leaves the room
elliott quickly closes the blinds
mary runs down the driveway towards the car
gertie points out the patches of lawn that mike pulled onto the driveway as he was driving the car
mary pulls her into the car
elliott gestures for e
to walk out of the closet which he does
he is wearing elliotts robe
elliott asks him if he talks
elliotts objective is to communicate with e
his obstacle is that e
does not speak the english language
elliott elliott elliott says elliott
turns away and walks towards the work table
elliott picks up objects such as a can of coke and toy soldiers from the table then names them for e
elliott points to the fish and explains how the fish eat the fish food
he places a wooden toy shark into the fishbowl then states that the shark eats the fish but nobody eats the shark
in his effort to communicate with e
elliott tries to teach him the language by showing him objects that are used in everyday life
this process is similar to that experienced by the children and parents in the audience everyday as they also learn and attempt to communicate with each other
this type of scene solidifies the audiences emotional bonding with elliott and e
takes a toy car into his mouth on chews on it
like many a child would
elliott takes this to mean that e
elliott tells e
to stay where he is
elliotts new objective is to get food for e
elliott opens the door and harvey tries to run into the room
groans with fear and backs into a corner as elliott pulls harvey out of the room
this introduces jeopardy into the scene for harvey could harm e
elliott dressed only in white underwear opens the refrigerator door and takes out some food
walks around the room
elliott opens up a jar of peanut butter
touches a tennis racket
elliott picks up cheese and tomatoes
picks up an umbrella
elliott takes a carton of milk out of the refrigerator
accidentally opens up the umbrella
elliott screams with fright and drops the milk carton onto the floor
screams with fright drops the umbrella then runs into the closet
this further establishes the merging of e
and elliott into one being
elliott shares e
s feelings and simultaneously experiences what he experiences
the audience also experiences this surprise with them which further tightens the bonds
milk flows from the open carton onto the floor as elliott leans into the open refrigerator
he clutches his chest and looks up towards the ceiling as he ponders his experience
elliott carries a plate of food into the room
he walks past the open umbrella and looks into the closet
stuffed animals line the back of the closet wall
pushes the animals forward
he was hiding behind them
he is still shaking from the fright experience
are you okay
too much excitement huh
you want a coke
this is the resolution of the last scene sequence
we see both characters reactions to the events that have occurred
michael runs up the driveway towards his house
hes wearing a red football blazer
michael opens the front door and runs into the house
he takes off his red shirt to reveal the blue shirt hes wearing underneath
he picks up a magazine then opens the refrigerator
nothing but health shit he says as he takes out a can and shakes it
the audience tenses up because jeopardy has just been introduced into the story
they wonder what will happen when mike discovers e
in elliotts bedroom
elliott walks away from his closet and opens the door to his room
he tells mike to come in
both boys are dressed in blue and white colors
mike calls elliott a faker then starts to tell him about scores on an asteroid game when elliott interrupts to tell him about the goblin
michael makes fun of elliott and his belief that the goblin has returned
but elliott persists and makes mike promise to give elliott absolute power
this is the payoff to the absolute power concept as set up during the dungeon and dragons scene
elliotts objective is to vindicate himself to his brother and sister by proving that the goblin e
really does exist
ellott makes mike close his eyes then he retrieves e
from the closet and leads him to the center of the room
mike has a silly grin on his face as he opens his eyes and turns around to look at e
a sickening look of terror comes over his face
suddenly gertie opens the door and walks into the room with her doll under her arm saying elliott look what i made for you
sees her then stretches his neck to raise his head high
gertie walks right up to him and screams
screams back at her
elliott screams for both of them to stop
mike falls back against the wall and knocks down the bookcase
they all scream together
elliott grabs gerties mouth and pushes her back to mike
kids im home shouts mary from downstairs
the mother an adult is about to discover e
even though they are terrified the children all band together against the threat
theyd rather sit in the closet with the monster than have their mother discover him
mike quickly shuts the door then they all run to the closet
gertie screams again
mike grabs her by the mouth and pulls her away as e
runs across the room with his arms raised
elliott shuts the closet door just as his mother walks into his room
mary notices the fallen bookcase
she looks around and then comments this is no room this is an accident
elliot tries to cover by saying he was reorganizing
s head appears among the stuffed animals
mike has his hand over gerties mouth as she tries to scream
mary walks past the closet door
this creates suspense in the audience will e
be discovered by mary
mary asks elliot to keep an eye on gertie while she takes a shower
she kisses him on the head then leaves the room
elliott opens the closet door
michael in awe with mouth open wide watches as elliott approaches e
elliott whispers mike
im keeping him says elliott
sits behind the stuffed animals as if he was one of them
the use of stuffed animals as props around e
t helps to transfer positive feelings that the audience has for them to e
gertie asks what it is as she and michael approach e
elliott tells her that it wont hurt her
when asked if its a boy or girl elliott replies that its a boy
he then tells her that she cant tell mom about the creature
when asked why not he explains that grownups cant see him
only little kids can see him
gertie snaps back give me a break
the charm in gerties character lies in the contradictory attributes of being a sophisticated child
humor is generated by this incongruity
elliott then goes into his dracula voice then do you know what will happen if you do tell
he grabs gerties doll tosses it to mike and tells him to do it
mike tortures the doll by twisting its arm
gertie cries as she runs to it
watches the scene with wonderment in his eyes
gertie finally promises not to tell about e
they all watch him as he stretches his neck and lifts up his head
on the hilltop overlooking the neighborhood stands a man with a camera as he takes photos of the houses below
the man with keys on his waist walks into the area as other men comb the ground with electronic equipment
jeopardy is introduced in the scene in order to maintain tension in the audience
the antagonist is getting closer to the home of the protagonist
this is an establishing shot
mary carrying a yellow watering pail walks across the room and waters a large plant
gertie pulls a little red wagon into the hallway
when asked by mary what shes doing gertie replies that shes going to play in elliotts room
okay dont let them torture you says the mother
i wont mary replies gertie
this generates humor because the child deals with the mother as if they are equals
gertie picks up a pot containing a sickly geranium plant and places it into the wagon
the phone rings and mary answers it off screen
the plant becomes an important prop because in the story it will represent the health and well being of e
gertie knocks on the door
mike lets her and harvey into the room
they walk to the table where e
and elliott are sitting
gertie puts the sickly plant n the table
puts his finger into the plant
elliott opens up an encyclopedia and points to california on a map of the united states
we are here elliott says as e
munches on celery
michael hands elliott a globe and tells him to use this instead of the map
elliott points to the globe then asks e
where hes from
points out the window
elliotts objective is to discover more about the alien
elliott opens the book to a page that has the map of a galaxy
he points to the planet earth touches the globe then says home home
makes a soft noise that sounds similar to the word home
gertie watches him as he picks up round objects and places them on the map three small pieces of fruit and two eggs
s eyes concentrate on the table which then starts to shake
the two eggs and three small pieces of fruit then lift off the table and float in the air
the children watch with awe
this introduction of magical powers that e
possesses was unexpected and thereby helps to make the story unpredictable
elliott screams with fright and the floating objects drop to the floor
he walks to a lamp and stares into it
mike asks what is wrong
i dont know
something scary says elliott as e
places his finger on elliotts shoulder
jeopardy is introduced into the scene with this comment
yet it is not e
who is to be feared as indicated by his comforting gesture of placing his finger on elliotts shoulder
elliott runs by the shed past a swaying swing up the stairs to the red lamppost and to the wire gate
he strains to hear the sounds of men talking
the antagonist is getting closer to the home of the protagonist
sits next to a lamp as he reads a childs abc book
he sits next to a raggedy ann doll
another image of e
learning the language which helps to forge a bond between him and children in the audience
good feelings for the doll are also transferred to the alien
on the floor next to e
is the pot containing the sickly flowers
he looks at the flowers makes a moaning sound and suddenly they become healthy and transform into full bloom
this establishes the magical healing powers of e
elliott and mike walk down the driveway
they are on their way to school
they discuss e
arguing about how smart he is
this is just a transition scene
mike and elliot walk towards a bus stop where a group of children are waiting
mikes friends torment elliott about his goblin
this generates more audience empathy for elliott who is unfairly mocked by the ignorant boys
elliott still has not earned the respect of mikes friends which is one of his dreams
they finally get on the bus as elliott walks away followed by a pretty blonde girl who seems to have a crush on him
michael appears worried as he sits on the bus among the other children who are throw ing objects at each other
gertie stands on the stairway looking up presumably thinking about e
in elliotts room
mary comes running downstairs and tells gertie that they have to get into the car otherwise theyll be late
suddenly mary hears a noise upstairs
she goes up to see what caused the sound
is in danger of being discovered by an adult
the audiences expectations were shaped in the earlier dinner scene where mary told the children she would call to have the creature taken away if he came around the house
this is what the audience expects her to do if she finds e
mary walks into the closet and looks around
the camera pans across the large faces of all the stuffed dolls raggedy ann a bear a monkey e
s face a lion etc
mary doesnt notice e
then closes the closet door and leaves
humor is generated because of the incongruity of a living creature among the dolls and the inability of mary to distinguish between them
the laughter releases the tension that was created in the previous scene
this also reinforces the audiences emotional ties to e
since he is so doll like
a teacher walks down the aisle and announces to the class that today they will perform the frog dissection for which they have been preparing
as he passes elliotts desk he starts to say frogs similar to then he notices the drawing of e
the teacher picks it up
elliott turns to see the pretty blonde girl staring at him
realizing shes been caught she quickly turns and looks away
this attraction to elliott is set up in order to payoff before the end of the school sequence
opens the door to elliotts room and walks out into the hallway
harvey sees and quickly approaches
jeopardy will the dog attack e
at there last encounter e
was frightened by harvey
the teacher continues his instructions telling the students that the scalpel is very sharp and that they should use discretion when cutting
there should be very little blood and maybe a little body fluids
this exposition of the plans sets up the audiences expectations which later will not be fulfilled
this is a standard structure used to generated excitement and unpredictability in a story
wearing a blue flannel shirt walks into the kitchen with harvey at his side
he opens the refrigerator
harvey licks his lips as he watches in anticipation of getting something to eat
takes out a plastic container of potato salad opens it then sticks his tongue into the salad
he hates the taste and throws it onto the floor
harvey licks it up
then picks up a can of beer and drinks it as harvey barks
elliott sits at his desk as he listens to the teacher speak
all the children in the classroom stare at him
this again shows the merging of elliott and e
drunk wobbles across the kitchen floor and walks into a counter
elliott places his fingers to his head
he is also becoming drunk
the teacher tells the class that in this bisection they should locate the heart and notice that it is still beating
the red lit heart is the most prominent feature of e
having the teacher focus on the frogs heart starts the identification in the audiences mind of the frogs and e
turns and walks into another wall as harvey continues to eat the potato salad on the floor
elliott now drunk slides down in his chair
turns walks then collapses head first onto the floor
elliott slides under his desk and falls onto the floor
the teacher doesnt hear this because at that moment he pulls down a wall hanging which contains pictures of a frogs anatomy
opens another can of beer
elliott pulls himself up off the floor with a drunken smile on his face
gulps down another can of beer
elliott drunk sits at his desk
he turns and smiles at the pretty blonde girl across the aisle
she turns away from him with disgust
plays on the keys of a voice generating language game
he next presses a button on a remote control which activates the tv set
a cartoon appears with a cat getting its tail caught on fire
the cat screams and e
t reacts with horror
he throws the beer can at the tv set
laughter is generated for while this under normal circumstances would be inappropriate behavior he makes sense given e
s point of view
he then presses another button on the remote and the image of a flying plane appears on the screen
a spaceship next appears and pulls the plane up towards it
the teacher carries a jar of cotton balls soaked in chloroform which he drops into the jars containing frogs
he tells the children to immediately put the lids on the jars
after telling the children that this wont hurt the frogs he places a cotton ball into the last two jars one of which belongs to elliott
elliott doesnt place the cover on his jar but instead sadly watches as the frog tries to escape
slowly he places to lid on it as he gazes at the frog
can you talk
can you talk
can you say hi
elliott is making an emotional identification of the frog with e
by attempting the same process of communication
the situation also creates expectations in the audience that similar things will happen to e
once he is captured
a cinematic technique which reinforces the identification of the frog with e
this sets up the audience for e
they expect the frog to die and they project these expectations to e
later in the story
has a hangover as he hiccups and puts his hand on his head
he then picks up the cartoon section of a newspaper
one cartoon strip has a picture of a communication device with a caption stating help help
on the tv monitor a woman is talking long distance n her telephone to her uncle ralph in california
hears the sounds coming from the tv then turns to look at the monitor where he sees a man talking into a phone in his hand
the camera pans to a phone near e
a child in the tv program picks up the phone says hello to his uncle then hangs up
this generates laughter because its inappropriate behavior to just say hello then hang up
looks closer at the buck rogers cartoon
one cell has an image of a man in a spacesuit setting up a transmitter
the next cell has him saying it works as the communication device transmits help help
lifts up his head from the newspaper
save him shouts elliott
elliott picks up his jar unscrews the top then lets out his frog screaming run for your life
back to the forest
another merging of e
and elliotts feelings and thoughts
presumably had the feeling of wanting to be saved by his friends and this feeling prompted elliott to cry out
he next opens the jar of the girl besides him
elliott struggles with one student then proceeds to turn over many of the other jars as he frees the frogs
some of the other children also free their frogs
studies the electronic circuitry of the language game
suddenly john wayne comes on the screen
is fascinated with his image
its a scene from the movie quiet man
maureen osullivan huddles in a corner of the room
a pile of frogs gather at the feet of a terrified little girl with blonde braids
elliott drunk staggers by her
continues to watch the tv monitor as the woman in the movie screams
a blonde girl who has a crush on elliott screams when a frog is placed on her shoes
the woman in the movie runs out the door
john wayne grabs hold of her arm
elliott grabs hold of the blonde girl as she runs out the door
john wayne pulls the woman back
elliott pulls the blonde girl back
john wayne takes the woman into his arms
elliott takes the blonde girl into his arms
john wayne kisses the woman
elliott too short to kiss her stands on the back of a student who was crawling on the floor after a frog
elliott kisses the girl
filled with fascination watches the tv monitor
the childrens hands poke through the windows and free the frogs by throwing them out onto the grass
elliott was able to accomplish his objective of freeing the frogs
this sequence was structured to run in parallel in order to emphasize the merging of elliott and e
a blanket containing aluminum foil electrical toys and appliances is pulled across the floor
mary opens the door and yells hello
harvey runs to the front door
t walks out from behind the tv and kicks beer cans across the floor
the alien quickly learns the appropriate behavior for drinking at home
mary with her arms filled with grocery bags and clothes from the cleaners walks into the kitchen
she is followed by gertie who sees e
t standing near the refrigerator
mary opens the refrigerator door and knocks e
in the head
he falls backwards onto the floor
gertie helps e
up off the floor
he walks past mary as he goes back to the refrigerator
mary still doesnt see him
this increases the audiences tension
they are expecting e
to be discovered by mary and they are expecting her to scream
gertie keeps telling her that she wants mary to meet somebody but mary ignores her as she talks about how much the price of food has gone up in one
grabs a can of coffee from the kitchen table then again walks past mary as she goes in the opposite direction
he goes back into the tv room
the laughters produced by marys failure to see the reality of the alien whos right under her nose
gertie is watching a language teaching program for children on the tv
the program is teaching words that begin with the letter b
the phone rings as mary accidentally kicks a can of beer across the floor
she answers the phone with the beer can in her hand
the person on the phone tells mary that elliott is intoxicated
gertie watching the tv monitor responds to the program by practicing the b words
pokes his head up from behind the monitor and says bbbbbbb
gertie stares at him as he repeats the b sound then lowers his head back down below the tv
you said b says gertie
b repeats e
you said b good says gertie
good repeats e
this is a set up for the closing communication between e
and gertie before he flies away in the spacecraft
this is also the first moment that he spoke an english word
many children and parents in the audience can identify with this moment and the first moral precept usually taught to a child be good
mary hangs up the phone and tells gertie that she has to pick up elliott
she asks gertie to be a good girl
mommy he can talk says gertie
of course he can talk says mary referring to the tv program
the humor is generated from marys misunderstanding of gerties statement
as mary leaves e
walks out from behind the tv
he walks to a phone and stares
phone says mary
phone says e
presses the numbers of the phone
you want to call somebody
this establishes e
s objective to communicate with his fellow creatures so that he can return home
elliott walks up the stairs to his room
marys voice can be heard from below saying she refuses to pay for frogs
this is a fine example of the point of attack for a scene instead of showing what would happen in real life marys discussions with the teacher about elliotts behavior
in the classroom the scene picks up with what is important for the audience elliotts discovery that e
can now talk
a scene showing mary in school would be redundant and dramatically irrelevant
elliott is walking towards his room when he hears gertie talking to e
in her room
he drops his bags on the floor and quickly enters her room
be good be good says gertie as she closes the doors to her closet
elliott pushes gertie away from the closet and opens it
inside is e
dressed up in girl clothes with a blonde wig on his head
he has a rabbit fur around his neck and wears a black hat with flowers
this is completely inappropriate attire for an alien whether male or female
the visual incongruity of e
in girls clothes generates the laughter
elliott says e
says elliott not yet realizing that it was e
elliott elliott repeats e
i taught him how to talk
he can talk now says gertie
elliott with the help of gertie and the tv program has completed one of elliotts objectives communicating with e
gertie points out the things that e
has brought upstairs electrical toys and the plant
she wonders what he needs this for
holds the cartoon page of the newspaper out to elliott
can you say that
can you say e
elliott laughs with joy
t keeps repeating his name as he turns and walks through the closet into elliotts room
be good says e
be good i taught him that too says gertie
be good is a fundamental value taught children as basic as the principle theres no place like home taught in the wizard of oz
you should give him his dignity
this is the most ridiculous thing ive ever seen says elliott
hands elliott the newspaper and points to the buck rodgers comic strip
he then says phone
elliott is amazed at this
walks into the closet and says home
elliott confirms that this is e
then turns walks to the window points to the sky and says e
phone home says gertie
phone home says elliott
he wants to call somebody says gertie
this reconfirms e
mike walks into the room and laughs at e
phone home says e
oh my god hes talking now says mike
once again points out the window and repeats that he wants to call home
and theyll come
home home he repeats
a truck drives down the street
inside a man with earphones listens to the conversations in the neighborhood homes as he fine tunes his electronic eavesdropping equipment
he focuses in on elliotts voice
jeopardy the forces of the antagonist are getting closer and closer
they are now inside the privacy of the protagonists home listening to their most intimate conversations
elliott mike and harvey are in the garage searching for objects that e
could use in building his communications device
elliott restates that he has absolute power and that e
belongs to him
elliotts objective is to possess e
not set him free
freeing the one he loves is the lesson he will have to learn in this story
the van containing electronic eavesdropping equipment drives past elliotts house
they are still in jeopardy their actions and words are being monitored
mike tells elliott that e
doesnt look too good anymore
dont say that were fine
whats all this we stuff
you say we all the time now
look elliott i think he might be getting sick replies michael
this confirms elliotts belief that he considers himself and e
to be one being
it also introduces further jeopardy for e
besides being tracked by the antagonist he is also becoming sick
the man with the earphones is listening to elliott and michaels conversation as they discuss e
mike tells elliott to grab the fuzzbuster
elliott pulls his fathers blue shirt out from the shelf
they reminisce about the days when he used to take them to baseball games and the movies where they would have baseball fights
mike says that theyll do that again but elliott doesnt really believe him
they each smell their fathers shirt
old spice says mike
sea breeze says elliott
here a prop their fathers shirt is used to reveal the emotional relationships between the two boys and their father
audience empathy is generated for them because they have been abandoned by their father
the audiences anger is transferred from the father to the antagonist who is eavesdropping on this private intimate moment
the man in the van continues to listen to elliott and michaels conversation
only the listeners eye is clearly visible
this is a cinematic technique to signify the ever watching eye of the faceless antagonist
mary lies in bed next to gertie as she reads her the peter pan story
mary reads that peter has defeated the indians but wendy and the boys have been captured by the pirates
he vows to rescue her
watches them from the closet
here the notion of a rescue is introduced and visually associated with e
as he watches them from the closet
this is an emotional set up for the audience so that they will later be supportive of elliott and the boys efforts to rescue e
mary reads the section of the peter pan story where tinker bell becomes poisoned
elliott comes into the closet stands next to e
then closes the door behind them
tinkerbell swallows the draft as peters hand reaches for it reads mary
why t you have drunk my medicine
elliott pulls e
away from the door then shifts through a box of items that he brought up from the garage
he cuts his finger on the blade of a power saw then says ouch as he holds his bleeding finger up into the air
points his own finger towards elliott
s finger glows like a laser light as he says ouch
he then presses this lit finger on elliotts cut and heals it
this establishes the fundamental goodness and healing power of e
opens the slit in the closet door and continues to watch mary read to gertie the part where tinker bell is dying
she says she thinks she can get well again if children believe in fairies
do you believe in fairies
say quick that you believe
if you believe clap your hands
both gertie and mary clap their hands
elliott places a blanket around e
s shoulders and a scarf around his neck as they listen to the rest of the story
thank you thank you
and now to rescue wendy reads mary
elliott places his arm around e
the peter pan story is used to set up the audiences emotional reactions to a fairy tale concerning near death and rescue
this emotional empathy will then be transferred to e
another fairy like creature when he becomes sick and is rescued
just as the audience felt like clapping for tinker bell they will applaud the childrens efforts to save e
exhaust flows from the tailpipe of a van
this is the same type of poisonous exhaust image that the audience saw when vans drove into the forest at the beginning of the movie
jeopardy the forces of the antagonist are still nearby
elliott dressed in white long johns sits on his bunkbed as he watches e
michael stands next to him
elliott comments that e
is putting together his instrument while mike fears that it might blow up the house
he also comments on the irregularity of e
more jeopardy both in mikes fears of his family and home being destroyed and in e
s illness becoming progressively worse
t places his communication device over the buck rodgers comic strip
this movement establishes a mental association between the device and the spacemans communication efforts in the comic strip
petals drop off the flower in the pot
this represents e
s failing health
lifts up his head which indicates hes using his telekinetic powers then lifts part of his communication device into the air
he next lifts up the umbrella and opens it
both objects float in the air in front of him
ts primary objective is to go home
to accomplish this he must create a communication device
this is his sub objective which appears to be completed
he next must activate this device from the landing site and call home
the obstacles he has to overcome are mary the community and the distance to the forest
these obstacles will be confronted in the next scenes
preparing for halloween elliott paints his lips with makeup
he talks to gertie about her going out that night as a ghost
they review the evening plans
she will meet them at the lookout
this is an example of incomplete exposition which engages the audience
they only talk about part of the plan the meeting at the lookout
they dont discuss anymore details such as deceiving mary into thinking that gertie is with them instead of e
the partial information forces the audience to stay involved with the action and to create their own conjectures about what will happen
mike helps elliot put on his knapsack
elliott then places a sheet over e
covered with a sheet and clown shoes walks down the staircase
the clown shoes cover his three toed feet
mary walks through the house dressed in a tight fitting leopard skin dress with facial makeup that makes her look like a cat
mike tells his mother to wait and not peek as he and elliott lead e
into the room
finally mary turns and shrieks with glee
she runs to get a camera
the tension in the situation is caused by their fear that e
will be discovered by mary
mike and elliotts objective is to get him out of the house undiscovered
looks through holes cut out for his eyes and sees michael with a fake butcher knife through his head
he lights up his finger in an attempt to heal mikes wound
mike grabs e
s hand and puts it back under the sheet
ouch ouch says e
t as he tries once again to heal mike
its a fake knife its fake says mike
laughter is generated because while e
s behavior would be appropriate if mike was really wounded it is inappropriate in this situation since the knife is fake
mary comes back with a camera and prepares to photograph them
you look great says mary
thank you says mike
thank you says elliott
thank you says e
mary doesnt notice that e
laughter is generated by the rule of three humor structure and marys ignorance
when mary takes the photo the flash shocks e
and knocks him onto the floor
mike and elliott quickly pull him up before mary notices and lead him out of the house
they succeed in their objective with the help of their not so smart mother
mary walks down the driveway as she orders them to be home no later than one hour after sundown
dressed in the sheet turns and looks at mary then continues down the driveway with mike and elliott
this creates a timelock a sense of urgency and the expectation of an upset mother if they havent returned by the assigned time
establishing shot of the neighborhood
on a hilltop by a fence stands another person in a white sheet presumably gertie
she kicks dirt at the bicycle near the fence
this is the end objective of mike elliot and e
to connect up with gertie at the lookout
their obstacle is to get e
t past all the children on the streets
the sun is setting
children in halloween costumes walk through the streets
walks between mike and elliott as he watches the other children parade by
one child dressed as yoda from return of the jedi walks by
turns and walks after him saying home home
the laughter is obviously the result of e
misinterpreting the situation by believing that the child is another alien
they walk towards the setting sun as mike reminds elliott that he must be back by one hour after sunset
elliott promises to try but he wants mike to cover for him
this creates jeopardy for the characters because if they dont complete their mission within the time frame they will have trouble with mary
the sun is setting as mike elliott and two small characters covered with sheets stand on the hilltop overlooking the city
elliott asks mike to help him lift e
onto the bike
mike does and then tells elliott that they will be waiting for him
they have reached this objective
the next objective for elliott and e
t is to get to the landing site in the forest
elliott with e
t sitting in the front basket rides his bicycle through the forest
the road becomes very bumpy
elliott tells e
that they will have to walk from there
takes control of the bike through the use of his telekinetic powers and speeds it forward
eliott becomes frightened as e
speeds the bike towards a cliff and then drives it over the edge
then makes the bike up through the air
the audience gulps from suspense and then goes into elation by this surprising and magical turn of events
they continue to fly over the tree tops
elliott yells not so high not so high
t and elliott both have white hoods over their heads which further visually reinforces their identification
they ride across the front of the moon the guiding light of magic
elliott laughs with glee
when they start their descent he begs e
not to crash
they hit the ground
the bike turns over and both e
and elliott are thrown to the ground
the grandfather clock indicates
mary watches the clock as she sits in front of lighted candles
the time has long passed when elliott was supposed to be home
the lighted candles give a church like effect as if mary was praying for the safety of her children
she is upset that they havent returned
she blows out the candles then taps out another candle with her wand
there is jeopardy for the children as mary and the audience wonder if they are okay
empathy is generated for mary who is truly concerned for the safety of her children
the sun has set
its nighttime in the forest
t opens a box which contains the saw blade brought to him by elliott
elliott ties a rope up to a tree branch
he then opens the umbrella which is lined with aluminum foil and points it towards the star filled sky
it will function as a transmitter
places a coat hanger with nails above the saw blade plugs a cable into a battery then activates the toy language teaching device
they succeeded in completing their objective to reach the landing site
their new objective is to communicate with e
s fellow aliens in order to accomplish e
s primary objective which is to return home
mary still dressed in her leopard outfit leaves the house
she is very upset that her children have not yet returned home
she mumbles to herself sticks the wand in her mouth and shakes the car keys
she gets into the car and mumbles that their father is going to hear about this one
she drives down the driveway and into the street to search for her children
this creates more empathy for mary who is very upset that her small children are out this late
the parents in the audience can easily identify with her
but the real function of this scene is to get her out of the house so that the antagonist can invade their home
she could have stayed inside we never see her in the car searching for the children and the next time we do see her is by the refrigerator in the
men get out of a parked car as mary drives away
they take suitcases out of a second car then walk up the driveway to elliotts house
elliott watches the treetops sway
he scratches his face as does e
together they stare at the stars
the wind causes the branch to sway which then pulls the rope which in turn pulls a fork across the saw blade
this drags the nails in the hanger across the flat surface of the blade and sends signals out into space
elliott is overjoyed and shouts that it works while e
repeats the word home
together they gaze up to the stars
they have accomplished their objective of sending a message into space
now they wait to receive a signal back
the light from a flashlight crosses in front of a pumpkins face
more light floods through the slits of gerties door
a hand holding a flashlight opens gerties door and shines the light into the face of a black doll
this has an irritating and frightening effect on anyone in the audience who has ever had the experience of having a light shined into their face
light from the flashlight searches around gerties room
a pile of yellow electrical cord is stacked on the floor near a chair
it slowly unwinds as it is pulled by someone in elliotts room
the door to elliotts room is shut with a poster sign hanging on it saying do not enter
the silhouette of a man passes behind the door as sounds of a geiger counter filter into the air
muffled voices are heard as the cord is pulled to its fullest extent
it forces a chair to slam against the wall
this last action has a jarring effect on the audience
emotionally the audience is outraged at the invasion of the childrens rooms and this creates hatred for the antagonist and his cohorts
they are still faceless so the audience can project the face of the persons they most hate onto these characters
this personalizes the story for them and gets them more intensely involved on an emotional basis
they also become intellectually involved because the sounds of the geiger counter and the extension of the cord to its maximum length forces them to infer that the antagonist has
s home in the closet
this involves the audience in the story much more than if the filmmaker had shown the antagonist poking around in the closet
we have to go now e
its so late already elliott says as both he and e
sadly gaze into the sky
their objective of receiving a return signal has not been achieved
their sadness at failure creates empathy for them in the audience
elliott coughs from being out in the cold damp air
this is a setup for the later scenes when both elliott and e
are deathly ill
elliott repeats that they really have to go home but e
ignores him and has a sad expression on his face as he stares up to the sky
elliott tells them that he has to give them some time
responds by saying ouch signifying that he feels pain
a small fawn watches them from a distance
the jeopardy in the scene is due to their being so late
mary will be very angry and they face the obstacle of getting e
back into the house without being discovered
the fawn generates feelings of sympathy in the audience which is transferred to e
the audience also empathizes with the sadness they feel at failing to make contact
for now supposedly e
wont be able to go home
you could be happy here
i could take care of you says elliott tearfully
i wouldnt let anybody hurt you
we could grow up together elliott states his primary objective to always have e
home home says e
states his primary objective to go home
elliott sits down and cries
touches one of his tears
the audience empathizes with the sadness of both characters
elliott is asleep as he leans against a large rock
he is covered with a blanket as the wet forest mist surrounds him
next to him lies e
s communication device
elliott coughs gets up tugs on the rope which activates the device then looks around for e
but cant find him
the new objective where is e
and what has happened to him
this is also the new question that will maintain the audiences interest
mary opens the refrigerator door and puts back a carton of milk
mike and gertie sit besides her
a policeman asks mary how elliott was dressed when she last saw him
mary tells him that he was dressed as a hunchback
the policeman whose face is not shown i suppose so that the audience will associate him as one of them asks mary if there is any indication that he might
have run away
were there any family problems or recent arguments
mary explains that she and her husband had just separated and that this has not been easy on the kids
my father is in mexico says gertie
this scene generates empathy for the whole family
mary slams the refrigerator door shut thereby revealing elliott standing behind it
white light floods onto him making him look ghastly
mary hugs him as mike and gertie join them
the audience is relieved and overjoyed with elliotts safe return
oh elliott she says as she hugs him
dont ever do this again elliott
youre so hot
elliott is feverish from spending the night outside
mary tells gertie to go upstairs and draw him a bath
mary walks over to the policeman whose face is still unseen and thanks him for his concern
elliott asks mike if e
is in the house
mike shakes his head indicating no
elliot pleads with mike to find him
hes somewhere in the forest near the bald spot
this is the new objective find e
and bring him back
mike rides the bicycle with the basket in front down the driveway and into the street past a car filled with waiting men
the car starts and follows mike
he looks behind and realizes that he is being pursued
this is a standard chase scene with a friend who is trying to save the life of the protagonist being pursued
both he and the protagonist are in jeopardy
mikes new sub objective is to lose those who are following him
mike cuts through a backyard and into an alley behind some houses
the car follows him
mike then rides up an embankment and drives off in the opposite direction leaving the car stranded behind
he successfully accomplished his subobjective
mike rides through the forest as he calls out e
he stops and searches for e
mike finds the abandoned communication device then runs up a path and discovers e
s white sheet hanging from the open gate
the blue orange colors of e
s communication device are the same colors that spielberg chose the logo of his production company amblin this is the same gate near the landing site that the characters ran
past in the opening sequence
in another part of the forest mike rides his bike on a ridge above a stream
t lies in the water below is skin discolored to that of sickly white
mike sees him grabs the sheet then runs down the embankment
a raccoon wanders near e
mike shouts him away then covers e
mike hears the sounds of a helicopter above him and looks up at the sky
mike has achieved his objective he has found e
but danger hovers above him in the unseen presence of the ever observing antagonist
the shadow of a man falls on the driveway
the sound of keys jangling is heard
high jeopardy the antagonist is about to invade the home of the protagonist
mike is in the hallway as mary walks up the stairs
she has a cup of coffee in her hand
the cup is a prop which will be used to reveal marys emotions
he wants her to come with him
he asks her if she remembers the goblin
he tries to get her to make a promise but she is annoyed with him
michael then opens the door to the bathroom
elliott is sitting on the floor as gertie sits on the counter
they are both looking into the bathtub
mary smiles as she walks into the bathroom with the cup of coffee in her hand
then she sees e
on the floor
he is a sickly white
he extends his arms out towards her
mary is stunned as she turns the cup over and coffee pours out onto the floor
here a characters non verbal action with a prop reveals her true emotional state
she has lost it
i think were dying says elliott
mary covers her mouth
mike tries to tell her that e
wont harm them but she orders him to take gertie downstairs
gertie cries that hes the man from the moon as mike picks her up and carries her downstairs
elliott clothed only in white long john underwear is visually almost identical to the ghastly white colored e
mary picks up elliott and carries him out of the room as e
groans and reaches out for them
marys objective is to save her family from the alien in her home
mary carries elliott down the stairs
he protests that she cant leave e
michael runs down the stairs with gertie on his back
he opens the door freezes then backs away
mary with elliott in her arms approaches the door and is confronted by a man in a spacesuit
mary backs into the living room as the spaceman enters and reaches out for her
she goes in the opposite direction only to run into another man in a spacesuit
she runs into the kitchen followed by mike carrying gertie
the are blocked by still another spaceman with outstretched arms
mary and her children are backed into a corner
another man in a spacesuit opens up the window blinds from the outside
mary shouts this is my home
the sun rises as a line of men wearing helmets and uniforms march up the street
his skin discolored to a grey white hue lies on the floor as a man in a space suit enters the room
home says e
this is the end of act two
the antagonist and his forces have invaded the home of the protagonist and taken them into possession
this terrifying invasion of the privacy of their home generates more empathy for mary and her children
men in helmets walk up a street as they push a large plastic tunnel
police cars slowly drive up the street as faceless men march to a drumbeat
this is the beginning of the third act with the forces of the antagonist in complete control
men with welding torches work on a truck
the plastic tunnel leads up the driveway to elliotts house
the faces of the men are still not shown
they are either wearing helmets or are silhouettes
the man with keys jangling on his side is putting on a pair of light blue pants
men are working outside
large bright lights flood the area
the man in the blue suit puts on a white pair of plastic gloves
red and black colors on his cuff are associated with his keys as ominous music fills the soundtrack
this is the only instance in this film where the traditional colors of the antagonist red and black are associated with the antagonist keys
putting on a light blue outfit starts the transformation of the antagonist into a character worthy of audience empathy for blue white is the traditional production design colors signifying innocence
the man in the light blue suit gets up walks through the plastic tunnel towards elliotts house
he exits the tunnel and walks into the house which has been completely enclosed by plastic
finally the antagonists face is shown
his head is covered by a blue hood while a light under his face mask accentuates his white shirt
mary stands in the middle of the room with gertie at her side
a doctor asks her questions about e
but mary is more concerned with elliotts state
a nurse cuts a lock from gerties hair presumably for analysis while both elliott and e
can be seen on a video monitor
this nurse walks to mike and cuts a piece of his hair while a doctor asks him questions about e
a video monitor shows elliott and e
elliott thinks his thoughts asks the doctor
no elliott feels his feelings answers michael
this is the first time in the film that the merging of elliott and e
has been explicitly stated
yet this condition has been revealed to the audience non verbally throughout the story
the verbalization seems redundant and not necessary but does make sense as an explanatory comment to a character new to the story
a man stands in what appears to be a decontamination chamber
hands push buttons on electronic equipment used to gather medical information about elliott and e
graphs representing e
and elliott run in exact parallel
this is another representation of the fact that e
and elliott have merged and are to be considered as one being
two people in white suits zip open a plastic covering and enter the room where elliot and e
are being examined
the color white traditionally signifying purity
a transition in the audiences emotional alliances is being manipulated at this stage of the story
their hatred will be transferred from keys who will become much more sympathetic to death itself which threatens the life of e
it would be too much to ask of the adult audience to remain sympathetic to the emotional pleadings of a child when space scientists are trying to save the life
of a sick alien
youre scaring him cries elliott as the doctors examine both elliott and e
as they lie on adjacent tables
ts head rests on a blue piece of cloth
leave him alone leave him alone
i can take care of him moans elliott
which of course he cant
but this is something that both he and probably most of the children in the audience really believe
elliott looks up into the face of keys who says that hes been to the forest
he wants to know what the machine does
elliott says that its a communication machine and asks if its still working
he then states that he came to me
he came to me
keys explains that hes been wishing for this too ever since he was ten years old
he doesnt want the alien to die
he asks what more can they do that they are not already doing
elliotts image reflects in keys face gear
elliott tells him that e
was calling his people because he needs to go home
keys is no longer the threat
he has been transformed into a friend who also wants to help the alien
a new antagonist must now be created in order to maintain conflict in the story
in this scene death will serve that function
for the rest of the film the forces of the united states government who attempt to block e
s escape will function as the antagonist
another doctor dressed in white enters the room and announces that e
suddenly a display screen shows a drop in e
and elliotts graphs
one doctor says theres a drop in the creatures blood temperature while another states that elliotts condition is stabilizing his blood pressure is coming back up
calls elliotts name and the medical personnel become aware that he can talk
elliott pleads with him to stay
repeats the words stay stay then slowly turns his head away
their graphs separate
one doctor announces that the boy is coming back but they are losing e
michael enters the closet space where e
he looks at the objects including the cartoon page from the newspaper then huddles down among e
these actions create more empathy for michael who suffers at the thought of losing e
the is a time transition for michael is asleep in e
s space when the morning sun shines on his face
michael wakes up then watches the plant which represents e
s life force wilt
dont go screams elliott
doctors state that he has no blood pressure and there is no pulse or respiration
a bell rings which signifies a life and death situation
doctors run into the room and tear down the plastic coverings surrounding leave him alone
youre killing him says elliott
they wheel elliott out of the room as he continues to scream
the medical staff frantically tries to revive e
they try electrical shocks but that fails
gertie holds her doll as she watches
she reacts by jumping when the electrical shocks are applied to e
showing one characters reactions to a situation help to create the intended reaction in the audience
the doctors are losing him
elliott watches and cries
mary goes to him and they hug each other
gertie cries as she holds her doll
mike walks into the room as keys watches then turns away
this provides the audience with each characters reaction to the death of e
this is a surprising event for the audience the protagonist has died
emotionally it was designed to sadden the audience so that they will become overjoyed when he is brought back to life
a white van awaits at the bottom of the driveway
previously the vans and cars associated with the antagonist were of dark colors
the color changes allows the filmmaker to use culturally determined color associations to manipulate the audiences emotional responses
police and other officials walk past a white van white truck police cars and other white vehicles towards a tan colored car
mikes friends sit on their bikes behind police barriers
they make comments that something has just happened inside the house
this establishes the existence of mikes friends who will play a crucial role in the last chase scene
the medical staff gives up on e
and decide to pack him in ice
mike watches as the staff of e
slowly walks away
keys removes his headgear and walks to elliott who is standing vigil over e
keys then approaches e
mike watches and cries as a man behind him removes his headgear
the faces of several medical attendants are shown
this humanizes the forces of the antagonist and makes them much less threatening
thats why they had to be faceless for so long throughout the story
keys kneels besides e
and with gloved hand closes his eyes
mary holds gertie
when gerite asks if hes dead mary replies that she thinks so
gertie then says she wishes him back
the interchange between gertie and mary reminds the audience of the tinker bell situation when mary read to her from peter pan
those same feelings are reintroduced here the clapping of hands to save the fairy and then the desire to rescue the children
this is the payoff to the emotional reactions set up in that earlier scene
keys looks up to see two attendants roll in a metal casing filled with ice into which they will place e
mary picks up gertie and carries her out of the room
medical technicians prepare the casing as elliott watches
keys approaches elliot and tells him that they will be taking e
they are just going to cut him all up replies elliott
this is the payoff to the frog sequence
the audience believes that elliott is correct given the scientific mind as demonstrated by the teacher
they also now remember the joy they felt when elliott freed the frogs and wish they could experience that again now
do you want to spend some time alone with him
asks keys as he puts his arm around elliott and walks him to the casing
he tells the medical attendants to leave the room
this generates empathy for keys who is shown to be concerned for elliotts feelings
the attendants walk out of the room past michael who is watching elliott
keys leaves elliott alone with the body of e
which is covered in a plastic bag as it lies on dry ice
elliott stares down at e
look at what theyve done to you
im so sorry
you must be dead
i didnt know how to feel
i cant feel anything anymore
youve gone someplace else now
i love you
elliott wears a partially open white jacket
he is framed within an oval shaped glass
elliott places the cover down over e
and walks away from the oval glass
a red light flashes from inside the casing but elliott doesnt notice this as he walks away
he passes the pot of wilted flowers
the flowers slowly start to regain strength
elliott notices this then quickly returns the casing
this is the payoff for the pot of wilted flowers prop
he opens the casing sees the red light flashing from e
s heart then zips open the plastic bag
the alien looks up and says e
elliott screams with joy
home home home home says e
does this mean they are coming
yes answers e
has finally succeeded in his objective of communicating home
elliott tells him to stay and shut up as he places his hand over e
elliott zips him back up then places a cloth over his flashing red heart as keys re enters the room
elliott slams down the cover
keys pulls elliott away from the case as two attendants prepare for its removal
elliott cries out with feigned sorrow to conceal his glee when he sees the wilted flowers regain their health
the attendants lock the case
elliott tells mike that e
mikes also overjoyed
mike and elliott rejoice as the wilted flowers continue to bloom
mary is talking to keys as gertie runs up with the pot of flowers in her hands
he asks mary if the boys have gone because shes sup posed to give her a note when they have gone
mary takes the note from gertie and reads it
this note provides the crisis to which mary must react yet the audience is kept in suspense
elliott runs down the tunnel past two men dressed in blue then enters the back of the van
elliott then pulls aside the white curtains that separate the drivers compartment from the back of the van to reveal michael in the drivers seat
he to is wearing a blue jacket
elliott yells at mike for not wearing his mask
suddenly a black official walks by the van spots mike in the drivers seat and knocks on the window
he holds a walkie talkie in his hand as he asks mike who he is
mike responds that hes driving
the official tells mike to open the door
when mike looks to elliott for advice elliott tells him to drive away
elliott and mikes objective is to escape with e
a group of men approach the van
mike screams that hes never driven forward before shifts into first gear and drives away
this is the payoff to the scene of mike incompetently backing the car down the driveway
as mike drives away he drags along the plastic tunnel with the two men still inside
mike briefly stops by his friends and tells them to meet him at the playground at the top of he hill
he then drives away pursued by a group of men
mikes friends put on their hats and sun glasses and join the fray
the chase is on
suspense is created because the audience wonders whether they will get e
back to the forest before the are stopped
they face impossible odds yet mikes friends display loyalty as they join the fight
mike and elliotts first objective is to reach the park
their major obstacle is the men trying to capture them
mike drives the van down the street
the two men still in the plastic tunnel try to climb back towards the van
elliott starts to disconnect the tunnel by pulling out metal braces
jeopardy if these men get into the van they will overpower elliott and mike and prevent e
from getting home
mary backs her car out of the garage
gertie is sitting next to her in the front seat holding onto the flower pot
keys runs up to mary and asks where shes going
gertie blunts out to the spaceship
keys now realizes that the aliens are returning for e
this is his crisis information that spurns him into action
the van continues down the road still pulling the plastic tunnel behind it
the two men have almost made it to the back of the van as elliott pulls out the final stake
he tosses it to one of the men
when mike turns a sharp corner the plastic tunnel disconnects leaving the two men behind
they have overcome their immediate obstacle
humor is generated when elliott tosses the nail to one of the men because it is the reversal of a life saving situation
instead of catching something like a rope that will save him he catches the object that is his undoing
a convoy of police cars drive up a street
the chase is still on
even though one obstacle has been overcome the antagonist brings more formidable forces into the fight
the protagonist is still in jeopardy
the white van drives up over the sidewalk and into the park
it swerves between the childrens rides then finally stops
smoke pours out of the van whose back two doors are still open
they have reached their sub objective the park where they are to meet up with mikes friends and continue on their bikes
mikes friends wait on their bikes
between them they also have bikes for elliott and mike
is revealed to the boys
he stands among the smoke from the dry ice with his red heart light flashing
okay hes a man from outer space and were taking him to his spaceship says elliott now dressed in blue pants white shirt and red jacket
why cant he just beam up
this is reality greg says elliott
of course the joke is that it isnt reality
it is a fantasy movie with a realistic response to a fantastic situation
elliott finally wins the respect and admiration of mikes friends something hes desired from his introduction scene when they wouldnt allow him to play dungeons dragons with them
mary along with a crowd of plain clothes police run towards the van
dont shoot theyre only children screams mary
this introduces a life and death jeopardy into the scene
it also characterizes the forces of the antagonist as characters who would shoot children
they reach the back of the van only to find it empty
elliott and friends ride down the street
covered with a white blanket rides in elliotts basket
elliott with the red hood over his head shouts that they are to ride to the forest
to cloth a character in red is effective in chase scenes
this helps the audience to visually pick out the scenes important character when the pace is fast and the action intense
spielberg used this technique for elliot in this scene and for marion in raiders of the lost ark when she runs through the market chased by arabs
cars chase them
elliott rides up the alley and tells the others to follow him
police cars encircle them and try to cut them off
the bikers turn off the main road and ride into a dirt field
a tan car with united states government written on the drivers door rides parallel to the bikers
two men ride inside the tan car
one speaks into the car radio saying that theyll get them at the bottom of the hill
the tan car pulls into the base of the hill and stops
one man gets out and starts to climb up the embankment
the bikers almost run him over
they ride over the hood of the car then continue down the street now pursued by a blue police car
the bikers cycle down a dirt road of a section of the community that is still under development
with the white blanket covering his head sits in the basket of elliotts bike
a blue car trails them
the bikers decide to split up
two ride down an embankment
they are followed by another police car
the bikers then escape from their pursuers by riding down steep embankments
the cars cannot follow and must stop on different levels
the bikers unite and ride away
it seems that the chase is over and they have eluded the antagonist
the bikers are overjoyed by their victory
one takes off his hat waves it in the air and shouts weve made it
suddenly he quickly ducks to avoid being grabbed by a man
a group of men continue the chase
several cars pull up ahead and form a blockade in the road
elliott and e
horror grows on elliotts face as he stares at the enemy in front of him
this final confrontation between the protagonist elliott and e
and the antagonist
the antagonist is explicitly revealed at this moment
on the side panel of a car is a sign stating the shadow of a shotgun covers the sign
next two shotguns are raised against e
elliott shuts his eyes with fear
there is a closeup of e
with shotguns drawn government agents gesture for them to stop
this is the life and death final moment before the climax
the audience has been set up to expect that the government agents would shoot at the protagonist by marys comments in the park scene
saves the day with his telekinetic powers
he lifts all of the bikers up into the air as they fly above the blockade
the climax is over e
has saved himself and his friends e
then flies the bikers over the housetops and across the setting sun
finally they float down onto a path in the forest
elliott has reached the landing site
he brushes the leaves away from the turntable of the communication device
a blue light floods elliotts face
he looks up into the along with the other bikers
with red heart happily flashing also gazes into the sky as his spaceship descends
home says e
the spaceship continues its descent as e
s red heart flutters
the spaceship finally lands in a golden glowing light
a car pulls into the forest and gerties voice can be heard pointing out the location of the boys
the ramp to the spaceship lowers
gertie runs up to mike and e
she gives e
the plant and says that she just wanted to say goodbye
michael responds that e
doesnt know goodbye
be good says e
yes says gertie as she kisses him on the nose
mike places his hand on e
this is a basic gesture of trust
the fact that e
allows mike to do this indicates that he considers him a friend
puts the plant on the ground as mary and keys run up to the edge of the site
mike picks up gertie and carries her away as elliott approaches come says e
t stay says elliott
the two characters that had merged into one protagonist must split apart because they now have different primary objectives
wants to return home and elliott wants him to remain
lifts his finger to his lips and says ouch
of course this indicates the pain he feels in their separation
elliott tearfully lifts his finger to his lips and says ouch
the symmetry of his movements indicate that in some sense they still are one
and elliott hug each other as the are visually surrounded by blue and white lights
then elliott and mary exchange glances as mike and gertie stand by and watch
lifts his finger to elliotts forehead
it lights up then he says ill be right here
the resolution of the dilemma
leaves he will still remain perhaps telepathically or perhaps only within elliotts thoughts
bye says elliott
picks up the potted plant and carries it up the gangplank
elliott watches from below as harvey starts up the plank then returns to elliotts side
leaves with what he really came for a sample of the earths vegetative life form
but now he has much more in the flowers that will serve as a memorial of all that he has experienced with his new friends
the gangplank lifts up and separates e
the ships circular entrance closes
the spaceship lifts off
elliott watches it float up into the sky
it then speeds away leaving an orange blue rainbow behind against the blue morning sky
orange and blue were also the colors of e
s makeshift communication device as found by mike in the forest
mary watches and laughs with happiness
the other boys also watch as mike holds gertie in his arms
the film ends with a shot of elliott gazing up into the sky
