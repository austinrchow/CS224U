written by terry mckeown charles gilliam may th a row of rundown terrace houses
some are boarded up
not all the street lights work
those that do cast shadows of parked vehicles glistening in the rain
a front door opens and don appears with rubbish which he puts in a bin
he hears something and looks up to see four big horses pulling a hulking great wagon down the middle of the street
the wagon is a gigantic windowless box
the horses are harnessed and there are reins but no sign of a driver
its a very weird sight
don unable to take his eyes off this amazing apparition shouts back into the house from where light from a tv flickers
what is it
irritated im trying to watch this
its the last episode
annoyed come here
carol appears in the doorway
what is it
but the wagon and horses have gone
carol disgusted swats him on the head with the flat of her hand and goes back inside
a young couple are snogging in the back of a parked car
music is playing on the radio
they are interrupted by heavy vibrations and the terrifying sight of the huge looming horse drawn box as it trundles past
the clock shows and strikes am
the wagon has stopped
the back begins to open top bottom and sides like a dark menacing flower unfolding its petals
shadowy figures manoeuvre the side panels and begin to raise the roof
while this is happening the camera tracks around to reveal a garishly lit club across the street
a group of drunken youths emerge from the club staggering laughing shouting drinking breaking bottles and throwing up
the lads grope the girls
everyones having a great time
they see the wagon and stop unsteadily in their tracks
we now see what they see
the wagon has been converted into a stage
were looking at an old fashioned and very shabby travelling theatre
electric footlights are powered by a clanking generator
the pediment above the stage carries the words the astonishing imaginarium of doctor parnassus
percy a dwarf dressed as a medieval demon and rigged out as a one man band plays a fanfare introducing a young man anton years old who emerges from the
back of the stage dressed as mercury the messenger of the gods with wings on his helmet and sandals
ladies and gentlemen
i mercury the messenger of the gods invite you
tonight for one night only
at this very venue
to enter the mind the very great mind of doctor parnassus
percy does a roll on the drum as a curtain behind anton mercury rises to reveal doctor parnassus he appears to be an indian holy man long scraggly beard chalk
white make up a large red circle on his bald head a crown of yellow flowers strings of beads and partially covered in a loose fitting swath of white cloth apparently levitating several feet above the stage
hes sitting on a glass plinth
doctor parnassus is seemingly in a trance
a bronze tripod containing burning incense stands beside him
as old as time
yes ladies and gentlemen more than a thousand years old
he has the power to empower your mind
a secret learned in the mystic east
let doctor parnassus open your imagination
let him guide and transport you to worlds and possibilities you never dreamt of
if you dare
there are dangers
you will have to choose
will your soul fly
or will it be dashed on the rocks of darkness
the choice is yours and yours alone
transcend the heights on beautys wing
a young woman valentina wearing a wig of long blonde hair and a white flowing costume which gives her prominent hips and breasts stands facing an elaborately framed full length
mirror nestled upstage amongst cut out trees representing a forest
this is beauty
she turns and steps forward
anton takes her hand
they make a couple of dance steps together
they look enchanting and enchanted
to the audience or if you must
now percy in demon costume leaps from behind the scenery
scour the squalid depths with putrids brother stench
percy indicates a ticket dispenser attached to the front of the stage
take a ticket and join the queue
only five quid a go
theres no greater bargain on planet earth
a beer bottle lands on the stage the drunken youths cheer
fulfilment grace and light or
waste filth and darkness
under his breath watching the drunk martin with contempt no prizes for guessing what youll do
martin has begun with difficulty to clamber onto the stage
his mates laugh and shout encouragement
not in character
he stutters no
thats n not allowed
you have to t take a t ticket first
anton tries to prevent martin from getting on stage
but martin thumps anton and pulls him into the audience
martins drunken mates laugh and applaud
martin is now on stage and heading for doctor parnassus who is still in a trance
percy tries to head him off but martin shoves percy off the stage
percy lands on the ground with a crash
more laughter from the mob
drunkenly to parnassus hey you
i wanna audition
i wanna be a star
martin is on the verge of tweaking doctor parnassus nose or pulling his beard when valentina diverts him
get off the stage
martin turns his bleary focus to valentina
thas a nice pair of jugs
martins mates roar their approval
get off the stage
i wan you
i wan you
martin lunges at beauty who retreats up stage
martin blunders into the scenery as he pursues beauty who stays just out of reach
she takes cover behind a cut out tree
anton and percy climb back onto the stage as martin continues to chase beauty
valentina evades him by ducking through the mirror made of flexible reflective material slit down the middle
martin crashes after her
anton and percy exchange worried looks
they look at doctor parnassus
should they wake him from his trance
they decide not to but its a difficult decision
the stage set which was clearly only a few feet deep now seems much deeper and to contain many more cut out trees
beauty weaves in and out of the dimensional trees as martin chases her further into the increasingly magical forest
beautys costume has been transformed into something wonderful
a rainbow studded with diamonds
valentina comes into view
martin is in hot pursuit
come here you little sexpot
valentina stops turns smiles sweetly and slams her fist hard into martins gut
he doubles up
valentina pauses for a moment contemplating doing some serious damage before striding off
martin staggers to his feet
he rushes after her but trips on a root a real dimensional tree root and pitches face first to the ground
recovering he looks up
he is surrounded by a dark terrible and very real forest
beauty has vanished
valentina beauty slips back on stage through the mirror
her costume has reverted to its original state
she examines her knuckles on the hand with which she punched martin
anton looks at her
parnassus is still in a trance his lips moving soundlessly
anton watches doctor parnassus in awe
shes had enough
martin is lost and terrified in the dark forest
his voice echoes through the giant trees
but his cries are interrupted by another sound
a tarzan like howl
martin spins around
strange creatures are swinging on vines through the giant trees
they are all around him
they look like hands
with little heads and arms where the wrists should be
they are all howling and jabbering
from behind a hand creature swings down and grabs martin by the collar hoisting him high into the air
clearing the trees martin sees he is not alone
there are many other people all in the clutches of hand creatures swinging on vines
but the vines are actually long slim tentacles
dangling from enormous luridly coloured jellyfish that float through the dark frightening sky
from some of the tentacles bottles of booze dangle just out of reach of the struggling crowd all desperate for a drink
from now on
not a drop
with a smile of satisfaction the hand creature stops jabbering and lets go of martins collar
down he plummets
the ground rushes up
matrtin is as good as dead
but when he hits the ground rather than going splat
he bounces high in the air turns a couple somersaults and lands on his feet
he cant believe what has just happened
and then he hears music
beautiful ethereal music
in the distance a light is glowing
its the sun rising above a majestic mountain pass
cut into the rock is a long stairway winding up to the summit
the hand creature swings down gives martin the thumbs up and points encouragingly toward the stairway
reformed and determined martin heads for the stairs
but on reaching them he discovers that each one is feet high
the stairway is ridiculously steep and difficult
letters are carved into the first stair
the x step program
this is going to be tough
the sound of a honky tonk piano makes him turn
behind him the sky is dark
a roadside bar nightclub with flashing neon lights has appeared
he could use a drink before the long climb
he heads for the club
the door to the club is opened by a mechanical fairground figure of a jolly smiling man mr nick distinguished by a bowler hat and a red waistcoat
looks like you could use a drink
martin relieved and reassured by the welcome steps inside
the door closes followed by the sound from within of much gaiety and laughter
the camera pulls back as the nightclub suddenly explodes in a the sound of police sirens
we are back outside in front of the theatre
parnassus rises unsteadily coming out of his arduous trance
beauty moves to support him as exhausted he loses his balance and snaps out of his trance
holding his head valentina
indignant he was chasing me
angry you dont go through the mirror
i had to get away
you hit him
youre out of control
ever since your mother died
when i was three
i dont want to talk about it
indignant you brought it up
doctor parnassus turns on anton
we dont accept drunks
we c couldnt stop him
people must be in their right minds when they make the choice
im s sorry
the police are dealing with a drunken mob of nightclub revellers making arrests
a distraught hysterical drunken girl is looking for martin
she sees beauty
he went with that cow
ill scratch her eyes out
a policewoman grabs the drunken girl and drags her struggling into police van
martins friends are searching for him around the stage
marty where are you
a policeman grabs him oi
theyve got our mate back there
to parnassus you
what do you think youre playing at
we dont play
what we do is deadly serious
parnassus pushes aside the mirror to reveal a door in the back wall of the shallow stage
it is swinging open
will we miss him
i dont think so
the policeman looks and frowns
to the policeman condescendingly dont worry if you dont understand it immediately
percy wisely decides to head off conflict
he steers doctor parnassus away from the policeman
to policeman hes doing his bit to save the human race
he thinks its got a future
i keep telling him to get a proper job
shaking his empty collection cup check it out
another night with nothing in the kitty
i want you freaks out of here
if i ever see you in this parish again ill do you
doctor parnassus bows exaggeratedly with a hint of mockery
the police officer suspects that doctor parnassus is taking the piss but decides not to press it
instead he knees martins struggling friend to the ground
the sky is grey with the first light of dawn
the wagon rolls off down the dark street as a dustcart rumbles into view and its crew begin emptying bins and picking up rubbish
loud aggressive rides
people milling around
the wagon is parked at the edge of the fair
the stage is set
anton dressed as mercury is trying to attract an audience without much success
for one night only
the imaginarium of dr
not to be missed
on stage is doctor parnassus levitating and in a trance as before
incense smoke swirls around him
test your imagination
envisage the sublime
let doctor parnassus be your guide
discover the heights of wisdom
valentina dances forward looking fabulous as wisdom
or if you will visit the doldrums with all thats vile and stinks
percy steps forward once again in his mediaeval demon costume
indicating ticket machine take a ticket and wait your turn
twenty quid a go reduced to five for one night only
the world is full of wonders beauty enchantment for those with eyes to see
he magically produces a bouquet of flowers
throws it into the air
it transforms into beautiful doves
this impressive trick is totally ignored by a group loudly arguing just in front of the stage the family from hell
i want to go on the wall of death
stop going on linda
youre not old enough
they wont let you darling
but i want to
i want to
parnassus stirs from his trance
hes had enough of this
would you mind
its not fair
its the fair but its not fair
uncle bob laughs uproariously
linda pushes him into aunty ow
diego aged and absorbed in his portable video game wanders away from the family
leave her alone
this is the imaginarium
it requires respect concentration
kindly go elsewhere and take your detritus with you
is he insulting us
to the dr
parnassus threateningly oy
parnassus ignores him and resumes his trance
unnoticed by all diego has somehow managed to climb onto the stage and is peering at the mirror
looking around diego
valentina turns her head just in time to see diego vanish through the mirror
she starts to go after him then hesitates
trying to get antons attention pssst
anton looks across the stage to her
she mimes that a certain someone has gone into the mirror
anton considers waking doctor parnassus but thinks better of it
instead he heads off upstage and through the mirror in pursuit of diego
valentina takes over the pitch
ladies and gentlemen let dr
parnassus be your guide
anton moves through the cut out trees and into a fantastic brightly coloured landscape of dr
seuss like hills and valleys
the sky if full of cloud sized soap bubbles
diego is in the distant using his game controller to make the bubbles bang into each other
trying to burst them
we can hear valentina trying to continue the pitch in the face of the family from hell
their baby has now started wailing
cracks in the ground begin to appear under anton s feet
beauty truth wisdom justice
without imagination all are dead
the landscape in response to dr
parnassus rage suddenly rips apart fragmenting and spinning with anton inside it
enraged things fly in all directions
anton recovering struggles out from between giant blocks of stone
the world has gone dark
he hears diego crying somewhere in the distance and starts to clamber over the shattered monoliths
reaching the top anton sees diego on the peak of a distant rocky pinnacle surrounded by bottomless chasms
there are what appear to be two suspension bridges spanning the void on either side of the pinnacle
cut to diego who is in a state of confusion and terror
is he lost inside a video game he cant control
he presses the buttons on his gaming device to no avail
one of the bridges leads to a bluff where war games are under way
all very video game like
thrilling aggressive music blares forth
mr nick appears still in red waist coat and bowler hat but this time in the form of a cut out shooting target with a bulls eye on his chest
come on laddy cross the bridge
be a man
kill the enemy
impress your dad
as he speaks bullets fly
each time mr
nick gets shot and is knocked flat he pops back up continuing his spiel
the other bridge appears to be made of black and white piano keys and looks very rickety and unsafe
the piano key bridge descends into a great cavern where hundreds of boy and girl pianists are practising on hundreds of pianos all playing the same tune the tune dr
parnassus is humming but with stern demanding piano teachers in attendance
no no start again
from the top
diego doesnt know what to do
behind him rises a strange mongolfier balloon
parnassuss face is repeated again and again around its circumference
antons in the basket
diego catches sight of anton
indicating gaming device it doesnt work
what g g game
the video game
the one were in
i d d dont know what youre t t talking about
miserable i c cant
im n not supposed to be here
what am i going to do
thats the p point
its up to you
dont leave me
dont let me die
but anton has gone
diego terrified tests the bridge to the war games
join the men
nothing to it
hup two hup two
the music from the pianos seems to have an effect on him
he comes to a decision
he drops his gaming device then very hesitantly steps onto the extremely wobbly piano keys
the cut out shooting target mr nick isnt happy
thats the wrong choice
that bridge leads to failure and despair
youll be dead before youre thirty
this is the one
this is the bridge to manhood
diego looks uncertain unnerved
for a moment we think he might change his mind but he presses bravely on across the piano bridge
at last finally theres a bit of a crowd around the theatre but drawn only by the family from hell who are making a lot of noise
hysterical hes been kidnapped
theyve taken him
its that weirdo up there
do something dad do something
i want my brother
i want my little brother
on stage dr
parnassus continues to hum in his trance like state
inspector of fairs rattles on
you cannot perform here without appropriate authorization
getting no response from dr
parnassus he pulls out his mobile phone and dials
with phone to ear its me
i need some support
weve got trouble
anton steps out of the mirror
he produces an inflated balloon which he releases and which then flies zig zagging out over the audience
parnassus wakes in time to see the balloon
delighted with antons message ha ha
one little devil out of the fire
makes it all worthwhile
he magically produces a tarot card from the startled inspectors ear
where did you say youre from
he lifts his arm with a flourish whereupon a gloriously painted canvas sky unrolls from the top of the set disgorging diego as it reaches the stage
diego rolls out tumbles across the stage and lands next to the rest of his family
hes beaming laughing full of wonder transformed by his experience
where have you been
ive been worried sick
descending from his glass plinth and so
a glimmer of hope
perhaps eternity has not been in vain
dad smacks diego round the back of the head
and you can wipe that silly expression off your face you little poof
gleefully youre in big trouble
youre in big trouble
youve upset your mum
hes spoilt our evening
and wheres your gamer
hes lost his bloody gamer
another fifty quid down the drain
youre not getting another one
why do we bother
the family from hell moves off
diego full of wonder and oblivious to his family looks back at parnassus and gives the old man the thumbs up
parnassus smiles and raises his thumb in response
the inspector of fairs is joined by a policeman and whats the trouble
ah the fuzz
what did you say
charmingly fuzzy wuzzy was a bear fuzzy wuzzy had no hair fuzzy wuzzy wasnt fuzzy wuzzy
the police and the inspector exchange dark looks
clearly theyre dealing with a dangerous trouble maker
to parnassus next time i find you doing business without a permit ill impound your wagon
to parnassus ill be doing worse than that
now bugger off
he bows mock graciously
valentina half undressed is struggling out of her wisdom costume while at the same time looking at pictures of beautiful homes and gardens in a very battered copy of homes
without make up and costume she appears much younger
a movement of something reflected in the dressing room mirror catches her eye
in the mirror we see mr nick not a cut out but the real thing
startled guiltily hiding homes and gardens oh
she turns holding her dress to cover her modesty
theres nobody there
anton and percy are packing up and closing the wagon
parnassus out of his make up and costume is smiling and humming to himself as he removes the feed bag from one of the horses
the horse lifts its head and dr parnassus recoils in shock and horror
standing directly behind the horse is mr
a huge grin splitting his face
its been a while hasnt it
percy winding a rope onto a cleat hears distant laughter and looks up
cut to percys p
where we see some distance away and in a relatively secluded spot mr nick rocking with laughter while doctor parnassus looks stricken
he clutches at the back of a park bench to steady himself
cut to percy who looks thoughtful and worried
he heads off to help doctor parnassus as the latter slumps onto the bench
mr nick has vanished
distraught hes come to collect
i thought so
what can i do
there must be something
he looks over to where valentina is helping close the theatre
percy follows his gaze
youre going to have to tell her
the wagon makes its way through city streets
percy is sitting on the roof driving
anton is lying on the roof looking up at the stars
valentina is sitting next to him lost in thought
look at that moon
no response from valentina ive n never seen it so b big
and the stars
its so c clear
percy holds his hand out palm up
sotto voce valentina
i c c cant call you val p parnassus d doesnt like it
hes not here is he
hes inside getting pissed
are you happy
anton produces an old beaten up copy of beautiful homes and starts thumbing through it
she tries to snatch it from him
he flutters it out of her reach
give it me
she wrests it from him and hides it just as percy looks back at them
sotto voce would you really be happy in one of those p places
n not me
suddenly urgent lets run away
make a new life together
stocks and bonds
we could be happy
just the two of us
sotto voce anton
why d do you always have to p pretend to be so b brutal
im not pretending
im under age
knowingly teasing i shall be twelve on wednesday
dont be ridiculous
how old will i be on wednesday
parnassus says so too
are you saying hes ridiculous
teasing yes you are
ill tell him
he knows i worship him
he takes advantage
i dont mind
parnassus is a pain
okay hes extraordinary but im not
i dont want to be like him
i want to be like other people
gesturing to the passing city you know
youre so lucky
anton isnt sure how to take this
half apologetically you know what i mean
she gets up kisses anton on the top of his head and climbs down into the hatch
anton looks thoughtful bruised
percy glances back
popping her head back up actually im going to be sixteen
shall i tell parnassus i know
i think he knows i know
she disappears down the hatch then quickly pops back up
mischievously the age of consent
doctor parnassus cabin is tiny
its packed with books and memorabilia egyptian assyrian greek etc
magic trick paraphernalia and much else
a hanging lantern suspended from the ceiling throws moving shadows
parnassus is slumped despondently on a cramped bed
a plate of untouched food sits on a table in front of him
he has laid out tarot cards
to the right the magus
to the left the devil
the next card is the maiden
he places it carefully beneath the magus
he picks up an open bottle of spirits and takes a swig
clearly hes already had a few drinks
cross with him you havent eaten anything
she comes in
i go to all this trouble and you leave it
im not hungry
are you ill
my miraculous child
i have something to tell you
she starts tidying up
avoiding the question i should never have brought you into this rotten bloody world
shes heard this before oh for gods sake
what was i thinking of
percy liked the soup
agitated why does everybody want to live forever
thats normal isnt it
immortalitys a curse
any fool can tell you that
valentina picks up parnassus nearly empty bottle
you know it doesnt agree with you
in difficulty valentina
losing patience and ill be sixteen on thursday so lets not have any more tosh about that
listen to me
you think youre so clever and that everybody else is an idiot
you cant stop me growing up just by lying about my birthday
shut up and listen to me
listen to me
i need to tell you something before its too late
dr parnassus reaches up and plucks a glass paperweight out of the air
its that kind that contains little models which are engulfed in a snow storm when the paperweight is shaken
parnassus shakes the paper weight and watches the snow swirl about
one dark winters night
many years ago
is this going to take long
the camera closes in on and enters the paperweight
many centuries ago as a matter of fact
a hooded rider moves slowly through the snowstorm the horse picking its way carefully across a field of virgin snow
i was visited
by someone i had hoped never to meet
in the distance rising like a dark mountain is a strange monastery
dim light comes from a couple of windows
we can hear from far away the indistinct droning voice of the story teller a younger dr
the camera moves up over and way ahead of the hooded rider continuing through the snowstorm over fields forests valleys rocks until it reaches the monastery high on a rugged
here it enters one of the dimly lit monastery windows taking us into a dining hall
entering via a window and looking down into the monastery dining hall we see dozens of monks sitting at a long refectory table
they are eating their supper and listening to a young dr
parnassus who is sitting on a dais at the far end of the hall his eyes closed in a trance telling a story
a log fire burns in a big fireplace
having captured the wind and tamed the storm
the chief steward laying down to take his rest had a disturbing dream
he dreamt that a hooded rider was approaching across the snow swept plain
a rider who would challenge the very foundations of the world
the door to the refectory swings open with a crash
the monks look up
standing on the thresh hold is the hooded figure covered with snow
he throws off his hood
its mr nick
the steward woke and remembered his dream
what manner of man had he dreamt of and what did it signify
parnassus and mr nick are sitting at the fire
behind them in the hall monks come and go
on the dais a monk continues with the story
this monk is a younger percy
and as the waters rose
the peoples need for stories grew
stories that would feed a great hunger
a hunger for more than just understanding
percy continues telling the story in the background
what exactly do you do here
we tell the eternal story
the story that sustains the universe
the story without which there is nothing
are you telling me that if you stop telling a story
waving in the direction of percy this story
something you made up a fiction
that the universe ceases to exist
you make it sound so simple
and you believe it
its just incredible to me that you can believe something that can be so easily disproved
complacently i dont think so
mr nick turns and throws a spell at percy who goes rigid like a statue struck dumb
the story stops
another monk sitting at the table immediately continues the story
having been brought to the limit of his endurance
mr nick freezes him too stopping him from speaking
a third monk continues
yet the forces of evil could not prevail and
nick renders him silent
mr nick zaps dr
parnassus and all the other monks
none of them can speak
there you are
the storys stopped
no more story
and yet were still here the fires still burning
he pushes open a window
its still snowing
the winds still blowing
parnassus and the monks still struck dumb look appalled
ive freed you from this ridiculous nonsense
mr nick undoes the spell
the monks moan
parnassus slumps down in despair
mr nick smiles and lights a cigarette
hes enjoying this
now you can use your powers to do something else
have fun travel learn a foreign language
a gob of bird shit lands on mr
an eagle circles overhead
it swoops across the hall and exits through a window
parnassus leaps up laughing amazed revived
that bird was a messenger
from distant places we know not of
triumphant other places
the point is youre wrong
and im wrong
it doesnt have to be us here
indicating monks somewhere in the world at any given time
someone is telling a story
sustaining the universe
right now its happening
thats why were still here
you cant stop stories being told somewhere
you cant be everywhere
mr nick is furious
irritated a weak hypothesis
mr nick stubs out his cigarette
i tell you what
youre probably not a betting man but
mr nick whispers into the dr
and so i made a wager with the devil
parnassus and percy are travelling the world with a little theatre
inviting audience members onto the stage to participate
whichever of us won ten converts first would win the bet
my argument was the importance of the story the power of the imagination
his the power of material things the supremacy of stuff
cut to another performance
now the th century
a voice filled with horror was ever lasting life
now the th century
no one wanted our tales any longer
parnassus and percy are performing on a street corner in modern clothes
as are all the passersby who pay them no attention
they look exhausted like beggars
and very old
it seemed as though the devil after all
a beautiful woman played by the same actress as valentina but older with different coloured hair comes into view
from the very first moment i saw her i was head over heels in love
she was beautiful enchanting delightful young
i was several thousand years old
how could i woo her
what could i do
cut to a desolate cliff top where percy is struggling with dr parnassus trying to prevent him from throwing himself off the cliff
dont be a fool
you cant die
youll just end up broken in the eternity ward and ill be stuck looking after you
parnassus breaks free stumbles backwards and pitches out into space
at times like these
the devil is never far away
parnassus is hanging by his coat snagged on a branch angled out from the cliff face and held like a fishing rod by mr nick who has a great grin
on his face
cut to a much younger dr
parnassus and the beautiful woman in a row boat picnicking as they float down a river
they are in love very happy to be together
percy wearing a blazer flannels and straw boater is rowing or punting
the devil granted me mortality again
and youth and great powers
i won my bride
i was in love
but at what price
the boat bumps into a submerged log
parnassus tries to push free
several cigarette butts float past
looking up dr
parnassus sees a man sitting on the riverbank fishing smoking a cigarette
its mr nick
there is a loud and ominous clap of thunder
at what price
parnassus looks haggard
he closes his eyes
he sways and drops the paper weight
at that moment the wagon lurches to a stop and we hear frantic banging on the roof
dr parnassus is glad of the excuse not to go on
what do you mean at what price
turning back to his tarot cards itll wait itll wait
youd better go and see
you insist i listen to a story and then you dont finish it
more banging from above
go and see
valentina turns and goes
parnassus looks miserable but almost relieved
he turns over the next card
its the hanged man
it depicts a body hanging from a gibbet surrounded by several arcane objects
parnassus studies the card trying to wring some meaning from it then lays the hanged man in the space between the others
he takes a swig from the bottle
the wagon has stopped in the middle of blackfriars bridge
its pouring with rain
valentina wearing some sort of covering against the rain climbs out of the hatch and onto the roof of the wagon
here she finds anton pointing excitedly down into the thames
i saw somebody d dancing in the air
under the b bridge
valentina looks doubtfully at percy who peers morosely out from under his sou wester and shakes his head
there was a sh shadow on the water when the lightning flashed
lightning flashes again
we see what anton and valentina see
a shadow on the water of someone dancing hung by his neck with a rope attached to the underside of the bridge
triumphant you see
the d dancer
horrified theres someone hanging there
smugly to percy i t told you
get a rope
anton is absailing over the side of the bridge
one end of a rope is tied around his waist the other is attached to the bridge parapet
a lantern dangles from his waist
valentina and percy watch antons perilous descent
moments later there are two bodies hanging from the bridge the mysterious hanging mans and antons
the man is hanging by a noose around his neck still jerking in his dance of death
his hands are tied behind his back
anton cant reach the man
shouting up i c cant reach him
anton shoots percy and valentina a jaundiced look and with valentinas help on her end of the rope begins to swing back and forth
eventually with a big enough swing he manages to hook his foot around the hanging man who has gone limp
with extreme difficulty and great discomfort anton pulls the man close to him takes a knife from his pocket and cuts the mans rope
anton and the man are now swinging back and forth together on antons rope which is threatening to cut anton in half
youve done it
come on dont hang about
were getting soaked up here
valentina anton and percy manhandle the man over the parapet and onto the pavement
parnassus has just stepped out onto the top of the wagon
hes drunk and is swaying
why are you fishing dead people out of the river
before the police turn up
he goes unsteadily back inside
valentina and anton drag the man under the wagon out of the rain
the man is dressed in an expensive saville row suit
his jacket pockets are full of strange weights and arcane symbols have been scrawled on his forehead
hes about years old and very handsome
the man appears to be dead but valentina decides to try the kiss of life
anton is made uncomfortable seeing valentina administer the kiss of life and he pulls her away
that wont work
and anyway you d dont know where hes b been
he brings both fists down hard on the centre of the mans chest
the dead man coughs sits bolt upright spits out a little metal tube and smashes his head on the underside of the wagon knocking himself out
the little metal tube clatters over the asphalt
well he was
anton picks up the little metal tube and examines it
what on earth is this
valentina anton and percy drag the man from under the wagon and carry him to the rear
put him in the big trunk
the boss said leave him
he thought he was dead
they start to bundle the man in one of the travelling trunks attached to the back of the wagon
with the body hanging half in half out anton suddenly stops
i d dont like it
its none of our b business
so what do you suggest we leave him on the side of the road
anton doesnt want to answer that one
walking away definitely
valentina single handedly hefts the man into the trunk and carefully places a cushion under his head
an action not missed by anton
the wagon stands hidden among deserted derelict buildings
all is quiet
the lid of the big travelling trunk slowly opens
the man struggles out
his neck is sore his wrists ache and his head is bruised
he hasnt a clue where he is
he tries to make sense of the wagon the grazing horses the derelict buildings
some distance away a bizarre horned and tailed creature is involved in a strange contorted dance
hoping to avoid the creature the man starts to move away but is stopped by a squeaky voice behind him
the man turns around to find percy looking at him
i suppose somebody saves your life everyday of the week
he can hardly speak
it hurts him to do so
too much like routine to bother with a thank you
with difficulty who are you
antoine della touraine et sansepolcro da piemonte the third
if that proves too difficult you may call me percy
where are we
geographically in the northern hemisphere
socially on the margins
narratively with some way to go
and your name is
i cant remember
percy whistles to the dancing creature who turns and approaches
the man is getting very nervous
any credit cards
you can have whatever you want
with your name on them
searching his pockets
ive been robbed
dont look at us
whats your name
sceptical he cant remember
suddenly a mobile phone starts ringing
they all look at each other
its in the mans pocket
but he doesnt move
the creature takes his head off
might be for you
theyll know who you are
the man still doesnt move
anton reaches over and tries to find the phone in the mans pockets
the man tries to push him off and find the phone himself
the phone is retrieved but in the struggle to answer it its dropped
a woman speaking russian can be heard from the phone
as anton and the man dive for it the man accidently steps on it
the phone is crushed
i speak russian
anton and percy glare with deep suspicion at the man
i told you to leave him
he was dead
parnassus holding a cold damp towel to his throbbing head appears coughing and miserable from the wagon
well we didnt and he isnt
he was hanging under the b bridge
handing parnassus the noose by his neck
if wed had any sense
anton produces the bricks with strange markings that were in the mans pockets
we found these in his p pockets
doctor parnassus examines the bricks with great interest
he pulls out the hanged man card and compares its arcane details a noose strangely marked shapes like bricks a metal tube to the objects found on the man
the hanged man
is he okay
she appears from inside the wagon
to man are you alright
to parnassus who is in deep thought he tried to kill himself
with his hands t tied behind his b back
they all look at one another
actually i saw that trick performed many years ago at
s somebody was trying to k kill him
we c cant let him stay with us
we d dont know what this is about who he is what he m might have done
croaking i havent done anything
give me the benefit of the doubt
percy and anton exchange knowing looks
appealing to parnassus father
doctor parnassus looking up from his study of the bricks and noose takes the man aside looks closely trying to read the strange markings on his forehead
i recognize them
the man wipes his hand across his forehead
looks at his inky hand
sotto voce youve been sent by mr nick
puzzled mr nick
impassioned dont toy with me
tell me youre an emissary from mr nick
tell me youve come with a proposition
tell me what i want to hear
tony doesnt know what dr parnassus in talking about but he grasps the fact that if he wants to be allowed to stay here he needs to play along
thank god for that
doctor parnassus takes percy aside shows him the hanged man tarot card and indicates the man with a nod
hes from mr nick
no hes not
hes come with a proposal
no he hasnt
all is not lost
looking at the card then to the man youre welcome
croaking thank you
percy groans and tears his hair
valentina is pleased
anton is not
valentina kisses parnassus on the cheek
the man precedes doctor parnassus in the tiny room
he looks around in amazement
we can talk here
sit down sit down
he does so
doctor parnassus sits opposite him
trying to look on top of it i like your study
cautiously the message
whats the message
from mr nick
what does he want
thats the problem
ive lost my memory
itll come back
youve lost your memory
it needs time
incredulous youve come here with a message
a vitally important message from mister nick
a matter of life or death
and you cant remember what it is
not at the moment
its never happened before
the wagon is parked in a shopping mall parking lot
the theatre is being opened up by percy and anton
there are a few late night shoppers coming and going
valentina dressed as beauty is rummaging in a theatre skip helping the man find something to wear for the show
there is a slight whiff of sexual attraction in the air
he says you must work
to focus your mind
you can help out front
ah here we are
pulling out a full bottomed wig try this
you can be justice
the man tries on the wig and looks in a mirror
valentina tries not to laugh
pulling a face exactly
a laughing stock
just like the rest of us
pulling out a carnival mask i think ill hide behind this
the mystery thickens
im going to have to give you a name
she presses a metal breast plate to his chest
until you remember who you are i dub thee saint george
you can save me from the dragon
youve met parnassus
mischievously she ties a chiffon tutu around his waist
now you are making fun of me
im sorry but nobody laughs at me without paying the price
he begins tickling her
she laughs uncontrollably falling backwards into the costume skip
we c cant do it
anton enters wearing his mercury gear
he freezes seeing george and valentina rollicking about
they stop look up
we c cant do it
its your father
alarmed what is it
valentina and anton arrive in the doorway dismayed
george hovers in the background
doctor parnassus is attempting to get ready for the show but hes so drunk he can hardly stand
hes already put some article of clothing on back to front or inside out
percy is trying to help
can he remember
seeing man in doorway can you remember
mr nick sends an emissary and he cant bloody remember
its a bloody disaster
you cant go on
i am not drunk
im under considerable stress
to percy youll have to do it
the audience wont tolerate an understudy
theres only one doctor parnassus and i am he
interrupting somebody make some strong coffee
everyone looks at george
sarcastically saluting george this is why fate has brought us together
dont worry about remembering
its all the same to a man on a galloping horse
doctor parnassus is on stage floating on his glass pillar apparently in a trance but humming erratically
he is flanked by valentina and anton who stay close to parnassus in case he falls
percy is in his medieval costume one man band outfit
they all look uneasy
a bit low key for one night only
raise your sights
encounter the majesty the beauty the miracle thats in each and every one of you
take this opportunity to expand your horizons
its not too late
experience the imaginarium of the great doctor parnassus
valentina peers out over the footlights in the hope of catching sight of george
hes nowhere in sight
sarcastically p probably remembered he had a wife or t two back in russia
valentina gives him a dirty look
george wearing his romantic venice carnival mask is smooth talking several middle aged ladies on queue at the supermarket check out
hes carrying the theatres ticket dispenser
three tickets for the price of two
thats a fantastic deal
its a brilliant show
much better than sex
much ribald laughter from the flattered ladies
the shoppers have gone
the last car drives out of the car park leaving it empty except for the theatre wagon
anton valentina and percy are on their own
parnassus on his plinth is asleep and snoring
thank g god
n not a single customer
lets close up quick while the goings good
amazed hes never not done a show before
maybe hes past it
hopefully maybe its time to retire
parnassus groans in his sleep
looking out front oh n no
anton sees george heading towards them with a mob of middle aged women in tow
bubbling with excitement the mob arrives
the other women agree
looking at her watch when does the next show start
there isnt a next show
evelyn and the other women are puzzled
weve done all the shows were doing here this evening
but weve got tickets
george looks hopefully at valentina and anton who dont know what to say
we hear a crash
the camera pans around
parnassus has fallen off his perch and is now lying on the floor
snoring and mumbling
valentina and some of the women run forward
this mans drunk
suddenly defensive of her father hes not drunk
hes got a bad cold
but being a true professional he tried to keep going at considerable risk to his health
valentina and george exchange a quick look
valentina thinks shes found a kindred spirit
we want our money back
no problem at all
im so terribly sorry
i cant apologize enough
you can have your money back or if you like
an extra free ticket
better yet two extra free tickets if you buy another ticket at half price
this offer is only available today
the women look on the verge of taking up the offer
anton and percy exchange looks
they cant believe georges chutzpah
the wagon rumbles across the deserted carpark
a large pile of coins with quite a few notes mixed in tumble onto a table
george is emptying his pockets while valentina and anton look on
you took all that
i got carried away
lying through your t teeth can do that to you
unperturbed most of them were coming tomorrow
shrugs okay if it makes you feel better ill give it back
sarcastic n no keep it
thanks to you we can afford to buy valentina a b birthday cake
offended thats enough
anton storms off
george looks at valentina sympathetically
dont be angry with him
hes a little bit jealous
ill make it my job to boost his confidence
valentina smiles at george with admiration and approval
whens your birthday
as the wagon trundles out of the deserted car park a dark figure hops onto the rear platform
doctor parnassus is groaning and clutching his head
he has a fierce hangover
he pours some powder from a packet into a glass of water stirs it with his finger and knocks it back
he grimaces and shudders
a hatch shutter on the small window behind him slides open to reveal the grinning head of mr nick
you shouldnt drink it doesnt agree with you
startled doctor parnassus spins around
what do you want
ill do anything
smiles i know
youre mans lost his memory
hes bloody hopeless
hes not my man
little toe rag
he used to run a big charity
i wouldnt trust him
you dont trust me do you
for gods sake
tell me what you want
i just thought
seeing you so upset last night
that you needed a glimmer of hope
maybe a little bet
first to five
you might win
and save her
what do you have to lose
ill kill you
laughs now that would be something
by her birthday then
youve seen the business were doing
things are going to pick up
as sure as eggs is eggs
he closes the hatch shutter with a bang
back amongst the derelict buildings the troupe is resting and doing chores
the horses are grazing
valentina sits at a mirror fussing with various hair styles slyly trying to catch georges attention
parnassus holding his aching head sits a short distance away sadly watching her
percy is with him
two days eh
im trying to think
i told you didnt i
that he was a wrong un
percy nods his head in georges direction
trust in providence percy
remember the hanging man
the cards dont lie
but they sure as hell like being economical with the truth
cut to anton who is painting a long stemmed wooden flower
he comes over to valentina with it in his hand
looking away dont talk to me
im sorry about last night
i behaved like an idiot
anton suddenly plops down on his arse in a puddle of mud
then spins flips the flower high into the air and rolling face down onto his stomach catches the stem with his clenched buttocks
valentina bursts out laughing
you must admit
even idiots have their qualities
cut to george who is peeling potatoes badly
parnassus and percy come up behind him
wed like to know who you really are
i may be able to help
percy produces a small contraption with wires from behind his back and gives it to dr parnassus
hold this piece of wire
you wont feel a thing
george takes the end of the wire
im going to put the tips of my fingers on the top of your head
he does so
i want you to relax and try as far as possible to think of nothing
thats not difficult
in my condition
doctor parnassus closes his eyes
he seems to be making an effort
hold your breath
george does so
very good very good
yes i see
doctor parnassus takes his hand from georges head and gives the contraption back to percy
you may breathe normally
the effort seems to have tired parnassus
he needs to sit down
alas this technique has its limitations
did you discover anything
dramatically your name
what is it
stunned my god
they call me tony
thats who i am
valentina and anton begin to pay attention and gather around
you used to do good works
something to do with charity i think
dismissively its an ancient technique of mental divination but im very rusty and it doesnt always work satisfactorily
but thats amazing
oddly concerned was there anything else
doctor parnassus shakes his head no
relieved thats absolutely fantastic
perhaps ill remember other things
parnassus smiles and bows slightly ironically
i knew you were a good person
so what was he doing dangling under a bridge from his neck
sarcastic oh dear was that a rude question
have i put my foot in it
thats so strange
its a complete blank
but i do remember i was involved in some sort of charity
trying to do good to make the world a better place you know
inspire people give them hope
self deprecatingly what an arrogant idiot
valentina looks at him thinking what a sympathetic person
the sound of a flutey whistle distracts him
anton is blowing a tune on the metal tube he found on the bridge
with a superior air mozarts flute concerto in g
i mean the pipe
where did you get it
anton looks at the metal pipe
i found it
youre a musician n now
its not a musical instrument
may i have it
teasing are you s sure its yours
anton appears to offer the pipe to tony but palms it so that when tony reaches out to take it its gone
its g gone
getting shirty dont fool around
ah there it is
tony once more tries to take it
once more anton makes it disappear
angry give it to me
anton thats enough
she steps forward takes the pipe from anton and gives it to thank you
parnassus whos been watching this exchange looks thoughtful
parnassus and co are preparing to move out and do a show
anton is working near parnassus and percy who are unaware of his presence
whats eating anton
anton pricks up his ears
hes in love with valentina
dumbfounded in love
the little snake
ill skin him alive
cut to anton who winces
while youre at it dont forget the other one
parnassus looks at percy questioningly
the viper the scorpion the amnesiac boa constrictor
quite another kettle of fish
hes ambitious energetic
a man of destiny
ironic and hes going to help us win five souls
i think he might
valentina sees good in him
shed be better off with anton
cut to anton whos pleased
perhaps i should offer her hand to whoever helps most in winning the next five souls
cut to anton who looks puzzled
thats even worse than the other ideas youve had today
sighs youre not wrong
ah percy what would i do without you
get a midget
cut to anton as he moves thoughtfully away
the theatre parked outside a pub is up and running
anton as mercury is doing his pitch
sleep no more
procrastinate no longer
embrace this once in a life time opportunity
let the mind of doctor parnassus be the portal to the infinite world of your imagination
behind the curtain percy is signalling valentina to see if doctor parnassus has been drinking
she sniffs him
what are you doing
weve got a tremendous amount of work to do tonight
a great deal depends on it
a roll on the drums from percy
the curtain rises
doctor parnassus floats above the stage on his glass plinth
as old as the universe itself the great doctor versed in every mystic practice known to man and many more besides will guide you to your destiny
however the audience a few passers by and drinkers who have drifted out of the pub for a smoke arent much interested in anton
instead they pay more attention to the masked tony who decked out in a stylish costume is working the sparse crowd with his smooth charm
anton irritated glances back at doctor parnassus who is worried about the lack of customers
tony is now surrounded by fascinated women
they laugh at one of his jokes
one pretty young woman sally in particular seems to be smitten by the handsome actor
tony smiles seductively at her
the sight provokes anton
he leaps off the stage grabs sally by the wrist and begins to pull her to the stage
percy keeps playing
hey what you doing
t taking you to the heart of your imagination
anton is trying to compete with tony but just cant manage the charm
good humoured oh my god
you wont regret it
go for it sal
indicating friend only if she comes with me
enthusiastic now youre talking
a few onlookers cheer
n not at the same time
anton is still pulling sally onto the stage
im not going on my own
your imagination is a very special place
doctor parnassus will make it flower
i bet he will
well do it together
shakes his head no
t two c competing imaginations in the imaginarium at the same time
its n not advisable
the stronger imagination will overcome the weaker and then theres n no knowing what might happen
thats really stupid
d dont be afraid d dear lady
youll be safe with me
anton sweeps her off her feet and carries her onto the stage
put me down
have no fear
she doesnt want to do it on her own
only b because she d doesnt realize
let go of her you silly pillock
valentina worried steps forward to try and restrain anton
staggering under the weight of the struggling sally anton barges into doctor parnassus on his glass plinth
the plinth rocks and teeters
valentina tries to stop it falling
anton unaware of what hes done disappears through the mirror as doctor parnassus crashes head first onto the stage
from behind the mirror comes the sound of a womans terrifying terrified screams
theyve got her in there
thats her screaming
they doing something to her
upstage valentina tends the stunned doctor
he clutches his head in pain
terrified anton and the screaming sally are spun through a black void clinging desperately to an asteroid as planets and stars spin madly around them
blood red lightning bolts crackle and crash
out front the crowd larger now is reacting badly to the dreadful screams
sallys friends try to storm the stage
tony and percy try to hold them back
i promise you
a middle aged woman hits him with her handbag
tony and percy are in danger of being overwhelmed
we can still hear sally screaming from somewhere within the stage
ladies and gentlemen
ladies and gentlemen
a drunk takes a swing at percy misses and connects with ugh
he falls off the stage and disappears into the angry crowd who begin pummelling and kicking him
percy desperate produces a pistol and fires a couple of shots into the air
everyone dives for cover
percy taking advantage of the temporary lull begins to race around untying unhooking and pulling on ropes
the theatre begins to close up as the horses bolt and the wagon clatters off down the street bits falling off as it goes
somebody call the police
a battered tony chased by the enraged crowd just manages to clamber on board with the help of valentina
the wagon narrowly succeeds in out pacing the fastest of the crowd
as it disappears down the street a figure is dumped unceremoniously out through the back door of the wagon
its the terrified sally sent sprawling in the middle of the road
a figure steps out from the shadows to help her to her feet
nick in his bowler and red waistcoat
a police siren howls as the wagon comes crashing around the corner of a great rubbish tip and clatters to a halt
the horses steaming sections of the theatre hanging loose broken
an utter mess
the siren fades into the distance
amongst collapsed scenery parnassus lies in a heap
the others are struggling to their feet
anton is desperately trying to do something useful to help parnassus but valentina pushes him out of the way
what were you thinking
look what youve done
get out of the way
appealing to tony tony
tony battered and bleeding helps her lift parnassus and manoeuvre him to his room
anton is mortified
percy pats him on the back
better luck next time
tony helps valentina get parnassus comfortable
babbling this is my punishment
all is lost
first to five
first to five
no time valentina
we are doomed
very concerned ssshhhh
tony nods leaves slowly
percy is angrily banging about trying to repair the damage
anton is trying to help but is just getting in the way
do me a favour
take a long walk off a short pier
can i help
tony finds anton sitting despondently a short way from the wagon swigging from a bottle
he sits down next to him
l leave me alone
what were you doing to that girl behind the mirror
incensed what are you suggesting
we all heard her screaming
i was screaming as well
it was t terrifying
i dont understand
reluctantly no well
youve n never been inside the d doctors mind have you
your not trying to tell me that mind control stuff is real
you think its some k kind of scam d dont you
but i d dont expect you to g get it
n not in a million years
if he can really control peoples minds why isnt he ruling the world
why bother with this crappy side show
he d doesnt want to rule the world d does he
he wants the world to rule itself
what a waste
tell me about the mirror
whats the point of that if not to razzle dazzle the public
smiles sardonically youre way off the mark
taking a swig its a b bloody great mystery
wrapped in a b brown p paper b bag enema
or do i mean enigma
he pulls himself up and starts to stagger off
one more thing
does first to five mean anything to you
anton looks at tony with loathing
i thought you were the c clever one
he walks away into the darkness
tony sits there busily thinking
the morning light suffuses mountains of domestic refuse
rubbish for as far as the eye can see
plastic sacks of various colours many spilling open
a few fires are burning
flocks of scavenging sea gulls hover and dive screaming blue murder
on one of the many pinnacles of garbage sits a lonely figure
its anton depressed angry forlorn
the camera swings round to show below anton in a valley of waste material the wagon
percy has spread out the broken scenery assessing the damage
in the shadow of the wagon valentina is changing tonys dressings
thank god its only cuts and bruises
i thought wed lost you
if you hadnt been there
he holds her hand
looks deep into her eyes
valentina your father seems in a terrible state
is it the police
maybe i can help
i dont know whats wrong with him but if its about the show
i dont care
im tired of it
let the police arrest us
im sick of living like this
she looks miserable
tony puts his arms around her
holds her tightly to him
dont say that
what youre doing is important
it should be done in a different way
he is about to kiss her
what sort of different way do you suggest
parnassus grim faced head bandaged steps from behind the wagon
tony and valentina quickly disengage
oh hello good morning sir
how are you feeling
that was a nasty bump on the head you got
beady eyed different
well sir ive been thinking
its clear the shows not attracting many people
forgive me but
i see two ways of tackling this problem
either the style of the show is at fault
or the type of audience
i would suggest changing both
percy has appeared dragging a damaged flat
change the show
who the fizzing hell do you think you are
he sits down heavily
im sorry but
youre not modern
people want modern
he holds open a tattered fashion magazine to a page of beautifully photographed models in a fabulously magical setting
he thumbs through more pages of dreamy images
this is modern
trust me i understand this world
with a wink this kind of mind control
lets try to meet the public halfway
the right public
and in a better part of town
from behind the wagon anton watches forlornly
alone and unnoticed by the others
what about the filth
therell be a better class of police too
thatll be the day
the trick is not to hide
change your colours
go where they would least expect to find you
i think we have been brought together for a reason
i dont believe in coincidence
you saved my life
now let me do something in return
parnassus confers with percy
our times nearly up
this could be what we need
to valentina this can be my birthday gift to valentina
valentina smiles and nods to parnassus
with a burst of energy for gods sake lets do it
sighs yeah okay but what exactly do we do
first of all i want you to give me your money
all of it
parnassus percy and valentina look at each other
then parnassus sees something beyond the wagon
anton downcast heading off through the swirling plastic bags and flying rubbish
a battered suitcase in his hand
where are you going
no answer from anton
valentina runs after him but he marches on silently
what are you doing
didnt you do enough damage last night
pummmelling his back anton
im the one who wants to run away
he slows are you trying to wreck my birthday or what
anton stops still not looking at valentina he slowly drops his suitcase
we need you
moved anton turns to her
she smiles sweetly
how much money have you got
close up on parnassuss glass plinth
now open topped and sitting on the edge of the stage
full of the troupes savings
a sign proclaims please take generously directly behind the glass box is a half globe with the continent of africa featured
sitting on top is percy playing something ethnic but tasteful on a flute with one hand
his other is held out pathetically
hes blacked up and dressed in rags
he doesnt look happy
he sneaks nervous glances at the glass box of money
the wagon newly painted in sleek and stylish black and white stands in bond street or some similarly fashionable street with expensive shops and art galleries
rich women anxious to be conspicuous in their consumption of wealth glide past
new signs proclaim the choice is yours the imaginarium more exclusive than ever
the stage hung with soft flowing gauzy fabric has been chromatically divided in half one side black the other white
on the dark side a bloated sun glassed woman consuming vast quantities of food reclines on an elaborate lounge
she is in fact a very uncomfortable anton in full and fulsome drag
center stage stands dr
parnassus dressed as a stylized doctor with head reflector
in his hand is a staff with an elaborate sun on the top
he is blindfolded
on the white side of the stage stands the mirror and a stylized tree of knowledge with bright red apples
under the tree and reflected in the mirror sits valentina as eve
naked except for a long wig that maintains her modesty
she gracefully combs her hair
above the mirror is a sign proclaiming the naked truth
parnassus peeking under his blindfold is distinctly uncomfortable by his daughters lack of attire
tony in a beautifully cut white suit and wearing his romantic venetian carnival mask sits in profile in a dreamy pose on the edge of the white side of the
they pay no attention to the crowd
a few women stop curious
one of them takes out some money and puts it in the glass plinth and turns to go
retrieving the money excuse me madam
im afraid we cant accept this
the woman stops confused
tony hands her back her money
we are here to give
we are here to help those in need
if its money you need then here it is
referring to the glass plinth if its the flowering of the soul you need then here we are but unfortunately we are booked solid at the moment
but thank you
i can see you have a generous spirit
tony returns to his pensive pose
the women look at each other
excuse me but how does this work
what does it cost
money is no good in the imaginarium
this is a refuge for hearts in need of truth
a place for souls to be purified
how long does that take
im running late
madam why should you care about time
what are your dreams worth in minutes
the women grow pensive
there are hard choices to be made in life
he indicates the tableaux what about the dreams of the less fortunate in the world
do you have time for their dreams
or are you like i once was
do you just despair
despair at all that is wrong in the world
getting to his feet despair at your inability to do anything to change it
to make it better
i despaired so much at the powerlessness of my own existence that i took the easy way out
the cowards way
i committed suicide
yes thats right i killed myself
can you understand my despair
but i was saved
saved by a miracle
and doctor parnassus
he brought me back from the dead
he gave me a new life
a reason to live
he has given me power to dream again
to dream of a better world
during his speech more and more people have gathered
some are actually weeping
they are press forward putting money in the plinth
tony tries to stop them but they insist
valentina anton percy and dr
parnassus are astonished by tonys performance
excuse me can one make a booking
are you taking bookings
stop pushing at the back
form a queue
please im sorry but were booked solid at the moment
a louis vuitton dressed woman years old at the back of the crowd shouts is that child up for adoption
she points at the blacked up percy
i want to adopt that unfortunate black child
it shouldnt be working like this
it should be in school
percy is appalled
whos in charge here
the louis vuitton woman looks around as a couple of police officers arrive on the scene
tony spots them too and heads off the louis vuitton woman as she makes towards them
madam congratulations you have been chosen
the other women gasp
come forward and enter the imaginarium
but i havent paid
we dont want your money
we want your hopes and dreams
you may make a donation later if you wish
this is a rare moment
very few are chosen
dont miss this once in a life time opportunity
he ushers the uneasy louis vuitton woman onto the stage and guides her upstage
parnassus goes into his trance
believe me madam youre the luckiest woman in the world
the louis vuitton woman steps into the mirror
a moment of uncertainty
valentina encourages him with a smile
he steps through
across the street a clock begins striking the hour
cut to the two police officers who start to move the crowd and show on
alright i think its time to move on folks
but on spotting the naked valentina who winks at them they agree between themselves to give the show a bit longer
tony and the louis vuitton woman are astonished to find themselves in the romantic soft focus pastel colour setting of a soothing sophisticated shampoo commercial
soft fabrics waft cleansing waterfalls cascade rose petals float through the air beautiful girls swing from swings attached to clouds all in delicious slow motion
the louis vuitton woman takes tonys hand and looks at him meaningfully
tony disorientated takes a moment to regain his composure
he smiles and with an effort puts his arm around the louis vuitton womans wide waist
he looks into her eyes
shes in love
moans softly ohhh
and i dont even know your name
a bar or two of tango encourages them to take a couple of intimate tango dance steps
now gently wafting curtains part to reveal
down a flower strewn path and over a bridge
a sleazy motel with a shingle over the door reads the one night stand motel
in the office window sits mr
nick oh goodness me
she bats her eyelashes at tony and begins knowingly to pull him towards the motel
resisting if im not wrong i fear you must go alone
the louis vuitton woman pouts playfully pulling him onwards
why would i want to go without you darling
its one of the rules
one imagination at a time free from the influence of another
they have reached the bridge
stairs descend to a stream
below them a gondola rests in the stream as small flower bedecked barques float past with framed pictures of romantic heroes who died young keats shelly byron james dean rudolph
valentino marilyn monroe buddy holly princess diana
the stream continues off into the distance to a dark towering egyptian pyramid
tony is as bemused as the louis vuitton woman
you must make a choice
actually to be honest id strongly recommend this one
rudolph valentino james dean princess di
all these people
thinking fast exactly
to be reborn first you must die
all of them have achieved a kind of immortality
and we love them all the more for it
they wont get old or fat
they wont get sick or feeble
they are beyond fear
they are forever young
they are gods
and you can join them
softening youre such a wonderful speaker
the gondola awaits
with a beautiful male model at the helm
the louis vuitton woman smiles at him
theres not a moment to lose
but as she hesitates a dark shadow rises over them
tony looking past the woman s shoulder sees the dark waters of the stream rise up transforming into a gigantic king cobra that towers menacingly over them
its wearing a bowler hat
and its angry
but your sacrifice must be pure
you have to let go of all these worldly goods
he helps the louis vuitton woman remove her necklace earrings bracelets rings broach in double quick time and guides her onto the gondola blowing a kiss after her
remember nothing is permanent
not even death
he turns back to see the gigantic king cobra shrinking back below the bridge transforming itself back into the waters of the stream
from under the arch of the bridge hangs a rope
at its end
a hangmans noose
tony stares at it darkly disconcerted
tony re enters the stage through the mirror looking at dr
parnassus who has just come out of his trance with astonishment gobsmacked that was so
i had no idea
and then he realizes the clock is still striking the hour realizing that only a few moments have passed since he entered the mirror
how do you do this
ignoring him and with a big theatrical gesture hooplah
the louis vuitton woman reappears sitting on a cut out cloud descending from the ceiling of the stage
she looks radiant
she is weeping completely overcome by her experience
parnassus steps forward and helps her to her feet
she kisses his hands in gratitude
thank you thank you that was so beautiful i feel so
thank you so much
graciously thank you dear lady you give me strength to continue born again tearful but transcendent the louis vuitton woman produces her cheque book and begins to write a cheque
tony is frozen confused
the crowd is still
stunned by the louis vuitton womans transformation as she deposits the cheque her handbag her expensive coat in the glass box and glides benignly through the crowd
which parts in awe
and then the other women rush the stage
mayhem is narrowly averted as tony and percy manage to coral them into a more or less orderly queue
across the street standing in the doorway of a shop selling luxury goods is mr nick
he watches events intrigued
as tony escorts a second woman through the mirror and a third they descend ecstatic emptying the contents of their handbags their pearls earrings and diamond rings into the glass
tony pays off the cops who move on
tony getting more and more flamboyant forgets to lower his mask each time he re enters the stage
and now a fourth woman descends
four successes for doctor parnassus
aside to percy one more to go and were free
doctor parnassus spots mr nick across the street smiles holds up four fingers
mr nick gives a little im not impressed smirk and turns away and pretends to be interested in the luxury goods in the shop window as four large dark heavy
russian men all laden with luxury shopping walk past
one of the russians stops
looking at the show
at tony whose mask is sitting on top of his head
the leading russian pulls him on
what are you watching that crap for
pointing at tony its him
who are you talking about
following serges pointed finger impossible
they start pushing through the crowd
tony reaching down to help an elderly lady up to the stage looks up and sees the russians heading through the crowd
he pulls the mask down and begins to back up
but its too late theyve definitely seen him
he spins around and rockets upstage past dr
parnassus who is deep into his trance
tony dives through the mirror much to the amazement of the russians chase after him shoving the queuing women aside smashing the scenery and knocking anton into the wings
the russians charge through the shampoo commercial landscape
just slo mo fashion models and soft wafting fabrics and aromatic breezes
where did he go
you tell me
it cant be him
we killed him
so why did he run
there he is
in the distance tony is hiding behind some billowing fabric
on being spotted he takes off up a hill
the russians race toward the hill only to crash into a solid wall painted as a landscape with tony frozen in mid stride
looking off to their right they see tony heading up another hill
but as they rush in that direction another wall rises up blocking them
again it is painted with a hill and tony frozen in midstride
a third and fourth wall rise up
surrounding and trapping the russians
there is a cell door in one wall
like crazy animals they start throwing themselves against the door trying to break it down
it wont budge
while the others batter the door gregor who has been somewhat affected by the soft shampoo commercial world sits quietly in a corner picking pretty flowers
exhausted the other russians collapse on the ground
gregor gently breathes in the aroma of the flowers and exhales
as he does the door swings open
the other russians gape at him
then barrel out the door
outside is a new beautiful landscape the sky dotted with white fluffy clouds
extending from the ground to each cloud is an incredibly long ladder
on each ladder is a person climbing upwards
the russians spot tony
he is already a hundred feet up a ladder and climbing
unfortunately their way is blocked by an over bright hyper active wide eyed sales girl
reach for the clouds
discover your true potential
gift certificates are available at
the russians roughly shove her aside
as they rush past gregor pauses hands her his flowers
smell the flowers
reaching the base of tonys ladder the russians start climbing
seeing the threat tony kicks hard and breaks the rungs below him
setting off a domino effect with more rungs breaking downward towards the russians
rungs break in their grasp
the russians land in a tangled heap as the domino effect continues down to the base of the ladder
laughing down at them tony turns to continue climbing only to see the domino effect heading down from the top of the ladder
tony struggles to maintain his balance and somehow manages to get his feet on the two halves of a broken rung
then as if he were on giant stilts starts to stride away
the russians chase after him but his giant strides leave them far behind
smugly tony looks back just as one of the legs of his ladder snags on a fallen log
he loses his balance
and plunges hundreds of feet earthward
from nowhere anton still dressed as a fat woman appears
running to catch the plummeting tony
he does and whomp
knocked out cold
tony is unscathed
his fall broken by antons padding
but the russians arrive grab tony start to beat him up
you thieving scumbag
we break every bone in your body
they scrawl strange symbols on tonys forehead
i can explain
give me a chance
we want our money or you die again
this time for good
anton struggles to his feet
l leave him alone
the russians turn and thinking anton is a fat bossy middle aged woman hesitate
stand b back
im warning you
foolishly he whips off his wig and assumes a manly martial arts pose
the russians look at each other
then utterly ignoring anton turn their attention back to beating tony
gregor walks calmly over to anton who is in attack mode
bending down and picking a flower he offers it to relax
smell the flowers
confused anton takes the flower sniffs and then
gregor floors him with a powerful punch on the nose meanwhile the russians have a noose around tonys neck and have looped the rope over a tree branch
tony struggles to pull out the metal pipe he keeps on a string around his neck
he gets it to his mouth as if to swallow it when
the ground erupts and a giant london policemans helmet rises up we are talking feet tall and revolves revealing dr
parnassus carved and painted face beneath
the mouth drops open and a great red tongue rolls out like a welcoming red carpet
from inside the giant mouth a smiling policeman beckons the russians to come on in
the terrified russians let go of the lynching rope
tony drops to the ground and with a whistle the brass pipe flies out of his mouth
behind the russians a painted backdrop unfurls
it reads join the fuzz
we love violence
and a chorus line of long legged girls in mini skirted police outfits appear high kicking a snappy song and dance number
the astonished russians dont know what the fuck is going on
suddenly a friendly old womans voice is heard shouting something in russian
spinning around the russians see an old baboushka russian grandmother outside a tumble down cottage waving gaily to them
a stunned pause
then pell mell they rush to her
as they run toward her they get smaller and smaller
she lifts her skirts and all four disappear underneath
a muffled explosion balloons the skirts outward
smoke spews out from below
straightening her skirt the baboushka looks up and pulls off her head revealing mr
nicks tiny head poking out of the collar
he smiles smugly
the giant policeman dr
parnassus registers disappointment and like a balloon rapidly deflating spins off into the sky sending up a cloud of dust obscuring everything
the dust clears and tony and anton find themselves in a desolate empty landscape
did you see me
i almost reached the clouds
i could have
it was incredible
i was almost there
over a distant rise the wagon appears pulled by the horses
anton drags tony babbling and stumbling towards it
i made my choice and i climbed
i felt so much potential
i could have done anything
i have to have another chance
i need this
the wagon is parked on waste ground
it looms out of nowhere illuminated by a light leaking from within
we hear percys angry voice
maybe you were holding them upside down
the bloody tarot cards
distraught and angry enough percy
i made a mistake
a big mistake
i know that and im sorry
the angry troupe huddles amongst the clutter of props and jumbled scenery
tony is on trial
parnassus is sitting in a corner head in hands
he seems utterly destroyed
youre a l liar
youve been lying to us all along
who are you
who were those thugs
i am not a liar
didnt divulge everything i knew
comes to the same thing
not in law
you stole their money
thats what they said
are you going to believe them before you believe me
because theyre irredeemably bad people and im essentially good
i know that sounds terribly prim and arrogant and self righteous but im trying to be honest
look the truth is
in order to get my charity off the ground i needed capital
anton looks askance
in response to anton yes i know and youre right but thats the way the grown up
the real world works
you cant make omelettes without soiling your hands
or should that be the other way round
anyway i with hindsight very foolishly accepted a loan from people who seemed to me at the time to be very decent and sincere
there was absolutely no way i could have known that they were part of a ruthless organised crime syndicate and that they wanted to use my charity to launder money
i made a mistake
and i have to live with that
what more can i say
valentina wants to believe tony
anton and percy dont
distressed but basically sympathetic oh tony
but can we not talk about me for a moment
i want to thank the doctor for letting me experience the most sublime inspiring
so why were they trying to k kill you
is what they said
answering his own question the first time they hung you from the b bridge
b because you stole their money
stop saying that
i didnt steal it
i didnt have it
id had to invest in infrastructure
i needed more time
when you run a charity you have to give lots of money away
you wouldnt believe the red tape
the charity commission are a bunch of fascists
cmon give me a break
i almost died today
and i said im sorry
this was supposed to be a special day
its valentinas birthday
he pulls out the louis vuitton womans beautiful necklace from his pocket
for a beautiful woman
he puts it around valentinas neck
the marks on your face
they scrawled something on your forehead
tony looks uncomfortable tries to rub his forehead clean
you had some of those when we rescued you
yes whats that about
but before he can say anything theres a knock on the door which startles everyone
they exchange looks
parnassus is frightened but hides this from the others
the knock is repeated
percy starts to get up
sotto voce no
percy sits down
the knock comes again
sotto voce to the dr
who is it
sotto voce its too late
once more someone knocks
everyone is edgy
particularly the knock comes again
sotto voce agitated please can we answer the door
i cant stand not answering the door or the telephone or whatever
its not in my nature
i wont sleep for weeks if we dont answer the door
parnassus gets up goes to the door opens it and steps outside closing the door behind him
valentina anton percy and tony exchange looks
embarrassed sorry i just
ive got a thing about
parnassus and mr nick move away from the door and go around to the front
the stage is half opened
the horses are standing steaming nearby
very down i know
four rotten russkies
and the girl
from the pub
mr nick shakes his head
sally doesnt count
do you gal
sally the woman thrown out from the wagon as they escaped from the pub mob steps out of the shadows puts her arms around nick youre joking
toying with me
like a cat with a mouse
as is your privilege
sal didnt get to make a real choice
you were gaga
out for the count
wouldnt be fair
and youve got four thanks to your friend tony
its not quite over
he smiles lights a cigarette takes a deep drag
checks his watch oh oh look at the time
and he wanders off into the darkness with sally
somewhere a clock strikes
parnassus agitated watches him go
parnassus looks round to find valentina standing next to him
he starts to round up the horses
my darling girl
we must do another show
get ready to move out
who was that
somebody asking the way
i overheard you
he wasnt asking the way
get everybody together
i want to know whats going on
harnessing the horses not now
i want to know the truth
what are you hiding
there are more important things at this moment
its something to do with that bloody rambling story you were telling me the night we found tony isnt it
he checks his watch yes
so tell me
what i told you was
i really am thousands of years old
i have been immortal
i have been mortal
and i have had many dealings with the devil
fearful what are you saying
remember the woman i was telling you about
the one i was so desperately in love with
so in love that i made a deal with the devil
that was your mother
she was so beautiful so enchanting
looking at valentina dr
parnassus sees her morph into the beautiful woman appearing
he almost swoons
she was everything i had ever dreamed of
i made a choice
i bargained away my immortality
i regained my youth
and i won her
i won her
the beautiful woman morphs back into valentina
but at a price
parnassus looks haggard
he closes his eyes
he sways and loses his balance
valentina stops him from falling
anguished its too terrible
the price of my obsession
he groans i cant say it
i was mortal again
on condition that
any children i fathered
would on their sixteenth birthday
belong to him
valentina cant take it in
your mother never knew
she died before i had to tell her
i dont believe this
it cant be true
its just another of your wretched stories
a cruel story
why do you say these things
but all is not lost
valentina looks at him
feverishly a new wager
the first of five
if i win
youre mine again
and we can win
we can still win
by playing games with the devil
with one more show
the day isnt over
all my life youve made me play beauty truth justice
filled my head with dreams and high ideals
all that crap
all the time
the devil was right
vain and arrogant
im just another one of your stupid wagers
youre beneath contempt
she rushes off into the dark night
thats not true
its not like that
a dark silhouette stands in the shadow of the wagon
what has he heard
parnassus rushes into the wagon
percy is already on his feet having heard the doctor shouting
anton rushes out
percy stops by dr
parnassus before he exits
telling the truth
always a bad idea
anton running calling for valentina
percy is scouring the area on horseback
anton running though a newspaper filled tip sees a headline on one of the newspapers
parnassus a bottle in his hand is lurching around
you monstrous fool
you should be dead
he starts to violently bang his head against the side of the wagon
suddenly the stage begins to unfold
parnassus looks up unable to see what or who is doing this
he drunkenly stumbles around the side to see tony pulling ropes
what are you doing
i overheard you
you only need one more to win
ill be that one
ill take the risk to save valentina and hopefully you sir
weve still got a few minutes
tony steers doctor parnassus towards his glass column
to himself how about thanking me
i expect nothing in return
trying to go into a trance no
youre a saint
only valentinas hand in marriage if shell have me
not listening oh my head
and as your son in law
initiation into the secrets of the trance
i cant do it
realizing parnassus is referring to his inability to go into a trance why not
i cant concentrate
im too upset
you must do it
you have to do it
its the only way to save your daughter
distraught i know
sitting parnassus down concentrate
you must concentrate
clearing the way to the mirror ill make the right choice
im sure of it
i can feel how right it is already
tony leaps back to steady dr
parnassus who looked as though he were about to topple off his pillar
we can save her
you and me
i need this
we both need this
parnassus quiets down
tony rushes to the mirror
he finds himself standing amongst the stage scenery
he steps back out of the mirror
goes to parnassus who is weeping
its no good
tony shakes him hard
pull yourself together
or youll have lost her forever
parnassus slowly goes into a sobbing kind of trance state
tony confirms he is in a trance then rushes to the mirror
there in the shadows huddles valentina sobbing
sobbing its useless
i thought i was strong but i dont even know how to run away
he looks back to parnassus who seems to still be in his trance
then rushes to its alright
its going to be alright believe me
this stupid theatre
thats all ive ever known
ive always believed it was something precious but its not
its a lie
i hate it
tony lifts her up putting his arm around her
everythings going to be alright
ill take you away
ill show you the world
the great big beautiful world ive always dreamed of
youll love it
valentina grateful clings to tony
they turn to the mirror but an off stage clearing of the throat makes them look round to see anton watching them
hes holding a torn and dirty piece of newspaper
ah there you are tony
heres something m might interest you
reading missing d disgraced head of childrens charity
tony tries to snatch the paper but anton steps back
n not a bad p picture tony
listen to this valentina
its about tonys b beautiful world
where are you
parnassus is still in his trance but mumbling
anthony shepherd who was arrested last week on charges of
valentina is surrounded
to valentina valentina dont listen to that
this is the work of people who are trying to destroy me
look ill show you the truth
tony pulls valentina towards the mirror
anton tries to stop him but tony pushes him back off the stage
he crashes to the ground
grabbing valentina hurry
tony and valentina disappear through the mirror
sobbing in his trance valentina
mist and rain descend as tony and valentina run through the darkened shapes of the shampoo commercial landscape now tattered ragged and wind blown
this isnt right
this is all wrong
soaked and cold they spy a welcome sight
a uniformed valet with an open umbrella stands by the door of a sleek limo
your car is here mr
ah lester just in time
tony ducks under the umbrella and helps valentina into the car ahead of himself
as she slides across the seat she notices the driver bowler hatted and smoking a cigarette
tony dont get in
she pushes tony back and scrambles out
dragging him back out into the dark rain
the driver turns around
valentina and tony struggle through the rain
suddenly they find themselves in deep water up to their chests
they are sinking
through the mist they see a boat
it is the gondola that transported the louis vuitton lady
the boatman turns the boat in their direction
tony tries to pull himself on board
the boatman reaches down to help
give me your hand its mr
valentina recoils drags tony off the boat
what are you doing
no we wont
this is the way
she points to jumbled rocks just visible in the darkness
they drag themselves onto them
the rocky monoliths appear to be the same as the landscape anton climbed over when he was searching for diego the son of the family from hell
and like a repeat of that experience from behind the ridge rises the parnassus faced mongolfier balloon
but now the eyes stream tears and rain pours down
in the basket is dont d do it
dont g go on
not with him
hes all lies
just like my father
leave me alone
i dont care anymore
i want a new life
he pulls her away
towards a little tumble down cottage
warm candlelight glows in the windows smoke curls from the chimney
they run to the door
tony bangs on it
someone can be heard unlatching the locks inside
a childs crying cuts through the wind
valentina turns and sees a little girl sitting on the path
among flapping laundry
she rushes to her tries to pick her up but the little girl resists
tony help me shes heavy
the door has just opened and tony is halfway through
he turns irritated
what is it now
cant we just go inside and get dry
behind him in the warmth stands the old baboushka
seeing that valentina is really struggling with the little girl tony reluctantly goes to help
the little girl on seeing tony tries to break away but he holds on to her
shouting angrily ostanobuite bas menshi schit
the litle girl goes quiet
valentina looks at tony with surprise
the baboushka looks angry
suddenly a light begins to suffuse tony and the little girl
a small orchestra can be heard playing garden party music
you did it
you made the right choice
the light fills the screen and we find
tony sleekly groomed and immaculately dressed holding the smiling little girl
she too has been cleaned and buffed
the sun shines
he stands in
a large well kept lawn covered with smart guests business behind and beyond them is an impressive country house
a small orchestra is playing
there is a marquee
waiters and waitresses move amongst the assembled notables bearing trays of drinks and food
tony is the focus of attention
a tv current affairs news journalist with camera crew is following him around
sustainabilitys great if you can achieve it
the problem is in many cases you simply cant for a whole variety of reasons
tony smiles and shakes the hand of someone in a wheelchair
a group of guests burst into spontaneous applause
everybody loves and admires tony
he smiles boyishly
he moves on
the tv crew stay with him
arent you running the risk of entrenching the need for charity by increasingly institutionalising it
look charity like poor little olga
referring to the little girl is always with us to coin a phrase
she is beautifully dressed coiffed made up she looks stunning
to valentina ah there you are my lovely
she and tony exchange broad smiles
theyre in love
he pulls her to his side and puts his arm around her
the photographers snap away
and whats your message to the prime minister
laughs engagingly i wouldnt presume to have a message for the prime minister
fortunately for the foundation i think we pretty much see eye to eye on most things
now we hear a distant buzzing
everybody looks up
they see a speck in the sky its the prime ministers approaching helicopter
tony and the posse of journalists and photographers rush off leaving valentina standing alone
the prime minister and his wife get out of the helicopter followed by their aides
tony and the prime minister shake hands for the tv cameras
valentina watches from a distance
a huge chandelier illuminates a grand ornate ballroom where wealthy guests in evening dress are being seated at tables by liveried ushers
large beautiful photographs of the underprivileged children of the world line the walls
a great banner reads suffer the little children benefit ball the prime minister and his wife are seated at the head table facing the dais bubbly and expectant
security is heavy
tony is conferring with his speech writers and assistants as valentina descends the staircase looking utterly stunning in a beautiful gown
tony bows romantically kissing her hand
he turns her to admire their reflections in a gilt mirror
the perfect beautiful dream couple
you look gorgeous my love
i knew you wouldnt let me down
the little girl olga and a little boy are brought forward
they are dressed in ethnic clothes
tony takes olgas hand
offers the little boys hand to valentina
she takes it in her own
the four of them start to walk to the door leading to the ballroom
looking to everyone this is a vitally important moment for the future of the foundation
the children of the world are depending on us
tony and valentina look around
anton is nowhere to be seen but his voice continues
all of this is false
its nothing to do with you
its all him
its his imagination
call security somebody
its all rotten
a naked lie
youve got to understand
the little boy is tugging valentinas arm
she looks down
a child size anton
look at this
he produces the newspaper with tonys photo and news story
tony lunges for him but anton dodges out of the way
reading and dodging the disgraced director of the childrens charity suffer the little children who was arrested last
security guards have rushed in
silence the little bastard
dodging the guards who was arrested last week on charges of involvement in the sale of organs from third world children to wealthy westerners
tony has grabbed little anton and starts hitting him
and now he doesnt stutter
it was all an act to get cheap sympathy
pulling tony off anton take your hands off him
get off me
what are you doing
lashing out and hitting valentina in the face youve betrayed me
you let him in
into my world you bitch
after all ive lavished on you
little anton has leapt on tonys back and sunk his teeth into tonys ear
tony throws him off and starts beating him
in the glittering ballroom a childrens choir sings
we are the world
we are the children
behind the choir the double doors of the ballroom crash open
exposing tony violently beating up an ethnic child
stunned silence as the horror of this happy scene sinks in
somebody stop him
hes a monster
as one they leap to their feet
tony looks up and freezes
at the same time the walls of the ballroom begin to crack and disintegrate
tonys world starts to fall apart
the floor around tony falls away into an abyss leaving only a narrow escape route
he hurls anton aside and dashes away as the guests pursue him
anton avoids being trampled but loses his footing and falls over the edge
valentina fighting through the angry guests rushes to the edge of the abyss
anton is struggling to hold on to a broken floor joist that protrudes several feet down from the side of the cliff face
his grip slips
valentina reaches for him grasps his hand
forgive me anton
i was wrong
im not a child
anton reverts to his normal size
i love you valentina
anton slips out of her grip plummeting into the abyss
suddenly valentina is jerked backwards by her hair
whos behind this
you didnt come up with this all on your own did you
slapping her no
someones got at you
someones paid you
my darling daughter
there you are
they turn to see parnassus in the distance where once the ballroom stood stumbling towards them drunk desperate
as he moves forward a new landscape is created behind him
tony rushes towards parnassus
you old bastard
this is all your doing
drunkenly all my doing
im merely the facilititatater dear boy
there he is
leave her alone
throwing his arm around tony parnassus spins him around to face the mob rushing towards him
i create the opportunities
is it my fault if your not up to it
tony wrenches his arm free and violently shoves the drunken doctor right into the path of the frenzied mob
parnassus is trampled underfoot in their rush to catch tony
parnassuss body lies broken on the ground
frantically valentina rushes to him throwing herself on her fathers battered body sobbing hysterically
its all my fault
what have i done
with siren wailing an ambulance arrives screeching to a halt
paramedics pull valentina away
they check parnassus for signs of life and begin to lift him onto the gurney
valentina cant control herself and tries to throw herself onto his body
the paramedics struggle with her
with a severe stutter p p p lease m mis s theres s n n othing y y y you c can d d o he he hes d d
valentina wrenches herself out of their grasp howling like an animal and rushes away out of earshot before the paramedic can finish speaking
d dead drunk
a bottle falls from the doctors hand and explodes in a million fragments as it hits the ground
the shimmering fragments coalesce into a fractured mirror corridor down which a multi reflected valentina runs sobbing like a madwoman lashing out at her reflections some of which are flashbacks
of her flirting with tony irritated with anton angry with parnassus
to her reflections you little fool
youre to blame
i hate you
the multi reflection broken mirror corridor ends at two mirrors identical to the one used in the imaginarium
the one to the left is marked his with a bowler hat the other to the right hers with a bonnet
laughing madly so this is to be my choice
mr nick appears out of the his mirror a burst of flame behind him
he makes a sweeping gesture inviting valentina to enter the mirror marked hers
valentina heads for the mirror marked his
mr nick blocks her path
now theres absolutely no need for that
thats just plain contrariness
valentina tries to get around him
you think you deserve punishment but youre a kid you have no idea
valentina feints another direction
mr nick blocks her
a crazed look wrong
im a woman now
she spins around him
a kind of dance between them begins confusingly reflected in the mirrors
a tango can be heard
a selfish bitch everyone i love dies
only fit for hell
he looks at valentina with lascivious intent
hes tempted briefly but resists it
your pop would never speak to me again
and thatd be a shame
reflected in the swirling mirror fragments they tango until he spins her towards the right hand mirror
she sails through and with a mad smile throws him a kiss
the mirror closes with a burst of flame
the briefest flash of dr
parnassus face is reflected in the mirror fragments
mr nick turns realizing he has been looking into a mirror fragment reflecting the two mirrors
the writing on the valentinas mirror reads his
parnassus is sitting alone on a prominent bluff the same one he tried throwing himself off many years ago hes distraught
tears run down this cheeks
a distant bell tolls midnight
mr nick appears behind parnassus
sits down beside him
funny how things work out isnt it
he lights a cigarette
its not what i had in mind yknow
valentina being the fifth
it doesnt seem right
shes supposed to be the prize the star prize
not part of the bloody score
and you lumbered with eternal life all over again
what a bummer eh
no response from parnassus
a tarot cards drops from his hand
it is the hanged man
nick points to the plain far below
across the harsh ground tony is running for his life
pursued by the mob
i hope they get that bastard
tear him limb from limb
but they wont
he leads a charmed life that one
ive been trying to nail him for years
i thought i had him this time
but theres always some prat comes to his rescue
talk about the luck of the devil
he laughs those weird markings you found on him
on his forehead
those satanic symbol so called things
whats all that about
maybe they protect him in some way
ive never been into that black magic stuff myself
cant seem to get the hang of it
i know pathetic isnt it
parnassus ignores him sunk even deeper into despondency
god i hate to see you like this
look i tell you what
if you can get the lowdown on those satanic markings or
better still if you can wipe that self righteous little creep off the face of the universe
ill give you valentina back
slowly parnassus looks up
how about it
tony sweating panting for breath is running up the mountain
below the mob is still in hot pursuit
tony reaches the summit
in front of him is his salvation an empty gibbet
a noose hangs from the crossbeam
thank god for that
tony relaxes a little
we can hear the mob now struggling up the mountain
tony digs into one of his pockets and pulls out the brass tube that he has always kept close
tony opens his mouth and is about to slip the tube down his throat when he spots the hanged man tarot card lying at his feet
a hand from behind him snatches the tube away
tony startled turns to find himself looking up at dr
parnassus is standing on a chair with the noose around his neck
he smiles and opens his hand
the metal tube has vanished
the mob is getting closer
with his other hand dr
parnassus produces the tube from tonys ear
desperate give me that
parnassus gestures at the crowd
give us a moment please
the crowd goes into very slow motion
but twice as angry
parnassus teases tony with magic
heres your tube
producing a second tube but mines just a cheap counterfeit
look it breaks
he breaks it but heres another
youre not amused
desperate youve been talking to the devil havent you
let me guess what he said
if you manage to kill me hell release valentina
am i right
i am arent i
its all lies
he cant release her
and why not
because he doesnt have her
he cant have her because shes the prize
gaining confidence he doesnt have five wins
but if you kill me he will wont he
youll have lost valentina forever
parnassus does a double hand shuffle
this is ridiculous
youve got to believe me
for all our sakes
are you sure you made the right choice
lets find out
he slides the tube down his throat and kicks the chair away
dangles from the rope
the noose tight around his neck
at the same moment the mob resumes normal speed and roars up the mountain
is parnassus dead
working very fast tony hoists him over his shoulder and wrestles the noose loose
he drops parnassus on the ground
hes stunned but still alive
the mob is closing in
tony slaps dr
parnassus hard between the shoulder blades
the tube pops out of the doctors gullet
tony catches it
tony swallows the tube as the mob surge around the gibbet grabbing him beating him and then lifting him onto the chair tightening the noose around his neck
although battered tony winks smugly at dr
parnassus but his mood changes when he sees dr
parnassus spit out several more fake tubes then gagging force the real one up and out of his gullet
with a look of realization and horror tony drops to his death as the mob kicks the chair away from under him
the mob cheers
yes hes dead
parnassus tosses the metal tube to mr nick who steps coolly out of the mob cigarette in his mouth
hoarsely there are three cardinal rules
one theres no black magic only cheap tricks
i forget the others
now wheres my daughter
how should i know
youre her father
with needle her loving father
dr parnassus looks askance at mr nick
mr nick smiles and blows smoke in parnassuss face
the smoke fills the screen and becomes
a dust storm
the wind is howling
the swirling dust thins to reveal dr
parnassus alone exhausted trudging across a vast desert
hes tormented by his thoughts
what else could i do valentina
what else could i have done
what other choice could i have made
it was the right choice
of course it was
but where are you
wheres my beautiful daughter
wheres my darling
how long must i suffer
there is no proper road only endless sand but nevertheless dr
parnassus reaches a signpost which indicates two distinct paths
one leads to a tidy little suburban home the other up an dramatic mountain pass via a painfully steep staircase cut into the rock the same one that martin the
drunk chose not to climb days earlier
no no no
no more choices please
no more choices
enraged he tries to push the sign over but is too feeble
exhausted he subsides onto a smooth protruding stone
parnassus alarmed rolls quickly off the stone
now on his knees he finds himself looking at the top half of percys head and face
what hed thought was a stone was in fact his old companion buried in the sand
parnassus overjoyed begins to dig percy out
about bloody time
where have you been
how long have you been here
how longs a piece of string
dont ask daft questions
thank god i found you
i need your advice
indicating sign ive got a problematical choice to make
problematical my arse
i know its against the grain
percy grabs dr
parnassuss cloak and begins to pull him across the sand in the direction of the bungalow
we can now see the sign reads easy
on his dignity no
suburban bungalows and all that they evoke are anathema to me
ive got my pride
yeah it goes just before the fall
percy grabs dr
parnassuss cloak and begins to pull him across the sand in the direction indicated by the sign which we can now see reads easy
i know its against the grain
percy pulls the reluctant dr
parnassus up the drive of a suburban bungalow past a perfect lawn and double garage to the front door
percy rings the bell
parnassus tries to make a run for it but percy holds him fast
the door is opened by valentina
shes older and is carrying a baby in her arms
parnassus and valentina are astonished
neither knows what to say
recovering where have you been
all these years
i thought you were dead
so did i
valentina steps back and ushers her father in
aside so far so good
percy is about to follow but valentina focussing on her father closes the door in his face
valentina shows dr
parnassus into the sitting room
he sits on the sofa
can i have some ice cream
a small boy enters from the kitchen
billy this is your grandad
say hello to your grandad
to parnassus i think he looks a little like you
billy takes one look at dr
parnassus and runs back into the kitchen
hes only five
and hes very shy
would you like some tea
okay you look after imogen
she gives him the baby
shes eight months and so far fortunately doesnt look in the least like you
parnassus is moved
this is all i ever wanted
i know its not what you wanted for me but
there you go
he puts his arm around valentina
were both happy
parnassus doesnt know what to say
he sits there a ragged old man with a baby on his knee tears streaming down his face
little cut out cardboard figures are performing in a toy theatre
its your choice
you can stay here and look after mum and dad or come with me and help fight the giant
ill have to think about it
the camera pulls back to show percy manipulating the puppets and giving them voices
he and dr
parnassus are running a stall selling toy theatres
business is good
the audience is made up of mainly kids with some adults
commuters come and go
a couple of parents purchase a theatre for their son
parnassus takes the money and expertly wraps the theatre
itll last for years if properly looked after
does it come with a happy ending
im afraid we cant guarantee that
the camera angles across the table
in a shadowy corner stands mr nick smoking a cigarette
