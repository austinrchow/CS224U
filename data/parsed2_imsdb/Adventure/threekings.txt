russell story by john ridley and david o
russell draft date wide angle pov of wide open desert flat grey sky
the camera is running forward toward a big sand berm in the distance
there are o
sounds soldiers equipment clanking boots running on sand
hear a mans breathing
the back of his helmeted head and his uniformed shoulders appear in the bottom of the frame running
this is troy barlow sargeant u
army years old
on his helmet is a photo button with a photo of a newborn baby
suddenly on the sand berm meters ahead an iraqi soldier stands
troy stops in his tracks out of breath and stares at the figure on the berm
the iraqi flutters a white flag over his head then puts it down and picks up a gun
troy turns around we see his face for the first time
are we shooting people or what
are we shooting
thats what im asking you
whats the answer
i dont know the answer
thats what im trying to find out
pan to three soldiers yards away zoom in soldier unwraps a stick of gum and puts it into his mouth
two other soldiers put out their hands and get pieces of gum
pan to yards away zoom in soldier stands with his head tilted back while soldier looks into his eye
it looks like a grain of sand but i dont know how im gonna get it out captain van meter crab like is in the far distance
if they surrender dont shoot if they dont surrender then shoot
pan back to troy faces the camera close scared then turns back to the dune and runs a few yards
stops and stares raises his rifle
he aims at the figure on the horizon
the iraqi soldier in the cross hairs
hear troys breathing loud as he pulls trigger slowly
slow motion rifle sound
the iraqi soldier stands there then his neck explodes like a sack of blood
silent except for sound of troys loud breathing as he walks toward the big berm and up to the crest
all we hear are his footsteps and breathing
that guy just shot a towel head
lies on the ground
a piece of his neck is blown away
he is rasping a flag is clasped in one hand a rifle in the other
he is looking up at troy who looks down at him
a white baby girl covered in blood and placenta is pulled from between the legs of troys wife darlene
the nurse holds the screaming baby aloft proud and happy
deep southern accent congratulations you got yourself a rag head my man
the rasping iraqi dies
pan to conrad vig or wiry intense deep south wearing army issue glasses out of breath
troy turns upset murmurs i get around by the beach boys
gettin bugged drivin up and down the same old strip gotta find a new place where the kids are hip i get around i didnt think id see anyone get
shot over here
it looked like the guys head blew three feet into the air the iraqis head pops three feet into the air
bullshit thats not what happened
i said it looked like that happened but then we got here and he was still breathing
oh my god its just like predator where the guy the black guy carl weathers
his arm gets shot off
and when it hits the ground his hand keeps on firing
carl weathers arm is shot off and keeps firing

vig shoves the soldier away and the two wrestle as they roll down the sand berm
i just want to celebrate by rare earth comes on loud
troy walks away holding his temple in pain soldiers gather to stare at the dead iraqi getting their cameras out
dance on a road in the desert
i just want to celebrate blares as the camera dollies through the soldiers
dolly into tent town past bare chested soldiers pumping free weights jogging in formation sunbathing on big water storage mattresses dolly out of the tent town past a soldier taking
a makeshift foxhole desert bath past a dead iraqi on the road a chopper hovering in the distance to more dancing soldiers as music continues spirits are high and the music is boisterous as these young troops celebrate shit
let me try that again
dolly around the dancing soldiers to see hundreds of stripped iraqi soldiers lying face down in undershorts
spirits are high and the music is fucking motherfucking sand in my eye pan past cnn reporter bill smithson in white safari jacket over desert storm fatigues cleaning his eye
nearby a cluster of rowdy soldiers who are mugging into the camera
dolly to archie gates lieutenant colonel special forces wearing sunglasses talking to havichon a french special forces captain on crutches with a broken leg

beer is sputtered from soldiers mouths
i cant do nothing for ya man by public enemy blasts
walter wogoman quiet tall southern operates two parallel boom boxes like a dj
a soldier rapidly peels down one bruce lee poster on top of another like a flip book animating bruce lee
vig wearing a bandage across his nose from the fight on the berm does a series of cheerleader like karate arm movements
soldiers whip brightly painted toy footballs at troy
he whips the balls back is tackled over a table crashes
soldiers vig walter others scream viscerally as the music blasts
two soldiers fire their fingers like pistols at troy on the floor screaming like a fierce animal
vig screams into troys face at point blank range
goddamn it where the fuck did this beer come from we gotta take more iraqis prisoner tomorrow
wide shot hundreds of iraqis walking in the desert hands raised above their heads
hasnala shi aluno quibaan we will not hurt you
lay down your weapons get on the ground two iraqis with bad face wounds get medical help
on their knees plead for mercy in arabic as they disrobe
they grab and kiss troy barlows hand as he holds his m on the begging iraqis
its cool no ones gonna hurt you vig whips out his big thunder pistol and points it in their faces
did you rape and torture anybody in kuwait abdul
the iraqis wail for mercy
troy pushes vigs pistol away
youre making them all hysterical
vig points the big pistol at an older iraqi officer who is the only one not taking his clothes off
take your fucking rags off take this off
no comprende english motherfucker
what is your fucking problem conrad
im trying to git him to obey the spirit of things but he wont take his rags off
leans down sir
we need you to disrobe like all the other towel heads ok
the officer does not move troy punches his head once
vig and walter forcibly pull the iraqi officers pants off
troy takes out a bottle of aspirin eats two
whoa its a freaky thing troy
vig points to the officers bare buttocks where a rolled up piece of paper is sticking out theres a document in that guys ass conrad
thats the freaky thing
do you think he ate it
it wouldnt come out perfect like that if he ate it
troy pulls out a latex glove out of his pocket
go get it private
hasa man timal
the officer screams in protest and is forcibly subdued by walter as vig wearing the glove slowly pulls the rolled up greasy paper from the officers ass troy looks disgusted
open it up
you only gave me one glove
im sorry i dont have another but you gotta open it up
thats how the chain of command works
vig takes out a u
army pen and uses it to unroll the greasy paper and lie it flat on the sand
is a handwritten map with scant arabic writing a few spare roads numbers and three small boxes
what the hell is that
important enough to squeeze your cheeks for
in the half light of dozens of tv monitors playing iraqi news from around the world archie gates madly humps cathy daitch on a lawn chair which is slamming into
you are a trained warrior trained warrior trained warrior jesus christ colonel
tv monitors crash to the floor as she climaxes
archie lays on the floor catching his breath stares at a sideways monitor of soldiers celebrating she stands dresses
breathless whats bill got
just the celebration story
thats it how about you
did you find anything
it could be another bullshit lead but i need you to help me find a guy who might have something on the gold whos the guy
somebody barlow maybe in company barlow
got a map out of a prisoners head
out of a prisoners head
or his ear or his ass or his dick and they got like a fifty page full color mini atlas of saddams bunkers out of a guys dick
the door explodes open and two mps grab archie pants around his ankles and drag him from the truck
archie is faced by an older two star general general pye a younger one star general general horn
this is not the way we service the media major
stop her whip pan to cathy runs away as she dresses mps grab her
you are in violation of code d grinding major gates
they let her go
soldiers in gas suits laugh
you guys have no manners whatsoever bill smithson runs up agitated
i told you he was with her were handling this ok
the mp pushes smithson away
i wanted help with the gold story and he took off on me thats a lot of bullshit
smithson is walked away
archie pulls his pants up
i give you a prestige job in the media war of the century and the guy feels neglected
im helping him plenty with his big celebration feature where did you get this fucking star
archie suddenly reaches out and grabs the corner of general horns collar with its one star
they made me a general pal
i dont even know what we did over here but schwartzkopf gets a book deal you get a star powell gets to be fucking president are you high
this is a huge win for us
running the press pools a real big win for me
you want us to kill more americans to occupy iraq
im just saying its ironic thats all
what the fuck is ironic
we got the biggest army in the world here but iraq still has the d bag dictator in power but thats how the world works i guess
just take care of smithson and maybe hell hook you up to consult on movies
its either that or be a security guard when you retire
fuck you ron
im a general now you cant say fuck you to me
ok sir but theres another thing id like to say if you dont mind
go right ahead colonel
archie leans wild eyed into horns face and whispers fuuuuuck yooouuuu ronnnnn
splash rubbing alcohol is poured over vigs extended hand by doc elgin stocky black no nonsense
youve washed your hands like a thousand times conrad
lord knows what vermin live in the butt of a dune koon
why do you let this cracker follow you around
hes a good kid
hes a wall eyed cracker
hes got no high school man hes from a group home in jackson i dont give a shit if hes from johannesburg
i dont want to hear dune koon or sand nigger from him or anybody
captain uses those terms
the point is conrad towel head and camel jockey are perfectly good substitutes
im sorry man its a little confusing is all
what can i do for your headache
doc elgin opens a case full of pill bottles
got any vicadan
how about caffergot
lets translate my iraqi ass map
troy pops the pills doc pulls a document from a folder and opens it as he hovers over a table with troy and vig
van meters at the big pow wow
were cool for at least three hours but keep walter on the door
walter stands by the door wearing night vision goggles
would you take those fucking things off
i never got to use night vision
they dont work during the day and stand outside the tent
doc unfolds a big aerial photo map of the iraqi desert next to the rumpled ass map
these are definitely saddams bunkers near karbala
according to intelligence picasso armani rolex mercedes sony you name it kuwait was muslim beverly hills and saddam sacked it
man get an awesome stereo system with like ten bos speakers silver lexus convertible
lexus doesnt make a convertible
yes they do
infiniti has one coming
you cant get a car home from here anyway
if i get enough rolexes i could buy one when i got home
one gold rolex i get a very fine split level outside jackson
my one problem see is the risk here what risk
we already did the risk
i signed up last year to bank some computer training tell me about it
next thing i know im sitting here waiting to get hit by a scud
i put my life on the line for what purpose im not sure and now the good lord puts this map in my path he could put a land mine
in your path if we try to find this place youre safe with me
cuz you have a galactic plutonium forcefield
i dont talk about it
but i do have a ring of jesus fire
you have a ring of jesus fire
i was fire baptized
i was baptized in water
im fire baptized
i dont even know what water baptism means
for those who understand no explanation is necessary for those who dont no explanation will suffice
you can benefit from my jesus ring if you do right by me you got that
blurry image of archie walking right up to walter
this tent is restricted get the fuck out of my way
may day may day troy and doc scramble to put the maps under the table
he walks up to them
would this be the proctology tent
yes sir i mean no sir
then maybe its the urology tent
captains at a staff meeting
thats ok im not looking for a proctologist or a urologist im looking for sargeant barlow
archie fixes his gaze on troy walks up reaches under the table and takes the map smells his fingers
youre on the path to truth when you smell shit isnt that what they say
i dont recognize you sir
are you in this division
hes not in this division
hes special forces
troy and vig are impressed
hes the guy taking bill smithson around
and you would be the three wise men right mappy slappy and pappy he points in order to doc vig and troy who picks up his family photo button
that leaves cappy outside
walter outside the tent practices blocking positions
do not pass
hold it freeze
his name is walter
did you good soldiers present this map to captain van meter
then ill take it to him
troy stands and grabs the map
well take it to him
it wont do either of us any good then will it
hes our commander sir
wed have to tell him you took it
both troy and archie hold the map staring at each other
everyone is tense
it could be nothing but a sandy love letter from one eye raqi to another its a series of bunkers near karbala
not maybe definitely
recon photos match the map
may i look at the goddamn map
troy lets go
archie holds the map up to the light
he then pours some of docs rubbing alcohol on the map and holds it to the light again
he puts the map on the table turns the light off and clicks on an infra red flashlight he pulls out
a completely different map appears in green markings
thats what makes rangers badass we get the best flashlights
they stare at the new map in the infrared glow captivated
still looks like a series of three bunkers in three villages
a bit farther to the west
seventy five klicks north
much closer to karbala
leave at dawn back by lunch not a big deal
of course he turns the overhead light back on
there could be nothing inside but starving arabs and stolen watches but i think its worth checking out even if i have to do it with clueless reservists like you
they look at him
i mean i could take the map but you could talk it starts to become a pain in the ass for me so well do the gold together
you dont even know whats inside these bunkers do you
rolexes are swell but im talking about kuwaiti bullion
you mean the little cubes you put in hot water for soup
not the little cubes you put in hot water for soup
kilos each in todays market
for one gold brick
im sure mr
hussein has divided his bricks
into many different hiding places but just one hiding place should be easy to take and that would be enough to get us out of our day jobs
unless the three kings are in love with their day jobs
dolly troy doc vig stare at archie
silent troy walks in white shirtsleeves dark tie pulling a cart with a salesmans black case on it over a curb
silent troy kneels at a disassembled photocopier tools and parts all around him opens a bag of toner which spills black dust all over his white shirt silent doc is
a red cap
he lifts suitcases from the trunk of a black mercedes while a rich white father mother and two small children behind tells him to be careful
vig fires his pistols with fury at a series of stuffed animals on logs blowing the stuffed animals to smithereens
i dont really have a day job
what about the risk of taking a humvee and all that we do this shit all the time
what else did you do sir
in panama we went sailing in noriegas boats
in vietnam we got a big gold buddha which we unfortunately dropped in a swamp by accident
what about iraqi soldiers
they had the shit bombed out them for two months theyre deserting all over the place and theyve completely surrendered to us
thats a beaten army in every sense of the word
he looks at them
you are now under my command salute they salute him
he straightens troys salute
whats the guys name outside
cappy walter comes in
you will take bill smithson on a special mission to find the gold story but it will be a meaningless ride that lasts all morning and takes him nowhere near
karbala is that clear
how am i gonna get out of the company
your captain will be detained by a friend of mine
is it true you got to take an enemy ear to be special forces
no but if you talk to anybody about this ill kill you
vig smile fades as he looks into archies cold stare
three figures in fatigues crouch low to the ground as they run to a motorcycle and side car
walter kickstarts the motorcycle
paco the cameraman sits behind walter with a video camera
walters face is painted beige and brown with camouflage spots so is bill smithsons as he crouches in the sidecar and dramatically gives walter the thumbs up
cathy daitch stands next to a cameraman filming van meter while another man holds a boom over van meters head
how about if i lean on it like this
does it look too posed
would you ever stand like that
van meter tries a couple of poses
i think i might jesus this feels stupid
youll get used to it
first question did you dream as a boy youd be commanding an infantry company in a desert war
as a boy i wanted to be either a veterinarian or a cia sharpshooter bachs gloria from mass in b minor plays as pow pow pow vig fires his big
pistol into the desert
troy throws a painted football into the desert
doc fires the m and blows the ball to pieces
archie drives and moves his hand to the bach
the convertible humvee is loaded with weaponry and gear a mounted mm machine gun a bart simpson doll on the grill
the humvee rolls into the vast desert littered with burned out tanks black craters overturned vehicles no people
troy throws another ball doc blows it away
doc throws a football from the moving humvee troy fires a pistol and misses the ball as it bounces to the desert
i gave you a better arc doc
what are you talking about
i threw the ball in a higher arc that was easier for you to hit
blacks make better receivers than quarterbacks
stop speaking right now conrad
warren moon is an excellent quarterback
the oilers have gone nowhere behind warren moon
dont get down in the mud with him doc
the eagles will never get to the superbowl with him
archie moves his hand to the bach
doug williams took the redskins to the superbowl and won ok
we can all agree there are many excellent black quarterbacks
doc throws a ball
vig fires his giant pistol twice and misses
hit it you sorry assed cracker this guns too heavy to shoot one handed like a movie star vig fires blam blam bam
the humvee stops abruptly
shut the fuck up
they sit in embarrassed silence the joyous bach choir plays
no more music
troy doc and vig stand spread apart
they wear white anti gas suits and hold pistols and drink from plastic water bottles
a bomb crater is nearby a wrecked burned truck to the side a skinny cow meanders
when we pull up to the bunker the approach is something called violence of action which is standard in special operations
it means your movement is so fast and decisive that the guards are frozen and we havent fired a single shot
troy kicks at something in the sand and a decayed human arm springs out attached to a body with a half rotted face
we dropped a lot of bombs out here and we buried some guys alive what do you mean
bradleys with big plows cut through the berms and covered the trenches on the front of a bradley pushes sand right toward the camera they had the option to surrender
but they chose to die for their country
dolly into five terrified iraqis eyes open with fear as the sand rolls over them
they sit in the humvee and hold their pistols ready
well say the cow is the primary guard outside the bunker
we pull up fast and stop short
the cow stares as the humvee pulls up to it fast
troy and doc jump out pistols drawn flank the cow the cow steps back and explodes
troy and doc stand splattered with cow entrails
the cows head lands with a thud on the hood of the humvee
its all cow i think
yeah its all cow
he picks cow entrails off himself
they said this was swept for mines
mines are forever doc
they never get all of em
low murmur if you could help me rhonda help help me rhonda archie watches troy
did you guys see any action at all
only night bombing on cnn except for troys supercool shooting that guy in the neck archie takes vigs big pistol and empties the shells and puts them into his pocket
is sepsis cool
infection of the blood
as in septic tank because thats what happens when a bullet hits you
the lead tears in there slow motion a bullet pierces flesh makes a cavity makes a cavity of dead tissue that closes down in a convulsive motion typical of all
the cavity fills up with bile and bacteria and youre fucked
bile fluid fills the cavity
but other than a wound that blinds paralyzes or castrates the worst wound ive ever seen is something called tension pneumo thorax i heard something about that tension pneumo what
a bullet or a blade doesnt kill you but makes a little hole in the lung so every time you breathe a little air leaks into the chest cavity which
starts to fill up like a balloon
and that balloon starts to push your organs to the side crushing your lung your liver your heart
your own breathing kills you one breath at a time kinda like a job you cant stand or a bad lie you once told
thats not fatal they can stop it
if you know how to make another little hole in the chest to let the air out just like you would with an overinflated tire
they look at archie scared by this
can we play the beach boys when we go in
the goddamn beach boys
im not ashamed of liking the beach boys
it calms me down
better than mozart
i get around by the beach boys blasts as the humvee speeds along
a big american flag flaps in the breeze from a pole at the back of the hummer
the humvee drives fast into the central square of a small village of low sand colored stucco buildings and shanties
vig drives as the humvee speeds around the town square zooming past scared shiites in black robes a few skinny dogs a few bewildered iraqi soldiers
wheres the bunker
it should be right he studies the map and points to a decayed green building
vig jerks the wheel right
they drive fast
archie points left
vig jerks the wheel left drives straight toward a low cement building with two iraqi soldiers in front
iraqi soldiers look scared as the humvee drives up like its going to hit them and stops flag fluttering in the breeze
vig stands and speaks into a megaphone
we are the army of the united states of america
we are here to protect you
troy and doc leap from the humvee with pistols drawn and their free hands held up in a halt sign
the two iraqi guards look stunned as troy and doc simply take their machine guns and put the iraqis face down on the ground
troy and doc pull out plastic twist hand cuffs as used in urban riots
archie bounds forward holding up a thick white document
orders from president bush step aside
troy finishes handcuffing one of the iraqi soldiers as a gaunt mother with a baby in her arms opens her blouse revealing her small breasts
other peasants gather
troy looks shocked until archie suddenly pushes him past the iraqi mother and to the door of the bunker which doc holds
five iraqi soldiers look disoriented and scared as they hold their hands up in the air
do not panic
step outside into the megaphone we are here for your protection and safety
iraqi women and children kiss vigs feet
the five iraqi soldiers exit the bunker with their hands raised and the starved shiite civilians spit and throw stones at them while i get around keeps playing
yall be cool now this is the u
marines in charge here
archie runs down the narrow stairs of the bunker followed by troy and doc
doc lashes an iraqis hands behind his back and cuffs him
troy shoots the door lock with his pistol
then backs up and gives it a running shoulder
the door doesnt budge
he holds his shoulder in pain
archie kicks the door repeatedly
troy joins him it finally flies open
troy is embraced by an iraqi soldier about
i am love united states of freedom
i am hate saddam
troy tries some karate moves jerking his elbows to dislodge the iraqi from the bear hug ya ya ha doc points his pistol in the iraqis face
let him go
the iraqi throws his hands in the air
no problem my friend
archie goes to a series of wooden crates the size of file cabinets where doc helps archie take off his back pack
archie pulls out a bolt cutter and a pneumatic saw both attached to a small air tank and opens the crate which is filled with hundreds of kuwaiti passports
you look for the chemical weapon
we look for the gold
they use the power tools to open the second crate also filled with hundreds of passports
wheres the gold
they move the gold
archie pulls out the infrared map and shows it to the iraqi who says nothing
kill him now
they point their guns
its a show
archie holds the map
points to map this bunker
ill take you
four new iraqi soldiers armed with rifles run from the far side of the square and start shooting
rock throwing shiite scatter at the gunfire
two men fall to the ground as they are shot
vig looks terrified as the crowd scatters leaving him alone as he points his big unloaded pistol
the soldiers point their rifles as they come towards vig when suddenly two of them look to the side and shout
pan to a shiny metal tanker truck three hundred yards out bearing down fast on the village square
the soldiers open fire on the truck
the shiite riding shotgun fires back as the windshield shatters on the truck
the driver is dead
the other shiite grabs the wheel
archie bursts out the front door followed by troy and doc
they freeze as the tanker truck careens sideways toward them feet away
an iraqi soldier fires a grenade launcher off his shoulder which explodes the container on the back of the truck milk explodes everywhere gushing around the wheels of the humvee
and the feet of archie and the others
shiite women with plastic containers and ceramic jugs rush out from alleys and try to scoop up the milk
other shiites crowd the humvee and climb in
iraqi soldiers drag two bodies from the cab of the truck
troy and doc point their guns in the crowd
out of the way
archie shoves shiite peasants out of the humvee
she holds a shirtless boy of with a bandage around his entire chest
doc pushes her off the humvee
he grabs archie
troy shoves the man off the vehicle
vig starts the engine
give them mres
troy rips open a large duffel and starts handing out army meal rations to the crowd vig leans on the horn
the friendly iraqi jumps into the rear of the hummer as it starts to pull away
archie shoves the friendly iraqi out and he lands on his ass in the swarm of chasing shiites
archie and troy look back at the debacle as they pull away
raging oil fires feet high billowing black smoke
walter drives the motorcycle through the smoke
paco the cameraman sits on back
bill smithson sits in the sidecar
this is boring i already did this damn story goddamn it where the hell is the gold
how about rare pelican migration out by the marshes
these brave pelicans are migrating in spite of massive pollution fuck that
stop the bike
walter keeps driving
doc gets out of the stopped humvee shaken and walks around
im all right im cool
he lies down and breathes heavily with a hand on his chest
archie gets out and walks around agitated clearly upset
what is the art of war because it is not for killing people its a stratagem to give life to many by killing the evil perpetrated by a few i
am burning up in this goddamn suit he angrily takes off his gas suit boxers and sweat drenched green t shirt underneath
troy and vig guzzle water
discriminating use of violence as a last resort and even then carefully surgically thats what i learned thats what im good at
but now they underestimate all this bomb the same towns for six weeks and still leave the scumbag dictator to starve and butcher his own people
the others all drenched in sweat take off their gas suits
agitated i dont even know what happened back there
civilians were spitting on their own soldiers the soldiers were shooting the civilians and ignoring us they already surrendered to us
now theyre after shiites
what exactly is a shiite
they make up the ethnic majority but they dont have any power
when bush pulled us out he told them to start a civil war to bring saddam down and now theyre getting wasted
totally puzzled the civil war
how could it be the civil war
vig looks puzzled
its a war inside the same country conrad
thats a civil war
archie chucks each of them marine uniforms without name tags which everyone puts on except troy
put these on we are now u
i cant do this ok
because ive got a family and if i shit in a bag the rest of my life cuz i got shot after the wars already over that would be pretty
fucking stupid wouldnt it
what is the most important thing in life
what the fuck are you talking about
what is it
did you hear anything i said
respect is the most important
too dependent on other people
comes and goes man
what is this bullshit
whats the most important thing
thats what dictates what will happen at any given time in life
necessity says we dont spend american lives taking out saddam which leaves saddam the necessity of taking out the shiites so he can stay in power which leaves us to
take the gold
we couldve been shot
did you notice they didnt touch us
we decimated their entire country
theyre scared shitless of us
looks at his watch theres time to try another bunker
i say we go
lets do it
rock and roll
and ill be wearing fashionable kevlar
as a necessity
he pulls a vest out of the humvee
the motorcycle is stopped by the marsh
siberian pelicans fly all around
many lie dead on the ground
bill smithson paces with a cell phone
on cell phone im at some goddamn marsh all weve seen are russian cranes
on the cell phone i think the saddam story goes more for the jugular journalistically speaking al
lets grow some balls and do the shiite uprising for christs sake
bill smithson closes the cell phone
were going north to do the shiites
i thought the gold was the hot spot
karbalas the new hotspot and im driving
military regulations you cannot drive
smithson mounts the bike
the cameraman sits on back
walter points his pistol at smithson
get off the vehicle sir
smithson starts the bike
dont make me shoot you sir

troy displays the gunshot in the kevlar
what if this was you not wearing kevlar
suddenly the sound of an approaching tank
a tank rolls toward them fast down a narrow side street followed by a truck with a rocket launcher
great a fucking tank

grenade launcher sir
vig struggles to lift the grenade launcher
lets get out of here
its about fucking time
troy jumps into the luggage packed truck starts the engine
vig starts the humvee archie jumps in next to vig
pan to the eight shiites plus the man in glasses and the little girl jam into the crowded humvee
doc jumps in
the tank approaches
the humvee pulls away
the tank rolls in from the side but the tank turret whines and clicks stuck in place
an iraqi pops out the top of the tank
he gestures to the whining stuck turret
another iraqi tries pushing the turret
the truck with the small rocket launcher pulls up
as it bounces along fast
archie is in pain while doc pours disinfectant over archies gunshot wound in his lower left arm and wraps it
vig looks terrified as he drives
troy driving alone speeds the truck as fast as it will go bouncing along the road
we were home free you stupid son of a bitch
the truck is yards behind the humvee whats the tank doing
through docs jiggling binoculars of the tank turning
lining us up vig pushes the humvees accelerator to the floor
the shiite man in glasses and his little girl cling to the humvee as they sit on top of the vuitton hat cases with eight other shiites including two five
year olds a boy and girl
two iraqi soldiers take a thin rocket four feet long and load a clear plastic canister of brown fluid into it
a gunshot rings out a soldier is hit in the arm
whip pan to a shiite boy with an old rifle in the third floor window of a small stone building
iraqis shout and point at the sniper
the tank turns to the building
the humvee drives fast over the bumpy two lane road
the tank fires a round at the building which collapses
a shiite mother father and two children pray at a crude table when the ceiling collapses
the iraqi soldiers fire the rocket launcher
vig turns the speeding humvee off the road
archie jerks the wheel back

i dont wanna get hit
slow motion doc looks straight up with the binoculars
slow motion a rocket streaks a squiggly white line of smoke across the sky
rear of humvee slow motion half the shiites hunch down bracing for an explosion while the other half crane their necks looking straight up into the sky
they cower when there is an explosion above
pan up to regular speed the rocket explodes in the sky a hundred yards above the humvee into a brown cloud
troy leans out the window of the moving truck and squints up at the brown gas cloud above as he drives fast
archie and doc grapple to put on their gas masks
vig reaches around behind him for his mask as he drives
wheres my mask
he accidentally veers off the road into the open desert
zoom in to a field of mines sitting right on top of the sand yards ahead
iraqi mines were often placed this way zoom in on archies alarmed face mine
archie dives from the humvee followed by vig doc the man in glasses holding the little girl the other shiites including the two five year olds
the hummer drives ten yards hits the first mine with an explosion and flies into the air flying debris smashes the windshield
troy instinctively jerks the wheel and the truck flips onto its side and slides across the sand
the airborne humvee lands on its side hits another mine is blown into the air lands on its back and is blown to pieces
troy sits sideways as the truck slides across the sand to a halt inches before a mine yards behind the wrecked humvee
a wheel on the wrecked humvee spin in the air squeaking
louis vuitton suitcases are scattered all over
one has opened and the gold bars are spilled around
shiites stagger to their feet some cut and bleeding some limping
they cover their faces with their clothes as the dense brown fog descends around them
vigs right eye has taken shrapnel and is bloody mess he gropes in the sand for his glasses as blood drips down
archie puts his gas mask on the little girl with arm casts
doc takes his mask off when he sees what archie has done and gives it to the shiite man in glasses
doc picks up vigs glasses and hands them to vig who stands blinking his one good eye while blood streams down his face
cover your face conrad

vig is in shock
doc lifts vigs bloody hand to vigs mouth
unseen in the fog troy climbs out of the overturned truck

face with her coat
as he runs between land mines after the boy who is way ahead

i cant even see the truck
about five shiites wander around confused
archie spins around drops the bag and points his pistol
two black robed figures pick up vuitton hat cases
a black robed figure walks right past archie takes a scared shiite man by the arm and leads him to the side

vig starts crying
doc hands a bandage to archie who puts it over vigs wounded eye socket

archie climbs out of a small mound in the desert squints in the light and looks around
a strange minaret stretches skyward from the flat desert yards away
the minaret is made of yellow stone it twists feet into the air like a twisting wedding cake
archie leads the others toward the minaret
no one is around except for a few black robes
archie doc and vig enter the old wooden doorway of the ancient minaret
a line of ten children with missing limbs and bandages stand and watch archie doc and vig enter
they make eye contact
close up the hands of an iraqi soldier carefully wrap a bare wire around troys right ear

the interrogator signals someone o
and suddenly voltage races through the wire causing troy to gnash his teeth together so hard they chip
he writhes in pain
in subtitles that seemed like too much volts
you got to build it up slow
a second iraqi gestures defensively at a console that is connected to the wire around troys jaw
a third iraqi reaches forward and turns a dial
the second iraqi murmurs defensively and turns the dial back

the interrogator turns back to troy

he looks at doc as if to say great
archies arm is in pain as he carefully wraps a thin layer of light blue plastic explosive around a football presses small nails sideways into the plastique and inserts a
fuse in the end of the ball
another ball bomb just like it has already been constructed

high wide shot a lone iraqi military truck mint condition
archie vig and doc form a semicircle surrounding the truck
they are all yards back from the truck
this is the united states army
come out of the truck with your weapons in the air
suddenly vigs pistol fires
his gunshot blows a hole in the iraqi truck which deflates like a huge beach ball circling wildly until it lies in a heap of collapsed camouflage canvass while yards
away shiites flip sand colored blankets off and stand up in the desert to look
doc lifts the limp canvass of the deflated truck
they used a lot of decoys to throw off our bombers
where are we gonna get a vehicle
i know a place thats full of deserters

high wide shot they walk in a single file line in the desert
archie in front carries a vuitton bag
archie now walks among shiites toting old rifles
there are bomb craters destroyed cars a few mud dwellings nearby

shiites cheer and pat archie doc and vig on the back as they walk to a bunker built into the side of a small hill
two iraqi soldiers come out smiling to embrace a disoriented archie and doc
they pass through a cluttered room with six cots down a hallway to a larger room where two more young iraqi soldiers sit watching cnn
there is a defaced poster of saddam two peacocks and three monkeys in the room and the half eaten carcass of a zebra
the soldiers rise and half bow to archie

the other iraqis nod their heads and laugh nervously

archie doc vig stare in amazement its an underground garage filled with nine luxury cars a rolls royce a jaguar a mercedes an infiniti convertible four cadillacs a white stretch
the friendly iraqi smiles
doc stops at the convertible

the iraqi deserters look at him

the iraqi laughs

they raise their joined hands together
george bush wants you to stand up for yourself

iraqis burst into cheers

doc slams in a cd traditional iraqi folk wailing plays
the shiite riflemen in back smile as vig scowls
imam sits in passenger seat with his daughter on his lap
they listen to iraqi music
shiites finish passing vuitton suitcases into a trench
the bags are buried
archie drives a stake to mark the spot
we get our man we come back to pick up the gold and my people
my gold isnt here and i mean all of it your people will not survive
doc and vig pull off distributor caps from the cadillacs and limousine but not the jaguar and put them in docs pack
lets load and go
imam hugs and kisses his daughter goodbye and tries to put her crying into the arms of an older woman
wait a second i want to talk about this plan some more were going to drive in and get troy exactly like we discussed
i have a bad feeling like were gonna get wasted
its good to be scared when theres guns around
vig looks uneasy
archie hums bachs gloria and moves a hand in the air then puts his hands on vigs shoulders and sings the bach loud
vig eventually joins in the chorus
im all right
he lies down and breathes with a hand on his chest as archie and vig keep singing
bachs b minor mass plays as the mercedes infiniti and rolls royce drive across the desert
the interrogator finishes putting tissue in troys bleeding nose
your son wouldnt be dead if saddam didnt invade kuwait
smash the windows of a benneton store then a cartier store
i heard about some bad shit that happened there
drag patients from their hospital beds and an iraqi soldier dives on top of a crying nurse and starts to rape her while a baby is taken from an incubator
which is stolen
whos got the sick country
maybe saddam is very crazy right
and then you are crazy to bomb all of iraq
too much bombing is crazy but not saving kuwait

the second iraqi dips a bucket into an oil drum

it makes the world crazy
you got to keep it stable

the interrogator pulls a cd from troys pocket and jams it into troys mouth
this is your fahking stability my main man
the interrogator uses the cd as a funnel to force feed the crude oil into troys mouth as he pours it from the bucket
archie doc vig stand on a sand ridge and look down on the oasis bunker in the distance
behind them are the three cars imam and a handful of shiite gunmen
they get into the cars
an empty ridge
the infiniti rolls mercedes shoot over it arcing down toward the bunker engines roaring
it is quiet
a slim jim is unwrapped as an iraqi guard slowly raises it to his mouth bites it chews and looks puzzled at the cars approaching in the distance
high wide shot looking straight down
the cars drive three abreast down the approach road to the bunker
the infiniti is in the middle flanked by the rolls on the left and the mercedes on the right
vig looks scared as he drives the infiniti straight toward the bunker
a shiite sits up front with him
fifty yards from the bunker vig turns sharply and drives in circles
two iraqi guards one chewing a slim jim look bewildered as they stare at the circling infiniti fifty yards away
archie with imam in the passenger seat two shiites in back speeds the mercedes past the guards around the right side to the back side of the bunker skidding across
the mercedes and the rolls diverge around the bunker on either side rolls on the left mercedes on the right
doc drives the rolls around the left to the bunkers rear
iraqi soldiers fire a grenade that blows up right behind the rolls as doc skids right up to a rear entrance of the bunker the grill touching the metal door
doc parks blockading the rear door shut and with three shiite riflemen jumps out
a shiite helps vig wedge a piece of wood onto the gas pedal
vig suddenly grabs his hand in pain
the shiite looks at him
vig and the shiite bail out of the moving infiniti
wads of plastic explosive are taped to the grill of the car as it speeds towards the bunker then drifts to the side go straight go straight he jumps up
and down and points but the infiniti goes far to the side of the bunker and explodes into some ruins
the two guards point their guns at vig and the shiite and they run into the desert as bullets pop around them
archie skids the mercedes to a halt on the right side of the bunker jumps out slams the door followed by imam and the two other shiites
they run toward the bunker archie with a wad of plastic explosive and nails in one hand and a cigarette lighter in the other
he hears the chirp of a car alarm being activated as he runs to the bunker
imam finds a vent hole on the low facade of the bunker pulls off a grill
archie lights a fuse sticking out of the plastic explosive and drops it into the vent
troy gags and spits his front is covered in oil
the interrogator raises the bucket
are you feeling stable enough for more
an explosion elsewhere in the bunker causes the lights to flicker out
iraqi soldiers scurry in the darkness with flashlights
they go to the rear door pile up in the dark pushing
the parked rolls royce blockades the rear door
archie and imam run back to the mercedes but the car is locked his pistol sits inside on the front seat
a gunshot from the bunker roof shatters the window of the mercedes setting off the car alarm
archie reaches in grabs his pistol and bolts as a launched grenade blows the mercedes
iraqi soldiers pour out of the smoking bunker as shiite riflemen with doc fire on them
two iraqis go down with only the sound of bullets piercing their flesh
iraqis run for it into the desert
iraqis throw their hands up in surrender while look ambivalent one holds stack of new levis
doc raises a hand to stop his shiite gunmen from firing but they fire anyway and iraqis fire back the shiite next to doc is hit in the face
stop shooting whats the matter with you
he reaches out and holds the rifle of a shiite
everyone stops firing slowly the iraqis drop their guns
doc has wet archie runs up from the right grabs docs arm and they run past surrendering iraqi soldiers and into the front entrance
of the bunker
imam takes cover on the side of the bunker while shiites and iraqis aim at each other
vig approaches cautiously from the desert hears an aircraft and looks up
an iraqi helicopter comes in fast and opens fire with machine guns shit
vig runs toward the bunker for cover but is cut off by machine gun fire from the chopper
shiites fire rifles up at the chopper
chips of metal and plastic fly off as bullets hit the chopper
arabic chatter is heard over a crackling radio
feet below vig and six remaining shiite riflemen are running into the desert away from the chopper
vig and the six shiites frantically search for cover
the chopper fires and one of the shiites running with vig is hit in the head thrown by the force of the gunshot into vig who goes down faking it
vig lies face down out of breath with the dead shiite on top of him while the chopper hovers above
jesus god i dont wanna get hit please jesus watch over me it is dimly lighted by a few mounted emergency lights
archie and doc run down the empty stairs through the big main room it is empty
archie goes down the right side kicks open a door its the bathroom full of stolen stuff and cell phones doc goes down the left side of the room kicks
in a door a room full of benneton sweaters in all colors
archie kicks in a door a room with shelves full of large snow globes thousands of them
doc kicks in a door a room cluttered with debris but there is another door at the far side of the room
he approaches and kicks it repeatedly without success
archie kicks in a door it is pitch black an emergency light flickers on and off revealing the two iraqi torturers at the control table where one tries to fix
the emergency light with a screwdriver in flickering light archie shoots one iraqi guard squarely in the chest then the other the only sound is the gun popping and the bullets tearing into their bodies
archie turns to the interrogator who stands next to troy
its ok buddy we are just talking now slightly slow motion archie shoots the interrogator in the thigh
the only sound is gun shooting flesh tearing blood thinly splatters across troys face as the interrogator grimaces and falls to the floor
the light flicks on a few beats then off a few beats
archie rips the wires from the table controls goes to troy unhinges the wire from his jaw
the interrogator writhes in pain on the ground
archie takes the interrogators pistol snaps open a knife cuts the cord binding troy to the chair and gives troy the pistol
troy sits stained with oil blood tears
he gets up looks down at the interrogator on the floor points the pistol into the interrogators face
the interrogator stares at troy who stares back
archie watches out of breath
troy fires the gun just to the side of the interrogators face into the ground
the interrogator looks terrified crying
troy stares back looks unhappy lowers the gun
troy and archie look at each other for an intense moment
doc shoots the lock on the inner door and it finally opens
he looks inside and sees in a sunken room more shiite civilians huddled together
archie rushes by with troy
archie and troy run out of the bunker the chopper hovers right there
it fires a grenade which explodes next to archie and troy
they scramble back into the bunker
archie and troy run into doc at the door knocking him over
they crouch inside the door the chopper hovers low outside
vig gropes the sand for his glasses crawling on his hands and knees with the dead shiite on his back
you gotta be my disguise mr
shiite cuz they need my help over there the six iraqis who took oft from the bunker are still running
their conversation is in arabic and subtitled in lets go back and get them
fuck a donkey no way
theres a chopper we can do it
he and another iraqi stop while the other two keep running
they killed your families you fucking cowards
the tough iraqi and his partner sweating profusely out of breath split up and head back toward the bunker
archies in great pain
he grimaces as he tightens the bandage around his forearm
troy is shaking uncontrollably
doc grabs troys shoulders firmly

archie pulls one of the football bombs wrapped in c from his small pack and hands it to doc
archie pretends to throw with nothing in his hand
step throw one two im gonna give it a five second fuse
that gives you two steps out the door
pan across troy and doc listen intently
archie cuts the fuse on the ball with his knife
the three of them stand at the door ready
archie holds his pistol ready
doc holds the football troy holds the lighter
wait imam lying in a ditch is concealed on the side of the bunker and aims an old rifle at the chopper
gunshots ring off the side of the chopper chipping plastic
the chopper banks toward vig in response
vig watches the chopper turn toward him
god help me
troy flicks the lighter and with a shaking hand tries to light the fuse
archie steadies troys hand
the fuse is lit
archie fires his pistol as he goes out the door with troy also firing a pistol
doc follows with the ball fuse burning
doc throws the ball hard at the chopper hovering feet up
the chopper turns to face the ball just as it hits the plexiglas window and bounces off not exploding
the pilots look perplexed
the ball hits the ground and explodes
archie troy doc stunned turn back to the bunker
they run inside and take cover catch their breath
troy and doc look terrified
shorter fuse this time
he pulls out the second ball cuts another fuse affixes it
they wait at the door again watching the chopper
imam from the side of the bunker fires again the chopper swivels toward him to return fire troy lights the second fuse
they bolt out the door troy and archie firing pistols doc in the middle with the ball
slow to freeze frame mid stride with just the sound of the chopper archie doc troy three abreast mid stride
resume regular speed doc unleashes the football
pan to slightly slow motion the ball hits the chopper broadside and the chopper explodes into a ball of fire
slightly slow motion the chopper comes crashing to the ground in a heap of metal
the rotary spins off whips over archie troy and docs heads and smashes into the bunker
troy and doc look at each other and punch their fists together
troy notices that hes wet his pants

check every iraqi here
archie rolls over bodies lying on the ground pulls out their weapons
troy and doc take rifles from wounded iraqis
agitated wheres conrad

doc nervously scans the area with his pistol pointed
shiite prisoners start streaming out of the bunker

imam directs the shiites to stay clustered near the bunker
jakar yizam ut naral how are we getting back

an iraqi soldier jumps up just as archie knocks him to the ground from behind and twists the gun away
doc binds the soldiers hands with a plastic cuff

archie pulls pistols from the bloody bodies of the two iraqis in the chopper
thats a convertible

troy and archie look at each other smile slightly
they all turn to look
wide shot vig pops up in the desert yards away
you made it
vig comes running
i thought that was you
troy smiles as he steps in the direction of vig
suddenly a rifle shot rings out troy jumps
slightly slow motion vig is hit in the collar bone only the sound of the bullet smashing his flesh and bone
he is jerked falls to his knees but gets up keeps staggering toward troy yards away
troy looks stunned
archie turns sharply to his right and fires a rifle
an iraqi soldier yards to the side drops to the ground as archie and doc continue to hit him with gunfire
troy runs as hard as he can toward vig
doc looks around frantically with his pistol pointed
archie scans the area and directs shiite riflemen to spread out
lock it down
shoot anything that moves
translates haza janav yasat
troy runs catches the staggering vig in his arms and embraces him
blood runs from vigs mouth onto troys shoulder as vig tries to talk
you made it man troy cries as he runs with vig in his arms
doc takes vig from troys arms and carefully lays him on the ground cradling his head in his lap
vig spits blood
what happened to the jesus fire doc

i guess i could go to one of them shrines that erase the bad you did we made the right choice today conrad

the hole in vigs collar bone is pumping out blood
troy puts his hands over it
doc looks sad and scared as he tries to turns vigs head to help him breathe
dear lord watch over this man help him if you can
our father who art in heaven shiites children and adults sit on the ground near the bunker watch from afar
troy stands up looking around helplessly
hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done a gunshot rings out and slightly slow motion hits troy in the lower right chest and comes out again
three inches over piercing a thin piece of his side with only the sound of tearing tissue
troy looks stunned as he is spun around by the shot
archie spins around in the desert and looks at troy
he runs hard across the desert toward troy
troy falls next to vig and they look at each other
troys eyes are wide with pain as he breathes with great difficulty rasping
his breathing creates an air pocket crushing his organs to the left side
looking up at doc who is saying something to troy but theres no sound except troys labored breathing the pov turns to the side vig is no longer breathing
flashback to the opening scene but with weird muffled take my picture

troy lies on the ground trying to breathe eyes wide
archie and imam step into frame
archie looks down at troy opens his waist pack pulls out a sterile wrapped scalpel
