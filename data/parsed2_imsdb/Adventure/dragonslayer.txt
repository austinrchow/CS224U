screenplay by hal barwood and matthew robbins now comes the moon riding over the horizon
upon a hill at the edge of the wood squats a castle its crude stonework bathed in cold silvery light
queer carvings and runes decorate the ponderous gate
heavy vines are climbing up the walls
the castle is old its unfamiliar form testament to an ancient mind and an ancient craft
flickering candle light dances on a leaded windowpane
inside the corridors are dark and silent
under low arched ceilings the uneven floors are paved with stone blocks
perched over lintels and crouched in niches are icons with strange animal heads
a sleep on a straw palette in a room strewn with vegetables and crockery is hodge a wrinkled old retainer
a flickering candle and empty jug are beside the bed
he is snoring gently
this circular chamber at the heart of the castle is stuffed with parchments scrolls dusty books bronze braziers glass retorts chemical salts birds both stuffed and caged
an iron candelabra stands on a work table tapers burning
in the soft glow it seems that the room is unoccupied but no moving in the background is a shadowy figure preparing for a magical deed
feet are positioned carefully within a pentagram chiseled into the floor
a scroll is consulted up comes an arm and a voice blurts out omnia in duos duo in unum unus in nihil haec nec quattuor nec omnia nec duo nec
unus nec nihil sunt
come on candles out
but the little flames stand at attention without so much as a tremble
in volunta divina et verbum magi lux
its no use
there is a sigh and the figure moves forward into the light
revealed in the glow is the discouraged face of galen bradwardyn sorcerers apprentice
carrying the candelabra the youth trudges up a circular staircase
the highest point of the castle is a turret open to the stars and the night air
here more magic is afoot
an old enchanter ulrich magister ipsissimus pours water from a silver ewer into a stone bowl
as the surface ripples disappear he leans forward and gazes into the pool
all at once his face hardens as the distant sounds of screams and thunder reach his ears
lights and shadows reflected from within the basin play across his face
his frown deepens as the sound of his own voice comes to him from the vision in the water draco draconis suddenly squelched by the roar of flame and an
at that moment galen reaches the top of the steps and holds up the candelabra
theres something wrong
ulrich startled from his trance slaps the water out of the basin and turns to confront his student
galen is taken aback by the old mans grim countenance
whats the matter
ive just seen something
something of consequence to you
my own death
with a distracted gesture he causes the flames to extinguish themselves
perhaps we had better hasten your training
outside the castle wall hodge is feeding the chickens and ducks
he straightens up and squints through the early morning mists
on a distant hillock two figures are moving toward the woods
hobbling slowly with the aid of a pair of canes ulrich guides his pupil across a wooden bridge and along a stream into the forest
stern and troubled this wood these leaves the birds the very dome of heaven once they all rang with one great chord and philosophers like me kept it all in
now new voices are singing new songs
sharply have you mastered the threefold transmutation
skeptical you have
its very difficult
have you committed to memory undying the codex de profundis
a shrug the first two chapters
and what about the ritual of banishment as prescribed by my late master balisarius
to tell the truth i havent dared try it
whats the point anyway
the point is you dont know it and youre no magician without it
it was my hope to school you to mold your faculties and wits
i still believe you have some talent
i hate books
i hate drill
i want a real task
theres no time now
when im gone half the powers in the universe will vanish with me
and whats the use of a few lingering skills if theyre left in the hands of a child
i dont hear anything
ulrich gauges the young man standing before him and makes a decision
reaching under his cloak he lifts off a fine silver chain with an amulet dangling from it
he drapes it around galens neck
here wear this
galen instinctively wraps his hand around the jewel
he cocks an ear
voices singing on the road
he hastens forward to a promontory eager to have a look
ulrich does not follow
instead doffing his cloak he whirls it before him where it magically floats a few feet off the ground
awkwardly the old man clambers aboard
i dont see anything
he turns back but the wizard is gone
a shadow falls over him
he looks up
there two hundred feet above the tree tops his master is soaring on the wind
the old conjurer squints into the distance
miles away and far below a company of drab walkers winds along the margins of the forest
they are singing a mournful round
he gawks skyward
suddenly the old man leans down and addresses him
a shout we have visitors
clustering together in the center of a wide reception hall is a contingent of weary peasants awkward amidst the dusty rugs drapes and heavy furniture
their leader is a fineboned youth not yet twenty
like the others he is uneasy his name is valerian
hodge enters and sets a tray of mead before them
he leaves without a word
the visitors stare glumly at the refreshment but are too timorous to go near it
galen helps ulrich prepare for the audience
the sorcerer peers at himself in a full length mirror adjusting the hem of a black robe
looks forbidding enough dont you think
here are your sticks
no theyll think me infirm
you know balisarius wore this whenever he changed lead into gold
he could really do that you know
i never could
too bad youd stand to inherit some real wealth
youre in a morbid frame of mind
whats all this about dying
you dont even look sick
tying on a sash you still wearing that amulet
galen nods good
dont lose it
it still belongs to me
he backs away from the mirror and fits a silver coronet onto his head
now adeptus minor get yourself a handful of that sulphurous ash over there
the sorcerer starts down a circular stone staircase
the visitors watch warily as a door swings open and galen makes his entrance his face expressionless and hands pressed together
he looks rather young to be the famous ulrich
galen allows a moment to go by then throws his arms wide
and ulrich appears in the doorway in a smoky fireball
alarmed the visitors retreat
nunc habeus lux
around the room candles flare in their niches
in the fireplace the birch logs are suddenly ablaze
ulrich totters to the hearth and extends long bony fingers toward the warmth
welcome to cragganmore
i am ulrich
which one of you calls himself valerian
the travelers are suitably dazzled by the magicians performance
the young leader of the party screws up his courage and speaks
that would be me
we are here on behalf
i know why youre here
youre a delegation from urland from beyond dalvatia
lets see the artifacts
the travelers exchange nervous glances
valerian motions to one of his companions
the man steps forward and hands over a leather pouch
one by one valerian places the contents on the table for ulrichs inspection
a rock fire blackened
at this ulrich advances and closely examines three shimmering irridescent disks as big as saucers
how did you come by these
proudly i found them
at the mouth of the lair
grim what else
valerian reaches under his jerkin and withdraws what appears to be a curved sword
he jabs it into the table
thats no claw
its a tooth
by the gods
he runs a finger along a serrated edge and gazes bleakly at his visitors
and you want me to do battle with that
valerian has lost all trace of timidity
who else can we turn to
we all know what were dealing with here
this is a basilicok
he takes a step forward a cockatrice
another step bolder a dragon
he leans close to ulrich this is no stag no bear no natural creature
this is one of your kind
and only a necromancer such as yourself can rid us of it
did you try the meredydd sisters
what about rinbod
ive heard it said he killed a dragon once
theyre all dead
youre the only one left
with a sigh ulrich lowers himself into a chair
he rubs his withered legs and shakes his head
its a long way to urland
every quarter upon the solstices and the equinoxes theres a new victim
greil a grizzled peasant speaks up
my daughter for one
virgins to be exact chosen by lot
galen edges over to the table and inspects the scales and tooth
master dont you think silence
he broods for a long time
are you afraid of dragons
sorcerers and dragons go back a long long time together
if it werent for sorcerers there wouldnt be any dragons
pause all right
the travelers are making ready for departure in the grey light of dawn
as hodge stuffs provisions into a wicker box ulrich wraps padding on a newly fashioned pair of crutches
i know of this dragon
vermithrax pejorative shes four hundred years old
as far as i can tell shes the last of her kind
very appropriate that im the one to finish her off dont you think
he tries out the crutches there
flatten the highest mountain
what say you galen
no answer speak up
still no answer you hodge
hodge mutters something inaudible and grimly keeps packing
to galen while im gone see you keep your nose in your books and your hands out of my reagents
leave my instruments alone too
galen crouches against the castle wall he regards his master sullenly
look at yourself
how far will you get like that
a league two leagues
im not worried about the road
sarcastic why dont you wave your hands around and summon up a coach and four
dont mock me
galen gets up and calls out to the urlanders
you pilgrims youre used to lotteries
why not draw straws to see wholl be first to carry ironshanks here
this is too much for hodge
hold your tongue
if the masters got a mind to go hell go
galen approaches the old sorcerer
youre always saying i need seasoning
i need a test
let me go
youre not ready
im ready for anything
wan smile dont be so hasty
your time will come
the walkers are ready to set forth
hodge picks up his pack steps forward and pulls open the great gate
three mounted men are outside the gate helmets on their heads swords on the belts and longbows across their shoulders
they look formidable
the urlanders take a step backward
tyrian is a lean heavily bearded nobleman
there is a coat of arms on the shield strapped to the pommel of his saddle
amiable good morning all
were not afraid of you
give us the road
why the road is yours
all the way to urland
its a long journey isnt it
but when youre in search of a sorcerer i suppose no distance is too great
sensing trouble galen moves forward
ulrich touches his arm
under his breath say nothing
galen hears the urgency in the old mans voice and obeys
hodge takes it upon himself to deal with the strangers
what do you want with us
well like my good friends here ive come for a bit of black magic
no doubt youve heard of our troubles at home
this is cragganmore is it not
aye this be the place of ulrich
tyrian dismounts and saunters up to the old magician
and here we have the mystical presence himself no
youd best keep your distance and your manners
if hes ready to lay a dragon in its grave hes got nothing to fear from me
turns to the urlanders ive no more love for that creature than you lot
nor has the king
but before you stir things up dont you think it a good idea to see youve got the right man for the job
aha its a test youre looking for
we dont do tests
im sure you dont
they never do tests and not many real deeds either
oh conversation with your grandmothers shade in a darkened room the odd love potion or two
but comes a doubter well then its the wrong day the planets are not aligned the entrails arent favorable we dont do tests
weve got no doubts
we require no test
and youre not going to get one
when ulrich finally speaks his voice is low and authoritative
to galen go to the conjuring room
the iron box
fetch me the dagger within
galens eyes widen with alarm
galen dashes into the castle
ulrich gazes almost shyly at tyrian
you shall have your test
galen comes puffing up the steps locates the iron box and flings it open
amidst the tawdry paraphernalia of a professional magician is an ivory handled dagger covered with runic inscriptions
galen eagerly examines it to see how the blade might twist aside or collapse into the handle but it is all too genuine
a murder weapon
impatient where are you boy
galen throws open a window and looks down into the courtyard
he displays the dagger
not this one was it
the very one
let it fall
galen hesitates then tosses it
tumbling end over end it arcs downward
the old conjurer calmly stretches out a hand and plucks it neatly out of the air
galen watches as ulrich passes the weapon to tyrian and strips back his robe exposing a bony chest
galen knows whats coming
he rushes for the door
hes only a step away when it bangs shut of its own accord
he sprints for a second exit
this door slams shut too
quick back to the window and climb down the vine
the heavy shutters seal him in
ulrich takes tyrians arm and guides the point of the dagger to his breastbone
vita regula vita hieratica
everyone is filled with dread
hodge is shaking
from the castle come the rattling of shutters and galens muffled cries
a sick sarcastic smile has crept over tyrians lips
he tenses himself to thrust
dont worry you cant hurt me
galen stops hammering and presses his face to a crack in the shutter
below he can see the participants in this grisly drama
he holds his breath
tyrian makes a sudden movement and buries the blade in ulrichs chest
but the sorcerer stands unbent seemingly unhurt
then after a long moment he slowly sags forward over the dagger and the hand that holds it
tyrian shrinks back and allows the body to fall in a heap
very quickly he remounts
in another moment he and his companions are gone
the others are riveted in horror
hodge sinks to his knees and wails his grief
galen turns away from the window and gazes blankly into the gloomy conjuring room
the doors unlatch themselves and swing open
ulrich principal magician and sorcerer of the western world reposes on a hardwood pyre
his hands are folded on his chest
his face is peaceful
while the visitors wordlessly look on galen touches a burning brand to the kindling
at first the fire catches normally enough but when the flames start to envelop the body they suddenly turn pale green producing an unearthly roar
the onlookers back away from the intense heat
the erstwhile apprentice stands his ground blinking back tears his face weirdly illuminated by the fire
galen sits alone amidst the museum like collection of magical apparatus
he stares at the amulet considering its significance
his reverie is interrupted by the murmur of voices below
at the window he looks down to see hodge bidding farewell to the delegation from urland
valerian is the last to leave
he pauses at the gate and glances up at galen
then he moves on
the young student of magic sets his jaw suddenly filled with resolve
moving through the room he busies himself with the old mans effects
he scoops up the loose books and parchments and locks them into trunks
he drapes muslin cloths over the alchemical devices
he sows a handful of salt over the pentagram inscribed in the floor
finally he opens the cages and releases the crow the falcon and the great horned owl
hodge is up on the burned out funeral pyre anxiously scraping ashes and small bones into a leather pouch the remains of ulrich
up behind him comes galen now clad in a travelers cloak with a pack on his back and a staff in his hand
hodge what are you doing
hodge quickly conceals the pouch
just making my farewell thank you very much
he quickly climbs down picks up his pack and follows galen out through the gate
as the door is pushed shut a huge oaken timber falls into place barring the castle against the uninvited
galen and hodge labor to the crest of a grassy hill and turn to look back across a wide valley
there on another hilltop on the far side sits cragganmore lit by the red rays of the setting sun
galen removes the amulet from his neck and clutches it in his fist
hodge is bug eyed to see it
be careful with that
you dont know what youre doing
he raises his hands toward the castle and calls out cragganmore
domus non i am
the vines on the castle walls begin to twitch and stretch magically brought to animate life
they flow upward over the masonry branching out and covering every surface then up onto the roof
finally only the tops of the chimneys and the highest turrets stand above the green carpet
a centurys growth in a matter of seconds
on their hilltop the old retainer gives the youth a fearful look
galen is too flushed with excitement over what he has done to notice
galen and hodge trudge along an overgrown cart track under an arch of trees
oh its a vale of tears in which we dwell
it doesnt matter who you are a king in his robes a peasant in his rags when your time comes no magic can save you
the apprentices mind is elsewhere hes got a coin hovering in mid air above his palm bobbing gently as he walks
the kindest lord a man could ask for
now hes gone
ye gods he was fussy about his bath
and youd think he could boil his own eggs with the snap of a finger but no he had old hodge do it of course
snurfling up before five i was mucking out the cages slopping the pigs and never once got so much as a thankyou or a pat on the back
through tears im going to miss him
he plucks a low hanging leaf waves a hand over it and watches it turn into a spray of daffodils
no you dont
all you care about is the tricks and knavery
well you dont pull any wool over these old eyes
itll be a mighty long walk before you fill his shoes you mark my word
whats the matter hodge pack too heavy
he gives the pack a slap
it flies out of its harness and floats alongside them
hodge snatches it back and clutches it tightly
careful with that
too cold is it
a great coat drapes itself over hodges shoulders
the greatcoat disappears as do the rest of his garments leaving him in his smalls
spluttering stop it i say
out of respect for the master
suppressing a grin galen mercifully waves his hand and restores hodge to his usual costume
ive got as much respect for the master as anyone old man
but then again im master now
the urlanders are gathered around a fire sharing a meager supper
the man named greil pokes at the stew pot
i left my farm with seeds unplanted calves unborn nothing but a wife to chase down the strays and for what
a funeral thats what
he walks up and down behind valerian
because some people said find a magician
not just a local fellow an import a good forty leagues from home
an all powerful necromancer
ha some necromancer
malkin an older man speaks up
hold your tongue greil
ill not sit
ill not eat
see you the great bear
his tail points east
its the equinox
have you forgotten
or rather not think about it
miserable hes right
i brought us here for nothing
may the gods help whoevers daughter it is tonight
there is a noise from the darkness beyond the campfire
two of the men get to their feet and listen
at first silence then more rustling
without a word the two men dart into the bushes and haul two interlopers before the company galen and hodge
good morrow good morrow
peace be with you
we mean no harm
weve been looking for you
growl well youve found us
brushing himself off more the other way around id say
what do you want
a few words thats all
you were looking for a conjurer
requiscat in pace
he takes a deep breath ecce magister novus
how say you
galen surveys the puzzled faces
he draws himself up and plunges in my lord ulrich is no longer
all that you asked of him you may now expect of me
the dangers he would face i will now conquer
the task he would undertake i will now fulfill
i am galen bradwardyn inheritor of ulrichs craft and knowledge and i am the sorcerer you seek
there is a moment of depressed silence
hodge rolls his eyes
greil starts to chuckle then to laugh
soon the others are laughing too
well thats a handsome thought o wizard of wizards
but if theres one thing our friend tyrian has shown us its to beware the pig in the poke
whos got a dagger
call it proof then
someone brings out a dagger and hands it to greil
valerian pushes it away
weve seen enough tests
but greil persists waving the knife at the group
well i havent
all ive seen is death
death in our families death on the road and tonight death at home
he lashes out with the knife
galen jumps back but valerian steps in delivering a quick kick to greils gut followed by a right to the jaw that sends the bigger man sprawling
he takes the knife
whats come over you anyway
have you lost your wits
he propels galen out of harms way and sits him down on the other side of the fire
greil nurses his jaw
i dont like it
young snot nose comes in here for sport at our expense
were on a fools errand but we dont have to listen to this
i dont want to hear any more about sorcery
i dont want to hear any more about spells
valerian hands galen a plate of food
you must be hungry
nods whats the matter with him
its not just him
its all of us
its the equinox
they both look up at the moon
the moon shines down on the far reaches of the kingdom of urland coldly lighting a barren landscape filled with the skeletons of dead trees blackened rock and bare ground
advancing across this mournful terrain is a troop of armed men leading a blindfolded horse and tumbril
the horse is skittish
finally in spite of shouts and lashings it refuses to go further
the leader horsrik barks out an order close enough
bring her out
a young woman no more than seventeen is brought forth from the cart
long black hair falls down over a white tunic
her dark eyes dart fearfully around in her pale face
she is half carried half dragged to the edge of a steaming crack in the ground where she is manacled to a wooden post
by lantern light horsrik reads from a parchment scroll
now be it known throughout the kingdom that this maiden having lawfully been chosen by a deed of fortune and destiny shall hereby give up her life for the greater
good of urland
there is a low rumble the earth shakes
horsrik glances nervously around
he carries on by rote
by this act shall be satisfied the powers that dwell underground and the spirits that attend thereto
in gratitude for this sacrifice his majesty has declared the family whats the name
he prods the girl but she is too terrified to speak
beneath them the earth seems to groan
smoke issues from the mouth of the pit
one of the nervous witnesses leans forward
the family plowman
rushing it the family plowman to be free of obligations taxations levys and imposts for a period not to exceed five years
the horse suddenly rears and blindfold notwithstanding gallops off dragging the tumbril over the rocks
the men behind horsrik break ranks and scatter
ordained and signed this day etc
casiodorus in his glory the reigning king of this our realm
his seal his mark duly read by chancellor horsrik in his holy name
now horsrik joins the flight chasing his men back over the murky horizon
she strains against her manacles cocking her head to listen as the rumblings below subside
presently the steam and smoke blow away and she can see the horse pawing and stamping a hundred yards distant the wheel of the cart jammed between rocks
summoning up a wild will to live she squeezes her hands against the cold iron rings
she spits on her wrists and twists desperately
one hand slips free
she looks at the horse
the animal tosses off its blindfold and looks back at her
now she strains again and pulls her other hand free
she wipes the blood on her frock and sprints toward the horse
but she doesnt get there
the earth abruptly shifts from under her feet tumbling her among cracked and steaming rocks
when she raises her head a huge shadow has fallen over the horse
there is a piteous whinny then a roar
the girls face is suddenly lit by flames
she scrambles to her feet and rushes back the other way
the girl hasnt taken a dozen steps when something huge hurtles forward and blocks her way
something scaly and glittering
she whirls and stumbles off in a new direction
this time shes cut off by a monstrous claw tipped with rapier like talons
she screams and crawls away
another claw prevents her escape
membranous wings fold down against the night sky
up comes the silhouette of a reptilian head swaying on a serpentine neck
theres an angry hiss
a sheet of flame envelops everything
tyrian kneels beside a mountain waterfall having a drink while his men hover in the background
one of them points down the slope
i see them
tyrian wipes his mouth unhurriedly and strolls over to look
far below half hidden by trees the little company of urlanders winds its way through the forest
a frown creeps over tyrians face
whos that old man
thats the man from cragganmore
now whats he doing here
filling in for the chief i reckon
weary what a pity
hodge marches along with the rest
when hes sure no one else is looking he burrows into his garments and brings out the leather pouch containing ulrichs ashes
reassured that its still with him he tucks it away again
galen falls into step
what have you got there
none of your business
a little gold eh
what do you say i change it into lead
save your jokes for someone else
me i dont care for braggarts
they pass valerian who has dropped out of line
and i dont care for frauds
im no fraud
call it fool then
whatever pleases you
hodge nobody forced you to come along
oh im here of my own free will all right
we each do the masters bidding in our own way
well if he told you i needed wetnursing why dont you just turn yourself around and go back home
hodge snorts and fusses with his pack
home is it
youve seen to that havent you
gone to seed id say
he glances over and discovers galen missing
he walks back along the trail looking for valerian
pretty soon the rest of the travelers are out of sight
he hears the sound of a splash
he turns off the trail and pushes through some shrubbery
under the oaks and hickory a forest stream has widened into a quiet pool
a pile of clothes lies on a rock at the edge
out in the middle valerian is treading water
youre too far behind us
come on out
you go ahead ill catch up
not a good idea to get separated
ill be along
galen leans over and splashes some water on his face
he shucks his pack and starts to throw off his clothes
valerian doesnt like it
thats all right
dont come in
but galen is now naked and walking into the water
he swims out toward valerian
edgy you better get back to the group theyre probably worried
galen keeps swimming
i prefer to swim alone if you dont mind
but galen has slipped beneath the surface he doesnt hear
galen works his way through the murky green underwater world
suddenly he stops short and stares
hes only a few feet from valerians dangling legs
he gasps in surprise
valerian is no boy
galen comes shooting to the surface coughing and sputtering
by the gods
valerian is pale and frightened
she propels herself backward then turns and swims for shore
galen and valerian have taken refuge behind separate bushes
briskly they pull on their clothes
i suppose youll tell everyone
go ahead i dont care
its a relief
im not going to say anything
i dont blame you
i was stupid
a silly woman
feeble bluff take it easy
i knew the moment i saw you
ive known the whole time
you never knew a thing
no one knew
not since i was born
go on run off and tell them
itll make a great story
no ones going to find out
just tell me why
ask my father
they finish dressing in silence
finally the lottery
daughters are chosen but sons are not
unless you have plenty of gold or property
what do you mean
if youre rich enough your name never goes in
bitter my father is poor
so are a lot of fathers
he studies her
she jams a hat down over her head and once more the young man stalks off
galen walks down to the edge of the pool to retrieve his pack
as he leans over he catches sight of what appears to be a reflection in the water tyrian on horseback
he whips around but no one is behind him
riveted by the vision he hurries along the bank to follow it
after a few paces the blurry figure dismounts unslings a longbow nocks an arrow and draws the string taut
galen sprints through the trees
up ahead is valerian walking resolutely
she glances back at him and grimly keeps on walking
galen shoots past her and on into the forest
galen races up the trail rounds a bend and sees the urlanders coming toward him
hodge precedes the group with an unsteady gait
he sees galen raises up his arms and flops face down on the trail
a long arrow protrudes from his back
galen kneels beside him
the uneasy company keeps its distance
hodge struggles to speak
can you hear me
i hear you
you know somebody shot me but i can still talk
theres something that has to be done
not that cockatrice
hodges hand comes out from under his coat gripping the leather pouch
galen tugs at it but hodge cant let go
sorry youll have to peel it loose
galen pries the sack out of hodges clenched fingers
suddenly the hand comes up grabs galen by the hair and pulls him near
a croak burning water
find the lake throw it in
holding up the pouch what are you doing with this hodge
galen frees himself from his grasp
hodge dont die
listen to me
youre not going to die
galen is frantic
he pulls out the amulet and wraps his hand around it
he shakes the body excede mortem
but hodge has passed on and galens magic has no way to reach him
suddenly the youth cries out in pain
he drops the amulet and looks at his palm
the device has burned his flesh
now he becomes aware of troubled urlanders looking over his shoulder witness to his failure
wind whips the leaden wave tops on a vast rainy lake
the travelers are rowing across in an open longboat aided by a tattered lateen sail
valerian mans the steering oar at the stern while galen broods in the bow
he feels like an imposter in their eyes
the boat pulls into a long narrow waterway with granite cliffs on either side
moving through swirls of fog they beach the boat and step out onto a craggy shore
greil leans over and kisses a rock
the travelers descend a mountain pass and emerge through a wrack of cloud into a gray and cheerless region
fire blackened trees dot the barren landscape
as they reach the flatlands the urlanders instinctively pick up the pace
galen slows to inspect the weird surroundings
valerian trots past him
dont dawdle here
galen falls into step with her
the whole kingdom like this
were near the lair
galen looks around with new interest
were in no danger if we just pass through quickly
high on the slope beside them is a gaping fissure
i see it
lets have a look
but galen is already toiling up the incline
the travelers turn to see whats the matter
galen approaches the lair pausing beside a wooden post with iron manacles dangling from it
he fingers them thoughtfully
malkin greil and valerian rush up behind him their faces drawn with worry
look you dont have to do this
we know youre a fine young magician
theres no need to prove it to us
are there other entrances
the roads this way
well tell everybody how close you got
coolly no smoke
how do you know its in there
dont be a fool
come away now and live to tell about it
instead galen starts into the crack
greil and malkin hasten away but valerian lingers watching in mounting frustration as galen probes further and further into the lair
she picks up a fistful of stones and throws them at him
youre going to die
what a fine trick that will be
but galen is lost in the gloom
galen puts his hand on the rugged wall the rocks are hot to the touch
something glinting on the floor catches galens eye an irridescent disk a dragon scale
it flashes the colors of the rainbow as galen examines it
all at once the ground shudders chunks of rock fall from the ceiling
a pall of smoke billows up from the depths
galen staggers out of the fissure coughing and gagging in a swirl of smoke
there is no sign of the urlanders
he throws down his pack climbs onto a huge boulder and surveys the massive cliffs rising behind the lair
he grasps the amulet and closes his eyes
now great mountain hear my command terrae lapsus consignet latibulum draconis
evanescat latibulum draconis
with a thunderous splitting sound the entire top of the cliff pitches forward and topples onto the lower half of the mountain sweeping tons of debris into the air
boulders the size of houses bound down the mountain toward the magician
eyes wide with awe he turns and runs for his life
even as he careens down the slope chunks of rock rumble past
one catches him at the knee and sends him flying
he covers his head and joins the landslide
finally the dust lifts and he finds himself in a gully face to face with the cowering urlanders
they look with real fear at the man who just conjured up the apocalypse
tattered and torn covered with dirt galen climbs up out of the shelter for a look at his handiwork
the territory has been drastically transformed the dragons lair is now buried beneath hundreds of tons of broken granite
the urlanders look upon the new landscape with stupefaction
galen grins a triumphant split lip grin that fails to win them over
presently they back away and run off down the trail valerian in their midst
galens grin fades
the village of swanscombe is little more than a rough and ready collection of thatched huts and mud daubed outbuildings surrounded by cultivated fields
dogs sleep in open door ways chickens peck around the communal well but there are no people in evidence as valerian and her company troop into town
she trots across the square and enters a deserted blacksmith shop
she goes over to the forge
hot coals are burning
she becomes aware of a sound voices chanting
she walks across the square toward the voices
she is joined by greil malkin and the other travelers all of them puzzled by the desolation
as they approach the grange hall the voices grow louder
they seem to be singing
the main doors open briefly and three villagers scamper out dripping wet and wrapped in white muslin
valerian and her companions look at each other in astonishment
in a wooden cistern in the middle of the hall a woman is being held under water
after a few moments she is pulled to the surface by a tall red haired man with long bony fingers brother jacopus januensis a carthusian monk
theres a wooden cross on his chest and a mad look in his eye
gathered around him are the missing villagers every man woman and child here to be baptised and sing a few newly learned hymns in praise of our lord jesus christ
now are you cleansed of your sins
now are you born again purified in spirit into the fellowship of jesus christ
the travelers enter and mingle with the congregation
valerian scans the crowd until she locates her father simon a balding sturdy journeyman
hes overjoyed at her return and gives her a hearty embrace
welcome back my son
father what are you doing
have you all lost your minds
he points to the monk who is dunking a screaming infant and carrying on about the bishop of rome
its this monk
he can read and write and talk too im afraid
and they listen
they think this a holy place a tabernacle
this is the granary
what kind of welcome is this
ive got news of the sorcerer and news of the dragon
you were brave to go you and your friends
but nobody cares
listen he knows what they want to hear
brother jacopus strides back and forth before the assembly in an inspired state
the man who walks with christ is not a man to fear a dragon yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no
you say you are preyed upon by a foul beast
yes but what is the nature of this beast
it comes to you on bats wings and clawed feet does it not
it breathes fire does it not
and it lives under ground
this is no dragon
this is lucifer
whoever it is hes dead
this is galen who has just stepped into the hall tattered bedraggled and triumphant
it is not as easy as that
allegiance to christ to be sure but also prayer and confession
these are the arms by which satan may be put down
youre talking about superstition friend
none of that has anything to do with what i galen have already achieved
he marches to the center of the gathering
to valerian you brought this stranger
hes a braggart but it doesnt matter
people of urland
send a messenger to the king
vermithrax is dead
crushed by the power of the moon and the stars
laid low by ancient wisdom
dropped into the abyss by mystical practice
spoken like a pagan
every word as reprobate as it is false
holding up his cross solum in hoc signo vinces
nihil plus mysterium
he gestures boldly and a fireball crackles at the monks feet
the holy man scurries back
a hush falls upon the congregation
a procession of curious villagers winds its way into the badlands
they gather on a promontory overlooking the dragons lair
they stand there for a long time a chill wind whipping their garments trying to understand whats happened
the monk is mightily displeased
blessed is he that is humble before the lord
your god had nothing to do with it
indeed galens act is already the stuff of legend we saw it with our own eyes
he flew to the mountain top
he was a bird
he brought forth lightning
i saw it
some of the younger villagers scamper forward to the spot where the cave had its opening
with yells and whoops they beat the ground with clubs
in the crowd simon begins to smile then to laugh
soon he leads the villagers in a tumultuous cheer
brother jacopus and some of his converts drop to their knees and pray
the inhabitants of swanscombe have decked out the town square and are making a night of it
by torchlight they dance merrily to jigs and reels provided by the local fiddlers
ale flows freely from oak casks
valerian is kneeling before a trunk full of womens clothing
she pulls out a long simple frock goes to a crude mirror and holds it up against her body to gauge the effect
her father comes up behind her
he is angry and frightened
put that away
what if you were seen
im going to be seen
i want to be seen
tonight the world finds out that you never had a son
no you mustnt do that
its too soon
weve got to think about this weve got to make a plan
father the danger is over
he sits on the bed and puts his head in his hands
what am i going to say to my friends who still mourn for their lost girls
youll say you did what you had to
this is a time for celebration and forgiveness
he looks up at her trying to imagine what its going to be like having a daughter
galen is surrounded by a crowd of wide eyed kids and not a few adults entertaining them by pulling ducks eggs out of their ears and causing coins to disappear
presently he feels the attention of his audience shift away to someone standing behind him
he turns to find a shy but determined valerian sweetly decked out in her blue frock
a buzz goes through the crowd
valerian blushes and wavers she seems ready to bolt for home
but galen takes her by the hand and with conspicuous politesse leads her to the dance
its forward back and around sixth century style the young sorcerer cant take his eyes off his partner
but shes too shy to return his gaze
looks like youve been up to a little sorcery yourself
valerian doesnt know what to say
or is it witchcraft
she still doesnt reply
its all she can do to keep on dancing
whats the matter
a real woman never stops talking
i think it was much easier being a boy
they stand on the sidelines watching the young couple step to the music
the damnedest thing is she was twice the man of anyone else in the village
now shes twice the woman
grim would that i had been as clever as her father
come now greil
dont begrudge a life spared
i begrudge nothing
but i wonder at what we have seen and how it was done
you were there
i saw what i saw
but this jack anapes was barely ready to carry his masters chamberpot
isnt it strange that at the very moment the beast is put down we should have a holy man here in the village
you dont believe that superstitious christian rot do you
defensive it is said god works his wonders in mysterious ways
while the proud simon dances in the background with his daughter a group of tipsy villagers clusters around galen belching forth a drinking song
the young magician raises his own mug and joins in on the chorus
abruptly the music stops
the singing dies away
the ensuing silence is broken by the sound of galloping hooves
presently three horsemen appear at the end of town tyrian and his henchmen
they guide their horses forward into the midst of the merry makers
tyrian dismounts and looks around in his usual friendly way
dont stop on my account
you musicians more music
the musicians leave their instruments in their laps
tyrian draws himself a measure of ale and raises it above his head
to the deed of the day
you see good news travels fast
the king himself has already heard it
and like yourselves tonight hes overcome with joy
what would you have of us then
not a thing
its this one
he gestures toward galen the king would meet our new benefactor and offer his gratitude to the man who succeeded where so many have failed
sobering up what sort of gratitude
a knife in the belly
an arrow in the back
tyrians smile freezes on his face
he steps in front of galen towering over him
my young friend id as soon dispatch you as i did the others and for the same reason
but his majesty would like a cozy chat and commands otherwise
dont go galen
cast a spell and turn them into toads
it should be easy thats what they are
tyrian regards her coolly taking in her change of costume and its meaning
well well still plenty of cheek under those skirts it seems
having buried the dragon under a mountain galen decides hes not worried about an appearance at court
he smiles at valerian
ill be back
three horses gallop through the moors and fens of central urland
galen is tucked up behind tyrian
on the distant horizon the battlements of the kings castle glow in the slanting light of a new day
within the castle is a great hall with shafts of daylight poking in through narrow windows set high in the walls
in the middle of the room stands a carved oak throne
there is casiodorus rex king of urland a bearded man in his fifties as spare and somber as the room in which he sits
he is flanked by a few servants assorted courtiers and tyrian
standing before them all is galen looking unhappy
he pours a pitcher full of water into a small glazed goblet
one of the best things about the water here in urland is that theres so much of it look at that
water continues to pour into the goblet without overflowing
galen takes a sip
but not cold enough
perhaps i could borrow a scarf from his majesty
the king makes no sign
galen approaches stiffly takes a scarf and retreats
i cover the goblet so
and behold winter in a mug
and hes done it he turns the goblet over and a small chunk of ice hits the floor
the royal reaction is equally frosty
galen is bombing and he knows it
how many of you have ever seen a table fly
he mutters an incantation
in the audience tyrian notes that galen has his hand wrapped around the amulet
there is a loud clatter as the heavy oak table before the throne begins to jitter and buck
as the wine spills and plates go flying the king wearily raises a hand
wait itll rise now
the table cracks in half and dumps a mess of fruit and crockery at the onlookers feet
tell me the landslide it was accomplished this same way
and having rendered such unique service to our kingdom what would you claim as a reward
please no payment
i have always found magical practice to be its own reward
i seek only some yet greater challenge
this handsome sentiment doesnt go over any better than his tricks
did you ever hear of king gaiseric
of course not you werent even born
he was my brother a great king and a valiant man at arms
when he ascended to the throne the dragon was unbridled
no one knew where it might strike next
so he brought forth his broadsword and his spear assembled a company of his best fighters and went out to do battle
pause he was never seen again
but his attack provoked the most terrible reprisals whole villages incinerated entire crops burned
death famine horrible
the king grimaces as the memories come flooding back
quietly how did you arrogate to yourself the role of savior
i was invited
not by me
did you ever consider the consequences of failure
whats the matter with you people
you want the dragon back
then the beast is dead
yes of course
we shall see
two guards thrust galen into a narrow cell and slam the barred door shut
the young sorcerer waits until theyre safely out of sight then takes out his amulet
he ponders it for a doubtful moment
suddenly a gloved hand darts in and whips it off his neck and out through the bars
he makes an ironic salute and leaves
galen sits down heavily and stares at the stone walls
unseen by galen a figure clad in silk and lace skitters down a murky dungeon hallway and peers around a corner
stealing a look at galen is the princess elspeth a fey beauty in her early twenties
after a moment spooked by some imagined noise she flits away
dark clouds slide across a pale sun throwing the ruined land below into shadow
soon fat droplets of rain are splattering on the rocks above the dragons lair
with each tiny splash there is a sizzle and a puff of steam
these rocks are hot
outside the barred window a steady rain is falling
inside galen uses a chunk of limestone to inscribe a pentagram on the floor of his cell
he marks runic signs on the window sill and lintel
then positioning himself in the center of the mystic symbol he raises his hands and spreads his fingers
authoritative cubiculum gravis aperat
theres a long moment when nothing happens
a very long moment
finally a thoroughly frustrated galen leaps to the window and rattles the bars
open up dammit
fenestra gravis aperat
asser gravis aperat
salve magistrum iuvenilum
startled galen whirls around to find elspeth standing outside his cell
she hands some food and blankets through the bars
ive studied latin
me appelo elspeth filia regis
galen looks her over
hes never seen anyone so angelic
how do you do
please dont think ill of us
my father is a wonderful man a wise man
the lottery was his idea
you dont understand
from the moment it began the dragon was tame
the kingdom prospered
and only a few had to be sacrificed
yes thats true
isnt it better that a few should die that many might live
depends on who does the dying
oh but we all take our chances
my father is a just man
my name is entered on the lists along with every other young virgin
if you say so
what do you mean
ive participated in every drawing since i came of age
you dont believe me
you think im lying
well im not
i heard a rumor
families with money that sort of thing
dont listen to rumors
i have to go now
wait how long do i have to stay in here
until we know
she slips away down the corridor
king casiodorus and tyrian are huddled over a table piled high with manuscripts and papers
tyrian clears a spot and sets out a stack of lead bars
lets not be greedy here
the king picks up galens amulet and holds it over the bars in his clenched fist
now then i casiodorus rex do hereby command thou base metal to change thy essence and become gold
there is a rustle of skirts and elspeth appears behind him
tyrian remove all but one bar
well try it one at a time
father did you know that some families have paid bribes to stay out of the lottery
the king and tyrian glance up at her
by the power of this amulet justly wielded by my hand in accordance with the laws of urland now lead be thou gold
the lead remains unchanged but the king gives out a cry and drops the amulet
what devilish thing is this
have you ever kept my name off the lottery list
thatll be all tyrian
you may withdraw
tyrian bows and exits
the king uses his sceptre to pick up the amulet and chain
he conceals it in a hollowed out book and places the volume on a shelf among many others
now my dear whats troubling you
answer my question am i not exposed to the same risk as every other mans daughter
the king paces over to the window and stares out
the rain has stopped
finally your father loves you very much
elspeth sways in dismay
a wail its true
what have you done to me
who fills your head with such ideas
at that moment a tremor passes through the room
king and daughter look at each other in alarm
the same tremor shakes the bars in galens cell
puzzled he rolls off his straw palette and gets to his feet
the tremor dies away
suddenly a violent shaking hits the cell bouncing galen off the walls
swanscombe is gripped by the same earthquake
dodging panicky barnyard animals valerian and her father join other frightened villagers in the center of town
above the dragons lair boulders are shifting and grinding together
massive chunks of stone break loose and tumble down the incline
the shaking has stopped
rock dust filters down from the ceiling
galen picks himself up and stares the door to his cell is off its hinges and is sagging open
he darts out
galen dashes along the hallway rounds a corner and stops
at the other end of the passage is tyrian
you little meddler
he draws his sword and advances
galen warily retreats
tyrian breaks into a run
galen turns and sprints away
unruly horses terrified by the quake rush blindly around the courtyard
hostlers try vainly to catch them
tyrian leans down from an upstairs window
close the main gate
the men below scramble for the gates
galen bursts out of hiding sees the untended horses and swings aboard as one goes past
a cry goes up from the guards
galen rides like mad for the exit but hes a half second late the doors boom shut in his face
he wheels the horse around
the kings men are coming toward him with pikes
digging his heels into the horses sides he urges the animal back across the courtyard up the steps and right into the building
galen gallops into the empty chamber knocking over the throne and vaulting a table
hot on his heels are armed soldiers
he kicks the horse again and shoots under an archway
the kitchen is already in chaos from the earthquake when galen charges in on his wild steed
food utensils and cooks go flying
he reins in ducks his head and squeezes the horse out into a narrow hallway
he clatters down the passageway
but here comes a contingent of footmen from the opposite direction
galen rides them into the walls
the horse scrabbles up the stairs galen tucked low against its neck
on the upper landing he comes face to face with tyrian and more soldiers
stab the horse
galen jerks the animal around and plunges back down the stairs
whinnying and blowing the horse bursts in a wild eyed galen still in the saddle
he finds himself confronting the king and his daughter
casiodorus grabs elspeth and retreats into a corner
tyrian sweeps in with his men
the doors slam shut
so much for your magic
so much for your sorcery
galen is trapped
just as tyrian reaches for the horses reins the animal rears up rolling its eyes
at that moment the floor heaves and cracks in a new series of shocks
the men at arms go down like ten pins
tyrian reels back dodging stone blocks loosened from the ceiling
as the shaking continues a weakened section of wall gives way
galen sees daylight
without even waiting for the quake to cease he prods the horse across the room and through the wall to freedom
the unnerved citizens of swanscombe gather on the promontory overlooking galens landslide
every few seconds there is a new shudder and more rocks pour down the long slope
valerian stands trembling with her father
presently brother jacopus elbows his way forward
listen to me my brethren
the moment of our fear is the moment of our triumph
this is a sign from god
follow me and our faith will send this creature straight to hell
holding a cross before him he starts up the slope
no one follows
they havent been christians all that long
one or two near valerian get down on their knees and pray silently
greil looks things over
you call yourselves christians
he strides after the monk
but hes the only one
the determined monk has arrived at the epicenter
his sandals are smoking on the hot gravel
sweat shines on his face and neck
the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
thou makest me to lie down in green pastures
thy rod and staff they comfort me
greil toils up the slope a hundred yards back
hes crossing himself but hes carrying a sickle
there is a thunderous noise
part of the mountain is tossed into the air
up from the depths comes a huge shining wing
then a neck uncoils and a head appears
it tips down toward the tiny human
firm for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen
at the base of the slope the villagers scatter
unclean beast get thee down
be thou consumed by the fires that made you
the dragons head sways back and forth then belches out a waterfall of flame
it engulfs jacopus and sends him to a better world if there is one
horse and rider race across a night landscape under brooding clouds
up ahead the sky glows with an angry red light
at the crest of a hill galen reins in and looks down across a long valley
there miles away is the village of swanscombe
many buildings are ablaze
as he watches in horror fires spring up in the fields and trees
intermittently he can see the silhouette of the dragon as it spreads destruction
finally the creature swoops up and away
galen stares skyward losing sight of it in the clouds
for a moment silence
then with a thunderous rush of air that almost blows him from the saddle the dragon reappears and hurtles a few feet over his head
it is gone in an instant
half the buildings in the town are on fire
desperate villagers dash here and there herding children and animals to safety trying to save their household goods
galen walks woodenly into the confusion leading his horse taking in the scope of the disaster
he comes upon a line of men who have formed a bucket brigade
he attempts to join up
as soon as he is recognized he is shouldered roughly aside
get away you little bastard
weve had enough help from you
galen staggers back reaching for his horse
the animal shies and trots off
a middle aged woman appears in front of him her face contorted with rage
she swings a flaming broom and catches him on the back of the head
galen reels away
this is your doing
galen looks up and sees a couple of burlies moving his way with boards in their hands
before they can get too close galen runs down an alley and bumps smack into a glassy eyed haunted man
it is greil
may the lord forgive you for what you have done
he pushes past
galen ducks behind a smoldering building
the roof has burned off but at least the walls are standing
valerian is wrestling charred timbers out of the center of the room
she is covered with soot
there is a hammering on the door and galen barges in
he slams the door behind him and puts his back against it
are you hurt
where have you been
doesnt matter listen quick
make it rain
thatll put the fire out
then get the animals back
theyre all running loose
theres people been hurt
stop their pain
you can cure them
and well need food
i cant do it
this stops her what
galens hand moves up to where the amulet used to hang
i just cant
but youre a sorcerer
im no sorcerer
whatever power i might have had its gone
it cant be
i know im an imposter
for a moment valerian is too stunned to speak
then her face colors
listen to that
the damn thing is loose were all on fire and youre sorry
galen sinks to the floor and sits in the ashes
you didnt have the faintest idea what you were doing did you
youre a fool and im a bigger one for bringing you here
she snatches up a pitchfork and glowers at him
i dont want you in this house
but galen still sits there like a puppet with its strings cut every dream of glory utterly crushed
this piteous sight touches valerians heart
her gaze softens
she slowly lowers the pitchfork
a knot of villagers lead tyrian and his henchmen across the square directly to the blacksmiths shop
the kings men dismount and pound on the door
it swings open
valerian is standing there
where is he
i cant help you
a cry goes up from the villagers
they know damn well hes in there
tyrian pushes valerian aside and steps into the room
aided by some townfolk his men proceed to ransack the premises overturning barrels sticking their swords through flour sacks poking through the tumbledown thatch
valerians eye falls on malkin who has involved himself in the search
returning her look damn right
finding nothing the group pushes into the metal shop where simon is hammering an iron wheel rim back into shape on an enormous anvil
he lays down his tools and grimly watches the men go through overturning benches and tables
tyrian props a leg up on the anvil and addresses himself to simon
as the proud new father of an eligible daughter who was some how overlooked all these years it may interest you to know that the king has called for a
but its months til the solstice
in view of whats happened we all know whats required
ive never taken part in your cursed lottery and ill have nothing to do with it now
you were very clever
but shell take part like all the rest
the search party has exhausted the rooms hiding places
if he was here hes gone now
tyrian nods and leads the way out
simon catches up and pulls tyrian aside at the door
i know what you want
are you offering me a bribe
dont waste your time
pause you could never afford it
he spins on his heel and joins his men as they ride out of town
valerian and simon watch them go
when the riders are out of sight they return to the shop
with a couple of stout poles they strain to lift the anvil off its base
finally it topples over
valerian slides the base aside revealing a trap door
she raises it and a cramped galen unfolds himself from the space below
on his face is a curious look of determination
smith have you ever forged a weapon
simon is going through a cabinet tossing out hoes rakes sickles scythes plow blades and a knife or two
galen examines them doubtfully
now simon produces an armload of swords
galen is impressed he looks them over carefully testing and rejecting them in turn
these are your sharpest
simon plucks up one of the swords carries it to the center of the room
he lays a horseshoe on the anvil
he brings the sword down whack
and cuts the horseshoe in half
even tyrian carries one of these
galen hefts it dubiously
its sharp but its not sharp enough
valerian has been watching all this with growing concern
not sharp enough for what
for what im going to do with it
nothings that sharp
simon gnaws his lip
reluctantly he brings a long box from the bottom of the cabinet
he opens it
lying on a bed of silk is an exquisite two handed broadsword
the flat blade gleams like a mirror
galen reaches in and lifts it out
the best i ever made
valerian is as awed as galen
galen brings up a finger to test the edge
simon grabs his hand away
dont do that
he looks at valerian girl child when you were born i knew i had to do something so i set about the task of fashioning an extraordinary weapon i had
the skill to make it bleak pause but not the nerve to use it
she looks at him with affection
leaning forward she plants a kiss on his bald pate
im thankful for that
to galen no man should choose a senseless death
galen valerian and simon tramp through a glade to a mossy bank
there a wide stream flows lazily under a canopy of trees
if its me youre worried about dont
so my name has been entered what of it
there are hundreds of girls
my name just wont be drawn
i know it wont
galen walks out into the shallows and pushes the sword tip into the sandy bottom angled so that the edge splits the current
valerian this isnt just for your sake
he walks back to shore
all three watch the sword to see what will happen
big flat oak leaves are gliding along the current
very slowly they go by the sword some of them very close
finally one of them floats against the leading edge of the blade and without a ripple is cleft in two
simon gives galen a significant look
i dont care
it doesnt matter
what you want to kill isnt flesh and blood
oh itll bleed all right
how do you know
no ones so much as even scratched it
they look to galen
the apprentices face is full of doubt
ill need the amulet
carrying torches to light their way families some with maiden daughters gather from all over the country in the courtyard of the kings castle
simon is there with valerian and so is galen disguised in rough farm clothes and a wide brimmed hat
like many others he carries a stick topped with a bleached skull to all appearances just another participant in this weird pagan ritual
a barrel decorated with flames and dragons wings sits on a raised dais in front of the main entrance
horsrik the kings herald supervises preparations for the lottery
armed guards appear carrying a sealed chest
horsrik breaks the seal and the guards pour the contents hundreds of wooden tiles each bearing the name of a potential sacrifice into the barrel
trumpets blare and drums roll and the royal party strolls onstage the king his daughter courtiers and tyrian
valerian nudges galen
pointing look at her
valerian gives galen a sharp look
horsrik unrolls a parchment
reading people of urland whereas the peace of the kingdom has been disrupted by the mischief of an interloper and whereas this interloper being fled now therefore his majesty the
king hereby proclaims the sum of thirty ducats to be paid to anyone producing the miscreant galen bradwardyn fraud enchanter to our satisfaction
galen pulls his hat low over his eyes
as the moment for the drawing approaches valerian becomes more and more uneasy
she pushes forward through the crowd until shes just below the barrel
she eyes the people around her
some of them seem equally worried others the better dressed and better fed are smug and complacent
the king and his retinue are serene
a chant goes up from the crowd stir the tiles
stir the tiles
horsrik picks up a wooden staff surmounted by a carved dragons head and stirs up the names
this done a new chant goes up bare the arm
bare the arm
at a signal a guard comes forward and cuts the sleeve from horsriks right arm
he holds it high
the crowd surges forward
the atmosphere is full of dread and excitement
valerian looking pale and determined is jostled and pushed to the edge of the platform
draw the name
draw the name
the moment has come
down goes horsriks arm and up it comes holding one little wooden square one young womans fate
an expectant hush falls over the mob
the virgins of urland tremble and wait
now my countrymen hear me behold for i am chosen
i shall die that many may live
i shall lay down my life for family and fellows
i shall go to my grave for the love of our king and his wise policy
and my name is he looks down at the tile to read the name but no sound comes to his lips
he looks back at the crowd a cold sweat breaking over his face
he swallows but still cant bring himself to speak
at his feet valerian is holding her breath
a new chant goes up
by now horsrik is trembling
he stares down at the tile his mouth set in a grim line
the king is getting annoyed
he gestures and the crowd falls silent
read the name
mastering himself the name is princess elspeth ulfilas filia regis
there is a moment of profound shock
then a low murmur of wonder moves through the crowd
galen looks at valerian she sags with relief
the king turns to his daughter
she shows nothing
he rises from his chair comes forward and snatches the tile from horsrik
thats not the name
its been misread
valerian will not stand for such hypocrisy
theres no mistake
the names been chosen let it stand
no the good horsrik has misspoke himself
he looks at the tile in fairness to this individual whose name i cant make out well destroy this tile
he quickly tosses the wood chip into a brazier at his elbow
led by valerian the crowd cries out in protest
what better name than your own kin
at last we see justice done
we will have a new choosing
i will draw the name myself
he reaches into the barrel and extracts another tile
he looks at it and his eyes widen
betrayed he swivels to face his daughter
the din of the crowd reaches a crescendo
let it stand
let it stand
elspeth takes the tile from her fathers nerveless fingers looks at it with satisfaction and holds it aloft
the name is as you heard it and as horsrik read it elspeth
the king moils through the tiles finding his daughters name again and again
the lottery is invalid
another and another
what treachery is this
valerian chanting with the rest falls silent
she looks at elspeth with sudden interest and respect then awe
hear me good people
it is true that my name appears on many of the lots
this does not falsify the drawing it certifies it
i have learned that my name has been kept from jeopardy in all the drawings in the past
so i have put my name among the rest many times once for each risk that over the years you took and i did not
the crowd is dumbfounded
gradually voices erupt in a cacophony of shouts whistles and excited conversation
galen sees his chance theres an unguarded door near the stable
he drifts toward it and slips inside
galen pokes his head in the room is empty
he scurries over to a chest flings it open and starts rummaging
finding nothing he moves on to a cabinet
he breaks the lock and pries it open
galen can hear the voices in the courtyard as he rushes down a hall
suddenly he stops short
there in front of him is a guard leaning out a window to watch the proceedings
galen hovers on the verge of panic as the guard abruptly moves
but the man is only headed for another window and a better view
galen manages to fall into step an arms length behind him and slip by without a sound
galen enters the library his enormous shadow dancing crazily on the torchlit walls
hurrying through his attention is drawn to some open books on a table
closer inspection reveals magical writings and symbols
galen paws over everything suddenly aware that he must be close to the amulet
but where is it
as the crowd disperses valerian watches elspeth walk back in the castle lofty and composed
she looks for galen and discovers he has gone
by now the room is in total disarray
galen has opened all the chests and trunks and knocked half the books from the shelves
hes feverishly working on a locked drawer when a voice interrupts him
dont go to all that trouble
galen whirls around to find the king standing in the doorway
the monarch looks shattered
galen edges toward the split in the wall and finds that it has been shored up with timbers
at that moment tyrian comes through the door sizes up the situation and draws his sword
if you want a fight at least give me a weapon
pushing by the king i think not
dont harm him
to galen and you dont run away
the kings voice is cracking
galen and tyrian are equally taken aback
the king searches through the books remaining on the library shelves
shaky ive always had the greatest admiration for the black arts
you chaps with your mysterious spells
i didnt think it would be necessary you see
vermithrax is an old dragon
and that i thought was the beauty of my plan buying time
wed wait her out
id live to see the end of her
firm thats still going to happen
the king finds the book and takes the amulet out
with trembling hands he passes it to galen
he shall have it
pleading its my daughter
save her i beg you
the people of swanscombe are clearing up the rubble and beginning repairs on their dwellings
standing in their midst lecturing every passerby is greil
he holds up the charred remains of brother jacopus wooden cross
holy of holies he did not die in vain
can you hear me brothers
some workmen go by lugging new thatch
malkin is with them
gently we hear you greil
well and good but im greil no longer
call me gregorius after the bishop of rome
malkin and the others stop to listen
i saw him die
like our lord jesus on the cross he was scourged by evil
but he showed no fear
such is the power of the holy ghost
galen lurks in the shadows of simons metal shop looking out on the square where greil is holding forth
of what avail is magic
the old gods died with our daughters
from whence comest my help
my help comest from the lord
galen quietly shuts and bars the door
he moves deeper into the gloomy workroom where simon is pumping a bellows to heat up the forge
galen looks at the coals
good and hot
thats not the kind of fire we need
valerian is staring at the sword sitting on the anvil in its silk wrapping
galen uncovers it holds it high and puts his hand on the amulet
nunc per potestatem hermeticum ex flammis ferrum sangrinarium
the sword starts to hum and to heat up
from the hilt outward the blade glows brighter and brighter red orange white
it lights up the room throwing long shadows into the corners
galen lays the white hot steel on the anvil
simon takes up his hammer and begins the reforging
valerian sees their resolve
after watching for several moments she slips out the side door looking sad
clouds scud low over the lifeless region
the dragons lair now has a newer bigger entrance
vapors drift upward from it
down the slope a lonely figure works its way from rock to rock its valerian with a wicker basket on her arm searching for dragon scales
the basket is already more than half full when she finds herself ominously near the mouth of the cavern
shes about to turn back when she spies a particularly large and beautiful scale just a few yards further on
as she reaches for it there is a sudden hiss
she jerks her hand back and freezes
there in the shadows is a baby dragon a basilisk all coppery bronze with stubby winglets
as she backs away she sees two more come up to join the first
they watch her retreat through wicked little green eyes
on the mossy bank galen and simon unwrap the reforged sword
now the blade carries a faint blue halation
galen walks to the middle of the current and once again stabs the tip down into the sand
then he rejoins simon onshore to await results
this time as the oak leaves approach the sharp edge they gently but definitely veer sideways to avoid contact
such is the power of the sword that even after many leaves not a single one has come close enough to be sliced
simon is agog and even galen seems satisfied
they clasp hands
an edge like no other on this earth
well done simon
simon hands him a bundle of fighting equipment
grave ill say goodbye to valerian for you
im sorry shes not here but you know how she is
they look at each other for what could be the last time
fare thee well
the old man departs
galen unfolds the bundle and brings out its contents mail hauberk with coif studded leather gloves padded jerkin a scabbard and a small wooden shield
he lays them out on the stream bank then strips off his tunic and kneels down to splash some water in his face
as the cups the water between his hands an image comes alive and shimmers on the surface valerian stripping off her own clothes shyly turning toward him solemn and romantic
its as if the vision is speaking to him but its not
he spins around and sees her standing there fully clothed and possessed of a brisk and businesslike air
she throws down a shield
its remarkable in its construction overlapping layers of iridescent dragon scales have been ingeniously fastened to a leather clad frame
its a shield
i made it
might keep the fire off you
you know youre an idiot
youre going to die tonight
youll be ripped limb from limb
this is the last time ill ever speak to you
galen turns the shield over and over marveling at it
he fixes her with a piercing look
rushing another thing
that thing isnt alone up there
theres little ones
young i think
i dont know how many
galens eyes are still fastened on her
shes fighting to retain her hard manner but the agitation and dread are plain
theyll have to be killed too
valerian wants to be bold but on this final point cant muster the courage
tiny voice youre in love arent you
slowly nodding yes
thats all right
shes very beautiful very brave
what do you mean
but i dont care
it doesnt change the way i feel
firm listen to me galen bradwardyn sorcerers apprentice youre going to be dead the dragon will be worse than ever there will be more lotteries and im not a boy
and youll be eligible because because im still a virgin and i want you to do something about it
galen takes her in his arms she is trembling
he tilts her face up toward his and kisses her
i am in love
but not with the princess
their image is reflected in the waters
through the ripples she is visible pulling briefly away to remove her clothes
from afar they are two tiny figures under the overarching oaks and willows
they embrace and sink down into the deep grass beside the water
the leaves continue their unhurried course downstream
a cold wind whistles through the rocks near the dragons lair
by the light of a flickering torch two workmen finish driving a heavy post into the ground
as they affix a pair of iron manacles they see the torches of a procession coming up the slope
they hurry down to meet it
horsrik is in the lead followed by soldiers and royal attendants
elspeth rides in the tumbril behind a blindfolded horse
bringing up the rear is tyrian
at last the cart can go no further
elspeth alights and leads the rest of the troop to the post
as the soldiers put the irons around her wrists horsrik unrolls a parchment turns his back on the wind and begins to read now be it known throughout the kingdom
that the princess having been chosen by a deed of fortune and destiny horsrik blinks
theres a black stain growing in the middle of the parchment all at once it bursts into flames
he cries out and flings the document away
there follows a flash of light and a puff of smoke and galen is standing there as if he had materialized out of thin air
horsrik and his startled men backpedal down the slope
no fire i beg you
galen raises his hands in a menacing gesture
thats enough for horsrik and company he and the soldiers depart
over his shoulder i declare these proceedings duly ordained
only one man remains behind the challenge the young sorcerer tyrian
he draws his sword
i knew id find you here
well im not as sentimental as some
the kingdom every one of us need this sacrifice
if you intend to interfere youll have to kill me
ive got plenty of reasons to kill you that have nothing to do with this sacrifice
galen draws his own sword
as it emerges into the night air it seems imbued with a blue phosphorescence
can you use it
elspeth twists around in her chains
let it be
tyrian is right its our only hope
galen starts to reply but as soon as his attention wavers tyrian is lunging toward him sword point directed at his neck
galen barely manages to parry the thrust before tyrian is at him again blade swinging toward his knees
galen drops the tip of his sword to catch the blow
when the two steel edges connect sparks fly
in a series of thrusts and counter thrusts each accompanied by a shower of sparks tyrian backs galen up the mountain
tyrian both of you run
sure enough at that moment the earth gives out a low moan and undulates in a sickening movement
vapors begin rising from the lair
in a trice
this is no swords man
he might be right for galen turns and bolts across the slope
when he reaches the post with tyrian two steps behind he whirls and brings his blade down on princess elspeths chains
the chains part in an explosion of sparks
get out of here
the princess darts from the piling as tyrian swoops down to continue the attack
galen dodges and the stake catches tyrians blow
the earth shakes again
galen glances at the princess
what are you doing
elspeth is not running away down the mountain
instead she is walking slowly and deliberately right into the smoking cave
tyrians sword comes down again
the dismayed sorcerer ducks back and tyrians blade again bites deep into the wood
youve failed my friend and i thank the gods for it
come out from behind that post
its now or never
elspeth is no longer in sight
galen grits his teeth grasps the sword with two hands and swings it as hard as he can in a wide arc
the blade never even slows down as it sails right through the post lopping it clean off
the glowing sword flashes above galens head and eagerly buries itself in tyrians chest
the kings man is as startled by the amputated piling as he is by his own death
his eyes roll up in his head his knees buckle and he topples backward the blade sliding free
smoke swirls at the mouth of the cave as galen enters holding his sword before him lighting his way with its faint blue glow
the floor of the cave as it winds down into the mountain is paved first with rock then with dragon scales then with bones
with each footfall clusters of mysterious insects scuttle away
galen pauses to mop his brow its getting hot
a sound echoes up from the depths a grinding sound like the gnashing of teeth followed by hissing and squealing
galen grips his sword tighter and pushes on
suddenly he stoops and picks up an embroidered slipper elspeths
the grinding sounds are louder
he hurries forward and rounds a corner
he stops and gags
two disgusting little reptiles like scaly raccoons are perched on the corpse of princess elspeth ulfilas feeding contentiously on choice bits of the royal flesh
galen groans he lashes out and his sword beheads one of the tiny monsters
the other one buzzes its half formed winglets and hisses a hot stream of air
galen brings down the sword and slices it in half
eyes riveted on elspeths remains he edges around the carnage and backs away
theres a third one lurking in the shadows munching on something it might be a hand
galen shrieks and jumps away
the little creature comes at him and clamps its jaws on his leg
galen stabs at it repeatedly
finally it lets go and flails and flops across the bloody floor ululating its death agony
as the creatures last mewlings echo down through the cavern the ground quivers
bits of stone fall from the ceiling
galen works his way down a narrow passage whose walls are alive with insects and beads of sulphurous water
as before he holds the sword in front of him he marvels at its increasing brightness
the heat is increasing too sweat mats his hair and runs down his face
a few yards further on the sword starts pulsating
now the walls take on a flickering rosy sheen and the passage widens into an underground vista of staggering immensity an underground lake its surface bubbling and torn with sheets
arching over it is a vault of stone penetrated here and there by natural chimneys
the dimensions of this internal world are unknown the fiery lake disappears into half a dozen side chambers
the one clear path is accessible only by a series of flat stones leading across the hot liquid
galen grips his sword and resolutely hops from rock to rock
hes halfway across when the earth rumbles and the stepping stones teeter beneath his feet
a fiery wave washes over his legs leaving his boots smoking
another tremor knocks galen to his knees
as he scrabbles to pick up his sword and shield the great head of vermithrax rises up out of the depths on its long neck
it gazes at him through huge pale eyes under armored lids
a tongue flicks out and runs around its lipless mouth
the head sways from side to side
the mouth hinges open the nostril like igniters come on and touch off the jet of gas squeezed up out of its innards
a roaring tube of flame engulfs galen
he crouches behind his dragon scale shield which deflects the fire just enough to save his life
the dragon pauses to take a breath
galen springs to his feet and bounds back the way he came his skin and clothing singed
flames lick at his back as the dragon lets fly with a second burst
coughing and weeping galen staggers up through the tunnel nearly tripping over the body of one of the baby dragons
a few seconds later vermithrax follows squirming and clawing its way upward
when it reaches its dead offspring it surveys the scene with expressionless eyes
bringing its head low it sniffs and nudges at the lifeless little ones
at that moment galen leaps out from behind a niche in the tunnel wall and lunges forward
striking sparks the point of his sword slides across the dragons plated cheek and stabs deep between the scales of its heavy neck
there is an unearthly shriek and the creature flicks its head back and upward
galen goes sprawling and finds himself holding half a sword
the rest is buried in the beasts neck and vermithrax doesnt like it
it flings its head this way and that knocking rocks loose from the ceiling
its movements cause the ground to quake
as boulders tumble around him galen drops to the floor under his shield
dragon flame reaches through the cascading debris and washes over him
valerian roams the rock strewn slope not far from the dragons lair
presently she comes upon a once familiar object the fire shield
half the scales are gone the rest are charred and curling
grimly she moves on
a few paces away she picks up the blunted sword
she scans the rocks and finally sees what shes looking for
hes lying face down behind a boulder his clothes charred patches of skin scorched
he looks dead
valerian rolls him onto his back
she gasps the eyes are open regarding her
simon is standing by the anvil with the broken sword in his hand lost in thought
in the adjoining house valerian tends galens wounds
hes propped up on a palette enduring the application of poultices
you know what we have to do
he looks at her with dull eyes we have to leave urland
he winces in pain
not because of what happened
i brought you here it didnt work now im taking you away
do you understand
galen does not react you said you loved me
is it true
if it is its the only good weve done
lets not lose that too
he seems miles away
she turns aside on the verge of tears
simon is standing there still holding the sword hilt
what kind of a life could you have here
its too late for me but youre young enough
he shows them the sword you know what i think
magic is dying out fading from the world
but that makes me happy
that means the dragon will be dying too
galen looks at him he has heard everything
he sits up and fondly regards valerian
valerian packs her belongings into a rucksack
the last item in is her blue frock carefully rolled
beside her galen dons clean traveling clothes
he stiffly crosses the room and drags his pack out of the corner
he sorts through the effects and amidst the clothing and supplies discovers the leather pouch containing ulrichs remains
he contemplates it
i was just thinking poor hodge
he tucks the pouch away throws some clothes on top and ties the satchel shut
beside the quiet stream simon bids farewell to the young couple embracing each in turn
they slosh across the shallow water and follow a path into the woods
greil is standing outside the half burned grange hall summoning the christian faithful
he proclaims the call to worship by hammering on a small bell
one by one the townsfolk arrive
among them is simon looking bereft
valerian and galen trudge along side by side
hows your leg
that thing was small but its teeth were sharp
at least you killed it
you got all the young
this is small consolation and galen sighs
but the big ones alive
somewhere down in that burning lake
dont think about it
you had your fight and youre still here
thats more than anyone else can say
lets think about what lies ahead
she reaches out to take his hand
but galen is no longer at her side
she stops and looks back
galen has come to a halt in the middle of the path
hes staring into the middle distance with a sudden inspiration bubbling in his brain
he flings off his sack drops to his knees and tears through the contents
valerian comes back baffled
galens gear is strewn all over the trail
what are you doing
galen comes up with what hes looking for the leather sack
when he replies it is not to her but to ulrich you old trickster
the burning water
the lake of fire
galen what are you saying
he regards her with astonishment
he had it planned
he knew this was going to happen
weve got to go back i want to talk to him
he heads back down the trail leaving his belongings on the road
where are you going
she hurries after him
gregorious stands in the center of the burned out granary delivering a sermon
behind him men are filling the baptismal cistern
the church is mother to us all
not just one lonely orphan who has lost his way not just a few but all of us that believeth in him
when enough voices come together in prayer he shall hear we shall live and the beast shall die
in the gathering simon ponders the hilt of his once fabulous sword
with its blade shortened it looks a lot like a crucifix
galen bounds up the rocky slope as fast as he can manage trailed by a desperate valerian
please i beg you
but galen pays no attention
in a burst of speed and fury valerian comes up behind and tackles him
i wont let you kill yourself
galen waves the leather pouch in valerians face
he couldnt walk he knew he couldnt make the journey
so he had us make the journey for him
dont you see
he jumps up and runs to the mouth of the lair
she tackles him again
all right all right
youre going in there im going too
brought up short what
no youre not this is my job
but valerian springs to her feet and starts into the lair
im not afraid
and youre not going to stop me
after all ive been a man longer than you have
galen pauses long enough to snatch up a discarded torch near the remains of the wooden stake then charges after her
running footsteps resound in the steamy passageway and galen comes around the corner holding his torch high to light the way
valerian stumbles after him
he grabs her hand
down and down they go
soon they reach elspeths body
but she pulls the torch from his hand and goes over to see
he darts off
in the flickering torchlight valerian can see the princess remains all too clearly
she suppresses a scream
where are you
the torch reveals several passages
she doesnt know which one to take
the passage widens out and once again galen is standing on the shores of the lake of fire
he looks around
the water is rolling with bubbles of gas and flames run hither and yon across the surface but there is no sign of the dragon
gathering his courage he hops across the stepping stones to the middle of the lake
there he hurriedly opens the pouch
ex favilla vita nova
gripping the amulet with his free hand he scatters ulrichs ashes in a wide arc over the burning water
instantly there is an ominous rumble and the earth gives a shrug
but no wizard appears
no dragon either
there follows another and stronger quake
galen crouches to keep his balance
still no wizard
thoroughly bewildered valerian stumbles out into daylight
she wanders a few yards down the slope and collapses against the stake
something is strange its getting dark
squinting up at the sun she frowns in puzzlement then gapes at what is happening
slowly and ponderously the black disk of the moon slides over the face of the sun plunging the world into crepuscular half light
the congregation is confused and frightened by the sudden darkness
he watcheth over us
and this is his sign
let us pray
our father who art in heaven
the faithful bow their heads and join in
simon as well
the earthquakes have subsided the water is calm
galen stares bleakly into the flames
as he watches they gather themselves into a lazy spiral
gradually the spiral speeds up and becomes a vortex
now the flames become tinged with green and as the cavern moans with the sound of rushing air a form takes shape at the crest of a jet of flame
it is ulrich supine as upon his pyre reforming before galens eyes
i can see you
looks at him not so loud
im not deaf you know
he slowly raises himself into an upright posture and strides through the flames
sic redit magus ex terra mortis
the apprentice throws himself at his masters feet
wonder of wonders youre back
i thank the powers that made me
glad to see you too
you didnt bring along anything to eat by any chance
oh well no time anyway
valerian is standing in the unearthly twilight anxiously peering into the mouth of the lair
suddenly she is hit from behind by a gust of wind
she does not turn to see the enormous vermithrax alighting silently behind her
ulrich raises galen to his feet
theres much to be done
wait i have something to tell you
it can wait
no it cant
listen i thought i was a sorcerer but i wasnt
i thought i had power but i didnt
i thought i was you but im not
he hangs his head
ulrich regards him steadily
he leads the way across the rocks to the shore and into the tunnel
time seems to have come to a stop
overhead the moon is locked in front of the sun
at the lair valerian stands frozen as the dragon leans over her
the great head sways from side to side
the jaws hinge open
suddenly valerian recovers herself and makes a run for it leaping and scrabbling over the rocks
a plume of flame licks at her heels
she sees a protective crevice and heads for it but a winged claw drops to block her way
she changes direction and is cut off again
cat and mouse
the pale yellow eyes stare implacably down at the hopeless victim
the igniter jets come on then off as the beast suddenly stiffens
the head rotates almost as if catching a new scent
finally the eyes focus on the entrance to the cavern
there is the sorcerer leaning on galen coolly regarding the creature
the old mans expression hardens
the dragon lifts its wings as if to menace them then flaps twice and is airborne
the thing shoots overhead and with a rush of wind flies off into the gloom
valerian struggles out of her hiding place
galen runs to her
when they look up ulrich is at their side
wheres my amulet
give it to me please
galens hand locates the jewel under his shirt
he finds himself reluctant to part with it
with a hurricane howl a column of flame touches down nearby and rushes toward them
they stagger back as the dragon sweeps past
galen hands his treasure over
ulrich closes his hand around it
come close to me
galen and valerian approach
the old mans hand is suffused with an internal glow
behind them the dragon is turning for another pass
all at once the glow brightens and in another instant the world spins off into a blur setting all three afloat in a timeless netherworld
valerian and galen cling to each other in terror
dont be afraid
you have served me with great courage
now you must show me you have even more
the voices seem to be coming from a huge distance
starlike gleams whiz by and fleeting glimpses of half recognizable faces and forms
the wizards eyes are like glittering crystals
tiny motes and planetoids dance in the hairs of his beard
he seems wreathed in luminescence
you must destroy the amulet and me along with it
you brought me from the flames you must send me back
when the time comes youll understand
he dangles the amulet in front of galen
even more reluctantly than he let it go he takes it back
abruptly the vortex is gone and they find themselves atop a rocky crag overlooking the eclipse darkened fields and farms of urland
galen glances at his surroundings and stares at the amulet full of awe
i know what youre thinking
you have learned much and done well
dont worry you wont need it any more
greil is urging simon the last of the converts into the cistern
make haste brother
he dips simons head under water
now be thou baptized in the name of the father son and holy ghost
may the lord our god light our way
in the background half the congregation is staring through the burned out walls fervently praying and crossing themselves wondering if theyll ever see the sun again
a cry goes up a shape crosses the solar corona wheels over the village and streaks away toward the mountains the dragon
galen and valerian peer out from behind a boulder and watch ulrich hobble perilously close to the edge of the cliff
the old man spreads wide his arms and tilts his head back
from over the horizon roiling inky black clouds churn down upon them
thunder booms and echoes
a bitter wind whips their clothing
as the storm gathers fury the dragon reappears circling in the distance
finally it homes in on the mountain crag and dives at ulrich
the conjurer makes a gesture and strokes of lightning explode against the beasts scaly flanks
it emits a high thin scream and rockets past
valerian crawls away and comes back with a hefty chunk of granite
do as he said
not if it means killing him
he resolutely waits as the dragon banks against the clouds and starts another pass
again the sorcerer summons lightning bolts
but the dragon keeps coming this time a talon splits the old mans cape
valerian wrestles the amulet away from galen
it falls to the ground
you heard what he said
she lifts the chunk of stone
galen grabs for it
vermithrax spirals up into the storm then drops earthward
ulrich watches as the beast comes straight at him
he folds his arms and bows his head
leathery wings humming the creature levels out swoops up past the crag and lifts the master magician away in its huge hind claw
galen and valerian are horrified to see the dragon circling upward with the sorcerer writhing in agony in its grip
as the monstrous thing flies high over them they can hear ulrichs faint screams
now galen understands
he seizes the granite block from valerian and raises it with both hands over his head
he takes a final look at the amulet glowing at his feet then brings the rock down with all his might
there is a blinding flash as it shatters into a million fragments
far above there is another blinding flash as ulrichs earthly body explodes against the belly of the beast
the darkened sky lights up as huge gouts of flame spew forth from the dragons gut
wings fluttering uselessly this reptilian torch plummets to the ground
below a stock pond nestled in the foothill pastures
trailing a wake of flame vermithrax plunges like a comet into the water
there is a stupendous splash and eruption of steam
they stare down from their lofty perch watching as further explosions boil the water from the pond
behind a tattered wrack of cloud the moon slowly uncovers a pale sun
grey misty light reveals the beasts mangled remains
galen and valerian emerge from the fog walk under a blackened wing and make their way through the mud and loose scales to the huge charred head
the death agony has twisted it upside down
the mouth is frozen in a grotesque look of surprise
the eyes are glazed
now the sound of voices floats toward them chanting an ancient hymn
a moment later a mob of christians led by greil crests a hill and moves toward the hulk
the song ends
let us pray
the members of the congregation fall to their knees
we thank thee lord for this divine deliverance
verily is thy presence amongst us fully manifest in this thy great work
galen and valerian look at each other
she takes his hand
arise children of the lord and forsake evermore the pagan mysteries
rejoice in the true power of the christian god
galen turns and leads valerian away
they disappear into the mist
in the clear light of a new day ladders have been tipped up against the creatures back
teams of men swarm over the crusted flesh slicing off long strips for piecemeal burial
below yoked oxen drag the heavy carrion away on sledges
in the background other workmen dump the remains into an open pit
with the crack of a whip and the clatter of hooves the royal coach pulls up to the shore of the lake
a door creaks open and king casiodorus totters out
his face is puffy his eyes are red
he slogs through the mud to the head of the dragon and commences hacking at it with a ceremonial sword
horsrik steps out of the coach and draws himself up
loud all hail casiodorus rex dragon slayer
the workers pause long enough to listen to this pronouncement and cast a glance at the sorry spectacle
wordlessly they resume their labors
nodding hail and praise be
the trail leads through copses and open meadows
side by side galen and valerian march up a long slope under a hot sun
he limps a bit she finds a staff and hands it to him
you want to rest
you miss ulricn
and the amulet
im glad its gone
im glad you did what you did
he doesnt reply you may not be a sorcerer galen but i love you anyway
i dont regret anything that happened
i just wish yes
sighs that we had a horse
galen falls a step behind
he briefly closes his eyes and mutters something
they walk on a few paces
then there is a whinny from the nearby woods and a white stallion canters forth
it crosses a meadow comes right up to valerian and nuzzles her
what is this
it must have been wandering loose
galen climbs aboard
he reaches out to help her up
wait a minute
i just wished for a horse and here it is
you dont want to wish it gone do you
she thinks for a moment then lets him help her up
galen touches the horses flanks with his heels and they ride off
