ghostbusters ii by harold ramis and dan aykroyd september last revised feburary a high aerial shot of the island features the statue of liberty prominently in the foreground then travels
across the harbor over the battery and lower manhattan to greenwich village
a car is being hoisted up by a municipal tow truck while its owner is having a terrible screaming arguement with a parking enforcement officer
dana barrett comes home pushing a baby buggy struggling with two full bags of groceries and trying to dig her keys out of her purse
the building superintendent frank sees her struggling but pretends not to notice
exasperated frank do you think you could give me a hand with these bags
im not a doorman miss barrett
im a building superintendent
youre also a human being frank
reluctantly going to help okay okay
its not my job but what the hell
ill do you a favor
he takes the grocery bags from her
setting the wheel brakes on the buggy thank you frank
ill get the hang of this eventually
she continues digging in her purse while frank leans over the buggy and makes funny faces at the baby oscar a very cute nine month old boy
to the baby hiya oscar
what do you say slugger
to dana thats a good looking kid you got there ms
finding her keys thank you frank
oh are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom
i asked you last week
didnt i do it
it starts to vibrate as if shaken by an unseen hand
he gurgles with delight at the movement
neither of them notice the movement of the carriage
no you didnt frank
okay thats no problem
thats exactly what you said last week
the brakes unlock themselves
she reaches for the handlebar of the buggy but the buggy rolls forward just out of her reach and stops
surprised by the movement she reaches for the handlebar again but this time the buggy rolls away even further
alarmed now dana hurries after it but the buggy keeps rolling down the street at ever increasing speed
dana chases the buggy down the street shouting to passing pedestrians for help but every time someone reaches out to stop it the buggy swerves and continues unchecked
cars trucks and buses speed by in both directions as the buggy races toward the corner
she puts her head down and sprints after the buggy like an olympian
a city bus is on a collision course with the speeding baby buggy
it careens toward the corner
its eyes are wide open with excitement
bus and buggy are closing fast as the buggy bounces over the curb and into the crosswalk
the bus driver reacts in helpless horror as he sees the buggy enter the intersection at high speed
it comes to a dead stop right in the middle of the street
the bus continues missing the buggy by inches
cars and trucks swerve and hit their brakes as dana runs into the intersection and snatches up the baby
she hugs it close deeply relieved then looks at the buggy with the dawning awareness that the supernatural has re entered her life
theme music kicks in strongly as we see the familiar no ghosts symbol and pull back to reveal that its painted on the side of ecto the ghostbusters emergency vehicle
which is speeding up broadway on the upper west side
ray stantz is driving and winston zeddemore is riding shotgun
the ectomobile pulls up in front of a carefully restored brownstone
stantz and winston wearing their official ghostbuster uniforms jump out of the old ambulance shoulder their proton packs and enter the house
a woman greets them and leads them through the expensively furnished house
all business how many of them are there maam
theyre in the back
i hope you can handle them
its been like a nightmare
how big are they
she holds her hand out indicating about four feet
resolute well do our best maam
theyre right out here
she leads them to a set of french doors that open into another room
stantz and winston pause to make final adjustments to their equipment
then lets do it
he pushes through the french doors and they step into the room
they are immediately attacked by fourteen or fifteen screaming kids between the ages of seven and ten
tables are set with party favors ice cream and birthday cake and the room is strewn with discarded toys and games
a couple of weary parents sink onto lawn chairs as stantz and winston take over the party
trying his best how you doin kids
nasty i though we were having he man
he man couldnt make it today
thats why were here
my dad says youre full of crap
stopped cold well a lot of people have trouble believing in the paranormal
no he just says youre full of crap and thats why you went out of business
he kicks stantz in the leg
stantz grabs him by the shirtfront
low and menacing im watching you
to winston song
winston switches on a tiny tape recorder which starts playing the ghostbusters theme song
stantz and winston start singing theres something wrong in the neighborhood
who you gonna call
all together he man
stantz and winston wearily load their equipment into the ectomobile
thats it ray
ive had it
no more parties
im tired of taking abuse from over privileged nine year olds
come on winston
we cant quit now
the holidays are coming up
its our best season
they get in the car stantz tries to start the car but the engine wont turn over
give it up ray
youre living in the past
ghostbusters doesnt exist anymore
in a year these kids wont even remember who we are
tries to start the car again ungrateful little yuppie larvae
after all we did for this city
yeah what did we do ray
the last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise
yeah but what a ride
you cant make a hamburger without chopping up a cow
he turns the key again the enging turns over then starts grinding and clunking disastrously chewing up vital parts and dropping twisted bits of metal onto the pavement
finally with a blast of black sooty exhaust from the tailpipe ecto shudders and dies
frustrated stantz bangs his head lightly on the steering wheel a bank of monitors in the lobby show the program now running on wkrr channel in new york
we push in on one of the monitors as a title card and logo come up accompanied by some eerie synthesizer music and we return to the show in progress
world of the psychic with dr
there is a video dissolve to a standard talk show set and sitting there is our host peter venkman the renowned and somewhat infamous ex ghostbuster
he turns to camera and talks to his viewers in a suavely engaging tone understated and intimate
hi welcome back to the world of the psychic im peter venkman and im chatting with my guest author lecturer and of course psychic milton anglund
to his guest milt your new book is called the end of the world
isnt that kind of like writing about gum disease
yes it could happen but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it
well i think its important for people to know that the world is in danger
okay so can you tell us when its going to happen or do we have to buy the book
i predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on new years eve
thats cutting it a little close isnt it
i mean just from a sales point of view the book just came out right
so youre not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year
and its going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie of the week or mini series potential
you would have been better off predicting or even just to be safe
irritated this is not just some money making scheme
i didnt just make up the date
i have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on new years eve
placating well for your sake i hope youre right
but i think my other guest may disagree with you
elaine you had another date in mind
the camera reveals elaine an attractive aggressive new jersey housewife sitting on the other side of venkman
according to my sources the world will end on february in the year
thats got to be a bummer
where did you get that date elaine
i received this information from an alien
i was at the paramus holiday inn i was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking
then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and thats where he told me about
the end of the world
your alien had a room in the holiday inn
it may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the holiday inn
i cant be sure peter
humoring her no you cant and i think thats the whole problem with aliens you just cant trust them
you may get some nice ones occasionally like starman or e
but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard
anyway were just about out of time
does his wrap up right to the camera next week on world of the psychic hairless pets
holds up a hairless cat until then this is peter venkman saying
puts a finger to his temple and sends out a though to his viewers good night
venkman comes out of the studio squabbling with his producer norman a well meaning young incompetent
where do you find these people
i thought we were having the telekinetic guy who bends the spoons
a lot of the better psychics wont come on the show
they think youre too skeptical
norman im a pushover
i think professional wrestling is real
there is a small commotion down the hall as two plainclothes cops come out of the next studio followed by a group of mayoral assistants
to norman whats all this
they just interviewed the mayor on cityline
hes a friend of mine
venkman starts down the hall as the mayor and his principal aide jack hardemeyer come walking out of the studio
calling to the mayor lenny
the mayor sees venkman blanches and hurries off pretending not to know him
starts to follow him lenny
its pete venkman
the plainclothesmen cut venkman off and hardemeyer puts a heavy hand against venkmans chest
snide can i help you
dangerous yeah you can get your hand off my chest
hardemeyer smiles and drops his hand
im jack hardemeyer
im the mayors assistant
what can i do for you
im an old friend of the mayors
i just want to say hello to him
scornful i know who you are doctor venkman
busting any ghosts lately
no thats what i want to talk to the mayor about
we did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you
bristling look you stay away from the mayor
next fall barring a disaster hes going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two bit frauds
and publicity hounds like you and your friends
you read me
hardemeyer walks off with the two cops
okay i get it
but i want you to tell lenny that because of you im not voting for him
the broad front steps of the museum are crowded with tourists and visitors
dana arrives carrying a portfolio and artists tackle box and enters the museum
we are full frame on a larger than life full figure portrait of vigo the carpathian a demented and sadistic th century despot with an incredibly powerful evil presence
then we pull back to reveal the studio which is a large open space on the top floor of the museum lit by large skylights in the ceiling
working on the vigo painting is janosz poha a youngish art historian and painter the head of the department quirky intense and somewhat creepy
janosz is staring longingly across the room at dana
she is carefully cleaning a th century landscape painting still preoccupied by the extraordinary near accident with the buggy
janosz watches her for a moment then comes up behind her and looks over her shoulder
with an east european accent still working on the turner
dana jumps startled by the intrusion
oh yes i got in a little late this morning janosz
you know you are really doing very good work here
i think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations
thank you janosz
ive learned a lot here but now that my babys a little older i was hoping to rejoin the orchestra
at the mention of danas baby the figure of vigo miraculously turns his head and looks at dana
neither of them notice the movement in the painting
disappointed well be very sorry to lose you
perhaps i could take you to lunch today
actually im not eating lunch today
i have an appointment
looks at her watch in fact id better go
she starts gathering up her things
every day i ask you and every day youve got something else to do
do i have bad breath or something
trying to brush him off im sorry
perhaps some other time
okay ill take a raincheck on that
janosz smiles at her as she exits then goes back to his easel
to himself i think she likes me
he switches on an english language tape and starts practicing the phrases as he resumes working
dana barrett crosses the quad and enters a modern building
a sign identifies it as the institute for advanced theoretical research
dana is explaining the buggy incident to egon spengler the soberly intellectual techno wizard and former ghostbuster as he conducts an experiment assisted by a research team of graduate students
all of whom are japanese chinese or korean
the device he is testing is a black box about the size of a sony watchman with both digital and graphic displays
and then the buggy just suddenly stopped dead in the middle of the street did anyone else see this happen
hundreds of people
believe me i didnt imagine this
im not saying you did
in science we always look for the simplest explanation
an assistant interrupts
were ready dr
spengler to the assistant well start with the negative calibration
he picks up the device and prepares to test it
curious what are you working on egon
im trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field
its a theory ray and i were working on when we had to dissolve ghostbusters
an assistant draws a curtain revealing a large picture window actually a two way mirror that looks into a small waiting room
inside the waiting room they can see but not hear a youngish couple having a heated arguement
to dana they think theyre here for marriage counseling
weve kept them waiting for two hours and weve been gradually increasing the temperature in the room
checking a heat sensor its up to degrees at the moment
now my assistant is going to enter and ask them if theyd mind waiting another half hour
as spengler dana and the research team watch the assistant enters the waiting room and tells the couple about the new delay
they explode with anger both at him and each other while spengler monitors them through the glass
after recording his readings he returns to his assistant
well do the happiness index next
to dana id like to bring ray in on your case if its all right with you
okay whatever you think but not venkman
affectedly casual do you ever see him
occasionally how is he these days
i think he was borderline for a while there
then he crossed the border
does he ever mention me
not that i can recall
they move to another two way mirror through which they can see a lovely little girl playing with a wonderful array of toys
slightly disappointed well we didnt part on very good terms and we sort of lost track of each other when i got married
the assistant interrupts again
were ready for the affection test
to the assistant good
send in the puppy
continuing i thought of calling him after my marriage ended but
anyway i appreciate youre doing this egon they watch as another assistant enters the playroom with an adorable cocker spaniel puppy and gives it to the little girl
spengler monitors her as she jumps for joy and hugs the little dog
handing him a card this is my address and telephone number
will you call me
egon id rather you didnt mention any of this to peter if you dont mind
she shakes his hand and exits
to his assistant now lets see how she reacts when we take away the puppy its a small basement shop located on a quaint commercial block in greenwich village
the window is crowded with occult artifacts and old books full of arcane metaphysical lore
the telephone rings
answering the phone rays occult
the shelves are jammed floor to ceiling with books on the paranormal
ray sits on a barstool behind the counter wearing an old cardigan sweater over a t shirt
he has on a pair of reading glasses and chews on a battered reeking pipe
as he talks on the phone he prepares a cup of herb tea for spengler who is thumbing through an arcane text
on the phone yeah
what do you need
what have i got
ive got alchemy astrology apparitions bundu magic men demon intercession u
abductions psychic surgery stigmata modern miracles pixie sightings golden geese geists ghosts ive got it all what are you looking for
dont have any
try the stockyards
he hangs up
who was that
looking for goat hooves
come up with anything
referring to the book this ones interesting
berlin a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground
three hundred eyewitnesses
you might want to check those duke university mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis
going to the stacks good idea
the bones hanging over the door rattle as venkman enters the shop
oh hello perhaps you could help me
im looking for an aerosol love potion i could spray on a certain penthouse pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request
oh hiya pete
so no goat hooves huh
strung i knew that voice sounded familiar
hows it going
why dont you lock up and buy me a sub
slightly evasive uh i cant
im kind of working on something
spengler steps out of the stacks
howve you been
i bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours huh
i think theyre more interested in my epididymis
i dont even want to know where that is
venkman steps behind the counter and takes a beer from rays mini fridge
oh your book came in venkman
magical paths to fortune and power
he hands venkman the book
reading the contents so what are you guys working on
oh just checking something for an old friend
at a loss who
just someone we know
oh ray he grabs stantz by both ears and pulls up
i cant tell you
giving in dana
venkman lets go of his ears and smiles
spengler looks at stantz and shakes his head
the apartment is old and creatively furnished with a comfortable mix of modern and traditional pieces
maria a young hispanic woman who does day care for dana is feeding the baby in the kitchen when the doorbell dana enters from the bedroom and crosses to the
she opens it and admits ray and egon
hugging ray hi ray
its good to see you
thanks for coming
always glad to help and hug
to spengler hi egon
she shakes his hand and is about to close the door when venkman appears in the doorway
dana is caught completely off guard by venkmans surprise appearance
i knew youd come crawling back to me
she regards him coolly as always amused and amazed at his presumptuousness
to dana you know dana im very very hurt that you didnt call me first
im still into all this stuff you know
havent you ever seen my show
thats why i didnt call you first
i can see that youre still very bitter about us but in the interest of science im going to give it my best shot
lets go to work boys
stantz and spengler begin a comprehensive parapsychological work up on the baby and the immediate physical environment
venkman starts nosing around the apartment
dana follows him
so what happened to mr
i hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to europe
he didnt ditch me
we had some problems he got a good offer from an orchestra in england and he took it
he ditched you
you shouldve married me you know
you never asked me and every time i brought it up youd get drowsy and fall asleep
men are very sensitive you know
we need to feel loved and desired too
well when you started introducing me as the old ball and chain thats when i left
i may have a few personal problems but one thing i am is a total professional
he leaves her and crosses to spengler
hes taking a complete set of body and head measurements of the baby with a tape measure and calipers
what are you going to do egon
knit him a snowsuit
spengler ignores the remark and hands venkman a specimen jar
id like to have a stool specimen yeah you would
is that for personal or professional reasons
picking up the baby okay kid
up you go
he starts clowning with the baby holding him over his head and pressing his nose into the babys belly pretending that the baby is attacking him
please somebody help me
get him off
hes gone completely berserk
dana is amused and somewhat disarmed by venkmans rapport with the baby
what do you think
theres no doubt about it
hes got his fathers looks
the kid is ugly extremely ugly
resumes playing with the baby you stink
its just horrible
you are the stinkiest baby i ever smelled
to dana whats his name
his name is oscar
you poor kid
losing patience peter this is serious
i need to know if you think theres anything unusual about him
holds up the baby and scrutinizes him i dont know
i havent had a lot of experience with babies
he looks at the baby pulling his feet up trying to get the sleeper off
taking the specimen jar ill do it
venkman enters and finds stantz monitoring the room
to stantz well holmes what do you think
its an interesting one pete
if anything was going on its totally subdued now
to spengler what now brainiac
i think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street
finding something abnormal on the street shouldnt be too hard
dana walks down the street with venkman retracing the path of the runaway buggy
spengler and stantz follow monitoring pke valences from the pavement and the buildings
to dana nostalgic brings back a lot of sweet memories doesnt it
pointing out familiar neighborhood sights theres our old cash machine
and the dry cleaners we used to go to
and the old video store
he wipes away an imaginary tear we really had some good times didnt we
we definitely had a moment or two
dana stops at the intersection and points to the middle of the street
thats where the buggy stopped
okay lets take a look
venkman walks right out into the middle of the street completely oblivious to the cars honking and whizzing past him and starts motioning like a traffic cop bringing traffic to
then he signals for dana stantz and spengler to join him in the middle of the street
reading the pke meter is this the spot
a little to the left
thats where it stopped
stantz reads the pke meter
not a trace
why dont we try the giga meter
egon and i have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in gevs giga electron volts
thats a thousand million electron volts
i knew that
spengler switches on the giga meter the device he was testing in the lab and passes it over the spot on the street where the buggy stopped
the indicator goes right into the red zone and the device starts clicking i think we hit the honeypot boys
theres something brewing under the street
worried to venkman peter do you think maybe i have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things
you mean like the time you got possessed and turned into a monster terror dog
no not a chance
to stantz and spengler am i right
stantz and spengler look at him skeptically not convinced by the coincidence theory
the museum has just closed for the day and the last of the visitors and employees are leaving
janosz is working late on the painting of vigo
unnoticed by janosz the eyes of vigo start to glow
he touches his brush to the canvas and a powerful current of red crackling energy surges through the brush and courses through his body driving him to his knees
the figure of vigo comes to life turns toward janosz and gestures dramatically at him
then he speaks to janosz in a commanding voice
i vigo the scourge of carpathia the sorrow of moldavia command you
in agony command me lord
on a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain i sat on a throne of blood
what was will be what is will be no more
now is the season of evil
find me a child that i might live again
bolts of red hot energy shoot from the eyes of vigo into janoszs eyes
he screams and falls to his knees
venkman and stantz come out with small boxes containing coffee sandwiches and danish and start walking up the street
i love this
were onto something really big
i can smell it ray
were going to make some headlines with this one
hey hey hey stresshound
are you nuts
if anybody found out about this wed be in serious trouble
the judge couldnt have been clearer no ghostbusting
were going to keep this whole thing nice and quiet low key no profile
spengler wearing a hardhat is jackhammering a hole in the middle of the street
safety cones and reflectors have been set up and a small area is lit by strong work lights
it turns onto east th street cruises slowly up to the makeshift worksite and stops
the noise of the jackhammer is so loud spengler doesnt notice the police car and the two cops inside looking at them
finally he looks up sees the police car and freezes
how ya doing
reeking with guilt fine
its cutting fine now
curious why are you cutting
looking for one of the others why are we cutting
venkman and stantz arrive just in time wearing con ed hardhats doing a good imitation of a consolidated edison repairman
what are you doing here
belligerent what the hells it look like were doing
were bustin out asses over here cause some douchebag downtown aint got nothin better to do than make idiots like us work late on a friday night right
looks to spengler for agreement with a right on fist yo
the cops seem satisfied by the explanation
okay boys take it easy
they drive off
spengler breathes a great sigh of relief and starts rubbing his sore shoulders
you were supposed to help me with this
you need the exercise
stantz resumes jackhammering while venkman and spengler clear the rubble from the hole
suddenly he hits metal
they clear away generations of paving material revealing an ornate iron manhole cover
the manhole cover bears a strange logo and the letters nyprr
examing it nyprr
what the hell
help me lift this
they prey off the iron cover with crowbars uncovering a very dark and very deep abyss
shining a flashlight into the hole wow
its an old airshaft
it just goes forever
spengler leans in with the giga meter which is reading even higher now
we need a deeper reading
somebody has to go down there
venkman and spengler both look at ray
they snap stantz into a harness and lower him into the hole on a strong cable attached to a winch
ray calls out orders to them as he descends deeper and deeper
his voice echoing in the airshaft keep going more more stantz rappels off the sides of the airshaft as he continues his descent in total darkness
using a radio now lower lower to himself gee this really is deep
suddenly his feet kick thin air as he gets to the bottom of the airshaft and swings free in some kind of tunnel
shouts hold it
he pulls a powerful flashlight from his utility belt and shines it into the tunnel below
he is suspended near the top of a beautifully preserved chamber with rounded polished tile walls ardorned with intricate colorfully enameled art nouveau mosaics
a finely inlaid sign identifies it as van horne he pans the walls with his flashlight admiring the excellent tilework and speaks quietly to venkman and spengler over his walkie
reverently this is it boys the end of the line
van horne station
the old new york pneumatic
its still here
venkman has no idea what hes talking about
explaining the new york pneumatic railway
it was an experimental subway system
fan forced air trains built around
over the walkie talkie this is about as deep as you can go under manhattan without digging your own hole
to stantz whats the reading
stantz shines his flashlight on the meter and whistles at the extremely high reading
on the radio off the top of the scale
this place is really hot
lower me to the floor
as venkman and spengler feed him some more cable he pans his flashlight down the wall of the station then onto the floor
shouts hold it
below him is a river of bubbling seething glowing slime a veritable torrent of disgusting ooze
as he stares into the foul effluent we become aware of the strangely amplified and magnified sounds of great engines throbbing and pulsing in the bowels of the city of
water rushing through pipes steam hissing through ducts the muffled rumble of the subway and the roar of traffic and mixed with it all the unmistakable sounds of human conflict and pain voices shouting in anger screaming in fear groaning in pain a sad and eerie symphony
ranting on the radio oh my god
its a seething bubbling psychic cess
interlocked tubes of plasm crackling with negative gevs
its glowing and moving
its its a river of slime
he dangles from the end of the cable holding his feet up as high as he can
he unhooks a device from his utility belt and pulls the trigger on it shooting out a long telescoping fishing pole with a scoop on the end
reaching down he scoops up a sample of the slime and starts retracting the pole
suddenly a grotesque arm with a long skeletal fingers reaches up out of the slime and snatches at stantzs dangling feet
he jerks his legs up as several more arms poke up out of the slime and reach for him
on the radio haul me up venkman
venkman and spengler start hauling in the cable as a con ed supervisors car drives up and behind it the same police car they saw earlier
a burly supervisor gets out and crosses toward them followed by the two cops
no nonsense okay whats the story here
venkman and spengler stop pulling up the cable and venkman tries the belligerent worker ploy again only this time hes wearing a nynex hardhat
what i got time for this
we got three thousand phones out in the village and about eight million miles of cable to check
not buying it the phone lines are over there
points to the curb venkman pops spengler on the head
i told ya
stantz can be heard ranting over venkmans walkie talkie
pull me up
its eating my boots
venkman switches off the walkie talkie
you aint with con ed or the phone company
tell me another one
venkman stares at the cop for a long moment
stantz is hanging there looking down into the shaft at the slime which is now bubbling up the shaft after him
shouting get me out of here
desperate now he kicks wildly and knocks loose a section of an old rusting conduit
the conduit falls on a heavy electrical transmission line ripping through the cable with a shower of sparks
venkman spengler the cops and the supervisor all react to a bright flash deep down in the hole and a shout from stantz
one by one all the streetlights go out then the lights on all the buildings along east th street then the whole neighborhood blacks out and finally the entire city
is plunged into darkness
she walks around in the dark lighting candles and placing them all over the living room
then she finds a transistor radio and turns it on for information about the blackout
she listens to a special news report for a moment then has a compelling impulse to go check on the baby
she crosses to the nursery carrying a candle and quietly opens the door and looks in
suddenly the doorbell rings scaring her half to death
leaving the chain on the door she opens it a crack and sees janosz standing in the hall eerily lit by a red emergency spot at the end of the
he looks slightly dazed and even creepier
i happened to be in the neighborhood and i thought id stop by to see if everythings all right with you you know with the blackout and everything
are you okay
is the baby all right
his affected concern is chilling
she is frightened but conceals it from him
mechanically and cautiously were fine janosz
he tires to look around her into the apartment
do you need anything
you want me to come in
no everythings fine
okay just thought id check
good night dana
dont let the bedbugs bite you
good night janosz
she closes the door behind him and double locks it then stands there staring into the candlelight alone and afraid
janosz stands there in semi darkness then his eyes light up like headlights and he walks off down the hall
the judge a rather sour looking jurist of the old school calls the court to order
i want to make one thing very clear before we go any further
the law does not recognize the existence of ghosts and i dont believe in them either so i dont want to hear a lot of malarkey about goblins and spooks
were going to stick to the facts in this case and save the ghost stories for the kiddies
stantz leans over and whispers to spengler
seems like a pretty open minded guy huh
his nickname is the hammer
stantz and spengler are seated with their attorney louis tully lawyer cpa and former demonic possession victim
louis is desperately paging through a mountain of legal textbooks
nervous i think youre making a big mistake here fellas
i do mostly tax law and some probate stuff occasionally
i got my law degree at night school
thats all right
we got arrested at night
venkman is talking to dana at the wooden rail in front of the gallery
i wish i could stay
i feel personally responsible for you being here
you are personally responsible
if i can get conjugal rights will you visit me at sing sing
please dont say that
you wont go to prison
dont worry about me
im like a cat
you mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug
im el gato
i always land on my feet
sincerely good luck
she gives him a quick unexpected kiss and exits
venkman savors it for a moment then goes back to the defense table
jack hardemeyer the mayors principal aide is goading the prosecutor a very sober humorless woman in her late thirties
how are you doing hon
just put these guys away fast and make sure they go away for a long long time
it shouldnt be hard with this list of charges
the mayor and future governor wont forget this
he smiles conspiratorially and makes a point of passing the defense table on his way out of the courtroom
the ghostbusters look up as hardemeyer approaches
gloating nice going venkman
violating a judicial restraining order willful destruction of public property fraud malicious mischief smooth move
see you in a couple years at your first parole hearing
louis looks devastated
gee the whole citys against us
i think im going to be sick
spengler hands him a waste basket as the prosecutor calls her first witness
the con ed supervisor is testifying
fianella please look at exhibits a through f on the table over there
do you recognize that equipment
lying on the table are the basic tools of the ghostbusting trade three proton packs and particle throwers a couple of ghost traps and various meters and detection devices
thats the stuff the cops found in their truck
do you know what this equipment is used for
shrugs i dont know
catching ghosts i guess
to the judge may i remind the court that the defendants are under a judicial restraining order that specifically forbids them from performing services as paranormal investigators and eliminators
fianella can you identify the substance in the jar on the table marked exhibit f
she goes to the exhibit table and picks up a specimen jar containing the slime sample stantz removed from the tunnel
i been working underground for con ed for years and i never saw anything like that in my life
we checked out that tunnel the next day and we didnt find nothing
if it was down there they must have put it there
venkman and spengler look at stantz
defensively hey i didnt imagine it
there must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there
it may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source
nervously should i say that
i doubt that theyd believe us
louis moans and goes back to his notes
venkman himself is on the stand and louis is questioning him
so like you were just trying to help out your old friend because she was scared and you didnt really mean to do anything bad and you really love the
city and wont ever do anything like this again right
objection your honor
hes leading the witness
the witness is leading him
okay let me rephrase that question
to venkman didnt you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children
yes i did
we were city champs
irrelevant and immaterial
tully do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case
to venkman do i
no i think youve helped them enough already
to the judge no i guess not
to the prosecutor your witness
the prosecutor rises and approaches the witness stand with relish
venkman please explain to the court why it is you and your co defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street
seventy seventh and first avenue has so many holes already we didnt think anyone would notice
the gallery laughs and the judge gavels for order
keep that up mister and ill find you in contempt
sorry your honor but when somebody sets me up like that i cant resist
ill ask you again dr
why were you digging the hole
and please remember that youre under oath
i had my fingers crossed when they swore me in but im going to tell you the truth
there are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding things that cant be explained and that most people dont want to know about anyway
thats where we come in
so what are you saying
that the world of the supernatural is your special province
no i guess im just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it
the spectators in the gallery cheer and the judge gavels for order
the trial is nearing its end
the judge calls on louis to make his summation
does the counsel for the defense wish to make any final arguements
your honor may i approach the bench
louis crosses to the judges bench
to the judge can i have some of your water
get on with it counselor
scared your honor ladies and gentlemen of the he remembers theres no jury audience
i dont think its fair to call my clients frauds
okay the blackout was a big problem for everybody
i was stuck in an elevator for about three hours and i had to go to the bathroom the whole time but i dont blame them because once i turned
into a dog and they helped me
he goes back to the defense table and sits down
stantz and spengler hang their heads
venkman pats louis on the back
to louis way to go
concise and to the point
he stares at louis astonished at his summation
thats all you have to say
did i forget something
he searches through a disorderly pile of notes
that was unquestionably the worst presentation of a case ive ever heard in a court of law
i ought to cite you for contempt and have you disbarred
as for your clients peter venkman raymond stantz and egon spengler on the charges of conspiracy fraud and the willful destruction of public property i find you guilty on all
i order you to pay fines in the amount of each and i sentence you to eighteen months in the city correctional facility at rykers island
he sees the activity in the jar uh oh shes twitchin
the judge continues and on a more personal note let me go on record as saying that there is no place in decent society for fakes charlatans and tricksters like
you who prey on the gullibility of innocent people
youre beneath the contempt of this court
and believe me if my hands were not tied by the unalterable fetters of the law a law which has become in my view far too permissive and inadequate in
its standards of punishment i would invoke the tradition of our illustrious forebearers reach back to a sterner purer justice and have you burned at the stake
he hammers the bench with his gravel as the gallery erupts noisily
then he feels a low rumbling tremor in the courtroom
the slime starts to pulse and swell pushing up the lid on the jar
stantz anticipates big trouble
under the table boys
the ghostbusters duck under the defense table
he stands up and looks around fearfully
everybody is silent now as the rumbling increases
all eyes turn to the exhibit table
then suddenly all hell breaks loose as two full torso apparitions explode out of the specimen jar
he looks up in terror at the two huge apparitions looming above him and recognizes them immediately
in horror oh my god
the scoleri brothers
big in life even bigger in death the ghostly scoleri brothers seem ten feet tall
they are strapped into electric chairs and on their heads are metal electrocution caps with live sparking electrical wires still attached
twenty five hundred volts of electricity shoot through their bodies as they start to break free of the leather restraints trying to get at the judge
holding his gavel like a pitiful weapon he crawls over to the defense table where venkman stantz and spengler are now crouched assessing the spectral intruders
terrified youve got to do something
who are they
theyre the scoleri brothers
i tried them for murder
they were electrocuted up at ossining in
now they want to kill me
maybe they just want to appeal
they break loose from the electric chairs then turn toward the defense table and blast it with high voltage finger lightning
she sprints for the door pursued by one of the scoleri brothers
they jump to safety behind the rail of the jury box pulling the judge with them
these boys arent playing around
desperately youve got to stop them
thinking like a lawyer violating a judicial restraining order could expose my clients to serious criminal penalties
as their attorney id have to advise them against it
they start punching through the jury box
he is just about hysterical with fear
im recinding the order
he pounds his gavel on the floor now do something
lets go to work boys
with that the ghostbusters leap over the rail of the jury box and dash across the courtroom to the exhibit table where their proton packs were being displayed as evidence
they strap them on hastily as the brothers continue tearing up the seats looing for the judge
slinging the pack onto his back geez i forgot how heavy these things are
grabbing other gear okay lets heat em up
they flip the power switches on their packs and draw their particle throwers
all right throwers
set for full neutronas on stream
they switch on their throwers and turn to face the raging phantasms
they are just about to wipe out the judge when a loud shout distracts them
why dont you pick on someone your own size
the towering ghosts turn in a fury and raise their arms ready to shoot lightning at their new adversaries
to the others on my signal boys
open em up now
they all pull their triggers and the wands explode with incredible powerful streams of energy doing even more damage to the courtroom
spengs take the door
ray lets try and work them down and into the corner
working as a team they gradually confine the scoleri brothers with the streams forcing them closer and closer to the traps ray has set out on the floor
im coming under you pete
they circle around the two ghosts prodding them with the streams while ducking the lightning bolts shooting from their fingers
finally ray sees his chance and pops open the traps which emit inverted pyramids of light energy
steady watch your streams easy now venky bring him left spengy pull him down trapping trapping now
he stomps on a control pedal and the scoleri brothers are drawn into the traps which snap shut
leds on the outer casing start flashing indicating the presence of a ghost inside each trap
checking the trap occupado
he sticks his head up slowly from behind the debris of his bench and looks around in total amazement
he crawls out from under a chair
reporters and spectators get back on their feet and start buzzing about the incredible manifestation
shes lying on the floor attended to by the bailiff and the court clerk
to the prosecutor brilliant summation
they break into big smiles as photographers start snapping pictures of them standing in the wrecked courtroom
case closed boys
were back in business
the spectators cheer and applaud
the old dilapidated ghostbusters logo comes crashing to the ground dropped by a pair of workmen on a ladder and the new logo is hoisted into place over the main
its just like the original no ghosts logo but in the new one the ghost in the red circle is holding up two fingers
venkman enters the firehouse
a man and his wife are lying in bed reading
the man is played by louis tully and janine melnitz the ghostbusters once and future receptionist is playing his wife
they are both terrible actors
suddenly a ghost actually a very bad puppet on a wire floats through the bedroom
janine sees it and screams
what is it honey
its that darn ghost again
i dont know what to do anymore
he just wont leave us alone
i guess well just have to move
were not moving
he picks up the phone
who are you going to call
with a wink ghostbusters
as he starts to dial the camera pulls back to reveal the ghostbusters standing in the bedroom
their acting isnt much better than louis and janines
stantz speaks directly to the camera
im ray im peter im egon and were the
thats right ghostbusters
were back and were better than ever with twice the know how and twice the particle power to deal with all your supernatural elimination needs
during his speech winston can be seen in the b
pretending to trap the fake ghost
hes a mean one
and to celebrate our grand reopening were giving you twice the value with our special half price welcome back service plan
hold on ray
have you gone crazy
i guess so pete because thats not all
tell them what else weve got egon
spengler actually mouths everyone elses dialogue along with them waiting for his cue
you mean the ghostbusters hot beverage thermal mugs and free balloons for the kids
he holds up a mug and a limp uninflated balloon
as stantz wraps it up supers appear at the bottom of the screen fully so dont wait another minute
make your supernatural problem our supernatural problem
call now because were still in unison mechanically ready to believe you
hardemeyer is watching the ghostbusters commercial on a tv in his office
he bangs his fist on his desk and angrily switches off the tv
the garage door opens and the new improved ectomobile comes roaring out onto the street its ghostly siren moaning and wailing
louis comes running out after it
louis comes back into the garage bay and stops as he smells a foul odor
he sniffs around following the smell
oh geez smells like somebody took a really big he freezes
slimer a spud like green ghost is hovering over louiss desk scarfing down louiss bag lunch
slimer looks up and sees louis
they both scream and run off in opposite directions
he passes right through a wall and disappears
he runs right into a wall recovers and exits in a hurry
theres a thing
runners of both sexes and all ages are huffing and puffing as they jog along the track that circles the reservoir
one of the runners looks behind him at the sound of approaching footfalls and screams
a ghost jogger is loping along at a pretty fair pace
other runners stumble and run screaming into the park as he passes them
seemingly oblivious to the effect hes having the ghost jogger puts two fingers to his skeletal neck and checks his watch as if taking his pulse
venkman is sitting on a park bench near the jogging track reading the newspaper eating a donut and drinking coffee from a styrofoam cup
hes sitting on a bench opposite venkmans casually watching the jogging track
he approaches the benches where the ghostbusters are waiting
as the ghost jogger passes the benches stantz and venkman simultaneously hit concealed control buttons
a ghost trap buried in the track throws up a glowing inverted pyramid and catches the ghost jogger in mid stride
stantz and venkman close the trap and capture the ghost jogger
checking his watch you know he ran that last lap in under six minutes
if he wasnt dead hed be an olympic prospect
the ghostbusters come out carrying smoking traps wearing cheap dime store santa claus hats
to the client merry christmas
the ectomobile is parked at the curb and a curious crowd looks on as the ghostbusters enter the store
all the precious crystal is floating in the air several feet above the glass shelves and display tables
stantz and venkman are talking to the manager while winston and spengler set up an array of electronic devices positioned in each corner of the store
on a signal from stantz spengler and winston switch on the devices which throw laser type beams around the perimeter of the store
the manager watches in horror as all the glassware suddenly drops out of the air smashes through the glass shelves and shatters on the display tables
there is a long pregnant pause
to the manager so will that be cash or a check
everyone else has gone home
dana is cleaning her brushes and putting her supplies away
vigo turns his head and watches dana as she walks past the painting
she stops vaguely aware of the movement and looks up curiously at the painting
as she starts to walk on vigo looks at her again but dana turns suddenly and catches the movement
frightened now she hastily leaves the studio
louis is lurking behind a pillar peeking out at the office area
we pan down to the floor and see a foot pedal then pan along the cord to a ghost trap sitting on louiss desk
hanging from strings over the desk are several pieces of kentucky fried chicken
slimer partially emerges and furtively sniffs the air then spots the chicken bait
he licks his lips materializes completely and flies to the chicken
his eyes light up and he stomps the foot pedal
the trap pops open and shoots out a powerful cone of energy
slimer dodges it and escapes as a big section of the ceiling comes crashing down on louiss desk
seeing the damage uh oh
he slinks off defeated
the ghostbusters commercial is playing on a portable tv on the security desk
rudy the security guard is reading a national enquirer with a giant front page headline ghostbusters save judge
im looking for dana barrett
recognizing him hey
venkman world of the psychic
im a big big fan
that used to be one of my two favorite shows
whats the other one
its a fishing show
ever see it
yeah really great
take it easy
dana is working on a valuable flemish still life by ver meer
janosz is at the other end of the room still working on the painting of vigo
venkman enters and sneaks up behind dana
looking at the ver meer so this is what you do huh
glad to see him oh hello peter
youre really good you know
i didnt paint it
im just cleaning it
its an original ver meer
its worth about ten million dollars
he turns his head and watches venkman and dana
unaware that hes being watched venkman squints at the still life holding up his thumb like hes seen artists do
you know you can go to art world and get these huge sofa size paintings for about forty five bucks
he starts looking around at the other artwork in the studio
im sure you didnt come here just to talk about art
as a matter of fact i stopped by to tell you that i havent forgotten your problem and that were still on the case
they are interrupted by the sudden appearance of janosz
smiling at venkman dana arent you going to introduce me to your friend
oh im sorry
this is peter venkman
peter janosz poha
venkman warily shakes his hand trying to size him up
avoiding his gaze pleasure to meet you
ive seen you on television
how are you
looking over at the vigo painting whats that youre working on johnny
janosz winces at the nickname but lets it go
venkman and dana cross to the vigo painting
janosz steps protectively in front of it
its a painting im restoring for the new byzantine exhibition
its a self portrait of prince vigo the carpathian
he ruled most of carpathia and moldavia in the th century
staring at the painting too bad for the moldavians
defensive he was a very powerful magician
a genius in many ways and quite a skilled painter
he was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman
i hate this painting
ive felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage
yeah its not the kind of thing youd want to hang in the rec room
you know what it needs
picking up a brush a fluffy little white kitten in the corner
venkman reaches toward the painting but janosz grabs his hand
with forced good will we dont go around altering valuable paintings dr
well id make an exception in this case if i were you
dana looks disapprovingly at venkman
to janosz ill let you get back to it
nice meeting you
venkman and dana cross back to her workspace
confidentially i may be wrong but i think youve got a little crush on this guy
good bye peter
dragging his feet id like to stay but i really dont have time to hang around here
ill call you
calls out to janosz later johnny
vigo turns his head and follows dana as she returns to her workbench
she stops vaguely aware of the movement and looks up curiously at the painting
as she starts to walk on vigo looks at her again but dana turns suddenly and catches the movement
frightened now she hastily leaves the studio
venkman and winston enter and find stantz and spengler at work in the lab area
oh good youre here
spengler and i have something really amazing to show you
to spengler its not that thing you do with your nostrils is it
stantz goes to the refrigerator opens the freezer rummages around among the tv dinners and frozen pizza and pulls out a slime specimen in a tupperware container
to venkman weve been studying the stuff that we took from the subway tunnel
he pops the specimen jar in the microwave and lets it thaw for a minute
and now youre going to eat it
no im just restoring it to its normal state
he takes the specimen out of the microwave and pours some of it into a large petri dish
now watch this
he leans over the specimen and starts shouting at it
simulating anger you worthless piece of slime
as the slime starts to twitch and glow you ignorant disgusting blob
it bubbles and swells changing color with each insult
you foul obnoxious muck
he continues venting his rage on the slime
ive seen some real crud in my time but youre a chemical disgrace
the specimen doubles its size and starts spilling over the rim of the petri dish
they turn to venkman for his reaction
this is what you do with your spare time
very excited this is an incredible breakthrough venkman
a psychoreactive substance
whatever this is it clearly responds to human emotional states
we ought to bottle this stuff and sell it
weve found it at every event site weve been to lately
poking at the slime you mean this stuff actually feeds on bad vibes
like a goat on garbage
were running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction
what kind of tests
a little embarrassed well we sing to it we talk to it we say supportive nurturing things youre not sleeping with this stuff are you
spengler reacts as if he might be
it really responds to music
to spengler lets calm it down
spengler picks up a guitar and he and stantz start singing cumbaya to the slime specimen
it stops bubbling and starts to shrink
does it have any favorites
it likes all the sappy stuff cumbaya everything is beautiful its a small world but it loves jackie wilson
venkman and winston watch intently as spengler spoons some of the psych reactive slime onto an old toaster
stantz turns on a cassette player and jackie wilsons higher and higher blasts from the speakers
it shakes spins and actually starts moving in time with the music
he stares in disbelief at the dancing toaster as it shoots two pieces of toast into the air and catches them without missing a beat
i dont care what you say
this could be a major christmas gift item
right and the first time someone gets mad their toaster will eat their hand
so well put a warning on the label
stantz turns off the music and the toaster stops moving
venkman looks at the toaster and sticks his fingers in the slot
to the toaster go ahead
i dare you
suddenly he yelps as if the toaster has actually bitten into his hand and wont let go
the others jump in to help him but venkman laughs and easily withdraws his hand
dana brings oscar into the bathroom and lays him on the bassinet
shes wearing a robe over her nightgown preparing to bathe the baby
she turns the taps on the old claw footed bathtub checks the water temperature then turns away and starts to undress the baby
talking sweetly to the baby look at you
i think we got more food on your shirt than we got in your mouth
the water pouring from the faucet changes to slime and settles at the bottom of the tub
dana reaches over and turns off the water without looking into the tub
when she turns away both taps start to spin by themselves and the tub flexes and bulges
still unaware she routinely reaches over and squirts some bubble bath into the tub
the rim of the tub puckers up and the sides convulse as if swallowing the bubble bath
she picks the baby up off the bassinet and turns to place him in the tub
she is just about to lower him into the water when the tub starts to close up around the baby like a hugh mouth
dana screams snatches the baby away and runs from the room clutching oscar to her bosom as the bathtub convulses and vomits up buckets of slime
the big open loft space is a chaotic clutter of mismatched furniture old magazines books tapes and sports equipment
venkman is asleep on the floor still wearing his coat scarf hat and gloves having collapsed just short of the bedroom
the doorbell rings he wakes up lumbers to his feet and answers it
he opens the door and sees dana standing there
she is wearing only a nightgown under her coat and oscar is naked wrapped in a baby blanket
somewhat embarrassed to be there im sorry
were you on your way out
surprised to see her no i just got in a couple hours ago
come on in
noting her apparel are we having a pajama party
upset peter the bathtub tried to eat oscar
venkman looks at her for a long moment
you know if anyone else told me that id have serious doubts
but coming from you i cant honestly say im surprised
i must be losing my mind
at the museum today i could have sworn that terrible painting of vigo looked right at me
who could blame him
were you wearing this nightgown
distraught i dont know what to do anymore
ill get ray and egon to check out the bathtub
you better stay here
he exits to the bathroom
she looks around the loft amazed at the disorder
venkman comes back immediately with an old sweatshirt and takes oscar from her
now this kid has a serious nudity problem
he spreads the sweatshirt out on the sofa lays the baby on it and starts tying it around him like a diaper
to the baby this is joe namaths old number you know
you could get a lot of chicks with this
just dont pee in it
peter what about the bathtub
grabs the phone and dials well take care of that
on the phone ray pete
listen get over to danas right away
her bathtub pulled a fast one tried to eat the kid
it was full of this awful pink ooze
to ray sounds like another slime job
no theyre all right
theyre here now
let me know
he hangs up
theyre going over there right now
you might as well make yourself at home
let me show you around
he crosses to the kitchen area this is the cuisine de maison its an incredible mess
the sink is piled high with dirty dishes and the counters are littered with all sorts of food trash
he grabs a big open hefty bag on the floor and starts throwing garbage into it
looking at the sink we may have to wash some of these if you get hungry he looks in the fridge but theres no food anyway so forget about it
i have all kinds of carry out menus if you feel like ordering
he opens a drawer full of pizza barbecue and chinese food menus then crosses to the bathroom
bathrooms right here let me just tidy up a few things
peter this is very nice but you dont have to do any of this you know
he goes into the bathroom and we hear water running the toilet flushing and more items going into the hefty bag
the shower works but its a little tricky
theyre both marked hot
it takes a little practice but at least this one wont try and eat you
he comes out of the bathroom with the now loaded hefty bag over his shoulder
be careful on that sofa its a butt biter
but the beds good and i just changed the sheets so if you get tired feel free
in fact i think you should definitely plan on spending the night here
and how would we handle the sleeping arrangements
for me its best if i sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me
if we go the other way im afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night
how about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby
or we could do that
she picks up oscar poor baby
i think i should put him down now
ill put him down for you
taking the baby you are way too short
and your belly button sticks out
youre nothing but a burden to your poor mother
venkman carries the baby into the bedroom leaving dana in the living room feeling more relaxed and a lot safer
venkman is waiting in front of the building as ecto pulls up and stantz spengler and winston get out and report on danas apartment
did you find anything at danas
just some mood slime residue in and around the bathtub
but we did turn up some interesting stuff on this vigo character you mentioned
i found the name vigo the carpathian in leon zundingers magicians martyrs and madmen
listen to this reads from xerox of entry vigo the carpathian born died a hundred and five years
he really hung on didnt he
and he didnt die of old age either
he was poisoned stabbed shot hung stretched disemboweled drawn and quartered
i guess he wasnt too popular at the end there
no not exactly a man of the people
reads also known as vigo the cruel vigo the torturer vigo the despised and vigo the unholy
this guy was a bad monkey
he dabbled in all the black arts and listen to this prophecy
just before his head died his last words were death is but a door time is but a window
ill be back
ill be back
its a rough translation from the moldavian
they enter the museum carrying their monitoring equipment
rudy the guard looks up in surprise as the ghostbusters enter
whats going on
were just going up to restorations for a minute
oh i cant let you do that
poha told me not to let you up there anymore
with mock seriousness okay we were trying to keep this quiet but i think you can be trusted
tell him ray
very official mister you have an ecto paritic subfusionary flux in this building
we got a flux
you got a flux and a half
now if you dont want to be the he counts fifth person ever to die in meta shock from a planar rift i suggest you get down behind that desk
and dont move until we give you the signal stabilize all clear
rudy gulps and starts to hunker down behind the desk as the ghostbusters head upstairs
janosz is working on the vigo painting when the ghostbusters enter
he rushes over and stops them at the door
dana is not here
then why have you come
we got a major creep alert and were just going down the list
your name was first
to spengler and winston lets sweep it boys
they deploy and start scanning the studio with their monitoring devices
to janosz you know i never got to ask you
where you from johnny
nervous the upper west side
consulting his pke meter this entire room is extremely hot peter
what exactly are you looking for dr
well know when we find it
you just sit tight
this wont take long
using the giga meter he traces a strong psychomagnetheric reading to the painting of vigo in the alcove at the end of the studio
venkman comes up behind him with janosz right on his heels
this is the one that looked at dana
it must be the chemical fumes in the studio
people start imagining things interrupts im going to rule out the glue sniffing theory
if she says it looked at her it looked at her
to vigo hey you
look at me
im talking to you
look at me when im talking to you
they watch the painting for any sign of movement
his eyes stare lifelessly into the distance
venkman starts shooting polaroids of vigo
to vigo beautiful beautiful
work with me baby
just have fun with it
to stantz okay hes playing it cool
lets finish up and get out of here
ill get one more reading
venkman walks off leaving stantz alone with the painting
stantz scans the painting with the giga meter until his eyes meet vigos
his eyes seems to burn right through to the depths of stantzs soul
he stands there transfixed unable to look away as a strange and subtle transformation occurs within him
winston comes up behind him and breaks the spell
looking at the painting now thats one ugly dude
coming back to his senses huh
you finished here
are you all right
you coming down with something
no im fine
i just got light headed for a second there
they head for the door
he escorts the ghostbusters to the door
so you see everything is in order is it not
dont leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities
well be back
the ghostbusters cross to ecto
theres definitely something going on in that studio
the pke levels were max plus and the giga meter was showing all red
id put my money on that vigo character
yeah thats a safe bet
to stantz you and spengman see what else you can dig up on vigo and this little weasel poha
those two were made for each other
the ghostbusters are driving back to the firehouse
stantz is at the wheel
his eyes are vacant he seems distracted and very tense
stantz swerves suddenly and honks the horn angrily
to another driver idiot
honking move it you jerk
venkman and winston exchange surprised looks
stantz drives extremely fast honking vindictively weaving dangerously through traffic
winston looks at ray concerned
going a little fast arent we ray
stantz turns on him
viciously are you telling me how to drive
no i just thought well dont think
he honks again and tromps hard on the accelerator
ecto is now barreling down the avenue
pedestrians leap to safety as stantz runs a red light
they hang on to the safety straps as stantz continues his maniacal ride
to stantz really worried now are you crazy man
youre going to kill somebody
stantz looks at him and smile demonically
no im going to kill everybody
he swerves off the road
the car heads right for a big tree
at the last possible moment winston cold cocks stantz grabs the wheel and steps across to stomp on the brakes
the car skids into the tree and stops
the ghostbusters stumble out dazed and shaken but unhurt
stantz rubs his eyes and looks at the others completely at a loss
himself again what happened
you just picked up three penalty points on your drivers license
are you all right
yeah i guess so
it was the strangest thing
i knew what i was doing but i couldnt stop
this really terrible feeling came over me and i dont know i just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all
they inspect the damage to the car
confidentially to spengler watch him egon
dont even let him shave
theres a knock at the front door a key turns in the lock and venkman enters somewhat tentatively holding a bouquet of flowers and a small suitcase of danas
calls out im home
he looks around the large open loft
to himself i knew it
he hears the shower running and crosses to the bathroom
the door is half open and he can see dana in the shower tastefully blurred through the transparent vinyl curtain
he closes the bathroom door and looks at the baby asleep on the bed surrounded by pillows to prevent him rolling off
then he turns and bumps into dana whos just coming out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel
she jumps back into the bathroom
she comes out again this time wearing a robe
are you all squeaky clean now
humoring him yes im very clean
did they find anything at my apartment
she squeezes past him into the bedroom and closes the door
through the door nothing
they stayed there all night went through your personal stuff made a bunch of long distance phone calls and cleaned out your refrigerator
and didnt find anything
dana opens the bedroom door
they didnt find anything
in the bathtub the pink ooze
so what do i do now
now you get dressed and we go out
i got a babysitter and everything
trust me you need it
im not here to date
i cant leave oscar in a strange place with someone i dont know
its janine melnitz from my staff
shes one of my most valuable employees
does she know anything about babies
janine melnitz are you kidding
handing her the flowers do i have a vase
i brought some of your clothes
wear something intriguing
i brought along some interesting possibilities
okay but its not a date
its a dinner
she smiles and closes the door again
he opens the closet and starts looking for his good suit
did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here
i put them in your hamper
i thought they were dirty
shaking his head i have a hamper
next time ask me first okay
i have more than two grades of laundry
therere lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty
he pulls some clothes out of the hamper and inspects them
these arent so bad yet
you just hang them up for a while and theyre fine
janine covers her computer terminal and starts turning out the lights
then she notices that the lights are still on upstairs
she starts primping and freshening up her makeup
louis is strapping on a proton pack preparing to deal with slimer once and for all
hes wearing a bicyclists rearview mirror on a headband
to himself okay stinky this is it
you and me pal
you think youre smarter than i am
well see about that
loud oh hello pizza man
oh two larges
i only ordered one
oh pepperoni and pineapple
my absolute favorite
i guess ill have to eat these both by myself
slimer pokes his head through the ceiling and scans the room hanging upside down
he spots slimer through the rearview mirror
quietly okay lets boogie
he whirls around and fires a proton stream at slimer slicing a burning a gash across the ceiling
janine comes up and ducks as a bolt of energy streaks across the room and strikes the wall behind her
embarrassed and apologetic oh migod
i didnt mean to do that
it was an accident
what are you doing up here
i was trying to get that smelly green thing
the guys asked me to help out
im like the fifth ghostbuster
why would you want to be a ghostbuster if youre already an accountant
oh no its just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt
louis quickly slips off the proton pack and sets it down
have you made any plans yet
you know tomorrow is new years eve
no i celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is march first
that way i beat the crowds
thats very practical
i hate going out on new years eve too
there is an awkward silence between them and janine starts to leave
well good night louis
on an impulse janine do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home
id like to but i told dr
venkman id babysit
seductively do you want to babysit with me
oh sure that sounds great
there is a knock at the door and venkman goes to answer it
hes dressed for the evening and looking very dapper
venkman opens the door and finds stantz spengler and winston standing there wearing over the hip rubberized waders firemens slickers and miners helmets carrying tons of sensing devices meters collection
jars and photographic equipment
they look like theyre rigged out for a major spelunking expedition
ushering them in dont tell me let me guess
all you can eat barbecue rib night at the sizzler
were going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho reactive slime flow
we thought you might want to come along
i wish id known you were going
im stuck with these damn dinner reservations
you know animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters
given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population
sounds better and better
calls out dana
the boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime
egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach breeding surge
should we forget about dinner and go with them instead
dana steps into the living room looking very beautiful
dana looks curiously at their outfits
they nod and wave back
to ray and egon i think were going to have to pass on the sewer trip boys
let me know what you find out
on his exit okay but youre missing all the fun
stantz spengler and winston come down the stairs into the station guided by a very old map of the underground city
this is it
van horne station
right where the old transit map said it would be
they cross to the edge of the platform and look into the river of slime
lets get a sounding on the depth of that flow
stantz has a long coiled graduated cord with a plumb bob on the end of it attached to his utility belt
he takes the cord in his hand swings the plumb bob over his head and casts it out into the middle of the flow
the plumb bob sinks and spengler reads the depth
six feet seven eight thats it
its on the bottom
nine feet ten is the line sinking
no the slime is rising
stantz looks down and notices the slime rising over the edge of the platform and around his boots
alarmed lets get out of here boys
he starts to pull out the plumb line but it seems to be stuck
spengler tries to help but whatever is pulling on the cord is stronger than all three of them
as their unseen adversary pulls them closer and closer to the edge stantz works desperately to unhook the cord from his belt but finally just unhooks the whole belt
spengler lets go in time but winston doesnt
he is jerked off his feet and into the slime flow
stantz and spengler look at each other summon their courage and jump in after him
dana and venkman are sitting at a table in an elegant restaurant nibbling caviar and toasting with very expensive champagne
very intimate heres to us
she sighs and drinks
so are you making any new years resolutions
i want to stop getting involved with men who arent good for me
does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow or could you hold off for a few days maybe
for one night in your life do you think its possible for us to be completely real
all right you want to be real
so tell me why did you dump me
oh peter i didnt dump you
i just had to protect myself
you really werent very good for me you know
im not even good for me
why do you say things like that
youre so much better than you know
if i had that kind of support on a daily basis i could definitely shape up by the turn of the century
already feeling the effects of the champagne so why dont you give me a jingle in the year
let me jingle you right now
he leans over to kiss her
maybe i should call janine
janine has a very special way with children
janine is on the sofa doing her nails while louis paces with the baby
looking around i cant believe a person could actually live like this
to the baby so these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them
its really not a bad place
it just needs a womans touch
continuing so they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services which was a good deal for all of them because then they didnt have to withhold tax and
social security which im not saying is right but its just a story so i guess its all right
i can finish this later if youre tired
louis goes into the bedroom and puts the baby down
youre really good with children louis
i can tell
as he returns why dont you come here and sit with me
he sits stiffly beside her on the sofa
getting close motherhood is a very natural instinct for me
id like to have a baby myself
a manhole cover is dislodged and pushed up from below
it slides away and winston crawls out of the manhole followed by stantz and spengler
they are exhausted and covered with slime
uncharacteristically angry nice going ray
what were you trying to do drown me
unusually mean look zeddemore it wasnt my fault you were too stupid to drop that line
shoves him you better watch your mouth man or ill punch your lights out
just go ahead and try it
spengler steps between them with unprecedented aggression
if you two are looking for a fight you got one
putting up his fists who wants it first
come on ray
try me sucker
squaring off butt out you pencil necked geek
ive had it with you
they grab each other and start to tussle
suddenly spengler comes to his senses and pulls them apart
get out of those clothes
he starts yanking off his slicker and waders
bewildered stantz and winston start doing the same
spengler helps pull off their clothes and throws them into the open manhole
now wearing only long underwear they seem to return to normal
what are we doing
ray i was ready to kill you
dont you see
its the slime
that stuff is like pure concentrated evil
stantz looks around and sees that they are standing right in front of the museum
and its all flowing right to this spot
the maitre d looks up in surprise as stantz spengler and winston enter the restaurant wearing only long underwear
intercepting them can i help you
stantz looks around and spots venkman
thats all right i see him
they blow right by the maitre d who jumps back in horror as they pass
hes just about to pour more champagne when he sees ray egon and winston coming toward him through the restaurant
very excited you shouldve been there venkman
yeah sorry i missed it
noting their attire i guess you guys didnt know about the dress code here
its really kind of a coat and tie place
its all over the city pete well under it actually
rivers of the stuff
and its all flowing toward the museum
he gestures excitedly and a big gob of slime flies across the room and lands on a well dressed diner
calls out sorry
maybe we should discuss this somewhere else
venkman notes the look of alarm on danas face and pulls his colleagues aside
confidentially boys listen
youre scaring the straights
lets save this until tomorrow okay
to venkman this wont wait until tomorrow venkman
its hot and its ready to pop
he hurries through the restaurant with two city cops right behind him and makes straight for venkmans table
arrest these men
recognizing them hey
its the ghostbusters
youre out of uniform gentlemen stantz suddenly realizes how ridiculous they look
self conscious uh well we had a little accident but forget that
we have to see the mayor as soon as possible
look doc why dont you just go home
youll get a good nights sleep and then you can give the mayor a call in the morning
he takes stantz by the arm but stantz resists
were not going anywhere with you
i told you we have to see the mayor now
grabbing stantz im warning you
you can come along peaceably or grabs the cop hey dont be an idiot
this is serious
angry look pal keep this up and youre going with them
has had enough yeah lets go
youre all under arrest
the cop catches venkman in an armlock and starts walking him out of the restaurant
to dana finish your dessert its already paid for
ill call you
they all exit causing a major commotion among the other diners
the police car is parked right behind ecto
spengler stops at the police car and confronts the cops
look were not drunk and were not crazy
this is a matter of vital importance
venkman steps in and looks at the policemens nametags
what are you doing
i just want to get your names right for when the mayor asks us why we didnt let him know about this sooner
the cops look at each other uncertain about what to do
relenting okay doc
you want to see the mayor you got it
they head for their respective vehicles
louis and janine are on the sofa making out when dana enters
they jump up and start smoothing their clothes
embarrassed oh hello dana
we were just we were i know what you were doing louis
its all right
how was your date
peter was arrested
has he called
no nobody called
is everything all right with oscar
oh hes fine
hes such a good baby
he was a little fussy at first but we gave him a freach bread pizza and he went right to sleep
relieved oh good
ill just check on him
she crosses to the bedroom
dana looks at oscar sleeping peacefully on the bed
she starts to change clothes
louis and janine arent sure what to do
should we go
i dont think we should leave her alone
we should stay
he grabs janine and they start making out again
janosz stands before the painting of vigo
vigo comes to life and repeats the litany of his power
i vigo the scourge of carpathia heard all this before yes the scourge the sorrow of moldavia the sorrow i command you
checking his watch i await the word of vigo
the season of evil begins with the birth of the new year
bring me the child that i might live again
abjectly humble lord vigo the mother dana is fine and strong
i was wondering well would it be possible if i bring the baby could i have the woman
so be it
on this the day of darkness she will be ours wife to you and mother to me
preceded by a police car ecto enters the small park on the east river at th street and disappears into an underground entrance
the camera pans up to reveal gracie mansion the residence of the mayor of new york city
the ghostbusters now wearing police raincoats over their longjohns are ushered through the house by a butler to a set of double oak doors
the butler knocks lightly then opens the door to reveal the mayor sitting in front of the fireplace in his well appointed private study flanked by jack hardemeyer both in
the ghostbusters enter
the mayor is impatient and a little angry at having been pulled out of his formal reception
he frowns at their bizarre attire
all right the ghostbusters
ill tell you right now ive got two hundred of the heaviest campaign contributors in the city out there eating bad roast chicken waiting for me to give the speech
of my life
youve got two minutes
make it good
you get enough negative energy flowing in a dense environment like manhattan it starts to build up and if we dont do something fast this whole place will blow like
a frog on a hotplate
tell him about the toaster
i dont think hes ready for the toaster
shaking his head being miserable and treating other people like dirt is every new yorkers god given right
what am i supposed to do go on television and tell eight million people they have to be nice to each other
im sorry none of this makes any sense to me and if anything does happen weve got plenty of paid professionals to deal with it
your two minutes are up
good night gentlemen
the mayor exits leaving the ghostbusters to hardemeyer
smirking thats quite a story
yeah i think the times might be interested dont you
the post might have a lot of fun with it too
hardemeyers eyes go cold and calculating
before you go running to the newspapers with this would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown
now youre talking
an attendant opens a locked door with a wire mesh window and the ghostbusters in straitjackets are led into the psych ward as hardemeyer confers with the chief psychiatrist
protesting im telling you were not crazy
he laughs off the remark
to the psychiatrist the mayor wants them kept under strict observation for a few days
we think theyre seriously disturbed and potentially dangerous
well do whatevers necessary
hardemeyer shakes his hand and exits as the door slams shut on the ghostbusters
louis and janine are watching an old rerun on tv eating popcorn while dana is stretched out on the other sofa
wishing theyd leave you know you really dont have to stay
peter should be back soon
oh no we dont mind
she hears a little cry from the nursery and sits up
i think oscar is up
she crosses to the bedroom
dana enters and immediately notices that the crib is empty and the window is open
frantic now dana rushes to the window and looks out as louis and janine come running in
the baby is standing out on the ledge at the corner of the building fifty feet above the street staring off into the distance as if hes waiting for something
dana climbs out onto the ledge and starts inching slowly toward the baby
then she stops as a miraculous apparition materializes
they lean out the window gaping at the apparition
a sweet kindly looking english nanny appears pushing a pram strolling on thin air parallel to the ledge high above the ground
her face looks remarkably like janosz pohas
the nanny extends her hand to the baby who gurgles sweetly as he reaches out to take it
she watches in helpless horror
she picks up the baby and lays it gently in the pram then turns and smiles at dana
the smile turns to a hideous grin then the nanny shrieks at dana and takes off like a shot with the baby
she watches the creature fly off with oscar then climbs back through the window assisted by louis and janine
resolutely louis you have to find peter and tell him what happened
confused and worried wherere you going
to get my baby back
a taxi pulls up dana jumps out and rushes into the museum
the moment the door closes behind her there is a loud thunderclap the ground trembles and a massive amount of slime erupts from around the base of the museum and
starts covering the walls sealing her inside the building
venkman stantz spengler and winston are in a padded cell
they are handcuffed and the cuffs are chained to thick leather belts around their waists
venkman stands there banging his head into the padded wall while the others try to explain the situation to a skeptical psychiatrist
we think the spirit of vigo the carpathian is alive in a painting at the manhattan museum
and are there any other paintings in the museum with bad spirits in them
impatient youre wasting valuable time
we have reason to believe that vigo is drawing strength from a psychomagnetheric slime flow thats been collecting under the city
yes tell me about the slime
its potent stuff
we made a toaster dance with it then a bathtub tried to eat his friends baby
the psychiatrist looks at venkman
dont look at me
i think theyre nuts
moonlight streams through the skylight above bathing the studio in eerie white light
oscar is lying safely on a table in front of the painting of vigo
dana enters cautiously and sees the baby
seeing no one else about she quickly sneaks down to the table and picks up the baby hugging hin tight greatly relieved to find him unharmed and intact
i knew you would come
startled dana turns at the sound of his voice as janosz steps out from behind the vigo painting
defiantly what do you want with my baby
no harm will come to the child
you might even say its a privilege
he will be the vessel for the spirit of vigo
and you well you will be the mother of the ruler of the world
doesnt that sound nice
if this is what the world will be like i dont want to live in it
confidentially indicating vigo i dont believe we have the luxury of choice
everybody has a choice
not in this case my dear
take a look
thats not gainsboroughs blue boy up there
i dont care who he is
hes not taking my baby
dana walks quickly to the door but suddenly oscar flies out of her arms floats across the room and lands lightly back in the cradle
she turns and looks at vigo for the first time feeling his power
you will see
its all for the best
its the last day of the year and the sun is shining brightly
the ghostbusters are sitting in the dayroom a dingy lounge for patients in the locked ward
there is a television set a ping pong table and a few tables and chairs
stantz is looking at the sky through the heavy wire mesh covering the windows
this is it
venkman is doing occupational therapy weaving on a little hand loom
it better not start yet
im trying to finish my potholder before lunch
you think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the s are true
a patient at the next table joins the discussion
my dog told me
what kind of dog
shakes his head habitual liars
they cant help it
its in the breed
louis is pleading with his cousin sherman tully a doctor on the staff at parkview
he looks and sounds just like louis
come on sherm
youre my cousin
do this for me
im begging you
i cant do it louis
it isnt ethical
i could lose my license
why cant you just have them released
youre a doctor
im a dermatologist
i cant write orders on the psych ward
sherman ive done lots of favors for you
i got you out of those bad tax shelters
you were the one who got me in
i fixed you up with diane troxler and she put out didnt she
yeah i had to give her free dermabrasion for a year
forget it louis
i could get in a lot of trouble
im telling you were all going to be in big trouble if we dont do something fast
that ghost guy came and took my friends baby and we got to get it back
its just a scared little baby sherm
then you should go to the police
i dont believe in any of that stuff
sherman looks out the window
the sky begins to go dark as the sun is magically eclipsed
the room goes dark
louis switches on a lamp which casts an eerie light on his face
spooky do you believe it now sherm
a drainpipe starts dripping slime into the river near the cunard line docks
with the plaza hotel in the background the fountain starts to spout psycho reactive slime
a well heeled man and woman step out of a limousine and walk up the steps toward the revolving door
she looks up at the sky and frowns
shrewish i told you we should have stayed in palm beach
the weather here gets stranger every year
she doesnt notice it but a small amount of slime falls on the back of her luxurious full length white mink coat
the doorman nods courteously and extends a hand to help her up the stairs
she yelps in pain
to the doorman something just bit me
the doorman looks curiously at her then recoils in shock as her coat comes alive
mink heads pop out of the thick fur snarling barking and yapping their sharp little teeth biting the air
reacting quickly the doorman yanks the coat off the womans back throws it to the ground and starts stomping on it as the woman and her husband look on in
the coat scuttles down the steps and runs off down the street
the squad room is busy as detectives try to answer the flood of calls regarding the wave of supernatural events sweeping the city
on the phone look lady of course there are dead people there
its a cemetery
his face falls they were asking you for directions
on another phone was this a big dinosaur or a little dinosaur
oh just the skeleton huh
well where is it now
on the phone wait a second the park bench was chasing you
you mean someone was chasing you in the park
no the bench itself was chasing you
i see a weary sergeant answers a ringing phone
manhattan central flaherty speaking
who is this
wait a second
he puts the caller on hold and turns the lieutenant
lieutenant i think you better talk to this guy
on another call what is it
im talkin here
its some dock supervisor down at pier on the hudson
the guys going nuts
whats the problem
takes a deep breath he says the titanic just arrived
the dock supervisor stands there with the phone in his hand an assistant beside him both staring out the window at the ocean liner tied up at the pier
the name r
titanic is clearly visible on the side of the huge ship
the gangplank is down and dozens of drowned passengers sopping wet and festooned with seaweed are disembarking while drowned porters off load their waterlogged baggage
ecto is parked outside as louis and sherman come out of the hospital with the ghostbusters now wearing their standard uniforms
good work louis
how did you get us out
oh i pulled a few strings
i wouldnt want to say any more than that
louis winks conspiratorially at sherman
this is my cousin sherman
sherm say hello to the ghostbusters
sotto voce to stantz i promised him a ride in the car if he got you out
to the ghostbusters hi its really great to meet you guys
i know this sounds weird but once i had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed but i knew it was impossible because he
died and he started to tell me that while hes talking the ghostbusters jump in the ectomobile and drive off leaving him and louis standing at the curb
okay ill meet you there
i thought you were like the fifth ghostbuster
i let them handle all the little stuff
i just come in on the big ones
original version of the above scene transcribers notes these two versions of this scene were put in my copy of the script so i have included both of them here
actually they still think youre crazy but i convinced them youre not dangerous
determined yeah well guess again
ecto is parked outside and the ghostbusters are hastily donning their standard uniforms
i brought everything you asked for and i gassed up the car with super unleaded
it cost twenty cents more than regular unleaded but you get much better performance and in an old car like this thatll end up saving you money in the long
i put it on my credit card so you can either reimburse me or i can take it out of petty cash while hes talking the ghostbusters jump in the
ecto and drive off without him
okay ill meet you there
ecto pulls to the curb across the street from the museum
hundreds of spectators are already there gawking at the building as the ghostbusters jump out and gape at the sight that greets them
the building is now totally covered in a shell of psycho reactive slime
city workmen and firemen are trying to cut their way in with blowtorches jackhammers power tools and the jaws of life but they cant even make a dent
they size up the situation as they don their proton packs
it looks like a giant jello mold
i hate jello
they stride manfully across the street and approach the main entrance to the museum
to the fire captain okay give it a rest captain
well take it from here
skeptical be my guest
we been cutting here for three hours
what the hells going on
you know the titanic arrived this morning
well better late than never
the workmen and firemen put down their tools and fall back as the ghostbusters draw their particle throwers
monitoring valences full neutronas maser assist
they adjust their settings and prepare to fire
they trigger their throwers and spray the front doors of the building with bolts of proton energy but it has no effect on the hardened slime
to the firemen okay who knows cumbaya
a few of the firemen and workmen tentatively raise their hands
venkman grabs them and lines them up at the entrance of the museum
nice and sweet starts singing cumbaya milord cumbaya stantz spengler winston and the firemen sing along reluctantly holding hands and swaying to the music
singing cumbaya milord cumbaya cumbaya milord cumbaya oh lord cumbaya
stantz inspects the wall of slime with his infra goggles and finds that they have only managed to open a hole the size of a dime
the vienna boys choir couldnt get through this stuff
should we say supportive nurturing things to it ray
it wont work
theres no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell
i cant believe things have gotten so bad in this city that theres no way back
sure its crowded its dirty its noisy
and there are too many people whod just as soon step on your face as look at you
but thereve got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned out burg
we just have to mobilize it
we need something that everyone can get behind a symbol his eyes fall on ecto s new york state license plate which features a line drawing of the statue of
he sees it too something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us something good and pure and decent
there is a commotion among the crowd as the mayors limousine arrives with a police escort
jack hardemeyer steps out followed by the mayor himself and they cross to the museum entrance
hardemeyer his assistant and several police bodyguards confront the ghostbusters
look ive had it with you
get your stuff together get back in that clown car and get out of here
this is a city matter and everythings under control
oh you think so
well ive got news for you
youve got draculas brother in law in there and hes got my girlfriend and her kid
around about midnight tonight when youre partying uptown this guys going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants
and thats just round one
are you telling me therere people trapped in there
to his assistant this is dynamite
and get them down here right away
when the police bring this kid out i want them to hand it right to the mayor and i want it all on camera
mayor if we dont do something by midnight youre going to go down in history as the man who let new york get sucked down into the tenth level of
the mayor stops to consider the situation
to the fire captain can you get into that museum
if i had a nuclear warhead maybe
the mayor turns to venkman
you know why all these things are happening
we tried to tell you last night but mr
hard on over here packed us off to the loony bin
hardemeyer flips out
this is preposterous
you cant seriously believe all this mumbo jumbo
its the twentieth century for crying out loud
viciously to venkman look mister i dont know what this stuff is or how you got it all over the museum but you better get it off and i mean
he pounds the wall of slime with his fist and they all watch in amazement as his fist goes through the wall and he is sucked bodily through the slime
only his shoes can be seen embedded in the slime
to venkman okay just tell me what you need
with the city skyline in the b
the ghostbusters prepare their equipment
each of them dons a makeshift backpack consisting of tanks hoses nozzles and an abundance of gauges valves and regulators
venkman looks up at the statue of liberty looming above them
kind of makes you wonder doesnt it
if shes naked under that toga
shes french you know
theres nothing under that toga but tons of iron and steel
stantz is looking worried
i hope we have enough stuff to do the job
only one way to find out
to stantz ready teddy
they enter the statue
the ghostbusters are working from the iron staircase that spirals straight up feet inside the hollow super structure of the statue
spengler and winston are busy assembling hundreds of wires connected to various relays on the interior surface of the statue
venkman and stantz are mounting large auditorium loudspeakers near the top of the staircase
they finish the installation then stantz dons one of the new backpacks and gives the order
lets frost it
they begin hosing the inside of the statue with the psycho reactive slime
janine watches as louis wearing a ghostbuster uniform slings a heavy proton pack onto his back
im not sure this is such a good idea
do they know youre doing this
oh yeah sure no
but theres really not much to do here and they might need some back up at the museum
youre very brave louis
she kisses louis and he gets extremely self conscious
uh oh well i better hurry
he rushes out
louis stands on the street corner waiting for a bus
finally a bus pulls up louis climbs aboard and finds slimer behind the wheel
venkman stantz spengler and winston are standing in the observation windows in the crown of the statue
it looks like theyre on the bridge of an ocean liner then the camera pulls back to reveal the head of the statue
he plugs the main cable lead into a transformer
its all yours pete
checks his watch theres not much time left
venkman plugs the speaker cable into a walkman and gives a downbeat
giving the downbeat okay one two three four he hits play on the walkman and higher and higher booms from the huge speakers amplified by the statues vast hollow interior
the head of the statue lurches suddenly but the ghostbusters cling to the rail and manage to keep their feet
ive lived in new york all my life and i never visited the statue of liberty
now i finally get here and were taking her out for a walk
reading the giga meter weve got full power
stantz picks up a nintendo control paddle from a home video game and starts pushing the buttons
into a microphone okay libby
lets get it in gear
they feel a strong vibration and the statue starts to move
new years eve celebrants line the riverfront pointing and gawking at an incredible sight
the statue is moving up the river almost completely submerged only her head from the nose up is visible above the surface
winston looks out apprehensively
how deep does it get
that waters cold and i cant swim
i have my senior lifesaving card
with a water temperature of forty degrees wed survive approximately fifteen minutes
stantz studies a maritime navigational chart
ill keep to the middle of the channel
were okay to th street then well go ashore and take first avenue to th
are you kidding
well hit all that bridge traffic at th
im going to take nd straight up to fifth
trust me i used to drive a cab
spectators cheer wildly inspired by the sight of the statue
janosz is sitting next to dana still wheedling her with promises and self serving logic
time is running out dana
soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine and vigos
well mainly vigos
but we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship
we dont have a relationship
marry me dana and together we will raise vigo as our son
there are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god
im sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment
and perhaps a car and free parking
i hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul
i could never forgive what youve done to me and my child
many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance but after a while i believe we could learn to love each other
think about it
id rather not
people are jammed together shoulder to shoulder filling times square watching the big seiko clock count down the last ten minutes to midnight
suddenly they look down broadway and see a magnificent sight
the statue of liberty is walking up broadway approaching nd street with higher and higher booming from the speakers inside
a great cheer goes up and the crowd goes wild with joy dancing and singing along with the music
spengler reads the giga meter
the positive gevs are climbing
patting the statue they love you lib
keep it up
the avenue has been closed to traffic and barricades placed blocking all the side streets
a squadron of police motorcycles comes speeding around the corner at nd street and proceeds up fifth avenue in the direction of the museum
then music is heard booming in the distance the ground shakes and the statue of liberty comes walking around the corner onto fifth avenue followed by a wildly cheering throng
the ghostbusters can see the museum ahead
so far so good
worried im worried
the vibrations could shake her to pieces
we should have padded her feet
i dont think they make nikes in her size
were almost there lib
to stantz step on it
the statues huge foot comes down and squashes a car
the ghostbusters look down at the flattened car
shouts out the window my fault
shouts shes new in town
janosz is painting the last of the mystical symbols on the babys chest
the people still in the square start counting off the last ten seconds to midnight and the new year
a strange light spreads over the painting
as the light moves onto his face vigo spreads his arms wide and his upper body starts to emerge from the canvas
soon my life begins
then woe to the weak all power to me the world is mine
the babys body begins to glow as vigo reaches out for it
then suddenly a dark shadow falls across the skylight
janosz looks up
the statue of liberty is looming over the skylight looking down on janosz with an expression of righteous anger on its face
kneeling beside the museum the statue draws back its mighty right arm and smashes the skylight with its torch
janosz retreats from the shower of broken glass as the ghostbusters come sliding down ropes into the studio and confront janosz with their new weapons
quick as a flash dana seizes the moment dashes across the studio and snatches the baby from vigos outstretched arms
to janosz happy new year
vigo bellows in rage
janosz steps in front of the painting
feel free to try something stupid
janosz sneers trusting the invincibility of vigo
you pitiful miserable creatures
you dare to challenge the power of darkness
dont you realize what you are dealing with
you are like the buzzing of flies to him
sighs oh johnny
did you back the wrong horse
with that the ghostbusters fire their slime blowers and hose janosz from head to toe blowing him into the corner
then they turn to vigo
he is now almost completely out of the painting but still held from the knees down
he spits and rages at the ghostbusters trying to unleash his magic powers
they stand fast secure in the knowledge that vigos power has been neutralized by the good will of the people
vigi vigi vigi you have been a bad little monkey
the whole citys together on this one
we took a vote
everybodys down on you you know
arming his slime blower say goodnight now
suddenly vigo grabs stantz by the neck and holds him up as a shield
youll hit ray
strangling do it
just do it
winston fires and hoses both vigo and ray
he bellows and drops ray then falls back into the painting
the paint turns liquid melts off the canvas and runs onto the floor revealing another painting underneath it
venkman spengler and winston rush over to ray and kneel beside him
he is completely covered with slime and motionless
examining him hes breathing
winston wipes the slime off rays face and ray opens his eyes
ray ray how do you feel man
smiles lovingly groovy
ive never felt better in my life
weve got to live with this
they pull him to his feet
i love you guys
youre the best friends ive ever had
he hugs them each in turn leaving them slimed as well
venkman recoils in disgust
hey i just had this suit cleaned
indicating janosz take care of the wiggler will you
venkman crosses to dana who is snuggling the baby
she hugs venkman
what is this a love in
notes the symbols painted on the babys body hey sailor
i think the tattoos are a little much dont you
he picks up the baby
to venkman i think he likes you
i think i do too
finally came to your senses huh
they hug and kiss
they help janosz to his feet
hes dazed but unhurt
restored to normalcy what happened
calmly sir you had a violent prolonged transformative psychic episode
but its over now
want a coffee
extremely nice thats very kind of you
to stantz hes fine ray
physically intact psychomagnetherically neutral
is that good
its where you want to be
as they exit they stop to examine the painting that was concealed by vigos self portrait
late renaissance i think
caravaggio or brunelleschi
staring at it theres something very familiar about this painting
its a beautiful painting in the high renaissance style depicting four archangels hovering protectively over a cherubic baby
one holds a harp one an olive branch the third a book and the last a sword
most remarkably their faces bear an uncanny resemblance to venkman stantz spengler and winston
a city bus pulls up near the museum and louis steps off
he waves his thanks to slimer who is behind the wheel
to slimer okay so monday night well get something to eat and maybe go bowling
can you bowl with those little arms
slimer grunts and slobbers a reply flexing his scrawny biceps
okay i have to go save dana
ill see you later
the ghostbusters are greeted by wild cheering and applause as they come out the main entrance with dana and the baby
everybody starts singing auld lang syne
louis picks his way through the celebrating crowd and finds the ghostbusters
am i too late
no youre right on time
stantz pops the cork on a bottle of champagne and hands it to him
hardemeyer staggers out of the museum covered in slime
he looks at the celebrating crowd and his eyes fill with tears
weepy happy new year everybody
he joins in on auld lang syne
the statue of liberty is sprawled inert on her back in the park behind the museum her toga up over her knees
the mayor looks nearly suicidal
the ghostbusters stand beside him commiserating
shes all right
shes just sleeping it off
stricken we just had it restored
this probably isnt a good time to bring this up but the last time we did a job for the city you stiffed us
handing the mayor an invoice this is a bill for tonights job
the mayor looks at it and gasps at the amount
this is way too much
hands the bill back to venkman we wont pay
venkman looks at the statue
to stantz i think she looks pretty good here dont you
yeah and a lot easier to get to than that island
realizing he has no alternative the mayor sighs and takes the bill back
all right all right
if you can wait until monday ill issue you a check
the sun is shining brightly and liberty is back on her pedestal where she belongs
the mayor and a host of officials are commemorating her return
the ghostbusters dana janine and louis are there as honored guests
looking up at the statue pretty impressive huh
musing its probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country
from where neptune
they came from ostrov in eastern poland
ive been there
good party town
in a similarly reflective mood my great grandparents were swiss
i still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived
oh right you told me that
they came to america seeking other kinds of cheese as i recall
how about you winston
my people werent taking any pictures from those slave ships man
and there wasnt any statue in charleston harbor to welcome them either
what are you dana
miss blue blood
her familys been here since the year
thats not true
whats your story pete
im a little of everything
some irish some german some french dutch the women in my family slept around
and thats what made this country great
thats a terrible thing to say
its a free country
looking up at the statue thanks lib
they all look up at the statue
slimer flies out one of the observation windows theme music kicks in and the camera pulls up and away from the island to a high shot of the statue lower
manhattan and the shining sea beyond
