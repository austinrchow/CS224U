written by christopher butler an attractive female scientist in a gore spattered lab coat moves fearfully along a wall passing benches strewn with broken lab equipment
her ample bosom heaves as she pants nervously mascara rimmed eyes darting to and fro
glass smashes on the floor nearby and melodramatic music swells
the woman backs into a shadow not noticing a pair of dead eyes catching the moonlight behind her
the music climbs to a frenzy as something groans horribly into the womans ear
she spins around on her stiletto heels as a rotted face looms out of the darkness drooling through broken teeth and lunges at her neck
close on the woman as she raises her hands and screams
eleven year old norman babcock sits on the floor watching tv
he has large piercing eyes and a messy shock of hair
the movie scene we just witnessed continues off screen with the sound of bloodcurdling screams
behind him sitting upon a sofa is grandma babcock a plump old lady squinting through thick glasses
whats happening now
the zombie is eating her head grandma
thats not very nice
whats he doing that for
because hes a zombie
thats what they do
well hes going to ruin his dinner
im sure if they just bothered to sit down and talk it through itd be a different story
norman chuckles as if the idea is absurd then winces as he hears his father shout from the kitchen
didnt i tell you to take out the garbage
tell him to turn up the thermostat too will ya
my feet are like ice
norman nods to her and shuffles over to the kitchen door
normans mother sandra babcock is emptying the dishwasher
she is in her late thirties and wears mom clothes that do no favors for her figure
his father perry babcock is older with a neatly trimmed beard trying hard to delineate chin from neck
he stands on a chair decked out in tool belt and safety goggles even though hes only changing a light bulb in a ceiling fixture
sandra smiles at her son as he makes his way silently to an overstuffed trash can as tall as he is
whatcha watching in there
sex and violence
perry glares over as norman wrestles with the garbage
cant you be like other kids your age and pitch a tent in the yard or have a healthy interest in carpentry
i thought you said kids my age were too busy shoplifting and joyriding
he hefts the bag onto the floor and ties it in a knot
breezing into the kitchen through the back door while chatting inanely on her cell phone normans older sister courtney is fifteen years old and is the bleached blonde cheerleader archetype
of every schoolboys sordid dreams
oh yeah hes r i double p e d
like a seven pack at least
she pushes her brother out of the way as he drags the garbage outside
courtney be nice
yeah she totally doesnt deserve him
i mean shes nice and i really like her but shes a complete loser
yeah i know
courtney slumps into a chair at the table twisting a strand of gum out of her mouth with a finger
norman returns inside and shuts the door pausing a moment as if thinking something over
grandma says can you turn up the heating
her feet are cold
the bubble courtney is blowing pops against her face perry rolls his eyes and groans and sandra pales
how many times do we have to go through this son
your grandmother is dead
then why do you keep on talking to her
because she talks back
o m g you are such a liar
im not making this up
she talks to me all the time
norman levels her a look that says you asked for this
she said its not very ladylike to hide photos of the high school quarterback with his shirt off in your underwear drawer
sandra and perry raise their eyebrows
i knew it
youve been sneaking around in my personal stuff
no i havent
grandma told me
you are the worst
courtney brimming with outrage storms out of the kitchen her ponytail wagging furiously behind her
sandra kneels down beside norman with a wearily sympathetic smile
norman i know you and grandma were very close but we all have to move on
grandmas in a better place now
no shes not shes in the living room
perry throws his arms in the air swaying on the chair
your grandmother was old and sick and she died
thats all there is to it
perry this is just part of the mourning process
stop indulging him
im nothing if im not liberal but that limp wristed hippie garbage needs to be nipped in the bud
norman sighs and steps between his parents as they argue
he mutely heads out of the room
the argument in the kitchen continues slightly muted
this behavior might be okay with your side of the family but im not putting up with it anymore
oh not this again
pan up to find a light go on in normans bedroom window
norman sits on his bed using a couple of zombie action figures to act out his parents ongoing discussion which carries upstairs
norman gets up off the bed and approaches the door
this isnt the west coast sandra people talk
hes just sensitive perry
oh please sensitive is writing poetry and being lousy at team sports
i wont have him turn out like that uncle of yours
if that crazy old tramp has been around here putting ideas in normans head
perry no ones had anything to do with uncle prenderghast in years
i bet he doesnt even know what norman looks like
norman quietly closes the door and the room goes black
close on a faded photograph of norman held in the grimy hand of mr prenderghast
he stands over a dusty desk scattered with pictures of norman sandra and older family members
he is in a dark study a wall to wall trove of curious miscellanea and dumpster dived junk
not much time not much time
he pulls an old leather bound book out from the mess and traces a finger over a woodcut illustration on its cover an ethereal woman lying beneath a cluster of
wincing with pain the man drops the book and clutches at his chest coughing and gasping horribly
camera pans to a wall covered in countless photographs newspaper clippings and scrawled occult markings
it is a shrine of sorts a madmans recondite genealogy project and at its center is a photograph of norman posing with his family on vacation
zoom in to the photograph hurtling past the babcocks and through dense trees further and further into a dark forest
norman opens bleary eyes turns off his zombie hand alarm clock and slides out of bed
dressed for school norman pauses at the front door and turns to look at the sofa in the living room
he waves happily and grandma smiles back
courtney passes him as she comes down the stairs in the opposite direction
she also stops to look at the sofa but to her eyes it is empty
she sneers contemptuously
norman ambles past houses and lawns spotted with small town america detritus cheap plastic lawn furniture peeling paint fences and cookie cutter topiary
here the quaint colonial buildings are mostly in disrepair their picket fences rotten or daubed in graffiti
norman is watched dubiously by the occasional passer by as he shouts amiable greetings to people who simply arent there
hows it goin
im kind of late for school
i need to go
hi nice to see you guys
sorry i gotta run
at one street corner norman bends over a gutter
he is watched curiously by a man retrieving his morning paper across the other side of the street
mans pov norman crouches over the flattened remains of raccoon road kill
hey there little buddy
he realizes he is being stared at and slowly turns to face the onlooker then hurries away
though no one else sees them to normans eyes a whole host of ghosts are meandering through the streets
yeah good to see you
how you doin
hi mrs hardman
you look nice today
i like what youve done with your hair
does anyone smell burning
hey peace man
as you were soldier
sir yes sir
yo norman you playin hookie
no no im just late for school
sorry i gotta go
to mobster ghost how you doin
hey how you doin
a little further along norman nods pleasantly to the ghost of a parachutist impaled in the branches of a roadside tree
hows it hanging
havent heard that one before
well its a nice day
its industrial days now rusted behind it blithe hollow has become a run down tourist town celebrating its heritage with lame fetes and crass knick knacks
a massive billboard beside the main square reads blithe hollow a great place to hang
illustrated by a group of waving puritans beside an equally cheerful witch hanging from a gallows
across the street a huge banner suggests this year is particularly important for the town blithe hollow bewitchin years
the town center is lacking in charm its historical buildings subsumed into a vulgar modern thoroughfare with gaudy witch themed shop fronts and cracked sidewalks
everywhere norman walks the witch theme is prevalent
cars have bumper stickers that extol such witticisms as my other car is a broom
theres a dingy bar the bar gento and a greeting card store called best witches
norman hurries past sheriff hooper a heavyset black woman and deputy dwayne lanky and awkward and looking like hed rather be elsewhere
watch and learn
parking violation is my middle name
i thought it was rhona
they glance up disdainfully as norman passes by
clearly in this town norman has something of a bad reputation
norman walks up a tree lined path that leads to a squat school building
out front the name blithe hollow middle school is carved into an ugly hunk of granite
school kids line the path in front of norman a gauntlet of jeering merciless pre pubescent horror
norman takes a deep breath as he begins his daily walk of ridicule
most of the kids give him a wide berth but others sneer and whisper as he passes
a bell rings the start of the school day and everyone makes a bee line for the building
someone barges norman with their shoulder knocking his backpack to the ground
other kids snicker as they step over him
as the last of them head through the lobby doors norman is left alone on the path
norman bends down to retrieve his spilled possessions and a dark shape beyond the gate catches his eye
normans pov mr prenderghast barely visible as he stands within the shadow of a tree stares back at him
norman frowns and squints his eyes but now sees only trees and shadows so he continues up the steps
an expanse of unevenly lacquered floor scuffed by scores of dragged heels
rows of dented lockers line the walls
norman stands before his locker across which someone has daubed the word freak in marker
clearly something of a daily ritual he reaches inside takes out a bottle of surface cleaner and a rag and proceeds to wipe it off
across the hallway another kid is removing graffiti from his locker
neil is overweight with frizzy red hair and is busily rubbing a handkerchief over the word fatty
he watches norman with interest
a voice behind his shoulder gives norman a start
hey ghost jerk
you know what
norman turns to find textbook bully alvin the only th grader in his class who shaves looming over him
he is flanked by a couple of leering sycophants one of whom wears a t shirt emblazoned with team alvin
what do you want alvin
why dont you see some more ghosts goober
the kids laugh uproariously encouraging alvin to show off some more
alvin points to a fly that has landed on the locker beside him
he swats it flat with his hand
talk to that
the kids around alvin burst into laughter
that is so alvin
the bullies strut away content in the psychological damage theyve managed to inflict
that was good right guys
norman mutters as they leave but not loud enough so as anyone might hear
flies dont talk
across the hall neil continues to watch with sympathy but he is already being hurried along by his friend salma a nerdy indian kid with braces
neil come on
amidst stacked bleachers foam mats and stray dodge balls a crudely constructed stage fills one end of the gymnasium
mediocre art class scenery represents a colonial town complete with plywood hills chapel and crescent moon dangling perilously from a basketball hoop
in a directors chair far too small for the job is mrs henscher an imposing woman with spectacles and beret who looks like she smells of too much perfume
at the front of the stage wearing a pilgrim hat and carrying a large scroll is norman
he is surrounded by kids whose attempts at home made period costume leave a lot to be desired
you stink of illiteracy
dont any of you know anything about the history of this town
mrs henscher tries her best to remain unfazed
puritans were strict and devout settlers who came here to build a home a place without sin
what is it now salma
salma is holding her hand up
she looks like the wicked witch of the west
even beneath green makeup and plastic warty nose it is clear she is not best pleased
why is the witch always a hideous old crone with a pointy hat and a broomstick
i dont believe its historically accurate mrs henscher
mrs henschers knuckles clench white around her script
she attempts an understanding smile in the same way a shark might
its not supposed to be
its supposed to sell postcards and key chains
so lets try it again
top of page six norman
norman skips ahead on his scroll
the founding fathers of blithe hollow discovered an evil witch amongst them
no no norman with gusto
waving her arms theatrically she bellows normans lines milking every syllable for effect
they put her on trial and hanged her
but the vengeful witch cursed her accusers seven of them in all to die a horrible and gruesome death and rise from their graves as the living dead their souls
doomed to an eternity of damnation
now i want you to try that again but with conviction
my reputation is at stake here and i wont have this turn out like that wretched kabuki debacle of oh nine
as she launches into her lecture norman notices a change in the room
the lights dim the wind outside picks up and indistinct shapes flicker at the corners of his eyes
norman glances around at the other kids on the stage to see if they are seeing what he is seeing
for a split second the children are replaced with faded figures in real puritan dress
seven solemn figures
as he turns around nervously norman sees the suggestion of another place fizzing in and out of the shadows
are you listening to me boy
norman is brought back to the real world with a start and nods timidly from behind his scroll
sorry mrs henscher
so am i
now unless theres any other issues let us resume
they put her on trial and hanged her
neil turns excitedly to norman
this is my moment
he shuffles toward salma and swings his branch around not realizing alvin has slung the hangmans noose around normans neck
norman is yanked off balance and staggers into neil who keels over rigid branch arms unable to stop his fall
he lands on top of salma her kicking legs sticking out from under him as though dorothys house had just landed on stage
the kids break into uncontrollable laughter
mrs henscher flings her script into the air her face beet red
oh you useless bunch of
the school bell rings drowning out her howling voice
as kids hotfoot it out of the building as quickly as possible norman stands pitiably in front of his locker
fresh graffiti reads see you tomorrow freak
norman heads for the door and pretends not to hear when neil shouts out behind him
norman wait up
norman keeps going but neil quickly catches up beaming intently at the side of his head
i keep telling you neil
i like to be alone
so do i
lets do it together
you shouldnt let them get you down
they always do stuff like that to me
because im fat
and my allergies make my eyes leak
and i sweat when i walk too fast
and i have a lunchbox with a kitten on it
and i have irritable bowel syndrome
i guess theres a whole bunch of stuff
doesnt it bother you
you cant stop bullying its part of human nature
if you were bigger and more stupid youd probably be a bully too
its called survival of the thickest
norman and neil walk away from the school along a tree lined street at the end of which stands a huge commemorative statue
it is a grotesque effigy of the evil witch from the local legend
the boys stop
it seems to be coming from the witch
that statue just pissst at us
wild eyed mr prenderghast suddenly leaps in front of them startling them as he staggers closer
you know who i am
the weird stinky old bum who lives up the hill
points to norman i was asking him
i was told not to talk to you
mr prenderghast steps in front of neil leaning closer to norman and whispering conspiratorially
and you know why youre not supposed to talk to me
norman tries to back away
i can see ghosts too
and i know thats not all youve been seeing lately is it
things you cant quite explain
strange faces peering through the veil
normans eyes widen further
and ill bet no one told you about the witchs curse did they
actually were learning about it in school
im a tree
mr prenderghast impatiently turns his back on neil and leans close to norman
theres something you really need to know
this is the most important thing you will ever hear
the fate of everyone depends on it
now listen close
the witchs curse is real and youre the one who has to stop it
mr prenderghast grabs normans arm and leans closer
youve gotta use your gift of talking to the dead
he breaks into a hacking cough face turning beet red and bloodshot eyes bulging
because if you dont the witchs ghost
and this is the most important thing of all
you have to go up to the old graveyard and
leave him alone
an apple bounces off mr prenderghasts head
he turns to find neil standing behind them on the path lunchbox open in his hand providing leftover low carb ammunition
dont make me throw this hummus
mr prenderghast thinks better of it and turns to flee the scene
he hisses out of the side of his mouth at norman
this aint done with
youll see it soon enough
watch for the sign
as he hobbles away neil peers down the street after the old man
jeez what a dirty old creep
hes my uncle
so is it true
norman just stares at him
can you see ghosts
all the time
do you think you can see my dog bub
he was run over by an animal rescue van
tragic and ironic
we buried him in the yard
could you see him
norman frowns disbelievingly completely taken aback
neil forcibly drags norman up the front driveway of a pastel painted house
a pair of legs spotted in oil stick out from beneath a pimped up camper van
neils brother mitch calls out from under the van
were gonna go play with the dead dog in the garden and were not even gonna have to dig him up first
mitch sits up
hes a strapping six foot jock with tattooed biceps
the kind of guy who wears year round flip flops
whatd you say
mitch pulls his brother aside so as to exclude norman who stands awkwardly a little way away surrounded by cheery lawn ornaments and ineptly manicured topiary
neil isnt he that weird kid
yknow look at me i talk to ghosts so people will pay attention to me
mitch makes a goofy face and twitches farcically
can you stop doing that
its kinda stupid
now listen to me you dont need to be hanging out with weird people
thats a tip
neil scowls at his brother
dont blow this for me mitch
this ones not weird
he talks to dead people
neil has had enough and defiantly walks away from his brother
neil rummages around in the bushes of his back yard surrounded by a gloriously tasteless menagerie of lawn ornaments
norman stands slightly to one side surveying the rows of plastic gnomes and wondering if he should have gone straight home after all
hes around here somewhere
so does everyone come back as a ghost
this level of interest is new to him
my grandma told me its usually people who still have stuff to figure out
or sometimes its the ones who died suddenly or in a bad way
a bark and norman turns to see a translucent puppy wagging its tail cheerfully despite being chopped neatly into two halves
is he there
hows he look
bub barks then his front half notices his tail and runs behind to sniff his own backside
bub bounds over to neil runs clean through his chubby calves then doubles back for another try
hes happy to see you
whos a good boy huh
can he feel it if i pet him
yeah i guess
neil bends over and kisses the air by his ankles making a coochy coo face
thats not his chin
neil stops mid smooch and quickly stands up
norman watches as neil picks up a stick and waves it in front of bubs nose even though he cant see him
go get it
he cant fetch it yknow
yeah well its still fun
bring it back
go get it bub
close on norman as he watches neil toss the stick back and forth across the garden
the stick lands near his feet and he bends down to pick it up
why dont you try
cos i dont really uh
you can go
no no its fun
no i dont want to
you throw it
its really easy
no its okay
you can throw it
no cmon its really fun
you go first
no you try it
i already went like fifty times
okay what do i do
you get the stick you pull it back and you throw it
norman throws it and accidentally hits neil in the head knocking him over
as norman runs over to him neil lies on his back giggling the stick held between his teeth
i fetched it
close on norman as a smile creeps across his face and he starts to laugh
are you okay
cut wide as the two kids enjoy their play the sun above them breaking through the clouds in a bright blue sky
panting and wheezing mr prenderghast staggers into his study slams the door behind him and heads for his desk
ill show him and that scary little fat kid
he shakily rummages around the collected papers and trinkets and pulls out the leather bound book all the time grumbling crazily
doesnt he realize were running out of t
with a strangled croak he clutches dizzily at his chest then keels over backwards stiffly hitting the floor with a thump
silence then a stream of spectral orbs sputter out of him sculpting his shape in the air
with a gasp mr prenderghasts corpse sucks the spirit back in and he staggers back to his feet
he croaks again this time for real crashing back down onto the ground
the ghostly shape re emerges from the body
he blinks his eyes looking around as if hes just been woken from a deep sleep then down at the defunct body lying at his feet
lit by spotlights a large banner over the entrance reads the witchs curse presented by blithe hollow middle school drama society written produced and directed for the stage by margot
a notice beneath it reads spelling bee next wensday
a chorus of kids voices can be heard singing from inside belting out an operatic rendition of donovans season of the witch
rows of plastic chairs in front of the spotlit stage are occupied by expectant families
among the sea of faintly buzzing video cameras and a ripple of applause sandra politely smiles at the acting talents of other peoples children
next to her perry struggles to fit a battery into his camera
great now well never get to remember this moment
angle on stage as salma in full witch get up waves her hands theatrically at the other children
i curse you accusers to die a horrible and gruesome death and rise from your graves as the living dead your souls doomed to an eternity of damnation
the pilgrims who arent dying and rising from the dead begin to menace salma with their farming implements and begin a slow ominous chant
kill the witch
kill the witch
sandra nudges her husband and cheerily points toward the stage
gosh arent they adorable
norman hears a hooting sound from above
an owl with big glowing eyes wheels down over the audience from the beams of the gymnasium
norman glances around wondering why no one else seems to notice as it glides low and alights in the papier mache branches on neils head
it turns to norman and hoots
he looks down from it and catches neils eye
neil makes a puzzled expression
kill the witch
kill the witch
the chanting seems to deepen and slur and the air grows dark and thick
the shapes of the audience and the kids beside him swim around blurring like a finger pulled through oil paint
the ceiling disintegrates into clouds which crackle with lightning
under his breath oh no
all around trees have sprouted out of nowhere and through the darkness in the distance are occasional lights of small houses
this might be how this very spot looked three centuries ago
as norman turns on the spot gasping he hears a rustle in the bushes behind him and spots several dark and ominous figures in pilgrim clothing scouring the undergrowth
we know youre out there
norman stands on a twig which naturally cracks loudly and the figure turns around and points at him
more figures emerge from out of the darkness wielding hayforks
they shout threateningly and as one man surge toward him
norman turns and runs
the trees around him are shifting but theres no wind blowing the branches
limbs groan as they twist bearing down on him like ragged talons trying to stop his escape
soon he can run no further the way ahead tangled up into a wall of thorny fingers
norman finds himself pushed up against the trunk of a huge tree and a knothole grimaces at him wood splitting open into a hag like mouth
it furrows a mossy brow and speaks in a low rumbling voice
the dead are coming
norman gasps and tries to push himself away but the pursuing figures are drawing closer and theres no escape
a familiar voice whispers out of nowhere
are you okay
norman turns around to find the knothole is now neils face bulging out of the side of the tree with a look of concern
this is the last straw and norman screams
norman stands next to neil on stage eyes closed and wailing
everyone around him stares in stunned silence as still screaming he runs into the spotlight
he continues running directly off the edge of the stage and lands on the floor with a thump
for a moment no one knows quite how to react
mrs henscher quizzically checks her script
normans eyes focus and he sees everyone standing around him staring
sandra pushes through the crowd
did he say the dead are coming
no no no
everyone jumps as norman abruptly sits up eyes wild
the tree told me
perrys face drains of color while the other parents murmur and mutter crowd speak for what a weirdo
norman sees their expressions of disgust and suspicion
worst of all peering around parents legs with a look of shock and fear is neil
norman catches his eye a moment and neil looks down at the ground
barely keeping his fury in check perry drives home norman sitting despondently in the back seat
this is where it stops
its one thing being a mental case in front of your family but not the whole freaking town
theres not gonna be any more talking to ghosts or grandmas or or
what is it now
i think its trees
you hear me
perry pulls the car up in the babcocks drive and gruffly climbs out of the car
this is ridiculous
i wish everyone could see what i see
i didnt ask to be born this way
perry mutters as he slams his door shut
funny neither did we
norman catches the remark and feels it hard in his gut
his mother hears it too and leans over her seat with a look of sympathy
a beat as she sees the pain in her sons face
yknow sometimes people say things that seem mean but they do it because theyre afraid
hes my dad
he shouldnt be afraid of me
sandras eyes are filled with sorrow
hes not afraid of you
hes afraid for you
sadly norman climbs out of the car
ominous clouds roll long shadows over the school building
norman stands at the bottom of the school steps trying to prepare himself for what he knows is going to be a bad day
he steels himself and sighs
norman walks the familiar gauntlet of school kids only this time the abuse is tenfold
whatd the tree tell you today norman
are the dead coming soon norman
an overhead bulb casts a dim light over chipped wall tiles and yellowed ceramic sinks with leaky faucets
the door opens and norman hurries inside a number of voices still shouting behind him
he shuts the door cutting them off and leans against it taking a breath
he heads over to the first stall
the door is locked so he takes the next one
close on alvin sitting on the toilet in the next stall scribbling obscenities on the wall to pass the time
he pauses as he hears the lid drop next door then resumes his vandalism
norman sits on the lid of the toilet pulling his knees up under his chin feeling sorry for himself
angle on toilet paper in an industrial sized roll
it jitters on its mount and begins to turn slowly on its own unspooling sheet by sheet toward the floor
norman frowns and watches as it stops unravelling and a draught of wind blows out of nowhere ruffling his hair
the toilet roll suddenly spins violently flinging the paper into the air in reams
the screws holding the dispenser to the wall rattle fiercely
the toilet underneath norman begins to shake and shudder spilling water over the floor
norman wails loudly as he jumps onto the back of the cistern
alvin is frozen in place in his stall hearing the noises and really not sure how to react to them
he glances down and sees toilet water leaking across the tiles
he quickly pulls up his pants to cover his dignity and jumps up off the toilet with a squeal
in normans stall everything stops dead and the lid of the toilet slowly creaks open
norman gasps as mr prenderghasts face stares up at him out of the toilet bowl
with some effort the old mans ghost shimmies out of the toilet eventually popping out like a cork from a bottle hovering in the air in front of normans face
yeah but i got unfinished business here
couldnt you use another stall
my ghost isnt going anywhere until i pass on my duty to another
and that would be you
no you must have it wrong
oh its you all right
ive been holding back the witchs curse for years but now im dead
it has to be you
i dont know what any of it means
before normans eyes the bathroom stall and everything beyond it is ripped away revealing thick undergrowth and tall trees
norman is suddenly sat on the toilet in the middle of a forest
it means the past is coming back to haunt you
time is running out
the anniversary of the witchs death is tonight
her ghost is going to wake up and when she does shell raise the dead
you gotta keep her in her grave
the toilet paper on the ground twists up beneath normans feet sculpting skull faces and clutching hands that reach for him as he shrinks back
but im just a kid
how am i supposed to stop it
in an instant the air and trees around him are eaten away the school bathroom reappearing through the holes
read from the book at the spot the witch was buried
the one in my hands
norman looks at the ghosts wispy hands
not these hands my other hands
the me thats at home in my study starting to smell a little funny
norman looks sick and overwhelmed but the ghost doesnt let up swirling right up to his face
get the book and read from it
before the sun sets tonight
but this is crazy
do i look crazy to you
norman pauses a beat
mr prenderghast is floating upside down various bits of bathroom detritus orbiting around him
a piece of toilet paper dangles off his nose
tell me youll do this
y you mean like the f word
i mean promise
okay okay i promise
mr prenderghasts ghost begins to disappear bubbling and melting at the edges like a burning photograph
mr prenderghast wait
alvin hearing only normans voice gingerly peeks around the corner of his stall
sorry kid im done here
im finally free
no you cant leave now
i dont understand
mr prenderghast hangs in the air a moment face scrunched up as he awaits his release cackling crazily
the ghost explodes into a million particles of light blowing open the stall door and catapulting alvin backwards across the room
the mirrors behind him crack and the light bulb shatters
from the floor alvin groggily looks up and sees norman framed in the stall with the door hanging off its hinges
he reaches over and flushes the toilet
you might want to give that a few minutes
he grabs his bag and runs out of the room
norman sprints madly for the main doors passing neil and salma who glance up from their lockers as he stumbles by
alvin tears around the corner in pursuit but neil stands in his way waving his arms indignantly
whats the big deal
dont get your bra in a twist fat boy this has nothing to do with you
keep out of my way
or ill punch you in the boobs
i dont have boobs
these are pectorals
alvin jabs him in the chest
neil swiftly steps aside
alvin reaches the door to see norman disappearing along the path as fast as he can
alvin yells after him
youre dead freakshow
do you hear me
d e d
youre gonna be so dead youre gonna have to talk to yourself when youre dead
wearing her fanciest dress sandra bustles out of the kitchen to the front door
i really dont think we should be leaving him
perry you promised me a meal that someone else microwaved
hes probably up there right now fiddling with his ouija or his orbs or whatever it is hes got up there
this is not good
norman paces his room looking pale and anxious as he hears the front door shut downstairs
everywhere he turns he finds himself face to face with some zombie related novelty from his lurid horror posters to his shelves of ghoulish action figures and its not doing
anything for his nerves
his cell phone beeps from his pocket giving him a start
he takes it out and reads a text come to the window
norman cautiously walks over and peers around the edge of the window frame
a figure stands motionless in the yard below sheets of laundry billowing off the clothes line beside it
it stares up at norman through the blank eye holes of a hockey mask
norman gasps and jumps back
with a frown he re emerges and opens the window
the figure lifts the mask and neil beams out from underneath waving excitedly
you wanna play some hockey
ive kinda got other things on my mind right now
neil looks a little uncomfortable
is it all that walking dead stuff again
mr prenderghast appeared to me in the bathroom
no his spirit
he says the witchs curse is real and i have to go up to the old graveyard to stop it
before the sun sets tonight
neil shifts uneasily as he processes
so you wanna come play a bit later
didnt you hear what i just said
yeah but i thought my idea was less likely to get us eaten
norman knows hes on his own in this
just go home neil
im better off on my own anyway
norman reaches up and closes the window
neils shoulders sag and he turns away
across the room his grandma materializes and squints her eyes through the window as neil awkwardly pulls himself over the garden fence
jeez who rattled your chains
norman isnt in the mood for any more discussion
dad says im not supposed to talk to you any more grandma
if i were a poltergeist id throw something at his head
yknow by rights im supposed to be frolicking in paradise with your grandfather but im not
norman looks up as she drifts closer to the bed
so why did you stay
i was never one for frolicking
ill bet theres no cable or canasta up there either
besides i promised id always look out for you
she smiles floating in a sitting position at the end of normans bed
she bobs gently like a balloon
for a second this seems to comfort norman but then another thought crosses his mind
so its your
in a manner of speaking
and youd do it no matter what
even if it was something really scary
grandma eyes him curiously
theres nothing wrong with being scared norman so long as you dont let it change who you are
norman thinks this over then smiles up at her again
she goes to rub his head affectionately but her ghost hand just passes right through his spiky hair
she gives him a wink and drifts away through the wall
he is still scared but now determined too
he steels himself and grabs his jacket from his bed
the tiny room is crammed full of posters pom poms plush toys and plastic trophies
pretty much everything is pink
courtney sits talking on her phone cotton buds between her toes as her painted nails dry
so i said to her girl come back and talk to me when your basket toss gets twelve thousand hits on youtube
yeah no i said that
listens and nods yeah im stuck on lame patrol
tonights gonna be a total yawn
from downstairs a door slams
courtney frowns puts her hand over the phone and shouts out
beneath a florid evening sky the babcocks drive is in darkness
pedalling furiously norman rides his bike out of the shadows into the light of the street
you better not be sneaking out you little weirdo
on a street corner two teenage girls approach alvin and pug who have laid out a breakdancing mat and a beatbox and are doing their best to impress
alvin imagines he is wowing the girls with his krumping his ham like limbs flying around and pug hollering support but in truth they watch in morbid fascination
a faint clattering sound down the road grows louder
norman suddenly thunders past them on his bike spinning alvin on the spot and knocking him onto his butt
show over alvin blunders to his feet his eyes following normans trajectory up the dark road and growls
tall conifers rise up high on either side of the road now little more than a dirt track
norman pedals up the hill and swerves skidding to a stop in the gravel
he climbs off the bike eyes fixed on a ramshackle house partially hidden in the foliage its porch door swinging and creaking eerily in the breeze
he cautiously advances past a crooked mailbox on which is written prenderghast and steps onto the wooden porch
the fading light of day spills across the floorboards and faded wallpaper of a long passage
motes of dust float around norman as he moves slowly toward a door slightly ajar muttering to himself
he quietly makes his way past all manner of objects that epitomize the state of mr prenderghasts mind a mannequin in a shopping cart a pile of broken typewriters a
suspended bag of spoons a closet full of identically soiled hobo suits a nordic track
the study is filled with teetering piles of junk and old furniture draped over in dust sheets
a crucifix hangs over a metal cot with rumpled bedding
this is evidently where the old man lived his whole life
starlight from a window picks out a macabre halo on a shape on the floor mr prenderghast dead where he fell tightly clutching a leather bound book
close on normans face as he swallows nervously and steps closer to the body
he gingerly takes hold of the book and gives a gentle tug
it holds fast in the rigor mortis grasp
he tugs harder shaking the book repeatedly the corpse shaking with it
norman spends several strenuous moments dragging the body across the floorboards mr prenderghasts head glancing off table legs and smacking repeatedly against the floorboards as norman tries to wrestle the
with a final yank the book pulls loose and gasping norman grips the book to his chest and runs to the door
norman careens through the door leaps off the porch and sprints along the wooded lane up the hill watched by alvin concealed behind some bushes
norman emerges from the woods his long shadow preceding him as the sun begins its descent behind the tall trees
he pauses and stares out across weathered tombstones poking out amidst tangles of thorns
clutching the book tight norman wrenches open the heavy gate its rusted padlock crumbling apart
eventually the track runs up to a stone slab surrounded on either side by thick bramble
norman brushes aside vines and reads an epitaph engraved into the stone norman pushes through the thick bushes into a secluded plot of land behind the slab with seven gravestones
sticking out from the undergrowth
this is it
the sun continues its descent casting an ever lengthening shadow of treetops across the graveyard
read from the book stop the curse go home and pretend this never happened
norman steels himself opens the book and starts to read
once upon a time in a far off land there lived a king and queen in a magnificent castle
he pauses confused by what hes reading
a hand reaches over his shoulder from nowhere whipping the book out of his grasp
he spins around to find alvin standing behind him
what ya got there geekula
norman launches himself at the book but alvin holds him back at arms length
give it back
cant wait to see everybodys faces when they hear about this one
nobody makes me miss out on a possible date with a girl that almost had some interest in talking to me
you got nothin to say
dang straight uh oh
thats what happens when alvin gets around here
uh oh is that alvin
uh oh alvins gonna make me run home to mommy
as norman twists and wrestles against the bully the turbulent clouds in the sky above them twist and coalesce into the vague semblance of a huge grinning face
the face of a witch
there is an enormous rumble and a flash of lightning silhouettes the boys
what is that
the wind has picked up howling through the gravestones
norman looks at the face leering out of the clouds
another violent crack of thunder and flash of light and the wind instantly cuts out
the boys stand stock still
reaching down like a colossal arm a great plume of cloud spirals over the cemetery enveloping the tumbledown chapel and seeping around the gravestones
fingers of murky fog slither across the ground occasionally pausing and hanging in the air as though sniffing it
there is something eerily playful in the movement of the tendrils
the boys are jolted as an awful high pitched scream blows through the graveyard like a shockwave pulsing through the fog like a heartbeat
norman and alvin cover their ears and cower as the fog suddenly rears up like a claw and fiercely gouges into the earth in front of the boys
silence then the ground begins to rumble beneath their feet and ripples beneath the tombstones
stone slabs grind and shift
one cracks right through the center
whats that sound
norman watches horrified as the wet earth atop one of the graves splits and a skeletal hand bursts through
norman watches as more graves bulge and break open and mud encrusted shapes begin to emerge through the earth
the air is filled with anguished moaning the glowing fog dancing and whirling about the hatching figures
the two boys are rooted to the spot mouths hanging open
close on one of the figures crawling out of the ground into a patch of moonlight
ragged and rotten it wears the mud encrusted clothes of a colonial puritan
it stares down at its hands almost in disbelief then lifts its face up to the sky and lets out a howl
thunder that sounds like deep and abysmal laughter echoes through the turbulent clouds
the boys find themselves backed up against another headstone this one engraved with the name judge hopkins
they leap aside as the ground swells beneath their feet and the dead judge punches through the dirt bolt upright
his face wears a rictus grin and he looms over the boys like the grim reaper in a powdered wig
he tilts his head curiously when he sees the book in alvins hand and hisses through yellowed teeth
norman makes a last ditch attempt at reading the book as the dead judge approaches the other zombies gathering behind him
once upon a time in a far off
once upon a
make it stop right now please
its not working
the dead judge gives a hideous growl but norman frowns confused because he can hear words
what are you doing
i think i peed my pants
survival instincts finally kick in and alvin makes a run for it scrambling through the graves toward the gate
norman follows leapfrogging over headstones
neil sits on the floor in front of a huge tv remote control in hand as the doorbell rings loudly from the hall
will you get the door
are you freeze framing moms aerobics dvd again
angle on tv with a still image of a lycra clad instructor bending over
neil quickly turns it off
the doorbell rings again
would it kill you to get off your butt and answer the door
im gonna kill them
she impatiently leans down to push open the mail slot
i know youre in there
slumber partys over dorks
the door opens and she finds herself face to navel with mitch out of the shower with a towel around his waist
um can i help you
under her breath hell yeah
courtney catches herself and quickly affects a laugh
sorry to bug you so late but does erm
checks page in hand neil live here
yeah hes my brother
your brother and my brother are like best friends
she tries to regain her composure as mitch turns away
you come here a minute
theres a girl asking for you
neils face emerges dubiously from a room down the hall
courtney flashes her widest fake grin and puts on a high pitched sing song voice
how ya doin
do you know where norman is
he kinda disappeared
i have no idea where he is
neil goes to turn around but his brother stops him short
better start talking buddy
i didnt really think he was serious about going up to the old graveyard on his own
that place is bad news
total slasher movie vibe
whyd he go up there
i dont know
maybe we should go look for him
i told you he was trouble
but i did
no its fine
but i really gotta make sure he doesnt die or anything tonight
will you help me
mitch gets an eyeful of her best damsel in distress act then sighs
i guess i should go get some clothes on
courtney gives a disappointed whine as he heads off down the hall shoving neils head as he goes
uh is norman in trouble
the front door is kicked open and norman and a near hysterical alvin rush inside slamming and locking the door behind them
are they gonna try to eat our brains
i think youll be safe
oh thank god
he manages to think this through and frowns
alvin watches curiously as norman turns his attention to the book frowning as he runs his hand over the embossed leather cover
i dont get it
why didnt it work
he opens the book and leafs through page after page of ornate calligraphy and woodcut illustrations
the story of sleeping beauty
this doesnt make any sense
his mind racing norman heads off along the hallway
where are you going
the room remains as before with mr prenderghasts corpse lying on the floor
norman enters with purpose and approaches it leaving alvin horrified in the doorway
norman crouches low over the body holding the book out in front of mr prenderghasts blank eyes
mr prenderghast i dont understand
tell me what to do
dude what are you doing
points to corpse he told me to read from the book to stop the curse
i thought it was a spell or something but
norman narrows his eyes as he sees mr prenderghasts desk still strewn with pictures and newspaper clippings
he hurries over and begins rummaging through the mess scattering papers across the floor
there has to be something
i really need to get home
ive got like a seriously early curfew
my mom gets really upset when im not
something clunks loudly from down the hall sending alvin into a desperate babbling panic
we gotta defend ourselves
we gotta shoot them in the head with like silver stakes or something
im way too awesome to get eaten
norman are you listening to me
you really have to do something
norman uncovers a couple of faded photographs of the old graveyard
one is of the seven tombstones the other is of the stone marker which reads here lies buried the beside the photos is a torn page from an old book
an engraving illustrates the seven members of the witchs trial solemnly seated at a bench within the courthouse
frowning norman glances up and sees a page from an old book tacked to the wall
it is an illustration of a hideous old crone cackling evilly
another thump from down the hall
norman looks again from the photographs in his hand to the image of the old witch
theres something hes not seeing
he looks at the pictures in front of him
the witchs grave
it wasnt there
he turns to alvin
i was reading the book in the wrong place
down the hallway another loud thump
close on the door knob rattling furiously then a crack as a mottled hand punches it right through the wood
a figure limps slowly into the hallway dragging one crippled foot behind the other
it stops halfway along and tilts its head as if listening and emits a dire moan
more shapes appear behind it in the doorway and fan out along the hallway
the boys tremble in their hiding places trying not to make a sound alvin crouched behind a stack of books and norman lying underneath the bed
the footsteps grow louder as the zombies shuffle into the room
normans pov rotten legs step up to mr prenderghasts body lying where he fell on the floorboards
two withered feet suddenly step right up to the bed
something drops onto the floor inches in front of normans face with an unpleasant slap
normans eyes bug out as he realizes it is a zombies dislodged ear
a weltered arm reaches down to grope around for the body part until norman pushes the ear as carefully as he can manage back into the zombies fingers
the hand retreats back out from under the bed
there is a loud scream as alvin unable to contain himself any longer jumps out from his hiding place and makes for the door
the corpses look up as he disappears down the hall then stagger after him
norman takes this chance to follow but the dead judge blocks his exit
they both stand quite still staring into each others eyes
the corpse tilts its head almost quizzically and its eyes widen as it notices the book under his arm
norman steps sideways to run past it but the corpse does too
both it and norman step one way then the other and back again
norman feigns one direction and quickly bolts in the other past the corpse and out the door
alvin reaches the front door and throws it open
directly in front of him is another zombie on the doorstep opening a mouth full of jagged teeth
alvin screams like a little girl smacks it ineffectually with his spatula and the door is abruptly slammed in the zombies face a surprised and muffled groan coming from the
alvin still screaming looks down to see norman beside him leaning against the door
the dead judge leads the advance of zombies down the hall toward them
norman hears his moan
norman swings the door back open the zombie on the other side moving with it teeth firmly embedded in the wood
as it attempts to pry itself free norman grabs alvin by the arm and they both dart onto the porch behind its back headed for the road
mitch drives along dark roads
neil sits behind him looking bemused while courtney in the front passenger seat extols her life history
and she said i could totally consider a career in formation swimming
but i was like i wanna do something that helps people less fortunate than me thank you very much yknow like the poor or people who are like dying or
ugly or something cuz i really think that ecology and world peace are like totally important today
do you use free weights
your deltoids are huge
ive never used deltoids in my life i swear
you can test me
neil lies back in his seat eyes rolling
kill me now
thank you for doing this mitch
he means an awful lot to me
i love him like he was a brother
he is your brother
courtney counters the backseat barbs by smiling demurely but mitchs attention has been drawn by something else
look at that sky
the wooded hill rises steeply a few miles in front of them and at its top is the old chapel
pressing down upon it huge seething thunderclouds shift into otherworldly shapes
mitch and courtney are mesmerized
neil suddenly points past mitchs face
mitch slams on the breaks twisting the wheel
running down the middle of the road blinded by the glare of the vans headlights are alvin and norman
the van swerves around them and grazes the trees the side mirror flying off as it hits a branch
mitch fights to control the van as courtney screams
that was norman
shaken mitch realizes another figure is looming out of the darkness in front of them
he slams on the brakes again but too late
the tall dirty looking figure stands stock still as the van plows straight into him
dust flies up from the wheels of the van as it skids to an eventual stop in the center of the road
mitch turns to everyone as he pulls off his seat belt
is everyone okay
courtney and neil answer in unison both of them upside down in their seats with their legs sticking up in the air
mitch trying to stay calm looks in his rear view mirror and sees a prone shape on the ground some yards back
mitch climbs out of the van and sees the figure lying still on the moonlit road
he nervously jogs over to it
as he gets closer mitch can see the man more clearly
he is wrapped in filthy tattered clothing of a bygone era and is covered in dirt
flies buzz around him
he hunkers down and is immediately hit by the stench
a mud encrusted face stares up at him
angle on the van as courtney leans her head out
is he dead or what
i dont know
hes not moving
the figures head lets out a faint gasp
hes still breathing
mitch reaches out to gently lift the figures head but as he does there is a crunch and it comes off in his hands
so hes okay
what did you just say
mitch looks from the head back to the van then at the head again
he licks his lips nervously as he thinks
does anyone know cpr
further down the road norman runs back toward the van alvin still in tow
he sees mitch ahead of him getting dizzily to his feet still holding the head
the head in mitchs hands suddenly gasps again opening its mouth
mitch shrieks as the headless figure on the road sits up and reaches out its arms
mitch drop kicks it like a football
it flies wailing into the bushes
as if struck by the same blow the rest of the corpse staggers backwards
alvin and norman run past him toward the van bustling past courtney and clambering inside
more corpses are emerging from the trees on either side of the road
she screams and leaps back into the van as mitch leaps into the drivers seat beside her
did you see that
that was insane
i know right
i kicked that like a hundred yards
norman what just happened
i swear okay
we saw them burst out of their graves
he realizes mitch and courtney are staring at him and tries to disguise his raw panic with nonchalance
just so you know i totally saved his life and i could totally save yours
sorry who are you
im in his class
norman not so easily distracted from the problem at hand as the others glances uneasily through the window
normans pov the zombies lurch arthritically toward the van groaning and gurgling
maybe we should actually drive away now
mitch starts the engine with a yell just as the nearest zombie leers in through the window
close on the front wheel spinning and squealing
the van spits out a cloud of exhaust fumes as it accelerates away
a beat as the smoke clears
the soot covered zombies splutter as they cough up whats left of their lungs
they turn from one to the other awaiting direction from their leader
but the dead judge is nowhere to be seen
a zombie points down the winding road where the woods eventually thin out into leafy suburban drives
the ragged shape of the judge is clinging to the back of the van thrashing around and wailing as it picks up speed
the zombies quietly watch until the van moves out of sight behind the trees then turn their attention to the lights of the town center below them
they weigh up their options and moaning shuffle toward civilization
further down the hill sheriff hooper is taking a break from ticketing borderline traffic violations by drinking a giant malt shake in a plastic cup
she leans against her parked motorcycle squinting up at the unnatural clouds
pesky kids with their cell phones burning up the oh zone thats what this is
she finishes her shake and throws the non recyclable cup into the bushes
mitchs van shoots past at high speed in a cloud of dust
hooper watches the van tear away the dark shape of the dead judge visibly clinging to the back doors his voluminous cape flapping out behind him like a windsock
unseen by the kids the dead judge claws his way up the rear doors of the van by his ragged fingernails
courtney lets out an infuriated growl
i just knew something like this was going to happen tonight
wow cos that zombie bit really threw me
courtney turns in her seat and glares at her brother
why dyou have to go and get everyone involved in all your weird stuff
well you werent supposed to follow me were you
when im nervous i get mouth diarrhoea
oh my gosh i think im having an aneurism
this is so typical of you
you dont understand
im the only one who can stop this courtney
oh i understand
i understand that this is all getting completely out of
the vans sunroof is suddenly ripped open and the dead judges arm reaches down into the vehicle clawing inches above courtneys head
the dead judge leans further into the van moaning horribly
he seems to have his sights set on norman and reaches one arm down toward norman and the book peeking out of his shoulder bag
norman shrinks back as the zombie groans horribly
alvin disappears behind the back seat with a whimper but neil valiantly leaps into the fray wrestling the clawing fingers away from his friend
i dont know
i dont know
youre the oldest
mitch hears a siren wail out behind him and looks in his mirror to see the flashing light of hoopers bike
hooper pulls level with the passenger seat window waving angrily
pull over the vehicle
the dead judge leans further into the van neil hanging off him like a pendulum
how do we stop them
norman looks again at the book in his hands
im supposed to read from the book at the witchs grave
weve got to go back to the graveyard
she wasnt buried with the others
i dont know where else to look
well you better think of something quick
norman wracks his brain
i have an idea
salma sits at her computer in an immaculately tidy bedroom
even her collection of dolls are flawlessly groomed and sit on a shelf looking like theyre waiting to be called in for an interview
salma talks into her cell phone with an expression of withering disdain
so norman let me get this straight you guys all go on this big supernatural adventure and youre calling me in the middle of the night because you need someone
to help you do your homework
norman talks into his cell phone occasionally ducking as neils flailing limbs are shaken from side to side by the growling upside down zombie hanging above their heads
hooper steers her bike closer and swings her backside into the side of the van in an attempt to ram it off the road
the van lurches flipping the judge up and over the front of the vehicle planting his face with a squelch against the windscreen
neil drops back down onto his seat
the dead judges arm torn off at the shoulder is still clutched in his hands
he stares down at it wide eyed as it wriggles like an animal in his grasp
the dead judge slides slowly down the windscreen of the van with a dull squeak
mitch do something
mitch flicks on the windscreen wipers which wipe the zombies rotten flesh from side to side across the glass
mitch and courtneys eyes follow the judges movements from side to side
behind them neil squeals as the dismembered arm crawls all over him fingers scuttling like a spiders legs
the arm frees itself from neil and turns on norman leaping at him like a viper
norman holds the book up as a shield and manages to swat the zombie arm away flipping it across the front seat where it lands on the back of mitchs
mitch screams as the rotten hand clamps down onto the top of his head and madly tries to shake it off
it hangs onto him grimly bony fingers hooked around his nostrils
with mitch no longer steering the van swerves crazily across the road shaking the dead judge off the windscreen
he disappears under the front of the vehicle his one remaining arm clinging onto the underside
norman shouts pleadingly into the phone as he and neil are flung violently from side to side across the back seat
we need to find out where the witch is buried
i went to the old graveyard but her grave wasnt there
people found guilty of witchcraft werent considered people anymore
norman your witch was buried someplace else
in an unmarked grave
if you cared to pay attention some of the time you would know that we covered this in fifth grade history class
yknow i would google this myself if there wasnt a year old dead guy trying to rip my face off
with a sigh salma types at her computer
it says here she was tried in the old town hall on main street
there may be a record of her execution and burial in their archives
norman listens intently then shouts over to mitch still struggling with the zombie hand gripping his face
she said go to the town hall
mitch hangs a sharp right and accelerates off the road and into thick undergrowth sending up showers of twigs and thorns
close on his heels hooper swerves her bike around in pursuit
the six zombies inexorably continue their march breaking cover from outlying woodland into the suburban streets of the town proper
at the bottom of a long driveway spotlit by a street lamp mrs henscher is taking out the trash in her bathrobe
she looks up from her garbage as the zombies approach
her face is caked in a terrifying green avocado face mask
barely a few feet in front of her a similarly green face stares back only this one has been dead for three hundred years
henscher screams bolting down the street like a runaway locomotive
the van ploughs through bracken and bushes at breakneck speed
a little way behind hooper careens precariously in the vans wake
mitch finally manages to pry the dead judges arm off his head
he throws it thrashing around violently over his shoulder
alvin lifts his face tentatively over the edge of the back seat to see whats going on
the zombie arm plants him in the eye sending both sprawling against the floor
alvin squeals as the arm snakes around his neck into a bizarre approximation of a wrestling hold
mitch swerves his van down the hill toward the more affluent suburbs of the town
hoopers police bike bounces along behind them red light flashing and siren wailing
perry and sandra babcock are driving home from their evening out
neither look especially happy
i really think it might help if you tried to see things from his point of view
i dont want to
the babcocks discussion continues as they drive
perry not believing in the afterlife is like not believing in astrology
i have no idea what youre talking about
seriously where did you learn that
perry rolls his eyes and groans
mitchs van explodes out of the thinning woods and back on to the winding hill road
hooper careens through the trees behind it but fails to make the turn and smashes through a fence across the other side of the road into a suburban back yard
splinters of fence showering down in her wake
scattering lawn ornaments plastic garden toys and deck furniture hooper rides directly up a kids slide shooting high up into the air like a rocket
preceded by an ear splittingly guttural wail mrs henscher runs through the streets waving her arms about hysterically
moments later the babcocks station wagon pulls around the corner
mitchs van screeches through the intersection swerving in front of the babcocks station wagon which veers wildly as perry brakes hard
he leaps out of the car as the van drives away
where are the police when you need them
hoopers bike hurtles through the air and bounces off the hood of the station wagon with a crunch
before perry can react he is buried under the mass of sheriff hooper dropping like a meteorite onto his head
the kids hanging on for dear life hear a loud crunch from the back of the van
they all turn to see the vans rear doors ripped open
silhouetted in the space is the one armed dead judge cape muddied and torn from his crawling back out from the vehicles undercarriage
the zombie lunges toward the startled kids and moans
mitch turns his attention back to the road ahead but too late and he yells as green faced mrs henscher runs squealing into the vans headlights
mitch throws all his weight onto the wheel tires screaming as the van misses henscher by inches
the violence of the turn flings the dead judge backwards like a slingshot disappearing out of the doors and shattering into a dozen pieces as he smashes into the hard
having completely lost control mitchs van ploughs through cookie cutter back yards
it bounces down the hill flipping over and over the kids inside tossed around like rag dolls
somewhat the worse for wear it eventually comes to a stop in a parking lot neatly crashing into an empty space
the kids clamber out of the far side of the van
oh my gosh
im gonna be sick
oh i broke a nail
as alvin climbs out he gingerly holds up the judges arm as if it were a dead animal and dangles it limply in front of his face
alvin the zombie slayer
i got you
the hand suddenly bends back on itself slaps him on the face and as he squeals it drops to the ground and skitters away into the shadows
mitch sizes up whats left of his van and bids a tearful farewell
baby im so sorry
youll be alright
were gonna get through this together
courtney pouts moodily when she realizes the tender words arent for her
norman looks up at the sky
a thick bank of cloud looms over the town and in its center is the unmistakable otherworldly face ebbing in and out of visibility and grinning horribly
neil hums his very own action movie score as he runs to follow norman out of the parking lot
now the geeks are in charge
the kids make toward the parking lot exit
the town center retains even less charm when the sun goes down and its remaining denizens are now drunk high or looking for trouble
provided one requires alcohol junk food or pharmaceuticals its the place to be
a ruddy faced drunk slob guy inserts a few coins in a vending machine at the end of an alley and waits as the metal coil inside curls a candy
bar toward the front of the machine
the man notices the approaching figures further down the back street and frowns
he turns back to the machine waiting
the zombies draw closer groaning and the man fidgets uncomfortably
the man begins whimpering
the candy bar slowly shifts forward
the zombies are close enough to touch
the man yells and runs away leaving the candy bar to drop to the machines trough with a clang
a beat then still screaming the man runs back to the machine grabs his candy then runs away again
the undead emerge onto main street and slow down as they take in their surroundings
various angles on the garish town center nightlife intercut with close ups of the wide eyed zombies
two teenage girls in mini skirts walk along the curb
a pickup truck crawls by driven by red necks who wolf whistle and gesture rudely
the girls giggle
in the nearby gobblers parking lot a huge woman sits in her vehicle cramming a burger into her mouth
as she bites down ketchup spatters across the inside of the windscreen like arterial spray
a corpse stands agog before a billboard
the poster is for a line of lady luck lingerie and features a buxom woman in her underwear draped over a roulette wheel
the tagline is fancy your chances
the corpses one eye pops out of its socket and dangles by its optic nerve
outside the bar gento loud music and raucous revelry blare out into the street
a group of loitering teens cluster in a group some sitting upon a stolen shopping cart others kicking a tin can from one to the other
one daubs misspelled naughty words on the wall beside them
another is attempting to use his bare hands to rip open a parking meter
another corpse stands in the light of a store window a bank of tvs showing all kinds of programs
racing car explosions scantily clad singers gyrating in music videos talking animals and viagra commercials
quick cuts of zombie close ups as they all raise rotten fingers to their mouths and scream
slob guy suddenly bursts out of the door of the bar gento dragging a group of dubious drinkers
i told you
its the witchs curse
everyone in the street freezes in place wide eyed
a couple of the zombies exchange glances waiting for the other shoe to drop
what should we do
barely skipping a beat the townsfolk shift seamlessly from shock and awe to bullish aggression
crystal pulls a pump action shotgun from somewhere about her person and scowls menacingly
kill them in the head
within seconds the seedy looking townsfolk have armed themselves with pool cues mops toilet plungers and any other household implements that can be waved threateningly and the mob advances on
the group of quivering zombies
the disembodied judges arm skitters along a secluded street eventually coming upon the rest of the dead judge sitting in the gutter trying to arrange and re attach his body
parts in the right places
having snapped his head back onto his neck the judge scoops up his remaining arm and gets unsteadily to his feet
norman leads the way but stops dead as they run headlong into a scene of zombie invasion mayhem
townsfolk fill the streets shouting and acting generally mob like
one or two of them have even got hold of burning torches from somewhere
its apocalyptic chaos
the fat woman from the drive thru runs past screaming her face and t shirt covered in blood red ketchup
oh this is awful
the zombies are like eating everyone
norman points beyond the bedlam to the dark shape of the old town hall in the plaza
they skirt around the edge of main street avoiding flying bottles and limbs as best they can
following the noise the judge staggers along some way behind
he surveys the scene as he emerges his featureless face doing a nevertheless effective job of expressing horrified shock
after a moment he comes to his senses and spies the kids in the distance
a look of resolve crosses his face turning quickly to surprise as a shot rings out nearby
the judge looks down to a large hole blown through his midriff
framed within it is crystal several feet away rifle smoking
he looks up again weighs up his chances then lets out a roar of retreat to his beleaguered companions before running off into the shadows
those zombies who havent already tried to run for cover manage to extricate themselves from the frenzy and follow the judges cry some of them breaking into a sprint
formerly the district courthouse the town hall has now been relegated to storing the local archives
it is an old timber building surrounded by graceless modern office blocks around the cobbled square
the kids race across the plaza pausing to catch their breath at the ugly witch statue in front of the town hall
they gasp as they slow their pace
is everyone alright
nobody got bitten
neil flops down heavily against the statue panting and holding his mouth
i bid dy tongue
dud dat count
norman moves toward the steps leading up to the town halls doors the rest of the gang falling into line behind him
another flash of lightning paints the kids shadows across the width of the square
norman nervously watches the clouds above them
does anyone know how to pick a lock
everyone immediately looks at alvin
picking locks is my thing
alvin walks over to a notice board beside the door upon which is a poster for a crime prevention seminar
he yanks it out of the ground hefts it through the window then reaches through to unfasten the door latch
the kids hurry through the door
the lobby is dark but moonlight glistens off polished wood through a lofty circular window
norman shouts out from the other side of the lobby where he stands beside a door labelled hall of records
this is it
now we can find out where the witch was buried
norman pushes his shoulder against the door and steps inside
the door swings open and reveals a labyrinth of shelves and glass cabinets stretching out into the shadows in front of him
row after row of dusty cardboard file boxes and ledgers stacked one on top of another
norman stops in his tracks color draining from his face
courtney follows faking enthusiasm
im super psyched
this is turning into the most fun night ever
the overhead light clicks on as alvin steps into the room behind her and groans
zombies take over the world and we lock ourselves in a library
are you kidding me
theres an adult video store just across the street
neil is more optimistic and brightly makes his way over to a shelf and pulls down a slim ledger
thisll be a piece of cake youll see
he pauses and frowns squinting up his eyes as he reads aloud very slowly
okay page one
mitch hefts a particularly heavy box file off a shelf
he seems to read the filing notes written across its front then ignores them and begins curling it like a dumbbell
i really hate these places
norman sizes up the masses of documents all around them face panicked
it would take days to go through them all
no thats not it
time is running out
sheriff hooper looks around and sees an awful lot of armed people beginning to bay for blood and she sees trouble on her hands
aint room for no more zombies in this town
standing behind him teddy agrees with a slack jawed yeah
perry drives into town in silence his nose bloodied and stuffed with tissues
sandra sits beside him and sheriff hooper is in the back seat scouring the streets
wouldve been a quiet night too if it hadnt been for those meddling kids
as perry and sandra exchange uneasy glances hooper suddenly points through the windshield to the riot in progress on main street
sweet baby jinkies
perry brakes hard just a few feet in front of the advancing mob moving menacingly en masse in pursuit of the fleeing undead
hooper bustles out of the car making a beeline for deputy dwayne
crystal turns and fires into the street taking out a lightbulb over a store sign
a dog somewhere in the shadows yelps and runs away
sheriff hooper is outraged and snatches the gun out of crystals hand
what do you think youre doing firing at civilians
that is for the police to do
its okay sheriff weve only been shooting at the dead ones
its the living dead come to take us all to hell
we gotta stop them before they get away
in the alley down the side of the old town hall the zombies tiptoe through the shadows
they look slightly the worse for wear some have lost limbs others have large holes in them
one has a toilet plunger stuck on her head
the dead judge looks up at the sky
the turgid supernatural storm rumbles closer pressing down upon the nearby rooftops
the judge motions to the other zombies to hurry and grabs hold of the town halls side door
he rips it open and furtively motions the zombies to file inside
move along now people there isnt anything to see here
the townsfolk around her refuse to be allayed by this
perry and sandra have emerged dubiously out of their car and watch from the periphery utterly bewildered
mrs henscher newly arrived and wearing her avocado face mask like war paint shakes her shotgun and points down the street
i saw them
i saw them
the zombies are in the town hall
the information sweeps across the crowd like wildfire
several faces turn to henscher who is pleased to have an engaged audience and hams it up shamelessly coming on like braveheart in curlers
and let slip the dogs of war
the faces around her dont react waiting patiently for a clearer translation
lets rip em apart
mrs henscher points the crowd toward the town hall
despite hoopers protests the townsfolk are on lynch mob auto pilot and surge like a force of nature along the main street toward the town hall plaza
dozens of books and cardboard boxes lie scattered across the floor
the glass cabinets around the room have been ransacked as the kids drag documents off shelves and rummage through binders
norman sits on the floor flipping through sheet after sheet of records
courtney wades through documents toward him holding up a fist full of old rolled up papers
were not going to find it in here norman
this is useless
yeah i know and its also really boring
i thought i was driving the van
no one told me i was gonna have to do this other dumb stuff
if id known there was so much reading involved i would have brought a completely different group of people who hate me
neil suddenly yells out victoriously
everyone turns to him hardly believing he might have found the answer
he waves a book triumphantly above his head and grins at everyone
book number one
that is right twenty six pages oh yeah
everyone groans and turns back to their bickering
i cant believe this is your plan
im gonna get bitten and start eating peoples brains
im supposed to be vegan
mitch suddenly shouts out from the doorway
theres something moving out there
i think its the zombies
oh no its not
its just grown ups
the square outside is awash with threatening townsfolk led by mrs henscher and deputy dwayne
some charge up the town hall steps jeering and whistling
blurry silhouettes move across the outside of the window occasionally smacking against them with their fists
a brick smashes through a window and clatters across the floor between courtneys feet
the kids start to hurry toward the lobby leaving norman sitting amongst the spilled documents
yknow what that is
thats not awesome
guys come on
just give it up weiner
we have to keep trying
we tried and look what happened
im scared norman and i cant listen to this any more
norman looks at the faces in front of him
the kids are scared and confused and angry
even neil has nothing encouraging to offer
normans brow furrows
you never listen
no one ever listens
im scared too but ive still gotta do this
i do too listen
and whatever it was you just said its not working
you think youre going to go out there and do your talking to the dead thing and this is all going to be okay
what are you going to do ask the zombies not to eat you
i shouldve known you wouldnt understand
no one ever does
norman you need to stop all this weird stuff and start living in the real world
everyone in the real world thinks im a freak
and you know what maybe theyre right maybe i am a freak
but i never asked for your help
courtney mitch and alvin back off a half step as norman advances on them
jeez that was dramatic
courtney shoots him a look as if shes about to fight back then shakes her head and shoves her way through the door
she turns to go snapping at the other kids behind her
one by one the kids turn and file out but neil still insists on remaining folding his arms defiantly
im not going anywhere
you cant make me
mitch shrugs and picks his brother up scooping him under one arm and carrying him out the door
dude youre really heavy
im not speaking to you
you cant make me
norman watches the doors shut behind them and his anger begins to ebb
alone in the archive room he slumps to his knees feeling useless and frustrated
in the lobby no one can hear him over the sounds of the mob
the kids have nervously approached the barricade at the front door hoping to appeal to the figures outside
um excuse me
unmistakably living hands and arms suddenly smash through the barricade clawing into the town hall
the kids recoil from the windows screaming as they bat ineffectually at the grasping hands
slob guy reaches in through a gap in the broken woodwork managing to grab a hold of something
theyre in there alright
i can feel its clammy flesh
neil screams as slob guy gropes at his chubby arm
norman notices his backpack on the floor in front of him the book of fairy tales poking out
he picks it up and runs his hand absently over the embossed leather cover
something clatters behind him and norman hears someone approaching
he turns around to face his friend and finds himself staring up at a zombie moving toward him along the dark aisle pale moonlight shining off its exposed bones
he realizes zombies are converging on him from all directions barring his way out through the door
the dead judge groans as he approaches
norman backs away clutching the book to his chest
out of the corner of his eye norman spots another doorway in the shadows of the wall behind him and moves toward it calling out desperately
somebody help me
norman runs up a tight stairwell leading to the roof of the building the zombies just a few steps beneath him
lets burn em out
obligingly a couple of townsfolk hurl molotov cocktails at the windows
the kids manage to pull back just as a burning bottle flies over their heads shattering glass
it lands in the middle of the room and a puddle of burning alcohol spreads across the floorboards
tendrils of black smoke are also beginning to creep under the edge of the front door
the kids stand in a group terror stricken as the smoke thickens and flames begin to lick along the floor
courtney is quick to lose what remains of her composure
were all gonna die
norman heaves himself through a tiny hatchway onto a flat roof at the highest point of the building
he shuts the hatch inching away as the zombies beneath beat on it with their hands
norman finds himself backed up against a flimsy wooden rail which creaks warningly
he leans over and sees the square beneath filled with angry people
he has nowhere left to run
above him the red sky rumbles clouds churning into a ghastly grinning mouth
far below the gathered townsfolk grow increasingly erratic
a pair of visiting tourists happily take in their surroundings with their cell phones and cameras
sandra tugs at her husbands arm as they are buffeted by the increasingly erratic townsfolk
oh my gosh do you think this has got anything to do with norman
perry waves her hand away irritably
of course not
he is interrupted by a shout as someone sees normans tiny figure silhouetted against the raging sky on the roof of the building
perry and sandra see their son begin gesticulating wildly at the clouds
perry do something
he cups his hands around his mouth and yells at norman
get down from there this instant
youre supposed to be grounded
distraught norman bellows into the sky waving the book angrily above his head
you horrible old witch
is this what you want
the roiling face above him seems to cackle mercilessly
the mob begins to lurch to all new stupid conclusions as norman waves his arms at the clouds
this is all his doing
perry feels the shift in the crowd
theyre not just baying for blood
theyre about to start baying for his sons blood
norman continues yelling at the sky waving the book
he madly flicks through the pages attempting to read aloud over the roaring wind
once upon a time in a far off land there lived a king and queen
in a magnificent castle
the horrible cloud face above him cackles monstrously drowning out the story
why wont you listen to me
why are you doing this
the face in the clouds turns inside out as a tongue of lightning spits out
it smacks into the book held in front of normans chest lifts him up off his feet and throws him back onto the old timbers of the roof
the air is knocked out of norman as trailing smoke he smashes through the wood into the fiery chasm of the building beneath
camera follows him as he plummets screaming and is enveloped in thick black smoke
there is a loud thud and silence
norman lies on the floor shifting painfully
with some effort he sits up rubbing his head
the book in his hand is now a blackened cinder with a large smoldering hole gouged through the middle
norman realizes he is no longer inside the burning building
around him indistinct shapes begin to pool into clarity
he is in the courthouse but three hundred years ago and a trial is about to begin
a crowd of onlookers gather around a platform at the head of the room where officious looking gentlemen in austere puritan clothing stand around a table
two dour men in black skull caps are seated an empty chair between them
norman moves unnoticed through the crowd toward the platform
the hubbub of the townsfolk dies down
the imposing figure of judge hopkins tall and august marches out of a side chamber steps up onto the wooden dais and seats himself silently between his solemn peers
he glares down at norman with cold humorless eyes
agatha prenderghast of his majestys province of massachusetts
as the judges voice continues norman sees played out against it a montage of the preceding court case
the notary stands up waving a wad of testimonies
on this day you have been arraigned for the horrible crime of witchcraft
a pale woman fiddles nervously with the ribbon on her bonnet as she is questioned by the judge
witnessed by those whose testimonies have been heard
a wiry woman with a pinched face gestures fearfully with her arms as she recounts her evidence
you have by this court been found guilty
a young farmhand bows his head shamefully as he adds further ammunition to the prosecution
and it is passed on you according to your grievous crimes
another village woman sobs into a handkerchief as she tells her story
quick cuts of the accusers one after the other as the judge finishes his verdict
the notary the preacher the townsfolk
all point at norman
camera swings slowly around norman to reveal aggie prenderghast standing in chains right behind him
norman reacts with horror
the witch cowering next to him is no more than eleven years old
her long hair is unkempt and dirt on her face is streaked with tears from her eyes
her manacles have been specially made to fit her tiny wrists and weigh her to the floor
she sniffs scared and confused
do you have anything to say for yourself
i was only playing
aye with fire
you were speaking with the dead
the crowd gasps and murmurs fearfully
ill not risk damnation on these good people
the town sheriff grabs aggie by the shoulder
you are to be taken to the place of execution where you will be hanged by the neck until you be dead
norman shouts out but no one can hear or see him
you cant do this
the grim faced sheriff moves toward norman and aggie
she backs away tears flowing down her face
i didnt do anything wrong
a terrible panic comes over her face
leave me alone or ill make you sorry
ill make all of you sorry
norman feels unsteady on his feet the room seeming to spin around him
the faces of the townsfolk pale and skull like swirl around and around blurring together
in the center of it all glowing like a bonfire aggie the world turns black and norman collapses in a faint
the high timbers of the hall roof swim into focus and then faces peering down at him
skeletal rotting faces
the dead puritans are standing around him in a half circle
he sits up terrified and looks around shuffling back across the floorboards on his bottom
the dead villagers stand where they are staring intently
norman sits a moment heart pounding whispering shakily
how could you
she was just a little kid
she was no different than me
the dead judge takes a step forward
keep away from me
the dead judge stops then opens his horrible mouth and speaks in a guttural voice
norman is stunned
you dont want to kill me
the judge shakes his head and points down at the book beside normans feet
you can speak to the dead
we need you to read from the book to send us all back to the grave
but it didnt work
its a fairy tale
just a bedtime
he narrows his eyes at the judge
thats it isnt it
a bedtime story to keep a little girl asleep for another year
and now you need my help because im the only one who can read it to her
he bends down to pick it up
his eyes flash angrily at the zombies and he hurls the burnt book at the judge
it hits him in the chest and falls to his feet with a thud
heres your book
try reading it yourself
the zombies stare down at the blackened lump of charred paper and several of them gasp
the dead judges eyes are filled with fear and desperation
why did you do it
we were scared
i believed we were doing what was right
i was wrong
now this is our punishment
we thought we knew our way in life but in death we are lost
norman knows theyre telling the truth
please help us
norman looks at the book of fairy tales lying at his feet
its pages are curled and blackened embers still glowing around the hole blown right through it
every year someone reads the story at her grave
before me it was mr prenderghast and before him there were others but the curse doesnt ever go away
nothing gets better
its not enough
norman looks at it a moment thinking
he knows what he has to do
what will you do
something nobody ever did before
ive gotta go talk to her
smeared with soot and coughing the kids are trapped in the lobby
they cower together as burning wood creaks and cracks all around them
the air is grey and caustic and filled with flakes of charcoal and burning ash
a burning timber groans as it splits from the ceiling and tumbles toward the children
they scream and scatter as it hits the floorboards in a shower of glowing sparks
mitch shouts out from beside a heavy wooden counter top
the kids scramble beneath the shelter of the counter as more glowing embers rain down around them
courtney grabs mitch by the bicep and whispers weakly
mitch if we die tonight this might be the last chance i get to tell you how i feel
uh well no
unless we get brought back as zombies and then technically youll have longer
courtney opens her mouth to continue but her love train is thoroughly derailed by the nearby crash of breaking wood and the archive door beside them clatters to the ground
the cowering kids all watch in silent horror as several dark figures limp and shamble out of the smoke and make their way past them across the room
its the zombies and theyre being led by norman
youve gotta be kidding me
norman his mouth shielded by his sleeve heads purposefully toward the front doors
a loud thud from within the town hall causes the gathered crowd outside to gasp and those closest to the doors to take a few steps back
the crowd gasps again as the charred front door of the town hall is wrenched off its hinges by a huge piece of timber and crashes down the steps in
a shower of flaming splinters
a ripple of shock runs through the crowd as a number of skeletal figures emerge spluttering and wheezing through the smoke shielding their faces from the heat
the gathered crowd are even more aghast when they realize a child is being guided out of the flames by the zombies
unseen by the crowd courtney and the other kids crawl to the splintered opening of the front door blinking and coughing for air
hooper pulls out her gun and marches toward the zombies
you stay right where you are
you may be dead already but i will still shoot you
the zombies stop on the steps burning building behind them and the hostile townsfolk in front of them
norman pushes through and stands firmly in the way of hoopers gun arms spread defensively
courtney and the other kids gasp as they watch from within the doorway
oh my gosh
far above the clouds thunder like demonic laughter
perry steps forward face red
step away from the zombies
sandra comes up behind her husband and holds his arm
perry calm down
youre going to have a heart attack and then what are you going to do
ill come back and haunt norman
maybe then hell start listening to me
you dont understand whats happening here
i spoke to them and its not what you think
courtney edges forward out of the doorway shocked but transfixed
the curse isnt about the zombies hurting you
its about you hurting them
i figured it out and i know a way to stop this
hes in league with them
a few members of the crowd try to push past perry toward the steps
lets hang him
we cant hang him stupid
its the st century
then lets burn him
sandra turns despairingly to the crowd behind her
can you stop being a mob for just one minute
listen to me
get them before they eat us
punctuating every shout the roiling clouds continue to rumble their horrible laughter
leave him alone
courtney suddenly emerges standing right in front of norman
following her lead in true im spartacus
fashion neil mitch and alvin step forward too creating a barrier all around him all joining hands in solidarity
close on courtneys face as she hisses sidelong to alvin
a ripple of confusion seems to run through the crowd
everybody listen up
you all need to stop trying to kill my brother
i know that this seems crazy believe me im with you on that but i think he does actually know what hes talking about
all night hes been trying to save you from the witchs curse
yeah and all you want to do is burn and murder stuff burn and murder stuff
just burning and murdering
shame on every single one of you
how dare you all
amongst the crowd doubt is beginning to show
even the rumbling clouds have gone quiet
so theyre not going to hurt us
no does it look like any of them are trying to hurt you
theyre just people
at least they used to be
just stupid people who should have known better
norman looks at the line of puritans
they look quite sad and pathetic really
hardly monstrous at all
they did something unforgivable because they were scared and they were cursed for it
now its happening all over again
dont you get it
they were just like you
but now it has to stop
across the crowd weapons are being lowered and faces are starting to look a little guilty
there is silence as the modern townsfolk stare at the line of three hundred year old townsfolk
throughout the crowd various weapons clatter as they hit the ground
a small girl tiptoes up the steps and silently offers one of the zombies his arm back
the quiet is shattered by a deafening scream
it blows out of the storm clouds and whips through the plaza on a hellish wind
the street lamps around the square shatter in bursts of sparks raining down on the amassed people
the sky above is blood red clouds twisting and contorting into a vast unnatural vortex
the town hall erupts in a fireball tongues of white fire roaring out of the embers as the ground shakes and the crowd scatters in terror
neil turns to norman as they duck for cover behind a parked car and shouts over the noise of the wind
jeez what is her problem
norman takes in the chaos around them
an arc of white lightning hits the base of the witchs statue with a crack
with a terrible groan the statue is lifted up into the air by the supernatural wind
it crashes down at the foot of the town hall steps shattering into a hundred pieces of rubble
windows blow out of tacky tourist stores their cheap front displays ripped apart by the wind
a bolt of lightning tears through the huge billboard in the plaza ripping apart the idealized image of the towns history in a spiral of splintered wood
norman struggles over to where a group of townsfolk and zombies cower from the destruction
sandra runs over to her son and hugs him
so what do we do now
i really dont know
yes you do norman
youve got to get to that witchs grave
you listen to me buster we didnt turn away when daleridge high was slaughtering our volleyball team did we
i thought we did
no we didnt
ive cheered the uncheerable norman and im not letting you give up now
norman turns to perry his eyes all business
dad could i borrow the car
norman looks squarely at his dad and the dead judge beside him
they exchange uneasy glances
the dead judge sits rigidly between norman and courtney in the back of perrys station wagon perry and sandra in the front
perry drives in silent discomfort following the judges instructions through town glancing in his rear view mirror at the passengers in the back seat
sandra takes a small perfume spritzer from her purse as surreptitiously as she can and sprays the air around her
the car turns a corner into the path of an overturned truck caught by the spectral wind
it cartwheels down the middle of the street tearing up the asphalt
perry swerves out of its path of destruction
inside sandra cranes her neck around to watch the truck crash down the road behind them
she faces front again
boy the traffic tonight
hes on my side of the seat
she wants you to move over
the judge mumbles
i heard that
tell the zombie to stop saying stuff about me
can you quit using the z word
so help me i will stop this car right now if all three of you dont quit it this instant
after a moment the judge lets out a sepulchral moan
he says take a left here
perry gives a distasteful look but turns the steering wheel
he peers out through the raging storm windscreen wiper batting ineffectively at the onslaught of debris
weve already been this way
were going around in circles
maybe we should pull over and ask someone
oh right you think maybe we should stop at a graveyard and dig up some other eighteenth century corpses
its not a bad idea
i wish i understood you
from the back seat the judge turns to norman and groans
please dont tell me he needs to use the bathroom
norman listens as the judge continues grumbling then leans forward over his fathers seat pointing
turn down there
the car turns tightly off a secluded road onto a dirt path running into the thick of the surrounding woodland
oh my do you think thats it
the headlights of the car illuminate a huge fallen trunk ahead along the path and perry pulls the car to a stop wheels crunching on dirt and roots
everyone gets out of the car
the trees around them are thick and dense
aggies furious storm whistles through the branches far above them
norman turns to the dead judge
the judge nods solemnly pointing ahead
norman steels himself and begins to march forward through the thick brambles the others following behind
so why are we here
someones gotta talk to her dad
yeah um whys that person you exactly
as they continue the surrounding trees press in on them just like in normans vision
branches and thorns lash at their faces while thick roots entangle their feet
normans family are falling behind and realize too late that the encroaching trees are about to crush norman
oh my goodness look out
perry is finding it difficult to move a tree bears down on him its roots snagging his thrashing limbs
kick it in the knothole
norman hops nimbly between two huge trunks as they smash together blocking off the way ahead with gnarled wood
sandra struggles free and shouts over the branches
im okay mom
wait for me here
now separated from the others norman turns to go ahead on his own
ahead of him a phosphorescent glow shines off the trees and he knows he is very close
exhausted but determined norman finds the source of the supernatural storm a clearing sculpted out of the forest by aggies fury
in the center of it all is the tree bleached white as bone and grotesquely twisted
the trees around it creak and groan as though theyd like to uproot and plant themselves someplace else
beneath this tree lie aggies remains buried three hundred years ago
now a mess of roots and rocks open out like an ugly wound and within them a tiny childlike figure is barely visible through a spitting furnace of spectral energy
ectoplasm rages up around the trees finger like branches like a mushroom cloud of negative energy
its a childs tantrum turned atomic
words echo around him in response
youre not welcome here
norman shivers as the voice rumbles coldly
the raging wind intensifies as norman turns back around
i really need to speak with you
who are you
you dont actually know me but i know you
were actually kind of the same you and i
norman takes another step closer ducking as petrified branches and rocks fly over his head on the wind
youre not dead
well no apart from that
and youre a boy
well yes that too
youre not like me at all
norman hesitates knowing hes on dangerous ground
well i know how you feel
no you dont
you dont know anything about me
i know your name is agatha prenderghast
the ghostly voice wavers for the first time
and i know youre probably tired
because i mean its really late and its been a long night and were like only eleven years old and
the voice snaps back like a clap of thunder
i dont want to go to sleep and you cant make me
i burnt the book into dust and now i dont have to listen to that stupid story any more
leave me alone
norman is terrified but advances on the tree the rocks under his feet churning
im not leaving
just listen to me
takes a breath uh
once upon a time
there was a little girl
a little girl who was different from the other people in her village
the voice chants petulantly over him as if putting its demonic fingers in its ears
im not listening
la la la la la she could see and do things that no one could understand and that made them scared of her
i dont like this story
she turned away from everyone and became sad and lonely and had no one to turn to
if aggie werent floating three feet above the ground shed be stamping her feet
her voice blows bits of bark off the surrounding trees
but the more she turned away from people the more scared they were of her and they did something terrible
arcs of white energy crackle through the air
where they hit the ground they send up white flames
they became so scared that they took her away and killed her
but even though she was dead something in her came back
and this part of her wouldnt go away not for three hundred years
and the longer it stayed the less there was of the little girl
ill make you suffer
aggie goes to shout but stops unsure of her answer
because you want everyone to hurt just as much as you are
so whenever you wake up you play this mean game but you dont play fair
they hurt me
so you hurt them back
i wanted everyone to see how rotten they were
youre just like them agatha
no im not
youre a bully
no im not
norman has almost reached the eye of the storm
the world behind him is a whirling torrent of burning white chaos
they did something awful but that doesnt mean you should too
all thats left of you now is mean and horrible
he sees her clearly now
true she is floating above the ground and her hair is writhing madly about her and plumes of spectral fire are pouring off her body but shes still just a
little girl underneath
thats not true
norman climbs up a tree root aggies flames searing his skin and clothes as he gets close enough to touch her
this is wrong and you know it
youve spent so long remembering the bad people that youve forgotten the good ones
there must have been someone who loved you and cared for you
you dont remember them
leave me alone
but youre not alone
you have to remember
keep away from me
norman reaches the end of the root and jumps
his outstretched fingers shake madly as they approach aggies tiny hand as though the air is fighting against him
there is a flash of white and silence
dappled sunlight falls through shimmering leaves and blossoms
norman and aggie are standing in thick grass replete with wild flowers the dead white tree now quite alive and blossoming behind them
aggie is no longer an indistinct specter but flesh and blood and as real as norman
she stares down at her hand as norman holds it gently by the end of her finger
my name was aggie
a brightly colored butterfly flutters between them
aggie starts to remember as she follows its flight
i remember my mommy brought me here once
we sat under the tree and she told me stories
they all had happy endings
and then those horrible men came and took me away and i never saw her again
she scowls angrily at the butterfly flitting past her face
it instantly crumples up into ashes
surprised she gasps and watches the blackened dust fall to the ground
theres anger in aggie but there is confusion sadness and regret there too
she isnt quite so scary anymore
sometimes when people get scared they say and do terrible things
i think you got so scared that you forgot who you are
but i dont think youre a witch
aggie looks into his eyes
i think youre just a little kid with a really special gift who only ever wanted people to understand her
he smiles softly
so were not all that different at all
but what about the people who hurt you
dont you ever want to make them suffer
norman thinks this over and shrugs
well yeah but what good would that do
you think just because theres bad people out there that theres no good ones either
i thought the same thing
for a while
but theres always someone out there for you
aggie frowns looking lost
i just want my mommy
im sorry aggie
that story you were telling
how does it end
i think thats up to you
aggie blinks through tears at the grass beneath her feet
is this where they buried me
its a pretty good place to sleep
then you can be with your mom again
aggie holds normans gaze then looks down to the ground her tiny frame heaving with a last sob
she sits down on the grass and curls up resting her head on her hands
norman kneels down next to her as she closes her eyes
her breathing grows deeper and more peaceful her tiny frame shifting softly under her long hair
the air around them grows blurry and indistinct
aggie softens as though out of focus and the whole world becomes a swirling dance of glowing orbs
norman closes his eyes as a blizzard of light engulfs him spiraling up into the clouds high above his head
lightning flashes white far above and thunder rumbles softly through the sky as if moving away
the zombies form a group in the center of the square all of them looking up into the clouds
the people around them stop and stare awestruck as a breeze buffets their clothes and the air around them begins to shimmer
as the modern townsfolk watch on some of the zombies take each others arms for support
those with eyelids close them
one by one their bodies dissolve away leaving ethereal figures in their place
for a moment they float where they stood ghostly apparitions of the people they once were before the curse
they stare sadly out at their flesh and blood descendents and in an instant become just specks of light that are caught by the breeze and carried out of sight
norman blinks open his eyes taking a moment to survey the scene around him
he sits upon the upturned root of the tree the earth around broken and twisted a testament to what has happened
he looks up into the sky and gives a sad smile
he clambers down through the roots back toward the path
norman wearily walks through the splintered roots to find his family
sandra shouts out when she sees him
sandra runs over to him and scoops him up in her arms hugging him tightly
my brave little man
i thought i was going to lose you
mom youre embarrassing me
thats my job
good job norman
perry takes a deep breath and looks at his son
there is relief and a hint of admiration in his eyes
well done son
you did it
the judge stood some way behind them lets out a groan and the babcocks turn to look at him
they watch in awe as the judge begins to turn to dust his ragged clothes and decayed body dissolving in the rain
for barely a moment a shimmering ghostly figure is left behind an image of the man that once was
the spirit blinks sorrowful eyes then becomes nothing more than a million glowing fragments dissipating on the breeze
the sky has lost its lurid pall and the clouds are now lighter and less menacing
in the town square clusters of townsfolk are trying to come to terms with the nights events
norman weaves through the crowd away from the babcocks station wagon searching for neil
he hears small snippets of conversation as he goes
dwayne waves his notebook under hoopers nose
so uh are we gonna need statements
she slaps it out of his hand
that was my finger nail
slob guy crystal and mrs henscher are convincing each other of their excuses
you know what its like
you join a mob and you say things
i was merely inhabiting the role
yeah it was the others
they pushed me into it
norman smiles as he passes alvin regaling a bunch of teenagers
yeah me and norman are in a lot of the same classes
pretty much inseparable
and we do a lot of psychic investigations together
we have a blog actually you should check it out
nearby courtney wastes no time cozying up to mitch
so i was thinking maybe we could catch a movie sometime
that sounds great kathy
yknow youre gonna love my boyfriend
hes like a total chick flick nut
courtney stares at him at a loss for words then successfully reads between the lines and turns away norman eventually finds neil sat upon the witch statues broken plinth attempting
to piece it back together pebble by pebble
he climbs up beside his friend who beams at him gleefully
you did it
you stopped the witchs curse and made the zombies go away and saved pretty much everything
i just wanted to say thanks
you stood by me
all the time
yeah of course
dont get weird or anything
so you think now everythings gonna turn back to normal
norman looks across the square
the smoldering buildings the fallen signposts the warped trees the rubble
as normal as it could be
norman sits on the floor in front of the tv
a news report shows the wrecked main street with the headline perry enters the room and norman quickly changes the channel on the tv to a noisy monster movie
whatre you watching
a scary movie
your uh your grandma here is she
norman looks around and sees his father and grandmother sitting side by side on the sofa
of course she is
perry tries his best to maintain his composure and wriggles a little in his seat
is she sitting next to me
perry hem hems and turns awkwardly to face her nose to ear
she doesnt seem to notice
perry tries to downplay his discomfort and turns back to concentrate on the movie his son is watching
sandra and courtney enter from the kitchen carrying snacks
sandra takes a seat on an armchair and courtney lies down on the floor beside her brother munching popcorn
they all settle in to watch the movie
a beat then perry and grandma speak at the same time
so whats happening now
so whats happening now
norman sits as he is facing the tv and grins
