written by henry selick based on the novel by neil gaiman a haunting lullaby plays against a black star pricked sky when something appears in the distance
a button eyed doll floats towards camera through the open window of a small sewing room where it lands in a pair of waiting hands hands that are made of
the doll which resembles a young black girl in old fashioned clothes hair fixed with ribbons and braids is placed on a sewing table
an elaborate sewing kit is opened and in flickering green light the needle hands go to work
the dolls old clothes are cut away button eyes torn off hair pulled out
the dolls stuffing is removed and then the empty cloth body is pulled inside out turning from nut brown to pale pink
sawdust is poured in the new dolls mouth facial features added blue yarn hair punched in and then a fresh pair of shiny black button eyes is selected from a

a beeping sound begins and he pauses
a tired moving van backs into frame and up the muddy driveway
a vw beetle suitcases roped to its top recklessly passes the truck and disappears around the side of the house
bobinsky shakes his fist angrily after the car and shouts mer sa vich
he marches away indignantly
one of the movers unseen in the truck speaks to his companion

angle from back yard
hiding behind shrubs we share the pov of a mysterious spy
with a click a close up lens is rotated into place to better see the movers quietly pack into the truck and drive away
a mangy black cat walks right in front of the lens and looks at us with concern
off screen a door bangs open
we follow the cat as it races up a tree and out a branch towards the back porch to investigate

the black cat hops into frame glances at the spy and follows the girl
coraline explores the drained crumbling pond
she finds an old turtle shell in the muck and holds it up
after rapping on it to make sure its empty she puts the shell into her shoulder bag
angle on caroline spy pov
we push aside dead vines from the railing of the garden bridge for a better look
coraline aims her forked stick once more then follows it up from the pond and out the back gate
a gust of wind blows dead leaves into a swirling eddy we track high up into the air
spy pov on sky now dark with gathering storm
hidden behind a natural wall of stones we tilt down to view coraline crossing frame on a steep hillside path
she steps on an old railroad tie and her foot sinks into the rotted wood stopping her
we lean out for a better view and dislodge some stones that roll down past her
we duck as she jerks her head our way
new angle non spy
unnerved coraline calls out
she throws a rock over the wall of stones hits the unseen spy causing a cry of pain
freaked out she gasps runs up the trail
new angle spy pov
we rise up to watch and the black cat hops onto the stone wall
coraline races down past an old tractor and into an orchard
wind begins to blow
new angle as we move beside coraline through the old apple trees where she nearly trips on the tongue of a harvest cart
down angle on on coraline as she backs into a circle of toadstools in front of a stump
breathing hard she looks out for her pursuer
the black cat shoots past coraline in the tall grass
she cant see him but she knows something is there
already behind her now the cat leaps onto the stump with a loud warning merowww
startled coraline yells and whips around
shes both angry and relieved when she sees its just some cat
you scared me to death you mangy thing
cat glares at her with blue opal eyes makes a low growl as she stands
im just looking for an old well
cat blinks eyes slowly
not talking huh
the wind picks up
she grasps the forks of her stick closes her eyes and tracing a figure eight above her magic dowser magic dowser show
angle on coraline from high bluff
the spy moves into frame astride some kind of motor bike
he presses a button on the handlebars and blasts a loud air horn
startled coraline spins around
up angle on spy
as lightning flashes and thunder rolls coraline sees him for the first time
with his turret lensed skull mask and skeleton gloves and black firemans coat flapping in the wind he looks like a psycho killer
freaked out he revs his motor pops a wheelie then swoops down the bluff towards her
she hollers in fear then tries to whack him with her forked stick
he snatches it from her as he passes knocking her to the ground
he side skids his bike hops off and jumps up onto the stump
looking ten feet tall from the ground thunder and lightning at a peak the spy turns his three eyed turret lens and studies her like a predatory alien
and then the thunder and lightning just fade out and this psycho killer three eyed spy pulls off his mask and coraline gasps hes just a short kid in a
shoulders hunched neck bent the spy real name wybie lovat aged examines coralines forked stick aims it around
let me guess youre from texas or utah someplace dried out and barren right
i heard about water witching before but it doesnt make sense i mean its just an ordinary branch
coraline snatches it from his gloved hands
coraline smacks wybie
and i dont like being stalked not by he crouches nervous to scratch the cat behind his ears
hes not really my cat hes kinda feral you know wild
of course i do feed him every night and sometimes hell come in my window n bring me little dead things
the cat purrs like a diesel
look im from pontiac
and if im a water witch points stick stomps foot wheres the secret well
you stomp too hard and youll fall in it
coraline reacts hops out of the springy circle
the boy scrapes at the ground revealing a circular covering made of wooden planks
he wedges a fallen branch under one side and using a rock for the fulcrum pries up the covering
supposed to be so deep if you fell to the bottom and looked up youd see a sky full of stars in the middle of the day
her frown relaxes and the black cat tilts his head noticing her change in tone
he steps off the branch and the well cover thumps in place
surprised she let you move in
jerks his head toward the pink house in distance
she owns the pink palace indicates house in distance wont rent to people with kids
what do you mean
suddenly worried uh
im not supposed to talk about it
changing the subject he lifts a gloved hand to shake
im wybie wybie lovat
short for wyborne
not my idea of course
whatd you get saddled with
i wasnt saddled with anything
confused not hearing it hmmm
its not real scientific but i heard an ordinary name like caroline her face goes as dark as the rain clouds above
can lead people to have ordinary expectations about a person calling from afar wyborne
i think i heard someone calling you wyborne
i didnt hear anything oh i definitely heard someone why were you born
a distant dinner bell clangs
under his breath nervous grandma
he holds up his hands in surrender nodding with eyes closed forcing some laughs
well great to meet a michigan water witch
he picks up his bike wheels it around then holds up his gloved hands
but id wear gloves next time
he points to her dowsing rod nods
cause that dowsing rod of yours
uh its poison oak
coraline drops the stick as he zooms away and wipes her hands on her clothes
the cat merows at her shaking his head with a pitying look then trots away after wybie
she sticks out her tongue at him
she looks down at the covering to the well
coraline finds a pebble and drops it through a small knot hole
ear at the knot hole she counts until theres a watery plop far below
fat raindrops start to fall around her
its pouring out
coraline looks out a window at the dead looking garden and places packets of seeds pumpkins squash snap dragons bleeding hearts on the sill
shes developed a reddish rash poison oak on one hand
the main floor kitchen like most things in the pink palace is barely maintained and looks worn and faded
coralines mother mel jones bangs away at her laptop on the table moving boxes stacked nearby
shes plain looking and tired and wears a neck brace
i almost fell down a well yesterday mom
not listening uh huh
i would have died
continues typing thats nice
coraline scratches the rash on her hand changes subject
so can i go out
i think its perfect weather for gardening
rain makes mud
mud makes a mess
coraline turns to her
but mom i want stuff growing when my friends come to visit
isnt that why we moved here
something like that
but then we had the accident
wasnt my fault you hit that truck
i never said it was
i cant believe it you and dad get paid to write about plants and you hate dirt
mel stops typing loses her patience
coraline i dont have time for you right now
and you still have unpacking to do
lots of unpacking
that sounds exciting
mel remembers something
mel contd oh some kid left this on the front porch
coraline walks over and is handed a newspaper wrapped package
attached note reads hey jonesy look what i found in grammas trunk
she rips open the package and finds the button eyed blue haired yellow raincoat wearing doll from the head credits its a litte coraline
to herself huh
a little me
she crumples the note both annoyed and charmed
whats his name anyway
and im way too old for dolls
but coraline takes it with her and leaves the room
charlie jones goose necked and gangly with thinning dark hair hunt and pecks at his ancient computer surrounded by boxes of gardening magazines and empty coffee cups
coraline with doll opens the squeaky door
he doesnt turn
hey dad hows the writing going
he ignores her reflection in his computer screen as he types away green letters on black
she clears her hello coraline
notices dolls reflection and
dyou know where the garden tools are
he hears rain outside
its pouring out there isnt it
humph its just raining
whatd the boss say
dont even think about going out coraline jones
then you wont need the tools
coraline groans stamps her feet
charlie just taps harder on the keys
pouting she makes the door squeak opening and shutting it till he cant take any more
he spins around
uhhh you know this house is a hundred and fifty years old
so explore it
he grabs a pen and pad holds it out
go out and
count all the doors and windows and write that down
list everything blue
just let me work
she rolls her eyes takes paper and pen and leaves
coraline with doll jumps on bump in carpet that moves with each jump
she wipes off the misted glass so she and the doll can see out then writes in her pad leaky windows
a drop of water lands on the pad smearing the ink
she adds really between and leaky windows
coraline thumps the carpet bump again and pounds up the stairs
a framed photo sits in the foreground on a beside table
it shows a younger happier coraline with her parents by the bear fountain at the detroit zoo
rack focus to bedroom door as it swings into the room with coraline hanging on it
she drops to the ground and doll and pad in hand decides to check out the bathroom
when she pulls aside the mildewed shower curtain she finds a hundred skittering silverfish bugs
disgusted she jumps into the tub and smashes as many as she can
she turns on the faucet to wash her hands only to get soaked with rusty water from the shower head
she shakes out her hair
coraline pounds down the stairs spots the carpet bump again in the hallway and jumps on it
a closet door opens a light on inside and she goes to investigate
angle over water heater on coraline
she jots down one rusty water heater in her pad
as she leaves she flicks off the light switch not noticing a note taped beside it that says do not turn off
lights flicker and then charlies computer dies
no no no no no gaaaa
coraline reacts with guilty alarm runs back to the closet and spots the do not turn off note
she flips the light switch back on and gets out of there
the room is faded and cold with bare windows looking out on rain and gray
the floor is strewn with moving boxes a few pieces of furniture charlies old nordic track
a few garden tools lean against one wall a cardboard mattress box leans against a corner wall
coraline enters counting windows and doors to note in her pad
she sets the doll on a low table beside an open moving box and smiles
the box is filled with her moms collection of snowglobes
she takes out her favorite the bear fountain at the detroit zoo and shakes it
she studies the globe and sighs with homesickness
she sets it carefully on the fireplace mantel then unwraps the rest of the snowglobes and places them beside it
over the mantel hangs a painting of a crying boy in blue a scoop of ice cream melting on his shirt his hand holding an empty cone
coraline takes up pad and pen and adds to her list muttering aloud
one boring blue boy in a painfully boring painting
four incredibly boring windows
she turns to grab the doll off the table by the snow globe box
all right little me where are you hiding
scanning the room she spots the doll looking out from behind the mattress box leaned against the corner wall
perplexed she walks over and kneels down to grab the doll when she notices something on the wall behind the box
she shoves the box aside and discovers the outline of a small door thats been wallpapered over
intensely curious she calls to the kitchen
mom typing away ignores her
where does this door go
im really really busy
coraline tries to open it but theres no handle
i think its locked
mel gets up really annoyed
she walks over to coraline looks at the outline of the door in the ratty old wallpaper
will you stop pestering me if i do this for you
coraline nods her head quickly panting like a dog
she heads back to the kitchen
mel pulls open a drawer pushes a bunch of loose brass and nickel keys aside to find a small sharp black key
holds it up
mel cuts the wallpaper around the door and sticks the key in the lock
coraline looks on giddy with anticipation the doll at her side
mel turns the key unlocks the door and pulls it open to reveal
an unbroken brick wall
coraline is totally disappointed
i dont get it
coraline scratches her wrist rash with annoyance
they must have closed this off when they divided up the house
mel gets up to leave
and why is the door so small
mel leaving room turns back and loses it
we made a deal
coraline makes annoyed sound
you didnt lock it
coraline pushes the little door shut her head lowered
wide angle on house
we hear charlie singing a song about coraline badly
oh my twitchy witchy girl charlie using oven mitt to protect his hand takes a burned up casserole dish from the oven while mom closes up her laptop
coraline sits at the table with her doll
i think you are so nice i give you bowls of porridge and i give you bowls of ice charlie sets the dish on the table
really bad note cream
coraline pushes it away disgusted
why dont you ever cook mom
coraline weve been through this before your dad cooks i clean and you stay out of the way
i swear ill go food shopping soon as we finish the catalog
indicates coralines plate try some of the chard you need a vegetable
looks more like slime to me
well its slime or bedtime fusspot now whats it going to be
coraline looks to her doll cradles its head
think theyre trying to poison me
she makes the dolls head nod yes
coraline rolls her eyes looks up to the heavens and falls back washed and dressed for bed on her pillow
still raining out
coraline puts the doll on the chair beside her then scratches at her wrist
origami dragonflies are strung between the tall thin bed posts the turtle shell she found in the garden sits up on a box her night lamp that projects stars and
moons is warming up on the bedside table
despite her efforts at decorating coralines new bedroom feels small and cold cracked and faded
coraline reaches for a framed photo that rests on a toy praying mantis by her night lamp
its her two best friends from home posing in the snow by her old schools marquee its letters rearranged to spell coraline good bye
she touches her friends faces with her fingertips
dont forget about me guys
she puts back the photo hits the light switch over her bed and looking over at the doll sighs
her breathing slows and with the doll watching her she starts to fall asleep
surreal mist swirls out her window
moons and stars slowly move across the walls
something in the room goes t t t t t t
coraline sits up awake
something chitters under her bed
she leans over her bedside head first peering underneath when a ghost pale kangaroo mouse jumps out and bounds out the door
she gives chase down the upper hall down the stairs snaps on the lower hall light sees it hop into the living room
the mouse edges out from beneath the sofa then hops frantically toward the small door behind the wallpaper
coraline runs and dives but the door is open a crack and the mouse escapes
coraline grabs the doors edge and pulls it open
instead of a brick wall there is a dark expanding tunnel with the hopping mouse heading towards a bluish light at the far end
she catches her breath pulls the door wider and crawls coraline moves forward towards the light ahead
coraline steps out through the same little door into what looks like the exact same living room she just left only something is different it feels deeper more dimensional
she looks around notices the painting over the fireplace the crying blue boy is now smiling his shirt clean and his ice cream back on his cone
from across the hall warm light comes from the kitchen and the smell of delicious food wafts towards her nose
mmmmm something smells good
coraline enters to see her mother cooking at the stove wearing an apron and rooster head oven mitts
the light and colors are much warmer and the details more perfect in this kitchen
other mother is facing away from coraline as she works
what are you doing here in the middle of the night
her mother turns from the stove to greet her and coraline is dumbstruck shes got buttons for eyes
she beams with happiness at coralines arrival
youre just in time for supper dear
youre not my mother
my mother doesnt have b b buh
coraline points to her own eye
b b b buttons
do you like them
she taps one with her nail
im your other mother silly
now go tell your other father that suppers ready
she opens the oven door and the intoxicating perfume of great cooking fills the air
coraline breathes it in suddenly very hungry
well go on
hes in his study
coraline goes down the hall and opens the study door
she sees the back of a man like her father only with more hair
instead of tapping away at his computer though hes picking notes on a baby grand piano
he turns around
he too has shiny button eyes
he seems happier and a little more handsome than real dad and wears an iridescent robe over polka dot pajamas with orange monkey slippers on his feet
he smiles broadly
want to hear my new song
my father cant play piano
no need to
this piano plays me
seuss gloves connected with rods and pulleys pop out of the pianos front and onto his hands
his hands raise up then drop down to play pounding stride piano as other father sings out
making up a song about coraline
shes a peach shes a doll shes a pal of mine
shes as cute as a button in the eyes of everyone who ever laid their eyes on cor a line
coraline is amazed as his hands fly
when she comes around exploring mom and i will never ever make it boring our eyes will be on coraline
anxious she taps his shoulder to stop him
i uh sorry but she said to tell you the foods ready
raise your hand
he sticks his hand up still in a glove and his other gloved hand slaps his face
she laughs then covers her mouth
other mother sets down a huge roasted chicken near coraline on a table spread with candles fine china and silver and a pineapple centerpiece
figure eight model train tracks circle twin lazy susans covered in dishes of potatoes sweet peas rolls and corn
the other father seals this norman rockwell moment by making prayer hands and a solemn face
we give our thanks and ask to bless our mothers golden chicken breast
he laughs with glee then a starting bell rings and its time to eat
other father really digs in while coraline tries some chicken
mmmm this chicken is good
hungry arent you
nodding mouth full dyou have any gravy
well here comes the gravy train
other mother giggles as a model train circles round the track pulling a gravy boat car and blowing its whistle
the train goes in one side of the centerpiece and comes out the other slowing till the gravy boat lines up with coralines plate where it pours gravy on her
another roll sweet peas
corn on the cob
other mother looks on approvingly not touching any food herself
mouth full im real thirsty
a beautiful chandelier drink dispenser descends
mango milk shake
the dispenser spins stops and fills her glass while other mother presents dessert a cake with candles that pop up and light themselves while the words welcome home
write themselves in icing
coraline is taken aback
her other parents squeeze each others hands warmly
weve been waiting for you coraline
wasnt the same here without you kiddo
coraline remains a little unsure
i didnt know i had an other mother
of course you do
she smiles at coraline her button eyes gleaming
uh huh and soon as youre through eating i thought wed play a game
she taps her fingers a little too excitedly on the table
you mean like hide and seek
hide and seek in the rain
thunder lightning then rain appears outside the window
huh what about the mud
we love mud here
other mother rises walks towards coraline
mud facials mud baths mud pies its great for poison oak
the takes coralines rashy hand but coraline pulls it away
howd you know i coraline adjusts her tone
i id love to play but
i better get home to my other mother
but im your other mother
i mean my other other mother
mom number one
i think i should get to bed
of course sweetheart its all made up
shakes head but
other father steps in beside her
come along sleepyhead
they lead her from the table towards the stairs to her bedroom
in this world coralines bedroom is a dream come true it is filled with rich color and light theres a fire in the fireplace a sheer lacy canopy over her
now beautiful bed
and her favorite toys are alive
her origami dragonflies flutter towards her
hello coraline hello hello
her blue squid greets her with a wave of its tentacle
whats shakin baby
the turtle shell shed found circles her feet on clothes pin legs making panting sounds
she laughs then hears two voices from beside her bed
hey how zit goin yuper
wheres your swampers and tuke
she jumps onto the bed grabs the photo of her best friends from home now alive in the photo
kripes a mighty how are my best trolls
i cant wait till summer
youre both comin right
were already here coraline gone to or e gine
coraline grins hugely then exhausted she yawns stretching out her arms
the other mother in the bedside chair takes her hand and applies some soothing black mud to coralines poison oak rash
oh the mud
the other mother gently tucks her in then she and the other father smile at coraline as she drifts off to sleep
see you soon
see you soon
she looks around expecting bright colors a magic dragonfly
but its just her normal room moving boxes cracks in the ceiling nothings changed
she notices the button eyed doll on the chair where she left it where the other mother was sitting
she picks it up absentmindedly goes to scratch her wrist
she stops noticing that the rash on her wrist is gone
its gone my poison oak its gone
coraline goes to the little door still ajar
she peeks behind and finds the wall of solid bricks
yes it was only a dream
she shakes her head and pushes the door shut
the kettle blows from the kitchen
mel and charlie finish their go lean breakfast twigs and mugs of instant coffee
preoccupied with their work they half listen as coraline recounts her dream her breakfast untouched
fog lies outside the windows
it was incredibly real mom
only you werent really you you were my other mother
buttons for eyes huh
indicates untouched food coraline you only dreamed you ate all that chicken
take your multi vitamin at least
you were in the dream too dad
you had wild looking pajamas and orange monkey slippers
pretend offense orange
my monkey slippers are blue
he stands put his dishes in the sink
whispers over his pssst
can you get me some of that magic mud you were talking about
she points to her rash free wrists
because i have a terrible case of writers rash
mel clears her throat interrupting
if the real charlie jones wants his pages edited hed better wrap them up asap
he crisply salutes her turns on his heel and marches out the door
mel gets up to clear the table with coraline
coraline why dont you go visit downstairs
i bet those actresses would love to hear your dream
miss spink and forcible
but you said theyre dingbats
coraline sighs gets up to go
its drizzling and a white fog has lowered over the house and grounds
coraline yellow rain poncho garden shears in hand opens the front door
stepping out onto the porch she trips on a big bundle of mail
annoyed she picks it up starts leafing through the envelopes
bo bin sky
bo bin sky
bo bin sky
smells something bad sniffs the envelopes
ohh poo eeeee
she goes down the front steps and finds a sign that reads bobinsky there with an arrow that points up long winding outside stairs
with an oh well shrug she goes up
at the top she knocks on the door a little anxious
she knocks again
i think our mail got mixed up
should i leave it outside or
the door swings open
curious coraline peeks inside its dark and cramped with something boiling on the stove and a caged chicken
suddenly a huge blue man swings down behind her and she whips around to find mr
bobinsky upside down reaching right at her face
she ducks and he reaches past her to his actual target his door knob and pulls it shut
the russian giant dressed in a sleeveless t shirt and shorts pulls a raw beet from his pants
hes not happy
famous jumping mouse circus not ready little girl
oh uh i brought this for you
she holds out his mail
bobinsky takes it smelling the stinky envelopes deeply
new cheese samples
he swings down like a spider monkey and stands beside her on the balcony
coraline backs away
very clever using this mix up to sneak my home and peek at meeshkas meeshkas
im coraline jones
and i am the amazing bobinsky
but you can call me mr
b because amazing i already know that i am
he smells his mail again makes pleased sound then seems to fall off the side of the third story porch
coraline rushes over looks down
he cartwheels in from the porch railing behind her
you see caroline the problem is my new songs go oompah oompah
but the jumping mice play only toodle toot like that
is nice but not so much amazing
so now indicates smelly mail i switch to stronger cheese and soon he opens his door crouches low and turns
he hands her a beet
here have beet
make you strong
salutes her daas vee daan ya caroline
he scuttles inside and slams the door shut
cor a line
looking at the beet she makes a disgusted sound and tosses it away then heads down the stairs
when she gets to the bottom she starts towards the back gardening shears out
to herself oompah oompah toodle toot toodle toot
she looks up
bobinsky leaps all the way to the ground landing beside her out of breath
asked me to give you message
b nods gravely
he leans down so close his moustache touches her ear and whispers his voice dead serious
they are saying do not go through leetle door
do you know such a thing
coraline is startled
the one behind the wall paper
its all bricked up
the old man shrugs straightens
so sorry is nothing
sometimes the mice are leetle
he points to his head and rotates his finger
mixed up hmmm
they even get your name wrong you know
they call you coraline instead of caroline not caroline at all
he starts back up the stairs
maybe i work them too hard
coraline stares after him
shears in hand coraline approaches the family vw where one pink suitcase remains tied to the roof
she snips it free and takes out her special hat a black japanese schoolboys cap
coraline climbs down the steps to the basement flat
at the door she tries the comedy tragedy door knocker and waits
she glances down at the doormat it reads no whistling in the house
she peers through the door glass
a yapping dog suddenly leaps up inside startling her and a moment after miss spink wearing some sort of house robe opens the door and three scottie dogs hamish jock
and angus shoot out and surround coraline
spink tries to quiet them down
oh cease your infernal yapping
to coraline sweetly how nice to see you caroline
would you like to come in
were playing cards
still coraline miss spink
over shoulder miriam put the kettle on
miss spink leads coraline into the living area as miss forcible taller and sporting a platinum wig and a very large bosom prepares tea in the kitchen to the side
the dogs race ahead and jump onto the sofa
coraline scans the walls to see framed posters from the shakespeare the ladies used to perform like king leer and julius seize her
miss forcible peers out her half blind without her glasses
april i think youre being followed
its the new neighbor miriam caroline
shell be having the oolong tea
no no no no
im sure shed prefer jasmine
ah jasmine it is then
forcible grabs a handful of tea puts it in the pot and pours boiling water in
come on boys
the dogs leap off the sofa and as coraline takes their place she looks to the side and sees a towering bookcase filled with stuffed scotty dogs in knitted sweaters
with are those dogs
our sweet departed angels
couldnt bear to part with them
so we had them stuffed
now theres hamish the third the fourth the eighth the ninth
angus the second the fifth the
miss forcible arrives with a tea tray and urges coraline to take a candy as spink goes on and on
oh go on have one its hand pulled taffy from brighton best in the world
coraline reaches for a pink and green one
but the taffy is so old and sticky her fingers get stuck
then her other hand gets stuck trying to get the first hand out
seventh the third the ninth yes the fourthim right and jock junior jock senior jock the third the fourth
coraline using her feet finally un sticks the candy bowl which flies up and sticks to the ceiling
oh and thats jocks nd cousin twice removed
she turns to coraline about to sip her tea
spink indicates cup
ill read them if you like
oh your tea leaves dear
theyll tell me your future
drink up then go on
coraline gulps down the bitter brew
no not all of it not all of it
thats right now hand it over
coraline passes her the cup
spink puts a saucer on top and swirls it three times removes the saucer and peers in at the abstract leaf pattern
she purses her lips
caroline caroline caroline you are in terrible danger
miss forcible snorts
oh give me that cup april your eyes are going
youre blind as a bat
spink passes the cup to forcible who adjusts thick glasses and peers closely into it
oh now ummm
not to worry child its good news theres a tall handsome beast in your future
miriam oh really youre holding it wrong
spink forcibly rotates the cup
coraline wants more information
what do you see
the ladies heads side by side gaze into the cup
we see a spiky claw formed from the leaves
i see a very peculiar hand
forcible rotates the cup back again
upside down the claw hand looks like a giraffe
i see a giraffe
giraffes dont just fall from the sky miriam
the stuck candy dish suddenly crashes to the floor
coraline asks in a practical voice well what should i do
never wear green in your dressing room
acquire a very tall step ladder
and be very very careful
now was there something you came to tell us
coraline thinks it over then shakes her head
no i guess not
thanks for the tea though
she gets up and leaves the dogs immediately return to their sofa
the ladies resume their card game with miss spink turning to the dogs
do you have any nice queens for mummy
coraline climbs the stairs up to ground level intrigued by her fortune
to herself danger
behind her a periscope rises from the waist deep fog
coraline just catches it in her peripheral view
she frowns but doesnt let on shes aware of it
she walks ahead nonchalantly the periscope following her then suddenly turns and grabs it pulling up wybie then punches him in the arm
great the village stalker
i i wasnt stalking you
were hunting banana slugs
wybie takes some salad tongs from a tool belt snaps them
what dya mean we
theres a soft meowing from under his coat
he opens it up and the black cat emerges and climbs onto his shoulders
your cats not wild hes a wuss puss
cat glares at her angrily
he hates to get his feet wet
tired of her company the cat jumps off wybie onto a tree and up onto the roof of the house
did you make it look like me
wybie scanning under the ground fog for slugs sticks his head up for a moment
oh no i found it that way
its older than gramma old as this house probly
coraline is highly skeptical
wybie returns to his hunt
points to self cmom blue hair my swampers and raincoat
wybie stands excitedly and presents a huge yellow green slug to coraline
dang check out slugzilla
shes not impressed
youre just like them
he looks from the slug to himself
i meant my parents they dont listen to me either
wybie nods not listening again takes his camera uh huh
hands it to her
she acts put out but frames a shot
he signals hes ready and she fires off one auto flash shot after another as he strikes silly poses making sound effects horrified of the slug one moment ready to
eat it the next pretending its something from his nose in another
she cant help but giggle
finished wybie tosses the slug back into the fog and takes the camera back
he lowers his head thoughtful then glances up past coraline at the house
he sighs and speaks in a sad tone
you know ive never been inside the pink palace
grandma would kill me
thinks its dangerous or something
she had a twin sister
when they were kids grandmas sister disappeared
she says she was stolen
angle from roof over cats shoulder as dialog continues
cat senses something and turns its coralines doll at the window looking like its spying on things
well what do you think
uhhh i i dont know
back to kids
wybie astride his electric bike now whistles and the black cat jumps down from the roof onto his shoulders
maybe she just ran away
we hear wybies agitated grandmother call out
wybie turns away hes said too much
look i gotta go
he starts to pull away
wait a minute
and hes gone
push in on her pensive face
cu on doll face back in the chair by the bed
coraline takes some yellow cheese from her pocket and puts it by the door mice bait
she lies down and her breathing slows the doll watching her with a nearly imperceptible smile on its face
coraline sleeping lighting suggests another dream
some things go t t t t t t
coraline sits up looks to her door and spots a couple of kangaroo mice stealing the last bit of cheese
she gives chase after the mice hopping down the stairs with the cheese
coraline follows the kangaroo mice directly to the little door opened a crack where they disappear
she pulls it open
bricks are gone tunnel revealed
she doesnt hesitate this time to crawl through the door
coraline enters other kitchen to find other mother preparing a delicious breakfast
she looks prettier tonight her black hair shining lips redder
she stops humming a lullaby to greet coraline
welcome back darling
she is grating yellow cheese into scrambled eggs
so thoughtful of you to send this nice cheddar coraline
oh the mice bait
would you go fetch your father
beams at coraline
bet hes hungry as a pumpkin by now
you mean my other father
your better father dear
hes out in the garden
but my parents dont have time to garden
other mother shushes her and pops a strawberry in her mouth
coraline shrugs okay starts for the door
looking out she sees the broken down garden from the real world still grey and lifeless in the dim light
coraline opens the gate to the garden
a large crescent moon rises and things start to grow
two dead shrubs start to rise then blossom then the blossoms themselves are lit up by some gold and amber the hummingbirds circle around coraline light her dragonfly barrette then
continue on lighting up pitcher plants that have grown up in a nearby flower bed
a beautiful frog pokes out of one blossom
the birds lead coraline up steps past a stone wall where she spots the other father riding a praying mantis tractor on the hillside planting seeds that instantly grow into
i love your garden
he waves back calling our garden coraline
a gang of snap dragons goes at her tickling coraline till she falls down
her squeals of delight grow into oh ah stop
stop tickling ah
the other father hears this and looks over
oops daughter in distress
he guns the tractor full speed over a little bridge grabbing a gourd trumpet from a vine and blowing it
jack o lanterns surface in the pond below and spout arriving beside coraline he waggles his finger at the naughty snapdragons
tickle no more you dragon snappers
then he deftly cuts a bouquet of them and presents it to coraline
she nods thanks
well she says its time for dinner
hop on kiddo i want to show you something
the other father grabs the gearshift knob pulls it and the mechanical mantis sprouts wings
they rise in the air
looking down she sees that the garden is a portrait of coraline
i cant believe you did this
mother said youd like it
boy she knows you like the back of her hand
he pulls a lever and they zoom out of frame
coraline doesnt hold back this time
she stacks sausages on eggs on top of waffles rolls it up and stuffs it in her mouth
the other mother feeds bits of sausage to the hungry snapdragons bouquet now in a vase
i love dinner breakfast food
bobinsky has invited you to come see the jumping mice perform after dinner
that know it all wybie said it was all in mr
bs head i knew he was wrong
well everythings right in this world kiddo
coraline hurries to shovel in the rest of her meal while her other parents smile at one another
your father and i will clean up while you and your friend head upstairs
theres a knock at the door
other mother opens it to reveal the other wybie
hes cleaner with better posture and cute button eyes
hello why were you born
the boy nods button eyes shining
he just makes a shy smile doesnt answer
i thought youd like him more if he spoke a little less
shrugs smiling so i fixed him
so he cant talk at all
she looks other wybie over appreciatively
hmm i like it
now run along you two and have fun
coraline heads out the door with the mute boy
the other house lit by amber spotlights looks magical with ornate gingerbread trim glowing topiary in the yard
the kids come out the front door
youre awful cheerful considering you cant say anything
other wybie nods in agreement
coraline and he start up the stairs to bobinskys
it didnt hurt did it when she
she points to her mouth
theres an awkward moment and then he points past her excitedly a small blimp is flying towards bobinskys door
they run up the stairs and watch it slip through an opening above his door
coraline knocks and the door suddenly spins throwing them inside
they somersault to a stop and sit up
down two rows of small cannons that face each an amazing miniature circus has been set up with a ferris wheel beside it
coraline goes right to the ferris wheel where a mechanical chicken eats dried corn on the cob fires up its belly then poops out popcorn into paper bags
other wybie stomps a firing button and cotton candy shoots out of a cannon
he catches the cone then starts firing off all the cannons
coraline looks back to find him covered in the cotton candy
look at you
spotlights come on in the big top the entrance opens and a big voice is heard over loudspeakers
lady and gentleman
for to tickle your eyes and ears and making hearts to thump i sergei alexander bobinsky am introducing
they race to the entrance stoop down to crawl inside
my as tound ishing stu pen dulous and ah mazing jumping mouse circus
they sit between miniature grandstands and watch as the little blimp bathed in spotlights enters through a flap
it circles around rising to the top of the tent then nose dives towards the ground
it crashes in the center of the circus ring and opens like a flower from which jumping mice spring up like chinese acrobats to spell out c o r a
l i n e
the jumping mice leap to the ground in formation brandish tiny instruments and drummers start pounding
the drum major mouse parachutes down and whips out a baton
on his signal the group launch into a wild coraline grinning turns to the other wybie
its wonderful wybie
the boy smiles and nods to the beat of the bass drums as the hopping band marches in and out of ever changing formations pinwheels xs circles within circles
they hoppers begin to spiral to the center of the circus ring when the floor rises up from its center to form a six foot tower of babel the mice
hopping to the top
the drum major balances on the tippy top on a colorful circus wow
he runs the ball down and around the spiral as the mice hop off and when he hits the ground the tower drops away to reveal the other mister bobinsky
he cracks a coraline and other wybie stand and clap
other bobinsky in a ringmasters outfit with a full length cape bows graciously doffing his tall black hat
his moustache is waxed his eyes black buttons
that was great
very very thank you lady and gentleman
on cue the entire jumping mice band disappears into other mr
bs sleeves while the drum major swings up from the mans moustache and onto his head where hes quickly hidden by the tall black hat
we loved it mr
so a mazing
you are very velcome anytime you like you and also your good friend there
she happily turns to other wybie beaming with joy
bobinsky takes her hand to kiss it
other mother kisses sleeping coralines forehead sits back in the bedside chair
other father close by pulls a cotton candy cone off other wybie and munches it
coralines other parents smile warmly knowing something secret that makes them glad
coraline once again wakes in own bed in the real world the little doll left on the chair now clutched against her chest
her gaze moves from the doll to where she left the cheese by the door
this is much too confusing
coraline tries the small door in the corner wall
what the heck
squealing brakes as the jones jeep pulls up in front of northwest garden headquarters
townsfolk in shakespearean costumes stand about advertising a local festival
coraline is sharing her latest dream there were garden squash like balloon animals and snap dragons
on family coraline continues from back seat as her father and mother review their work pages
oh and upstairs i saw a real mouse circus not pretend like the crazy mans in our house
her parents preoccupied ignore her
you sure you wont come
indicates neck brace dont fret charlie theyll love the new catalog
at least theyll love my chapters
gives her an arent you funny look opens door
mel looks back at coraline
i did not call him crazy coraline
she makes the hand thumb bottle sign
charlie leans in to coraline pinches her nose
well i guess ill see you around you dizzy dreamer
coraline cuts him off embarrassed
im not five anymore
dad sighs heads up the steps to his appointment as mel and coraline drive off
presidents day sale
mel piles gray blouses a navy skirt white socks onto the arms of a clerk
sitting alone on some stairs coraline sees a pair of fancy green and orange gloves
as she tries them on a young rascal in costume with sword bounces past her down the stairs on a wheeled step stool his father in pursuit
my kingdom for a hooooooorse
theres an off screen crash then the step stool rolls back to coraline
she gets an idea
mel is checking out school blouses when coraline rolls past first one direction then the other modeling the colorful gloves
without looking up her mom tells her put them back
but mom the whole schools gonna wear boring gray clothes
no one will have these
put them back
coraline mutters my other mother would get them
maybe she should buy all your clothes
coraline scowls and stomps away to return the gloves
coraline and mel are driving home shopping bags in back
so what do you thinks in the other apartment
i dont know
not a family of jones imposters
then whyd you lock the door
shorter than previous oh i found some rat crap and
i thought youd feel
theyre jumping mice mom
and the dreams arent dangerous theyre the most fun ive had since weve moved here
your school might be fun
with those stupid uniforms
had to give it a try
they pull into their driveway
mel pulls out salsa mustard catsup stale tortillas from the fridge
how do you feel about a mustard ketchup salsa wrap for lunch
coraline carrying in the bags from outside makes a face
are you kidding me
had to go food shopping anyway
dads planning something special
coraline squinches up her nose
you wanna come along
you can pick out something you like
coraline plops down in a chair
oh like the gloves
mel reaches out and musses coralines hair
the girl pulls away
if things go well today i promise ill make it up
thats what you always say
mom rolls her eyes shaking her head and opens the door to leave
wont be long
shuts the door
but i might be
coraline pulls open the key drawer looking for the small black key
she looks around then spots it hanging on a hook above a door
she stands on a chair and snags it
coraline stoops in front of the small door and pushes the key into the keyhole and unlocks the door
she listens for her mothers car
grasping the key between thumb and forefinger she closes her eyes she pulls the door open
angle on coraline a soft breeze moves her hair
she knows before her eyes open that the bricks are gone
i knew it was real
she opens her eyes smiles and crawls forward
angle on coraline through window
camera pulls back and we find the black cat perched on the wet window sill observing coraline as she disappears into the tunnel
with a look of concern he exits frame
lunch is ready and waiting for her foot long hotdogs with relish grilled cheese sandwiches with gherkins curly fries piles of coleslaw and potato salad five flavors of soda pop
theres a note attached to a gift dearest coraline iss spink and miss forcible have invited you downstairs after lunch
i hope you like the new outfit i made you
coraline tears open the box and finds a pair of beautiful blue boots black corduroy trousers and a metallic grey she holds up the sweater to her body smiles then
puts down the clothes and digs into lunch
coraline dressed in her fancy new clothes steps onto the front porch and burps
its always nighttime in this world
a cat meeerows
coraline looks up to see a black cat on the porch roof above her
coraline raises her brows studies the animal a moment
wybies got a cat like you at home
not the quiet wybie the one that talks too much
you must be the other cat
the cat leaps down and lands on the railing by the basement stairs
he shakes his head and speaks
im not the other anything
he tips his head to one side opal blue eyes glinting
coraline is surprised
i can see you dont have button eyes
but if youre the same cat how can you talk
the cat shrugs from the tip of his tail to his whiskers
i just can
he leaps smoothly from the railing and onto a large cats dont talk at home
climbs up the trees upended roots head held high and proud
well youre clearly the expert on these things
after all im just a big fat wuss puss
im sorry i called you that i really am
coraline forces herself to be polite
howd you get here
ive been coming here for a while
he disappears behind one a thick root that sticks up then reappears from a large knot hole beside coraline startling her
its a game we play
indicates house hates cats and tries to keep me out
but she cant of course
he pokes his head down into the knot hole then pops it up out of another knot hole ten feet away
i come and go as i please
the other mother hates cats
not like any mother ive ever known
what do you mean
cat climbs the trees branches onto the roof
you probably think this world is a dream come true
but youre wrong
the other wybie told me so
he cant talk
the cat looks at her pitying her lack of intelligence
perhaps not to you
we cats however have far superior senses than humans and can see and smell and suddenly the cat drops into a crouch and freezes sensing something
i hear something
he scrambles across the roof and disappears around the corner
coraline shrugs skeptical and heads down to spink and forcibles their door now circled with chaser lights
she pushes past elegant velvet curtains to discover an enormous darkened theater with dim rows of seats and a high wooden stage
a flashlight comes towards her carried by a black scottie dog with button eyes
he looks up at her sniffs then leads her down the aisle past rows and rows of button eyed scotties to a front seat by the other wybie
she squeezes his arm hello he looks back warmly
light flash the audience quiets then the curtains open on a seaside setting with rotating waves
other miss spink rises up on stage left in a mermaid suit large wig button eyes and ukulele
shes practically naked
and miss spink sings
im known as the siren of all seven seas the breaker of hearts by the bay
a flat cut out ship manned by cut out men rows in behind her
so if you go swimmin with bow legged women i might steal your weak heart away
she bows her head and the audience of dogs thump their tails
spink is lowered through the stage floor the scenery changes and on the right a huge scallop shell rises up with the other miss forcible clad in the bare minimum
her homage to botticellis birth of venus
shes facing the wrong way
whisper to wybie oh my god
a dog howls alerting the near blind lady who turns to the audience and begins the next verse
a big bottomed sea witch may bob through the waves and hope to lead sailors astray but a true ocean goddess must fill out her bodice indicates her ample bosom
to present an alluring display
the dogs thump and woof wybie and coraline clap
spink furious at the greater reaction gets back in the competition
rising up she makes it clear just who shes dissing
beware of old oysters too large in the chest lets banish them from the buffet
but forcible is up to the challenge the scenery starts to change faster and faster as the ladies rise up and down competing
im far more nutritious you smell like the fishes did i hear a banshee
youre sea green with envy this mermaid enchantress no i birth of venus
the set rigging cant take it anymore ropes snap sandbags swing scenery starts to fall
will send sailors swooning oh
will send sailors swooning oh
with a crash the old ladies tumble down in a pile
the audience howls with laughter as the curtains close on the disaster
a scottie dog pushes a large bucket of water labeled pool onto center stage
spotlights tilt up to the top of very tall diving platforms where the old ladies now stand
coraline cant stand it
i cant look
ready to break a leg miriam
our lives for the theater april
they begin to bounce on the diving boards
as they bounce up the two troupers unzip fat suit disguises from which emerge their younger beautiful selves which leap to catch matching trapeze bars that swing into place
coraline laughs with relief and amazement other wybie pleased
dogs woof music begins and the two beauties eyes bright buttons sexy bathing suits striped pink and green swing out over the stage
what a piece of work is man
how noble in reason
they fly past each other on their trapezes double up catch one another hand to ankle
we notice a large pearl ring on forcibles finger
how infinite in faculty
in form and moving how express and admirable
in a sudden change of direction they swing out over the audience trapeze bar lowering and pull coraline into the air
she hollers terrified
they expertly toss her one to the other flipping and spinning as they continue their lines
her screams become cries of exhilaration
in action like an angel
in apprehension how like a god
the beauty of the world
the paragon of animals
coraline swings face to face to the dogs in the royal box seats where one licks her
the acrobats toss coraline up into the air and jack knife dive into the large bucket below
they rise up unhurt just in time to catch coraline
the three bow to thunderous thumping applause and as the camera pulls back on the scene other wybie throws her a rose
other wybie escorts coraline up the stone stairs from spink and forcibles apartment
the other mother and other father a huge full moon rising behind them wait at the top of the stairs
was it wonderful dear
other mothers hair looks absolutely beautiful and other father dapper
coraline shakes with excitement as they walk toward the front porch
other wybie holds back loses his smile
they swooped down and pulled me right out of my seat spink and forcible
only they werent old ladies that was just a disguise
but then i was flying through the air and
it was it was magic
they walk up the front steps
you do like it here dont you coraline
nods turns back uh huh
good night wybie
other father takes coraline inside
wybie at the bottom of the steps looks guilty and sad
other mother glares at him makes a huge false smile then points to him
he just lowers his head
you could stay here forever
if you want to
well sing and play games and mother will cook your favorite meals
other mother rests her hand on coralines shoulder
theres one tiny little thing we need to do
well its a surprise
coraline is seated in her place
the other mother places a small box with a bow in front of her and takes her seat along with other father
coraline excitedly removes the lid
our little doll
the surprise is a spool of black thread a silver needle and a pair of shiny black buttons for coraline gasps
she looks up at her other parents hoping its a bad joke
black is traditional but if youd prefer pink or vermillion or chartreuse
coraline sees their button eyes changing colors growing ever more panicked
though you might make me jealous
she bats the box away and her hands fly to her face cover her eyes
oh but we need a yes
if you want to stay here
other father tests the needle on his finger
so sharp you wont feel a thi oww
other mother kicks him under the table
embarrassed he puts the needle back in the box
there now its your decision darling
we only want whats best for you
she walks over and puts her hand now icy cold on coralines shoulder
coraline pushes it away and stands im
im going to bed
coraline fights to control her quaking voice
im really really tired
fakes huge yawn i just need to sleep on things
other mother stands masking disappointment
well of course you do darling
ill be happy to tuck you in
coraline backs away urging them to stay where they are
palms out forced smile oh no thanks uh you youve done so much already she turns to leave and finds the other mother blocking the doorway
other father joins her
and i smiles to other father we arent worried at all darling
soon youll see things our way
she lets go
she and the other father herd coraline across the hallway to the stairs
coraline carefully climbs the stairs the other parents watching
when they can no longer see her she races up the last steps and dashes to her other bedroom
coraline shuts the door and is quickly surrounded by fluttering dragonflies
whats wrong coraline
dont you want to play
she jumps up and catches the paper creatures opens the toy chest and tosses them in
the plush blue squid greets her from the shelf followed by the toy tank giraffe
yeah i wanna hugga your face
get a grip soldier
she grabs them both and drops them in the toy chest
her photo friends now with black buttons for eyes call out from the photo by her bed
wheres yer buttons yuper
you wanna stay dontcha
coraline grabs them as well drops them in the chest and shuts the lid
she barricades the door with a dresser and chairs and then the toy chest
im going home tonight robots and i wont be back
she sits on the bed pulls off the blue boots then climbs under the covers pulling them over her head and holding tight
she hugs herself to stop shaking knowing she must fall asleep in this bed to wake up in her real bed at home
she closes her eyes and tells herself go to sleep go to sleep go to sleep go to sleep
she tosses one way then another
we hear her voice go to sleep go to sleep
there are strange backwards sounds then the eerie voices of other mother and other father
theres just one tiny little thing we have to do
go to sleep go to sleep go to sleep
so sharp you wont feel a thing
go to sleep go to sleep go to sleep
soon youll see things our way
coraline fidgets and turns and turns again but sleep finally wraps her and takes her to oblivion
we see coralines room brightly lit like morning in the angle on coralines face beneath the covers as shes woken by the light
with a hopeful look she calls out pulls back the covers mom
her smile turns to shock theres a bright full moon in her window and its still nighttime in the other oh god im still here
coraline races downstairs to the other living room where the little door home must be
but the living room is locked tight
she pulls at the handles plants a foot and tries with all her might
its no use
she stops panting then hears a piano note being hit over and over
coraline opens the door and finds the other father sitting at the piano his back to her hitting the note
she speaks in her bravest voice
wheres the other mother
i want to go home
the other father turns around
he looks ill his hair messed and his glasses askew
he speaks his voice slowed down
all will be swell soon as mothers refreshed
her strength is our strength
the white gloved hands pop out from the piano
one covers his mouth the other wags a finger in his face
mustnt talk when mothers not here
if you wont even talk to me im gonna find the other wybie
hell help me
she turns to go
no point he pulled a long face
he pulls down the corners of his mouth impossibly far
and mother didnt like it
the piano hands pop out again aggressively shut his mouth and spin him away from coraline
frightened she runs to the door that leads outside and pulls it open
she runs out the back porch towards the other garden
she crosses the trail the other house in the distance
she runs down the path
coraline runs past trees that are lush with green leaves shes panting hard and has to slow to a fast walk
the further she goes the less tree like the fruit trees become
she hears the cat merowww
surprised she looks down
and what do you think youre doing
the cat trots along by her feet
well im gettin outta here
thats what im doing
the sky starts to brighten and the apple trees become huh
shouldnt the old well be here
the remnants of the trees and the sky and the ground give way to a pale empty nothingness
no ground or shadows
nothing out here
its the empty part of this world
she only made what she knew would impress you
why does she want me
they walk over the horizon
cat contd she wants something to love i think
something that isnt her
or maybe shed just love something to eat
thats ridiculous mothers dont eat daughters
i dont know
how do you taste
a shape rises in front of them in the whiteness and becomes the beautiful other house
coraline and the cat slow then the front yard and topiary the sky hills white gravel drive and the poplar trees behind them fill huh
but how can you walk away from something and still come back to it
the cat curls its tail into a question mark and tips its head to one side
walk around the world
the cat suddenly tenses focuses on a shrub
hang on he bounds towards the shrub and chases out a cute kangaroo mouse in uniform with a tiny trumpet
before coraline can blink hes pinned it down
stop hes one of the circus mice
with a swift blow of its paw the cat knocks the mouse into the air and catches it in his mouth
he gives a quick killing bite coraline gasps and the mouse transforms into a big dead rat
coraline is stunned
he drops the rat on the ground
i dont like rats at the best of times but this one was sounding an alarm
the cat picks the rat up and heads off
slack jawed coraline speaks with admiration
coraline looks to the house with a determined look
on the porch she takes out a heavy cane from the umbrella stand and hits it into her hand
coraline standing in front of the living room doors tests the cane in her hands and peers down the hall for danger
its dead quiet no piano no sounds of anything
she jams the cane through the doors handles and pulls with all her might
one handle and lock break and the door swings open into the pitch black living room
the hall light casts a narrow path directly to the other little door on the far wall cracked open
she steps into the room
a huge armoire bug suddenly crab steps in her path blocking the little door and all around her things start to glow
the room has been transformed into an amazing bug museum with all sorts of glowing living specimens in the place of the old furniture and furnishings
the radiators are now big caterpillars the nordic track a serving bug
the other mother speaks out startling coraline
they say even the proudest the sofa now a large bug turns in place to reveal her sitting on it
spirit can be broken
shes all smiles button eyes shining one hand held out in a behold my handiwork gesture
a bug chair scoops up coraline and brings her to the other mother
the other mother takes a candy dish from the servant bug
of course chocolate never hurts
she extends a candy dish filled living chocolate beetles
theyre cocoa beetles from zanzibar
coraline is disgusted
the other mother takes back the dish and bites off the head of one
its the first thing shes eaten in the film
i want to be with my real mom and dad
i want you to let me go
the other mother frowns swallows
she speaks with a frightening steeliness in her voice
is that any way to talk to your mother
coraline is mad and feeling mad makes her brave
you arent my mother
the other mother straightens
her button eyes now dead stare into coralines
apologize at once coraline
coraline stares right back not blinking
ill give you to the count of three
then she stands up growing taller
she grows taller still and scarier like a super model on steroids
this tall other mother grabs coraline by her nose and drags her to the hallway
ow what are you doing
she pulls coraline down the hallway to the mirror at the end
coraline flails at the tall other mother with her fists
ow that hurts
tall other mother shoves coraline right through the mirror as if it was water
coraline hits the ground hard
the tall other mother head thrust through the mirror stares down at her angrily
you may come out when youve learned to be a loving daughter
she pulls her head out and leaves coraline in darkness
coraline pounds on the mirror door kicks it with her blue boots
a sob wells up in her throat
and then we hear a soft ghostly moan
she can just make out a sagging iron bed
when the voice speaks there is a faint glow from beneath its stained cover
for the beldam might be listening
coraline steps towards the bed the faint glow from under the covers in sync with the words she hears
you mean the other mother
she gently pulls back the sheets
the dimly glowing ghosts of three children button eyes sit up a sweet girl ghost coralines size a tall girl ghost emotional a young boy ghost very sad
who are you
dont remember our names
but i member my true mommy
the boy dressed like huck finn conjures up ghost flowers
the strange looking flowers wither and fade
hes so sad that coraline takes his cold hand and squeezes it
why are you all here
the ghosts move about in a dance macabre like ghostly fish in water
she spied on our lives through the little dolls eyes and saw that we werent happy
so she lured us away with treasures and treats and games to play
gave all that we asked yet we still wanted more so we let her sew the buttons
she said that she loved us but she locked us here and ate up our lives
the ghosts fall back into their bed and sink down
coraline is stunned
she thinks a little and then speaks trying to steady her voice
well she cant keep me in the dark forever not if she wants to win my life
beating her is my only chance
then the sweet girl asks in her sing song way perhaps if you do win your escape you could find our eyes
has she taken those too
and hidden them
find our eyes mistress and our souls will be freed
the ghosts pulse with hope
coraline sits down against the mirror door bounces her head against it
shes not hopeless
suddenly hands reach through the mirror and pull her c
of coralines face eyes wild as she tears at the hands that hold her
she grabs one and flips her masked attacker onto the ground
she pulls off his mask its the other wybie his mouth stitched into a painful ear coraline sits him up
did she do this to you
she unstitches his painfully huge grin
i hope that feels bet shhh
he stops her with a finger to her lips and points to the other living room its door unlocked and open
he grabs her hand and pulls her there
its dark the bug furniture asleep
they run to the big armoire bug that guards the little door and shove it out of the way
it crashes to the floor
and from upstairs a voice calls out
is that you
she opens the little door
a cold wind blows from the dark passageway now filled with spider webs and the shoes coats and hats of other kids who tried to escape
the tunnel moves at the sound of her voice
coraline takes other wybies arm
shell hurt you again
he shakes his head no then pulls off his glove to reveal a hand made of sawdust
he blows his fingers away
high heels click from the stairs shes almost there
how dare you disobey your mother
other wybie shoves coraline into the tunnel and shuts the door
hunched down she moves as quickly as she can tearing through the sticky cobwebs
calling after her coraline
strands of web brush her face stick to her hair she closes her eyes hands out until she finally gets to the little door at the other end
she dives tucks and rolls out onto the real living room floor
coraline slams the door shut and turns the sharp little key still in the keyhole to lock it
she stands covered in dust and cobwebs and calls out with joy and relief
she goes quickly through the apartment happily calling anybody here
hello hello hello
oh moms groceries
there are bags of groceries on the table as if her mother had just gotten in
she pulls open a bag to peek and fruit flies shoot out
the food is spoiled
door bell rings
she runs excitedly to the door and flings it open
i missed you guys so much youll never but its just wybie the real boy
the wybie that talks
hes waves face down awkward
ha ha ha

coraline tenses sharp breath
my grammas real mad says it was her sisters the one that
she reads him like a book

wybie answers quickly guilty as heck
well i it looked just like you
and i coraline rushing the words tells him the truth
it used to look like this pioneer girl then huck finn junior then it was this little rascals chick with all these ribbons and braids and
her voice trails off
coraline studies wybie then snaps her fingers
grandmas missing sister
he nods one brow raising up
i think i just met her
she pulls him inside and drags him down the hall
uh listen i i im really not supposed coraline walks him to the little door in the corner wall and points
wybie looks around anxiously fearful and curious to be in his grandmothers old house
shes in there
reluctantly he bends down and reaches for the key in the lock
c can you can you unlock it
she grabs his hand stops him
not in a million years
but it wouldnt matter she cant escape without her eyes
none of the ghosts can
wybie stares at her nodding his head as if he understands her crazy story
he changes the subject gets back to his mission
so uh i really need to get that doll
coraline snaps at him
id love to get rid of it
she exhales in a huff
grabs his sleeve leads him from room
the dolls not on the bed not on the chairs or moving boxes
where are you hiding you little monster
wybie nervously watches coraline pull out her dresser drawers yank cushions off the window seat
you and gramma been talking
the dolls her spy
its how she watches you finds out whats wrong with your life
wybie trapped like a deer in the headlights tries to make sense of her remarks
is my grammas
the other mother
shes got this whole world where everythings better the food the garden the leans in on him neighbors
holds her hands up
but its all a trap
wybie eager to escape cups hand to ear by the window
uh i think i heard someone calling me jonesy
coraline sees right through him
dont believe me
you can ask the cat
he moves around her towards the door turns to leave
i ill just tell gramma that you couldnt find the doll ow
a blue boot thrown by coraline hits his arm
he turns back as she takes off the second one
youre not listening to me
he flees as the second boot flies past
coraline growls and gives chase
she grabs her boots from the floor and chases him down the stairs in her socks
door flies open and wybie runs down the front steps to his electric bike
coraline races down after him
calling over his shoulder crazy
he runs his bike towards the fallen tree hops on and pedals like mad
as coraline hurls a boot at him he guns the motor and escapes down a side path past the driveway
youre the jerk wad that gave me the doll
out of breath she turns away and notices her parents car parked to the side
excited she hops over the fallen tree and runs to the car
coraline standing in the rain excitedly looks through the cars window
but the car is empty
she spots her moms phone then opens the door to grabs it and speed dial a number
pick it up dad pick it up
whe im digging in my garden right now but leave a message and ill get right back to you
she dejectedly looks at the phone then snaps it shut
where have you gone
miss spink is knitting a sweater with wings for a worried looking angus one of the scotties who sits on her lap
coraline sips tea anxious the other two dogs beside her
dont you only make wings for the dead ones
just looking ahead dear
angus hasnt been feeling very well of late
arent you getting ready
looks off camera weve lost our ride miriam
caroline says her parents have vanished quite completely
angle on miss forcible tightening her elaborate corset behind a screen using pulleys and hooks
weve waited months for those tickets
one of the corset hooks flies up and pulls off her wig
she ignores it and comes over to address spink
i suppose we could walk
with your gamy legs
its nearly two miles to the theater
coraline clears her throat frustrated
oh oh yes
your missing parents
we know just what you need
miss forcible grabs another dish of old stuck together candy and puts it in front of coraline
how is hundred year old candy going to miss spink suddenly raises her knitting needles as if to stab coraline
coraline yelps hands up in defense
but its candies she attacks sending sticky chips flying making loud grunts as she stabs
she pulls a large three sided candy with a hole it from the rubble and passes it to coraline
there you go sweety
coraline studies the odd candy
whats it for
she holds it up looks through its hole at the ladies
well it might help
theyre good for bad things sometimes
no theyre good for lost things
they dont look any different
its bad things miriam
lost things april
coraline cant take anymore
she gets up takes the odd piece of candy and leaves
coraline dressed for bed with her blanket over her shoulder walks into her parents room the photo of her and her parents at the bear fountain in the foreground
she pulls down the bed covers and builds copies of her parents out of pillows
she fits an extra neck brace on one pillow head and some reading glasses on the other
then coraline lies down and pulls up the covers very sad
good night mom
good night dad
she kisses them both and begins to cry
cam pushes in
something blurs past camera
one paw and then two paws bat her nose
she opens her eyes to find opal blue eyes staring at her
its the black cat purring loudly
how did you get in
the cat yawns his eyes flash
do you know where mom and dad are
the cat blinks
then he heads out the door
she follows him wrapped in her blanket to the mirror at the end of the hallway
the mirror starts to glow and then an image forms within the glass
its her parents
they cling together blue with cold as snow falls
they look up and with a desperate look mel breathes on the inside mirror glass to fog it
she writes h e l p u s
her fingertip squeaking on the glass like a small sad bird
frost rises up hiding the letters and then her parents
the image fades
coraline strikes at the mirror as hard as she can
glass shatters and she drops to the ground shaking
the cat nuzzles her
how did this happen
from under the bed the cat drags out the button eyed doll remade into her mother on one side and her father on the other
shes taken them
coraline enraged throws the doll
fire light comes up on her face as the background dissolves to close on doll burning in the fireplace
coraline and cat watch until the fire burns out
she takes a breath and looks up at the mantel
angle on snowglobe the one of the fountain bears from the detroit zoo
coraline cradles it remembering
theyre not coming back are they mom and dad
not on their own
the cat blinks
she looks over at the locked little door in the corner wall
only one thing to do
series of quick shots of coraline getting ready to go
pulls her collecting bag from the closet her puffy vest her boots grabs a candle and garden shears puts them in the bag
she stands to go taking her cap off the chair
the odd piece of candy the triangle green one with the hole drops to the floor
she hesitates a moment then sticks it in her bag
we hear the click of the door being unlocked
it opens to reveal the cat and holding a lit candle coraline
she leaves the key in the lock like always takes a breath and crawls forward
the candle casts huge flickering shadows along the wall
the cat his voice returned speaks to her
you know youre walking right into her trap
i have to go back
with great feeling she explains they are my parents
challenge her then
she may not play fair but she wont refuse
shes got a thing for games
coraline thinks about it remembering
the door at the end of the tunnel clicks open the candle blows out and the cat vanishes in the dark
coraline tenses when a voice calls out
there framed in the open door back lit in blue coralines real mother with neck brace and dressed in her shopping clothes calls
coraline you came back for us
she runs forward eagerly and out the other little door throwing her arms out to hug her real mom
voice shifting why would you run away from me
coraline sees her mothers hand grow as it wraps around her
alarmed she pushes away and sees the decoy mom grow into the tall other mother
the room lights up with the glowing bug furniture and a fireplace fire
coraline tries her best to be brave
where are my parents
the tall other mothers button eyes glitter
gosh i have no idea where your old parents are
perhaps theyve grown bored of you and run away to france
her teeth gleam
they werent bored of me
you stole them
other father a foot shorter than before his sagging face a pale pumpkin color his hair vines comes up behind coraline
now dont be difficult coraline
have a seat wont you
other father gurgling happily herds coraline onto the walking bug chair
the tall other mother standing by the little door turns to it and claps her hands
a moment later a huge rat skitters out of the tunnel filled again with spider webs and childrens things carrying the key from the real world door
the tall other mother takes the key locks the door and while the armoire bug assumes guard position she why dont you have your own key
only one key
the other mother pulls a vine growing from his ear shhh
the garden squash need tending dont you think pumpkin
she turns him around her hands under his arms and drags him out
squish squash pumpkin sauce
after a beat coraline hears the very faint sound of a finger on glass just like when her mother wrote help on the mirror
coraline jumps to her feet looking around the room for a sign of her real parents
loud whisper mom dad whered she hide you
a muffled screen door slams o
and the tall other mother calls to her from the kitchen
coraline leaves frame
coraline pauses in the doorway
to herself be strong coraline
she sits at the kitchen table in her regular place her back to the sink
tall other mother humming happily prepares a mushroom omelet and bacon
fragrant cinnamon buns bake in the oven
at the tables center coraline sees the box with her button eyes with needle and thread
a bead of sweat rolls down her forehead
as casually as she can she asks anxious trying to be cool why dont we play
i know you like them
the tall other mothers button eyes flash
everybody likes games
bacon sizzles and spits on the stove
what kind of game would it be
an exploring game
a finding things game
other mother tries to act disinterested but her fingers drum with excitement
and what is it youd be finding coraline
my real parents
she folds the omelet over in the pan
and and the eyes of the ghost children
tall other mother smiles now its getting interesting
the meal ready she turns from the stove and takes the food to coraline
what if you dont find them
if i lose ill stay here with you forever and let you love me
indicates button box and ill let you sew buttons into my eyes
and if you somehow win this game
then you let me go
you let everyone go my real father and mother the dead children everyone youve trapped here
the tall other mother smiles a malicious not in a million years smile
she holds out her hand
coraline doesnt reach
not till you give me a clue
tall other mother snorts her smile sours
she slowly circles coraline and speaks as if talking to a very stupid child
in each of three wonders ive made just for you a ghosts eye is lost in plain sight
and for my parents
tall other mother standing behind her in front of the sink smiles wickedly and just starts tapping her button eye with her finger nail
coraline turns away from her
dont tell me
extending her hand coraline starts to turn back
its a deal but the tall other mother has disappeared and the tapping now is the faucet dripping in the sink
coraline exhales walks to the sink stares at the dripping faucet
what does she mean wonders
out the kitchen window the fantastic garden lights up answering her question
she furrows her brows thinks this was too easy
coraline walks through the gates
the bright magic of the garden is darker now with areas of black against areas of glowing flowers
she passes the pitcher plants and the one with the frog suddenly swallows the animal
she goes up the steps past the bleeding hearts which now leak sticky red juice that runs down the wall
at the top a few snapdragons feeble now snap at her
she kicks them down
behind her a brick tree ring opens like a monsters mouth and five huge pale snapdragons sneak towards her
they attack knock her to the ground spilling her bag
they grab coraline at her ankles knees hips waist and shoulder and start to roll her up towards the stone coraline is just able to grab her garden shears
she cuts off one mutant snapdragons head then another until she is free
the headless stems retreat into the rock mouth
coraline winded goes to gather her spilled things when a trio of hummingbirds wasp hybrids swoop in
they dont attack her instead they poke their long beaks into the triangle candy with the hole and lift off
coraline chases them but theyre getting away
as she crosses the little bridge she takes off her cap and flings it like a frisbee at them
they fall to the ground near the eyebrow shrubs sawdust spilling out
she picks up the triangle candy
why steal this
with a look of what does she have to lose she holds it up to her eye and gasps
everything is blurry grey like a pencil drawing all color gone
she scans the garden turning slowly
as she turns back to where she started she sees something right in front of her a burning red ember a ghosts that must be it
she lowers the stone from her eye to see that the ghosts eye is the faded stick shift knob from the preying mantis tractor which stands right in front of
her with the other father a squat pumpkin man at its controls his own hands imprisoned in the mechanical headlights glare and the tractor roars to life
the mechanical hands force other father to shift gears and the tractor lurches at coraline its arms slashing
she yells backs away
other father calls in a garbled voice sorrry so sorrry motherrr making meeee
coraline backs onto the little bridge that spans the fountains as the tractor moves in
dont waaaanno hurrrrrt you
the other father tries to steer the tractor away but the mechanical hands are stronger
it moves onto the bridge stupidly smashing through the planks in front of it
halfway over it lurches then starts to fall through the hole it has created
the tractor hangs precariously for a moment
other father kicks away one mechanical hand and with one hand free manages to pull off the shift knob
coraline dives forward and just gets the knob before the tractor and other father fall away and sink under the rippling out from coraline like a gray wave the entire
coraline catches her breath shaken
the ghost eye gear knob glows red no magic candy necessary
bless you miss you found me
but theres two eyes still lost
dont worry im getting the hang of it
coraline looks past the greyed garden towards the other house
a lunar eclipse has begun the full moon a pale acid green
coraline looks concerned then resolved and then she heads towards the house
a haunting version of spink and forcibles show song starts to play
coralines pov down stairway chaser lights circle the door at half speed
haunting show song continues
reverse on coraline
she carefully descends towards cam
we see her flickering shadow and then coraline appears behind the entry curtains
she steps close pulls the curtain open
pov on theater quiet and dark save for light coming through entry curtains
she spots ushers flashlight on the ground
on coraline she picks it up clicks it on and steps forward
she sweeps the light beam around apprehensive then hears something overhead
she aims flashlight up and startles a nest of bat dogs half scotties half bats
one bares his teeth and growls
she clicks off the light and shivers
on stage one spotlight and footlights fade up on a huge wrapped saltwater taffy
it hangs from ropes and sandbags
she cautiously climbs up onto the stage
a human sized taffy thing striped pale pink and green can just be seen through the wrapper
she holds her triangle candy with hole to her eye
there is a blue white glow coming from inside the wrapper
coraline punches a hole through the paper steels herself then reaches inside
she touches something sticky and cold and inhuman
clenching her teeth she grabs hold and pulls out two clasped together cold taffy hands young spink and forcibles
her heart thumps
she pries the taffy hands open like scallop shells until a large pearl on a ring is revealed
the hands suddenly grab her
young spink and forcible twisted together into one taffy monster thrust thief
give it back
coraline pulls away stretching the candy arm out across the stage
the taffy monster thrusts out another paired arm and starts dragging itself towards coraline ropes swaying on pulleys
in unison you thief
give it back
give it back
give it back
coraline desperate gets an idea
she clicks on her flashlight and aims it at the bat dogs
they growl with annoyance open their wings
the taffy monster is getting closer
coraline hurls the flashlight at the bat dogs and hits them
angered they take wing to attack her just like she planned
bat dogs are closing on the left the taffy monster on the right
she waits to the very last second and then bat dogs and taffy monster collide
coralines hand is released by the taffy hands leaving her the pearl
the bat dogs and taffy monster stuck together and still as stone turn to dead grey ash as does the stage and theater
the pearl in coralines hand pulses blue
hurry on girl her web is unwinding
coraline nods sticks the pearl in her bag and looks up towards the ceiling and beyond
coralines moving pov on lower ext stairs to up angle on balcony
we hear haunting circus music in the air
bs russian flag torn in places waves in the air
the pale green moon is nearly half eclipsed now with what is clearly the shadow of a huge dark button
angle on coraline as she climbs the last flight of stairs to bobinskys
she stops with a shudder at the top
the flag has been replaced with the empty coat of other wybie gloves pants and sneakers pinned on hanging like old laundry
she takes a breath leans out over the railing and shouts
the door behind her creaks open
coraline shivers she is definitely scared
coraline steps into the apartment and carefully shuts the door
the cannons and ferris wheel are dark and quiet the circus tent glows dimly
pale green moonlight shines in patches through holes in the roof
the corners and edges of the room are very dark
other bobinsky suddenly crawls by the door behind her
coraline whips around on guard
he looms up past the cannons on her right leaning towards her
hello ga loo boo shka
there are too many joints in his arms and legs
his tall crooked hat is pulled so low and his collar so high that his face is completely hidden
he throws out his arm towards her and the circus ball from the mouse circus rolls from his sleeve to his hand
is dis vhat youre looking for
she looks through the hole of the triangle candy and sees an amber glow the third ghosts eye
she grabs for it but hes too quick
he back bends to all fours and scuttles around her towards the back shadows
you tink vinning game is goot ting
coraline holds up the triangle candy scans the room for him
his voice sounds distorted now
youll just go home and be bored and neglected
we see him twine up a post behind coraline crawl out on a beam
same as alvays
he swings upside down from his ankles his head stopping right by coralines
she whips around alarmed
stay here vis us vee vill listen to you and laugh vis you
he drops to the floor on his head then slithers into the circus tent
coraline does not want to follow him
but she does
the other mr
b is perched on a pile of moldy cheeses in the center of the ring
he moves like all his bones are broken
if you stay here you can have vhatever you vant vsig da alvays
coraline raises the triangle candy to her eye sees the amber glow coming from inside his hat
you dont get it do you
she moves closer
i dont understand
small forms move under the back of his coat
of course you dont understand
youre just a copy she made of the real mr
last breath not even that anymore
coraline pulls off his hat
instead of his head a huge pale rat sits there holding the circus ball
it barks at her then dives down the coat collar
rats leap from coat sleeves and pant legs coraline pulls back horrified as the clothes collapse scanning around for the circus ball
theres a rat bark behind her and she turns
the huge rat balanced on a wheel of cheese circus ball in paws taunts her then runs the cheese out the door
she gives the other rats race behind the twin rows of cannons the cheese wheel rat rolls through them heading towards the door
the cannons manned by rats fire cotton candy at her
shes hit in the side her leg her ribs she weaves and stumbles the shots landing like punches
a pet door perfectly shaped for the rat on the wheel appears in the front door as the rat approaches
coraline looks up to see the pet door open and the cheese coraline takes her triangle candy stone and throws it as hard as she can at the rat
the whistling candy flies through the pet door towards the rat just outside
the rat ducks the candy misses and the cheese wheel rat escapes down the stairs with the ball
coraline lurching forward hollers
two waiting rats tail tips tied pull tails tight and trip her
she crashes through the door and
out onto the balcony which tears away from the house with attached stairway
the whole rig with coraline on top rotates as it collapses throwing coraline toward the front of the house when it hits the ground
she blacks out a moment
wheezing for breath coraline pushes up on hands and knees and scans past the topiaries and poplars and white gravel driveway looking for the cheese wheel rat and circus ball
no cheese wheel rat no circus ball ghost eye
coraline lit by a narrowing band of pale green light turns to look at the moon
its nearly covered now by the her hand stings from a scrape
blood trickles from her knee
she feels nothing but cold loss
oh god ive lost the game ive lost everything
she sobs hugs knees and face to chest
the band of light that illuminates her is narrowing to near gone
in the foreground the head of the cheese wheel rat circus ball in its teeth drops on the ground
sawdust leaks from its neck
band of light stops narrowing the eclipse paused
theres a familiar merowww and coraline looks up
across from her on the front yard sits the black cat licking his paws rats head and circus ball at his feet
i think i mentioned that i dont like rats at the best of times
coraline smiles walks towards him
i think you might have said something like that
it looked like you needed this one however
he bats the circus ball and it rolls to coraline
she picks it up sticks it in her bag
around her the thank you
looks towards house
im heading inside
i still have to find my parents
angle on moon
the stalled eclipse starts again and in one beat the last sliver of green moon is fully blacked out
the edges of the button shadow start to flake away
on coraline with cat
a strange insect thrumming has begun
what appear to be grey paint chips or bits of paper are falling
confused she looks up to see
the huge button shadow is eaten to nothing and then the sky around it is eaten as well revealing dirty white light
the destruction travels from sky to the distant hills the sound of a million invisible locusts growing louder
up angle on cat and coraline
the cat hisses
deeply alarmed they look from one direction to another
pov out front yard
the destruction travels up the driveway pulls apart the poplars and then unravels the topiary elephant and bird
down angle on coraline and cat his tail twitching
we pull back to find they are at the center of a rapidly new angle on coraline and cat as ground beneath their feet starts cracking white light coming through
cat makes a fearful sound afraid for the first time in the movie
coraline holds out her arms to the trembling animal her guardian angel
come on quickly
the cat leaps and she catches him then carries him up the disintegrating porch steps to the front door
she gets through just in time and slams it shut
its dark and stable in here with just some creaks and intermittent vibrations
a poisonous green light spills from the other living room
coraline goes there carrying the cat over her shoulder past wallpaper that peels up as she passes to the room where she last heard the sound of her mothers finger
a poisonous green fire like sleepy sea snakes burns in the fireplace
the bug furniture looks grey now their lights flickering as if short circuited legs and wings twitching uncontrollably
coraline scans the walls the ceiling looking for a sign of her parents
angle on coraline in foreground
she senses the other mother behind her a creature who is no sort of mother at all but a witch a beldam
the beldam is hunched on the sofa her face hidden
so youre back
her voice sounds dry and tired
she turns her face towards coraline
it is a white death mask cracked and peeling her true face
and you brought vermin with you
coraline shudders and steps back
the cat makes a fearful sound and digs his claws into her shoulder
i brought a friend
the beldam rises up feet tall
she is withered to the bone with plate like shoulders and hips her bustle now an arachnids tail section
her true form
she reaches her long sharp fingers made of needles to coralines face
you know i love you
coraline works hard to not show how freaked out she is
you you have a very funny way of showing it
the beldam smiles turns away then back her hand outstretched
where are they the ghost eyes
coraline pulls out the three spheres from her bag and starts to hand them over
but she catches herself
and pulls back
we arent finished yet are we
the beldam looks daggers then smiles sweetly
no i suppose not
after all you still need to find your old parents dont you
too bad you wont have this
she produces the triangle candy that coraline lost and flings it into the green fire
the beldam laughs while the magic burns out of the candy with sparks and pops
the third ghost eye pulses with amber light in her hand
coraline turns away so the witch wont see
be clever miss even if you win shell never let you go
coraline looks towards the locked little door behind the armoire bug and understands shes got to get the beldam to unlock it
she furrows her brow as an idea comes to her then nods
she turns to the witch and in the most confident tone she can muster says i already know where youve hidden them
the beldam turns from the fire both concerned and sceptical
coraline points to the little door
theyre behind that door
the beldam leans close knowing coraline is wrong and speaks very quietly
oh they are are they
a smile creeps onto her terrible face
and she starts towards the little door moving in an odd laboring way as if she had four legs instead of two
she signals the armoire bug to stand aside her back to coraline
coraline hears the soft chirp of her mothers finger on wet glass
looks around desperate where is it coming from
the cats ears twitch and focus and then he sees something on the mantel
he whispers to coraline there
and jumps to land beside the detroit zoo snow globe c
on snow globe
with a soft chirp a section of glass is wiped clear from inside by a tiny forearm and we see the tiny cold figures that are coralines trapped parents
coralines heart races
she purposely stays back from them
on beldam by little door
oblivious to coralines discovery she coughs up the key into her hand
she turns to coraline expectantly
theyll be there all right
the beldam stoops to push the key into the lock turns it leaves the key in place
she grins at coraline and speaks in a low sing song voice
youre wrong coraline
she opens the little door revealing the empty spider web tunnel
on coraline who glances from the open door to the cat obscured on the mantel and back to the beldam
shes thinking very hard
they arent there
she opens her hands one holds box with coralines black button eyes the other a threaded needle
triumphant the beldam softly gloats now youre going to stay here forever
coraline strikes a warriors pose and summons all the fury she can
she grabs the cat off the mantel and raises him over her and she hurls the cat at the beldam
the yowling animal face shocked with surprise sails through the air and lands right on the astonished witchs head
freaked out the cat digs in his claws and bites the shrieking beldam who staggers to one side of the little door
coraline grabs the snow globe with her parents inside stows it in her bag and moves out to approach the door from the other side
the beldam flails wildly at the cat
the cat howls like a banshee raises his claws and quick as you can two angle on cat as hes thrown on armoire bug
on beldam hands covering her face
her hands pull away to show empty flat sockets and torn you horrible cheating girl
she furiously stomps the floor which flies up in a spiral of floorboards that drive coraline to the rooms center
a huge web trap lies beneath the floor
the web trap stretches down into a fifty foot deep pit
there is nothing beyond but pale nothingness
the cat scrambles along the tops of falling furniture straight to the little door and disappears into the tunnel
coraline falls the very bottom of the web
fifty feet above the beldam laughs maniacally and leaps down like a huge flying spider
coraline manages to pull herself to the outside of the trap just as the beldam lands
the witch furious her prey has escaped spins around grasping blindly
where are you
you selfish brat
coraline nearing the top looks up and spots the little door still in the corner wall of the other living room
she goes to climb back inside the web when her bag gets caught on a barb
she pulls and pulls until it breaks free sending a strong vibration down the spiraling web hahahaha
the beldam smiles she knows where her prey is now
coraline makes it to the little door but the beldam is coraline scrambles through the door key in hand and grabs the doors handle
before she can shut it the coraline kicks her in the face knocking her back
the cat takes off down the tunnel
coraline nearly shuts the door when needle fingers grab hold through the crack
the door starts to pull open
the ghost childrens fluttery dismembered hands fly out from her bag and grab hold of coralines hands that grip the doors handle
and her strength is quadrupled
the door starts to shut
the beldam snatches desperately at coraline reaching through the closing gap with one thin claw
theres a final moment of resistance the beldams wire thin wrist caught in the door and then snap
the door shuts and the beldams hand drops to the ground
she screeches like a metal rake on pavement
coraline just manages to lock the door in the dark when it is pounded from the other side green light coming through cracks
she takes off down the tunnel stooped down as fast as she can
the pounding grows more insistent green light flashing
and then the tunnel behind coraline starts to grow shorter like a collapsing accordion and the pounding far door with the blind one handed beldam on the other side ahead
daylight appears and then the little door to the coraline flings herself through the doorway shuts and locks the door and braces herself against it
a split second later the other world door catches up with a crash
coraline is thrown back
but the real world door and lock hold
coraline lies on her back as beat up and tired as shes ever been gulping in breaths of air till her heart slows a little
the room is brightly lit by sunlight the first since she moved here and the sky out the windows is blue with white clouds
she smiles remembering and turns to her bag with the ghost eyes and snow globe with her parents inside
she opens it up and searches shoving aside ghost eyes and garden shears
but the snow globe is gone
she gets on all fours starts searching the floor
her hand hits a small puddle by the fireplace with tiny bits of blue snow
a drip plops down then another
she looks up to the mantel and spots the missing snow globe
she stands up and finds that its broken open and neither her parents or the fountain bears are inside
as the last of the snowy liquid drains from the globe coralines face clouds with confusion and fear what does this mean and where are her parents
then her wonderfully real mother calls to her
her true parents enter the room from the hallway a dusting of snow on their shoulders and hair
i missed you so much
coraline runs to her parents and throws her arms around them
mel notices the broken snow globe
oh no you broke my favorite snow globe
i didnt break it
it mustve broke when you escaped
mom spots her bloody knee
and cut your knee
charlie crouches low clutching his briefcase
coraline i asked you to count all the windows not put your knee through them
mel tells her
well get yourself cleaned up were going out tonight
we gotta lot to celebrate
coraline confused takes a stab
youre talking about
your garden catalog
her parents turn to leave the room
but look at the snow on your clothes
but the snow melts without a trace
whats gotten into you coraline
her parents walk off
coraline shrugs her shoulders and looks back to the broken snow globe on the mantel
she cocks her head deeply puzzled then leaves the room
the vw is parked out front its interior light fading as light in coralines bedroom window switches on
we hear charlie make a strangled sound
coraline sits in bed pajamas washed and patched wounds dressed hair shining
the key hangs from a string around her neck
a gibbous moon shines in the clear night sky
charlie wrestles with a blue stuffed toy squid like its an alien face hugger then feigning death falls on the bed
so gonna order the tulips
he opens one eye pretends hes never heard about this
for the garden party
he sits up and kids her tickling her face with the squid
i have no idea what youre talking about
she turns to mom arranging things on a shelf
dont forget the invitations
her mother nods points up
bs not drunk mom hes just
he bends down to kiss her
good night coraline
as he steps away mel slips a slim box under the covers next to her daughter
she gives coraline a told you so look and she and charlie leave the room
coraline sits up excitedly and opens the box its the green and orange gloves shed wanted
she pulls one on to admire when the black cat appears outside her window oh hello again
she walks over to the window opens it
you still mad
his expression says yes hes still mad
im really sorry i threw you at her the other mother
it was all i could think of
the cats angry expression softens
he rests his head on her hand licking her fingers and purrs
coraline exhales with relief then picks him up and carries him over to her bed
she grabs her collecting bag and takes out the large pearl the circus ball and the grey stickshift knob
she holds them out to the cat
i think its time dont you
to set them free
the cat nods
she puts the ghost eyes under her pillow and gently lays down the cat lying beside her
the two of them close their eyes and in no time at all they doze off to sleep
we slowly tilt up
a magic art sky animates subtly
cam tilt down on coraline studying sky her back to us
from behind cam chimes sound and gold light begins to shine on her
she turns toward us shielding her eyes
coralines eyes adjust to the brightness to see the three ghost children now transformed into golden angels eyes restored small fluttering wings on their backs
its a fine fine thing you did for us miss
well im glad its finally over
a shadow crosses the faces of the three children
they gather around coraline and bow their heads
it is over and done with
the tall girl ghost shifts uncomfortably then blurts youre in terrible danger girl
coraline is stunned and gestures for an explanation
i locked the door
its the key miss theres only one and the beldam will find it
the key on the string around coralines neck floats out in front of coraline
she grabs it
the three ghost children all embrace coraline tenderly
taint all bad miss
thou art alive
thou art still
they begin to swirl around her spinning faster and faster
coraline starts to turn and then she above her to find covers thrown off and the cat awake by her side
coraline lifts up her pillow and gasps the ghost eyes are in pieces like hatched bird eggs
she takes out the key on its string and explains to the cat her voice i ive gotta hide this somewhere s somewhere she can never
the cat doesnt like the sound of this
coraline grabs her blanket and heads to her door
but the cat leaps down and blocks her way
outta my way
she sidesteps the cat and leaves her room
the cat glares after her coraline trots down the stairs and purposefully heads down the hall
she passes the living room and exits frame
camera stays on living room where on the little door in the corner wall shadows and light start to move
the baseboard is pushed aside
through the narrow gap at the doors bottom the dismembered hand of the beldam crawls out
it scrambles out of frame in the direction of coraline
coraline moves briskly the house below gripping the key thats tied round her neck
dark ropey clouds reach like fingers across the gibbous moon
coraline sings her fathers nonsense song her voice hardly trembling
my twitchy witchy girl i think you are so nice
she moves down past the old fruit trees now covered with bright spring blossoms that fall gently like snow
i give you bowls of porridge and i give you bowls of ice cream
low angle on coraline moving away
the beldams hand drops into frame and creep crawls after her
i give you lots of kisses and i give you lots of hugs
coraline jams the same dead branch wybie used under the wells cover lining it up over the same fulcrum rock
but i never give you sandwiches with grease and worms and mung beans
circling around behind the big stump the hand scampers behind one rock to a bush to a tree coming closer
coraline manages to lever the wells cover off to one side leaving the whole well open
huffing and sweating she wipes her brow then takes the key string thats around her neck
the hand seeing what is about to happen races towards coraline lifts string and key not quite over her head
the hand jumps onto the big stump and springs through the air to grab the key and pull coraline to the ground
coraline makes a choked scream her fingers caught between the key string and her neck
the hand wants to drag her back to the house and the a blinding headlight hits hand and coraline an air horn sounds and wybie lovat hollering a battle cry
all his own comes speeding down the bluff on his whining electric bike
wybie guns the throttle and leaning out grabs the confused hand with his slug tongs
he circles around and heads towards the well readying to throw the hand in
but the hand gets free and grabs his handlebars
out of control wybies bike hits a rock and wybie and hand are thrown right down the well
hollering he just manages to hang on with one hand
the beldams hand caught on wybies coattail scrambles up his body and face and onto the wells edge where it stabs at his fingers to make him fall
coraline choking rises to her feet
she grabs her blanket and in the still blazing headlight of the crashed bike she runs up and throws it over the hand
it fights like crazy as coraline wrestles to control it
the hand stabs through the blanket and shakes it off
it crouches to attack her
and then wybie is back pumped with adrenaline a big rock raised over his head
he hurls it down on the leaping hand
and it breaks into twenty lifeless needles
wybie struggles to catch his breath
coraline breathing hard removes the key and string from around her sore neck
she pulls up the corners of her blanket with the needles on it around the rock and ties it all together with the string
the key is left attached
the two friends carry the heavy package to the well and drop it down the hole
by the light of a stray moonbeam they watch and listen until it makes a muffled splash in the dark water at the bottom
they slide the well cover in place
still catching his breath wybie stands holding his injured hand its glove ripped by the beldams claw
he looks over at coraline as the scene brightens a little with moonlight
i im really sorry i didnt believe you about all this
evil stuff coraline
coraline shoulders rising as she catches her breath stands and smiles he called her by real name for the first time
why did you change your mind
he walks over and takes out an old b w photo from his jacket
w well gramma showed me this picture after i called you crazy
he hands it to her
angle on photo two light skinned black girls dressed in old fashioned clothing stand in front of the pink palace before it was divided into apartments
one looks just like the sweet ghost girl and holds the doll with button eyes which looks just like her
its her and her sister before she disappeared
angle on wybie and coraline
behind them blossoms fall like snow in the orchard
the sweet ghost girl
wybies grandmother loud and worried calls from the distance
re his grandmother oh man
what am i going to tell her
she looks up from the photo and smiles
just bring her by the house tomorrow
we can tell her together
you know im glad you decided to stalk me
she gives wybie a playful punch on the arm and laughs
wasnt my idea
the black cat jumps up on the tree stump and merowws
we tilt up to the sky and see the last ropey clouds like two clawed hands clear away from the bright gibbous moon
one white balloon floats against a blue sky with puffy white clouds
we tilt down past more balloons to a table of refreshments set up by the front gates
coraline picks up a tray of drinks and heads out to her hard working guests all wearing garden gloves and showing signs of having helped plant about two hundred spink
and forcible along with their dogs are set up at a table below the steps
empty plant cartons are stacked nearby along with some garden tools and empty bags of peat moss
thanks for helping me miss spink miss forcible
straining to see oh look april pink ladies
actually its just lemonade
coraline hands them the beverages then nods towards the grey dog digging in the flowers
hows angus doing
miss spink sighs
oh much better dear
but he cant duck his wings forever
coraline heads up the steps to find her parents dumping a heavy bag of peat moss around the dead looking tree in the stone circle
here comes a burp
oh excu say moi but that pizza was delicious
charlie nods grabs them for mel and wybie
oh yeah great
you were right coraline
i really hate dirt but the tulips look nice
coraline delighted moves on
coraline comes upon bobinsky in the bottom of the drained fish pond
hes stealthily pulling just planted tulips from the dirt there and putting beets in their place
pulling beets ooo dret nican

coraline clears her throat to get his attention
how are the meeshkas mr
surprised and looking very guilty he tries to cover up his activities
she smiles and hands him a drink

and soon as dey are ready dey vish to give special tenks you performance
he drains his glass of lemonade
a familiar voice is heard approaching
coraline turns and smiles

coraline sees them and waves
the old lady looks up and smiles

background dialog of course
camera pulls up from the garden flies over the house and booms down to the pink palace apartments sign out front
on top of the sign sits the black cat who looks right into camera blinks then walks behind the thin post that holds the sign and disappears
