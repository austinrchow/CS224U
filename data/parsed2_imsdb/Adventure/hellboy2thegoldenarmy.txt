written by guillermo del toro park avenue in mid december
on the lampposts xmas lights sparkle over streets slick with slush and rain
limousines line up for a public function
under black umbrellas wealthy men and women exit the limos and enter a stately ten story building
on the facade a sign reads tonight treasures of pre christian europe
a shadowy figure lurks in an alley near the corner
his features are hidden by a broad brimmed hat
he watches as the guests present gleaming golden invitations to the security people at the door
in elvish subtitled ill go up first
youll enter from below he addresses wink an eight foot tall troll with grey skin and a huge scar over his left empty eye socket
his right hand is missing and he sports a heavy iron mace instead
a plume of breath escapes from his brutish mouth
and remember wink dont be shy
he extends his arms and with a swoop he climbs the wall up up like a bat
five floors up
camera lingers on the bloated features of a stone fertility pre celtic votive sculpture is in granite and has been dated circa b
like the guests the auctioneer is dressed in formal wear
tv monitors display the image of the statue so the bidders can have a closer look
well open the bidding at two hundred thousand dollars
a distinguished buyer raises his hand two hundred and seventy five and
we have three hundred thank you mr
van hausen three hundred thousand once a female bidder raise her hand and three hundred and fifty thousand thank you mrs
bernstein as the auction carries on a steward leaves the room and heads down a darkened corridor where other stewards wheel auction lots to and from the sales room
the steward notices an open window at the end of the corridor
he leans out and looks down
ten stories below a snow covered alley
suddenly he sees the shadowy figure above the window frame clinging to the smooth granite wall
what the h quick as lightning the shadowy figure covers the stewards mouth
when he withdraws his hand the stewards mouth has the shadowy figure grabs the hapless man by the lapels hauling him outside and dangling him over the void
far below a spiked wrought iron fence
a silent human almost as good as a dead one
he releases the steward who falls down tkkct
flailing in utter silence
all the way
onto the fence
the figure slips through the window and moves into the and now for our next item
two stewards wheel in an oaken box and open it
nestled in maroon velvet is an eight inch ornately decorated arc of gold
a once in lifetime opportunity
for the first time in auction
a piece of the royal crown of bethmoora
a precious artifact dating from the atrebatean period
exquisite workmanship in carat gold
the lights flicker briefly provoking murmurs from the audience
please please ladies and gentlemen
may i have your attention
as i was saying observe the fanciful creatures adorning the outer surface figures from a lost mythology
the lights go out completely
from the sudden darkness the shadowy figure speaks up
not at all
forgotten by you perhaps but very much alive
a few emergency lights come on revealing the shadowy figure who walks down the aisle to confront the auctioneer
sir would you please identify yourself
i see no badge or shall we just say that i am the rightful owner of this piece
he seizes the artifact
the auctioneer grabs a phone and hits a button
to a steward security call security this is an outrage an the shadowy figure reaches into his pockets and throws a handful of seeds at the auctioneers feet
outrage of krrrrr k the seeds sprout into massive thick branches and roots and instantly engulfing the auctioneer amidst coils of wooden branches crushing him
they grow and grow until they crack the ceiling
soon the auctioneer disappears and in its place stands a compact twisted tree
tiny creatures emerge from its branches and crawl around the trunk
four security guards come flying through the side doors and land in the aisles with a thud
the spectators scream
wink walks in
he carries two large iron boxes on his back
on the sides of the boxes a royal seal embossed in the metal
people cower in the corners screaming in terror and disbelief
wink shrugs the iron boxes to the floor with a clang
inside them little clawed things are scrabbling mewling fast and hungry
at the shadowy figures signal the troll opens the cages
and the peoples screams redouble
may this remind you all why you once feared the dark
a multitude of eyes glint in the darkness rows and rows of tiny teeth shine greedily
they lunge at camera
guards with german shepherds patrol the fence line
searchlights sweep the surrounding woods
super bureau for paranormal research and development a christmas tree glows next to the fireplace mozart is playing on the aquariums underwater speakers
floating in warm water on a cloud of bubbles is abe sapien lost in the music
a blurry figure approaches and raps a ring finger against the tank its tom manning chief fbi liaison to the bprd
looking dyspeptic he presses a folder against the glass hey fishstick we gotta talk
as they walk down the hall manning shows abe
look at that each photo costs a fortune to suppress
and then naturally they pop up on the net
camera moves in on abes breathing apparatus
its sleek more modern fitting snugly to his gills and neck
his goggles are new too
he examines a photo of hellboy bounding down a city street brandishing his mighty high caliber samaritan
hes looking straight at the camera lens
oh lord hes smiling in this one
i know its not just the money
its the provocation
this is asking for trouble
his ego manning leans close to a voice recognition security mike
he enunciates each syllable perfectly then turns to abe
is out of control
and i think its all deliberate on his part
he hates me
layers of steel doors trundle open in sequence
no he doesnt
hes just enthusiastic
as they approach hbs room
how are things between him and liz
oh you know
since they moved in together good days and bad
on cue the concrete wall explodes
a massive ball of fire swings the final steel door open almost tearing it off its hinges
then again there are the really bad days manning and abe cower behind a pillar
once the explosion dies away hellboys revealed lying on the floor his back smoking and in flames
oh hi blue manning he puts out a small flame on his forearm and steps into the room
yelling at liz well im not afraid of you
abe and manning peek inside hb stumbles around the rubble wreathed in smoke
he holds a bunch of blackened lps and track cassettes
yelling at liz look i have one rule
one dont touch my stuff liz appears shimmering in a halo of blue flame
hbs pulls a few lp albums out of the garbage bin
you have the same album on cd lp and an track an track
you cant listen to al green on a cd
you just cant
oh and track was the way to go one day mankind will realize its mistake
what about me
i need some space
not much but just enough to find to find my toothbrush
she flares up losing control
is that what this is about
your toothbrushs right there behind you liz turns there there with the cat food
wrinkling her nose in disgust liz plucks a toothbrush from a heap of spilled cat kibble
damn it red theres no room for me here
you cant just act like suddenly the alarm sounds
hellboy is elated
oh heavenly bells are ringing
surrounded by racks of weapons abe hellboy and liz suit up
tight lipped and grumpy liz dons black army pants and a leather jacket
she jams an automatic handgun into her utility belt
they move into a vast garage big as a stadium
it houses a fleet of planes cars boats helicopters and tanks
they load weapons and ammo on board their usual transport mobile quarters a garbage truck
the perfect gentleman hellboy holds the door open for liz
the truck interior has been refurbished with more high tech equipment
as the engine starts and the headlights blaze
the cops have surrounded the building and helicopters hover overhead
the bprd garbage truck pulls to stop
completely refurbished with a bank of monitors and a large digital world map tracking each paranormal
oh jeez did you see the crowds
he offers hb a couple of cigars and lights one for him
this is midtown manhattan
will you promise to be careful
youll use discretion
piece of cake
in and out
no one will see me
you have my word a sarcastic guffaw from liz
i can be discreet if i want to be they exit the truck and enter the building
a bprd agent agent mudd abe and liz move into the big dark sales room past a jumble of overturned chairs
they use plasma screen night vision scanners to survey the devastation
no one here
two agents lead the way down the adjacent hallway
hellboy follows a few feet behind
hb trains his flashlight on a fallen display case
broken glass glitters
same story here babe on the intercom dont call me babe i said abe im sorry wrong channel hellboy falls back to talk privately on the intercom
on the intercom yes
when we get home
im gonna clean the place up okay
even the bathroom
thats not the problem and you know it
you want to get rid of the cats
you cant mean that no
thats not the problem either then what
not now for gods sake
abe liz and agent mudd fan out moving cautiously toward the auctioneers overturned podium
abe discovers an empty cage
and on the iron door the embossed royal seal
abe hears a high pitched chitter chatter and looks around nothing
red im afraid i do detect some activity as the agent and liz inspect the other iron cages he extends his webbed fingers
what kind of creature
theres more than one
he hears a scratching noise
on the intercom more many more how many ten
maybe a hundred or two as hb nears a wall it bulges and splits open
the ceiling cracks too
he hurriedly loads a pair of lever action theyre all around us sounds of movement from burrowing unseen creatures what are they
uh if im right we should leave now and ask for backup
manning is holding forth in a sidewalk press conference
the situation is completely under control
earlier tonight customs agents discovered a few illegally imported items
this caused a minor confrontation
the reporters go wild with questions
federal agents have now taken over the premises
we ask that you all step back manning basks in the flashbulb glow and acknowledges a pretty young reporter
plaster spills from widening cracks in the wall
hellboy shoots blowing open a massive hole
he peeks inside small bodies burrow away like moles
what are they
abe finds a human femur wet and gnawed
ah i knew it
theyre vicious and cruel and the floor ripples with activity
have you noticed the floor
looking around uh thick rug deep pile light brown red there is no rug hellboy lifts his foot realizing hes been walking on an inch thick layer of ahem poo
aw crap precisely
these things have a very active metabolism
they um excrete as soon as they eat and then need to eat some more
there are no corpses cause there are no spit it out brother blue
what are they
alright but damn it abe just tell us
okay then theyre um tooth fairies
abe cmon cut the crap
she checks her boots sticky with poo third century the teutoburg forest
they feed on calcium and they do go for the teeth first
how do you think they got that name tooth fairies
liz senses movement in the darkness
she holds out her hand and starts a small fire on her palm
she pans it like a torch firelight sweeping the darkness agent marble comes upon a lonely little creature peeping out from a crack in the wall
its about inches high with olive skin and almond shaped eyes gleaming in the half light
it whimpers softly
hey this guy is cute i
he reaches out to touch it
are you scared buddy
across the room hellboy sees the agent nearing the fairy
no dont the thing snarls leaps and sinks its tiny teeth into marbles finger
then it dives under marbles shirt and goes to work
marble gasps and drops his gun
dozens of creatures emerge from the crack on the wall and crawl into marbles clothing
gasping he tears open his shirt as claws and teeth dig in
the agent falls
liz lights up both hands illuminating a surging tidal wave of hungry critters that engulfs the room gnawing at the wallpaper the furniture
the things sweep over agent mudd ripping into him like wriggling piranhas
backing away oh my hellboy protects the other agent but he feels the things swarming over him reaching for his lips and ears
bellowing in disgust he fires his shotguns splattering dozens of creatures onto the walls
every blast however reveals a buzzing hungry mass pouring from the walls
hb claws at dozens more which cling to him like baby monkeys
the room is awash with hissing creatures crawling over the iron cages
for an awful moment no sign of liz or abe
sudden panic in reply he hears a faint scream
he bats at the things with the shotgun wading further into the room
where are you
he sees a horde of little beasts gnawing at the metal bars of a cage
liz cowering inside
hellboy just has time to look deep into her eyes
a quick moment of silent communion
do it liz do it
and liz obeys
closing her eyes she the fires not my enemy
it is part of me gets covered by a gentle film of blue flame
he takes refuge as it is mine the gentle flame blooms into a cloud of fire
liz goes supernova
a ball of fire erupts from an upstairs balcony
the crowd and reporters look up amazed
evidently we have a gas pocket somewhere in the reporters stampede towards the explosion leaving manning alone and fuming
hey guys hey guys come back
az a int
sales room night hellboy stomps down hard popping some creatures bashing others with the butt of his shotgun
as flames leap up the things regroup and renew their attack
liz and abe run for the stairs
red red this way hellboy kicks the critters away shooting again and again
no ill deal with them now
he dumps his backpack and pulls out a belt full of vulcan grenades
holds it high
come and get em liz and abe take cover on the stairs
they see hellboy luring the tooth fairies toward the windows overlooking the street
as the creatures climb onto him he pulls the pins on all grenades
soon hes a mass of swarming gnarly fairies and no red not there
move away from the k b mmmmmm in
a massive explosion like a cannonball hb flies out the upper floor window
a ball of flame he arcs downward covered in fighting writhing fairies
below the onlookers scatter as the massive red giant lands in their midst cracking the pavement
liz and abe go to the window and look down
a tv camera lens into her radio hb
are you alright
the crowd is screaming
half a dozen smoldering fairies climb out of the smoking crater and snarl at the crowd
people shrink back in horror
one of the hungry critters jumps at a woman but blam
hellboy shoots it in mid air then calmly and efficiently shoots its fellows
finally he plucks one last creature off his coat
he holds it up by the tail like a rodent
manning hurries forward witness to his worst nightmare
a sea of camera flashes explodes on a grinning hellboy
looks at manning gee whiz manning i guess were out now
behind the credits are caballistic engravings suggesting the power size and weapons of a mystic mechanical golden army
demolition has begun on abandoned factories and rail sheds around an old roundhouse
a sign reads coming next summer camera booms down to a guard shack
guard watches tv
hb is on the screen surrounded by press and tv
check it out
that guys make up is so fake
i mean come on solid red guard is cleaning his gun
and whats with his forehead
is that goggles
he looks out the window and sees the the shadowy figure standing by the gates
hey we got us a wino
he grabs his nightstick and steps outside
waving his nightstick guard approaches the intruder
their elongated shadows loom up above them on a brick wall
hey buddy get the the the shadowy figure whirls and drops his coat
he unsheathes a long thin sword slicing the air around the guard
the guards shadow in the background is cut into three parts and collapses
guard tunes in a game show
looks outside no sign of his buddy
behind him at the window wink appears
its massive arm punches through the wall and hauls off the guard and then slams his massive iron mace down
the shadowy figure wipes off his sword over the crumpled remains of guard
screams and bone crunching can be heard
wink emerges from behind the shack
effortlessly the shadowy figure vaults the chainlink fence and walks into the roundhouse
wink smashes the fence and follows him through
a few pigeons flutter through a forest of steel pillars
radiant fingers of moonlight shine on the old train tracks
the shadowy figure and wink stop as a dozen royal guards in helmets and light armor march out from a tunnel
after a pause a chamberlain joins them
he bows low in a show of respect for the shadowy figure
prince nuada he awaits you please follow me sire
the chamberlain leads the way down a tunnel lined with more guards
the armed men surround the prince as they stop at an intersection
the prince prepares to unsheathe his sword wink growls
i beg you your majesty
before entering the chamber you surrender your sword
i will not
then i regret to say you may not see your father
it is the protocol sire
for peasant and prince alike
please for the last time surrender your sword
a tense beat and then the prince relents
the guards accept his weapon carefully pat him down mr
wink however cannot dispose of his weapon
he will wait here wink snorts as the prince is finally escorted through a huge rusting iron door
an abandoned machine shop functions as a council chamber
high ranking heads of outlandish magick families are there goblins trolls dwarves and elves
at the center sits king balor the one armed king of elfland and behind him the willowy beautiful princess nuala the princes sister
both on the kings chest and her own a large golden piece dangles from a chain
nualas resemblance to the prince is uncanny down to the fine scars marring their perfect faces
theyre ying and yang almost the same being
the prince eyes the doors closing behind him
the armed guards watch his every move
he bows his head and kneels
eyes the princess the king gestures for him to rise
why have you done this
his voice trembles with anger
the prince looks at him defiant
i have returned from exile to set us free
all of us father and to reclaim what has been taken from our people
the land and the freedom that is rightfully ours
no you have broken a truce that has lasted for centuries
a shameful truce worth nothing
how can you abide it
they have no respect for themselves their gods or the earth and they scorn us every time they raise a dead cold building destroy a forest or take more land
the princess then steps forward
what they do is in their nature
we must honor our side of the agreement honor
look at this place
is this where you hold court
is this how we are to live
amidst their filth in their rubble
picking at scraps from their table
where is the honor in that
and what would your solution be
it may just be that our days are ended
it may be but we will not go quiet
we will not fade like this
better to burn than fade away
and for this
prince nuada looks around locking eyes with the heads of the clans
well need the help of the good
and the worst he brings out the gold artifact from the auction
holds it high
the crowds gasps
the king instinctively covers the companion piece hanging from his chest as a medallion
no you cannot be that mad yes
this is the path you wish to take
knowing the cost
yes father it is
the king takes the princess hand and mournfully lowers his head
then i am sorry my son you leave me no choice
looks at his guards death
his two praetorian guards unsheathe their swords
death it is and the guards turn toward the king and stab him
the princess screams
the prince looks away as the old monarch tumbles from his throne dead
the heads of the clans try to flee but are kept at bay by the other guards
hear me all
there are some amongst you that have already seen the light he nears the guards seen the future
the praetorian guards cover his back as he leans forward to his father s corpse and snatches the medallion
as for you you may join us in our quest or die now his gaze is fierce inspired
he joins the pieces together they fuse and interconnect through the magical equivalent of nanotechnology
minute gears and hooks join the pieces seamlessly into an almost complete crown
the prince raises all of those in favor make it known
all of the family heads sheepishly bow their heads then kneel
good i see the council is as brave as its always been
and now my sister the prince looks around and sees that his sister is gone
he pushes through the mob pulling his guards to the door
find her find her his minions surge into the tunnels
clutching the medallion on her chest the princess runs down a tunnel
a crowd gathers behind her chasing her as she zig zags from tunnel to tunnel
with perfect calm she ducks into a niche then slides down a chute
she lands in a stone chamber lined with bookshelves
the princess rushes to a small cabinet
she grabs an ancient leather bound tome
she turns to leave but a horde of trolls rushes and quickly surrounds her
one of the beasts swings a heavy rusty sword
it opens a gash in the princess left arm the prince rushing through the tunnel with the praetorian guards suddenly doubles over cursing
blood pours from a wound in his left arm
no no you fools as another troll lifts his sword high calling out yrdrig
yrdrig a hellhound the size of a tank jumps out from an alcove
he has multiple heads all of them ferocious
in seconds hes upon the trolls
each of his many mouths tears into green flesh lifting and shaking the helpless monsters like rag dolls
the princess slips through a secret door
the prince and his guards rush through the tunnels as troll screams echo off the walls
when they finally reach the princess chamber its too late
dead and dying trolls lie in a heap on the floor
the prince finds no sign of his sister
he clutches his bleeding arm
liz sprawls on a sofa watching the odd tv monitors in hellboys room
all the news channels feature footage of heliboys outing the night before
hb is grinning at the camera
now hes signing an autograph
yes yes id say i am that strong ive fought many creatures over the years but none as strong as me he winks at camera
liz rolls her eyes
hellboy plunks himself down next to her popping a can of beer
i think i did good
and i looked good dont you think liz
abe stands behind them juggling a dozen remote controls
look theres manning
he raises the volume as manning is shown surrounded by microphones
evidently we have a gas pocket somewhere in a gas pocket
i love it
the door opens
manning is there holding a plastic box overflowing with mail
disgusted manning turns off the tvs
aw this is a disaster
a disaster you hear
worse than cheney with a shotgun
only liz only liz handled herself with any dignity
glancing at hb no one asked me anything
manning pulls a fistful of mail out and tosses it on a table
dont bother starting a fan club
its trending five to one against us
glances at some letters polls protests hate mail liz grabs a few letters and scans them
she glares at hellboy
you really did it this time im under review
to hellboy but so are you as of today theres a new team leader
yes you heard me
a new team leader
were to meet him at the conference room at looks at his watch now
the security pound is row after row of stacked cages each one imprisoning a different creature
bprd agents patrol the pens feeding the occupants cleaning the pans hb looks at manning who is edgy and nervous
whats the matter manning
dont you trust me anymore
oh i never did but after last night washington wants a new public face for the bprd what about me
whats wrong with my face
the press loves me
but now youve ruined it all but who
who is this guy
how would i know
evidently hes quite the big shot he reads a file his name is johann kraus akkk kraus
hes german a physical medium head of the european branch of the bprd you know i have a problem with germans a doctor in philosophy and occult practice from the
university of munich and a very eloquent speaker germans make me nervous i guess they need a nice open face a face people can trust
finally next to steel cage they meet johann kraus about tall dressed in a canvas containment suit full of tubes and taps
his hands are encased in thick latex gloves with exit valves at the fingertips and his head
oh my god is a translucent glass bubble full of gas
he is studying a drawing of the royal seal we saw on the fairy cages
johann approaches liz
he takes her hand and bows
johann kraus at your service
his unearthly voice is velvety and warm
hellboy glowers as kraus fishbowl head turns toward them
whispers to manning thats an open face for you
johann pulls out one of the dead singed fairies
hellboy and the others gather around him
poor things bought and sold on the black market
smuggled in tight cramped cages
lets see what they can remember memory gets pretty sketchy after you die nudges abe but maybe i can be of help nudges abe and starts fishing for an amulet
oh no no no amulets are required
he adjusts the valves at the tips of his fingers and approaches the lock
what are you doing
i can inhabit inanimate things organic exactly
a protoplasmic emanation seeps out from his fingertips slightly deflating his body
the tendrils enter the dead fairy
i can briefly take control of entities both mechanical and organic and reactivate their neural system the dead fairy snarls and bares its teeth at hellboy
two more do the same from another pen
points at hellboy you scare him the fairy blabbers furiously while glaring at hb
leering at it whaddayawant
you chewed off the tip of my tail yes you rough translation he says you are rude brutish and not too bright touche
more high pitched jabbering
johann replaces the little fairy in the holding pen
it seems our little friend here remembers a noise
a very peculiar noise in the last place where his cage was traded market sounds troll language the troll market
exactly miss sherman
the fairy starts babbling uncontrollably and grows pale and weak
jeez your buddy there doesnt look too good
im losing my grip on its limbic system he feels nauseous
im afraid hes about to die wow you have that effect on me too
the fairys cheekbones hollow and it finally collapses
ectoplasm escapes its body and regroups at johans fingertips
how can we find the troll market
its location has been a source of speculation for centuries yes well trolls dwell under bridges and vladimir vanya th century occultist places it under washington bridge weve looked there
before staked it out for weeks yes but this time i have asked for a very special piece of equipment he moves in to a large crate marked lot the schufftein glasses
smiles knowingly on loan from the smithsonian
plus we have this clue he produces the sketch of the royal seal
in my mind we have enough to go by any questions
abe is about to ask something when abruptly hellboy raises his hand yes what is it
if youre really german how come you dont have a funny accent
we are on the move
hellboy is suiting up
liz and abe do the same
what a moron
we are on the move he thinks hes so hot
weve been looking for that place for years and weve never found it looks at abe you said so abe pulls out two headsets of composite goggles made of copper
and glass full of buzzing and whirring pieces
he tries it on
get used to it
he might be here for good for good
he has a nice voice
yes very commanding very soothing
i think hes a jerk
i like him
well then youre a jerk too
the brains of the operation give me a break
they head towards the garbage truck
manning abe and are waiting there
i think you feel threatened
hellboy stays behind thinking thinking real hard
the garbage truck and a few other bprd vehicles crossthe washington bridge on the way to chinatown
hellboy rides in silence still thinking hard then
glaring at liz by whom
not just him this whole thing you did
the tv the reporters i did that
yes red absolutely
cause you did it without thinking you just wanted to be in the publics eye well youre there but so are we
hey we got some hate mail
well deal with it
he comes closer to her
something else bothering you
liz nods quietly
so tell me about it i will but not now im sorry if i i dont like being watched
i never have
i feel like a freak only if someones watching me
suddenly angry yells
then fists pounding the walls and fenders
the doors open and they are inundated by reporters and tv crews and cameras and flashes
there are literally hundreds of them
this time from all over the world japan uk germany
agents cordon off the street with yellow tape holding the press at bay
as the truck rolls by hordes of bystanders push forward hoping for a glimpse of hellboy
some of them chase run alongside the vehicle carrying support hatred signs
may i suggest that tonight you refrain from signing autographs
its the garbage truck
it makes the wrong statement
about who we are
you think thats what this is about
the truck stops near other official vehicles
overhead the soaring roadbed of the brooklyn bridge
at the sight of the bprd team some protestors throw eggs
hellboy shields liz from the barrage
cmon show us your powers oh no no no its not a parlor trick
what are you a mermaid
oh goodness no i you say you can read things things about people so read me cmon read me the crowd of reporters and onlookers laughs and applauds
what do you see
very well if you insist
webbed hand on reporters chest you
a large battery operated vibrating egg by your bedside
a shrieking camera crew runs up loaded with video equipment
will you take a dna test
its hellboy not demon man one of the projectiles hits him
the crowd roars
hellboy gazes back at them seething
let me take care of this
johann bravely confronts the news teams and the crowd
ladies and gentlemen my name is johann kraus and i beg you to allow us interrupted by catcalls please we need space to work please the reporters bombard him with
he signals for silence
in due time very soon we will provide all the answers you require all the whos whys and wherefors but for now an egg hits him in the face hard
the crowd roars great p
he gets ready to pummel the crowd
liz stops him
give him a chance
its been a long
for many decades really that the bprd has served you all of you
we have waged an unknown war but a very real one
heroes have died unrewarded and unrecognized so that you might go about your daily life
to work to marry to bid your children goodnight
little by little the crowd grows quiet
in exchange we have been consigned to the lies and racist innuendo of the tabloids
and there we have lived without complaint until now
johanns speech is replayed in broadcast tv vans homes pubs and bars all over the world to a fascinated human population
all colors and creeds
but perhaps soon after learning of our hardships and sacrifices you may decide that our humble lives may in some way have a value
and a meaning the camera lights reflect off johanns glass head
i pray that you will allow us to defend your good fortune to guarantee the blessing that is a peaceful nights sleep
a night free from monsters and nightmares
and if so chokes back tears if so then all we ask in return
is a little respect and the chance remote as it may be to prove ourselves worthy of a tiny tiny place in this gods earth
rolls his eyes this is sooo corny a moment of silence ensues then the wet eyed reporters applaud the crowd applauds liz applauds abe applauds
hellboy is agog
he has a nice voice
all business now johann steps over to the group
we have work to do hellboy abe and johann peer over the cornice of a bowling alley rooftop
the crowds are visible in the distance
hellboy looks through the schufften glasses
nothing yet sparky over the bprd truck is parked behind the bowling alley directly under the bridge
its back door is open liz and manning are at the communications center
i read you red
keep looking manning is bored looks at his watch
looking at what for goodness sake
looks at the schufften glasses what do these things do
liz starts locking and unlocking a series of lenses and prisms
both abe and johan wear similar gear
in emil schufften a good friend of benjamin franklin designed these optical sets with the intent of photographing fairies in england
lets get out of here were never going to find it hey sparky i think we got one
manning studies the image on the monitor a bag lady pushing a shopping cart full of cats that
oh please she looks as sweet as she can red turn on the antiglamour filter
to manning fairy folk use a spell called glamour to seem human and nice these lenses allow you to see their real appearance
bowling alley parking lot night bellboy turns a few knobs on the goggles then raises them
as a series filters enter the visual field the bag lady transforms into an ugly muscle bound troll
oh dear lord
what about the cats
she eats them
thats a she
were moving in sparky he johann and abe follow the bag lady
she opens a service the bag lady goes through the rear of the bowling alley and through a basement door
the room rumbles with the sound of rolling balls and toppling pins
maybe we can bowl a few frames uh
splays his webbed fingers bowling balls they give me trouble
how about a beer then
now that were out whaddya say mein herr
i dont drink
hellboy and abe enter the basement no sign of the old woman
just a warehouse adjust the prisms to abe moves his glasses hellboy fumbles his own unsuccessfully
now the whole room transforms under the new optical elements its geometry remains somewhat unchanged but instead of a pile of boxes a tree trunk and a large mossy rock
are visible where there were iron beams now tree trunks and stone columns are visible
where a large banner hung now a huge rusty mechanical lock
what the heck is that
a locking mechanism mmh ill take care of it he clenches his stone fist rears back
no you destroy it
well never get in he adjusts the valves at the tips of his fingers and approaches the lock
ah of course the fishbowl touch johanns s ecto tendrils enter the filling it making a few complex gears turn and move opens and the floor drops away revealing a
johann withdraws his protoplasmic tendrils and closes off the valves
gentlemen welcome to troll market
troll market is a steamy medieval nightmare
a labyrinth of narrow alleys and foetid vapour
trolls scavenge the crumbling marble shoreline picking through garbage scattering vermin
muddy water trickles down from above forming cloudy puddles
roaming vendors hawk exotic objects from every culture and century
at kiosks and shops trolls peddle cats skinned or alive cadres of lovecraftian entities stroll about mer men goblins and a few select species unknown to any cosmology
a dogfight of sorts is taking place in a small ring
instead of pitbulls multi limbed creatures leap at one another while violent bettors laugh and shout
at the rail abe watches in horror then sees a woman in rags making her way through the crowd
he catches a glimpse of her slippered feet
which flash with pearls and gold embroidery
his curiosity aroused he follows her
the woman inspects a pile of ancient bric a brac at a market stall her cowl swings aside briefly revealing her face
its the princess
in these grotesque surroundings her beauty is transcendent
abe is thunderstruck
as she turns to leave they briefly make eye contact
on her bandaged arm a bracelet adorned with the seals coat of arms
into microphone brother red
not now abe
as the princess disappears into the mob abe hurries after her
hellboy and johann show a picture of a tooth fairy to a surly shop owner
never seen anything like it
no one sells em down here over in jersey maybe
behind him theres a faceless cave berserker a tall and gnarly ogre his naked chest crisscrossed with scars his feet encased in iron shoes
growling it bares its teeth at he
hb smiles back hiya chuck abe follows the princess down an alley and then another one narrow and dark
panhandlers pull at his belt he bats them away
now johann shows a drawing of the royal seal to the shop owner
what about this
do you recognize this seal
the shop owners face suddenly grows pale
youd better go
well make it worth your while
the shop owner claps his hands
berserker takes two steps forward roaring
its iron shoes go clomp clomp
hes not friendly hellboy huffs and walks up to the creature
well neither am i bammmm
with a single uppercut he sends it flying toward the ceiling shoeless
the shop keeper watches in awe until it lands about thirty feet away in the middle of the dogfight
the crowd scatters as the mongrel creatures attack the thing with blind instinct
hellboy grabs the shop owner by the lapels and pulls him close
the shop owners head rockets back and forth like a boxers speed bag as hb gently slaps him around
teeth fly everywhere
feeling more chatty now
just no dont hit me all right
theres talk of a revolt a revolt against the human world hellboy releases him then looks around
where the hell is abe
he pushes his belt locator
troll market alley maze night the princess has entered a shop selling maps and prints
abe stays outside watching through a window as she negotiates to purchase a silver and crystal cylinder contained in a safety holding case
the salesman denies it at first but after the princess hands him a gold bracelet he finally acquiesces while vowing to her
he extracts the cylinder from its holding case and hands it to her
a red locator light flashes on abes utility belt
hey abe gimme me your twenty im following a lead red
keep your locator
a large troll cuts him off excuse me what do you think youre doing
are you in trouble
talk to me abe
another troll comes up behind abe
i dont think you the troll opens a small wooden box and extracts a nasty looking insect a narcotic bug
oh my the second troll loads the buzzing bug like a bullet into a blowpipe
abe turns just as he blows
the bug lands on abes chest and sinks its stinger deep into his flesh
abe tears it loose and crushes it underfoot
but his vision blurs he staggers forward and falls face first onto the cobblestones
come in abe
dammit the locators blue light dims concerned hellboy and johann look at each other
seeing his chance the shop keeper melts away into the crowd
abe opens his eyes and slowly gets up
he looks around hes surrounded by racks of ancient scrolls and musty books
the door is locked
instinctively he looks for his belt its not there
if you are looking for your weapons my guards took them
abe turns to face the princess who stands only a few feet away
she has cast off her dingy cloak and is radiant in fine silk robes
she is feeding slices of fruit to a cage of large featherless reptile birds
i i carry no weapons madam i assure you
why were you following me
abe is ashamed to realize the real answer
hes utterly beguiled by her
are you seeking to join my brother
in his revolt against the humans
no no no i you are sorely mistaken
he takes a step forward but the yrdrig comes out of nowhere barking and growling
then answer me truthfully why were you following me
my name is abe sapien there is no such name
horrible i know but please hear me i beg you
i am an agent of the bureau for paranormal research and defense
if we can assist you give me your hand
abe complies thrilled as she runs her fingers over his palm
the princess face brightens
she smiles and gestures for the yrdrig to yield
down yrdrig hes a friend
the yrdrig jumps on abe and starts licking him with all three tongues
yrdrigs really just a puppy
the drooling beast pins abe to the floor with one paw
the yrdrig lifts abe with one of its mouths and gives him playful shake
my father gave him to me
yrdrig leave our guest alone the yrdrig drops abe onto the floor
as the animal skulks away she helps abe up bows her head my name is princess nuala
bows his head your highness the honor is all mine
may i apologize mr
sapien for the manner in which we brought you here
couldnt be too sure
she offers him the locator belt
please it was nothing
love the puppy and under diplomatic immunity may i seek asylum
we would be
honored im sure
but may i ask from whom do you seek asylum
suddenly a commotion outside
the door flies off its hinges
hellboy and johann burst in leaping over a pile fallen guards outside
im all right
the princess shrinks back but abe motions for calm
some respect please
the princess looks with dismay at her vanquished bodyguards
the narcotic bugs buzz around hb who swats them like mosquitoes
and that was my royal guard
red apologize at once
we are in the presence of
hellboys never heard abe sound like this giddy as a schoolboy
to abe youre vouching for her i take it
oh most definitely
shes from an ancient noble line of warriors
the children of the earth
to the princess im sorry princess nuala
with such a fierce bloodline we cannot take your claim of allegiance at face value
he produces the ancient seal
standing at a long deal table the princess lights a candle and examines the ancient seal
where did you get this
human side two nights ago the princess studies their faces
in ancient times a seal like this was delivered to the enemy as a declaration of war
a signal from the underground realm to the entire world
it prefaced the awakening of the golden army johann sits down heavily
i feared as much
to johann what
a goblin army
johann shakes his glass head overcome with worry
the unstoppable tide
there has been nothing to substantiate such a not a tale at the dawn of time
even before the great flood man and the children of the earth shared this planet
she sighs but as man in his greed expanded his dominion there ensued a bitter war
silhouetted against a crimson sky the shadows of thousands upon thousands of goblins elves and fairies do battle with hordes of men
in those days my people were led by my father king balor the one armed king of elfland
king balor fights valiantly at the side of his son the tall pale elf knight prince nuada
the bloodshed went on year after year
many lives were lost
an overview of the battlefield fades as the sun sinks below the horizon
seated in an opulent throne room king balor addresses a wretched guild of deformed goblins
it was then that the king ordered the sigri to build him a new invincible army
lit by the fires of a hundred furnaces stoked by scores of goblins a mechanical army is born
metal plates and moving parts are hammered into shape on enormous anvils and bolted onto tall ornate golden figures
this was an army that would not eat drink or grow tired
a heartless ruthless force made of the purest metal mined from the depths of the earth
in perfect ranks in eerie unison the golden soldiers line up filling the entire courtyard awaiting the kings command
the sigri worked until the winter moon was high in the sky the chief goblin blacksmith displays three curved segments of gold
he fits them together and holds a completed crown directly over the kings head
i am king balor leader of the golden army
is there anyone here who disputes my right
prince nuada kneels next to his father
the goblin crowns the king who lifts his sword
in response tchankkkkk
the new army raises its lances hailing him
as the humans make ready for battle a tremor shakes the earth
they turn their gaze to the horizon which bristles with the arms of the approaching troops
the fight is brutal
the mechanical soldiers mow down the humans by the hundreds their swords replaced as needed by battle axes bludgeons and lances
but this army knew no bounds had no remorse felt no loyalty engaging in blind battle with man woman or child
the horde crushes everything with swords slicing through armor as if it were paper
every blow is deadly precise
the army marches ever onward like a grinding machine devouring tender flesh
at length there is no sign of life in the human camp
and as the king gazed upon the earth awash in blood and at the impassive metal faces of the army he had created his heart grew heavy
victory was gained at too high a price
this war should never have been waged
the king surveys the carnage
the mechanical soldiers stand in symmetrical ranks awaiting further instructions
and so he arranged a truce the surviving men would keep to their cities and we children of the earth would dwell within the forests
this pact he declared would be honored by our sons and the sons of their sons until the end of time
listening to his father prince nuada reacts with anguish
but my brother did not believe in the promises of men
he marched off into exile vowing to return if the sons of the earth ever needed him
prince nuada walks away towards a dying sunset
the goblins lock the golden army into a huge cavern under the light of ten thousand flickering torches
and the golden army was ordered to lie dormant locked inside the earth itself and there it is to this day waiting for the wearer of the crown to command
the princess finishes her tale
hellboy and johann look at each other
where is that crown
my father had it destroyed
cut into three pieces
one for mankind
she holds up her piece of the puzzle which dangles from a chain around her neck
two for the sons of the earth
so you do need our help
im afraid its the other way around
she holds the cylinder she purchased
the location of the golden army is contained within this cylinder she opens it and produces a parchment hidden inside
she extends it the map just shows three coordinates
just a global chart edo thats the old name for tokyo moscow and renvyle here but nothing else she rolls back the map into the cylinder
so far this is a family matter
to intervene will bring nothing but trouble
good i like trouble
the princess leads the group through the surging noisy crowd of bizarre creatures
hellboy johann and abe bring up the rear
no not that way
too risky theyre lost in unfamiliar alleys and byways
until finally pointing there
stairs to the street
the prince appears at the top of the stairs dressed in black
hes surrounded by his elite guard
stepping to the rail he points at his sister and addresses the crowd hear me o creatures of the forest
can you recognize a traitor
shes here to betray her own
he casts a disdainful look at hellboy
im here to recruit all of you against the humans
make your decision now
those who join me will be rewarded
will be killed
a sudden silence falls over the throng
then the sound of cracking knuckles
everyone looks at hellboy who is unclenching his fists and stretching his neck
he starts up the stairs but a couple of the guards leap down to block his path
im gonna put this as delicately as i can
a crowded bowling alley is full of serious looking players in colorful shirts and shoes
someone rolls a ball down the center lane and as it speeds right at the pins
look out manny
hellboy erupts from under the floorboards fighting the clawing monsters right behind him
as the bowlers freeze in shock dozens of creatures pour out into the human world
grunting hellboy punches his way free only to be dragged back by the tail by wink
abe shielding the princess demonstrates the way of the water a fluid martial arts display
he ducks and parries the blows leaping like nureyev
abe scoops up a couple of bowling balls and rolls them at the princes guards
he manages to knock a couple off their feet
as they get back up he uses the available bowling pins as clubs
the screaming patrons rush for the doors
outside the civilians flee but the news crews come is back
as their lights blaze up reporter gapes in disgust hellboys massive hands are wrapped around the neck of a sweet little old lady
he beats her mercilessly
to his cameraman oh my god
oh my roll
roll on this
its not what you think
pointing at hb hes lost his mind
hes worse than any of them
cut back to hellboy revealing that the old lady is actually liz runs over with a prism from the schufftein goggles and sticks it in front of the camera lens
revealing the truth
the reporter checks his monitor
all the bprd team including liz is swept up in this fight
the denizens of the troll market overturn parked cars and knock down lamp posts roaring with excitement
the fire is not my enemy it is a part of me liz yells out a warning
and then throws a barrage of flaming bolts
a pair of crab like things shrivel and burn
johann melds with a heavy steel dumpster until only his legs are visible beneath it
bending at the waist splat he brings it down on the head of the nearest creature
wink and hb duke it out for a few beats and then hb finally vanquishes the troll ripping his iron mace off and throwing it away
as the other monsters retreat
the prince appears in his hand a complex mechanical grenade
immediately worried abe hustles the princess over to the bprd truck
the prince twists a timer
his bloodied trolls disperse screaming renewing the panic
to hellboy i will find you young daemon to nuala and you too my sister
meanwhile heres a taste of what lies in store
he throws the grenade
hellboy dives just in time to catch it
hes about to throw it down a sewer when he listens to its clockwork innards then ping
its a dud your royal assness
the prince has disappeared along with his horde
how do you like that
just when i was loosening up
hellboy scrutinizes the grenade as it opens up like a beans
and spews out a handful of brightly colored pick them up
relax its jumping beans
abe is scrambling to retrieve them
do as i say
with a sigh hellboy scoops up a few
how many do you have
three how about you
theres always seven
find the last one
the seventh bean is next to a manhole
it hops closer edge
quick its going for water
hellboy reaches for it
but its too late
the thing hops into the manhole and lands somewhere below with a splash
oh my god evacuate the area
abe please get a grip
a rumble from below their feet
a huge tree punches up through the pavement overturning cars knocking buildings off their foundations and ripping up through the bridge overpass
picking up speed the tree branches soar up up up
into the moonlit clouds
hellboy approaches the massive trunk gazing up in fascination
birds and creatures emerge from the inside and flutter around grass overtakes pavement and for a moment chinatown looks like the garden of eden
just like the story books
manning and liz take a few steps into it a squirrel being climbs on lizs shoulder and a couple of iridescent hummingbirds fly around her ala snow white
a small crowd starts wandering into this idyllic scenario
this is so beautiful so perfect so peaceful hey
the prince at the base of the tree
knocking on it hey jhonny apleseed what are you
oh jeez did you have to do that
liz starts pulling manning away and yelling at the crowd back go back right now
what is he doing
hes knocking on wood summoning an an elem a forest spirit that lives in that tree
hes releasing it oh and is it that bad
the tree trunk rumbles and shakes under some enormous force
huge leaves tumble to the street
even the ever present news crews back away as a huge shape descends
the trunk rips in two revealing a curled dormant five stories high fierce as nature
the elemental steps out of the tree and stares at hellboy
uttering a weird guttural sound the giant raises an arm and pulverizes a gasoline truck
flames leap up
the elemental grins with delight turning his baleful gaze on the princess
as she shrinks back her pet yrdrig rushes at the thing snarling
in a single leap it sinks its teeth into the elementals heel
to elemental now woody
you want to fight someone you fight with me
hellboy humorously adopts a kung fu pose as in bruce lee
the elemental hops forward new branches sprout from his limbs shaking the yrdrig off
to the princess this may not be the best place for you your majesty
with your permission
he offers the princess his arm
she takes it and allows abe to lead her away
a moment later the elemental smashes the ground where they had been standing
every time the elemental moves he trails behind roots and branches
the roots connecting to its feet and leading to the original tree trunk like an umbilical cord
johann sees this i have a plan he looks at abe as the fishman helps the princess up into the rear of the bprd garbage truck
up front behind the wheel liz starts the engine
hellboy climbs a fire escape as the elementals arm branches extend and grow over the ladder pulling it down below his feet
hellboy ducks into one of the open windows as the elemental tears away the rest of the scaffolding
growing and discarding branches and roots
hellboy runs like a cockroach through a dilapidated kitchen
behind him the elementals massive branch fist crashes through the wall then pursues him as he runs down a corridor littered with debris
like a wrecking ball the elemental demolishes each section of the corridor as hellboy runs
hellboy steps out onto a ledge ten stories up just out of reach of the elemental
to the elemental what now big boy
you get a ladder
the elemental jumps up and down trying to reach him barking in frustration
hellboys radio crackles on the radio hb
this is blue
the princess is fine
so lead him to the bridge
hellboy looks over the buildings and sees the brooklyn bridge in the distance
thats nine blocks from here fishbowl
youll figure it out
whats at the bridge
muttering hellboy climbs higher up a buzzing neon sign reading hotel
the elemental smashes the letters tel
so hellboy climbs the to the roof
liz drives the garbage truck toward the brooklyn bridge
johann is sitting next to her
hellboy makes a running start and leaps off the building
he sails over the alley reaches for the approaching cornice
and almost loses his grip
he hangs on for dear life
behind him the elemental appears climbing onto an adjacent roof
as his feet smash through the skylights the elemental pulls down a water tower
a wall of water rolls toward hellboy like an ocean wave
hellboy leaps to the next roof
and the water shoots over the edge of the building cascading onto the street below
liz parks the truck near the brooklyn bridge
using binoculars abe peers out the back doors to see hellboy bringing the elemental closer
johann theyre almost here
johann moves among massive construction machinery
he stops at a stack of heavy spools of cable
abe comes running pointing at the cable
i had the very same idea
he gets behind the levers and handles of a complex machine which holds a half mile of steel cable
gazing at the controls but how do you operate this
if youll permit me
johann opens his fingers and plunges both arms deep into the mechanism
instantly the diesel engine starts up
to abe stand back abe
a hydraulic strut lifts the spool then pitches it through the air spinning off yards of cable
it splashes down near the far shore of the east river
now tie it onto the pontoons on the other side
seeing hellboy coming quickly abe
abe races down a pier and dives smartly into the dark water
then he surfaces surging dolphin like toward the manhattan shore
hellboy makes it to the bridge
as behind him the elemental wades into the river pushing aside boats and barges
abe makes it to the other side surfacing with the cable towing it to a half submerged pontoon
on the radio macht schnell
abe make it fast
the cable is a yard short of the anchor point
abe tugs on i need more
no more available
the elementals feet stomp through the river he stumbles as he encounters the submerged cable
clinging to the cable abe is dragged down down down
past rusting cars oil drums
and a couple of rotting corpses their feet in tubs of cement
suddenly abes head strikes a sunken truck knocking him unconscious
blood seeps from his wound
as hellboy climbs one of the bridge towers he hears someone calling out from above to hellboy havent you managed to kill it yet
you who were so eager for a fight
the prince is standing on top of the tower
he points at hellboy then yells at the elemental
to the elemental over here dear friend
the elemental plucks hellboy off a parapet
hellboy wriggles in the massive wooden finger like appendages
the prince walks to the edge of the tower near a steel spire his coat flapping in the night wind
this might be a good chance for you to come to your senses
ive been all through this
the answers still no
far below johann slips his right arm into the cable bringing it to life whipping it back and forth like a steel snake
the cable forms a huge loop splashing down near the elemental and tightening around his ankles
the cable to liz burn the roots
i he points at the roots trailing into the river
liz concentrates and a bolt of fierce white hot energy pours out of her hands burning the roots at the elementals feet
johann gyrates the cable responds whipping up out of the river
with a bellow the elemental loses his balance he tosses hellboy high into the air
on the way down hellboy grabs a support stay and swings back and forth like a red monkey
he lands atop of the elementals back right behind his head
nap time big guy he raises his stone fist and hits him straight in the back of the neck
the cable tenses the elemental pitches forward the prince looks up to see the elemental falling right at him his mouth opens as if to scream
the elemental goes down impaling himself on a spire atop the bridge
exactly where the prince had been standing
putting an end it seems to both of them
the creature dies but even as it does its branches embrace the steel structure and grow ultimately blocks and blocks of the city are now covered in trees and grass
and mossy leaves
a strangely beatific and precious change
liz runs up looking out at the river as abe emerges bleeding but alive
abe liz and johann embrace firmly laughing and happy to be together
abe eyes the princess standing nearby smiling back at him
hellboy meanwhile observes the group from a distance jealous alone
deafening shots as hellboy blasts the samaritan again and again at a target in the dark firing range
hits a button brings the paper close for inspection
result a very ragged loose pattern around the bulls eye
suddenly from the next alley rapid gunfire
johann leans over and to address hellboy through a cloud of gunsmoke
youll permit a small criticism
you take too much time to aim to think
just point like afinger as if you wish for something
oh i wish for something
johann brings his target close a beautiful tight cluster of shots dead center
speed is of the essence
you must work on it
im willing to spend some johann reaches for his loader accidentally knocks heliboys onto the floor
hey watch it
youre winding me up i dont like it
on the contrary
hellboys in the shower glaring across the room where johann stands at a mirror polishing his glass head with a terry cloth towel
you keep wiping that thing like shes gonna care
you know who she shes not gonna care
long beat you think im after liz dont you
hellboy walks out well im not
not good enough for you
hellboy wraps a towel around his waist and comes up behind johann
well from now on you dont come near her
you dont talk to her you forget
im part of the team now such interactions are inev well you better start making them evitable thats not a word yes it is no it isnt hellboy raises his
now it is oh i see you want to punch me thats how you win an argument
well youre big ill give you that much give me
you dont give me sh and youre strong but youre slow
very slow ive seen your fighting style
very slow wham
hellboy cracks johann over the head with his massive fist
to his surprise the johanns glass ball cranium shatters
slow enough for ya
with a loud hisss johanns odd suit sags to the floor
sorry i i got carried away
leaning over the empty suit johann
you still hear me
an ectoplasmic tendril reaches out from the suit and penetrates the closest locker
it was an accident okay
ill get you some help with a clang
the bank of lockers comes to life
metal doors smack hellboys head repeatedly like a pinball machine
his face imprinted in the metal
speed is the key
the vaporous form of johanns body emerges from the lockers and wanders away
the locker room doors open and close as he goes by
hellboy tries to stand wobbles and sits
abe floats in his tank smiling at the princess whos at one of the book stands reading to him
i sometimes have a queer feeling especially when you are near me as now it is as if i had a string somewhere under my left ribs tightly and inextricably
knotted to a similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little frame
i love this part
i am afraid that cord of communion will be snapt and then ive a nervous notion i should take to bleeding inwardly
she closes the book looking troubled
charlotte bronte died shortly before i was born
it would have been a great privilege to have known her
this jane eyre
i understand its only a story but such a tie that binds it exists between me and my brother
i assure you my brother hes not dead how can you know
we all saw we are twins
even now i can sense his presence
this has been our way since we were young children in renvyle renvyle ireland the ancient isles a magical place in the west
a different time
now hes near and hes looking for me
i can feel and even understand his
hatred for mankind
usually mean well i believe that
but they need our help and patience
you were very brave vouching for me
how do you know im not the enemy bringing me here
its as you were saying i suppose
from intuition feeling
ive never met anyone like you
but thats my instinct
they gaze fondly at each other through the glass as bubbles swirl out of abes gills
liz is patching hellboys injured head
in the background the tvs are playing up city lights white heat and some tv programming
he caught me off guard but ill get him next time
hes examining a few letters contract forms etc
there shouldnt be a next time were all part of the same team
we are hes not the guys an egomaniac
you can see right through him
thats a joke liz
liz remains silent
raises a letter look
they wanna do a cartoon series based on me
and this he holds up a box of cereal product endorsement breakfast of demons
and a videogame
as city lights ends liz lifts the remote to turn the volume up
gosh that was so sweet so sad it always gets me red theres something i need to taking the remote no wait
switching to leno look thats us jay is showing some footage from the giant incident
so this hellboy what is he
is he really on our side
i mean hes red has a tail and shaves his horns horns ladies and gentleman
horns are never a good sign
ha hes funny
maybe we should have him come over and talk to us a little uh
the crowd roars
thats a great idea dont you think
no i dont did you know that during the commercial breaks the orchestra keeps playing so the guest cant talk to jay
keeps the conversation fresh
how do you know these things
i read it in tv guide
youre really liking this arent you
we should do this its a bad idea
all of it do you really need everybody to like you
whats in it for you
are we not enough
hellboy glances at leno on tv a dog outfitted in a ballerina costume is jumping around with a red ball balanced on its nose
liz is looking out into trenton njs light landscape
johann approaches her
are you alright
liz nods weakly
may i be of assistance
hes a big brute isnt he
but he has a good heart
i know it
he means well
i think i may have made a mistake
in what way mein frau
just a mistake nothing important
but sometimes being with him is not easy it never is
lis looks at him with renewed interest
i was married once
a long long time ago
and only after i lost her i realized that my life would never be quite the same and my loss lead me to become what i am today
johanns human face materializes inside his glass helmet
i i tried constantly to make contact with her johanns mouth opens and out of it emerges a large tendril of ectoplasm
his neck engorges and the substance continues to flow freely out of his mouth and fingertips it was only there in the ethereal plane that i ever gazed upon her
camera close in on several ceremonial candles burning in the room
their flame illuminating the eerie scene
out of the mouths of the other guests emerge other equally large ectoplasmic shapes
they cross to once there they reform into humanoid shapes vaguely reminiscent of their mortal bodies
johann floats freely approaching another humanoid form in the void that of a woman his wife
but it was there while he was partially on the ethereal plane that disaster he is about to embrace his wifes form when a horrible rumble occurs and the void
bursts in flames destroying and distorting everything around him his wifes shape screams and evaporates
bprd agents break in on the scene
smoke and flames billow in the room wax puddles stand where the ceremonial candles were and seated around the seance table charred corpses hold hands in eternal contact
as the agents move around a pale vaporous shape emerges from the soot stained darkness its johann
all the seance attendees were incinerated
the only survivor and only to some extent was me why
ill never the form moves towards its body and attempts to climb back and reanimate it but the charred corpse is barely amble to amble a few steps forward before
collapsing into ash and bone
the shape of ectoplasm stands there alone and lost then professor trevor broom wanders into the scene and approaches the form it was then that professor broom and the b
devised a containment suit for me
a new body camera pulls back to reveal johann back in the balcony talking to liz
i owe professor broom everything that ive become
he brought me back to life he grows silent for a brief moment
but ive never been able to see her again
my reach became limited my loss infinite
liz puts her hand on his shoulder
johann takes it
loss the very threat of it makes us vulnerable
makes us care you can see that dont you
without her i became but an empty shell
liz leans her head on his shoulder
dont give up on him
camera discovers hellboy watching them from behind a glass door a six pack in his hand
he steps away
heliboy walks down a deserted corridor carrying his six pack
he stops puzzled
strains of barry manilow are emanating from the library
hellboy enters the library and goes over to the tank
abe is there listening to vivaldi
ah hello red
youre up late
liz and i we had a fight hellboy eyes the cd player
did i hear barry manilow just now
smiles hypocritical barry m oh gosh no no fast stammering it was er urm vivaldi
il cimento dellarmonia i believe i particularly admire the passage
hellboy hits the eject button on abes cd player
the music stops and he pulls out a different cd from the changer
whats happening to you
ooh ooh all my life i thought i was alone a made up name and a random pasted on a cylinder
but then i saw her shes like me
a creature from another world
brother red i think im in love
you say that like its a good thing
looks at the cd what track
track eight oh god youre disgusting i know cant smile without you id cry but i dont have the glands for it
what am i going to do red
hellboy sighs and pops a beer presses play and sighs heavily looks around i miss him father dont you
he would tell what to do he would tell whats right whats wrong he did that for all of us
the opening strings of cant smile without you
sips beer you know
i i never much appreciated manilows artistry that much until now now it seems to be a grand poet and speaks directly to my innermost feelings
jeez you need to get out more the two of them sit there growing quiet listening to the syrupy music
then slowly the two of them start singing low at first and then at the top of their voices moved and teary eyed
the princess hears the distant music and smiles but then feels a chill down her spine
she shudders and moves to the panoramic window and gazes outside to the woods and the distant city lights below
the music can be heard at a distance
a dark figure stands on a hill amid the trees listening and watching
camera moves in the prince gazes at the building
manning strides down the corridor followed by the bprd team
all of them dressed in black leather outfits
this is a whole new ballgame and i want you to take my lead
i find these leather outfits very maybe so maybe so but they look hip
when it comes to dealing with reporters or the public i set the tone
you all know the old saying the perception is the reality
for one thing we can ditch the garbage truck right
wait red the labs in it screw the lab
i want new wheels
you got em the round a corner and enter three gleaming hummers await them
a gift from general motors
one for each of you
each hummer has custom paint hellboys with scenes of dantes inferno lizs with flames and abes with an underwater vista
this is more like it
im not driving that abe has opened the hood on his hummer
this is a most unfortunate vehicle
the sheer waste of precious fossil fuels
an american custom its called product placement
whats the harm
a mob of screaming fans outside the tv studio
the frenzy intensifies when they see the hummers pulling up
as the bprd team exits the cars autograph seekers break through the police line and swarm around the heroes
every agent on the field is on the case
they will solve it hellboy signs a color photo of himself with a flourish
there you go pal
to jason best wishes hellboy
squints at the signature how am i supposed to read that
you dont like it
irritated he scowls at the fan
manning takes him by the elbow and leads him away
to the fan that turns up on e bay im gonna find you jason
a row of makeup chairs
manning sits in the first one looking at himself in the mirror
can you do anything about this
lowers his voice double chin
no youre not being made up
they said youre too normal
you dont need anything
but believe me im not normal at all
camera moves to the next makeup chair where makeup girl holds a camelhair brush and stares dubiously at abe
so what color is that green
carribbean blue actually
camera moves to the next makeup chair where the very sexy makeup girl gingerly touches hellboys chest
are these really scars
each one tells a story his grin fades as he sees johann talking to liz
he abruptly gets up and goes to them
that about you glass man
a few squirts of windex
im not going on
and if i may a word of long beat then sotto voce its not a good idea to hint that you two have
thanks a bunch
ill decide that
you dont know how people may react
its a love story
theyll lap it up
i know you dont like me but trust me on this one
i knew your father he was a friend hellboy blinks taking the information in
do as you may but know this he wouldnt have approved of your behaviour
opens the door
ill be watching from the truck lab where i belong go enjoy your fifteen minutes
he walks away
a busy moscow subway station not very crowded at this time of night
sleepy patrons await the arrival of the subway
one of them a puppet vendor showcases his product
he manipulates a wooden marionette a knight in shining armor
in the distance lights bright lights and the train roar
the puppeteer readies his merchandise bag and quickly moves to the edge of the platform alongside other passengers
the lights grow in intensity and the roar becomes deafening
but somethings wrong really wrong hooy na ny
the lights are in reality the eyes of a giant dragon and it roars into the platfrom demolishing pillars crushing people and eating the puppeteer in a matter of second
a warning light goes off on the trucks global positioning but johann and the other agents are too absorbed watching the leno show on the bank of monitors
ladies and gentlemen yesterday we saw some extraordinary things on tv
and tonight youre in for more
jay leno grins and pulls his microphone close
please extend a warm warm welcome to hellboy liz sherman abe sapien and special agent tom manning
uproarious applause as the bprd team comes out and make their way to the couch
alone in the bprd conference room the princess is watching the show
the massive yrdrig is curled up at her feet
wow so hes pointing at manning
what planet are you from
its hot and inhospitable to human life
to liz why are you just liz and not fire girl
i was born in milwaukee so it was just plain old liz ever since first grade
hey we do call her sparky now and then
a chuckle from the crowd
hellboy smiles in satisfaction
to abe and you abe
is it uncomfortable at night with that toilet seat around your neck
the princess smiles as the camera singles out abe for a closeup
leno my lungs are more like gills
i need to convert the airs nitrogen into oxygen otherwise id suffocate in five minutes
we call that stand up comedy
johann is groaning
this is turning unpleasant
behind him the maps lights are lightning up non stop
so hellboy whats your favorite food
devils food cake
do you have a last name
more laughter at hb
she touches hbs hand to restrain him
cameras zoom in on this
whats that are you two an item
i to liz care to comment on that
sounds like youre contemplating marriage
after a big pause you know jay we are together
rumble of consternation from the audience
manning i think your polls just tanked
he turns to see the map lit like a christmas tree
mein gott leno smiles at the audience which is buzzing
folks this is modern america
a guy in rhode island married his motorcycle
whats a little inter species romance in this day and age
scattered booing from the back row
jay turns back to okay heres what weve really been wondering is he just like every guy
in every respect
i mean he looks like a guy
leno continued and if so are you using any protection
a layer of asbestos might be in order dont you think
liz tenses up in silence
holds tight to hbs hand
hellboy is ready to explode
as a matter of fact jay before she can finish the production assistant runs out and hands a note to leno who scans it and grows serious we were getting
pre empted ladies and gentlemen
please bare with us
well be right back camera pushes in on one of the monitors news footage of the ginza features yokai ghosts on a rampage destroying the stores and attacking salarymen
this is a news alert
tokyo is under assault repeat this city has been attacked
monstrous beings defying description have waded into the ginza the jumpy handheld images are full of digital interference
the spectral beasts drag down power lines and hurl cars
where police are helpless and hospitals overwhelmed
one moment please
come in moscow
red square moscow now seen in similar shaky video
hundreds of citizens are running from a towering dragon
this is cnn in moscow where a dragon has laid claim to red square
yes a dragon
the dragon heads towards the tv reporter and screeching it raises its paw
oh my god
camera goes down then the picture winks out
the hiss of static
pan off the monitor to jay leno who sits in stunned silence like everyone else
finally he looks over at hellboy
friends of yours
then may i ask what youre doing here
shouldnt you be out protecting humanity instead of hooking up with our women
at last hellboy explodes
bellowing he rips up the desk and throws it through the backdrop
the princess snaps off the tv looking worried
alone with her thoughts she examines the curved gold piece hanging from a chain around her neck
she closes her eyes and shudders trouble is near
the yrdgrig wakes up and whimpers
video cameras record the journey of the princess as she makes her way through the nearly deserted corridors
a video surveillance camera in the bprd library records the princess as she crosses to abes tank
she hides the gold segment within the pages of jane eyre
at that moment the yrdrig growls shhh its all right boom
a jolt shakes the room
a moment later a wall collapses as warty heavily muscled arms and fingers tear at the masonry
in seconds a squad of trolls pulls itself into view
wink leers at the princess
from her waistband she produces a long thin dagger and wields it timidly
somewhere in the building alarms start clanging
the yrdrig shakes himself into action and springs
with a snarl it attaches its several jaws onto the nearest trolls
as the fighting creatures crash into the spiral staircase the princess hears a familiar voice hold
the prince steps into the room carrying a long spear
the trolls are on top of the yrdrig ready to kill him
the trolls release the yrdrig and bound over to the prince
the last troll however grabs the yrdrig by the neck and brutally twists
the animals three mouths yelp and cough fighting for air
the it thrashes pathetically until suddenly its over beast is dead
where is your sense of shame
you mingle with
alarms are ringing as the hummers pull into the underground parking garage
manning and hellboy jump out of their vehicle and see a couple of dead agents sprawled on the loading dock
what in gods name
hellboy abe liz and johann race past him disappearing into the building
the alarm bells are deafening
hellboy leads the way down the corridors which are alive with scrambling personnel
several bprd employees are lying on the floor wounded and confused
the top level human agents are clustered in the lobby their guns drawn all of them aiming at the prince and his drooling bodyguards
as hellboy and the team arrive abe sees the princess her arms tied
her brother holds her by the hair
without thinking he darts forward
instantly one of the trolls swipes at him its claws just missing his chest abe
no get back
abe regains his balance and tries again his eyes glued to the desperate features of the beautiful young woman
hellboy manages to restrain him
hell kill you
ill kill you all if thats what you want
why dont you just start with me
hellboy strolls up to the prince
you challenge me
you bet your ass i do your weapon of choice
holds up his massive hand five fingered mary
in the background manning arrives wide eyed
just in time to see the prince hand off his captive to one of the trolls
he drops back flips his spear to horizontal and waits for hellboys attack
hellboy feints left goes right and whips around swinging his tail at the prince
the prince leaps and jabs with the spear poking a hole in hellboys coat
the surrounding crowd backs away as the combatants circle each other
the prince is nimble
the prince is quick
he thrusts the spear again and again driving hellboy into a display case full of antique weapons
the glass breaks and a number of swords and axes fall to the floor
to hellboy arm yourself
use the flail
not my style
watch and learn fish bowl
he punches the prince hard
the blow knocks the prince to his knees as he rises hellboy connects with a brutal combination
in the arms of the troll the princess head rockets back and forth as if struck
a moan of pain escapes from her lips
seeing this h
stop you mustnt harm him
as the prince totters hellboy turns to look at abe momentarily distracted then hellboy grimaces and looks down the princes spear tip is half buried in his chest
the prince sneers and gives the spear a savage yank breaking off the blade
hellboys eyes roll upward liz screams
she and johann manage to catch hellboy as he collapses
the prince reclaims the princess and turns to the humans
his eyes seek out abe who has rushed to hellboys side
showing off the princess if you want to see her again youll give me whats rightfully mine
many people died for that crown
bring it to me
he and his trolls escape into the night
stretched out on an operating table hb is barely conscious
abe in surgical goggles probes the wound
in close up abes webbed fingers lightly touch the glinting metal that protrudes from hellboys sternum
the spear tip responds as if alive it wriggles producing a groan from liz is near panic
abe stop studying
pull the friggin thing out why dont you
liz im sorry
its a magical alloy
every time i touch it it moves closer to his heart
come here ill show you
liz backs away shaking her head
i dont want to see it
to johann weve got to do something
i cannot reverse the magic we have to look for the prince or somebody that can help red
go after that son of a bitch and get him to reverse the spell
hell demand the gold piece so
we find it
we give it to him
manning exchanges a worried look with a couple of his agents in the b
liz rummages in the princess quarters throwing bedding around opening drawers
liz bursts into the conference room and starts shoving books and papers aside hunting high and low
johann walks into the control room
in every screen a crisis situation is visible
jagged blurry footage shows a yeti at large in nebraska and a plesiosaurus at large in scotland etc etc a lupgarou loose in picadilly a winged creature nesting in a
skyscraper we have a situation in almost every point of the map
johann looks back at a map with led indicators signaling each crisis in the globe
they keep turning on a dozen a second
the rebellions spreading too fast the only way to stop it is to stop the prince
abe enters the dark soaking library and surveys the ruins of his tank
he goes directly to one of the book stands which lies in pieces on the floor
he comes up with his copy of jane eyre
he opens it to chapter and finds the gold piece
liz has come in behind him
abe quickly palms the precious thing in his webbed hand
it doesnt matter
forget the gold piece
lets us just find this royal asshole
fire and water me and you abe
well kick his ass
abe looks supremely troubled
abe lets do this for red
abe nods unable to find a good answer
he manages to tuck the gold piece into his belt
abe stands at a lectern
behind him a projected image of the princess map from the troll market
his finger traces the strange elvish text
the map contained within the cylinder seems useless now the case itself proves very useful he moistens the holding cylinder case on a rubber stamp mat and imprints the surface
pattern on the paper map
glyphs and coordinates become visible
a silhouette of a twisted gnarly tree is visible too
renvyle it is both the princess and her brother were born there
they hold it sacred
even if youre right we sit tight and locate the gold piece make sure he never ever gets his hands on it
if theres any truth to this legend the fate of the world depends on it
what about red
dont you care about him
a moment of silence
nobody knows what to say
that may be his destiny
manning is right we cant take the chance
liz glares at him
red was right about you
welcome to the team johann
she leaves the room
hellboy leans weakly against the doorway to his room
his cats purr all around him oblivious to his pain
he sits by the bed
liz enters the room
he smiles weakly at her dont worry sparky its all going to be abe stands nearby in silence
liz looks at him teary eyed
well make it alright
screw manning you are right liz we should just do this together the three of us
the bprd airplane sits quietly in its hangar
in the passenger compartment hellboy climbs up
he looks up to see liz smiling down at him
abes sitting in the pilots seat leafing through the massive airplane manual
engine starting refer to na bd
liz climbs in behind him
we stay here much longer were gonna get caught
just a few more minutes
heres an easy way to remember that port means left
they each have four a noise from the door its johann
good evening friends
dont try to stop us johann
on the contrary
ive been giving it some thought and we should be able to save hellboy
after all the prince lacks the gold crown
without it his army poses no threat
none at all
abe is very quiet
in despair its useless i i cant i cant pilot this thing
johann sits down in the co pilot seat and melds with the controls
ill give it a try abe smiles at the sound of the engines starting up
manning bangs on a vending machine in one of the bprd corridors
as a dribble of hot coffee splatters into his cup a couple of agents run up
sir youd better come fast got it ow
he burns his fingers on the coffee as he hurries after the agents
the bprd airplane is roaring amid clouds of exhaust fumes
the plane spins around and around in tight circles its wing tips knocking into ladders lights and shelves
a bunch of agents are cowering in the doorway as manning arrives
not all of them its not possible
isnt that johann at the controls
sure enough they get a glimpse of the transparent head through the cockpit window
abes there too
he raises a webbed hand to wave goodbye
the plane taxis outside onto the runway
and takes off barely under control just missing the new jersey treetops
the prince pulls the princess through fractured roaring tunnels
here and there the walls are pierced allowing light and ocean waves to enter
rounding a few corners the prince stops near a wall decorated with a large elaborate fresco
it shows a stylized family tree hunting scenes and naive renderings of trolls faeries and ogres
maybe this will help you remember who we are who you are
what our destiny is the prince pushes his sister through a low doorway out onto overlooking a vast cavern big as a stadium lit by a thousand torches
the mechanical army stands knee deep in heaving seawater and foam
they they will be mine to command whether you like it or not
only after our victory will you appreciate my sacrifice
the bprd plane exits a bank of clouds and starts its descent upon an irish island surrounded by the atlantic ocean
massive granite mountains encircle an impossibly green valley
early sunlight washes over hellboys body who weakly groans in lizs arms
to liz where are we liz
near the ocean red
weregonna make you well here
the back doors of the cargo plane opens and out come abe and liz and abe help hellboy up to a gnarled tree twisted by eons of wind
abe unfurls the map and points at a drawing of a similar weird tree
this should be the portal
by all rights johann reaches the tree and inspects it carefully
abe bring the mapcase over here
hes found a roundish slot in the tree where the lowest branch joins the trunk
abe slips the map back into its crystal cylinder and holds it alongside it looks to be a perfect fit
try it abe before you do anything
remember what were in for
a world unlike anything weve ever known
youre wasting time
abe inserts and twists the cylinder
the tree comes to life hauling its roots out of the ground bending them into a swaying arch
and hard to leave
they walk under the tree roots into
a transformed landscape
a perpetual nightland still overlooking the same ocean but now throbbing with pale colors and twisted rackahm esque contours
the men start down the hill into a valley bordered by a rugged coastline
the team reaches the stony shore of a mile wide inlet
abe brings out the map
pointing to the opposite shore renvyle is over there
they glance up and down the beach looking for a boat
hellboy blinks and sniffs the air
a goblin speaks up from an outcropping of rocks in the shallows directly in front of them
by his side sitting atop of a tree a satyr and a crow observe the group
i bid you welcome strangers
would you be seeking safe passage to renvyle
can you help us
im sure you can come to an understanding
the goblin heaves on an oar and emerges from behind the rocks
hes standing in the stern of a sturdy little coracle
its wooden hull is painted in celtic patterns
room enough for all of you
looks at hellboy even your weary friend
what will it cost boatman
the goblin smiles displaying a disconcerting row of triangular teeth
ah next to nothing
make me an offer
abe johann and liz confer among themselves how much
he wont want money
to the goblin i have a
johann removes his equipment belt dangling it in front the creatures bat like face
i have no use for such a thing
liz shows him her binoculars
is a wonderful set of eyes magic eyes that will bring the world i already have binoculars
no i see something special
he points toward hellboys chest
under his bandage
quick as a squirrel the creature hops to hellboys side and brings out a knife
in one sweep of the blade he reveals hbs terrible wound and the speartip protruding from it
points at the steel that in exchange for your crossing
dont you touch it
she rushes to hellboys side pushing the goblin back ready for a fight
the goblin shrugs
is it so precious to you
let me pull it out
one touch can kill him
the goblins eyes grow wide with understanding
we must go to the angel of hell know what to do
the tiny boat is a dot on the golden waves of the inlet as the goblin rows them to the opposite shore and docks near a cove
the goblin leads the way as liz abe and johann arrive and help hellboy up
strange birds hang upside down form the caves roof
a massive chimney has been carved out of the caves rock at the other end
a black ancient figure is hunched there warming its skeletal hands by the fire
a raspy voice utters something in an ancient language
the goblin replies gesturing at hellboy who collapses on the floor
in a deep coma hellboy lies on the floor near the crackling fireplace
the angel of death extends its four black wings and a thin jagged smile appears in its pale eyeless face
the boy i remember him well
anung un rama
oh my god
i helped bring him into this world in my fashion
it pulls a set of a glowing red hot tongs out of the fire
it studies the speartip which has buried itself deep in hellboys flesh
i warn you it is his destiny to rule over the destruction of the earth
not now not tomorrow but some day
you are sure you want him to live
yes i say yes
abe and johann exchange a silent worried look
very well then but let it be said the day will come when you will pay the price fire girl this will bring you and the world much sorrow
and ill deal with it when that time comes
now save him
the creature cackles and then grips the spear tip with the tongs
a cry of pain from hellboy as it withdraws the bloody point from his chest
the angel of death holds up the speartip and looks at it with distaste
looking at hellboy see
hellboys eyes flutter open
to hellboy sleep now child
your strength it will return
a guttural hiss from the corner the goblin is jumping up and down pointing at the speartip
our ferry captain he wants his payment
ach outside with you
she tosses the speartip to the creature who scoops it up and bounds out the door
instantly the goblins and birds leap down and crowd around him chattering in excitement over the latest prize
she gazes down at hellboy whose yellow eyes are fixed on her
he smiles wanly
alone on a hilltop abe surveys the coastline
through the binoculars he discerns a second cave half hidden behind wild breaking waves
glancing back at angel of deaths cave johann strikes off on his own headed for the cave
outside angel of deaths hut a bandaged hb is sitting up blinking in the sunlight
he sips some tea and gazes at liz who is happy now
i almost lost you hellboy smiles and grabs her hand i thought you were mad at me
well no one can stay mad forever
im sorry for all the attention i thought it would be good for us
were never going to make them all happy red
what we have is ours and no one i can turn my back on the world
i dont care anymore i dont as long as you stay with me as long as you think im still a good man
am i a good man liz
yes you are
you are the best man ive ever met
you still seem sad
is there anything you want to tell me
yes there is say it now then
whatever it is im ready
is it about johann no no what are you talking about
before she can go on johann appears
he carries a poultice and fresh rags
abe and i have found the entrance to the golden armys resting place liz come with us looks at hellboy you should stay behind and get some rest and call
you in the morning right
like hell i will
im keeping an eye on you johann liz and hellboy follow a rugged trail along a bluff high over the sea
johann refers to the map then points to the cave opening a half mile ahead
abe is standing there there
abe points at the violent sea below the only way in im afraid well have to jump in looks at hellboy can you make it
if this is the entrance i know why isnt there more security
with a roar wink
jumps out and throws a chain around bellboys neck
the chain is connected to his iron mace which now dangles around hellboys neck
the two creatures battle each other fiercely
winks mace destroys a nearby tree like a wrecking ball and it connects twice with hellboys head
but red gets the upper hand quickly snapping the chain in two and twirling the mace like a boleador
he hits wink again and again see
hellboy grips the chain pulls the creature close then like a weightlifter raises him high overhead
with a mighty grunt hellboy tosses him overboard
wink hits the jagged rocks once twice thrice ouch ouch ouch looking around we better go swimming before any more ugly fellas show up he stares down into the swirling
waters and discreetly takes his hand to his bandaged side hes bleeding
the wound has re opened
red are you
dont say a word blue lets move on johann plunges in from above his body quickly tumbled by the rough seas
a moment later liz and hellboy are in the water too
johann swims down leading them into the darkness of the cave entrance
as they bob up for air they find theres only a few inches of breathing room between the sea and the rocky ceiling
liz starts coughing
hang on people
ill be right back
johann dives down to find a rusting iron lock six feet under the surface
he tries to turn the control wheel but cant make it budge
seconds later hellboy is at his side gripping the wheel in his huge hands
using all his strength hellboy finally manages to turn it
his bandage however floats free
and his wound opens up emitting a plume of blood
lungs bursting he shoots to the surface
johann stays behind and swings open the lock revealing
carved from the living rock leading upward into the depths of the cliff
the trio cautiously climbs the stairs finding their way with light sticks
hellboy stops to lean against the wall
he dabs at his chest with a rag
to johann hold up
we need to rest
im fine i tell ya
he lurches forward pushing past the others fighting off his pain
to johann this was a mistake
hes mein gott the stairs lead to a vast underground arena where a thousand torches are flickering
camera pulls back to reveal rank upon rank of golden soldiers
hellboy leads the way down a row of gleaming statues pausing to gaze up at the blank face of one of the infantrymen
you got some gum
two rows away johann examines the lethal weaponry that terminates the arms of each soldier
a versatile highly mobile killing machine
make that machines johann
i see more than one
hellboy taps on a soldiers mechanical chest which booms faintly sending echoes up into the dark cavern
you hear that
listen he thumps it harder
the mechanical thing rocks backwards
the thing falls onto the soldier behind it
then the ear shattering noise of a hundred car wrecks builds as a toppling line of soldiers races away like falling dominoes
the sound dwindles then builds again as another line of falling soldiers bears down on them
liz screams and hellboy pulls her aside
the soldiers crash past them until the din suddenly stops
the prince stands revealed at the head of the column
as a boy they say i enjoyed toy soldiers
so do you i see
he strolls past the mechanical figures pausing to kick aside some of the weapons
to hellboy youre bleeding
hellboy wipes at his oozing chest wound
now its your turn
do you envy these contraptions
they never bleed
they feel nothing
not even the zest of combat
the prince circles them keeping an eye on johann
these fighting men are the very model of patience
merely awaiting word from their lawful commander
from his tunic he brings forth two of the gold segments
he fits them together
you have the remaining piece i presume
we do not then you are most foolish
he gestures to some troll guards near a tunnel entrance
they lead the princess out in chains
you came here expecting what
the death you would unleash will never happen
what you need is far from here and will stay out of your reach forever
a voice reaches their ears from the tunnel entrance behind them
stop i have it
abe dripping wet stands there the last gold segment in the palm of his hand
oh my god
what has he done
keeping his eyes on the princess abe gives the gold piece to the prince
hellboy steps forward feeling dizzy and betrayed
abe to hellboy you cannot fight him not without hurting her
what would you do if it was liz
the prince fits the gold parts together and places the resulting crown on his head
i am prince nuada and i command my army to life once more
does anyone dispute my right
with the deep sound of gears ratchets and springs the army comes to life
up comes the lances and shields
points at the team kill them
abe is now aghast seeing the prince drag his sister back
to the prince that was your price
a ransom you said paid in good faith
abe continued to hellboy why he lied to us
abe old buddy
if we survive this we need to talk
the army swings into action marching toward them
the four friends retreat soon pressed against one of the walls
he hes a cad
can you imagine a highborn heir to the throne last in a noble line of not now abe okay
the first phalanx of golden soldiers is upon them their terrifying weapons slashing in unison
hellboy brings out his huge gun and starts firing as johann grabs a torch and swings it like a club
a couple of the mechanical soldiers go down only to pop back onto their feet new weapons blossoming on their arms
let me liz summons up a white hot burst of electrical fire in each hand
with a yell she unleashes a searing explosion at the oncoming fighters
the shock wave rolls through the enemy ranks flattening scores of soldiers
for a moment the bprd team regains hope
but the endless lines of mechanicals keep coming marching on and over their scorched comrades
hellboy holsters the samaritan and rushes forward giving it his best
his wound is running with fresh blood
he punches a soldier whose mace pounds repeatedly against his ravaged chest as blood spatters his face hellboy groans and keeps fighting to absolutely no effect
at length the mechanical arms throw hellboy against the wall where he collapses unable to carry on
so the only one thing may stop them johann unzips his suit with a hisss his ectoplasmic self flows out into the body of the nearest mechanical soldier
instantly the thing whirls on its companions and starts chopping
bits and pieces of gold machinery fly about as johann rips into the enemy
but again fresh metal soldiers fill in for the fallen
as the bprd team watches in dismay johanns mechanical shell is surrounded by the other soldiers who methodically dismember it like marauding insects
as the parts drop to the floor twitching and useless johann slithers out and re inhabits his suit
they are too many
anyone have another idea
hellboy grabs the nearest sword and hauls himself to his feet
a bellow prince nuada i challenge your right to command this army
with a soft boom the clockwork troops come to a halt
all the mechanical heads turn toward the prince who stands on a ledge with his sister
follows hb no please no hellboy moves away from him
a challenge must be answered
raise your sword
a challenge from you
you are no one
he is anung un rma son of the fallen one he has the right
her eyes lock with abes theres no other way
the prince sees hellboy coming and with a bitter smile picks up his sword
to the bprd team may his fate show you the cost of pride and blindness
as the hall rings with their first blows of their swords hellboys too weak summoning up his last ounce of strength hellboy manages to drive the prince back into the
center of the arena where they fight under the inscrutable gaze of the golden army
every time hellboy gets a clean shot at the prince abe looks at him pleading and hb has no choice but to keep parrying off his enemy
hellboys sword grows heavy in his hands he stares at it in dismay as it trembles
his muscles can no longer respond
the prince is ready to kill him
witness to a nightmare no
a sudden movement at the ledge where the princess steps forward and
using her concealed dagger she stabs herself in the right arm
in silent slow motion she drops the dagger
instantly the prince drops his arm
his hands come away red with blood
he looks over at his sister
they share a hard look of mutual understanding
love and hatred
hellboy raises through supreme effort bleeding
he quickly raises his sword
the fight resumes but this time hb has the advantage
he fights bravely and after parrying fiercely with the prince he disarms him and points his sword at his chest
i have won no
you have not he impales himself on hellboys sword
the blade goes through his abdomen and protrudes on the other side
hellboy pulls it out but its too late
both the prince and the princess collapse to the ground mortally wounded
abe hurries to the princess
takes her into his arms blinking in despair
the pale young creature is now a ghostly white
she lifts her eyes to abes caressing his thin scaly face
well find each other again somewhere
and she dies in his arms
in the center of the arena to hellboy you
think youre any different from me
the humans they will tire of you
they will disappoint you
and in the end they will betray you
are living a lie
your time will come again
may you make a better choice
then he too is dead
both him and his sister turn to fine pale dust
and the wind carries away the ashes from abes hands
shaken hellboy lifts the crown from the princes head
looks at it carefully as if considering the possibilities
suddenly he rips it into pieces
as he crushes the first segement
an entire division of the golden army collapses into a heap of scrap metal
hellboy does the same with a second section of the crown and another massive division of the army tumbles into junk
hb is about the tear up the last segment of the crown when it explodes in his hands
the last of the army disintegrates
hellboy confronts the princes frightened troll guards to the trolls you and your kind
and stay in the shadows where you belong
as the ogres slink back into the tunnels liz looks at hellboy
he seems angry stung by the princes last words
the bprd team crosses waterfalls and stone bridges through the magical hills
liz walks at hellboys side but he avoids her glance
they reach the strange twisted tree
johann takes the map cylinder and fits it into the slot
any last minute requests
very quiet do it please
i im ready for the real world now
johann turns the cylinder
the tree roots form their arch
and the bprd team walks through
on the other side of the tree manning and a bunch of agents have set up spotter scopes and are gazing out over the countryside looking for them
suddenly the team appears literally from out of nowhere
whered you come from
we were just i know here to help
well i appreciate that manning
abe steps past hellboy and removes his gunbelt and equipment pack
i want to thank you too
for all youve done for us over the years
he gives his stuff to the astonished agent
what exactly is this
walking away i quit
hellboy glances at abe then hauls out the samaritan and shrugs off his pack too
looks that way doesnt it
hellboy starts to leave but spins around and takes his gun back
i think ill keep this
he finally meets lizs gaze
she crosses to him and takes him by the arm
she walks off with hellboy and abe clinging tightly to the big red daemon
liz not you too
to johann they cant do this
stop them johann manning youre an asshole
miles down the road abe stands on a promontory staring off at the ocean which blazes with golden reflections
liz and hb sit next to each other on some mossy rocks
overhead blue sky puffy white clouds
what you said before about us living i mean it
course im thinking usa
but hey you decide
breathing deep lets find a place in the country
clean air green hills fresh milk from the farm
with lots of room to grow in
he looks blank grow
who gonna grow
our baby thats who
on hellboys immense grin freeze frame
at the end of the credits zinco enterprises helicopters land on the hard icy surface of amundsens glacier
a row of guards in black garb flank each helicopter
out of one of them exits roderick zinco billionare madman
he carries a mechanized container a little larger than a hat box
camera follows as he enters through a crevace and
light shines through the ice walls and into rows and rows of machinery
