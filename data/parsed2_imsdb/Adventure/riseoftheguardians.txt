written by david lindsay abaire screening script darkness
thats the first thing i remember
it was dark and it was cold
and i was scared
the silhouette of a body appears as it drifts into a ray of light refracted through water which turns into
the moonlight intensifies almost magically and the ice above begins to spider web and crack
snow covered trees in every direction
the ice in the pond continues to crack until finally a hole splinters open
a young man floats out of the water bathed in the intense moonlight
this is jack frost thin pale barefoot his tousled hair frosted white
then i saw the moon
it was so big and it was so bright and it seemed to chase the darkness away
and when it did
i wasnt scared anymore
jack floats back down onto the ice as the hole closes up underneath him
why i was there and what i was meant to do that ive never known
and a part of me wonders if i ever will
jack looks around confused then turns toward the moonlight as it dims a bit
jack carefully treads across the ice until he hits something with his feet
he looks down and at his feet is a wooden staff
curious he picks it up
almost immediately the staff begins to glow a cold blue in his hands
guardians screening script avid
jack almost drops it as the base of the staff comes in contact with the ground
frost shoots out and spreads across the ice
jack is visibly confused
he touches a few trees with his staff sending frost up their trunks
then he swings the staff again more confident as he begins to run across the frozen pond
another swing and a gust of wind swirls him high up into the air
jack floats for a moment only to fall back down to earth and into the trees
jack grabs hold of a tree branch and pulls himself up to see a small town off in the distance
a collection of simple timber houses with thatched roofs
jack comes in for a landing and its a rocky one
he stands up still elated and brushes himself off
as jack makes his way into town settlers are warming their hands by campfire
jack doesnt recognize anyone
to the townsfolk hello
good evening maam
the settlers walk past jack not noticing him
jack crouches down as a young boy runs toward him
oh ah excuse me can you tell me where i am
the boy runs right through jack as if he were a ghost
jack staggers back in shock
hes speechless as if the wind had been knocked out him
his emotions causing it to snow
townsfolk continue to pass through jack unaware of his presence
shaken jack turns and retreats into the forest
my name is jack frost how do i know that
the moon told me so
but that was all he ever told me
and that was a long long time ago
guardians screening script avid
we pan up as the moon shines down over the snow covered trees
fiery gypsy violin music as we move through clouds to reveal a massive ice canyon and just around a bend the incredible hidden fortress of north aka santa claus
we glimpse a familiar looking red jacket and cap with white trim on a coat hanger just as a pair of tongs slam a block of ice onto a stone
work table in quick cuts a chainsaw shears the block in half spraying ice
north lifts up the chainsaw revealing a massive tatoo on his arm the word naughty clearly visible
three elves huddle in a doorway around a plate of cookies each licking their own tasty morsel
still waiting for cookies
as north crosses the background the elves lower the cookies from their mouths their faces frozen in fear
the elves duck out of the way as north launches himself across the floor on his rolling chair close as his huge hand gropes furiously among his work tools finally
grabbing a miniature hammer
as norths humming along with his music delicately chiseling into the ice we see a second arm sleeve tatoo the word nice clearly visible his intense blue eye magnified in
a jewelers eyepiece a delicate sculpting tool cuts fine details into the ice his hands place the finished piece on a curving ice track an ice locomotive
it belches ice vapor and chugs down the track picking up speed yes
norths hand grabs a cookie from a plate held up by the two elves
guardians screening script avid
one of the elves gives his cohort a look and points to the plate as it chews with a mouth full of food to which it then unfurls its tongue
and lets the half eaten morsels spill out onto the plate
he takes a bite and leans toward the ice track
he chuckles as the train hits a loop and launches off a ramp into midair then wings unfold jet engines sprout and ignite and the train lifts off the track
suddenly the door is thrown open by one of norths concerned yetis sending the flying ice locomotive skidding across the floor in pieces
the yeti cries out covering his mouth in shame
north cries out devastated
the yeti equally emotional lets out another whimper
north looks down at the broken toy and takes a moment to collect himself
how many times have i told you to knock
north leaps up draws a huge scimitar from its sheath and a sea of tiny bells on the heads of panicking elves part as norths huge boots stomp through
shoo with your pointy heads
why are you always under boot
he pushes his way past a couple of his yeti workers theyre looking up in fear at guardians screening script avid
covered with lights blanketing the continents
but north notices that all at once hundreds of lights suddenly go out
what is this
now more lights in greater numbers as if something is snuffing them out by the thousands
norths concern grows
have you checked the axis
is rotation balanced
before the yeti can finish a wind whips up from out of nowhere north stares in outrage as a blanket of swirling black sand crawls over the lights and shrouds
the entire globe in inky darkness the elves scurry in a panic then all at once the black sand whooshes up off the globe rushes up through the ceiling as the remaining sand bursts into a puff of smoke and dissipates into the air as the wind dies the scattered pieces of debris settle to the ground and the globes lights come back on north whirls to see a huge shadow flash across the floors and curving walls of his fortress
it quickly disappears leaving nothing but the distant echo of
north is frozen looking up into the darkness gravely can it be
then calls off dingle
a group of elves step forward gleefully pointing to themselves as if theyre all dingle
the excitement quickly turns to confusion
we are going to have company
north reaches out for a large emergency lever twists and guardians screening script avid
the globe pulses with energy which lights up and zooms up the axis shaft toward the roof from the tallest spire of norths fortress northern light energy radiates outward for
the first time in decades the a little fairy carrying a coin flies above the head of a sleeping child
she quickly ducks under the pillow and comes out the other side with a tooth in hand
hundreds of fairies fly toward a hollowed out mountain this is tooths palace and its a majestic site
dozens of tiny fairies flit about
teeth are filed away in tiny wooden drawers
coins are handed out
chicago sector molars bicuspids central incisors
moscow sector incisors premolars uh oh heavy rain advisory
des moines weve got a cuspid at maple
a hive of activity and at the center a winged figure barks out orders like a harried air traffic controller
this is tooth
a mini tooth fairy flies up to tooth as thousands of tiny mini tooth fairies continue their work behind them
and suddenly everything stops
tooth whips around and we finally see her beautiful face
guardians screening script avid
shes holding up a little tooth and gazing at it with dreamy adoration
the surrounding fairies tweet with excitement
its her first tooth
have you ever seen a more adorable lateral incisor in all of your life
look how she flossed
the fairies tweets turn to concern turning tooths attention to norths aurora signal stretching across the sky
she gasps and flies off like a rocket toward the source of the signal accompanied by a few of her ranking fairies
my fellow guardians it is our job to watch over the children of the world and keep them safe to bring wonder hope and dreams
and so ive called us all here for one reason and one reason only the children are in danger
much of this we hear over the following
we pull out from the face of a sleeping child to reveal a stream of sand swirling overhead
its a dream and its taken the shape of a child playing soccer
we follow the dreamsand stream out his window and up into the sky where we see dozens of strands of sand descending to earth
keep following up through majestic clouds
to reveal a small glowing golden cloud of dreamsand shimmering among the clouds trailing the golden threads
the strands are being controlled by a small portly figure the sandman
suddenly norths emergency signal zips by
the sandman turns to look and his eyes narrow visibly concerned
sandy closes his eyes and in an instant the dreamsand cloud suddenly swirls around him changing form into a small biplane with sandy in the cockpit
he barrel rolls the plane into a dizzying dive through the spectacular cloudscape and flies off into the distance
guardians screening script avid
an enemy we have kept at bay for centuries has finally decided to strike back
we alone can stop him
much of this we hear over the following
a few easter eggs pop up out of the ground their little legs carry them out of the way of a fast approaching object
speeding along through a subterranean tunnel we can barely keep up with a dimly lit figure as it races at blinding speed leaping and zigzagging through a series of tunnels
a hole opens in the snow and a pair of rabbit ears pops out
a huge rabbit climbs out and brushes off the snow annoyed
the six foot tall figure is bunnymund
ah its freezing
he shivers with cold then goes slogging through the snow
i cant feel my feet
i cant feel my feet
in the distance is norths ornately decorated and dimly lit palace built into the side of a mountain of ice
sandys biplane circles the massive chamber leaving trails of dreamsand
oh this better be good north
guardians screening script avid
to her fairies montreal sector six ten premolars eight incisors and twelve canines
steer clear of the wild goose migration
sandy thank you for coming
sandy descends from the plane and floats to the ground
he joins north bunny and tooth as they walk through the globe room
sand glyphs appear above sandys head communicating that he is busy and has a lot of work to do
i know i know but i obviously wouldnt have called you all here unless it was serious
north bunny tooth and sandy reach the center of the room
tooth does her best to shush her mini fairies
the boogie man was here at the pole
north points to the globe
the other guardians turn to look
there was black sand covering the globe
what do you mean black sand
and then a shadow
hold on hold on i thought you said you saw pitch
well ah not exactly
guardians screening script avid
can you believe this guy
bunny turns to sandy who shrugs while forming a dreamsand question mark above his head
yeah you said it sandy
bunny goes back to painting one of his easter eggs
look he is up to something very bad
i feel it in my belly
his eyes narrow hang on hang on you mean to say you summoned me here three days before easter because of your belly
mate if i did this to you three days before christmas to her fairies argentina
a batch of bicuspids in buenos aires
easter is not christmas
here we go
north grabs bunnys painted egg casually juggling it in his hand as he walks off
meanwhile sandy who is being served eggnog by a yeti suddenly notices something high above
north i i dont have time for this
ive still got two million eggs to finish up
the moon rises into view high up in the ceiling its rays of light begin to shine brightly through as they cascade down the walls of the globe room
no matter how much you paint is still egg
guardians screening script avid
sandy points to the moon unsuccessfully to get the others attention
look mate im dealing with perishables
youve got all year to prepare
to her fairies pittsburg boy eight two molars
sandy puts his fingers in his mouth to whistle a silent musical note forming above his head
why are rabbits always so nervous
and why are you always such a blowhard
to her fairies ontario sector nine five canines two molars and fourteen incisors
is that all in one house
sandy waves a sand flag above his head pointing and jumping up and down as the moonlight continues to fill the room
turning his attention tooth
cant you see were trying to argue
sorry not all of us get to work one night a year
am i right sandy
sandy tries to signal with a golden arrow pointing toward the ceiling but to no avail as the others continue their bickering
sandy thinks tooth has noticed for a split second but then to her fairies san diego sector two
five incisors a bicuspid and a really loose molar on stand by
guardians screening script avid
come on mate pitch went out with the dark ages
we made sure of that remember
i know it was him
we have serious situation
well ive got a serious situation with some eggs
hey i hate to interrupt the we work so hard once a year club but could we concentrate on the matter sandy cant take it anymore grabs an elf by
his hat and vigorously shakes its bell
the other guardians are finally silenced and all turn to look at sandy who points up a sand crescent moon forming above his head
the dizzy elf staggers away
finally the others turn to see the shaft of moonlight as it concentrates on the circle between them
man in moon
sandy why didnt you say something
sandy gives him a deadpan stare dreamsand smoke shoots out his ears
to man in moon its been a long time old friend
what is big news
everyone looks to the center of the intense spot of moonlight the light ebbs away leaving a dark spot which resolves into the shadowed silhouette of pitch
the guardians look on stunned
it is pitch
north pats his belly and gives bunny a look
back up to the moon manny
what must we do
guardians screening script avid
in answer the shadow of pitch disappears and the circle of moonlight intensifies and shrinks concentrating further illuminating an ornate symbol on the floor at the center of their circle
the symbol rises out of the ground revealing a large gem at the head of a pillar
ah guys you know what this means
the moons light suddenly refracts through the gem casting light all over the chamber
hes choosing a new guardian
must be big deal
manny thinks we need help
since when do we need help
i wonder who its gonna be
a dreamsand four leaf clover forms above sandys head
maybe the leprechaun
please not the groundhog please not the groundhog
then a bright flash a rush of wind and a figure resolves over the central pillar slight hooded bearing a familiar hooked staff
the mini teeth all sigh and swoon as the guardians stand there stunned
ah i take it back
the groundhogs fine
guardians screening script avid
caught admiring jack well ah as long he helps to ah
to protect the children right
he doesnt care about children
all he does is freeze water pipes and mess with my egg hunts
hes an irresponsible selfish
this stops bunnymund in his tracks
jack frost is many things but he is not a guardian
as we turn toward the face of the hooded figure
a hooded figure with a familiar looking staff rests atop a post office box on the opposite end of the street
the man touches the staff to the ground sending a streak of frost across the street
a russian boy approaches a water fountain turns the handle and moves in for a sip
but as he does the water freezes magically and the boys tongue is stuck to the frozen water
his friends cant help but laugh
tongue stuck to frozen aahhhhh
a mail man walks across the street and a patch of ice magically appears under his feet
he scrambles and boom
lands on his butt
just behind the man we see the trail of frost climb up the side of a building
we stay on the frost as it moves up along a rain pipe and through the windows we see
guardians screening script avid
a boy try to feed his gold fish but a layer of ice suddenly forms along the water surface and prevents the fish from reaching its food
we move along the side of the building
a writer in his study sits next to stacks of papers
the window suddenly swings open and a gust of wind sends the pages flying out the window
we move along the building across clothes lines and power lines as they freeze
we continue to move up and finally discover the culprit
jack frost makes his way atop a cathedral spire and takes in the view the full moon bathes the city in moonlight
ah now that that was fun
jack chuckles as he calls the wind
the trees begin to sway and leaves fly into the air
jack grabs hold of the spire smiling as the wind blows past
take me home
jack lets go and the wind carries him into the air and through the clouds
night turns to day as jack flies from one horizon to the other
jack falls through the clouds smiling toward the town of burgess
jack continues on down and zooms through the streets
pedestrians clench their jackets and reach for their hats as gusts of wind snow and streaks of frost are left in jacks wake
jack flies in and with the wind behind him skates across an all too familiar pond
as the wind zips across the pond it knocks a book out of the hands of a little boy walking alone this is jamie
guardians screening script avid
jamie goes to pick up the book and we get a glimpse of the cover theyre out there
mysteries mythical creatures and the unexplained phenomena
jack flies into frame and lands beside jamie
huh that looks interesting
suddenly twins claude and caleb come barreling past them rough housing and laughing as they slam each other into drifts all the boys are
jack calls after the boys
goes running after them hey guys wait up
are you guys coming to the egg hunt sunday
yeah free candy
i hope we can find the eggs with all this snow
caleb stuffs a handful of snow down his brothers jacket the kids arrive at the fence of jamies house
jamie opens up a secret plank and heads into his yard
claude and caleb are still messing with each other
meanwhile jack walks unseen along the top of the fence
no you stop
guardians screening script avid
whoa it says here that they found big foot hair samples and dna in michigan
thats like super close
here we go again
jamie arrives at his front gate sled in hand while sophie jamies year old sister in fairy wings sits down on their greyhound as it lies in the yard
you saw the video too claude hes out there
thats what you said about aliens
and the easter bunny
grabs his sled wow the easter bunny is real
oh hes real alright
real annoying real grumpy and really full of himself
jack hops off the fence and walks amongst the kids peering over their shoulders as they play in the yard
come on you guys believe anything
sophie begins to cry
sophie fell again
jamies mom comes outside
caleb alongside his brother stands at the front gate and calls out to jamie
guardians screening script avid
you okay soph

we dont want jack frost nipping at your nose
jamies mom plunks the hat on his head tweaks his nose
whos jack frost
no one honey
its just an expression
smile drops offended hey
jack jumps down from the fence as the boys head off
whos jack frost
jack reaches down and grabs a hand full of snow from off the ground
with his palm open jack uses his magic to form the perfect snowball
he then puckers his lips and blows onto it with his icy breath
the snowball turns a light shade of blue
theres something going on here
the snowball goes flying through the air and boof
the snowball hits jamie smack in the back of the head
jamie looks up peeved and turns
then we watch as his face changes
a mischievous sparkle comes into his eyes
a big smile
make no mistake something magical has just happened
okay who threw that
jack flies in and lands amongst the group of kids
guardians screening script avid
well wasnt bigfoot kiddo
jamie scans the horizon for the culprit
his eyes land on a couple kids making snow barricades
monty oddball with big glasses with his back turned suddenly gets a snowball to the back of the head knocking him face first into the ground
pippa brainy pigtails pink hat steps forward and boof
a magical snowball from jack hits her knocking her back
pippas face changes a mischievous sparkle
you struck first
suddenly we see caleb struck in the side of the head with one of jacks snowballs claude cant help but laugh
free for all
and just like that we find ourselves in a take no prisoners snowball fight the kids pummeling each other mercilessly
alright who needs ammo
jack supplies the kids with more snowballs
the kids are loving this
look at that
the mayhem continues as jamie using his sled as a shield is knocked backward into a snowman crushing it underneath him
a snowball flies overhead and hits cupcake a tough third grader as wide as she is tall in the back of the head
dread sets in amongst the other kids cupcake squints gunslinger eyes
guardians screening script avid
crud i hit cupcake
she hit cupcake
you hit cupcake
jamie is flat on his back terrified
he looks up to see cupcake standing over him
jack hits cupcake with a magical snowball
the kids gasp in horror
did you throw that
a moment and then cupcake starts laughing as jacks magic takes hold
cupcake chases the kids down the hill holding the head of her snowman in her hands
jack all the while runs along side taking pleasure in the excitement
hey come on
you cant catch me
ooh little slippery
jack jumps ahead blasting a sheet of ice behind him
the kids fall to the ground except for jamie who lands on his sled and slides head first down the sheet of ice into town
guardians screening script avid
jamie watch out
thats the street
what are you doing
jamie suddenly shoots out between the trees and careens past a set of parked cars
jacks path of ice covers the street
as jamie turns his speed only escalates sending him directly into traffic
jamie barely misses a moving truck spinning it out of control sending furniture out the back and causing a four car pile up
whoa dont worry kid i gotcha
jamie looks back then quickly ahead as terror comes into his eyes
jack cant help but smile
its gonna be alright
no no no no
keep up with me kid
take a left
jamie rockets through a pedestrian intersection narrowly missing those in the crosswalk
hey slow down
whoa no no no no
jack flies over to the far side of the street sending the streak of ice and jamie up onto the sidewalk
guardians screening script avid
is that jamie bennett
whoa whoa whoa whoa
there you go
look at that dude
jamie flies off the sidewalk and back into the middle of the street almost knocking over a postman
as jack flies by jamies side he sees the look of excitement come into jamies face
jack smiles knowing hes responsible
jack sees an oncoming snowplow and quickly jumps ahead carried by the wind to divert the ice trail
jamies sled suddenly turns narrowly missing the oncoming truck and barrels toward jacks newly formed ice ramp
jamie closes his eyes as the ramp launches jamie over the street high into the air and toward the statue of thaddeus burgess colonial settler
jamies friends stand in awe mouths wide open as he sails through the air
jamie opens his eyes and the look of fear suddenly turns to joy
jack looks on smiling
jamie lands safely in a large mound of snow
jack jumps onto the statue of thaddeus burgess
oh my gosh
guardians screening script avid
jamies friends all come running to jamies aide scared
but jamie gets up
wow that looks serious
jamie are you alright
is he okay
did you guys see that
it was amazing
i slid i did a jump and i slid under a car erf
a sofa from the moving van suddenly knocks jamie down
theres a moment of silence as the kids wait to see if jamie is okay
then jamie rises up from behind the sofa grinning a new gap in his smile
he holds up a tooth
dude that means cash
tooth fairy cash
i love the tooth fairy
his fun cut short oh no
thats totally awesome
you lucky bug
i gotta put this under my pillow
i wish i lost my tooth
guardians screening script avid
ah wait a minute

what about all that fun we just had
that wasnt the tooth fairy that was me
i lost two teeth in one day once remember that
what are you gonna spend your money on

how much do you think shes going to leave
as jack looks down from the statue his frustration grows
storm clouds overhead rumble and darken
flurries of snow begin to intensify
my ears are freezing
i cant feel my toes
ah its hot cocoa time
jack jumps down from the statue trying to engage the kids
but its too late the kids take off
jack blocks jamies way as the boy comes running at him
whats a guy gotta do to get a little attention around here
jamie runs through jack as if he where a ghost
jack is left momentarily shaken then
walla mocking her oh im cold im cold im co old
somebody take a picture
that was really awesome
jack is alone again
his temper subsides
he whips up a little wind and disappears
guardians screening script avid
jamie plays with a toy robot as drawings and charts of mystery creatures hang on the wall behind him ufos aliens bigfoot you name it
theres even a drawing of jamie flying in midair on his sled
i did this jump and it was amazing and i slide under a car and it was awesome
then i was flying down this hill and i was like whoosh whoosh whoosh through all these cars and then the sled hit this this thing and i was like

he mimes flying in the air with his robot then crashing to the bed as sophie and their dog sit listening and then bam
the sofa hit me and and see

ah hoo hay ow

sophie laughs and tries to stick a finger in the gap in his gums

jamie sets the toy robot on his nightstand then grabs a stuffed rabbit next to his pillow to reveal a camera and yeah
now dont stay up trying to see her jamie or she wont come
but i can do it this time

we can hide and see the tooth fairy
guardians screening script avid
hide hide hide hide
jamies mom picks sophie up off the bed and lifts her over her shoulder
their dog gets up and begins licking jamies face
uh uh straight to bed now mister
we see jack frost outside hanging upsidedown watching them through the window
the glass frosts over
jack flips onto the roof a little pensive
he makes his way toward the roofs peak and looks up at the moon in full view
it lights up the night sky
if theres something im doing wrong can you can you just tell me what it is
because ive tried everything and no one ever sees me
you put me here the least you can do is tell me tell me why
the moon shines silently down
jack turns away in frustration
jack leaps off the roof onto a telephone pole and begins walking across some telephone wires
a stream of dreamsand suddenly zips by behind him then another which swoops around in front of him
jack turns and looks up a smile now on his lips
right on time sandman
the dreamsand descends from the sky and drifts into windows around the town
jack runs along the telephone wire until he can reach out and intercept one of the passing streams
an adjacent stream takes the shape of a dolphin which turns toward jack before continuing on its way to a waiting child
then we follow one of the streams into a window
guardians screening script avid
dreamsand floats into a window where cupcake is in bed hugging a stuffed unicorn in her sleep
the dreamsand swirls over her head and morphs into a little girl riding a unicorn
the girl smiles at the lovely dream as it flies around the room
then the room darkens as a wispy shadowy figure with a familiar laugh crawls out from under the bed and rises up
he notices cupcakes dream
ohhhh i thought i heard the clippity clop of a unicorn
what an adorable dream
his face softens seemingly moved
leans down to cupcake and look
so sweet so full of hope and wonder
why theres only one thing missing
a touch of fear
pitch reaches into cupcakes dream and touches a bony finger to the unicorn
it turns ashen and black and disintegrates
cupcake flinches in her sleep
pitch snickers delighted
that never gets old
pitch swirls the dreamsand around and it all turns into black corrupted nightmare sand
feel your fear
come on thats right
the black sand morphs into a horrific shadowy bucking horse a nightmare
what a pretty little nightmare
gleefully he grabs the nightmares mane now i want you to go tell the others the wait is over
guardians screening script avid
and sends it out the window where it joins a posse of other nightmares coursing through the streets
they take off and fly into the night sky
pitch steps out into the street from an adjacent alley avoiding the rays of moonlight
he looks up to the sky and stares at the moon
dont look at me like that old friend
you must have known this day would come
my nightmares are finally ready
are your guardians
jack walks along a telephone wire as the dreamsand disappears from the sky
suddenly a shadowy figure and an unfamiliar noise zips by behind him
in the background residents get ready for the night
did you leave the windows open again
the garage door is wide open
jack leaps over a house to an adjacent tree to investigate and again something zooms behind him
jack jumps down from the tree and onto a truck in a nearby alley
the shadow flashes by knocking over a trash can
jack jumps down from the truck and backs up out of the alleyway into a clearing
jack turns around ready to strike
he squints as into the light steps
guardians screening script avid
been a long time
blizzard of i believe
easter sunday wasnt it
jack is completely bewildered bunny
youre not still mad about that
bunny whips out his boomerang and casually looks at it as he holds it in his hands
but this is about something else
before jack realizes whats happening a huge hand reaches into frame and lifts him off his feet
jack has been snatched up by two huge yetis
put me down
jack is shoved head first into a sack
a yeti whips out a snow globe and smashes it on the ground
durtal bardla burdlew
a magic portal opens in front of them
the yetis make way for bunny to leap in but he demurs dwbard urghwetee
not on your nelly
see you back at the pole
guardians screening script avid
he stamps his foot twice on the ground which swirls open a rabbit hole magically appears
bunny leaps into it and disappears along with the rabbit hole
in its place from out of the ground grows a small green plant
the yetis throw jack through the magic portal
the yetis then charge in after and disappear into the portal
to a fairy tangiers
incivie du haut rue de barat
the sack flies out of the portal and lands on the floor
in the darkness jack hears hes here
jack struggles out of the sack to see two elves staring at him
to another fairy walla walla washington
weve got a trampoline mishap at ginger lane
he then looks up to see north and sandman looking down at him
the tooth fairy is surrounded by a dozen hovering tiny fairies who come and go as she blurts out orders
canine lateral and central incisor
guardians screening script avid
north clears his throat
they all turn to a bewildered jack
hey there he is
as north holds out his arms to welcome jack a dreamsand snowflake appears above sandys head
wow you gotta be kidding me
two yetis suddenly grab jack by the shoulders and lift him up onto his feet
whoa put me down
i hope the yetis treated you well
i love being shoved in a sack and tossed through a magic portal
that was my idea
you know bunny obviously
bunny stands off to the side grumbling with his arms crossed
jack suddenly notices the mini tooth fairies hovering near him staring and twittering
and the tooth fairy
before jack can answer shes gliding toward him
ive heard a lot about you
and your teeth
my my what
moves in way too close open up
are they really as white as they say
guardians screening script avid
oh they really do sparkle like freshly fallen snow
several swooning mini teeth flutter around a confused jack batting their lashes and screaming like crazed beatles fans
tooth collects herself and
girls pull yourselves together
lets not disgrace the uniform
sees sandy is snoozing sandy
sandy bolts up awake and steps up to jack smiling
anyone wanna tell me why im here
the wisp of dreamsand above sandys head morphs into a thats not really helping
but thanks little man
i musta done something really bad to get you four together
jack walks away from the group frosting an elf with a tray of cookies as it marches past then turns around
am i on the naughty list
on naughty list
you hold record
but no matter
now we are wiping clean the slate
more to north ah good question
i tell you how come
you are guardian
guardians screening script avid
off jacks confusion yetis light ceremonial torches with a whoosh
elves leap from columns unfurling homemade celebratory banners as they descend
jack brushes off a few baby teeth who try to present him with a necklace made of paper snowflakes
what are you doing
get get that offa me
jacks voice is drowned out by the sounds of horns and drums
this is the best part
an elf marching band strikes up marching into the room
two yetis move jack on to a designated spot on the floor
jack looks down to find an elf pointing at his bare feet
the elf then directs his attention to two approaching elves carrying a pair of ceremonial boots
jacks confusion escalates
a yeti hands north an old large book
north blows off the dust opens it and begins clearing his throat
jack clenches his jaw as he scans the room the mini teeth continue to fawn sandys smiling bunnys apathetic and north looks on with pride
jack suddenly slams his staff down sending a blast of frost and wind across the room
the torches go out and everything stops
what makes you think i want to be a guardian
north bursts out in laughter holding the book in his hands then stops and looks to jack stone faced
of course you do
to the elves music
the elves blare the trumpets again
guardians screening script avid
the music peters out again
an elf throws his trumpet to the ground and storms off
north displeased glowers
look this is all very flattering but ah
you dont want me
youre all hard work and deadlines and im snowballs and fun times
im not a guardian
yeah thats exactly what i said
i dont think you understand what it is we do
tooth swoops in and turns jacks attention to the massive globe behind him
each of those lights is a child
jack looks up at the globe taking in the enormity of this
north suddenly moves to jacks side
a child who believes
and good or bad naughty or nice we protect them
fingers out of mouth
we cut back to discover that tooth is examining jacks teeth
jack moves away from the globe and back toward the center of the room
okay no more wishy washy
pitch is out there doing who knows what
you mean the boogeyman
when pitch threatens us he threatens them as well
guardians screening script avid
north points to the lights on the globe
all the more reason to pick someone more qualified
you think we pick
no you were chosen like we were all chosen
by man in moon
jack turns and looks to the group
stares dumbstruck what
last night jack
he chose you
the man in the moon he talks to you
jack looks up to the skylight taking in the awesome sight of the moon as it shines down on earth
you see you can not say no
it is destiny
jack is still confused by the news
what does it mean
but why why wouldnt he tell me that himself
after years this is his answer
to spend eternity like you guys cooped up in some some hideout thinking of of new ways to bribe kids
no no thats not for me
jack turns to leave the guardians are stunned
how is that not offensive
except for bunny who is relieved by this turn and looks to the others
guardians screening script avid
you know what i think
i think we just dodged a bullet
i mean whats this clown know about bringing joy to children anyway
jack turns back
a little pissed
uhh you ever hear of a snow day
i know its no hard boiled egg but kids like what i do
but none of em believe in you
leans in to him do they
you see youre invisible mate
its like you dont even exist
jack tries not to look stung by this
no the kangaroos right
the the what whatd you call me
i am not a kangaroo mate
and this whole time i thought you were
if youre not a kangaroo what are you
im a bunny
the easter bunny
people believe in me
sandy nudges north who acknowledges the tension in the air
walk with me
guardians screening script avid
jack and north ride an elevator bearing the resemblance of a christmas ornament down to the factory floor
its nothing personal north
what you all do its just its not my thing
man in moon says it is your thing
we will see
north storms through factory floor jack trying to keep up
an amazing place
slow down wouldja
ive been trying to bust in here for years i want a good look
peeved still rushing what do you mean bust in
oh dont worry i never got past the yetis
jack looks over his shoulder an angry yeti pounds his fist into his palm
oh hey phil
keep up jack
north charges ahead
norths factory is bustling with activity yetis are building toys moving packages while elves are test piloting the various flying toys
as jack walks behind north surveying the factory a duck toy suddenly flies over jacks head
jack ducks just in time and continues after north
guardians screening script avid
i always thought the elves made the toys
we just let them believe that
jack looks over to see a group of elves eating christmas ornaments and another electrocuting himself with christmas lights
north smiles and calls to them
keep up good work
north continues through the factory floor
he passes a yeti putting the finishing touches on a blue toy robot
i dont like it
paint it red
the yeti reacts in dismay as we reveal hundreds of finished blue robots
step it up everybody
as north and jack move to the opposite end of the chamber we finally glimpse the orchestrated chaos of the entire workshop in all its magic and splendor
jack follows north into his office
there are shelves filled with toys
sketches and prototypes everywhere
north dusts his hands and turns to jack
his sleeves are rolled
jack notices that on one of norths forearms is tattooed the word naughty and on the other nice
north grabs a plate from a nearby elf
ah no thanks
north hurls it crash
a pause as north looks at jack
guardians screening script avid
now we get down to tacks of brass
tacks of brass
as north cracks his knuckles jack stands silent
the wind suddenly slams norths office door behind them
jack looks to the door it locks itself and he turns back
north moves in close to jack backing him up against the door
who are you jack frost
what is your center
north pokes jack in the chest
if man in moon chose you to be a guardian you must have something very special inside
north stands up straight and begins to stroke his beard as he gives jack a curious look
north is standing in front of a shelf of russian nesting dolls
one is carved to look like north himself
this is how you see me no
very big intimidating
but if you get to know me a little hands the doll to jack well go on
jack gives north a curious look then sets down his staff
he twists the doll in half and inside is another carved north doll this one is a more typical santa claus red cheeked and cheery
you are downright jolly
ah but not just jolly
guardians screening script avid
the dolls get progressively smaller as he twists them open all versions of north but all slightly different
i am also mysterious
twist smaller doll and fearless
twist smaller doll and caring
and at my center
as north approaches jack looks down and drops the final russian doll into the palm of norths hand
its the size of a jelly bean
theres a tiny wooden baby
what do you see
jack holds it up to examine it
you have big eyes
because they are full
that is my center
it is what i was born with
eyes that have always seen the wonder in everything
north raises his hands and the toys on the shelves suddenly spring to life
jack in the boxes pop toy trains speed around the room soldiers march about toy planes fly overhead
an elf gets carried aloft by a balloon
a flying toy plane glides by and we follow it as it makes its way around the room
a christmas tree is ablaze with bright lights
two double doors suddenly open as the flying car enters the factory floor
eyes that see lights in the trees and magic in the air
as it crosses the frame dozens of other toys are now flying around the massive chamber
its a truly magical moment
north now stands outside his office with jack at his side
this wonder is what i put into the world and what i protect in children
guardians screening script avid
it is what makes me a guardian
it is my center
what is yours
i dont know
jack looks down into his open palm the wooden baby stares back at him
north closes jacks hand
they exchange a look
then something suddenly jets past a window outside
almost simultaneously bunny and sandman come running down the hallway toward north and jack
we have a problem mate
trouble at the tooth palace
north shoves open a set of double doors followed closely by bunny sandy and jack
several yetis rush by as they prepare the hangar for launch
boys ship shape
as soon as impossible
i told you im not going with you guys
there is no way im climbing into some rickety old
suddenly the sound of pounding hooves
santas incredible sleigh comes into view
its a huge shiny tricked out jaw dropping hot rod of a sled
jack is understandably gob smacked so much so that he almost gets knocked over by one of the reindeer
guardians screening script avid
moi deti moi deti
the sleigh comes to a standstill as the guardians prepare to climb inside
several yetis are still running around making last minute preparations
okay one ride but thats it
jack jumps aboard
north smiles knowingly and climbs inside
sandy hops up into the back seat
everyone loves the sleigh
north grabs the reigns wrapping them around his arms
he turns to see bunnymund standing there frozen and unnerved
bunny what are you waiting for
i think my tunnels might be faster mate
and um and safer
ah get in
hoists bunnymund up buckle up
bunny desperately looks around his seat
whoa whoa whoa where are the bloody seatbelts
that was just expression
north turns to one of the yetis
are we ready
the yeti throws his hands up in a fit shaking his head no
cracks the reigns hyah
guardians screening script avid
the sleigh is off
elves and yetis scatter out of its path
sandy bunny and jack fly back into their seats
bunny clutches the edge of his terrified
jack cant help but laugh
out of the way
the sleigh heads down a luge like track
north and jack are enjoying the ride
north cracks the reigns the sleigh plummets an almost vertical drop
sandy grins calmly
jack loves this
bunnymund not so much
slow down slow down
north pulls a lever kicking the sleigh into overdrive
he looks back as the sleigh enters a corkscrew
i hope you like the loopty loops
i hope you like carrots
here we go
wide shot as the sleigh reaches the bottom of the ramp and shoots upwards launching them into bright blue sky
north reins in hand leans into the wind as the reindeer climb higher
guardians screening script avid
jack in his element leaps up onto the rear of the sleigh to watch the north pole fade into the distance
bunnymund peaks off the side of the sleigh then leans back and holds on for dear life
hey bunny bunny turns to see jack standing on the back edge of the sleigh
check out this view jack is swept off the sleigh and disappears
bunny gasps in horror and looks over the side
only to see jack lounging on the sleighs skid
you do care
ah rack off you bloody show pony
bunny glowers as jack makes his way back into the sleigh
hold on everyone i know a shortcut
oh strewth i knew we should have taken the tunnels
north holds a snow globe up to his face
i say tooth palace
an image of the tooth palace appears inside the snowglobe
north throws the globe into the air and a giant vortex opens
guardians screening script avid
a surreal light surrounds the sleigh as it hits hyperdrive and gets sucked through the snow globe portal with a whoosh
the sleigh suddenly comes out of hyperdrive at the outskirts of the tooth palace
streaks of black rapidly approaching
suddenly our heroes find themselves in the midst of mayhem as hundreds of nightmares and terrified tooth fairies jet past
its like a meteor storm
north yanks the reins and the sleigh veers sharply dodging the oncoming nightmares
what are they
sandy and bunny duck the onslaught
jack now sees that the nightmares are actually gulping down the fleeing fairies and flying off with them
theyre taking the tooth fairies
jack looks up to see a lone fairy with a nightmare snapping at its heels
jack leaps into the air and rescues it before the nightmare can snatch it away
jack lands back in the sleigh
he opens his hand to reveal baby tooth whos shaking with fear
hey little baby tooth you okay
as baby tooth nods north steers the sleigh forward through the storm toward the entrance of tooths palace
guardians screening script avid
a vast chamber supported by pillars containing millions of tiny wooden deposit boxes from floor to ceiling
north spots a nightmare up ahead and hands jack the reigns
here take over
jack though surprised quickly grabs the reigns and smiles as he snaps them
north readies his sword and slices the nightmare in half yah
several tooth boxes spill out of the split nightmare and rain down into the sleigh at the guardians feet
the nightmare disintegrates into black sand
theyre stealing the teeth
sandy looks at his hands and sees the nightmare sand take shape and drift away
he and bunny exchange a look
the guardians turn theyre headed straight for a pillar
jack look out
jack pulls the reins aaaahhhh
the sleigh nearly misses the pillar and skids to a rough stop on a platform
they see tooth up above
are you alright
tooth is flying around visibly frustrated
this is bad
guardians screening script avid
they they took my fairies
and the teeth
all of them
everything is gone
only then does it hit her
tooths wings drop in defeat
shes completely lost amidst the devastation
the guardians rush to comfort her
jack stays behind as baby tooth pops out from the hood of his tunic and flies over toward tooth
oh thank goodness
one of you is alright
i have to say this is very very exciting
pitchs voice echoes across the open chamber
they look up to see pitch standing high above them with a satisfied smile
the big four all in one place
im a little star struck
did you like my show on the globe north
got you all together didnt i
tooth darts after pitch but he escapes into the shadows
pitch you have got thirty seconds to return my fairies
tooth follows the sound of pitchs voice and finds him near one of her tooth box columns
youll stick a quarter under my pillow
why are you doing this
maybe i want what you have
to be believed in
jack takes this in
pitch moves along the walls and shadows of the chamber and emerges from behind a column
guardians screening script avid
maybe im tired of hiding under beds
maybe thats where you belong
ah go suck an egg rabbit
bunny looks down past the edge of the platform to find pitch upside down staring him in the face
pitch disappears again
hang on is that
since when are you all so chummy
jack turns and sees pitch standing in the middle of a column
a neutral party
then im going to ignore you
but you must be used to that by now
you shadow sneaking rat bag
bunny goes after pitch but he disappears and reemerges on an opposite column
tooth spots him grabs one of bunnys boomerangs and flies at pitch in a rage
pitch looks at tooth with a smile and before she can reach him a huge nightmare darts out of hiding and rears up at her
tooth falls back
baby tooth hides in jacks tunic
hey easy girl
pitch draws a wisp of black sand from onyxs mane twirls it in his palm and turns toward sandy
guardians screening script avid
look familiar sandman
took me a while to perfect this little trick
turning dreams into nightmares
pitch notices the shocked guardians
dont be nervous it only riles them up more
they smell fear you know
no ones been afraid of you since the dark ages
pitchs eyes flash with anger
but then he smiles
oh the dark ages
a parent and her two children huddled around a campfire scream as a shadow resembling pitch washes over them
it makes its way up the side of a mountain to reveal pitch smiling as he stares up at the moon
such happy times for me
oh the power i wielded
but then the man in the moon chose you to replace my fear with your wonder and light
norths sleigh flies in front of the moon
tooth and her fairies flit by while sandys dreamsand dances across the sky and bunny leaps across rooftops
lifting their hearts
and giving them hope
guardians screening script avid
pitch thinner and weaker than he is now slips back into the shadows after children run through him while playing in the streets laughing as they go
meanwhile everyone wrote me off as just a bad dream
oh theres nothing to be afraid of
theres no such thing as the boogeyman
pitch leans toward the guardians showing nothing but contempt
well thats all about to change
a sound behind pitch one of the columns of the palace begins to crack and crumble as if decaying
tooth is stunned
oh look its happening already
tooths eyes widen in shock
children are waking up and realizing the tooth fairy never came
lifting pillows and finding their baby teeth still there
i mean such a little thing but to a child
pull out from the last vignette all the way out of tooths wide open eye and back to scene
jack mystified moves closer to tooth as the palace continues to crumble
whats going on
they they dont believe in me anymore
guardians screening script avid
didnt they tell you jack
its great being a guardian but theres a catch
if enough kids stop believing everything your friends protect wonder hopes and dreams it all goes away
and little by little so do they
jacks realizes now the magnitude of pitchs plan
no christmas or easter or little fairies that come in the night
there will be nothing
but fear and darkness and me
its your turn not to be believed in
bunny throws his boomerangs at pitch who quickly ducks out of the way as they fly around the chamber columns
pitch then jumps onto the back of onyx down into the depths of the palace
the guardians dive after him followed by jack
bunny grabs a set of egg bombs and launches them at pitch exploding seconds before pitch hits the ground
the guardians land hes gone
tooth deflated sits on the ground with an empty tooth box in her hands
baby tooth resting on a nearby broken tooth box looks to tooth with concern
jack walks up and crouches down alongside tooth
okay alright i admit it you were right about pitch
this is one time i wish i was wrong
but he will pay
guardians screening script avid
im sorry about the fairies
not her bubbly self you shouldve seen them
they put up such a fight
why would pitch take the teeth
its not the teeth he wanted
its the memories inside them
what do you mean
tooth leads jack across the pond the water freezing under his feet as he walks
thats why we collect the teeth jack
they hold the most important memories of childhood
tooth directs him to a mural which illustrates this
my fairies and i watch over them and when someone needs to remember whats important we help them
jack takes a second to admire the immense beauty of the mural before him
we had everyones here
from when you were young
before you became jack frost
but i wasnt anyone before i was jack frost
guardians screening script avid
of course you were
we were all someone before we were chosen
you shouldve seen bunny
hey i told you never to mention that
jack confused is trying to process all this
that night at the pond
i just why i assumed
are you saying are you saying i had a life before that
with a home
and a family
you really dont remember
jacks expression says it all
finally the key to all his questions
all these years and the answers were right here
if i find my memories then ill know why im here
you have to show me
jack using his control of the wind lifts up off the ground and flies across the pond
i cant jack
pitch has them
jack floats down onto a rock overlooking the guardians
then we have to get them back
suddenly a patch of tooths feathers fall out and disappears
the guardians eyes fill with worry
guardians screening script avid
jack is stricken
he looks back the ancient mural begins the children
were too late
no such thing as too late
wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
the others look at each other as if hes nuts
we will collect the teeth
we get teeth
children keep believing in you
were talking seven continents
millions of kids
give me break
you know how many toys i deliver in one night
and eggs i hide in one day
north turns to jack
and jack if you help us we will get you your memories
jack looks to tooth who gives him a reassuring smile
sandy gives to enthusiastic thumbs up while bunny groans
jack looks back to north with a smile
guardians screening script avid
we transition to the shanghai skyline as north booms up out of a chimney dashing along the rooftops
north booms down another chimney as bunnymund races into view a rooftop away
here we go here we go
jack zips into view calling out to bunny
hop to it rabbit im five teeth ahead
yeah right look id tell you to stay outta my way but really whats the point because you wont be able to keep up anyway
is that a challenge cottontail
oh you dont wanna race a rabbit mate
as we pan across the rooftops boom
north bursts up out of a nearby chimney
is it a race
north jumps into one chimney then shoots out of another across the way
this is going to be
north disappears down yet another chimney only to emerge with a bang out the top of another
guardians screening script avid
as north leaps out of frame tooth darts into view in hummingbird overdrive dazzled by the lights and traffic
baby tooth struggles to keep up
four bicuspids over there
an incisor two blocks east
is that a molar
tooth overwhelmed jets off without paying attention and thoomp she smacks into a toothpaste billboard
jack jumps up to the billboard to check on her
ah you okay
sorry its been a really long time since ive been out in the field
how long is a long time
ah four hundred forty years
give or take
tooth jerks to attention suddenly her view zooms in thru a little girls bedroom window a tiny glow under her pillow marks a freshly planted tooth
tooth gasps and her eyes go wide she flies to the window excited
jack reacts looks to baby tooth its gonna be a long night
jack cocksure arrives outside an open window
his smile suddenly disappears when he sees a rabbit hole open up in the bedroom floor and bunny hops out
guardians screening script avid
bunny now holding the tooth in his paw turns to jack and laughs
jack not amused zaps bunny with burst of frost from his staff
the guardians fly over a middle eastern city in norths sleigh as the full moon lights up the night sky
north pulls two teeth one with each hand twins
bunny pulls out his hand from under a pillow revealing jackpot
pull out wider to reveal hockey trophies posters and paraphernalia everywhere
looks like youre a bit of a brumby hey mate
north stands at the side of a boys bed
is piece of pie
he falls into a rabbit hole finding himself face to face with bunny
sandman enters and takes the boys tooth for himself
guardians screening script avid
thats my tooth
jack parkours between two buildings and into a window
jack flies in through the window when suddenly a rabbit hole appears
as jack disappears through the rabbit hole bunny appears through an adjacent hole laughing to himself
tooth reaches under a pillow and pulls out a tooth with a mouse attached to the other end
baby tooth tackles the mouse
whoa whoa whoa
take it easy there champ
hes one of us
part of the european division
to the mouse ca va
the mouse gestures back angrily
north and the guardians riding norths sleigh exit a wormhole
north laughs as they fly over the city
bunny pulls a note from under a pillow instead of a tooth
the note shows an arrow pointing toward the window
he looks up to the window north holds up a tooth as he grins then leaps off the ledge laughing
guardians screening script avid
bunny lands on a rooftop holding a tooth in his paw and proud of himself
then bunny hears the sound of ice and crikey
and disappears from view
bunny is now sliding down the side of a roof on a sheet of ice
jack grabs the tooth from bunnys paw as he slides past and holds it high in the air
jack holds up the tooth but within moments a hand snatches it
jack looks to see sandy waving bye bye as he flies off on his dreamsand cloud
north dances across a rooftop and quickly drops into a chimney to enter a house we drop fast through the roof and to see bunnys paw as it lights the
bunny grins demonically in the firelight
ho ho ho
a large burst of fire shoots out the top of a distant chimney
guardians screening script avid
jack north sandy and bunny stand proudly
each one of them revealing their own bag filled with teeth to tooth
tooth is overwhelmed by their collective effort
you guys collect teeth and leave gifts as fast as my fairies
their eyes widen and tooth is suddenly panic stricken
you guys have been leaving gifts right
the rest of the group turns to each other sinking their heads and biting their lips in embarrassment
the guardians stand in line waiting their turn to put dollar bills into a coin dispenser
baby tooth puts a coin under a pillow
now jack puts a coin under a pillow
norths hand pulls a tooth from under a pillow
he replaces it pair of candy canes and a few coins
bunny stomps his feet and falls through a rabbit hole to reveal a pair of easter eggs atop a childs bed
sandy walks through a doggy door with a coin in his hand
in shock he sees north laughing while arranging christmas decorations in the childs bedroom
a young boy holding a stuffed animal and a sippy cup to his mouth looks out his bedroom window
the guardians cast in moonlight bound across the adjacent rooftops
the young boy dumbfounded drops his juice
guardians screening script avid
the guardians fly across the night sky only to disappear through a snowglobe portal
nearby a nightmare observes as the sleigh vanishes
it leaps off the roof through a drain and down into the sewers
the spy nightmare flies down into a dark cavernous space
large steel cages hang all around and trapped inside are the the nightmare heads toward pitch standing at his own globe which is conspicuously covered in lights
why arent they going out
the nightmare approaches from behind and lets out a soft whiney pitch stiffens at the news
theyre collecting the teeth
the mini teeth perk up at this and start twittering excitedly which echoes throughout the lair
oh pipe down or ill stuff a pillow with you
the mini teeth begin to settle down
pitch looks at the nightmare frustrated and scowls
the nightmare winces and disperses into tiny particles
a strand of nightmare sand from the nightmare twirls in the air and pitch twists it with his fingers turning it into a crude image of the sandman
fine have your last hurrah
for tomorrow all you pathetic scrambling will be for nothing
guardians screening script avid
and he crushes the image in his fist
a cool looking robot toy rests on jamies bedside table
jamie is sound asleep in bed
a smile across his face reveals the recently formed gap between his teeth
left central incisor knocked out in a freak sledding accident
i wonder how that could have happened jack
jack laughs as he looks at jamies drawing of himself during the snowball fight on the wall
hes midair blasting his friends with snowballs
he smiles and then turns to tooth
he watches as tooth reaches under the pillow
she hovers over jamie as he stirs in his sleep
a dreamy smile comes over her as she gazes down at the sleeping boy
this was always the part i liked most seeing the kids
why did i ever stop doing this
a beat jack sees how much it means to her
its a little different up close huh
tooth gives him a look hes right
thanks for being here jack
i wish i had known about your memory i couldve helped you
guardians screening script avid
yeah well look lets just get you taken care of
then its pitchs turn huh
a sudden commotion
they both turn to the window
here you are
north carrying a large sack over his shoulder struggles to climb in through the small window
sandman and baby tooth climb in after
oh what gives slowpokes
jamie is still sound asleep
how you feeling toothy
thats what i want to hear
oh i see how it is
bunny comes in through a rabbit hole in the floorboards
all working together to make sure the rabbit gets last place
north now holds his index fingers up to his lips
you think i need help to beat a bunny
check it out peter cottontail
jack lifts up his sack of teeth
guardians screening script avid
you call that a bag of choppers
lifting larger sack now thats a bag of choppers
this is about tooth
its not a competition
but if it was reveals even larger sack i win
and he strikes a russian dancing pose as
suddenly a bright circle of light is cast on the guardians
they all turn slowly to see jamie sitting up in bed holding a flashlight wide awake and beaming in disbelief
the easter bunny
the tooth fairy
i knew youd come
he can see us
jamie looks around amazed he sees everyone but jack
most of us
you guys hes still awake
knock him out
they all look to him scandalized
jamie looks concerned
guardians screening script avid
with the dreamsand ya gumbies
but then jamies greyhound rises up into frame fully awake its nostrils flaring at the scent hes picked up
no stop thats the easter bunny
what are you doing abbey
the dog is nose to nose with bunnymund
alright nobody panic
but thats a um thats a greyhound
do you know what greyhounds do to rabbits
i think its a pretty safe bet hes never met a rabbit like me while sandy forms a dreamsand baseball jack rolls his eyes and notices an alarm clock on
the bedside table
six foot one nerves of steel master of tai chi and the ancient jack cant resist he reaches over stealthily and sets off the alarm clock with his staff
bunny is off like a shot the greyhound right on his tail running laps in the small room the dog barking like crazy
sandy amused makes a dreamsand baseball to stop the dog but bobbles it as the dog brushes past
down girl down
the others stand out of the way as bunny and the dog run up the walls and over the bed
guardians screening script avid
as tooth tries to silence the alarm clock jack can barely contain his laughter
sandy takes aim as bunny and the dog run circles around him sandy sandy
the dog jumps past north knocking him back
as sandy winds up the dog suddenly smacks right into him
the dreamsand goes flying
hey this is not proper tooth fairy behavior
north ducks out of the way as the dreamsand sails toward him
the dreamsand baseball smacks tooth right in the face and explodes into golden dust
tooth and her fairy fall to the ground as a golden tooth takes shape above their heads
streams of dreamsand make their way around the room
ah this things rabid
get this dingo off me
bunny gets a whiff of the golden sand
the image of a carrot quickly takes shape in front of his face
bunny falls over asleep
so does the dog
north tries to scramble out of the way but theres no escape in this tiny room
he teeters for a moment as dreamsand candy canes appear before him then falls like a giant sequoia landing thud
on the end of jamies bed which sends jamie catapulting through the air
luckily he lands oof
in sandys arms
he starts to wake up again but sandy is there with a fistful of sand boof
and jamie too is out cold
guardians screening script avid
jack and sandy look down at the sleeping boy relieved
then they look around a heap of sleeping snoring bodies
bunny is snuggled up next to north
a carrot and candy canes made of dreamsand hold hands as they dance above bunny and norths head
jack comes down off the dresser and turns to sandy who has put jamie back in bed
sandy lifts norths arm and lets go its completely limp and falls flat
sandy smiles at jack who chuckles
oh i really wish i had a camera right now
sandy eyes suddenly widen
theres a nightmare behind jack
jack turns to see a nightmare staring through the window
without hesitation jack jumps out the window after it
we can find pitch
sandy pauses for a moment then follows jacks lead
the sleeping guardians are where we left them
jamies bedroom door opens and sophie toddles in
she takes in the scene amused
she toddles over to north giggling
she pokes at his rotund belly
then she notices something
she reaches into his pocket and pulls out a snow globe
she looks over to see the easter bunny sound asleep on the floor
suddenly the snow globe lights up
sophies eyes widen as she looks at the beautiful vista inside the globe
its bunnys warren
she takes the globe and toddles off for the door when she trips again and the snow globe smashes on the floor
guardians screening script avid
a flash of light
she looks up to see a magical portal open in front of her
a gust wind comes blowing out of the portal
sophie giggles and toddles through the portal
norths bleary eyes pop open mid snore
two nightmares zigzag along the rooftops searching for victims
jack loving the chase is in hot pursuit with sandy whos riding along on a streak of dreamsand wahooo
one of the nightmares splits off angling for a bedroom window
sandy calmly follows the nightmare flies right through the window and sandy does the same the other one angles up over the houses roof to evade jack who parkours over
the roof after it waaahahoooo
through the windows below flashes of golden and sickly green light race through the house as sandy battles the nightmare the nightmares and jack zoom away from the house just
as sandy and the first nightmare blast out of the window sandy wrestling it until poof
it explodes into golden dreamsand which he quickly transforms into a sting ray for him to ride guardians screening script avid
jack flies through town on the heels of the nightmare
it makes a sharp turn down an alleyway and jack is quick to follow
the nightmare then veers up the wall of the alley and onto a rooftop
jack whips a blast from his staff and hits the nightmare before it disappears from view
i got it
jack jumps up onto the roof and prods the frozen nightmare with his staff
sandy did you see that
look at this thing
jack can barely contain his excitement as he calls out to sandy but suddenly pitch lurches out from behind an air conditioning unit on the rooftop
jack blasts a wave of frost across the rooftop but pitch easily dodges it reappearing behind jack on the adjoining rooftop
you know for a neutral party you spend an awful lot of time with those weirdos
this isnt your fight jack
jacks eyes narrow
he holds out his staff ready to strike
you made it my fight when you stole those teeth
pitch regards him curiously
why do you care about the teeth
when he notices something and turns to find sandy calmly standing on the rooftop next to him
pitch quickly sidesteps moving away from sandy
guardians screening script avid
now this is who im looking for before pitch can finish a dreamsand stream whips around him forcing him to duck and dodge sandys sudden attack
pitch disperses a stream of nightmare sand turning it into a gigantic sickle and swings it back at sandy
jack ducks avoiding injury as sandys pushed back against a ledge
sandy quickly grabs pitch with another dreamsand stream and yanks him off his feet slamming him repeatedly against the tops of the buildings until finally throwing him off the rooftop
pitch bounces off the ground as he crashes into an empty street
as sandy dusts his hands and calmly steps off the rooftop to follow jack looks on astonished
remind me not to get on your bad side
pitch shakes off the crash trying to back up as sandy touches down and moves toward him jack following
pitch cowers on the ground in fear as they approach
looks up pleading okay easy
you cant blame me for trying sandy
you dont know what its like to be weak and hated
it was stupid of me to mess with your dreams
so ill tell you what sandy continues forward grim faced
but suddenly pitch stops cowering and stands up
his tone changes
you can have em back
before jack and sandy can react a nightmare shoots up through a storm drain as several other nightmares gather in the alley behind him
guardians screening script avid
jack and sandy look around as hundreds of nightmares descend from the surrounding rooftops to encircle them
this doesnt look good
jack worried looks to sandy and mutters
you take the ones on the left ill take the ones on the right
meanwhile pitch rises up from off the ground as onyx takes shape underneath him
pitch grabs onto onyxs mane as it snorts and snarls
he then leans forward
pitchs army of nightmares begin to charge
then suddenly the sound of bells and reindeer echo in the distance norths sleigh bursts through the clouds
jack and pitch look up into the sky as it circles overhead
the sleigh turns toward pitch only to fly a few feet over his head
pitch turns as it passes over him slightly confused
norths asleep at the wheel along with bunny and tooth
suddenly the sleigh clips one of its skis as it flies over city hall jolting north to attention
bunny awakes with a fright from a bad a dream
get outta my warren
realizes hes awake now huh
still battling nightmares sandy propels himself and jack into the air with a stream of dreamsand and launches jack away from the nightmares
jack quickly orients himself and knocks an oncoming nightmare with his staff
tooth quickly jumps off the side of the sleigh toward jack and sandy
guardians screening script avid
jack knocks away a few more nightmares with his staff and looks up
tooth suddenly flies into view through the swarm of nightmares slicing them apart with her wings causing them to explode into black sand
pitch gives a signal and leaps into the air leading another wave of nightmares after the guardians
back in the sleigh bunny jumps out and lands on a nearby roof
bunny quickly tosses his boomerang which disintegrates every nightmare in its path
bunny catches the returning boomerang leaps off the roof and grabs the skids of the sleigh as it passes by
north stands drawing both his scimitars and dices the oncoming nightmares to bits as they attack
jack heads back to the sleigh by dodging two nightmares as they attack
as he continues his descent jack is suddenly blind sided by another nightmare which knocks the staff from his hands
for a moment jack is in a state of panic as he finds himself in free fall
he finally manages to hook onto the staff control his descent and land on the sleigh as it flies past
coolly to jack you might want to duck
jack ducks as a nightmare rears up behind him but one of bunnys boomerangs blasts through it and zips back to bunnys waiting paw
guardians screening script avid
sandy high up in he clouds does his best to contain the mass of nightmares that are swirling around him
pitch rises from behind a group of nightmares
he stretches his arms as an arrow of nightmare sand forms behind him
jack and the guardians watch as more nightmares speed away to join their herd
sandy looks overwhelmed by the onslaught
we gotta help sandy
north cracks the reigns turns the sleigh and heads toward the swirling cloud of yellow and black sand
pitch takes aim and releases the arrow
it flies through the air and into sandys back exploding on impact
the guardians look on horrified
jack leaps ahead of the sleigh and flies toward sandy
sandy feels the shock and turns around
a patch of blackness starts slowly spreading across his body
pitch laughs as he and sandy lock eyes
guardians screening script avid
dont fight the fear little man
the guardians continue to speed toward sandy but nightmares begin colliding with the sleigh slowing their progress
pitch relishes this moment of triumph
id say sweet dreams but there arent any left
sandy his eyes filled with terror falls to his knees as the patch of blackness continues to spread
jack presses on trying to reach sandy as fast as he can
sandy stands up accepting his fate and closes his eyes as he and his dreamsand cloud are consumed by the writhing blackness of the nightmare sand
horrified clenches his staff as he flies toward pitch
guardians screening script avid
his beautiful golden dreamsand now black merges with the rest of pitchs nightmare sand
is beyond delighted
his plan actually worked
pitch then notices jack flying towards him glowing energy emanating from jacks staff
pitch raises his hands and sends a massive wave of nightmares toward jack
the guardians are stunned
jack quickly realizes thats hes in over his head as the attacking nightmares begin to overtake him
hes engulfed by nightmares and there is nothing but silence
pitch looks on with a smile until a bolt of lightning suddenly erupts from within the writhing black sand
a gust of wind blows past pitch quickly followed by a massive wave of ice and frost that rockets back up the stream of nightmare sand toward him culminating in
an explosion of ice and snow
jack free falls back to earth unconscious
guardians screening script avid
tooth quickly rescues him and sets him back down in the sleigh
jack how did you do that
i i didnt know i could
pitch pulls himself laboriously from the mud and weeds amongst the trees where hes crash landed oddly he seems delighted
he looks up to see a bright glow norths snowglobe portal
the sleigh zooms into it and it winks out
pitch shakes the frost from his arms as scores of nightmares swarm behind pitch regrouping after the blast
pitch at the center seems as pleased as can be
someone who knows how to have a little fun
were in the midst of a somber ceremony marking the passing of sandy
burning candles line the perimeter of sandys stone emblem
tooth sets down a candle and stands shoulder to shoulder with north and bunny
the three hold hands in solace
the ringing of somber bells can be heard echoing throughout the chamber as we reveal the elves and a yeti ringing the elf bells as part of a ceremonial dirge
jack facing a window frosts over the glass with his finger to form a symbol of sandy
north slowly walks up behind him
guardians screening script avid
are you alright
jack remains still his eyes fixed on the image of sandy
i just i wish i couldve done something
jack you stood up to pitch
you saved us
but sandy wo putting his hand on would be proud of what you did
jack pulls back his hoodie and stands up
i dont know who you were in your past life but in this life you are guardian
but how can i know who i am until i find out who i was
i feel it in my belly
jack and north approach the globe which is losing lights at an alarming rate
look how fast theyre going out
hes tipped the balance
jack drifts up closer the globe
he looks at the lights going out then back to the guardians
theres a nervous tension in the room
twirling his boomerang hey buck up ya sad sacks
we can still turn this around
guardians screening script avid
easter is tomorrow and i need your help
i say we pull out all the stops and we get those little lights flickering again
a massive wooden door swings open north leads jack and the guardians through the doorway into an elevator and through his factory
bunny is right
as much as it pains me to say old friend this time easter is more important than christmas
did everyone hear that
we must hurry to the warren
everyone to the sleigh
ohh no mate
my warren my rules
bunny directs the groups attention to the ground
he taps his foot and a rabbit hole opens up under their feet
the guardians plummet through bunnys tunnels
jack bunny and tooth arrive gracefully in the warrens antechamber while north and the yetis comes to a crashing halt
guardians screening script avid
is very funny
welcome to the warren bunny stands before them when suddenly he shifts his attention
he turns his ears perk up and his nose sniffs the air
a faint scream begins to echo from within the depths of one of bunnys egg tunnels
tiny eggs come scuttling out from the tunnel
bunny grabs his boomerang north draws his sword and jack readies his staff as the sounds of booming footsteps screams and the rustling of foliage grows louder
bunny begins to charge toward the tunnel
at his side are the guardians yetis and sentinel eggs all bellowing their loudest battle cries until
sophie bursts out
all momentum comes to a halt
they immediately withdraw their weapons mildly embarrassed
sophie giggles and immediately runs after one of the elves
elf elf elf
what is she doing here
north looks down at his coat pocket ooops
ah snow globe
somebody do something
dont look at me im invisible remember
guardians screening script avid
sophie giggles as she drags the elf by the bell atop its uniform
dont worry bunny
i bet shes a fairy fan
flies up to sophie its okay little one
you know what i got something for you
here it is
she pulls something out look at all the pretty teeth with little blood and gum on them
sophie runs away screaming
blood and gums
when was the last time you guys actually hung out with kids
meanwhile sophie is running around the warren exploring and playing
sophie pokes her head into a small tunnel
peek a boo
we are very busy bringing joy to children
we dont have time
jack walks toward her forming a snowflake which floats over toward sophie
she tries to grab at it
if one little kid can ruin easter then
were in worse shape than i thought
sophie follows the snowflake as jack leads it over to bunny
weee weee weee
guardians screening script avid
the snowflake lands on bunnys nose and his concerns suddenly seem to slip away
jacks magic is taking affect
close up on a flower that opens to reveal an egg
the egg stands up wobbly on its spindly little legs
we pull out to reveal sophie and bunnys faces looking on sophie amazed bunny proud
you wanna paint some eggs
come on then
we pull out further to reveal a massive stone spire covered in moss as thousands of unpainted eggs stream down the side of it toward a green meadow
north and jack stand in the midst of it all slack jawed as the eggs rush towards them
thats a lot of eggs
uh how much time do we have
bunny hops into view sophie clinging to his back smiling leading a huge mass of eggs down a wide path
as he passes flowers bloom on either side in his wake blasting the passing eggs with color as they go
alright troops its time to push back
that means eggs
guardians screening script avid
north looks out over the eggs as they get sorted
sophie on her back is carried by the eggs through the sorting stones
she giggles as north waves at her while she passes by
heaps of you in every high rise farm house and trailer park
baby tooth flies across the screen diverting our attention to a multicolored stream off in the distance
in tennis shoes and cereal bowls
baby tooth joins an elf who stands alongside an egg at the edge of a cliff
the elf pushes the egg over the cliff into the stream and celebrates with a victory dance
oh there will be bathtubs filled with my beautiful googies
the elf turns just in time to see a stampede of colored eggs come barreling toward him
they knock him off the cliff as he and the eggs spill into the multi colored stream below
colored eggs wade through the water emerging with secondary colors and intricate patterns of all kinds
an unlucky egg veers off and gets stuck in a whirlpool
we see a hand fish it out to reveal north who looks at the egg curiously
its now got a spiral pattern on it and its little legs kick madly
okay thats little strange
naw mate bunnys surrounded by butterflies and cute little eggs
guardians screening script avid
as a technicolored elf climbs out of the stream north sets the egg down and lets it rejoin the herd
as sophie leads a parade of eggs bunny jumps to an adjacent rock and sits up to address the eggs as they walk in stride
meanwhile jack rides atop a group of sentinel egg that are marching in the back ground
there will be springtime
on every continent
and im bringing hope with me
close on a line of eggs running down curled vines as yetis sprinkle them with glitter
they continue on down various vine corkscrew like shoots decorating the eggs with stripes
a confused elf emerges from the vines striped with paint and walks off
the striped elf walks past a yeti painting a mound of eggs red
bunny enters frame and hops across the screen
too christmas y mate paint em blue
the yeti throws its arms up in defeat and tosses the eggs
a beautifully painted egg hides in the grass
oh whats over there
sophie appears spots the egg and delicately lifts it out of the grass
she holds it close to admire the intricate detail of its shell
sophie brings the egg to bunny for him to inspect
guardians screening script avid
thats a beauty
bunny takes sophie by the hand and leads her through a stone archway
now all we gotta do is get him and his little mates through the tunnels to the top and well have ourselves easter
bunny looks out proudly at the eggs gathered in front of the tunnels in the distance
jack approaches from behind and makes his way alongside bunny who holds sophie in his arms
its our first real vista of the whole warren
its a spectacular sight
sophie yawns and begins to fall asleep
bunny turns to jack with a smile
not bad yourself
look im sorry about that whole you know the kangaroo thing
its the accent isnt it
north comes up from behind with tooth at his side
they turn toward bunny marveling at the sight of sophie fast sleep
bunnys face softens as if remembering a distant memory
ah poor little ankle biter
look at her all tuckered out
i love her
they look up from the sleeping toddler toward jack
hes taught them something today
guardians screening script avid
i think its time to get her home
bunny hands the sleeping sophie over to tooth
how about i take her home
pitch is no match for this
twirls his staff which is why we need you here with us
the guardians look at jack with concern
trust me ill be quick as a bunny
jack tries to lay a sleeping sophie down in her bed but she wont let go of his neck
finally she releases her grasp only to roll over and fall out of bed
baby tooth gives jack a scornful look
is that you
jack and baby tooths eyes widen
sophie asleep on the floor is quickly covered with a blanket and given a squeaky stuffed animal
jack closes the window and looks to baby tooth with a sign of relief
we should get back
guardians screening script avid
baby tooth nods when
jack stops confused
where is that voice coming from
he looks out across the town toward the woods and the sound of the echoed voice
that voice i know that voice
baby tooth looks to him worried
with that jack leaps off the window ledge
jack carried by the wind flies across town toward the sound of the eerie voice
baby tooth follows trying to keep up
jack takes a moment to orient himself and lands settling on a rotating vent as the momentum slowly spins him around the voice calls out to him again
jack turns looks to the woods and takes off
jack and baby tooth land in the middle of a thickly wooded area
jack scans the forest when again he hears
jack gives chase
he sprints through the thickets and enters a clearing only to find the decrepit remains of a rotting frame from a childs bed
what would that be doing in the woods and how long has it been here
dont worry theres still time
guardians screening script avid
baby tooth desperately tries to get jacks attention by tugging at his tunic and tweeting desperately
jack takes his staff and breaks through the damaged frame revealing a hole leading deep underground
what to do
jack jumps down the hole reluctantly followed by baby tooth
jack continues along a long dark tunnel with baby tooth close behind
eventually the labyrinth opens up to reveal a huge underground cavern
baby tooth continues to tug at jacks tunic
waving baby tooth off baby tooth baby
i have to find out what that is
jack cant believe his eyes
dozens of huge bird cages hanging from the ceiling and in them are the mini tooth fairies
they see jack and immediately perk up tweeting and flitting like crazy
jack jumps up onto one of the cages then quickly leaps and holds onto the side of another one
keep it down
leaps to another cage im gonna get you out of here just as soon as i jack
jack turns away from the fairies distracted
guardians screening script avid
under his breath as i can jack looks down and sees the tooth drawers from tooths palace
mounds of them heaped to the ceiling
and inside the drawers are the missing baby teeth
he drops down to a mound and begins rummaging through the drawers looking at the names on the boxes
in an instant he forgets his duties and the fairies and the guardians and everything except those teeth and the chance to finally get his memory back
the cavern suddenly goes darker than it already was
jack finally looks up as a shadow of pitch crawls up a nearby column
looking for something
jack swings around with his staff shooting off a blast of ice but pitch isnt there
jack takes off following the sound of pitchs cackle as it echoes throughout the chamber
jack rounds a corner as he sees pitchs shadow glide across the walls into a shadowed corridor
dont be afraid jack
im not going to hurt you
jack continues along a shadowed corridor
jack sees pitch on a bridge across the cavern and heads after him
im not afraid of you
but you are afraid of something
jack steadily approaches cautious and alert
you think so huh
guardians screening script avid
i know so
its the one thing i always know
pitch finally turns to face jack
peoples greatest fears
yours is that no one will ever believe in you
panic flashes in jacks eyes
as he backs away the chamber fills with shadows and jack is spun around
hes disoriented as he thuds into a wall which flips to reveal that its actually the ground
pitch unseen now chuckles
jacks unsure of where he is
he looks back to see the cavern entrance hes right back where he started
and worst of all youre afraid youll never know why
why were you chosen
to be like this
jack discovers that the entrance has been blocked with bricks as pitchs shadow encroaches on him
well fear not for the answer to that
pitch is now directly in front of jack holding out a tooth box
is right here
jacks eyes widen at the sight the face of a young boy etched into the box and under it is the name jack frost
do you want them jack
he holds them out to jack
jack stares fighting the impulse to grab them
he closes his eyes struggling to make a decision but when he opens them again pitch has disappeared
pitchs shadow moves across the pillars of the cavern
guardians screening script avid
jack heads down a corridor cast shadows from the mini tooth cages everywhere
everything you wanted to know
pitchs face moves in and out of the shadows over the following
in this little box
every time jack turns pitch disappears
its like jacks trapped in a fun house
multiple pitch shadows have appeared on the wall around jack
theyre closing in on him
why did you end up like this
unable to reach out to anyone
you want the answers so badly
you want to grab them and fly off with them
but youre afraid of what the guardians will think
jacks breath quickens
hes been pushed into a corner
youre afraid of disappointing them
well let me ease your mind about one thing
theyll never accept you
the shadows have overcome jack
trying to scramble away stop it
almost reluctantly the shadows back away and pitch appears before jack
after all youre not one of them
jack aims his staff at pitch
you dont know what i am
guardians screening script avid
of course i do
youre jack frost
you make a mess wherever you go
why youre doing it right now
pitch tosses the box to jack who instinctively catches it
jack looks up
terror comes into jacks eyes as he realizes
what did you do
more to the point jack what did you do
pitch begins to back away becoming one with the darkness laughing as he disappears
jack charges towards him only to be swallowed whole by one of pitchs black holes
jack flies out of pitchs shadow ready to strike
suddenly jack realizes hes forgotten something
he turns to re enter the hole in the wall only to find himself face to face with one of bunnys stone emblems
happy easter jack
jack turns around
suddenly his eyes fill with dread as he realizes where he is
thousands of broken egg shells lay strewn about forming a path toward the light at the end of the tunnel
bunny peaks through the bushes to take in the scene an easter egg hunt
guardians screening script avid
there are no eggs
theres none anywhere
i give up
come on lets go
i dont understand
bunny checks the eggs in his basket then looks back toward the kids
maybe he just hid them really well this year
bunny egg basket in hand approaches a group of kids who seem to be wandering around searching halfheartedly disappointed and listless
i checked everywhere
steps towards them yes there is
i mean these arent my best lookin googies but theyll do in a pinch
he holds out a broken easter egg
the kids just stare
i cant believe it
theres no such thing as the easter bunny
the girl turns to leave
its only then that we realize hes too late
the spark of childhood has already been extinguished in all of them
guardians screening script avid
not not true
im right in front of ya mate
theres no such thing
the kids walk through bunnymund as if he were a ghost
bunny is stunned by this and finally realizes
now come on
i dont understand
why wouldnt he come
lets get out of here
easter bunny where are you
this is the worst easter ever
they dont see me
they dont see me
jacks watching this all unfold and its heartbreaking because he knows its his fault
tooth flies to bunnys side
jack hears a rustle in the bushes behind him
jack where were you
jack sees north with his scimitars drawn and having just come from battle
hes exhausted wild eyed distraught
the nightmares attacked the tunnels
they smashed every egg crushed every basket
nothing made it to the surface
tooth rejoins the group from off screen
where did you get that
jack looks down at the tooth box in his hand then back to tooth
guardians screening script avid
wheres baby tooth
oh jack what have you done
that is why you werent here
north steps forward to confront jack
you were with pitch
no listen listen
i didnt mean for this to happen
he has to go
jack turns to see bunny disheartened
we should never have trusted you
easter is new beginnings new life
easter is about hope
and now its gone
bunny turns away and moves toward the park looking at the sign that reads easter egg hunt
this is like a punch in jacks gut
he looks back to tooth and north both of whom look away too hurt by jack
he looks at them with a pained expression
this is exactly what pitch said would happen
jack reaches into his pocket pulls out the tiny russian nesting doll that north had given him drops the doll to the ground and takes off
as jack leaves carried off by the wind we see the tiny russian nesting doll laying on the ground
guardians screening script avid
jamie atop a ladder strains for what looks like an easter egg hiding in the rain gutter
the ladder totters and jamie loses his balance beginning to fall
whoaaa whoa whoa
jamie grabs the gutter but it breaks loose sending jamie crashing down into a mound of snow
as jamie gets up off the ground he sees that the easter egg was in fact a dirty old tennis ball
jamie stands up bewildered and dusts himself off as his friends laugh
a few have empty easter baskets
lets check the park again
for what the easter bunny
guys i told you i saw him
hes way bigger than i thought and hes got these cool boomerang things grow up jamie
ah man seriously
whats happened to you guys
it was a dream
you should be happy you still get dreams like that and not
they begin to turn away from him
guardians screening script avid
pippas the lone straggler
she looks tired depressed and hands jamie her basket as she leaves
forget it jamie
theres just no easter this year
i cant believe this
he really is real
pippa walks away trailing the others
jamie doesnt know what to believe
he hangs his head and looks into the easter basket its empty
i know he is
yetis stare at the globe of belief in shock as more and more lights begin to fad away
we push in toward antarctica as we jack runs to the edge of a floating iceberg ready to throw his tooth box into the ocean
he resists looking down at the box as he clutches it in his hand
hes never been more alone in his life
i thought this might happen
pitch is revealed standing not far behind jack
they never really believed in you
i was just trying to show you that
but i understand
guardians screening script avid
jack whips around and shoots a burst of frost at pitch but its quickly deflected by the nightmare sand
you dont understand anything
jack continues to attack lashing out with his staff
pitch blocks the attacks of ice and frost his control over the nightmare sand has gained considerable strength
i dont know what its like to be cast out
pitch strikes back putting jack on the defense
jack jumps in the air
their show of force escalates until theyre shrouded in a blanket of snow ice and wind
as the wind and snow settle jack looks around stern and alert
to not be believed in
to long for a family
jack turns around to find pitch
theres a look of compassion on jacks face as he listens
all those years in the shadows i thought no one else knows what this feels like
but now i see i was wrong
they lock eyes
a moment of true connection between them
we dont have to be alone jack
this isnt a trick pitch is making a real offer here
i believe in you
and i know children will too
look at what we can do
pitch gestures to a fantastical ice and nightmare sculpture that was created off screen when jack attacked him
guardians screening script avid
what goes together better than cold and dark
jack looks at the fractured reflections of themselves cast in the icy sculpture
we can make them believe
well give them a world where everything everything is
jack turns to face pitch
pitch realizing how this looks clarifies
and jack frost too
theyll believe in both of us
jack stares at him considering the offer
no theyll fear both of us
and thats not what i want
jack turns and walks away
now for the last time leave me alone
pitch looks confused and hurt
this is not the response he was expecting
his eyes flame with anger
he made himself vulnerable and jack rejected him
no more negotiating now
you want to be left alone
suddenly jack hears a familiar twitter
pitch reaches into his coat to pull out
jack charges forward
theres terror in baby tooths eyes
she squeaks as pitch clenches her tight with his fist
guardians screening script avid
the staff jack
jack settles and the winds and snow subsides
you have a bad habit of interfering
now hand it over
and ill let her go
twitters dont give it to him
baby tooth struggles to get loose but pitch only tightens his grip
she can hardly breathe
jack has no choice
pitch twirls the staff
re baby tooth alright now let her go
you said you wanted to be alone
so be alone
baby tooth squirms until shes finally able to peck pitch in the hand with her beak
pitch shrieks and throws baby tooth in the air and down into the mouth of a crevasse
jack enraged cant believe what hes seeing
pitch lifts the staff and breaks it over his knee cracking it in two
light explodes from the staff and terror comes into jacks eyes clutching his chest as if in pain
suddenly pitch sends a burst of nightmare sand blasting jack and slamming him into the iceberg wall behind him
as the ice cracks jack comes loose and falls forward into the chasm below
pitch looks down into the ice fissure chuckling
he throws the broken shards of jacks staff down into the crevasse and casually walks away disappearing on the horizon
guardians screening script avid
its cold and dark down here and jack is more alone than hes ever been
battered from the fall jack slowly looks up and notices baby tooth lying lifelessly on the ground
he pulls himself to her and cradles her in his hands
baby tooth nods but shes hurt and cold
jack does his best to shield her from the cold
sorry all i can do is keep you cold
jack sits up and holds baby tooth in his hands
pitch was right i make a mess of everything
jack is devastated
baby tooths never seen him like this its heart breaking
then she gets a thought
her expression hardens with determination
she wriggles deep into his pocket
jack leans back and begins to close his eyes when he hears jack
and then he feels something
looks down theres a soft golden glow coming from his pocket
jack jumps taken aback
he reaches in and pulls out the tooth box its pulsing with light
guardians screening script avid
baby tooth gives him a reassuring look
baby tooth motions to the box then looks back at jack
jack reaches to touch the box but as he does its top magically unfolds to reveal a handful of baby teeth then the box and everything else glows bright with
intense light the walls of the fissure seem to suddenly fall away
in brief flashes we see the colonial settlement jack visited
children running playfully down a hill
come on jack you cant have fun all the time
childrens laughing faces as a familiar boy hangs upside down from a tree limb
jack get down from there
a happy family at a roaring fire as the same boy jokes around with antlers on his head
youre funny jack
jack walks toward the woods with his sister
his mother face unseen calls out to him
jack shakes his head like hes heard it a million times but never pays it any mind
we are on an eye a familiar eye but this one is brown not blue
pull back to reveal young jack brown hair brown eyes
he is staring directly at the camera a look of
what is it
its hard to read but its very intense
we keep pulling back to reveal him dressed as we first saw him in th century clothes
behind him dark winter trees and snow come in to focus
guardians screening script avid
calm serious its okay
dont look down just look at me
jack reaches slowly down and removes the second of two rudimentary ice skates leaving him barefoot on the surface of a familiar frozen pond
and now we see what he sees a girl of about four with an uncanny resemblance to jamies sister sophie stands in her skates rooted to the spot
a spiders web of cracks emanates from where she stands
jack im scared
the ice below her splinters more
she wobbles as it starts to separate
i know i know
but youre gonna be alright
youre not gonna fall in
were gonna have a little fun instead
no were not
would i trick you
fighting back tears yes
you always play tricks
well not not this time
i promise youre gonna be
youre gonna be fine
jack fixes her gaze
theres nothing but the two of them
you have to believe in me
jacks sister pauses a moment then smiles through her fear
and just like that jacks demeanor changes
a light is switched on inside him and the last thing that could be happening is what is actually happening
guardians screening script avid
casual playfully you wanna play a game
were going to play hopscotch
like we play every day
jacks sister looks more reassured
its as easy as
and jack shows his sister the first leap but mugs for her almost losing his balance then catching himself
the next jump three
he turns toward her with his arms spread out
he reaches down to pick up a familiar looking stick lying on the ice
he extends it towards her now its your turn
jacks sister looks down
she is trying to gather her courage
jack never breaking his gaze with her one
she hops wobbling but catching her balance
thats it thats it
shes almost there jacks staff just beyond her reach
she grabs hold of jacks staff and in one massive effort he slings her with all his might to safety
but the movement propels him into the cracked ice
he looks up to see his sister safe smiles and then plunges into the dark cold water
guardians screening script avid
jack falls back into the icy water
were looking up at the hole in the ice descending into the dark icy depths
then the full moon appears from behind the clouds as jacks hands claw through the water towards it but its helpless
the moon glows bright
jacks body begins to glow bathed in moonlight
push in on his face becoming brighter and brighter until his brown hair turns white and jacks bright blue eyes flash open the icy walls rush back in as we
pull out from jack reeling from the memory
he sees baby tooth
did you did you see that
she shakes her head no tweets of course not
it it was me
i had a family
i had a sister
his excitement suddenly turns to realization
i saved her
he looks up at the opening above
the moon peeks out from behind the clouds
whispers up to manny thats why you chose me
im im a guardian
the moon seems to shine a little brighter
baby tooth tries to take flight but she sputters and lands back in the palm of jacks hand
guardians screening script avid
we have to get out of here
jack looks down at the two halves of his staff and picks them up
he tries to fit them back together but nothing happens
he tries again this time using every ounce of strength left in him
baby tooth watches her eyes widening as a spark of blue light shoots off the staff
jack continues to push until a the icy blue light spreads and melds the two ends of the staff back together
suddenly jack with baby tooth tucked safely in his tunic shoots up out of the fissure high into the sky and through the clouds
come on baby tooth
i owe you one
a series of quick cuts the mini teeth twitter as jack jumps from cage to cage opening them as he goes
jack opens another cage and notices the fairies standing still
come on lets go
jack looks around and notices that all of the minis are still in their cages
the fairies are just standing around listless
none of you can fly
baby tooth directs jacks attention to the globe at the base of pitchs lair
guardians screening script avid
a yeti very carefully sets the last of a group of newly painted red robot dolls on a shelf
he breathes a sigh of relief
suddenly the entire factory begins to shake knocking the robot doll to the ground
he dives after it juggles it in the air and catches it just before it hits the ground
suddenly streaks of black sand whoosh up into and around the factory
the dark sand snakes its way up and around the globe causing the yetis and elves to scatter and knocking toys to the floor
the yetis and elves look up in horror as the black sand now covering the globe gives rise to pitch who stands before them cackling
youre all free to go
we wont be needing any christmas toys this year thank you
nor ever again
the yeti with the robot dolls sinks his head and sighs in defeat
jack lands on the ground now standing before pitchs globe and it looks almost completely devoid of light
theyre all going out
pitch is practically dancing across norths globe hes so giddy counting down as the last few lights go dark
only six left
six precious children who still believe in the guardians with all their h a lights blinks out make that five
guardians screening script avid
his eyes widen as he snaps his fingers with anticipation and glee
all of his hard work and planning finally paying off
pitch stares down at the one last light waiting for it to go out
he snaps his fingers a few more times
his smile fades
his face goes cold as he realizes
jack jumps up onto the globe to closely inspect the last light
the light is brought into full view
were tight on the globe where the last light flickers
we push in to the light and
down onto the streets of burgess
we race over the town until we land on jamies house a single light shining from his bedroom window
jamie is sitting up in bed talking to an old stuffed rabbit and whispering
okay look you and i are obviously at what they call a crossroads so heres whats gonna happen jack appears outside jamies window and moves closer to get a better
if it wasnt a dream and if you are real then you have to prove it
like right now
guardians screening script avid
he looks around expectantly
jack looks on from outside the window wondering if anything will happen
desperation creeping in ive believed in you for a long time okay
like my whole life in fact
so you kinda owe me now
jamie picks up his stuffed rabbit and holds it close
you dont have to do much just a little sign so i know
anything at all
i knew it
jamie lets the stuffed animal fall to the floor
jack comes into the room and watches as the light slowly fades from jamies eyes disbelief setting in
jack doesnt know what to do
he takes a moment to concentrate then enters the room
then jamie notices the window as the panes of glass freeze over
the image of an easter egg suddenly appears
seeing the window huh
jamie looks down at the stuffed rabbit on the floor
he can barely comprehend what hes seeing
jamie looks back to the window as more of the window panes frost over
jamies eyes get huge with amazement
jack excited continues to exert himself trying to bring life to his drawing
and when he does the frost rabbit comes leaping off of the window
the rabbit hops around jamies room bursting like a snowball over jamies head the snowflakes sprinkling down on him
guardians screening script avid
jack is as amazed as jamie
but jamies amazement turns to confusion
a snowflake lands on the tip of jamies nose
the snowflake glows a magic blue
and in that moment a light comes into jamies eyes an idea starts to take hold
a stunned beat did he just say
jamie stands up on his bed
he said it again
he said you said
jamie turns around and suddenly his eyes go wide
but but thats me
thats my name
you said my name
jamies mouth drops open
only then does jack realize
wait can you hear me
can you see me
he sees me
he sees me
jack leaps for joy and the room suddenly explodes with snow
jamie cant believe it
guardians screening script avid
you just made it snow
in my room
who do you think brings you all the blizzards and snow days and you remember when you went flying on that sled the other day
that was you
that was me
but what about the easter bunny and the tooth fairy i mean real real real
every one of us is real
i knew it
jamies mom calls from down the hall
jamie who are you talking to
guardians screening script avid
a little chuckle okay
suddenly the sound of thunder and norths sleigh as jack and jamie look to the open window
whoa whoa whoa
north and tooth arrive on the sleigh completely out of control and crash land outside jamies house
the reindeer are separated from the sleigh and run into the woods
a disheveled tooth and north emerge from the wreckage
ah moi deti
as north stands his back suddenly gives out
are you okay
my powers are kaput
jack comes flying toward them
flies to him jack
tooth falters and falls to the ground
they greet each other with a smile as north draws near
guardians screening script avid
what are you doing here
same as you
jack looks off to the side as jamie appears from out of his backyard
the last light
to north and tooth wow
it is you
i mean it is you
i knew it wasnt a dream
he sees you
jack puts a protective hand on jamies shoulder
jamie looks up at him and smiles
jack and north exchange a look
wait but wheres bunny
losing easter took its toll on all of us
bunny most of all
jacks face goes pale
north lowers his head in sadness
then a twitchy nosed little bunny appears on the sleigh
thats the easter bunny
now somebody sees me
i mean where were you about an hour ago mate
what happened to him
he used to be huge and cool
and now hes cute
jamie gently tickles bunny under his chin
bunny begins involuntarily thumping his paw
oh thats good
guardians screening script avid
bunny catches himself and pushes jamies hands away
did you tell him to say that
hops over to jack thats it
me and you
actually he told me you were real
just when i started to think that maybe you werent
did he just hear that right
he made you believe
a moment of reconciliation between them broken by the sounds of thunder
the guardians look to the sky to see pitch enveloped by dark clouds as he stares down at them from atop a writhing mass of nightmare sand
to the others get jamie out of here
be careful jack
jack leaps into the air and goes flying directly at pitch
meanwhile the guardians take jamie to find shelter
his eyes flash with anger at see jack coming toward him
lets end this shall we
pitch sighs as he rolls his eyes and flies down to meet jack head on
jack sends a blast of ice and frost at pitch as he barrels toward him
pitch easily absorbs the attack with his nightmare sand
guardians screening script avid
that little trick doesnt work on me anymore
jacks plan backfires as pitch charges ahead and unleashes a roaring fury of nightmare sand that knocks jack out of the sky
jamie and the guardians do their best to avoid the patrolling nightmares
north struggles to keep up
quick this way this way
bunny leads them down an alley but its no use
other way other way
jack suddenly falls from the sky lands on a dumpster and falls limp to the ground
the others turn their attention and wince
they rush to jack and help him to his feet
that was good try jack
a for effort
groaning in pain hes stronger
i cant beat him
north and tooth trade looks of concern
then a menacing chuckle
the guardians keep a watchful eye as nightmare shadow streaks across the alley
all this fuss over one little boy
and still he refuses to stop believing
a crack of thunder reveals the shadow of an approaching nightmare as the sounds of hooves clacking against the ground echoes from the opposite end of the alley
guardians screening script avid
there are other ways to snuff out a light
bulbs start bursting as the arm of a shadow moves across the remaining lights in the alley
terror in jamies eyes
what does that mean
if you want him youre gonna have to go through me
with a finger raised the shadow arm glides along the floor curling around the back of bunny
laughing genuinely look how fluffy you are
would you like a scratch behind the ears
bunny jumps back into norths arms
dont you even think about it
pitch comes into view riding atop onyx
a gleeful smile strewn across his face
i cant tell you how happy it makes me to see you all like this
you look awful
they are weak and defenseless
but still the guardians gather around jamie to shield him from whatever may come
jack im scared
theres a sudden moment of realization
jack has heard these words before
jack im scared
we pan up from the ice to find his sister as he saw her in his memory
she is smiling
guardians screening script avid
i know i know
but youre gonna be alright
jack wide eyed
were gonnna have a little fun instead
thats my center
jamie gives jack a questioning look
what does jack have in mind
pitch gets closer
so what do you think jamie
do you believe in the boogiema
a snowball suddenly hits pitch in the face
two nightmares look at each unsure how to react
jamie cant help but snicker and north lets out a chuckle
jack looks around the alley
he spots a wooden crate a trash can lid and a discarded wok amidst a pile of trash
now lets go get your friends
pitch wipes the snow from his face and looks up to see a track of ice leading out of the alleyway
jack jamie and the guardians are gone
an aerial view of burgess
the streets are empty and the city is quiet
suddenly a streak of blue begins to materialize making its way through the tranquil suburb
a man walks his dog across an empty street when suddenly a cold wind blows behind him
jack and jamie come flying past leaving a trail of ice in their wake
and on that ice the guardians careen along in make shift sleds
they are scared and thrilled but theyre having fun
guardians screening script avid
a terrified cupcake lies in bed awake
the guardians reflections streak across the window when suddenly boof
a snowball strikes the pane of glass
cupcake pulls the covers down to find that its suddenly snowing inside
as the snow circles around cupcakes head she sits up and smiles
pippa sits in bed amazed as it snows in her room
she hears a knock at her window and moves toward it to find jamie floating outside
she throws open her window and looks down to the ground to reveal that they are two stories up
jamie how are you doing that
come on we need your help
jamie takes off flying down the street and as a snowflake lands on her nose she suddenly sees him
hey is is that
pippa looks up to see monty across the street with his head out the window and snow coming down in his room a gaping smile across his face
caleb and claude sit up in bed in amazement staring at the snowflakes as they stream down from the ceiling
guardians screening script avid
the twins look down to find neatly wrapped gifts at the feet of their beds as a jolly voice bellows in the distance
the twins open their window amazed to see their heroes sled past
dont forget to floss
caleb looks to his brother dumbfounded
suddenly cupcake skids past laughing and screaming on her own sled
and so it goes through the town
jamie you were right
the easter bunnys real
and the tooth fairy
theyre all real
guardians screening script avid
jack the guardians and the children all come to gliding halt on their sleds
they look up to see pitch standing atop a building with a confident smile while the clouds stir behind him
monty late to the party comes running joyously past jamie and the guardians who stand in silence as they stare up at the sky
sees pitch makes u turn ahhhhhhhhhhhh
you think a few children can help you
the nightmare sand storm descends from the sky
north draws his sword but the weight of the blade pulls him down
he can barely stand
jack moves to norths side as they look back to jamie noticing the concern on his face
theyre just bad dreams jamie
and well protect you mate
aww youll protect them
but who will protect you
jamie takes a moment to reflect while his friends look up at the sky in fear
jack looks down surprised to see that jamie has taken a position in front of him
suddenly jamies friends move to join him
guardians screening script avid
the guardians amazed watch as the kids squeeze past them
still think theres no such thing as the boogeyman
pitchs wave of nightmare sand snakes its way through town causing destruction wherever it goes and converges toward a single point as it heads straight toward the kids
i do believe in you
im just not afraid of you
jamie thrusts out his hand toward the nightmare wave
his friends follow suite just as the nightmare sand smashes into them
as it makes contact the black sand
bursts into streams of golden dreamsand
everyone is amazed hardly believing their eyes
streams of dreamsand swirl around the children
and then its pandemonium
the nightmares buck and jump as the sand makes its way past them
he watches aghast as his precious nightmares transform back into golden dreamsand and makes its way across town
tooth amazed watches as her wings suddenly flutter with a resurgence of strength and energy
she takes off and flies past the kids who cheer her on
yeah tooth fairy
norths eyes widen
he straightens his back and unsheathes his scimitars
guardians screening script avid
pitch gives a signal and sends another wave of nightmares toward the guardians
do your jobs
the petite rabbit looks at himself waiting to be transformed
oh yeah come on come on
when suddenly hes pursued by a snarling nightmare
bunny takes off running
north throws two snowglobes down to the ground through which an army of yetis and elves emerge
bunny tries to scurry under a parked car in order to evade the attacking nightmare but he is snatched by his tail before he can get away
im just a bunny
suddenly bunny transforms back to his normal size and whips out his boomerangs while being held upside down
guardians screening script avid
bunny kicks the nightmare flips into the air and throws his boomerangs which slice through two more nightmares turning them to dust
bunny drums his feet on the ground and an army of sentinel eggs suddenly rise up out of the earth
caleb finds himself riding on top of one as they join the yetis and elves in battle
elves riding toy ducks and planes come flying in overhead like bombardiers turning nightmares into puffs of black sand as they fly through them
the kids look to see a nightmare charging toward them only to stop in its tracks once the kids turn to face it
lets get em
the kids accompanied by two elves in a bike and side car charge an incoming nightmare
the elf behind the wheel lunges toward it biting at its haunches
come on guys we can do it
the kids put their hands on the nightmare turning it to dreamsand
pitch looks down with a smile at the chaos in the streets below
suddenly a thud
pitch turns toward the noise to see jack on the roof
guardians screening script avid
jack quickly sends a streak of frost toward pitchs nightmares disabling a few of them
the guardians turn toward the explosions of ice and snow taking place atop the surrounding buildings
pitch begins to charge and responds with an attack of his own
jack jumps to an adjacent roof and lets out another blast of ice
all yours mate
bunny taps his foot on the ground and creates a rabbit hole for north and himself to travel through
jack runs into pitch as he rounds the corner of a chimney
pitch lets a nightmare arrow fly which is suddenly deflected by tooth as she flies through the area and takes out a few nightmares of her own
suddenly bunny comes flying out of a nearby chimney drawing his boomerang as he lands
ho ho ho
guardians screening script avid
the nightmares surrounding pitch explode into dust as the boomerang tears through them
north shoots out of a bunny hole his scimitars at the ready only to have landed on a roof some distance from the guardians
pitch tries to escape the attacking guardians and slips into a nearby shadow emerging through the side of the building
north jumps off the roof to greet him mid air with his scmitars
pitch is knocked to the ground
as he gets to his feet he forms a scythe with his nightmare sand and begins crossing swords with north
in an instant pitch finds himself surrounded by the guardians
each of them take their turn to deal pitch a few humiliating blows
jamie looks over calebs shoulder as a wisp of dreamsand leaves his palms and rises into the air
look at that
gets an idea i got it
off their confused looks guardians screening script avid
i know what we have to do
guys come on
jamie leads his friends as they follow the streams of dreamsand down the street toward the growing mass of golden sand
the guardians advance toward pitch
its over pitch
theres no place to hide
pitch give them a wry smile and quickly descends into the shadows casting multiple versions of himself along the alley walls
suddenly in their moment of distraction pitch rises up behind jack his nightmare sand axe in hand
jack look out
the other guardians look on in horror as a golden whip wraps itself round pitchs hands
we follow the whip to reveal sandy coalescing from the funnel cloud of dreamsand
he gives pitch a look wags his finger and then uppercuts him into the air
sandy looks off to the side to where jamie and his friends have gathered
he forms a dreamsand hat and tips the cap to jamie
jamie gleeful waves back to sandy as his friends stand behind him in awe
man this is so cool
sandy then looks to his whip and tugs on it slamming pitch into the ground and knocking him out
the guardians cheer as they welcome sandys return
guardians screening script avid
welcome back old friend
sandy come here
mate you are a sight for sore eyes
sandy floats into the air and shoots streams of dreamsand in every direction
a wisp of dreamsand floats into a childs bedroom and touches his forehead while he sleeps
suddenly a dreamsand figure forms above the childs head its the tooth fairy
lights begin to appear on the globe
baby tooth notices this and perks up
her wings start to flutter
other fairies begin to fly
they shoot down to the tooth boxes and begin opening them
we see one of the faces on a box and transition to the actual child who she goes from sad to happy as her fondest memories flood back
we zoom out of her face to see thousands of fluttering fairies and
sophie peers out of her bedroom window watching as streams of dreamsand dance along the burgess skyline
guardians screening script avid
more and more windows begin to shine bright with gold as swirls of dreamsand fill the night sky
we pull back to reveal the globe in norths sleigh now decorated with spots of yellow light
a nightmare comes barreling towards cupcake
it screeches to a halt inches from the girls face
she gently taps the creature on the nose and turns into a dreamsand unicorn
a gigantic dreamsand dinosaur foot comes down revealing a dreamsand brontosaurus
as dreamsand creatures fill the streets the guardians and children rejoice
jamie stands in awe of a school of beautiful dreamsand fish as they float by
suddenly hes hit in the head with a snowball
he turns to look and sees jack smiling
jamie picks up a snowball and throws it at his friends
almost instantaneously a snowball fight ensures
bring it on
sandy salutes jack and north who are standing off to the side while the snowball fight escalates
it took awhile but i figured it out
north tosses jack a small item
jack catches it and looks to his open palm its a russian nesting doll in the image of jack similar to those found in norths workshop
jack smiles and north gives him a wink in return
guardians screening script avid
north is suddenly hit by a snowball and turns
he sees claude caleb and an elf they immediately point fingers at each other
a beat until north bursts out in laughter
youre all on naughty list
bunny think fast
he throws a snowball which hits bunny smack in the face
pitch groans in pain and rises up to see the town crawling with dreamsand creatures snowballs flying and yetis playing
he whips around to see the kids having the time of their lives and no fear in their eyes
he rises up his entire body shaking with rage and screams at them
you dare have fun in my presence
i am the boogeyman
and you will he lunges at jamie who come running toward him pitchs hands outstretched as if hes going to grab him by the throat
but jamie runs right through him laughing joyous
pitch gasps realizing that he no longer has any power over the children
the devastation plays across his face
under his breathe no
he sees the guardians approach standing side by side with one another
pitch turns and flees into the forest
guardians screening script avid
pitch runs through the shadows in terror
he comes crashing through the trees of the forest and out onto the ice of the pond
he looks over his shoulder to see if the guardians are on his tail when boom
he runs smack into norths chest
pitch slips on the ice and falls backwards
he looks up to see north smiling down at him
leaving the party so soon
you didnt even say goodbye
tooth tosses something to pitch which he catches
he looks down
its a quarter
a fist punches him right in the jaw and a single tooth goes skittering across the ice
tooth shakes out her hand
and thats for my fairies
you cant get rid of me
there will always be fear
as long as one child believes we will be here to fight fear
then what are they doing here
hundreds of nightmares emerge from the woods surrounding the pond
its terrifying but the guardians seem unphased
they cant be my nightmares im not afraid
looks like its your fear they smell
guardians screening script avid
suddenly pitchs eyes get huge with terror as the nightmares move in on him
he begins to back away but the nightmares pick up speed as they charge toward him
he tries to run but its impossible to get his footing on the ice
he falters and is swept up in the stampede of nightmares
the streaks of black whip and latch themselves onto pitch as the black cloud carries him through the forest
no no nooooooo
pitch struggles to escape but the mass of black sand pulls him deep into the forest under the frame of the broken bed and back down into the dark depths
of the underground
he looks up at the moon as he disappears and the hole in the earth seals itself up
pale and faint in the day but oddly close and welcoming
it cant be but is that the barest hint of a face on the moon
jack smiles as he looks up at it
he hears tooths laugh and turns to find north tooth bunny and sandy their faces shining with pride
tooth comes flying in to give jack a hug
she lifts him off the ground as they embrace
they share a moment and she soon recoils with giddy embarrassment as baby tooth interjects
jack acknowledges baby tooth and gently pats her on the side of her face as north steps forward
are you ready now jack
to make it official
jack looks over a stern elf is hitting a horn against his palm
a yeti hands north the book we saw when jack and the guardians first met
sandy and bunny share a boastful look
then is time you take oath
guardians screening script avid
north opens the book flips through several pages and takes a moment before he speaks
will you jack frost
vow to watch over the children of the world
jamie and his friends along with a crowd of yetis elves and eggs all make their way across the pond to the rest of the group
as they approach we see settle on jamie who stands at the center of the group
to guard them with your life their hopes their wishes and their dreams
for they are all that we have all that we are and all that we will ever be
jack takes a second to look back at jamie then back to north
then congratulations jack frost for you are now and forevermore
jamie and the kids erupt in a cheer as do the yetis and eggs
good job mate
guardians screening script avid
north picks up jack gives him a hug and kisses him on both cheeks
jack winces then looks up to north with a smile
thats my boy
imitating north an elf picks up the elf standing next to him and gives him a big kiss
after an awkward pause the affectionate elf is punched in the face
jack looks to see several fairies hovering nearby forming the shape of a heart
one of the swooning fairies faints and falls to the ground
keep it together girls
you did it jack
youre in the guardians
you earned it
youre jack frost
you guys look
thats santas sleigh
the group looks up to the sky as norths sleigh comes in for a landing
the tie dyed elf rescues a lone egg from the skis of the sleigh as it glides across the icy pond
wow its real
that is wicked
whoa that was awesome
can you believe this
whoa did you guys see that
guardians screening script avid
to north wryly everyone loves the sleigh

north turns away from bunny and puts his hand on jacks shoulder
time to go
as the kids look on in wonder sandy throws up his hands creating a shower of dreamsand which drifts down on the children
wow that was awesome
meanwhile bunny hands an egg to sophie who giggles and pats the brim of his nose
happy easter ya little anklebiter

bye bye bunny
jamie realizes whats about to happen
but what if pitch comes back
jack looks back at jamie who seems wistful and worried
what if we stop believing again
if i cant see you jack kneels down to look jamie in the eye
hey hey slow down slow down

guardians screening script avid
considers then no
okay well do you stop believing in the sun when clouds block it out

jack stands up and heads toward the sleigh
jamies friends stand off to the side rubbing their eyes as they become drowsy
i cant keep my eyes open
i think i gotta go home
lets go home
what time is it
jamie runs over and wraps his arms around jack
for a moment jacks astonished and then gives jamie a warm embrace
jack stands up and gets in the sleigh with the rest of the guardians
jack and the guardians look toward the kids as the sleigh takes off
jamie runs behind the sleigh following jack
in spite of it all he doesnt want to let go
the sleigh takes off into the sky
jamie stops unable to follow
guardians screening script avid
my name is jack frost
and im a guardian
how do i know that
because the moon told me so
and when the moon tells you something believe it
jack moves to the back of the sleigh as the guardians pat him on the back
and forms a snowflake in his hand
for jamie for all of us in the theatre
it glides off his fingertips and flies toward camera as we
