movie mewtwo strikes back this is not an official manuscript
this is a translation of an untranslated episode and is only released as a reference material to the pokemon series and games
all copyrights belong to nintendo game freaks and all creators of the movie opens when the camera is underwater
voice who am i
ive been dreaming about this world which doesnt exist in my memory
mew swims by who are you
am i apart of you
camera goes into a darker place with orange bubbles then it shows someones eye open
human figures are seen outside where he is
where is this
who am i
who brought me here
we now see who the voice belongs to its mewtwo
mewtwo who am i and why am i here
i just appeared here
i havent even been born to this world yet
who am i
mewtwo opens his eyes completely and shatters the glass and all the wires fall of him
scientist it has awakened
mewtwo did he do this
mewtwo has been completed
scientist thats you
we created you from a mew the rarest pokemon in the world
yes thats the pokemon which is said to be the most rare of all pokemon
is that my parent
scientist you can say that but not really
youve been made stronger based on a mew
mewtwo who is this
if neither my father nor mother
then was it god
did god create me
scientist in the world the only ones that can create new life is man and god
mewtwo who did this
humans made me
scientist this is truly a victory for science
another scientist with this weve proven our theory correct
we can continue the study
third scientist this place will become the new mecca
scientist all shaking hands im going to contact the other offices
mewtwo who am i
where is this place
what was i born for
mewtwo floats up and starts destroying the whole lab
then tons of little metal hand like things come down to stop him but he just blows them up
soon the whole lab is in flames
scientist to make the strongest pokemon ever
that was our dream
the whole lab blows up
giovanni the leader of team rocket comes down in a chopper and confronts mewtwo
mewtwo is this my power
im the strongest pokemon in the world
am i stronger then you
giovanni you surly are the strongest pokemon in the world
but there is another that would be the strongest
mewtwo the humans
giovanni nods if you and a human were to cooperate then the world would be ours
mewtwo the world would be ours
giovanni if your power is set free the world would be ruined
you must control your power
giovanni are you okay with destroying the world as it is with that power
mewtwo what should i do
mewtwo is at trhq getting loads of armor put on
mewtwo control myself with the armor that protects me
what are you going to make me do
giovanni its simple
all you have to do are the things everyone else has been doing
mewtwo and that is
giovanni fighting destruction and plunder
the stronger will win
mewtwo is sent into an arena to fight pokemon first an onix which mewtwo throws into a wall with his mind
then it shows mewtwo out in a field with a lot of wild tauros
he raises them up with his mind control and tr throws pokeballs out and catches them all
then it shows mewtwo in the gym again fighting alakazam mewtwo does just what he did to onix
then came electron and he used an electric attack and mewtwo reflected it back at him
next came garys arcanine and nidoking
he took care of them easily
next scene back in giovannis lab
mewtwo what am i fighting for
what am i living for
giovanni you are a pokemon
pokemon made by humans what else are you worth
mewtwo my worth
who am i
what do i live for
mewtwo starts breaking free of the wires giovanni what are you doing
mewtwo i was made by humans
but i who was created by humans am not even a pokemon
mewtwo blows up the place and flies off while all his armor slowly falls of into the sea
he lands on a rock
who am i
where is this place
who asked to make me
who wished to make me
i hate everything that made me
so this is neither an attack not a declaration of war but revenge on you who made me
introduction brock is cooking lunch for everyone
narrator ash and the others are on a journey training to be pokemon masters
its a beautiful day so they take a break in a field
ash is it ready yet
misty ash you can help too
ash i cant i cant even move one millimeter because im so starved
brock stew well and raise slowly
you mustnt be in a rush with both soup or pokemon
pikachu and togepy spot someone coming pirate hey you
the boy over there
are you ash from pallet town
ash thats right
pirate can i have a pokemon battle with you
ash runs over to him okay
i must have a solid fight
misty i thought you couldnt move one millimeter
ash just one or two pokemon fights before breakfast
brock this is lunch so that would be before lunch
has the japanese pokemon intro music through this battle the whole time
ash pulls out a pokeball and throws out bulbasaur
then the pirate throws out donfan
bulbasaur charges and donfan rolls into a ball and hits bulbasaur then turns around and hits him again
then he tries it again but bulbasaur uses solar beam and donfan faints
the pirate then sends out machamp
ash sends out squirtle
machamp kicks squirtle down and then goes to kick him again but squirtle dodges it and bubbles him till machamp faints
the pirate gets mad and throws pokeballs down
one is a venomoth another is a golem and the other is a pinsir
pikachu jumps off ashes shoulder and does thundershock and all faint
pirate oh my god
this was possibly the funniest part of the entire movie ash i did it
misty it was just because your opponent was weak
brock he didnt even raise them well flash to team rocket who is on a cliff watching our heroes
james pikachu gets stronger and stronger
jessie beautiful meowth we couldnt beat him even once
but the word surrender isnt in our dictionary
jessie i will get that pikachu
james but look at that
looks at them all eating meowth im so hungry
jessie i got a frying pan
meowth what good is such a thing without meat and vegetables
its just an iron board
a fearow with a camera flies over head then it shows inside some place where you can see ash and pikachu on the screens
lady are you sending them an invitation
dragonite flies out of the control center with a purse
it flies over the sees and then over team rocket and they fall then it flies over ash and everyones head knocking them all over then she lands
ash what are you
dragonite hands ash an invitation this
he hits a button and a hologram of the lady is displayed lady please forgive me for the abrupt letter
brock what a beautiful lady
lady since you are a promising pokemon trainer of the future wed like to invite you to a party of my master who is the strongest pokemon trainer in the
the place is the new island pokemon castle
please check the reply card for whether your coming or not
please accept the invitation for the strongest trainer in the world
brock beautiful lady
misty what do we do
brock lets go for it
we should go for it
ash i dont feel uncomfortable with being told im a promising future trainer
misty well then check yes on the card
they check yes and hand the invitation back to dragonite
dragonite takes the card and flies off but jessie james and meowth take out a net in an attempt to steal this rare pokemon
ashs invitation falls out of dragonites purse
jessie dont say goodbye without saying hello
meowth a post card
we see mewtwo waving his hand back and forth moving the clouds causing a big storm to start
we then see mew sleeping in a bubble underwater as the bubble floats to the top and pops mew wakes up and flies off
ash and everyone run out of the storm and into a ocean side house that has all the other trainers who were invited
a trainer calm down kingler
cut it out
our heroes run inside wet
ash it was a beautiful day
brock the weather along this beach can change easily
we notice a big crowd of trainers by the door and officer jenny standing with a woman talking to them all crowd huh
the ferry has been canceled
sweet we cant go to the new island
crowd oh no
we were invited to go
officer jenny be quiet everyone
here is the pier master
boijer im boijer
if you want to know about the sea ask the seagulls on the pier
no need to bother
just look at the flaw of the clouds
ive never seen such a hurricane in all my years
officer jenny is it that terrible
boijer i grew up on a port and ive never experienced such a storm
besides the storm is above new island offshore of this pier
i cant let you be placed in danger
thats my wish as the one who guards this pier
officer jenny as you heard the ferry has been cancelled
umio its okay with my pokemon
my pokemon are stronger in water
i can cross the sea
im the one who knows the sea and i say no
officer jenny shes right
besides if the pokemon were to get hurt now they wouldnt be able to get treatment at a pokemon center
ash what do you mean
officer jenny nurse joy at the pokemon center is missing
pokemon cant receive treatment without nurse joy
the poster over there is the missing person report brock looks at it brock beautiful
ive seen her somewhere before
some of the trainers go outside in the storm wanting to cross the ocean
soroa gets onto his pidgeot and flies off
umio gets on his gyarados and swims across
officer jenny stop
stop or ill arrest you
sweet gets on her dewgong and starts swimming away
boijer theres no use trying to stop them
after all theyre pokemon trainers
if they were children who would stop after being told to they wouldnt have gathered here
lets just pray for there safety
ash brock misty and pikachu run outside and see everyone leaving
ash across the sea lives the strongest trainer in the world
i cant cop out now
misty but we cant cross this sea using our pokemon
a small wooden ship pulls up with people in it
jessie want a ride
not saying that its free but depending on the situation
i might allow you onboard
they get on and start going and meowth is dressed like a girl in front of the boat then a huge wave and team rockets costumes fall off
then the waves start getting really rough
ash you guys
you guys again
brock you guys appear at the very worst times
ash what do you want
jessie if were asked what we want
james the answer to that is
meowth theres no time for saying that
a huge wave flips the boat
misty shoots out staryu and swims to the surface
misty comes up and he grabs onto staryu
misty where is ash and pikachu
a big wave comes again and they go back under and see as h swimming up with squirtle
ash hold on tight everyone
squirtle and staryu keep swimming under the waves until they see light
then it shows mew flying above the clouds
ash and everyone get to the castle and climb out of the water and the mysterious lady is standing there
lady welcome to the new island
please show me your invitation
ash hows this
he shows her
b rock that was you just as i thought
brock that picture of nurse joy i saw in the missing person report at the pier was you
misty that reminds me she looks like her
lady i dont know what your talking about
ive been serving this castle ever since i was born
come this way
the other guests are already waiting
they go inside and team rocket floats up from the water on top of weezing
then it shows mew playing with the windmill on top of the castle
meanwhile ash and everyone are inside the castle
lady those are the trainers who have already arrived
lady the trainers who couldnt cross that storm arent worth inviting
brock so then you tested us
lady please take out the pokemon from the pokeballs and be seated
you are the chosen trainers
james outside and the front door shuts well then lets sneak into this castle
jessie the only way is to use the exit
meowth wheres the exit
jessie over there
meowth the s
im not a brown rat
jessie dont complain
all of a sudden mew comes down from behind tr and looks at them
jessie turns her head but mew disappeared
james whats wrong jessie
jessie nothing lets go
sorao you came too
sorao i flew here
my pidgeot can cross such a hurricane in one flight
everyone greet them
all his pokemon say their names then they see a gyarados
umio thats my gyarados
i rode him across the sea
those kind of waves are nothing for it
ash gyarados is a brutal pokemon isnt it
umio yeah but if you can handle it no one is more reliable
sweet my pokemon are just the same over there
points to her blastoise wigglytuff and more
then all the lights turn off there is a bright beam of light coming down the center of a huge spiral staircase
lady that you for waiting everyone
the strongest pokemon trainer is coming
all of a sudden mewtwo starts floating down and all the pokemon get worried
lady yes this is the strongest pokemon trainer and strongest pokemon
the lights come back on and everyone can see him clearly
umio a pokemon is a pokemon trainer
it cant be
it becomes apparent that mewtwo is telepathically controlling joy
mewtwo ive decided my own rules
misty that voice
mewtwo raises umio up in the air and throws him into a pool using his mind umio darn it
gyarados attacks with hyper beam it goes to mewtwo and mewtwo stops it and turns it around and it hits gyarados causing it to faint
mewtwo that was easy
looks at joy i no longer have any need for you anymore
joy faints into brocks arms brock nurse joy
nurse joy where is this place
why am i here
mewtwo to make you take care of me i took you from the pokemon center
a doctor who is familiar with pokemon is convenient
you were quite useful
you dont remember anything though
brock what did you say
mewtwo humans can be manipulated in any way with my power
misty with what power
pikachu meanwhile tr are in the castle and they find a strange room and they enter it
meowth what is this place
they look and see a charizard venusaur and a blastoise in big glass test tubes sleeping
james is it really
jessie these arent like any treasures ive seen
jessie walks away and sits on some button and a computer turns on with a very fuzzy screen
computer our study
to continue in our research
we would have to collect samples from our test subjects
all of a sudden something grabs meowth and throws him in a machine meowth jessie meowth
both jessie and james start pull to get meowth out and they do get him out but not before the machine got hairs from off of his tail
on the computer screen a figure of a meowth shows up and the computer starts saying some weird stuff then in an empty test tube next to team rocket a
meowth falls down from a pipe into it all of tr meowth i am meowth
james then this is
mew appears behind team rocket again
computer but the copy we created is more than weve imaged
the pokemon which we found
in the depths
its name is mew
we succeeded in finding fossilized eye lashes of a mew
from the gathered components we created mewtwo with this machine
the goal was to make the strongest pokemon with our own hands
that was our dream
but soon mewtwo displayed unmeasurable violence
its all over
the research office will be destroyed
the only way left to abandon this place and escape
the computer shuts off jessie this is the research office
james i think so
meowth yeah james but theres nothing wrong with it
jessie or maybe something created it again
james but who
mewtwo i thought of working with humans once
but i was disappointed
humans are the worst creatures inferior to pokemon
if creatures that are weak and cruel like humans control this world this planet will come to ruin
brock are you saying like your gonna rule it
mewtwo shakes his head pokemon are no good either because this planet is ruled by humans our pokemon
pokemon who lived for humans
mewtwo what did you say
youre not being controlled
youre with the humans because you want to be
to be with them by itself is wrong
mewtwo lifts pikachu up with his mind and throws him but ash jumps back and catches him
mewtwo weak pokemon rely on humans
are you ok
how dare you attack pikachu
soroa we can get him no matter what kind of pokemon he is as long as hes a pokemon go ryhorn
ryhorn charges at mewtwo and is inch from him and mewtwo stops him and raises him into the air and shoots ryhorn across the room
mewtwo its no use
i was born as the strongest of any pokemon in the world
ash you dont know that before we try
mewtwo you wan to try
ash we can ask for nothing better
mewtwo eyes start glowing then it shows in the lab with team rocket in it charizard venusaur and blastoise come out of there test tubes and walk out the door
then mew flies out with them
james was that a
mewtwo any human who are aiming to be pokemon trainers go first
charizard blastoise venusaur
the copies raise up from the ground
these are the evolved forms of the copies ive made
soroa they are
everything starts shaking and a huge door opens and inside is a pokemon battle field
brock a battle field
is he going to have a pokemon battle
soroa ive got venusaur for that copy one
sweet ive got blastoise for that copy one
ash ive got charizard too
charizard i chose you
charizard comes out and gives mewtwo and evil look then shoots fire out at him but mewtwo makes a force field around him so it doesnt even touch him
charizard thats a surprise attack
mewtwo shoots up water and the fire goes out
mewtwo what a bad tempered charizard
so whos first
soroas venusaur walks out
soroa i was careless before but it wont go that way this time
the copied venusaur walks out
mewtwo vine whip
copied venusaurs vines chop up the razor leafs then his vines wrap around venusaur and tosses him across the room
sweet im next
mewtwo points for copied blastoise to go
sweet blastoise hydro pump
copied blastoise spins right threw the water and hits blastoise causes him to go crashing hard into the wall
misty be careful ash
his skills are strong
ash i know
mewtwo signals copied charizard to go
lets fight with speed not power
both charizard fly up
ashes charizard keeps using flame thrower but copied charizard dodges them all and keeps hitting charizard in the stomach
misty where are the speed attacks
brock the enemy is to fast
copied charizard grabs charizard and starts flying down to the ground
mewtwo dive bomb slam
charizard hits into the ground then gets up
ash runs out to charizard hold on charizard
are you okay
mewtwo both speed and power are lacking
mewtwo then throws his hands up and black pokeballs appear he shoots them all out and captures sweets blastoise another gets soroas venusaur and the other captures ashes charizard
a small gold statue lifts up and the balls shoot down into the hole
ash misty are you taking the others pokemon
mewtwo taking them
im going to make stronger copies than the pokemon you are so proud of
mewtwo raises his arms again and hundreds of black pokeballs appear
its suitable enough for me
thats a violation of the rules
mewtwo dont tell me what to do
mewtwo looks at ash and throws him into brock ive decided my own rules
mewtwo drops his arms and all the black pokeballs start flying everywhere brock theyre coming
ash run everyone
the pokeballs are everywhere catching the trainers pokemon the gyarados was caught then the golduck then seaking then scyther then hitmonlee then sandslash the trainers are trying to protect there
pokemon but there is nothing they can do
then dewgong was caught then rapidash then vileplume
then bulbasaur and squirtle are fighting them off then wigglytuff was caught then pidgeot and when they get caught the pokeballs fly back into the whole under the statue lifted
up in the air
ash ive got it
take your own pokemon back to your own pokeballs
return squirtle and bulbasaur
they both go back into their pokeballs mewtwo its no use
black pokeballs go to ash open and capture the pokeballs bulbasaur and squirtle are in
nothing is impossible with the black pokeballs i have made
misty puts togepy in her bag and shuts it tight while brock holds vulpix close
nurse joy this place is no good
lets run outside
nurse joy psyduck misty and brock start running but then a black ball catches psyduck misty my psyduck
a black ball catches vulpix
pikachu is being hunted down by tons of black pokeballs
then pikachu falls and is about to be caught
but ash jumps in front of him and the pokeballs hit him
ash run pikachu
pikachu is running and starts climbing the spiral stairs with ash running after him
pikachu keeps using thundershock to blow up all the pokeballs around him but more keep coming
ash starts running up the stairs a little behind pikachu dont give up pikachu
pikachu gets tired and he accidentally falls of the stairs
ash jumps after him and is about to grab him but then a black pokeballs snatches pikachu
but ash catches the pokeball and then falls into some water but when he does the pokeballs slips out of his hands and goes into the hole
since it was the last pokemon the statue starts to drop but ash just barely makes it and jumps down into the hole after the pikachu in the ball
team rocket is still in the lab which is where all the copies are going
they are amazed at all the copies dropping into all the test tubes everywhere but then ash falls down chasing after pikachu
ash im sorry i dont have time to deal with you today
ash jumps and grabs pikachus pokeball but right when he does about little metal mini hand like things come down trying to keep pikachu ash is fighting off the mini
let it go
let him go
let go of my pikachu
all the hands break and the whole copy machine starts blowing up and pikachu comes out of his ball
but then all the copy pokemon start coming out of there tubes because the whole copy machine is all blown up
all the copies start walking out of the room
jessie oh no
there coming out
meowth my copy to
ash those are all copies
jessie where are they all going
all of a sudden theres an explosion and all the black pokeballs come out and all the original pokemon come out
james the real ones have come out to
of the black balls open and normal pokeballs come out then those open and squirtle and bulbasaur come out
ash and pikachu runs over and starts laughing and hugging each other then ash stops and looks up and looks angry
meanwhile up stairs
mewtwo humans i wont take your lives too
the doors open to the exit
mewtwo that is if you an make it out in that storm
then there is an explosion and all the copied pokemon come walking out
mewtwo what happened here
from the smoke ash and all the original pokemon come walking out
ash i can not forgive
i will not forgive you
misty brock ash
misty sees psyduck psyduck
brock sees vulpix vulpix
mewtwo did you set them free
ash i will protect my pokemon my friends
ash charges at mewtwo and goes to punch him but mewtwo throws him down to the ground
ash gets up and tries again and mewtwo lifts him up
mewtwo throws ash into a huge statue but just as hes about to hit it which we know would really hurt a pink bubble stops him and ash bounces a
few times on that
mew flies up to ash and stares at him ash then looks at mew and mew pops the bubble and ash falls only like a foot then mew starts giggling
mew makes another bubble and starts jumping up and own on it giggling and having a good time then mewtwo makes a black electric ball and shoots it up and
it pops mew bubble
mew turns around and looks at mewtwo confused
mewtwo makes another and blows up when it hits mew
mewtwo makes more and throws them all up at mew mew dodges them all and starts giggling again
mew flies down and looks at mewtwo mewtwo mew
the pokemon thats supposed to be the rarest pokemon in the world
mew looks around at everyone
i love this guy
mewtwo i was made from you
but i am the stronger one
i am the true one
mew is still looking around acting like its paying no attention to mewtwo
brock mew and mewtwo
sweet mewtwo was made from mew
mewtwo starts glowing i am the only one who will survive
mewtwo starts chasing mew everywhere shooting tons of those black electric balls at him
but mew keeps running away dodging everything
mewtwo who dont you want to fight
the reason why you avoid fighting is because your afraid of me
mewtwo makes another black electric ball and shoots it at mew and knocks mew right in the face and mew goes flying in the distance
everyone is then shocked but then the same type of ball only blue comes back and hits mewtwo and he goes into a wall
mew flies back down
and mewtwo floats up from the fire and rubble
tr enters the room
mewtwo your attacks are ineffective against me
now is the time to decide which one of us is the true one you the copy
which is the stronger
we were made stronger than the real ones
mew mew mew
mew mew mew
mew mew mew meowth i see
jessie what is it saying
meowth the real one is real
if they fight only using bodies without skills
the true ones will not be beaten by their copies mewtwo the real one is real
mewtwo shoots another black electric ball at mew but mew dodges it and just barely misses ash
ash then starts climbing down the statue
lets decide which is the real one without skills
youre the stronger ones go
all the copies start attacking their originals
the copies are winning
mewtwo makes a visible blue force field around himself
mew does the same except its pink and they fly up high in the air and keep ramming into each other
then pikachu is looking around at the big copy war then he sees his copy standing there ready to fight him
pikachu cant believe it
nurse joy what is this fighting
both the real ones and copies are alive now
sweet everyone is a living thing brock though they were created there are living beings that live in this world
misty the real ones and the copies
but both of them are the same living things
theres no such thing as a win and losing
james if we were asked that i wouldnt know what to say jessie i feel so sorry james theyre bullying themselves
jessie its like seeing what we used to be
james its like seeing what we are now
both feels bad
meowths copy walks up to meowth
meowth its you
they take out there claws and are ready fight this is gonna hurt
but every pokemon is fighting each other youre unfair
copy meowth meow meow
im more unfair
its because im not fighting with you
your nails would hurt more wouldnt they
copy meowth meow meow meow meowth you said tonights moon would be round
youre right it must be a full moon
copy meowth meow meow meowth talking about the moon at a time like this is tasteful
meanwhile mew and mewtwo are still bouncing around fighting
and ash finally makes it back to the ground
ash looks at everyone fighting and getting so tired thats enough
ash ive got to stop them
the battle will continue unless mew and mewtwo stop fighting
nurse joy animals dont hand over there territory to the same type of animal
misty oh no
nurse joy they will fight until they drive their opponents away
that is the way of living beings
brock that may be for living beings but mewtwo was made by humans
misty but now hes a living being
ash now they are all living beings
mew and mewtwo pikachu and that other pikachu
mew and mewtwos fight finally goes on ground and they both take off there force field
mew and mewtwo both shoots a beam out at each other and starts to run between them not seeing the beams coming
both beams hit ash and he falls to the ground and turns to stone
mewtwo it cant be
a human tried to stop our fight
pikachu runs out to ash and starts shaking ash
then he thunder shocks him many times and ash still doesnt move
pikachu begins to cry
then all the other pokemon look at pikachu including the copies and they start crying
all there tears float over and land on ash then last pikachus tears fall onto ash and ash regains his hold on life and turns back to flesh from rock
pikachu pika pi
mewtwo actually both you and i are pokemon that already exist
mewtwo it might be better if no one knows about us or any of this
mew and mewtwo start flying away and then all the copies pokemon lift up into the air and fly with them
ash why are you going everyone
mewtwo flying away with all the copies we were born and alive
we will continue to live somewhere in this world
all of a sudden the whole castle fills up with bright light and everyone disappears
now we are back where all the trainers what to go on the ferry
officer jenny the ferry has been canceled
theres a hurricane coming
nurse joy walks through the crowd dont worry everyone
im going to open the pokemon center as a shelter
