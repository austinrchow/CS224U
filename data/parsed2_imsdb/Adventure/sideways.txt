screenplay by alexander payne jim taylor based on the novel by rex pickett may knocking at a door and distant dog barking
now under black a card the rapping at first tentative and polite grows insistent
then we hear someone get out of bed
a door is opened and the black gives way to blinding white light the way one experiences the first glimpse of day amid say a hangover
a worker is there
can you move your car please
the painters got to put the truck in and you didnt park too good
a sigh then yeah hold on
he closes the door with a slam
wearing only underwear a bathrobe and clogs miles raymond comes out of his unit and heads toward the street
he passes some six mexicans waiting to work
he climbs into his twelve year old convertible saab parked far from the curb and blocking part of the driveway
the car starts fitfully
as he pulls away the guys begin backing up the truck
miles rounds the corner and finds a new parking spot
he cuts the engine exhales a long breath and brings his hands to his head in a gesture of headache pain or just anguish
he leans back in his seat closes his eyes and soon nods off
the door bursts open
miles runs into the kitchen looking just past camera
the microwave clock that reads
miles hurriedly throws clothes into a suitcase
yeah no i know i said id be there by noon but theres been all this work going on at my building and its like a total nightmare and i
had a bunch of stuff to deal with this morning
but im on my way
im out the door right this second
its going to be great
miles has a book propped open on his knees
he turns a page lost in his reading
miles finally makes it to the front of the line
triple espresso please
rough night huh
ringing it up for here
no im running late
make it to go
and give me a new york times and
scanning the display case a spinach croissant
miless saab chugs up the ramp and merges
pressed against the steering wheel
the puzzle is about finished
as though from an adjacent car we see miles driving while carefully filling in an answer
a sign reads pan to miles as he signals to change lanes
the finished puzzle lies on the passenger seat
the houses on this block are blandly palatial as in so many affluent southern california suburbs
miless car pull into the driveway behind an older bmw and two lexi
he gets out and trots toward the front door
in a large split level living room displays a golf tournament
watching from the ultra comfortable furniture are mike erganian a tanned silver haired real estate caudillo bride to be christine erganian his oldest daughter and jack lopate wearing bowling shirt
shorts and flip flops
erganian a warm and elegant housewife shows miles into the room
look what the cat dragged
erganian and jack get to their feet and shake hands with miles
jack remains affable but we can discern his genuine irritation
about time you got here bud
we were thinking maybe you took the wrong way and went to tijuana and they didnt let you back in
the erganians laugh
miles works up a smile too
i had to bribe them
more lame laughter
leaning in to kiss christine seriously though the freeway was unbelievable today
bumper to bumper the whole way
people getting an early start on the weekend i guess
granted i got a late start but still
erganian presses mute on the remote he keeps watching for an extended moment as do jack and miles
christine why dont you ask miles about the cake
oh good idea
here miles come to the kitchen with me
dont bother him with that
we got to get going
taking miless hand itll just take a second
jack and the erganians surround miles as he eats from a plate with two pieces of cake one white one dark
jack tells us you are publishing a book
miles shoots jack a look
erganian gets some ice cubes from the refrigerator door
yeah well its not exactly finalized yet but um there has been some interest and to jack your friend is modest
yeah miles dont be so modest
dont make me out to be a liar
what subject is your book
no its a novel
although theres a lot from my own life so i guess technically some of it is non fiction
good i like non fiction
there is so much to know about the world that i think reading a story someone just invented is kind of a waste of time
so which one do you like better
i like them both but if pressed id have to say i prefer the dark
to christine see
the erganians wave good bye
miles accelerates as he and jack wave back
where the fuck were you man
i was dying in there
we were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now
i cant help the traffic
youre fucking hungover
okay there was a tasting last night
but i wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up
check out the box
jack turns around and starts rooting around in a cardboard why did you tell them my book was being published
you said you had it all lined up
no i didnt
what i said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at conundrum
and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor
she was supposed to hear something this week but now its next week and
its always like this
its always a fucking waiting game
ive been through it too many times already
i dont know
sounds like youre in to me
its a long shot all right
and conundrum is just a small specialty press anyway
im not getting my hopes up
ive stopped caring
ive stopped caring
jack sits back in his seat holding up a bottle of champagne and two glasses
but i know its going to happen this time
i can feel it
this is the one
im proud of you man
youre the smartest guy i know
jack now begins to remove the foil from the champagne bottle
dont open that now
come on were celebrating
i say we pop it
thats a byron
its really rare
dont open it now
ive been saving it
jack untwists the wire
instantly the cork pops off and a fountain of champagne erupts
for christs sake jack
you just wasted like half of it
jack begins pouring two glasses
handing miles a glass heres to a great week
coming around yes
despite your crass behavior im really glad were finally getting this time together
you know how long ive been begging to take you on the wine tour
i was beginning to think it was never going to happen
they clink and drink
oh thats tasty
they dont even make it anymore
how come its white
doesnt noir mean dark
dont ask questions like that up in the wine country
theyll think youre a moron
just tell me
color in the red wines comes from the skins
this juice is free run so theres no skin contact in the fermentation ergo no color
not really listening sure is tasty
the saab heads north
the boys continue to drink and drive
did you read the latest draft by the way
i liked it a lot
a lot of improvements
it just seemed overall i dont know tighter more
congealed or something
how about the new ending
did you like that
there is no new ending
page on is exactly the same
well then i guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different
miles is pumping gas
jack is stretching his legs nearby or perhaps cleaning the windshield
a cellphone rings
jack reaches into his pocket
looking at the phone its christine
snapping it open hey you
you guys having fun
christines voice is so loud that jack has to hold the phone away from his ear
all twenty minutes so far have been a blast
a silence then so whats up
just seeing how youre doing
and um mom and i were starting to look over the seating charts again and were wondering if you wanted tony levin to sit next to the feldmans or should
he be at one of the singles tables
jack looks at miles in a mute appeal for sympathy
so what do you think
with the feldmans
jack hasnt even really heard the question
as the conversation continues miles replaces the gas pump screws the gas cap back on and together the guys get back into the car
we drive away with them
because i dont know i was thinking that well then put him at the singles table
the problem with that is that then theres one extra then put him with the feldmans
whatever you and your mom decide is fine with me
dont dismiss me
im trying to include you in this decision
hes your friend
i didnt dismiss you
i told you what i thought but it didnt seem to matter so you decide
besides this is supposed to be my time with miles
i hope youre not going to call every five minutes
im not going to call every five minutes but this is important
honey im just saying you know i need a little space before the wedding
isnt that the point of this
isnt that what we talked about with dr
then why are you being so defensive
i dont know christine
perhaps its because i feel attacked
i ask you one simple question and suddenly im attacking you
ill call you when we get there and we can talk about it then okay
i love you
jack slams his cellphone shut momentarily blinded with rage
why did you fucking invite tony levin
the saab heads north now passing through los angeles
miles signals and begins to head for an exit
whoa why are we getting off
ive just got to make one quick stop
wont take a second
i thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother
jesus miles we were supposed to be up there hours ago
its her birthday tomorrow
and i dont feel right driving by her house and not stopping in okay
itll just take a second
shes right off the freeway
the saab takes an exit
how olds she going to be
thats a good age
the saab rounds a corner and parks in front of a modest condo
approaching the front door miles pulls a bouquet of flowers out of a plastic grocery store bag
jack carries a bottle of miles pulls a birthday card out of the bag too
wait a second
he pulls a pen from his pocket and signs it
as he licks the envelope jack rings the bell
moments later phyllis comes to the door
she is a matronly older woman in a nightgown and housecoat
the boys offer up the flowers and champagne
phyllis slurs slightly as she speaks shes been doing some celebrating of her own
what a surprise
i cant remember the last time you brought me flowers
theyre from both of us
a famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday
dont i feel special
a famous actor whos getting married next week
oh thats right
isnt that nice
i hope that girls knows how lucky she is marrying no less than derek summersby
the boys follow her inside
raymond that was eleven years ago
well you were wonderful on that show
i never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon
why that didnt make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin
its a sin
yeah well you should be my agent
if i was i would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin
now miles why didnt you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man
look how im dressed
ive got to run and put my face on
you look fabulous mrs
over her shoulder oh stop it
make yourselves comfortable
now around the corner you boys hungry
yeah im hungry
jack gives miles a look
low just a snack
miles leads jack into this small condo
the tv is on and its messy
amid the newspapers and junk mail and dishes an ab roller and an ancient schwinn exer cycle sit forgotten in a corner
miles finishes twisting ice trays into a mop bucket as it fills with water in the sink
he puts the champagne in and carries it into the he takes a seat on the sofa next to jack who is watching let me show you something
the secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released you keep pressure on it so you dont concentrated on the just a second
guys going for
miles finishes opening the bottle with an elegant silence
ready for my close up
the boys turn to see phyllis now dolled up in thick make up and a pantsuit
her eyebrows are painted and cock eyed
overall she looks much worse than before
miles why dont you bring that out onto the lanai
i thought we could eat on the lanai
miles and jack are seated in webbed chairs around a circular glass table
they are mid meal
everyone is more than a little lubricated especially the birthday girl as she returns from the kitchen with another plate of food
raymond this is delicious
sitting theyre just leftovers
is it chicken
i could have made something fancier if a certain someone had let me know that a certain someone was coming for a visit with a certain special friend
could have made a pork roast
it was a surprise mom
and i could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold out
you are staying
wendy ron and the twins are picking us up at to go to brunch at the sheraton
they do a magnificent job there
wendy is so excited youre coming
jack freezes his fork halfway to his mouth
you talked to wendy
and the kids
trying to be chipper yeah well
you know jacks pretty eager to get up to
you know but uh yeah
well see how it goes
well you boys do what you want
i just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday
wiping his mouth ill be right back
he gets up and heads into the house
miles heads toward
and goes directly to her dresser opening a drawer filled with bras panties and stockings
he burrows through his mothers lingerie until locating a can of raid
a can of raid
he twists open the bottom and pulls it apart revealing it to be a secret stash for valuables disguised as a common household product
inside are stacks of one hundred dollar quickly peeling some off six seven eight
one more for good luck nine
his task complete he closes the drawer and as he stuffs the bills in his pocket his glance falls upon framed photos atop the dresser a proud nine year old
miles poses in front of his childhood san diego home showing off a wagon filled with freshly harvested lettuce
on the wagon is a hand lettered sign cents a bunch
a sears portrait shows the raymond family a much younger phyllis her husband and their two children a year old miles and seven year old wendy
miles at his wedding
he and his bride victoria look young and attractive their faces radiant and hopeful
miles enters flushes the toilet and leaves
as miles slides open the door and takes his seat again jack is pouring phyllis another glass
and what was that other one you did the one where youre the jogger
oh that was for uh wait
that was for spray and wash
spray and wash
thats the one
yeah i remember the girl who was in it with me
she was something
i just remember you jogging
so whens the wedding
irritated this saturday mom remember
we told you
and miles is my best man mrs
my main man
another drink of wine miles when are you going to get married again
i just got divorced
two years ago buddy
you should get back together with victoria
she was good for you
embarrassed for his friend jack just stares at his food
she was good for you
turning to jack and so beautiful and intelligent
you knew her right
im worried about you miles
do you need some money
miles takes another drink of wine
under black a card jack
jack finally awakens with a start and finds miles standing above him shaking him
as jack gets up we see he has crashed on phylliss bed adorned with all her decorative pillows
still in her pantsuit and smeared makeup phyllis lies sprawled and snoring on the sofa
on the tv ostensibly never turned off the night before is an inane cartoon
as miles opens the front door he spots jack heading toward the tv to turn it off
miles waves him off
a loud whisper shell wake up
as they leave and miles closes the front door quietly behind him we pan to the flowers still wrapped and forgotten on a side table
two plates of food float in front of two breasts tucked inside a zippered uniform
disheveled and unshaven jack and miles are served breakfast by a young innocently sexy waitress
jack leers after her
too early in the morning for that you know what i mean
shes a kid jack
i dont even look at that stuff anymore
thats your problem miles
as if shed even be attracted to guys like us in the first place
speak for yourself
i get chicks looking at me all the time
its not worth it
you pay too big a price
its never free
they eat in silence a moment
you need to get laid
miles shrugs off the comment
itd be the best thing for you
you know what
im going to get you laid this week
thats going to be my best man gift to you
im not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit
id rather have a knife
youve been officially depressed for like two years now and you were always a negative guy anyway even in college
now its worse youre wasting away
teaching english to fucking eighth graders when they should be reading what you wrote
im working on it
miles concentrates on his eggs and hash browns you still seeing that shrink
i went on monday
but i spent most of the time helping him with his computer
well i say fuck therapy and whats that stuff you take xanax
and lexapro yes
well i say fuck that
you need to get your joint worked on thats what you need
this week is not about me
its about you
im going to show you a good time
were going to drink a lot of good wine play some golf eat some great food enjoy the scenery and send you off in style
and get your bone smooched
jack spots the waitress coming out of the kitchen and motions for more coffee
she nods and smiles indicating shell be right over
jack returns the smile and holds up a hand to signal hell wait
jack turns back to see miles watching him
in a series of shots the saab now with its top down makes its way onto the and travels past landmarks that those familiar with the santa barbara area might
music accompanies this sequence that anchors us into the rhythm of a road trip
the car now descends the santa ynez mountains and heads toward buellton
miles and jack must shout to be heard in the open car
you know what
lets take the santa rosa turnoff and hit sanford first
whatevers closest man
i need a glass
these guys make top notch pinot and chardonnay
one of the best producers in santa barbara county
looking out the window look how beautiful this view is
what a day
i thought you hated chardonnay
i like all varietals
i just dont generally like the way they manipulate chardonnay in california too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation
the saab passes over the and turns onto santa rosa road
the boys now pass vineyards of immaculate grapevines
jesus what a day
isnt it gorgeous
and the oceans just right over that ridge
see the reason this regions great for pinot is that the cold air off the pacific flows in at night through these transverse valleys and cools down the berries
pinots a very thin skinned grape and doesnt like heat or humidity
jack looks at miles admiring his friends vast learning and articulateness
the saab now pulls of the road and makes its way down a long gravel driveway
i really hope your novel sells
so do i
noticing here we are
miles brings the car to a stop in the parking lot
as they get out and walk so whatd you guys finally decide on for the menu
i told you
filet and salmon
yeah but how are they making the salmon
poached with a yogurt dill sauce
i dont know
dont you always have white wine with fish
look at some point we have to find out because its going to make a big difference
taking out his phone let me call christine
doesnt have to be now
lets go taste
i owe her a call anyway
miles must curb his eagerness to go inside the tasting room as jack speed dials
so were up here about to taste some whites and we need to know how the caterers are going to make the salmon
jack listens then grows suddenly impatient
no i know i didnt forget but we wound up at miless moms house and it got really late and it was hard to call so im calling you now
i said i was sorry
yes i did
to miles you heard me say i was sorry right
miles just shrugs
miles heard me say i was sorry
as jack gets more and more involved with the phone call he wanders off across the parking lot progressively out of earshot
give me a break will you
i just called to find out about the salmon for our wedding to be more involved like you said and all you want to do is get into it about
last night and okay im sorry
im sorry i didnt call
youre totally right
i know but im trying to make this the best wedding i can with the best wine we can find
dont i get any credit for that
look ive got to go
im out here in the parking lot and miles is waiting for me
and so it goes jacks voice rising and falling
miles decides to head inside
miles is at the bar two glasses in front of him
jack walks in and bellies up next to him
proudly baked with a butter lime glaze
now were talking
chris burroughs a pourer in a cowboy hat and ponytail comes over
this is the condemned man
here he is
chris and jack shake hands
how you doing
you guys want to start with the vin gris
two glasses are filled with small amounts of pinot noir vin this is rose right
good yeah it is a rose
only this one is rather atypically made from pinot noir
joking to chris you know not all pinots are noir
miles swirls his glass in tight circles on the bar then lifts it to smell
jack clumsily imitates miles perhaps even spilling some wine in the process
let me show you
we see details of what miles now describes
first take your glass and examine the wine against the light
youre looking at color and clarity
what color is it supposed to be
depends on the varietal
just get a sense of it
now tip it
what youre doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim
tells you how old it is among other things usually more important with reds
this is a very young wine so its going to retain its color pretty solidly
now stick your nose in it
jack waves the glass under his nose as if it were a perfume bottle
dont be shy
get your nose in there
jack now buries his nose in the glass
what do you smell
i dont know
theres not much there yet but you can still find
more sniffs a little citrus
maybe some strawberry
and theres even a hint of like asparagus
or like a nutty edam cheese
jack smells again and begins to brighten
maybe a little strawberry
im not so sure about the cheese
now set your glass down and get some air into it
miles expertly swirls the wine
jack follows suit
oxygenating it opens it up unlocks the aroma and the flavors
now we smell again
they do so
thats what you do with every one
when do we get to drink it
jack gulps his wine down in one shot
miles chews his before swallowing
how would you rate this one
usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities but this ones pretty damn good
to chris this is the new one right chris
released it about two months ago
we like it
to miles you know you could work in a wine store
yeah that would be a good move
now miles notices something about jack
are you chewing gum
the saab passes through this danish themed tourist town
the saab makes its way into this very average looking central coast town right off the freeway
the saab pulls into the parking lot of this motel
and look theres the windmill itself its decorative blades motionless
miles and jack enter the room and throw their suitcases onto their respective beds
the sounds of a shower and off key singing come from the bathroom while miles sits impatiently on the bed
he pounds on the wall
hey jack hurry up
just a minute
opening the bedside drawer miles finds a gideons bible and tosses it in the trash apparently his hotel routine
freshly showered and dressed for dinner miles and jack amble along the shoulder of this busy local two lane highway
they pass a mall and a car dealership
i thought you said it was close
now im all pitted out
its not even a mile
we should have driven
not with the wine list these people have
we dont want to hold back
you think im making a mistake marrying christine
come on do you think im doing the right thing
tell the truth
youve been through it
well you waited for good reason and you proposed to christine for some good reason
so i think its great
youve got to have your eyes open thats all
i mean look at me
i thought victoria and i were set for life
christines dad hes been talking about bringing me into his property business
showing me the ropes
and thats something considering how long it took him to get over im not armenian
so im thinking about it
but i dont know might get a little incestuous
but mike does pretty well
a lot of high end commercial stuff
so youre going to stop acting
this would just provide some stability is what im saying
i can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there you know keep myself in the game in case something big comes along
were not getting any younger right
and my career well its gotten pretty you know frustrating
even with my new manager
maybe its time to settle down
if thats what feels right
convincing himself it does
then its a good thing
nodding feeling better yeah
miles leads them away from the road and across a parking lot
the camera pans to reveal the hitching post a local institution
miles and jack belly up
gary the samoan bartender spots miles and extends a welcoming hand
long time no see
whens that novel of yours coming out
we all want to read it
say this is my buddy jack
hes getting married next week
shaking jacks hand my condolences
what are you pouring tonight
lot of good stuff
looking at a row of bottles got the new bien nacido
want a taste
to jack they have their own label thats just outstanding
gary pours jack and miles a generous sample and the two men swirl sniff and taste
jack is beginning to get the hang of things
what do you think
tight as a nuns asshole but qood concentration
to gary pour us a couple
gary fills their glasses and corks the bottle
jack raises his glass to toast
heres to my last week of freedom
its going to be great
heres to us
they clink their glasses and take a drink
we linger on them as miles retreats inward and a restless jack scans the room
jack and miles review their menus
jack looks up and spots a pretty waitress placing an order at the bar
check it out
miles glances at the waitress and returns to his menu
you know her
sure i know maya
you know that chick
jack this is where i eat when i come up here
its practically my office
and sometimes i have a drink with the employees
shes worked here about a year maybe a year and a half
she is very hot
and very nice
and very married
check out the rock
jack leans forward and squints
doesnt mean shit
when christine was a hostess at sushi roku she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her
think it worked
how do you think i met her
this gals married to i think a philosophy professor at uc santa barbara
so whats a professors wife doing waitressing
obviously thats over
you dont know anything about this woman
lets just eat okay
focusing on the menu the duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the highliner pinot
just then maya comes by carrying a tray of food on her way to another table
good to see you
maya how are you
im doing good good
you look great
did you lose some weight
oh no actually
oh yeah sunday night
you guys been out tasting today
you know it
this is my friend jack
big smile hiya
smiling back hi
well nice to see you guys here
jesus shes jammin
and she likes you
what else do you know about her
well she does know a lot about wine
now were getting somewhere
and she likes pinot
jack shes a fucking waitress in buellton
how would that ever work
why do you always focus on the negative
didnt you see how friendly she was to you
she works for tips
youre blind dude
miles focuses again on the menu
i also recommend the ostrich
are refilled with the contents of yet another bottle of hitching post pinot noir
jack and miles are enjoying a post prandial drink
looks like hes thinking about something
then i hate tony levin
jack swirls his wine and downs it in one gulp
just then walks into the bar and takes a seat a few stools down
she has changed into a black cashmere sweater and corduroys lovely but tired
to gary highliner please
thats on us
maya looks over and smiles as gary pours her a glass from their bottle
maya gets an american spirit yellow out of her purse and lights it while gary pours her a glass
you want to join us
in no hurry she takes a long sip of her wine gets up and comes down the bar
so hows that book of yours going miles
i think you were almost done with it last time we talked
i finished it
good for you
its getting published
thats what were up here celebrating
miles shoots jack a look
jack responds with a dont fuck it up brother glower
she offers her glass and all clink
to jack are you a writer too
no im an actor
what kind of stuff
a lot of tv
i was a regular on a couple of series
and lately ive been doing a lot of commercials
anything id know
jack takes a deep breath and out comes a perfect voice over now with low low
mayas mouth drops open and curves into a big smile
you sound just like one of those guys
i am one of those guys
you are not
jack launches into another one of his sure fire hits
very fast consult your doctor before using this product
side effects may include oily discharge dizziness hives loss of appetite difficulty breathing and low blood pressure
if you have diabetes or a history of kidney trouble
this makes maya laugh a big throaty laugh
jack joins in
nervous about jacks aggressive flirtatiousness miles musters a tight courtesy smile
winding down oh
i needed that
they all take a drink of wine
so what are you guys up to tonight
before jack has a chance to speak were pretty wiped
probably go back to the hotel and crash
this makes maya slightly embarrassed at her apparent availability but she recovers quickly remains breezy
yeah i know what you mean
its a long drive up here
wherere you staying
maya downs the rest of her wine stamps out her smoke and picks up her jean jacket and purse
well good to see you miles
as she leaves well catch up with you later okay
but shes gone
jack gives miles a slow burn look
well probably go back to the hotel and crash
the guys walk drunkenly along the shoulder as cars whiz by
the girl is looking to party and you tell her were going to go back to our motel room and crash
well im tired
arent you tired
the chick digs you
she lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published
now ive got another lie to live down
im trying to get you some action but youve got to help me out just a little bit
didnt seem to me like thats what was going on
you were all over her
somebody had to do the talking
and by the way i was right
shes not married
how do you know
when she came to the bar sans rock
the screen is absolutely black
getting off work
looking for love
a little slap and tickle
she probably went home lit some candles put on some relaxing music took a nice hot bath and laid down on her bed with her favorite vibrator
jack begins to make a soft buzzing noise growing gradually louder and more rhythmic
have you no shame
theres now a rustling noise and footsteps
then a light is flipped on in the bathroom
miles closes the door behind him and the only light visible is at the bottom of the bathroom door
miles pees a series of semi forced short squirts
then a flush as a door opens and the light goes off
jack starts buzzing again
shut the fuck up
jack stops and miles climbs into bed
then you need to get your prostate checked
miles and jack are glancing at the menus
for some reason jack is humorless and grumpy
so whatre we going to have
pigs in a blanket
the ranchers special breakfast
or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard
not amused so whats the plan today
we head north begin the grape tour up there make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel
jack sarcastically taps an index finger to his temple
whats your problem
jack exhales and looks away as though he doesnt want to get into it
what is it
jack sucks his teeth a moment searching for the right words
then the dam bursts
i am going to get my nut on this trip miles
and you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg head downer shit
ooooh now the cards are on the table
yes they are
and im serious
do not fuck with me
i am going to get laid before i settle down on saturday
do you read me
sure big guy
whatever you say
its your party
im sorry im in the way and dragging you down
maybe youd have a better time on your own
you take the car
ill catch the train back
no see i want both of us to get crazy
we should both be cutting loose
i mean this is our last chance
this is our week
it should be something we share
the older waitress comes over
can i take your order
but i am warning you
oatmeal one poached egg and rye toast
glaring at miles pigs in a blanket
with extra syrup
the saab winds along this beautiful road that meanders through large open vineyards
a map and a moving line show the boys route
grapes growing on the vine
framed by foreground grapevines the saab passes in the distance
miles has just downed a taste of red wine
how much skin and stem contact
about four weeks
that explains all the tannins
and how long in oak
about a year
french or american
thats a good wood
just as the pourer turns away toward other tasters jack grabs the bottle and helps himself and miles to another glass
they slam back their drinks like tequila
miles brings the saab to a stop and the guys get out
before them lies an incredible view of endless vineyards
victoria and i used to like this view
lost in nostalgia once we had a picnic here and drank a opus one
with smoked salmon and artichokes but we didnt care
she has the best palate of any woman ive ever known
she could even differentiate italian wines
miles i gotta tell you something
victorias coming to the wedding
you told me
im okay with it
yeah but thats not the whole story
she got remarried
long pause when
about a month ago
to that guy
that guy with the restaurant
miles looks down at his shoes and draws a long breath
then he stiffly gets back in the open car and closes the door
miles continues to stare straight ahead
exploding jesus christ miles
i want to go home now
youve been divorced for two years already
people move on
its like you enjoy self pity
makes you feel special or something
is she bringing him to the wedding
what do you think
you drop this bombshell on me
why didnt you tell me before
because i knew youd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldnt even come on this trip
but then i figured here would be the best place to tell you
were here to forget about all that shit
were here to party
undeterred im going to be a fucking pariah
everyones just going to be holding their breath to see if im going to get drunk and make a scene
plus tony fucking levin
no no no
i talked to victoria
horrified youve all been talking about it
behind my back
talking about it
miles turns and locates an open bottle of wine in the back seat
he uncorks it and begins to swig
hey hey hey
no you dont
jack tries unsuccessfully to grab the bottle from miles but miles bolts out of the car
pursued by jack miles dashes down the hill all the while taking huge swigs from the bottle
miles slows to walk between rows of grapevines
he polishes off the bottle and tosses it
a painting jack catches up with him in the adjacent grapevine corridor
miless face crumbles as though he were about to cry
then he collapses to the ground and closes his eyes tight
jack looks around impatiently for a moment
then he squats down so he can see miles underneath the vines
miles ignores jack and focuses on the beautiful ripe grapes that surround him
they seem to distract him from his pain
you going to be okay
miles looks up and shakes his head a definitive no
jack cant help but laugh
the sun hangs low as the saab pulls into the parking lot jack at the wheel
the pourer a brunette in her early thirties breaks away from a boring couple down the bar
this is stephanie
hows it going
my friend and i are up here doing the wine tour and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a syrah
thats what people say
slurring slightly you gotta excuse him
yesterday he didnt know pinot noir from film noir
im a quick learner
she apparently likes big good natured lunks like jack
im trying to teach my friend here some basics about wine over the next few days before he goes off and whoomp
under the bar jack stomps on miless foot
stephanie slides two glasses in front of them
thats right im here to learn
i never had that much interest in wine before but this trip has been very enlightening
always like wine of course but i dont know
more of a beer man really
she thumps the cork off a bottle of chardonnay
well no better way to learn than tasting
she pours almost flirtatious amounts
now theres a girl who knows how to pour
whats your name
jack swirls the wine as though he were by now a sommelier
they look they smell they taste
so what do you think
quaffable but far from transcendent
i like it
stephanie reaches for another bottle and pours
jacks eyes never leave her
as they taste this is only the fifth year weve made this varietal
very few wineries around here do a straight cabernet franc
its from our vineyard up in santa maria
and it was a silver medal winner at paso robles last year
well ive come to never expect greatness from a cab franc and this ones no exception
sort of a flabby overripe ignoring him tastes good to me
you live around here stephanie
in santa ynez
low to miles and i agree with you about cab franc
were just over in buellton
you know a gal named maya
works at the hitching post
sure i know maya
we just had a drink with her last night
miles knows her
could we move on to the syrah please
as she turns to reach for the right bottle jack winks at miles
miles shakes his head
this is our estate syrah
she pours each of them a full half glass
youre a bad bad girl stephanie
i might need to be spanked
she notices the boring couple visibly annoyed that she has been monopolized
as she wanders down the bar jack turns to miles his mouth wide open
a bad girl miles
she might need to be spanked
do you know how often these pourers get hit on
they glance down the bar at stepanie
she smiles back
miles is killing time by the car staring at his shoes
he looks over and sees jack waddling over from the tasting room with two cases of wine
get the trunk
you have the keys
jack puts the cases down and glances back at the building
she called maya whos not working tonight so were all going out
been divorced for a year now bud
jack puts the wine in the trunk and they get in the car
stephanie holy shit
chick had it all going on
well she is cute
shes a fucking hottie
and you almost tell her im getting married
whats the matter with you
drumming on the steering wheel gotta love it
gotta love it
golf on espn
sit transfixed each on his own bed
the curtains are drawn
then out of nowhere mocking you know how often these pourers get hit on
getting up im going for a swim
get the blood flowing
want to come
i want to watch this
a guy gets ready to putt
the announcer whispers what an important moment this is
the guy misses
the sound of an aerosol can
time to get up
jack spraying his feet with some dr
miles pulls himself out of bed and slouches toward his suitcase
fucking chick in the jacuzzi goddamn miles fucking going nuts up here
whole place is wide open
jack does some actors weird warm up stretch
so what should i wear
i dont know
casual but nice
they think youre a writer
as miles begins to dig through his suitcase jack flips open his cellphone and speed dials
dont you have any other shoes
miles glances as his shoes sitting sadly on the floor
into the phone hello
oh hey baby just checking in
were about to go out for dinner probably be out pretty late so i thought id say goodnight now
i know i love you too
i miss you
the boys get out of the car and walk along a timbered sidewalk in this tourist town with wine tasting rooms and gourmet restaurants
please just try to be your normal humorous self okay
like who you were before the tailspin
do you remember that guy
people love that guy
and dont forget your novel is coming out in the fall
whats it called
do not sabotage me
if you want to be a lightweight thats your call
but do not sabotage me
aye aye captain
and if they want to drink merlot were drinking merlot
dead serious if anyone orders merlot im leaving
i am not drinking any fucking merlot
relax miles jesus
did you bring your xanax
miles takes a small bottle from his pocket and rattles it
and dont drink too much
i dont want you going to the dark side or passing out
do you hear me
no going to the dark side
miles quickly pops a xanax
jack gives him a final look in the eye
were going in
the boys enter this cozy if crowded restaurant and exchange words with the hostess
then they notice at a booth waving at them
they look great
make their way to the table jack wearing a broad confident jack plops down next to stephanie while miles politely eases in on mayas side
jack touches a hand to stephanies bare neck and massages it meaningfully
how you doin tonight beautiful
you look great
including maya you both do
not so bad yourself
meanwhile miles looks over at maya and purses his lips in an affable if uncomfortable smile
then what are you drinking
a fiddlehead sauvignon blanc
how is it
sliding the glass try it
as miles swirls the wine and takes a sip he begins to relax
twelve months in oak
on a sauvignon blanc
i know the winemaker
she comes in the restaurant all the time
this is good
little hints of clove
i love that
a waiter finishes listing off the specials
medallions of pork with a dusting of black truffles served with a root vegetable foulon and wasabi whipped potatoes
and finally a copper river salmon grilled on an alder wood plank
and that comes with roasted new potatoes and steamed watercress
the four diners exchange looks of delight
and who gets the wine list
miles raises his hand and takes the leather bound book
teasing i guess miles wants it
jack glares at miles who immediately gets the hint
you ladies choose
jack smiles and nods his approval
jack takes the book out of miless hands and offers it to the girls
you choose stephanie
opening it so what does everyone feel like
whatever you girls want
its on us tonight
skys the limit
no were paying for the wine
i dont think so
were celebrating miless book deal
well in that case
miles draws a long breath
whats everyone ordering
then we can sort out the wine
jack shoots miles a look
im having the salmon
thats what im having
still scanning the wines im thinking about the duck breast
slapping his menu shut me too
well that narrows things down
stephanie lowers the menu so that only her eyes peer over the top
she looks at the others and they look back at her
pinot noir to me
jack looks at miles and raises one hand for a high five
miles reluctantly slaps jacks hand
this causes the girls to laugh
music starts theyre off
dinner is improvised but includes the arrival of the first wine
maya takes a turn with the wine list
miles pushes her finger down into the prices with three digits
new stemware is provided with the arrival of the second the four of them drink
stephanie and jack get cozier and cozier
the salmon and duck arrive
miles is too shy to look into mayas eyes
shes interested and available its too much for him
as miles gets drunker the camera angles become sloppier the cutting choppier
miles pontificates about some aspect of wine that maya and stephanie find interesting
left out in the cold his jaw tight jack wants to find a way in but cant
miles reaches over to refill his glass but jacks arm shoots out to stop him slow down
close on miles as a distant rumble begins to sound the rumble of an oncoming anxiety attack
by now he has drunk so much that he spaces out descending into miles is boarding an open boat atop this underground river the river styx
just beyond a ghoulish human cargo the hooded boatman charon wields a long staff
miles is crossing over to the dark side
miles returns to earth to find jack and stephanie now in their own little world jack explaining something to stephanie that she finds fascinating just fascinating
miles converses with maya but its clear from her bemused expression that hes being charming if not entirely coherent
another wine reaches the table a comte armand pornrnard
miles looks over at jack and stephanie
they share a short but sensual kiss
miles is on his feet threading his way through the tables
he is very unsteady and we cut between first and third person perspectives
he tries the mens room door but its locked
he pulls the xanax out his pocket and pops one in his mouth swallowing it dry
he notices a payphone nearby
thinking better of it for a moment miles makes a drunken bee line for the receiver
as many numbers are dialed and we hear the tones completely out of sync along with a sound melange of interior phone ringing and a pickup
as miles presses it desperately to his head
miles feigns an implausible upbeat tone
how the hell are you
whats uh whats on your mind
heard you got remarried
didnt think you had the stomach for another go round
just some local pinot you know then a little burgundy
that old cotes de beaune
miles laughs at his own non existent joke
where are you
a little place in los olivos
excellent food too you should try it
thought of you at the hitching post last night
miles dont call me when youre drunk
i just wanted you to know ive decided not to go to the wedding so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable you know run in or something well worry
you wont see me there
my wedding gift to you and whats his name
what is his name
silence then ken
miles i dont care if you come to the wedding or not
well im not coming barbie
so you guys have fun
im going to hang up now miles
rushing to keep her on you see vicki i just heard about this today you getting married that is and i was kind of taken aback
kind of hard to believe
i guess i just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and i just i just miles maybe it is better if you dont come
to the wedding
miles sucks something from between his two front teeth
whatever you say vicki
youre the boss
he hangs up as nonchalantly as if it had been a sales call and heads back to the table
for a flash miles is walking an unstable narrow rope bridge extending vertiginously across a great chasm
miles reaches the table tries to sit and slips onto the although at first jack blinks heavily in disgust the girls burst into hysterical laughter
jack then laughs too perhaps easy boy
maya helps him back into the booth
are you all right
picking up his glass this is my blood
stephanie makes a head gesture to maya who nods in return
to the guys excuse us
sorry to make you get up again miles
miles and jack allow the girls to pass
then what the fuck man
what is up
miles reaches for his wine glass but jack moves it away
pull yourself together man
but in throwing open his arms for emphasis he spills a water glass
jack rights it and throws a napkin on the tablecloth
where were you
did you drink and dial
miless silence confirms his guilt and shame
why do you always do this
victorias gone man
miles looks down and squeezes his eyes tight while pushing out an exhale through his nose
you are blowing a great opportunity here miles
fucking maya man
she knows wine
what is this morose come down bullshit
these girls want to party
and what was that fucking ten minute lecture on what was it vouvrays
i mean come on
lets just say im uncomfortable with the whole scenario
oh jesus miles
miles belligerently reaches for his comte armand
jack lets it pass
and dont forget all the bad times you had with victoria
how small she make you feel
thats why you had the affair in the first place
shut your face
dont you see how mayas looking at you
you got her on the hook
reel her in
come on lets rachet this up a notch
you know how to to do it
passing a glass drink some agua
miles looks at the water takes it and drains it
the girls now return to the table
the guys slide over
trying to appear sober should we get dessert
we were thinking
why dont we go back to my place
ive got wine some insane cheeses music whatever
jack raises both arms like a football referee
trees and bushes lit by the headlights show us were headed into the woods
miles blinks heavily as he tries to make a sense of a hand drawn map
grabbing the map let me see that
the saab pulls into a gravel driveway and comes to a stop outside this wood framed cottage
jack and miles get out and head for the front door
on the way jack reaches into his coat pocket and produces a string of four condoms
one for you three for me
miles wordlessly takes his
just before they climb the porch steps you sure you want to do this
jack stops and looks at him for a moment with almost hostile incredulity
the front door is open
jack knocks twice on the screen door before going in
the boys enter this modest living room furnished with weathered but charming old furniture
scattered here and there are childrens toys
finger paintings are taped to the walls
candles are lit and music is playing
stephanie sails in
what happened to you guys
couple of wrong turns
pointing a thumb at miles thanks to magellan here
after a brief hug stephanie and jack peck kiss
to miles mayas in the kitchen
miles hesitates a moment before jack elbows him toward miles wanders in to find maya squatting in front of a little temperature controlled wine storage unit
she got anything good
stephs way into pinots and syrahs
calling out hey steph
you sure we can open anything
anything we want
anything but the jayer richebourg
she has a richebourg
i have completely underestimated stephanie
who do you think youre dealing with here
maya slips out a bottle of eschevaux
how about this
miles nods vigorously
maya looks back and forth between miles and the wine her eyes narrowed
then she slides it back in
i dont think we know each other well enough
picking out another bottle id say this guys more our speed
they rise and miles glances at the andrew murray syrah and raising his eyebrows agrees
maya begins opening it
so what gems do you have in your collection
not much of a collection really
i havent had the wallet for that so i sort of live bottle to bottle
but ive got a couple things im saving
i guess the star would be a cheval blanc
youve got a cheval blanc thats just sitting there
go get it
pushing him playfully stern right now
miles laughs fights back a bit
seriously the s are peaking arent they
at least thats what ive read
yeah i know
it might be too late already
what are you waiting for
i dont know
with the right person
it was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary
understanding maya considers her response
the day you open a cheval blanc thats the special occasion
how long have you been into wine
i started to get serious about seven years ago
what was the bottle that did it
eighty eight sassicaia
miles whistles and raises his eyebrows
maya pours and they clink their glasses together before savoring the wine
we gotta give it a moment but this is tasty
how about you
tastes again i think they overdid it a bit
too much alcohol
overwhelms the fruit
tasting again impressed yeah id say youre right on the money
then miles absently scans the refrigerator door and spots a photo of stephanie holding a little girl
is this stephanies kid
sure is cute
yeah sienas a sweetie
is she sleeping or
shes with her grandmother
shes with stephs mom
she spends a lot of time over there
well shes stephanie
jacks voice over voice from the other room
and now for a low low
is followed by peals of laughter
you got kids
nah id just fuck them up
that was the one unpolluted part of my divorce no kids
yeah same here
maya nods as she sips again looking distant for a moment thinking about something else
lets go in there
maya takes the bottle and they wander into jack and stephanie are gone
from a distant bedroom comes more laughter
looks like our friends are hitting it off
while maya goes to turn down the stereo miles sits on the couch
mayas shirt rides up as she crouches giving miles a glimpse of the small of her back
she takes a seat opposite miles on the couch
they look at each other without speaking
just what is the vibe here
its kind of weird sitting here with you in stephanies house
all those times you came into the restaurant
its like youre a real person now
yeah i know
its kind of weird
out of context
an awkward silence broken by maya
so whats your novel about
well its a little difficult to summarize
it begins as a first person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke
kind of based on personal experience but only loosely
whats the title
the day after yesterday
yeah but its more
so is it kind of about death and mortality or
but not really
it shifts around a lot
like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father
and some other stuff happens some parallel narrative and then it evolves or devolves into a kind of a robbe grillet mystery you know with no real resolution
anyway i think its amazing youre getting it published
i know how hard it is
just to write it even
squeezing it out yeah
like me i have this stupid paper due on friday and as usual im freaked out about it
just like in high school
it never changes
im working on a masters in horticulture
chipping away at it
i didnt know there was a college here
i commute to san luis obispo twice a week
you want to work for a winery or something someday
i do have a copy of the manuscript in the car
its not fully proofed but if youre okay with a few typos
im the queen of typos
sipping the wine wow this is really starting to open up
what do you think
my palates kind of shot but from what i can tell id dub it pretty damn good
can i ask you a personal question
bracing himself sure
why are you so into pinot
its like a thing with you
miles laughs at first then smiles wistfully at the question
he searches for the answer in his glass and begins slowly
i dont know
its a hard grape to grow
as you know
its thin skinned temperamental ripens early
its not a survivor like cabernet that can grow anywhere and thrive even when neglected
pinot needs constant care and attention and in fact can only grow in specific little tucked away corners of the world
and only the most patient and nurturing growers can do it really can tap into pinots most fragile delicate qualities
only when someone has taken the time to truly understand its potential can pinot be coaxed into its fullest expression
and when that happens its flavors are the most haunting and brilliant and subtle and thrilling and ancient on the planet
maya has found this answer revealing and moving
i mean cabernets can be powerful and exalting but they seem prosaic to me for some reason
how about you
what about me
i dont know
why are you into wine
i suppose i got really into wine originally through my ex husband
he had a big kind of show off cellar
but then i found out that i have a really sharp palate and the more i drank the more i liked what it made me think about
like what a fraud he was
no but i do like to think about the life of wine how its a living thing
i like to think about what was going on the year the grapes were growing how the sun was shining that summer or if it rained
what the weather was like
i think about all those people who tended and picked the grapes and if its an old wine how many of them must be dead by now
i love how wine continues to evolve how every time i open a bottle its going to taste different than if i had opened it on any other day
because a bottle of wine is actually alive its constantly evolving and gaining complexity
that is until it peaks like your and begins its steady inevitable decline
and it tastes so fucking good
now it is miless turn to be swept away
mayas face tells us the moment is right but miles remains frozen
he needs another sign and maya is bold enough to offer it reaches out and places one hand atop his
pointing bathroom over there
miles gets up and walks out
maya sighs and gets and american spirit out of her purse
the bathrooms a mess the shower curtain is filthy and the chipped and water stained tub is filled with childrens miles is bent over the sink splashing water on his
face trying to sober up and gather his courage
he stands and without drying his face presses his palms against his cheeks
then he takes a deep breath and drops his hands
you are such a loser
miles comes out of the bathroom and looks for maya but shes not there
then he hears a noise from the kitchen so he goes through the door into maya is at the sink filling a glass with water
i was just getting some water
you want some water
miles goes to stand by her and accepts a glass of water
just as shes about to fill a second glass he stops her and looks her in the eye trying to recapture a moment that is long gone
he kisses her and she kisses back but the whole thing feels strained and awkward
after a few seconds maya breaks away
but instead of resuming the kiss she steps past him heading back into the living room
i should probably get going
miles realizes hes blown it and silently berates himself
miles drives down the hill behind mayas car which leads him through this very rural road
mayas car comes to a stop just ahead of the saab
she puts it in park and gets out
miles rolls down his window as maya leans over
you know how to get back to the windmill right
i had a good time tonight miles
i really did
so did i
see you around
did you still want to read my novel
miles turns to the backseat locates a large manuscript box and hands it to maya
he turns around again produces a second box and hands it over as well
hope you like it
feel free to stop reading at any time
ill take no offense
she gives him a friendly peck on the cheek
after she gets back in her car she heads in one direction while miles heads in the opposite
jacks cellphone rings
still fully clothed miles staggers across the room
fishing the phone out of jacks windbreaker pocket he looks at the caller id erganian christine and the number
he briefly considers his options answer it
shut it off
before placing it atop jacks suitcase
the moment he lies back down on the bed the motel phone rings
an old digital clock next to it reads l
as miles closes his eyes and pulls the pillow over his aching head we again vroom
outside a roaring motorcycle comes to a stop
then over the sound of an idling engine come familiar if indistinct voices and laughter
miles opens his bleary eyes and listens
footsteps pound on the balcony outside and jack lets himself in flushed and exuberant
fucking chick is unbelievable
un be lieve able
he pounds on the wall then goes into the bathroom and without closing the door unzips his pants to pee
goddamn miles she is nasty
nasty nasty nasty
well im glad you got it out of your system
a hungover miles gets up and looks out the door jack has left open
down in the parking lot he sees atop a mid sized motorcycle wearing a weathered fringed suede jacket
she gives him a big friendly wave
returns the wave and goes back inside
you didnt invite stephanie to come with us did you
with a flush jack emerges from the bathroom and opens his bag
oh hey change of plans
stephs off today so she and i are going on a hike
we were supposed to play golf
in fact use my clubs
theyre brand new gift from christines dad
slapping some cash on the dresser its on me
oh say by the way stephanie and me were thinking wed all go to the hitching post tonight and sit at one of mayas tables and shell bring us some
great wines and then we can all sitting down count me out
oooh i see
didnt go so good last night huh
thats a shocker
you mean getting drunk and calling victoria didnt put you in the mood
you dumb fuck
your divorce pains getting real old real fast dude
miles looks down
jack heads for the door
yeah well maybe you should check your messages first
jack stops eyeing miles suspiciously
miles tosses jack his phone
jack flips it open and scrolls down with his thumb
he doesnt like what he sees
pointing at the room phone shes been leaving messages here too
he snaps the phone shut and puts it back
you should call her
heading out the door see ya
jack picks up his phone sits on the bed and looks defiantly at miles
ive got no problem calling her
now jack closes his eyes and brings the heel of his hand to his forehead as he begins to concoct the big lie
opening his phone wait outside will you
miles wanders out and looks down at stephanie
that was fun last night
youve got quite a wine collection
hey i talked to maya this morning
she said she had a good time too
you should call her
miles says nothing
he had to make a phone call
stephanie cuts her bikes engine and climbs off propping it up on the kickstand
so what are you up to today miles
just kickin back i guess
i dont know
jack and i were supposed to go golfing
yeah i reserved the tee time about a month ago
no i think its kind of a stupid game
i mean at least i could never get into it
i tried it once
jack loves golf
crazy about it
just then jack cracks open the motel room door
hushed hey miles
miles ducks back inside
do you have that other condom
miles reaches into his wallet and hands over the little foil square
whatd christine say
lucked out got voice mail
jack bounds out of the room and down the stairs like a child on christmas morning
miles watches jack climb on the bike behind stephanie grasping her waist
stephanie and jack peel out leaving miles alone on the balcony
as we begin to hear a snipping sound which carries us to miles sits outside carefully trimming his toenails
snip snip snip
music begins for this mournful montage of solitude
miles takes a styrofoam cup and helps himself to a cup of complimentary coffee from a pump thermos
then he takes a look at the rack of pamphlets of local tourist attractions a water park a mystery cave and of course winery after winery
amid turbulent water miles corrects his students papers
he is alone in the tub but at the nearby pool stocky kids play noisily with super soakers
the paper hes reading is marked up with circled spelling errors and one entire paragraph has been crossed out
finding a new error miles writes no
camera pans to reveal a stack of papers already heavily marked with corrections some of them mottled with water stains
miles flosses his lips pulled back into a grotesque moue
then he brushes with a sonic care toothbrush
miles checks his machine
no new messages
he hangs up disgusted
a small buellton eatery
the only customer right now miles eats awkwardly with his chopsticks
miles drives ball after ball unsuccessfully trying to release his frustration
the saab roars past us perhaps going a little too fast
whistling absently as he drives miles leans over to turn the radio on and fiddle around to find a good station
then all of a sudden whump
the car has struck something with a hideous sound followed immediately by the receding arf arf arf arf of an injured dog in the saabs wake
miles applies the brakes
miles gets out of his car just in time to see scampering into the nearby woods
miles looks around has anyone seen him
is there a nearby residence
finding nothing miles momentarily weighs his options before finally giving he follows the path of the dog into still hearing occasional distant barking miles finds his way among the trees
and bushes looking in vain for the ill fated cur
after a frenetic search miles reluctantly gives up and heads back
miles has returned to where he hit the dog
just then miles notices two mexican children watching him from just down the road
they disappear into the bushes
looking like a criminal miles trots back to the saab climbs behind the wheel and speeds away
the saab pulls into the parking lot
miles trudges up the stops to the room
he opens the door and sees atop stephanie plowing her fertile fields
despite the interruption their pace does not alter
miles quickly shuts the door
miles pours himself another glass of pinot
jack comes in and spots his morose friend
hey there you are
whatre you drinking
jack reaches over to check out the bottles label
miles remains cool to jacks amiability
to the bartender could i get a glass please
to miles stephanie took me out into the pinot fields today
it was awesome
i think i finally got a handle on the whole process from the soil to the vine to the what do you call it
selection and harvest
and the whole you know big containers where they mix it
we even ate pinot grapes right off the vine
the new expert still a little sour but already showing potential for great structure
stephanie really knows her shit miles
jack now has his glass and pours himself some wine
where is stephanie
getting cleaned up
what the fuck are you doing
with this chick
jack just looks at him
does she know about saturday
but ive been honest
i havent told her im available
and she knows this trip up here is only for a few days
jack stops short in a rare instance of self censorship
i dont know just
well ive been doing some thinking
oh youve been thinking
i may have to put the wedding on hold is all
miles looks at him with incredulity
i fully realize that making a change like that might be tricky for certain people to accept at first but life is short miles
ive got to be sure im doing the right thing before taking such a big step
and not just for my sake
im thinking about christines feelings too
i take marriage very seriously always have
thats why ive never done it before
the day i get married its going to be the real thing
miles just looks at his friend waiting for more
being with stephanie has opened my eyes
shes not uptight or controlling
shes just cool
things are so easy with her
fucks like an animal
im telling you i went deep last night miles
miles draws a long sigh
dont get all judgmental on me
this is my deal
its my life and its my call
they fall silent for a moment
then i was hoping to get some understanding from you
and im not getting it
understanding of what
like i might be in love with another woman
twenty four hours with some wine pourer chick and you think youre in love
and give up everything
look whos talking
youve been there
yes i have and do i look like a happy man
was all that drama with brenda a happy thing for me to do
is she a part of my life now
this is totally different
im talking about avoiding what youre talking about
thats the distinction
i have not made the commitment yet
i am not married
i have not said the words
in a few days i might get married and if i do then i wont be doing stuff like this anymore
otherwise whats the whole point of getting married
and what about stephanie
shes a woman with a kid
a single mom
what do you think shes looking for
interrupting heres what im thinking
we move up here you and me buy a vineyard
you design your own wine ill handle the business side
then you get inspired and write a new novel
as for me if an audition comes along hell las two hours away
youve gone crazy
what do you care anyway
you dont even like christine
of course i like christine
you said she was shallow
yeah and a nouveau riche
that was three years ago after that first party
look miles all i know is im an actor
all i have is my instinct
his hand on his chest my intuition thats all i have
and youre asking me to go against it
and thats just wrong
just then stephanie walks in
she cozies up to jack and he kisses the top of her head
we should probably get going
as a crazy car races through the obstacle ridden track often leaving the road much like jacks libido
to reveal six year old siena seated in jacks lap as they drive together
a delighted siena laughs and giggles
miles sits nearby with stephanie and her fifty something two pack a day mother caryl
stephanies heard this a thousand times but if id done what i wanted and id bought up in santa maria when i had the chance i would have made a
fortune when they put in that outlet center and that home depot
a drag off her cigarette then to stephanie your father knew it too but he was a fucking chickenshit
caryl looks over her shoulder her gaze drawn to jack and siena so completely happy together
caryl exhales a puff of smoke as she watches
stephanie is equally enthralled
miles takes it all in trying his best not to shake his head in disgust
caryl is behind the wheel of her oldsmobile as stephanie gets siena buckled up in the backseat
jack pulls miles aside
listen im going to make sure steph and siena get home safe and then maybe well hook up with you later okay
dispirited sure whatever
maybe ill catch a movie
stephanie kisses miless cheek before getting in the car next to her mom
see you miles
you take care
bye siena caryl
as he gets in the car call me on my cell if you go out
miles watches them drive away then heads toward his saab
as miles places a box of security envelopes a packet of beef jerky and some tropical fruit skittles
miles points over the cashiers shoulder
and could i get a barely leqal
as the cashier reaches for the magazine no um the new one
miles is once again flossing
miles opens a bottle of pinot and pours himself a glass
he carries it to bed takes a nice big slug lies down on the bed and opens his magazine
the barely legal face down on his chest miles awakens with a start and looks at the clock radio
he thinks a moment takes a deep breath and bounds off the bed
as little needles of water come at us
miles takes a nice hot shower
but wait he has forgotten to put the shower curtain inside the tub
a closer look reveals a growing puddle of water on the floor
miles walks across the parking lot
he pauses before entering then forces himself to take the leap
miles affects nonchalance as he searches briefly for maya
he continues on into the bar
hows it hanging miles
you know me
i love it up here
how about you
busy night for a tuesday
we had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour
usually theyre not too rowdy but tonight there was something going on
full moon or something
what can i get you
glass or bottle
considers then bottle
you got it
say is maya working
havent seen her
i think shes off tonight
say wheres your buddy
miles just smiles
gary serves miles alone at the bar
miles takes his first drink
oh thats tasty
its closing time
the front door flies open and miles staggers out sideways
gary follows him out concerned
you okay miles
miles heads in the wrong direction at first then realizes his mistake and steers himself back toward the windmill
the door bursts open and jack comes bounding in
come on dude
lets go golfing
i got us in at alisal
miles comes to very hungover
thats a public course
then no stephanie
i need a break anyway
shes getting a little clingy
magnanimous this is our day
jack tees off with a manly athletic swing and shades his eyes to watch the balls trajectory
miles disheveled and sullen approaches the teebox sticks a tee in the ground and sets his ball
did you ever got ahold of maya yesterday
she likes you man
stephaniell tell you
preparing to swing can you give me some room here
stepping back oh yeah
miles lifts his club
you know in life you gotta strike when the irons hot
miles refocuses and swings just as jack offers more helpful advice
dont whiff it
despite the distraction miles manages to make a good long drive
youre an asshole
jack is pouring two dixie cups of wine as miles prepares to take his next swing
what about your agent
hear anything yet
what do you thinks going on
could be anything
been checking your messages
they probably think my book is such a piece of shit that its not even worthy of a response
i guess ill just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life
but you dont know yet so your negativitys a bit premature wouldnt you say
miles says nothing
or fuck those new york publishers
publish it yourself
ill chip in
just get it out there get it reviewed get it in libraries
let the public decide
giving jack a look that says jack has no idea what hes talking about miles takes a stance over the ball and focuses
dont come over the top
just trying to be helpful
a moment later its all about stillness miles
miles drops his club and turns to jack
whats the matter with you man
why are you so hostile
i know youre frustrated with your life right now but you can choose not to be so hostile
holding out a cup of wine here
still fuming miles begrudgingly accepts the wine and has a taste
hes immediately distracted from his woes
what is it
i dont know
got it from stephanie
miles downs the rest and is intrigued by the taste
let me see the label
suddenly a golfball thuds against the hard fairway directly behind them
whirling around what the fuck
way back on the tee box some yards away are a foursome of two couples
one of the men is waving his driver
shouting barely audible hurry it up will you
jack looks at miles the two incredulous
fucker hit into us
yelling hey asshole
thats not cool
throw me his ball
jack walks over picks up the offending ball and tosses it to miles
miles gets out his wood and thwock
cuts it back low and hard
duck for cover as the ball whistles over their heads
climb in their cart and hasten down the fairway toward jack and miles
watches their approach grinning
oh this is going to be fun
jerking a driver from his bag this is going to be fun
jack heads in their direction brandishing the club like a medieval knight with a mace
as the husbands get a look at this sight they turn their cart around and speed back toward their wives
hit into us again motherfuckers and ill ass rape all four of you
jack and miles are turning in their cart and hoisting their clubs over their shoulders
just dont give up on maya
cool smart chicks like that they like persistence
i dont want to talk about it
all i know is shes beautiful
lots of soul
perfect for you
im not going to feel good about this trip until you guys hook up
dont you just want to feel that cozy little box grip down on your johnson
nearby a golfer is with his young son
hey you mind keeping it down buddy
miles and jack walk toward their car
is it the money thing
is what the money thing
well yeah thats part of it
woman finds out how i live that im not a published author that im a liar essentially then yeah any interest is gonna evaporate real quick
if you dont have money at my age youre not even in the game
youre just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir
is an abattoir like a
what is that
but you are going to get the good news this week about your book
i know you are
i can feel it
jacks cellphone rings and he checks the caller id
picking up hey baby
i mean i would but let me see
oh fuck it were going
well be right there
he snaps his phone shut and turns to miles
were going to have some fun
were going to have some of it
what exactly are we going to do
i said okay
you have to tell me miles finally smiles
the saab pulls up where stephanie and maya await with bottles of wine and a picnic basket
the girls climb into the back seat and the car speeds away
theyre going fast hair whipping around
hey miles i heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me
i mean yeah i stopped by for a drink
didnt see you
i had class
well nice to see you now
that cars going a little too fast
the two couples wander around this historic site
the girls have led them to a beautiful spot
we see the progress of their picnic
we dont hear them but there is a growing intimacy about their interaction
even maya and miles seem to be overcoming residual awkwardness from the other night
jack and stephanie lean on each other as they eat and sip wine
finally the two couples are silhouetted against the sunset
the parking lot is crowded
the foursome join others headed toward the main building
a lecture by british wine sage leslie brough is in progress
he holds aloft a riedel burgundy glass containing one of the few but growing number of local reds worthy of his attention
as our foursome listen attentively jack leans over to miles
you ever actually read any of this guys books
he wrote a great one on burgundy and i used to get his newsletter but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting
plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century and they turned out to be turkeys
fucker never retracted
stephanie leans forward and signals to maya with a yawn or a gagging finger in mouth that they hightail it
although miles protests at first they stand and leave
stephanie finds a door which she tests to see whether it is open
she leads her pals furtively inside this is an enormous dimly lit chamber filled with stainless steel fermentation tanks and stacks of oak barrels
as the two couples walk in the near darkness they are entranced
maya takes miless hand and leads him away
in the background stephanie and jack lean against a tank kissing
camera dollies to reveal miles and maya among the barrels in the foreground
they are shy with each other on the verge of kissing but holding back
three bottles of wine sit empty on the coffee table
the four friends sit on the floor around the coffee table
they drink wine and pass a joint
suddenly they explode in a sleepy siena appears at the hallway door rubbing her eyes
stephanie gets up but jack stops her gathers siena in his arms and takes her back to bed
the saab pulls away from the house
miles sits in his own passenger seat as maya tries her hand at the saab
maya leads miles up her back stairway
theyre both a little woozy from the hours of drinking
maya searches through her purse for her keys while miles hovers directly behind her staring at her ear
just as maya puts the key in the lock he impulsively leans forward to kiss the nape of her neck
mayas reaction is immediate she turns to embrace miles giving him a long kiss
then she opens the door pulls him inside and closes the door in our face
the camera pans to the nearby rooftops
the camera pans back to mayas door tilting down to find a blue wrapped new york times
the door opens and mayas hand picks up the newspaper
the camera follows maya inside to it is a small clean apartment furnished with simple taste
maya is dressed in a robe and holds a coffee mug
she drops the paper on the dining table and continues into where miles lies on his stomach dead to the world
his stubbly face is squished against the mattress and he snores lightly
maya looks at him for a moment before shaking his foot
this is a weekly event in a big parking lot organic produce candles and incense honey and cider
maya and miles are shopping
miles carries the bags
across from each other at a picnic table and surrounded by the remnants of breakfast miles and maya read the newspaper
miles is doing the crossword puzzle
you guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today
whats the latest we can get there
about two thirty
noticing did you hear about this bordeaux tasting dinner down in santa barbara saturday night
its a little pricey but if you wanted to go id be into it
why dont you stay through the weekend
miles has just figured out a difficult clue
as he writes it down no weve got to get back friday for the rehearsal dinner
what rehearsal dinner
miles stops writing
whos getting married
maya leads the way toward the saab
were you ever going to say anything
of course i was
i mean just now i could have made up some story but i didnt
i told you the truth
maya turns to confront miles with a look of give me a break
miles reaches out to touch her
jerking away dont touch me
just take me home
miles drives glancing occasionally at maya who stares straight ahead
ive told him
ive told him over and over but hes out of control
do you know what hes been saying to her
hes an actor so it cant be good
oh just that he loves her
that shes the only woman who has ever really rocked his world
how he adores siena
how he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to
im sure he believed every word
a stony silence
please believe me
i was even on the verge of telling you last night but
but you wanted to fuck me first
miles brings the car to a stop
maya opens the door and begins to get out
you know i just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception
and ive been doing just fine
and i havent been with anyone since my divorce
this has been a big deal for me maya hanging out with you and last night
i really like you maya
and im not jack
im just his
his freshman roommate from san diego state
maya wants to let miless words reach her but she cant just yet
could i have my paper please
unsure what she wants at first miles reaches into the back seat for the new york times
he hands it to her and watches until she goes inside
miles pulls up and parks
as miles enters a shirtless jack drops the barely legal and is immediately upon him grabbing him in a big bearhug
the tv is on perhaps showing an e
true hollywood story
heres my boy
heres my boy
whos your daddy boy
who is yo daddy
put me down jack
jack continues his paean to miless triumphant night
i said put me down
still gripping miles in a bearhug jack flings the both of them onto the bed
now on top of miles jack kisses both cheeks
im so proud of you
let me love you
now they get up off the bed
so tell me everything
i like details
youre kidding right
tell me what happened you fucker or ill tie your dick in a knot
lets leave it alone
jack looks at miles his face frozen with incomprehension
you didnt get any did you
off miless silence youre a homo
just stop okay
make something up and thats what happened
whatever you want
write my confession and ill sign it
just stop pushing me all the time
i cant take it
youre an infant
this is all a big party for you but not for me
this is serious
and you just
leave me alone okay
youre fucking me up
miles begins to calm down
jack grows concerned and sensitively puts one arm around his friend
did you have trouble performing
shut up jack
the phone rings and both men look at it silenced by the ominous sound
dont answer it
but jack is drawn to it as though enticed by a strange game of russian roulette
im telling you dont
jack picks up the receiver and puts it to his ear
oh hey honey
how you doing
miles lies on his bed and clamps both hands over his ears
his face is dark with resentment
let me call you back
miles and i are in the middle of something
no its nothing serious miles is just having one of his freak outs
love you too
ill call you right back
jack hangs up
this whole week has gone sour
it isnt turning out like it was supposed to
deadly serious i want to go home
whos being selfish now
im the one getting married
i thought this week was supposed to be about me
we gotta slow down
closing his eyes im so tired
lets just get out of here
i know what you need
jack watches miles be fitted for sneakers
a sales associate ties miless laces
there you go
miles gets up and walks in a circle
do you like them
yeah theyre great
theyre really sporty
are they too sporty
the boys exit sears miles wearing his new shoes and carrying a plastic bag with a string handle
noticing something oh here wait a second
i want to run in here real quick
he heads toward a toys store
over his shoulder i want to get something for siena
mildly concerned miles watches jack go into the store
miles is slumped in the passenger seat as jack drives
they pass a big commercial winery
jack slows down preparing to turn in
how about this one
we didnt hit this one
yeah its frass canyon
its a joke
you ever actually been in there miles
i dont have to
turning the wheel i say we check it out
you never know
the saab finds a place in the large parking lot
a tour bus whose flank reads solvang wine tours is in the process of letting out wine tourists many of them elderly
the room boasts not only a large tasting bar but also display after display of t shirts golf shirts olive oils chocolate sauces and other gourmet tourist items emblazoned with
the winerys logo
in the corner an acoustic guitarist with a small amp plays soothing windham hill ish music
the tasting bar is packed three deep with tasters attended to by harried pourers
finally the pourer gets to their glasses
miles chews a sip and swallows then downs the rest in a single gulp
tastes like the back of a fucking la schoolbus
probably didnt de stem hoping for some semblance of concentration crushed it up with leaves and mice wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit
i dont know
tastes okay to me
looking at the tasting sheet hey they got a reserve pinot
let me use your phone
handing it over whats up
i cant take it anymore
ive got to call evelyn
walking across the lawn outside miles holds the cellphone to his ear
evelyn berman silvermans office
hi its miles
oh hi miles
let me see if i can get her
a moment later youre in luck
ill put you through
hey evelyn its your favorite client
hows the trip
drinking some good wines and kicking back you know
so whats happening
still no word
actually there is word
i spoke to keith kurtzman this morning
he said they really liked it
they really wanted to do it but they just couldnt figure out how to market it
he said it was a tough call
im sorry miles
off his silence so i dont know where that leaves us
im not sure how much more mileage i can get out of continuing to submit it
i think its one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now a fabulous book with no home
the whole industrys gotten gutless
its not about the quality of the books
its about the marketing
miles is at a loss for words
a distant rumble begins to sound the familiar harbinger of an anxiety attack
once again we see the narrow rope bridge extending vertiginously across a great chasm
are you there
yeah im here
im sorry miles
we did all we could
youve been a real trooper
loudly to her assistant tell him ill call back
so i guess thats it
youre a wonderful writer miles
dont be discouraged
miles staggers toward the tasting room unpocketing his xanax and downing a couple as evelyns cliches of consolation continue in his head
just hang in there and who knows
after you get something else published we can revisit this one
and next time we can try a different title
once back at the tent he leans against it in a vain attempt to steady himself
the rumble grows deafening
now inside miles grabs the first dirty wine glass he finds and shakes it out as he approaches the closest tasting station
he pushes his way to front
the pourer offers the usual one ounce dollop
miles jacks it back immediately extending his glass for more
hit me again
the same small amount is poured and downed
once again miles holds out his glass
pour me a full glass
ill pay for it
this is a tasting sir
not a bar
miles slams a twenty dollar bill on the table
just give me a full goddamn pour
the pourer turns away to serve another party
miles looks around indignantly as though everyone should be sympathetic to this injustice
now miles boldly reaches over and pours himself a glass right up to the brim and beyond
sir what are you doing
i told you i need a drink
then buy a bottle and go outside
the pourer grabs miles by the wrist before he can drink
put the glass down
in the ensuing struggle the wine spills and everyone nearby steps back
youre going to have to leave sir
the pourer signals to a security guy at the door
across the room jack notices the disturbance and heads over
miles hoists up the spit bucket holds it aloft and starts to guzzle it
wine cascades down the sides of his face onto his shirt and even onto his shiny new shoes
the security guy yanks the bucket away from miles and drags him toward the exit
jack catches up
to the horrified onlookers its all right
his mother just died
two pelicans soar low over the water
one of the dives crashing into the water and disappearing from view
jack and miles sit on the hood of the saab gazing at the ocean sharing a bottle of wine
just write another one
you have lots of ideas right
no im finished
im not a writer
im a middle school english teacher
im going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others
i like books
the world doesnt give a shit what i have to say
a dark laugh im so insignificant i cant even kill myself
whats that supposed to mean
you know hemingway sexton woolf plath delmore schwartz
you cant kill yourself before youve even been published
what about that guy who wrote confederacy of dunces
he committed suicide before he got published and look how famous he is
dont give up
youre going to make it
half my life is over and i have nothing to show for it
im a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper
im a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage
just what you just said
a thumbprint on a skyscraper
i couldnt write that
neither could i
i think its bukowski
unable to respond jack looks up and down the beach
there goes the saab
the camera lingers behind and pans to reveal the dead dog now covered with flies and maggots
jack and miles pull into the parking lot
lighting up oh look
he smiles broadly and honks his horn
miles turns to see seated halfway up on the motel stairs her helmet in her lap watching patiently as pulls to a stop in a parking space
miles masks his concern as he gets out of the car and reaches in the backseat for his sears bag
calling out hey baby
stephanie stands up and slowly descends the steps as jack reaches into the trunk and pulls out a big cuddly lion doll
look what i got for our favorite girl
stephanie walks toward jack as he waddles toward her hugging the lion
when they get close stephanies face transforms with rage
she swings her helmet and hits jack full in the face
jack falls blood spraying out of his nose
stephanie stands over him and continues to beat him with her helmet as he rolls back and forth protecting his head with the stuffed lion
miles ineffectually attempts to stop her dancing just out of range
you fucking bastard
lying piece of shit
youre getting married on saturday
what was all that shit you said to me
i can explain
you said you loved me
i hope you die
with that she backs away
glancing at her bloodied helmet she tosses it onto the pavement before getting on her bike
to miles you too
as she speeds away miles is left to comfort his wounded friend
the lion lies nearby staring blankly at the sky
seated in the passenger seat and in great agony jack presses a blood soaked towel against his face
arent you glad you didnt move up here and marry her
dont need a lecture
you fucking told maya didnt you
no i did not
must have been gary at the hitching post
i think we mentioned it to him the first night
you told him
im fucking hurting here
keep it elevated
close on a cosmopolitan open to an article titled ways to please your man
miles reads while nearby a young boy dry heaves into a garbage can held by his father
an old woman parked in a wheelchair faces the wall
miles is at a payphone
as he speaks he tries to peel off the metal long distance sticker
please leave a message
listen i dont know if you even care but i had to call and tell you again how much i enjoyed our time together and how sorry i am things
turned out the way they did
i think youre great maya always have
from the first time you waited on me
bracing himself and while im at it i guess you should know that my book is not getting published
i thought this one had a chance but i was wrong
dont bother reading it youve got better things to do
so you see im not much of a writer
im not anything really
the only real talent i seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand
were leaving in the morning and i want you to know that i take with me wonderful memories of you
im really sorry
what else to say
he hangs up
he returns to his seat
a moment later he extends his legs to look at his new shoes now stained with wine
jack emerges unsteadily from the bowels of the emergency room his face purple and swollen beneath the huge white bandage that holds the noseguard in place
miles walks with him toward the exit
im going to need an operation
maybe a couple of them
they have to wait for it it to heal first
then they break it again
good thing you have a voice over career
gonna fuck that up too
i should sue her ass
only reason i wont is to protect christine
they walk by us and out the door
jack sits in the saabs passenger side with the seat almost fully reclined
when his agony allows him to open his eyes he glares at the danish themed stores lining the street
an abelskiver maker plies his lofty trade in a nearby window
he hears a strange clomping noise and turns his head to see a man in wooden clogs walking noisily down the street dressed in a traditional danish costume and carrying
jack takes a slug of wine
just then miles gets back in the car
i hate this place
miles tears open a paper bag and removes a bottle of pills
a closer angle reveals them as vicodin
take a couple of these and youll learn to love it
miles opens the bottle and hands jack two pills
two for you
and two for me
jack washes down the pills and passes the bottle to miles who follows suit
jack and miles sit across from each other
for the first time we see large purple bruises on jacks arms and chest
so how did stephanie know it was saturday
we didnt get into that with gary
let me think
you sure you didnt say anything to maya
sure im sure
and just what are you implying
im really pissed off at you about all this if you want to know the truth
whats maya going to think of me now just for associating with you
youre the one whos sabotaging me not the other way around pal
not by a longshot
jack takes a long lie detecting look at miles
i dont know
just seems fishy
the boys lie on their respective beds staring at the tv
jack gets up and lumbers slowly to the dresser mirror like a large dog who has just been neutered
whats it look like to you
looks like you were in a bad car accident
jack turns to miles nodding and thinking
then he looks back in the mirror
thursday night is cajun wings night
miles and jack are finishing their salads in the rustic themed restaurant festooned with animal trophies
you know what im thinking
im thinking its time to settle down
jack nods his head with no self awareness or acknowledgment of the irony
mounded high with ribs slaw beans and butter whipped mashed potatoes
their cheery saftig blonde waitress removes several foil packets from her apron and places them on the table
and herere your handi wipes
oh so thats what those are
for a second there i thought you guys were promoting safe sex
the waitress over laughs and swipes a hand at her naughty customer
ill be right back with more corn bread
jack watches her go and leans in close to miles
i bet you that chick is two tons of fun
you know the grateful type
i dont know
i wouldnt know
now she comes back toward the table carrying a big basket
beneath the hideous uniform her nylons sh sh sh as she walks
when she arrives she replenishes their corn bread basket using big tongs
jack watches attentively
nice technique there
checking her name tag cammi
its all in the wrist
a moment later you know you look really familiar
you from around here
whered you go to high school
no were from san diego
i dont know
you just seem really familiar to me
enjoy your meals
did you ever know a derek sommersby
doctor derek sommersby
you mean from one life to live
miles looks away and sighs
you have to imagine him with a bandage and shorter hair
as cammi stares at jack her face transforms in astonishment
jack smiles and nods
oh my god
could you tell me where the bathroom is
her eyes barely leaving jack uh sure its right over there right past the buffalo
miles gets up and heads toward the bathroom as jacks flirtation with cammi continues
the camera pans with miles as he walks by us and goes through the bathroom door which closes behind him filling the frame with the word men
a toothpick dispenser as a finger tips it forward to dispense one
miles stands by the cash register and picks his teeth as he watches jack finish speaking with cammi and head his way
she gets off in an hour so i think im just going to have a drink and then
make sure she gets home safe
youre joking right
seeing that he isnt what are you doing
un fucking believeable
can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home
jack rests one hand on miless shoulder and drops his head thinking how best to put it
i know youre my friend and you care about me
and i know you disapprove
i respect that
but there are some things i have to do that you dont understand
you understand wine and literature and movies but you dont understand my plight
and thats okay
as the disappointment in his friend deepens by the moment
now comes the sound of hysterical knocking
despite the knocking miles remains motionless in bed his expression serene
finally he awakens and drags himself toward the door opening it to find silhouetted against the first rosy fingers of dawn
he is barefoot
in fact he is clad only in his underwear
hugging himself he pants and shivers
jesus fucking christ its freezing
he limps past miles yanks off the bed covers and wraps them around himself
wheres the vicodin
miles hands him the bottle and jack frantically pops a couple of pills chewing them like candy
he sits down and bends over at the waist as though preparing for an airplane crash
fucking chicks married
her husband works a night shift or something and he comes home and im on the floor with my cock in his wifes ass
and you walked all the way back from solvang
twisted my ankle too
thats five clicks jackson
fucking a its five clicks
at one point i had to cut through an ostrich farm
fuckers are mean
miles has now awakened to take in the absurdity of the whole scene and he laughs hard
the blanketed bulge just sits there
finally it looks up and shows its pitiful visage
we gotta go back
i left my wallet
my credit cards cash fucking id everything
we gotta go back
well call right now and cancel your cards
you dont understand
the wedding bands
the wedding bands are in my wallet
okay so they were in your wallet and you left your wallet somewhere
she ordered them special
took her forever to find them
theyve got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in sanskrit
weve got to go back
christinell fucking crucify me
a pitiful whine please miles please
your wallet was stolen at a bar
happens every day
jack stares straight ahead breathing through his mouth as he considers this
then no weve got to get my wallet
those rings are irreplaceable
weve got to get them miles
i fucked up
i know i fucked up okay
i fucked up
you gotta help me
you gotta help me
jack now descends to a level of wretchedness and desperation that miles has never seen before in jack or in anyone else for that matter
oh god please
i know im bad
i know i did a bad thing
help me miles
just this one thing this one last thing
i cant lose christine
im nothing without her
please miles please
no longer able to form words jack is reduced to emitting low primitive sounds
snot flows from beneath his bandaged nose
miles drives in the early morning light
jack is now subdued quieted by his pain and exhaustion
she tell you she was married
so what the fuck were you thinking
wasnt supposed to be back till six
fucker rolls in at five
cutting it a little close dont you think
off jacks silence so how was she
compared to stephanie say
horny as shit
flopping around like a landed trout
the saab creeps around a corner
jack scans the street
yeah this is the block
just keep going
spotting an amc pacer yeah
this is it
theres her car
miles pulls over and cuts the engine
so whats the plan
the plan is
just go explain the situation
sarcastic clearing his throat uh excuse me sir but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago and he seems to have left his wallet behind
and we were wondering
just like that
miles gives jack a withering look
jack reaches for the door fuck you
ill get it myself
grabbing jacks shirt hold on
miles crosses the street and approaches miles presses his ear against the front door
then he notices a sliding glass door a few feet away just barely cracked open
miles creeps over sticks his hand into the open space and pulls back the curtain to reveal a living room the is hideously messy
draped over a deformed beanbag chair are jacks levis
miles gathers his courage carefully slides open the glass door and creeps inside
a furtive search of jacks pockets reveals nothing
then miles notices a high pitched sound wafting from an open door down a short hallway
miles feverishly begins foraging through the debris on the floor
meanwhile the noise from the bedroom grows louder female moaning in odd rhythmic unison with a miles gets on all fours and starts crawling weaving his way through a trail
of shoes and clothes
nearing the open door the sounds grow more distinct you dont think i fuck you bitch
ill fuck you
im a bad girl
im a bad girl
miles peers around the corner of the open door to see cammi is tied to the faux brass headboard
a big guy slams away at her
in the corner a soundless tv shows a presidential you picked him up and you fucked him didnt you bitch
i picked him up and i fucked him
im a bad girl
and you liked fucking him didnt you you fat little whore
i liked it when you caught me fucking him
miles manages to tear his eyes away from this nature documentary and scan the room
to the wallet atop the dresser
miless eyes dart back and forth between the couple and the wallet
his heart beating loudly he goes for it
he scrambles to his feet dashes across the room seizes the wallet and tears out
behind him he hears the fuck was that
he took dereks wallet
miles comes flying out of the sliding glass door followed swiftly by the man who is of course stark naked
and hes fast for a man his size
jack is reclined in the passenger seat fast asleep
on the radio nprs carl kassel reads the news
miles comes sprinting towards us mere steps ahead of cammis naked husband
finding the car door locked miles knocks loudly on the glass startling jack awake
open the goddamn door
jack flips the electric locks just in time for miles to get in before whump
the guys belly hits the window
he pounds on the roof before trying the door now re locked
ill kill you
ill kill you motherfuckers
miles starts the car and begins to drive away
the guy tries to keep up but cant running barefoot on asphalt
jack turns to look the guy recedes in the distance
removes the rings from the wallet
you did it
you fucking did it
they laugh and slap hands
for all his failures this time he did something right
the shades are drawn
jack is crashed out on the bed snoring loudly
miles folds his shirts and trousers readying his bags for departure
at one moment he stops and watches his friend sleep
a knock at the door
miles goes to answer it but once his hand is on the knob he pauses
if were perceptive we will know hes hoping against hope that its maya
he opens it
its just the maid with her big cart
the saab enters the freeway and heads south
miles drives while jack stares out the window watching the landscape change as they leave wine country
that was quite a day yesterday
jacks eyes close but his lips spread into a smile
quite a day
quite a week
a driving shot
miles pumps the gas while nearby jack stretches his legs
as miles puts the nozzle back in place want me to drive
no im okay
hey why dont you invite maya to the wedding
somehow i dont think inviting maya to your wedding is the right move
in fact after your bullshit its going to be hard for me to even go to the hitching post again
youre so negative
miles replaces the hose and screws on the gas cap
come on let me drive
i feel like driving
as the car makes its way back toward the freeway jack looks over at miles and slows the car to a stop
buckle up okay
without hesitation jack accelerates and jumps the curb heading into the saab plows into a tree
what the fuck
pointing at his face you said it looked like a car accident
what the fuck
ill pay for it
they get out to inspect the damage
the hood is slightly crumpled and the front fender is bent
look at this
i dont know
doesnt look like anybody got hurt in this one
no you dont
you need a new car anyway
miles looks at his friend incredulous
i said id pay for it
the trunk is open and the guys are unloading their cases of wine
miles notices that one box is dripping
you broke some
no not whatever
you fucking derelict
miles looks on as jack hoists a foundation block toward the open drivers door of the saab
miles waves his hand in a gesture of get it over with
grunting with effort jack leans inside the car and drops the foundation block onto the gas pedal
jack leaps backward and hits the dirt just in time
miles and jack watch the driverless saab race toward the tree its speed increasing
but just before hitting it the car drifts to one side and sails right past
the car zooms wildly across the vacant lot and missing the tree continues on until crashing through a fence and finally toppling headlong into a cement trench
only the back of the car remains visible
the whole thing is finished in a matter of seconds
still frozen in place miles and jack turn slowly to each other
ive got triple a
from in front of the saab we see its now crumpled hood and fender a couple of bungee cords holding the whole thing together
the saab approaches the end of the line
miles has helped jack carry his bags and the wine
he plops the last case down
that about does it
why dont you come in
youre on your own
so ill see you at the rehearsal
they give each other a brief manly back slappy hug
love you man
back at you
miles heads toward the curb
hey dont pull away till they see the car
over his shoulder yeah
turning around hey why wasnt i injured
big smile you were wearing your belt
miles gets in and watches through the side window as mrs
erganian opens the front door and welcomes jack with shock and dismay
jack points back at miles raising one hand in a feeble wave
the camera slowly moves closer as he continues to watch weaving his story of woe
hes a great actor when he wants to be
erganian and a mortified christine come to the door too
erganian takes a few steps toward the car to get a better look
watching the drama play out
then his eyes drop as he momentarily loses himself in melancholy
this reverie is interrupted by startled miles turns to look at who is singing the blessing of the rings
we are now in the church is packed
close on the rings as the priest holds them aloft
if those rings could talk
jack shoots a quick look at miles who looks right back
the priest continues his blessing
the wedding families greet the exiting guests in a receiving line
smiling and exuberant jack seems utterly at home as the new groom
miles watches the scene not without melancholy
then hey miles
miles turns and looks up to see victoria standing one step above him
just behind her is her new husband
he exudes the quiet confidence of a successful businessman who played college football takes expensive skiing and sailing vacations and hasnt read a novel since high school
taking her in you look beautiful
um this is ken cortland my husband
from his spot hovering over miles ken leans down and offers his hand
how are you
how you doing
youre a lucky guy
to victoria ill wait for you at the car
to miles nice to meet you miles
that was big of him
yeah hes good that way
so howre you doing
since the last time we spoke
i dont know
could be better
could be worse
so whats happening with your book
what are you going to do
back to the drawing board i guess
you look happy
seems like everyones getting married
a year ago it was all divorces
now its all weddings
cyclical i guess
just then a black lincoln navigator pulls up alongside the curb
the passenger side window is halfway down and the sounds of adult contemporary jazz waft out
victoria gives ken a little wave
shifting gears well lets go have some champagne shall we
toast all the newlyweds
im not drinking
you quit drinking
hit in the solar plexus oh
rallying congratulations again vicki
thats wonderful news
going to the car see you over there miles
as she gets in the car and cruises away miles glances back at where mike erganian is introducing jack to some dear old friends
mike throws a loving arm around his new son in law and jack is drawn into mikes bosom
a hand painted sign attached to a stop sigh and decorated with balloons reads reception this way
with an arrow pointing right
one by one cars are making a right turn
but when his turn comes miles turns left
the saab pull up outside
miles leaves the car idling as he sprints inside
moments later he sprints back to his car this time carrying something
his bowtie undone miles sits at a booth eating
he washes down a bite by draining the contents of a big wax coated soft drink cup
he brings the cup to his lap and refills it from a bottle of wine hidden next to him
as he sets the bottle back down we glimpse the label cheval blanc
he takes another sip
as the camera moves closer all the complex emotions inspired by the wine ripple across miless face
the marrow of his bone i repeated aimlessly
this at least penetrated my mind
phineas had died from the marrow of his bone flowing down his blood stream to his heart
the voice belongs to one of miless pupils reading aloud in class
other students follow along silently from their own copies of a separate peace
miles sits behind his desk at the front of the class
i did not cry then or ever about finny
i did not cry even when i stood watching him being lowered into his familys straight laced burial ground outside of boston
i could not escape a feeling that this was my own funeral and you do not cry in that case
the students look up
do you want me to keep reading the next chapter mr
as though coming to hrnrnrn
no well pick up there on monday
miles enters his tiny apartment
he loosens his tie and puts down his satchel
on his way to the kitchen he presses a button on his answering machine
as it plays he opens the refrigerator and looks inside
one new message
miles freezes not wanting to miss a single syllable
thanks for your letter
i would have called you sooner but i think ive needed some time to think about everything that happened and what you wrote to me
another reason i didnt call sooner is that i wanted to finish your book which i finally did last night
miless heart pounds
i think its really lovely miles
youre so good with words
who cares if its not getting published
there are so many beautiful and painful things about it
did you really go through all that
it must have been awfully hard
and the sister character jesus what a wreck
but i have to say i was really confused by the ending
did the father finally commit suicide or what
its driving me crazy
and the title
we see ourselves taking the buellton exit
anyway its turned cold and rainy here lately
but i like winter
so listen if you ever do decide to come up here again you should let me know
i would say stop by the hitching post but to tell you the truth im not sure how much longer im going to be working there
im going to graduate soon so ill probably relocate
miles climbs the wooden steps and approaches mayas back door
anyway like i said i really loved your novel
dont give up miles
youre really good
hope youre well
miles takes a breath
finally he knocks
