b if window
href b b by roselyne bosch september we start on a mans elegant slipper
he is seated in a splendid chair
moving up the stocking leg we pass the garter of castile coming to rest on a pair of delicate hands
his fore finger impatiently plays with a large topaz ring
over this we hear distant footsteps echoing on marble floors
a castilian face aquilaine profile olive complexion dark eyebrows and meticulously sculpted beard
this is a door slams somewhere the footsteps getting closer
we can now here a subdued conversation
treasurer sanchez stands up as the door opens at the far end of the large gilded room
a women magnificent in somber taffeta enters
queen isabel of spain moves towards him
he bows slightly as she sits at the end of the large table
she is followed by a priest brother buyl and three dignitaries of church and state
all sit beside her
treasurer sanchez takes a document and starts to read aloud
on screen the words granada spain your majesty would wish to know the true facts concerning the island of hispanola our first settlement in the new world and the activities
there of your servant christopher columbus admiral of the ocean sea governor of that island
you will remember with what hopes and promises he beguiled us the truth is that he now presides over a state of chaos degradation and madness beyond imagining
sanchez punctuates each word carefully
from the beginning columbus proved himself incapable of managing the affairs of the island
he appointed his brothers to important positions at once injuring the pride and dignity of the nobles who had gone with him
he promised to build a city the city of isabel named after your majesty
what he actually built was nothing but a collection of huts and that in the wrong place for all of it was easily swept away by rain and mud
is that not so brother buyl
the priest nods
yes your honor
he promised gold
not finding the easy quantities he promised columbus commanded each indian to pay an annual tribute
most being unable to they were barbarously punished against the express wish of your christian majesties
isabel lowers her eyes
since provocation and injustice never ceases many of the indians have fled to the forests or have begun to slay the christians
isabel looks over at brother buyl
could it be so
yes your majesty
but there is worse
from the beginning he forced the nobles to undergo physical labor treating them equally with the indians all of them reduced to slavery
when the nobleman adrian de moxica protested against such treatment
he pauses he was executed
pause is that not true also brother buyl
yes your honor
it is all true
all of it
i saw it with my own eyes
he has lost control
his great arrogance has led him into depravity
he encourages our soldiers to marry the native women
he promised a paradise but he has made a hell full of all its horrors
is that the man i knew treasurer sanchez
yes your majesty
close on the face columbus is stretched on a bed sweating heavily in fever clearly delirious
insects crawl over his face he makes no effort to swat them away
there is a dripping sound of water
of all the words my father wrote and there were many i remember these the most
nothing that results from human progress is achieved with unanimous consent
rain is falling into the room over documents spread on a table
columbus stands up and moves to the table
some of the walls have been blackened with smoke and flames
a lizard scuttles into the shadows
and those who are enlightened before the others are condemned to purse that light in spite of others
columbus stares down at the documents moving them away from the rain drips
he stares out by the window and we see a devastated landscape
flooded roads half destroyed huts broken trees
a dog picks its way through the mud
there was a time when the new world didnt exist
a vast stretch of ocean
it fills the screen
unbroken infinite luminous mysterious it stretches away meeting and blending with the sky in pale ribbons of pearl and misty light
the sun set in the west on an ocean where no man had dared to venture
and beyond that infinity
pulling back we discover a ten year old boy and a strongly built man in his middle thirties are riding a mule
the mans weather beaten face frames unusually bright eyes
on the screen these words andalusia columbus and his son are following a windthrashed path at the top of the hill
columbus hums a song and fernando looks up at him in adoration
once i asked my father where he wanted to go
and he replied i want to travel all over the seas
i want to get behind the weather
he then starts to hum along with his a rugged landscape remote and steep with lines of stone walls and thousands of sheep
fernando rushes down a slope barking like a dog chasing the sheep who fan out in droves in front of him
high spirited and wild fernando laughs and tumbles over
columbus rides his mule along the narrow track watching his sons antics with amusement
in the distance the solitary figure of a monk shepherd
columbus calls out to his son fernando
fernando runs over
columbus lifts him up onto the mule
as they move along the track we now see perched on a distant hill isolated and austere the monastery of la rabida their destination
as they dismount and walk into the quiet cloisters fernando suddenly spots a familiar figure standing under the roman arches
he rushes over full of joy to kiss his brother an adolescent dressed in the novice robe with a solemn delicate face
diegos response is constrained
arent you going to kiss your brother
diego smiles a little and kisses fernando who is immediately distracted by a procession of hooded monks hurrying to the refectory as a bell begins to chime
the monks all turn to greet antonio de marchena a white haired elderly man and a monk cosmographer
marchenas gesture is broad and elegant as he opens his arms to greet columbus
he pats fernandos head and turns to diego
diego take fernando to the dining hall
he must be hungry
both children leave under the arched roof
columbus and marchena begin to walk across the cloister
diego is a bright boy a pleasure to teach but so serious
brothers should be raised together colon
even brothers from different mothers
father i am doing what i think is the best for him
and he has the teacher i would have chosen for myself
marchena laughs at the compliment
just be careful you dont lose him
they have crossed the cloister
marchena pushes open a door
hundreds of books lined up on the shelves displaying the miracle of printing a recent german discovery
several monks perched on high stools behind lecterns are busily illuminating some of these massive volumes delicately painting around the letters in bright colors and gold leaf
rays of light fall diagonally through high openings projecting geometric patterns on the tiled floor
as marchena and columbus move forward their conversation is punctuated by light and shadow
fumbles in a pocket under his robe i have something for you
almost casually he hands columbus a letter
you will be heard at the university of salamanca
columbus stops dead in his tracks
almost frantically he tears open the letter hardly able to believe his eyes
thats in a week
thats what it says
how did you manage it
smiling with some difficulty
i had to promise them you were not a total fool
marchena pushes open a second door hidden behind a wooden panel
marchena is not a tidy man
books are piled up on the floor the desk on every shelf along with maps instruments of astronomy
the visible evidence of an inquiring mind
with practiced familiarity as if they had done this a hundred times which indeed they have marchena sits behind his desk and columbus opposite him
marchena lights a candle and considers the mess
then methodically he slowly sweeps it from in front of him with his sleeve exposing a large map underneath
when he looks up again there is a new severity in his expression
he turns over an hourglass
why do you wish to sail west
to open a new route to asia
at the moment there are only two ways of reaching it
he leans forward and points to the map spread out on the desk
by sea sailing around the african continent the journey takes a year
his finger traces the journey from west to east
or by land
we are close now on the map as we watch his finger tracing a line between europe and the far east
but the turks have closed this route to all christians
trading with the orient has become arduous if not dangerous
he pauses there is a third way
we notice that the outline of the european continent is familiar
but we also notice that in that great expanse of ocean the whole american continent is missing
by sailing west across the ocean sea
close on marchenas face touched by the mystery
how can you be so certain
the ocean is said to be infinite
i believe the indies are no more than leagues west of the canary islands
how can you be so certain
the calculations of toscanelli marin de tyr esdras
interrupting esdras is a jew
so was christ
marchena throws his quill in the air in frustration
he glances at the hourglass two minutes
and already youre a dead man
dont let passion overwhelm you colon
mockingly ill try to remember that marchena
ignoring this passion is something one cannot control
heatedly you get so carried away when you are being contradicted
ive been contradicted all my life
amused only god knows the meaning of such words my son
diego and fernando wait in the courtyard
columbus appears and lifts fernando onto the mule
diego turns to go
columbus walks over to him squats down so their eyes meet
he looks at his son for a moment
would you like to come and stay with us
uncomfortable with the proposition diego cannot find an answer
ill do whatever makes you happy
i am happy father
columbus reaches out and touches his shoulder
he climbs up behind fernando who waves back to his brother as they ride off
columbus leads the mule carrying the sleeping fernando through narrow streets
theres a clamorous noise in the air
suddenly a large group of young men shouting with excitement run up the street and brush past them
then more people
fernando sits up straight
the noise grows rowdy rumbling sharp with excitement and violence
huge crowds have thronged the massive old square outside the cathedral
holding the mule by its reins columbus tries to push his way through
suddenly as a gap opens in the crowd we see the cause of the excitement in the center of the square stand three pyres already alit
hooded executioners are busy around the fires
before columbus can stop him fernando has slipped off the mule and into the crowd
but the boy has been swallowed into the mass of people
columbus tries to follow him
flames leap into the night sky with a terrible crackling lighting up the square with a lurid glow
prayers are being chanted somewhere
fernando has elbowed his way to the front of the crowd
a priest brandishes a crucifix in front of the face of a man bound to a post
the heretic wears the sambenito a robe made of coarse fabric on which his sins have been crudely illustrated we see cabalistic signs indicating that the man is jewish
the mans eyes are mad with fear
but he refuses to kiss the crucifix as a sign of his repentance
fernando is transfixed by the scene but still doesnt realize what is happening
he is too close to the platform to see what is in the flames of the other pyres
he motions to his son takes the boys hand and drags him away from the scene
but fernando looks back
the distance now allows him to see inside the flames
a half charred figure the mans face is distorted in a silent scream
the neck snaps like burning wood and the head falls on one shoulder
then the whole body collapses into the fire
columbus and fernando lead the mule into the white washed stone floored hallway of the modest house
fernando is mute shocked by what he just witnessed
columbus takes the mule into its stall and as he does so his mother beatrix appears from the kitchen to greet them
she is a beautiful woman in her twenties a calm strong domestic personality
columbus tousles the boys hair
fernando glances at his mother but looks subdued and doesnt say anything
columbus joins beatrix in the kitchen where a maid is cooking
he explains fernandos subdued manner
in the square
he goes to the stone butt and pours water on his hands
theyve agreed to see me in a week
beatrix puts the candle on the table
her face lights up with a smile
he walks to her and kisses her
i could be gone for years
i havent given you much of a life
i have a child by a man who wont marry me
whos always leaving
are we going to argue
id love to argue with you sometimes
but youre never here
they laugh and kiss
perhaps i was never meant to live with a woman
still kissing him i find that hard to believe
they are eating around the table and fernando is unusually silent and thoughtful
columbus pours a little wine into fernandos water to distract him
fernando looks up at him surprised
columbus smiles then looks over at beatrix
fernando dont you think we are lucky to live with such a beautiful woman
he winks at fernando
the room is dark
as columbus approached the bed with a candle it illuminates the naked body of beatrix
beatrix looks up at him intently
a drop of wax falls on her skin
she flinches murmurs
they make love
a medieval campus
students novices are playing pelote with basket gloves and a hard ball
they run with their robes tucked around their waist revealing white legs
others are studying reading hurrying to their class
we find columbus watching the game from the steps above the court
others are waiting with him
a monk comes from a door and looks around the group
hesitant christopher columbus
an el greco painting
a tableau of twenty men sitting on dark sculpted seats
candles throw a gloomy light on their faces
some are churchmen others are dressed in bourgeois outfits
only one of them is richly dressed in the grand spanish fashion he is sanchez treasurer of the house of aragon
a monk don arojaz holds a stick with an ivory claw at the top
languidly he scratches his back his off hand manner only makes him more impressive than his peers
you say asia can be found by sailing west
yes your eminence
the voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks
unfortunately don colon that is precisely where our opinions differ
pause are you familiar with the work of aristotle
i am your eminence then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations the circumference of the earth is approximately
he leans forward leagues or more
which makes the ocean
he leans back satisfied and pauses for effect
but you may have found new evidence proving that these men of knowledge are totally mistaken
a ripple of mirthless laughter
your excellencies are aware of the statements of marin de tyr
then you are also aware that his theories contradict ptolemeus
de tyr believes the ocean to be only leagues
a murmur of protest spreads among the members of the commission
but columbus is determined to press his theories
the florentine toscanelli and the french cardinal pierre dailly both think that marin de tyr is accurate in his calculations
and therefore that the ocean can be crossed
indignant and amused murmurs
diego de deza raises his voice to quiet the assembly
gentlemen let us suppose marin de tyr is right
the laughter subsides are we here to examine this proposal or not
to columbus in your opinion how long would the voyage be
six during the summer months
the murmur increases
marin de tyr is wrong and has been corrected many times over the centuries by the finest geographers
your voyage don colon would take a year
a man of simple bearing that columbus identifies as being a seaman interrupts
how would the crew survive without being able to land for fresh water
water is undrinkable after six weeks
youd never be able to turn back
we wouldnt have to turn back
we would find land at this point
senor colon an experienced captain such as yourself will understand our concern with the crew
i am not willing to have on my conscience the loss of men who would have relied upon our judgment
excellency you are right
instantly the protests stop
i am a seaman not a scholar
but as a simple man craving for knowledge i have read all the work of these renowned geographers and discovered that none of them could agree on the exact width
of this ocean
he pauses and starts walking in front of the experts as a lawyer before a grand jury
therefore as a modest man i wonder who is right
the experts listen
close on sanchezs face impressed by the boldness
who is right
this question remains unanswered
he walks and stops before talavera and catches the look of sanchez sitting just behind him
your eminence there is only one way to settle the matter
and that is to make the journey
to the assembly with passion i am ready to risk my life to prove it possible
your life and that of others
if they agree to follow me yes
suppose you cross this ocean
suppose you reach asia
what would spain do there
conscious of a friendlier voice columbus sees the treasurer sanchez an imposing man in his fifties
trade your excellency
according to marco polo the kingdom of china is one of the richest of the world
even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold
interrupting is that all that interests you
the portuguese have already discovered black skinned people
i too will find other populations and bring them to the word of god
the monk smiles thinly
christopher christo ferens the bearer of the cross
ironic and colon the one who populates
another small rill of laughter
if god intended our proximity to asia do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world
did he not choose a carpenters son to reveal himself to the world
a hum of interest
close on sanchez watching columbus intently a hint of an admiring smile on his lips
so you consider yourself the chosen one
dont you realize your words could be considered heretical
calmly blind faith is what i consider heresy
the murmur turns to an audible gasp
arojaz gets to his feet and leans forward threateningly the flame of a candle only inches from his face
there is absolute silence
columbus meets the monks gaze unflinchingly
quietly asia can be found to the west and i will prove it
the jury is alone to deliberate
food and wine has been laid out on tables
in the distance students cries carry over the conversation
the treasurer of spain honors us with his presence
sanchez bows slightly
the state has some reason to be interested in this mans proposition your eminence
the judgment is ours
but i would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for spain for a
dispute over a point of geography
sanchez helps himself to some grapes looks round at the other members of the committee who pretend not to be listening
interrupting he is a mercenary
did he not already try to convince the king of portugal of his absurd notions
the world is full of mercenaries and states often make use of them when it benefits them
casually my only concern is the welfare and prosperity of spain
arojaz understands the hint and stops smiling
you would use your influence to assist this
sanchez reaches for a decanter of sherry
you know your eminence the fascinating thing about power is that what can be given so effortlessly
he offers the decanter to arojaz who automatically lifts his glass
but instead sanchez pulls back the decanter pours himself a drink and replaces it on the table leaving arojaz staring at his own empty glass
can so easily be taken away
and he drinks with a smile
marchena reads aloud the commissions letter
and therefore nothing could justify the participation of your highnesses in the venture that relies upon such feeble assumptions and which any man of knowledge would take to be impractical
if not impossible
he shakes his head puts the letter down
columbus looks appalled devastated
they didnt listen
they didnt want to listen
he paces about the book lined room
you mustnt give way to despair
you must wait
ive waited seven years already
how much longer do you want me to wait
if god intends you to go then you will go
angrily damn god
marchena is shocked
damn all of you
you all set up theories based on what
you never leave the safety of your studies
find out what the world is about and then tell me something i can listen to
he seizes a beautiful book from marchenas desk
these dont mean anything
theyre full of assumptions
out of the heads of old men whove never been past the end of their gardens
he hurls the book across the room
marchena is horrified
columbus seizes more books from the shelves just sweeping them to the floor
all of them
marchena tries to stop him
in his fury columbus accidentally knocks the poor old man to the ground
his cries bring three monks rushing into the room
as columbus continues to rage and scatter books everywhere they try to stop him struggling with this big powerful man to almost comical effect
finally a short muscular monk delivers a quick punch that sends columbus crashing to the floor
columbus lies face down on the stone floor
he is dressed in a homespun robe
his arms are stretched out in penance
fernando and diego look down at him
one cant speak to a man doing penance
what can you do
thats the point fernando
a pause and then fernando lies face down on the floor beside his father and stretches out his arms in the same way
diego is left looking on unable to bring himself to join them
along the cloister maps are drying hanging like laundry in the light breeze
columbus pins up a new addition
another monk works nearby in silence
columbus turns to see a small stocky man approaching a middle class gentleman
ah thank god
ive been looking all over seville for you
never expected to find a sailor in a monastery eh
columbus smiles but doesnt say anything
pinzon is clearly a little surprised
names pinzon by the way
martin alonzo pinzon
im a ship owner from palos
columbus glances around cautiously and walks a little way down the cloister away from the other monk gesturing for pinzon to follow him
pinzon is yet more surprised by this strange behavior
indicating the monk is he a spy
columbus shakes his head
pinzon stares at him perplexed
what is it
are you a trappist
columbus shakes his head again
vow of silence
columbus nods vigorously
just my luck
he takes off his hat wiping his forehead with a silk cloth
ill do the talking for both of us
you just nod
just as i do with the wife
i know that the commission turned you down right
what do you expect
youre a foreigner
but i want to help you
columbus gives him a glance like one throws a question in the air
you wonder why i believe in you
hey i am a seaman
and we dont like to be told where to go and where not to go
columbus looks at him and bursts out laughing
the other monk looks round severely
columbus ducks behind a map pinzon following him
pinzon lowers his voice
i dont look like it but i have friends at the court
the treasurer of aragon for example
he finances me
his names santangel
ever heard of him
columbus shakes his head but looks increasingly interested by what hes hearing
he can get you an audience with the queen
you know why
she owes him money
thats how it is
you me the queen the world and his mistress agreed
what do you say
columbus looks around catches the disapproving face of the monk crosses himself then speaks where can i meet this man
indicating with a nod immediately
columbus turns and sees an elegant lord in his fifties examining the maps
a huge islamic crescent being pulled down from the minaret of a mosque
soldiers are holding back a crowd at the foot of the tower
to the ecstatic cries of the crowd a cross is hoisted up in its place
astride horses columbus and the treasurer santangel are watching the scene
they push through an extraordinary scene
the city of granada has just been reclaimed from the moors after several years of siege
all around them spanish soldiers are herding bedraggled columns of the defeated moors bearing only a few possessions
ragged half starved men women and children
these people built granada
it is a great victory over the moors don colon and yet what a tragedy it is
the three horsemen pass a procession of grateful penitents who are crawling on their knees chanting psalms and flagellating themselves
at the head of the procession hooded priests carry a statue of the virgin mary swathed in silk and lace
the gates of the alhambra palace are in sight
is this a good time to meet her
it couldnt be better
victors cant say no
bells are pealing triumphantly
the noise is tumultuous
they ride towards the magnificent palace
fabulous moorish gardens ponds filled with golden carp exotic bird cages hang from lemon trees
the distant sounds of victory
santangel and columbus walk through the gardens escorted by halberdiers
soldiers pass by carrying coffers or piles of documents
as they approach the inner sanctum however there are fewer people
they stop by the lions fountain where several dignitaries are waiting patiently for an audience
santangel approaches to murmur a compliment
sanchez protests softly and looks over at columbus a half smile forming on his lips
then a duena appears and motions for columbus to follow
an ornate moorish door is pushed open by the duenas hand
we enter the throne room sculptured colonnades mosaics
at the far end windows open onto a view of granadas rooftops
against this dazzling light the delicate silhouette of queen isabel of spain
the light in her blonde hair creates a halo around her head as she turns
columbus falls to his knees
he approaches the window stopping close to her
isabel scrutinizes him quickly
i should not even be listening to you since my council said no
but santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity
and sanchez that you are not a fool
bold no more than the woman who said she would take granada from the moors
isabel smiles enjoying the lack of obsequiousness
the ocean is uncrossable
what did they say about granada before today
a beat that she was impregnable
isabel smiles again
i cannot ignore the verdict of my council
surely you can do anything you want
a direct challenge
she doesnt know what to make of this man
how little you know
this little hint of vulnerability subtly reverses their positions for a moment
now we sense columbus scrutinizing her
may i speak freely
with a smile you show no inclination to speak otherwise
i know what i see
i see someone who doesnt accept the world as it is
whos not afraid
i see a women who thinks
amused at his familiarity a woman
a slight pause
but youre the only queen i know
she bursts out laughing
then we are equal
since you are the only sailor i know
how old are you senor colon
thirty seven your majesty
once again taken off guard isabel flushes and turns away slightly to hide it
you will be informed of our decision
columbus bows and goes to leave
as the duena opens the door for him he turns back
actually i thought you were younger than me
and he goes out leaving her stunned
a chalk white road lined with trees
two liveried servants are walking down the road one carrying a large silver tray the other a smaller tray
they are overtaken by an administrator who hurries along the road with documents under his arm
the clerk enters an imposing stable block
in the paddock sanchez is training a magnificent young horse making it step sideways bending it to his will
the administrator watches him unable to interrupt
behind him the two servants can be seen bringing in the silver trays with covered dishes of food a decanter of wine
they begin to lay them out on a table
sanchez pours himself some wine tucks into his his food while the administrator clearly working himself up into a frenzy reads from a document
and he demands
he demands to be made a knight with the right to bear the golden spurs
he will receive the title of don cristobal colon which will be extended to his descendants for ever more
the administrator looks up
he is reading the contract that columbus has proposed
sanchez his mouth full gestures for him to continue
he will be named great admiral of the ocean sea
viceroy of the west indies
governor of all islands or lands discovered or as will be discovered with his help
the administrator looks up again
the highest titles of nobility your excellency
to an immigrant sheltered by monks
sanchez gestures for the document
wipes his mouth
continues reading calmly furthermore he will receive one eight of all wealth or monies precious gems pearls metals spices and other lucrative sources conquered within the boundaries of his admiralty
he smiles hands the document back
its very underdone
its monstrous excellency
no the pheasant
its almost raw
and he carries on eating
you worry too much carvajal
the man will have to lower his demands
believe me he will
close up on columbus
a womans hand quietly carefully opens a cover of a spy hole in the wall
two beautiful eyes peer through a grille into the next room
what they see sanchez and columbus together
columbus is visibly upset
calmly we have considered your demands very carefully senor colon
your expectations are
excessive in every way
columbus tightens his fists tries to remain calm
if i am right my requests are fair
sanchez holds up a document
we have prepared our own contract
he offers the document to columbus who takes it scans it quickly shakes his head
i have waited too long fought too hard
now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit
i will not be your servant
the eyes behind the screen the mouth forming a little smile
i remind you senor colon that you are in no position to bargain with me
im not bargaining
steely then you are too ambitious
columbus leans over the table faces him
and were you never ambitious excellency
or is ambition only a virtue among the nobles a fault for the rest of us
abrupt if you wont accept our proposal well simply find someone who will
if you can do that excellency ill become a monk
he turns strides towards the door
we hear a womans muffled laughter
as columbus goes out isabel appears through a secret door
isabel goes over to the window and looks out
you were right don sanchez
his demands could never be granted
never your majesty
she turns questioningly towards him
although one may always renegotiate a contract
especially signed by royal hands
sanchez joins isabel at the window
they see columbus striding out and away
quietly into a monk
with a smile yes
it would be a pity wouldnt it
turning to sanchez call him back
columbus pushing his way through crowds
he is expressionless and distracted
he looks around him stops walking
and then unexpectedly shouts
all heads turn as if he were totally insane
he walks on as if nothing happened
columbus is sitting at the kitchen table by himself with a glass of wine
there is a movement behind him
beatrix is standing at the foot of the stairs in a night shirt
columbus turns and looks at her almost sad
she said yes
moved thank god
but he seems to be unable to share her happiness
if i ever come back i swear i will
she crosses to him quickly placing her hand gently on his mouth
softly im not asking you to swear to anything
i dont want you to wait for me
smiling thats something you cant decide
columbus kisses her
strange unearthly music
a flickering light in a dark tunnel
fernando holding a candle in front of him walks slowly down the dark corridor
quietly opening a door he walks into columbus study
close on a huge illustrated map of western europe and asia
fernandos candle moves slowly across the atlantic ocean to the edge of the map
there the illustrators imagination has created monsters terrifying demons creatures half human half animal
sitting at his desk columbus is looking at the map
you cant go there
turning columbus finds his son beside him
fernando points at the monsters
he pulls the boy to him
there arent any monsters fernando
the only monsters are in here
he taps his own forehead watch
he takes a pen and draws a smile on one of the terrible monsters transforming it at once
fernando laughs immediately
i want to go with you
therell be a time
columbus nods his head do you swear on st
fernando pulls the chain with the st
christopher medal from under columbus shirt
do you swear on all the holy saints in heaven
yes i do
on all of them
and he hugs his son tightly
a luminous procession passes through a moorish stone gate down to the harbor
we see the faces of the sailors and their families columbus pinzon amongst them we sense the fervor and apprehension of the departure
the procession is lead by marchena and four young novices carrying the madonna
all hold long burning tapers saying the rosary
a sailor pushes through the crowd and kisses the madonnas feet
hundreds of candles flicker in the pre dawn light held by the families and friends of the sailors
the santa maria the pinta and the nina nestle against the quayside
dwarfed by the hulls a flotilla of smaller fishing craft returning from night fishing accidentally witness this event
marchena sits on a barrel and crosses himself
behind a curtain sits columbus
in nomine patris et filius et spiritus sancti
forgive me father
for i have sinned
marchena recognizes columbus voice
i am listening my son
father i have betrayed my family
i betrayed my men
and i betrayed you
what are you saying
the journey will be longer than i said
i am not sure
it could be twice the distance
may god forgive you
you must tell them
you must tell your men
if i tell them they wont follow me
you know that i am right father
you trust me
my son my son
he shakes his head your certitudes are sometimes frightening
pause christopher you must speak to them
and if you dont i will
you are bound by an oath father
a long silence
i believed in you
give me absolution
give me absolution father
devastated marchena reluctantly makes the sign of the cross
columbus walks over to where beatrix and fernando are waiting
he kisses and hugs fernando
ispo te absoluto
may god forgive you and have mercy on your soul christopher columbus
go in peace
the crowded quayside
columbus stands in front of be good to your mother fernando
do you promise
fernando nods tears in his eyes
then columbus embraces beatrix tightly
she whispers into his ear
speak to diego
but columbus and diego are unable to find words and instead they clumsily hug
someone taps columbus shoulder
he turns around to see santangel
wordlessly they hug
activity on the ships orders are being shouted ropes fore and aft are cast off splashing into the water
now the ships are slowly moving parallel to the quayside
the crowd starts walking abreast to the vessels
women holding up babies blowing kisses old parents crying
beatrix her sons and santangel are among them
columbus suddenly unties the chain around his neck and throws it at diego
diego catches it
opening his hand he looks at the medallion
then looks up at his father elated
the santa maria is now two meters from the quay
santangel is now opposite columbus
casually take care of my investment wherever youre going
ambiguous i have to tell you santangel
i dont know where on earth i am going
they both laugh
a fisherman standing in his shrimp boat lets his hand slide gently along the gigantic hull
he stares up at the sailors leaning on the rail
vaya con dios
go with god
they wave back
marchena walking towards the moorish gate
he finally turns sad and distraught
he sees the sea resembling a dormant monster holding its breath
a living being all powerful capable of unpredictable metamorphosis
music reflects the loneliness the anxiety of the crew the fear of the unknown
enormous whales moving slowly alongside surging majestically through the waves
sinking back disappearing their cries taking precedent over the music
a ships boy is throwing buckets of water on the deck
a sailor is busy clearing the ropes around the mast
a cook is blowing life into a brazier in preparation of the evening meal
ten men heaving on a heavy rope raising the top sail punctuating their efforts with a sailors chant
the crystalline north star as if seen through an instrument
columbus silhouette by an oil lamp standing at the prow
holding a quadrant he is aiming at the stars
some sailors are watching with curiosity
one of them is alonso a rough stocky basque
near columbus on a tressel various books and charts
he makes an entry in the log
then goes back to his quadrant
he senses mendez standing next to him
softly due west captain mendez
and may god be with us
god be with us admiral
mendez doesnt move continuing to observe columbus
what is it mendez
mendez is hesitant
he nervously clears his throat
its the men sir
they wonder how you know our position
weve lost sight from land days ago
still taking readings and what do you think mendez
well i surely know what a quadrant is
but ive never seen it used at night before
come over here
mendez hesitates then motions to columbus
the sailors are watching and some approach to hear the conversation
now find the north star
do you have it
the picture swims across the heavens until we see the north star
keep the plumb line vertical
the picture steadies
mendez nods and loses equilibrium
the plumb line swings
a mistake of one degree and well be off leagues
mendez tries again
what do you read
mendez turns to columbus
the twenty eighth parallel
and well follow it until we reach land
alonso does not seem convinced
how do you know land is on the twenty eighth parallel
a blazing sun
the ship is like a furnace its brass fittings too hot to touch the blistering heat making the air shimmer over the decks
desperate for shade sailors are sheltering under the sagging prow sail
the ships boy throws an empty bucket attached to a rope over the side and hauls it back up again brimming with water
as he turns we see his face disfigured by a hair lip
he drenches himself
from the shade alonso watches him
chicken ass face
the others laugh
the boy ashamed tries to ignore them
alonsos hand accidentally touches a brass fitting he reacts like he was burnt
he sucks his blistered fingers
i never seen heat like this
not even in las minas
the waters going putrid in the barrels
youll be drinking your own piss
for the glory of spain
and admiral colon
the ships boy glances round at them
what are you listening to chicken ass
ah leave him alone
hes doing no harm
with a face like that
to boy i dont want you looking at me
the boy turns away dropping the bucket back into the sea
hes the devils child
well all go crazy
the boy throws more water over the deck
a sailor takes his guitar and starts singing an improvised song
culo de galina es el hijo del demonio
chicken ass mouth is the devils child
born from the loins of a stinky old goat etc
they all laugh
the boy hearing this climbs to the crows nest like a monkey
we experience a sense of vertigo as we near the top of the main mast high above the rolling deck
the boy curls like a fetus in the swinging crows nest exhausted by the heat and scared
his eyes are turning white
he begins to piss himself
piss is dripping on the deck
the sailors do not seem to care
the cook takes a chicken from a cage
he breaks its neck and starts plucking it
the others continue their bitter conversation
we should have seen land
we left three weeks ago alonso
cant be that near
cant be that far i say
also i dont like the smell of the sea around here
smells like a cunt
the cook starts laughing
they turn to him
shaking his head of course it smells like it
thats why sailors take to the sea
they all laugh
alonso looks up at columbus standing on the poop deck scrutinizing the horizon waiting for the land to appear
and why does this one take to the sea
never says a word
mendez has sensed the danger of this lack of respect
he approaches them
to your post
they split in silence
the ship is plowing on pushed by a hot wind sailors sleep on deck
the ships boy is singing to himself
despite his hair lip he has a pure melancholy voice
columbus leaning over the prow rail staring ahead hears it carry over the darkness
close up on an hour glass nearly through its time
the ships boy throws an ampoulette over board
we follow the bulb attached to a rope passing the full length of the hull
as it reaches the poop deck another sailor shouts mark
a very primitive system of calculation for distance and speed
sitting near the ships boy columbus is making entries in a log book watching the hourglass
twenty nine sir
the hour glass runs out
columbus converts the mark into a daily average for distance and speed
six hundred and twenty nine
the ships boy cups his hands to his mouth to shout
pinzon his officers beside him looks across at the santa six hundred and twenty nine
an officer turns to pinzon to repeat the message
six hundred and twenty nine sir
pinzon does not seem too pleased
the officer examines his own calculations
captain i dont understand
i think i do
he goes back to his cabin
the three ships like dots on what seems to be a prairie of weed
the caravels are being towed by three rowing boats
close on the men rowing drenched with sweat
from the prow columbus is staring at the horizon
alonso pulling at his oars stares at columbus distant figure with hate and resentment
alonso suddenly ships his oars throwing the whole boat into disarray
mendez and alonso stare at each other
alonso defiantly stares at mendez
he then starts to beat a rhythm on the hull with his fist followed by the others
in the two other boats the men begin to follow suit beating a rhythm of protest on the hulls
mendez looks up to columbus in panic
on board pinzons ship an officer cups his hands to his mouth
captain pinzon requests permission to board
he looks furious
were way past leagues
calmly six days ago yes
you must be mad
we have to keep the hopes of these men alive
were on the verge of a mutiny colon
you think i dont know that
the land is there
i know it
you dont know anything
listen colon these are my ships right
so im telling you were turning back
and then what
half of the water has gone the rest is nearly putrid
you know that
apoplectic jesus maria
i should have never listened to you
you never did
you did all the talking for both of us remember
all we can do now is go forward
think about that
you tell that to them
let the men decide
columbus moves to the door
as an afterthought he takes his scarlet embroidered jacket from a hook
most of the men are now back on board
they go silent as columbus appears
he walks slowly over to them
all including alonso are surly threatening
who gave you the order to come on board
he looks up and down the line finishing on alonso
they stare at one another
god doesnt want us to cross the ocean
this voyage is cursed
some of the men murmur their agreement
we set sail for greed
god has abandoned us
the voyage is cursed
there are signs
alonso glances towards the ships boy with his hair lip
the boy lowers his eyes
columbus moves towards him pulls him forward stands him in front of alonso
this boy has the voice of an angel
what comes out of his mouth is blessed alonso
what comes out of your is evil
some of the men laugh at this statement
alonso is ill at ease
columbus pauses looks around at all the men
listen to me
every man is afraid who does something for the first time
but those who overcome their fears will find their rewards
i do not know if it is gods will that we cross this ocean but i am certain it is the devil who puts fears into our hearts
the men are listening
we sense a subtle change of mood
this jacket to the first man who sights land
i want a man up that mast day and night
columbus points at the ships boy
you start first
the ships boy rushes up the mast
as he climbs the mainsail starts to fill with wind
the deck begins to move under their feet
this movement under their feet seems to imperceptibly erase the fears and the angers
dont let this wind escape us
cries from the other ships as the sails snap taut filling with wind
men rush to their posts
pinzon stares at columbus shaking his head in disbelief
murmuring you lucky bastard
columbus walks away to his cabin then turning back to pinzon the more i sail the luckier i get
turning abruptly he enters his cabin
columbus is seated isolated at the prow wrapped in his cape struggling against the sleep
mendez approaches him with a bowl of soup
shall i take my turn
columbus shakes his head no and starts drinking from the bowl
columbus head nods lower and lower to his chest
he is asleep
we become aware of a sharp buzzing sound
it becomes louder as we move closer to columbus face
a mosquito lands on his temple
columbus reflexively slaps it
he wakes up and looks at his fingers a spot of blood a crushed mosquito
he stares at it for a moment
then slowly gets to his feet
in the luminous moonlight columbus is standing staring up at thousands of insects that wheel around the mast lantern
we hear the flutter of their wings and see the bats as they swoop and dive in a feeding frenzy
columbus turns stares into the darkness desperate to see the land that must be close
he kneels by mendez wrapped in a blanket
he touches his shoulder
mendez grimaces and opens one eye
an opaque dawn
columbus riveted staring forward as if to pierce the mist
the entire crew are clinging to the rail and standing on the shrouds
suddenly the ship boys voice cracking with emotion
columbus strains his eyes he still can not see anything
the entire crew stand and stare silent holding their breath
as the sun begins to rise the fog dissipates slowly exquisitely revealing a single palm so close it seems almost as though they could touch it
then a white slash of beach
near columbus a sailor falls to his knees and burst into tears
others laugh with joy
columbus watches this vision in disbelief his mouth open as if it were difficult for him to breathe
tears come to his eyes
he closes them
then opens them again
the land is there a green paradise
on screen the words october
guanahan island three row boats plunging through the surf towards the beach
columbus stands in the prow of the first boat
mendez is in the second
pinzon the third
they stare entranced at the lushness of the foliage and the blue clarity of the water
as the first boat beaches columbus leaps out and wades ashore
behind him the rest of the landing party splash through the sun dazzled water carrying the banner of castille and aragon
they stand on the beach almost in a dream
there is silence
the royal notary ludicrously overdressed now wet through stumbles over to columbus and holds out his contract and a pen
columbus scrawls his name
the men stare at him filled not only with new respect but with something amounting to awe
columbus turns to them tries to speak
by the grace of
tears have sprung to his eyes
he is so moved he cannot continue
coming to his rescue the ships boy starts to roll the drum
he then stops
pulling himself together in the name of their gracious majesties of castille and aragon and by all the powers vested in me i claim this island and name it san
the men cheer as the flags are rammed into the sand flapping in the wind
columbus starts to walk towards the jungle and in silence the rest follow
immediately they are met by an incredible wall of sound
the jungle is filled with noise
the impossibly loud cries of exotic birds the chattering of monkeys
the spaniards are overwhelmed
they move forward
rays of sunlight pierce through the high canopy of leaves like the roof of a magnificent cathedral
the sounds and smells intoxicate their senses
they are filled with wonder
then pinzon stops
he has seen something
another stops then a third staring ahead of them
whispering urgently arquebuses
several of them raise their weapons to their shoulders pointing them into the jungle
from columbus pov we slowly scan the face of the thick jungle ahead
for a moment we dont see anything and then with a shock we see the first indian
naked painted like an idol carrying a hunting lance
as if they had materialized from nowhere the rest of the hunting party with their bows and spears
they stare back at us
the spaniards nervously finger their weapons
columbus slowly lifts his hand into the air a clear signal not to fire
then removing his sword he drops it on the ground and starts to walk forward fixing his gaze upon the first indian he saw
columbus ignores him even though some of the indians have raised their weapons
he stops in the no mans land between them
the indians dont move but something excites them
the ships boy wearing columbus embroidered jacket and the drum has followed columbus and now stands close to him
he is the cause of their interest
columbus puts his arm around the boy and this gesture of affection seems to put the indians at their ease
they start talking and pointing
they come forward slowly start to tentatively touch the boys jacket
then now laughing they touch columbus pulling at his beard
columbus laughs too
sensing their innocence the rest of the men lower their weapons
some of them laugh
an apparition a beautiful young indian girl totally naked walks out of the jungle
she is pregnant and holds a child
we begin to hear indian music played on a flute
a large post is lifted from the ground by two spaniards pulling on ropes
the post is fixed into position and then we see that it is a large wooden cross
the indian villagers watch the ceremony with some interest and amusement
columbus looks over at the men and gestures at the we have come here in peace and we will behave with honor
they are not savages and neither will you be
treat these people as you would your own wives and your own children
neither are you free to take what you will for a seashell you give a bandana
you will respect their beliefs
pillage will be punished by the whip
rape by the sword
the smoke from fires
the indians have prepared food for the spaniards who are drinking and enjoying themselves in this strange world
columbus sits with mendez pinzon the indian chief elders of the village
other indians stand around smiling curious
the indians talk among themselves
the elders smoke primitive cigars and offer them with good humor to their guests
the spaniards cough and choke at first
in return they offer the indians wine
dogs roam around the campfires
the women openly suckle their babies
the men are entranced
pinzon draws out attention for the first time to a small gold ornament on the nose of one of the indians
he points to it indicates his interest in it
the indians says the word in his own language laughing
we see that some of the other indians also have small gold ornaments
pinzon repeats the indian word for gold
the indian removes the ornament from his nose gives it to pinzon who indicates that he wants to have it
the indian nods but points to pinzons dagger indicating that he wants it in return
pinzon shakes his head stops the indian from taking it
to pinzon give it to him
pinzon looks at him about to argue but columbus insists
pinzon takes out the dagger and offers it to the irritated by god
thats the worst trade of my life
his friends laugh
innocently the indian has taken it by the blade
he yelps looks down at the blood welling up
a moment of tension
then mendez laughs at his clumsiness and the elders laugh too
and the indian laughs
just outside this circle we see the first indian we saw squatting on his haunches watching
this is utapan
the first light outside the strange wonderful sounds of the jungle all around
columbus writes in his journal
i think we have returned to eden
surely this is how the world once was before the beginning of time
i believe no man will ever see this land again as we do for the first time
he looks up
utapan is squatting in the doorway of the hut
hes been there all night
columbus takes more ink on his quill and begins to sketch utapans face in the margin of his log book
he draws well
he gets up and walks over to utapan and shows him the drawing
its an electrifying moment
utapan is shocked and amazed
at first he is rather frightened of his own image
then he is happy and laughs
and columbus laughs with him and puts a hand on his shoulder in a gesture of friendship
utapan gets up and indicates that he too has something he wishes to offer
utapan expertly scampering through the jungle
columbus follows him
utapan orders columbus to sit
utapan looks up at the tops of the trees
the sun is rising and filters through the foliage
as if the time had come utapan stands up and columbus does the same
a gap in the dense vegetation
something is glittering
a mass of gold
as they approach columbus discovers a large pool of fresh water
the morning sunlight has turned the water into liquid gold
the surface ripples with the breeze
it the stranger satisfied
isnt this what he came for
columbus plunges into the pool
as he emerges he fills his palms with liquid gold
wide shot a flotilla of canoes are going upstream
indians and spaniards are traveling together in the canoes
utapan leads the expedition in columbus craft
the ship boys cranium is shaved like utapans and we notice that some other crew members are beardless some even wearing tribal patterns
indian villagers confronting the spaniards utapan talks to an elder man watched by columbus mendez and pinzon
utapan repeats several times the word for gold showing some artifacts
the old indian shakes his head no indicating another distant place
the old man nods points into the distance chatters away to utapan
say not here
what is it
standing at the prow of the ship his long dark hair floating in the wind utapan rejoicing at the speed
led by utapan the spaniards hack their way through thick jungle
its hard work
the men sweat
this is inhospitable terrain
even the noises of the jungle seem somehow more sinister
resting place alonso is seated under a tree
he takes off his boot and grabs his foot examining the blisters on his toes
as he puts his foot back into the boot he jumps screaming in pain
alonso yelps grasping his ankle
close on a snake sliding out of the empty boot
while his companions rush to him a sailor spots the snake and decapitates it with his sword
utapan glances at the dead snake
he then goes and kneels he sees the bite on alonsos ankle
alonso is quiet and silent
his eyes are looking around at his companions
utapan shakes his head
there is nothing he can do
alonso is now leaning back supported by one of his friends
he has grabbed the forearm of a sailor
his look is already far away
his companion shouts at utapan
alonso starts convulsing
his friends hold him desperate in their helplessness
others simply move away horrified
one of them cries
standing in the stream up to his thighs a spaniard a gold expert examines some stones
he then looks up at columbus and pinzon and just throws the stones back into the water without a word
the group of spaniards are resting exhausted by the humidity
some are drinking from the river others soak bandanas and tie them around their necks
one after another they stand up slowly they look discouraged tired and beaten
utapan and the spaniards are trekking in the hills
fully armed they are now suffering intensely from the heat and the vicious insect bites
columbus doggedly keeps up with utapan who tirelessly trots forward
finally columbus turns around and sees
he calls out to utapan
utapan stops obediently and rushes back to columbus with comical energy
on their way back they find one soldier sitting leaning against a tree
he has removed his helmet
his hair sticking to his forehead
as columbus and utapan walk back they find another sailor then another then the whole group gathered around pinzon
ashen he burns with fever
he attempts a smile
youll have to continue without me
columbus looks around him what he sees exhausted men and jungle as far as one can see
what would you say to a drop of jerez pinzon
and a nice slice of santa fe lamb
id sell my soul for it
to his officer help me up
ive got to piss gold
they all laugh as the officer helps pinzon to his feet
pinzon walks a few yards into the jungle starts to urinate
it is red
suddenly dizzy he reels and collapses
a line of spaniards and indians threading their way down a mountainside
pinzon is being carried on a makeshift stretcher
his eyes are closed his face thick with sweat
they enter a village to the surprise of the indians
utapan once again at the front as the ambassador
a indian shaman is forcing a milky fluid into pinzons mouth
columbus attempts a gesture to prevent him
but utapan stops him
columbus nods he obviously trusts utapan
in the half light figures wreathed in smoke columbus mendez and utapan watch the chief guarionex putting a spanish helmet on his head
the helmet is too big almost covering his eyes
the elders appraise the gift with solemn wonder
in return guarionex hands columbus a parcel made of leaves
columbus unwraps them
inside a gold grimacing mask
the first real piece of gold
columbus is unable to conceal his excitement at this first real evidence of the metal
he waits for the chief to speak but the chief only looks at him
on the ground we see other presents offered by the spaniards trinkets and necklaces
to columbus you come
you speak first
tell the chief we thank him
tell him his country is very beautiful
tell him we are leaving men here to build a fort
tell him we will return very soon
many of us
the chief guarionex asks a simple question
chief says how many
columbus doesnt seem to understand the question
for the first time he seems to be caught short
to bring the word of god
chief says he has a god
pursuing and also to bring medicine
interrupting he has medicine
pause tell him we admire his people
chief says he knows you like his
searches for the word women
and the chief gets up awards columbus with a smile and walks out of the hut the elders following leaving columbus alone
with a little smile thats a beginning
watched from the shore by the indians and by about forty of the spaniards who are staying behind the boats pull out towards the two remaining ships
pinzon is laid out in the bottom of the boat
columbus utapan and four other indians are in the same boat
thirty nine of my men volunteered to stay behind
god willing we will be back in less than a year
the boats continue to pull away the figures on the shore growing smaller
close on a golden mask
the lamp in the cabin swings violently back and forth creating strange shadows as if the mask was alive
columbus is writing with difficulty in his log book
several men are ill
we did not find signs of civilization
no cities no temples
nothing that resembles marco polos descriptions
my ships are not filled with the spices and the gold that spain was hoping for
but this land intoxicates the senses like the strongest of perfumes
and all i can think of is to return to these untamed lands
suddenly the cabin seems to lurch over
things fall from the table smashing on the floor
columbus nearly falls
we are in the middle of a violent storm of terrifying proportions
the thunder is deafening
light irradiates the darkness
we see the two caravels dwarfed by the massive seas
five men are struggling to lash down the tiller
the deck jumps and rolls
it rises five meters into the air then falls into space and hits the water with a terrible crack
waves sweep over the decks
we hear desperate cries for mercy from the terrified crew loud enough to be heard above the storm
columbus and mendez are crawling towards the mast along a lifeline
screaming to the sailors get below
all of you
the men start to scramble below decks
to mendez stay with me
the ship rolls again
columbus and mendez crawl towards the mast
another gigantic wave crashes over them tons of water falling like cement
they reach the mast
the wood groans
we may have to cut it
columbus grabs some rope
the ship rises into the air again crashes down the deck disappearing beneath them for a moment
screaming out ill stay here to decide if we cut it
with mendezs help columbus is tied to the mast one rope under his arms the other around his waist
mendez hands him a horn
screaming now go
mendez seems to hesitate
columbus screams at him again
i said below deck mendez
mendez crawls away
another huge wave washes over columbus
he emerges almost suffocated
the storm rages its eerie light making it seem at times like bright daylight
but as the lightning flashes columbus begins to count one
theres an enormous thunderclap on four it indicates how close they are to the eye of the storm
the ship keels over again dropping down and down seeming never to rise
columbus lifts his head to the heavens screams out damn you
as if in answer another flash of lightning that illuminates the sky and the sea
columbus starts counting again
another terrible clap of thunder on five columbus starts laughing knowing the storm is moving on
then in the strange light something seems to move through the air towards him it looks like some kind of projectile a craft with a trail of vapor
columbus stares up at it
we start to hear the te deum majestic and heavenly
columbus looks up at the vast roof to see an incense burner swinging gliding swiftly across the ceiling trailing a think vapor of incense
a magnificent te deum is being sung in honor of columbus achievements and return
the whole cathedral is packed with nobles and dignitaries in their gorgeous robes
beatrix fernando and diego are staring in fascination at columbus triumph somewhat separated by the grandeur of this occasion
columbus passes by walking proudly down the long central alley beside king ferdinand and queen isabel and other grandees
he turns to his family keeping his eyes on beatrix until she is out of his vision
the procession is followed by utapan and other indians in tribal regalia
as they move through the crowds all eyes are upon in a simple room a priest finishes giving the last rites and a sheet is pulled over the head of
his wife and children weep at the bedside
a stool passes from hands to hands
it is placed at the queen and kings side
columbus sits on it a supreme privilege
to one side sit arojaz and sanchez
arojaz leans over to whisper to him
it wont be easy to get rid of your prophet now don sanchez
whispering on the contrary your eminence
it seems to me the man is preparing his own cross
close on the face of a young spanish nobleman adrian de moxica
hesitantly he brings a lighted cigar to his lips then pauses
we discover other people around the magnificent candle lit table
noble men and noble women
columbus takes the cigar from moxica
the rest watch him with rapt curiosity
columbus inhales deeply then to their astonishment blows out the smoke through his nose
you must not inhale but simply allow the palate to enjoy the flavor of the tobacco
he hands the cigar back to moxica
with a casual air moxica himself inhales deeply almost chokes to death
he gulps down a glass of wine
much to the amusement of the others
deeply embarrassed and you say this is an indian vice
i dont see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin
the indians have no such word don moxica
do they have such thoughts
they come and go as naked as the day god created them
isabel blushes slightly
they dont see sin in their nakedness
they live according to nature in a never ending summer
the islands are covered with trees filled with blossoms and fruits
interrupting forgive me don colon
but what about gold
columbus nods turns and whispers something to a servant standing just behind his chair
the servant goes to open the door and in comes utapan dressed as a tribesman carrying a casket
the women around the table fan themselves furiously at the sight
utapan puts the casket down in front of the queen and steps back
these are gifts for your majesty
isabel opens the casket revealing the gleam of gold inside
she takes out some of the little golden ornaments
a bracelet and then the mask
she holds it somehow moved by its crude beauty
isabel raises the mask to her face looking across at the image is somehow powerful enough to reduce even the aristocrats to silence
she speaks from behind the mask
we are more than gratified
the guests laugh obsequiously
columbus bows a little looks up and meets the eyes of sanchez who is staring at him coldly
a sword master advances towards us with determination his sword flashing
he is fighting an adversary we do not see and comments his movements
we discover the sword master is fencing with columbus
a dozen duellists are practicing in the magnificent rotunda surrounded with a two tiered colonnade
out of breath columbus stops the exercise and removes his protective canvas padding
he bows at his teacher who salutes him in return
columbus walks to a tressel laden with food and beverages
sanchez in a fencing outfit and boots is having a glass of wine
upon seeing columbus approaching he hands him a glass
you defend yourself admirably
for a commoner
sanchez laughs and raises his glass
to your second expedition
a short somewhat ugly man with some kind of imposing energy approach them
don colon don alonso de bobadilla
a man who knows our laws
i understand that you will soon be appointing governors for the islands
is it not so
forgive me don bobadilla those positions have already been taken
disappointed may i ask by whom
bartolome and giacomo colon
sanchez looks at him in surprise
i trust they are men of quality
bobadilla glances at sanchez
but we do have a lack of notaries
you should contact my administration
amused don bobadilla is already a judge my dear don cristobal
we are also in need of judges
except there are no thieves
a grin disfigures the face of bobadilla
to sanchez i see i was mistaken
don colon has no need for my services
and he walks off
sanchez fills his mouth with a slice of ham
amused you seem to have a special talent for making friends
do i have so many already
seriously to rise so high in so short a time is a dangerous occupation
kindly a little hypocrisy goes a long way
columbus with two men the oldest around thirty is a strong looking man
the youngest no more than twenty five is thin and fit
there is obvious tension in the room
these are bartolome and giacomo colon columbus brothers
bartolome is angry and giacomo thoughtful
you might have given us a choice
bartolome is stronger more capable than i will ever be
i need both of you
what are you afraid of
we are living what we always dreamt of
you know i never shared those dreams with you
are you saying you refuse to help
columbus looks at them with such pained surprise
amused you bastard
you always had your own way
let me show you something
he opens the door to a terrace
the large gallery courtyard is crowded with people applicants for the voyage
as columbus appears they all press forward calling out his name trying to get his attention touching his sleeves as if he were a saint
they crowd around columbus and his brothers
columbus nods murmurs vaguely here and there
well see to it
fighting their way through the bothers press their way reaching the other side of the gallery
we get glimpses of the incredible activity down below
administrators militaries merchants are busy around tressels covered with documents plans maps
preparing the second expedition
columbus puts his arms around them
indicating the applicants now you tell me
who can i trust
almost amused were brothers
we must be a house
in this country one cant exist alone
i need you
both of you
he walks then to the balustrade
the cries from the courtyard down below subside
some of the applicants begin to look up aware of his presence
where is the admiral
has anyone seen the admiral
he is here
what is it
he leans over the balcony
in the middle of the overcrowded courtyard the soldier who was shouting is brandishing a document
the horses have arrived
i saw them
who did we hire today
another assistant raises his eyes
thirty blacksmiths twenty eight halberdiers twenty carpenters a hundred farmers twenty miners
and doctor chanca the royal surgeon
the royal surgeon
then we can count on royal health
the whole courtyard bursts out laughing
utapan is lying in his hammock
fernando turns him over
utapan falls to the ground
columbus walks beside beatrix
looking at his son hes growing up
beatrix smiles nods
they walk on
beatrix i want to ask you something
with a smile you dont usually ask
after a pause i can arrange for the queen to take fernando and diego into her service
beatrix stops in her tracks looks at him
it is a great honor
we could not hope for anything better
beatrix nods but bites her lip and looks back at for once i wish you werent right
columbus puts his arm around her waist pulling her closer they move away
fernando is now swinging expertly in the hammock
utapan is pushing him gently
he slowly straightens up to watch columbus and beatrix disappear somehow sensing there is a dilemma
fernando noticing utapans reaction turns to his parents
the arbor is empty
fernando becomes pensive
we become aware of the rustling of the jungle
fifteen hundred men spread along the beach looking towards the jungle
columbus stands beside his brothers and mendez and utapan
moxica astride a magnificent black horse prances back and forth across the sand
all are waiting
a signal cannon is fired from one of the ships
birds scatter into the air from the jungle but then silence complete and ominous
columbus stares into the jungle
no one to greet them no welcoming party from the men they left behind
columbus glances at mendez
mendez looks at him but cant answer
moxica suddenly spurs on his horse and guides it into the trees
the order is given for the rest to follow fanning out as they do so weapons at the ready
the camp has been burned to ashes
a strange sight arrows are stuck vertically into the ground each with a moldering tuft of human hair attached to the flight
in silence the soldiers pick their way through the devastation
the ground is littered with coconuts
kicking one over with his shoe a soldier discovers that his coconut is actually a human skull
the gaping mouth has been filled to the brim with gold
but of the living there is no sign
is this your new world don colon
columbus looks around in dismay
a young nobleman hernando de guevara takes out his sword
these animals should be shown what savagery can be
other spaniards join in repeating this last word
three heads for every life taken
no mercy before god
lets find them
there will be no revenge
everyone looks at columbus
we lost cousins friends
we will wash this in blood
if you want to keep your head on your shoulders youll do as i say
they are all listening
moxica i lost friends too
thirty nine brave men who trusted me
he walks among them
you want a war
we are a thousand
they outnumber us by ten
who will you kill
we dont need to know
we came here to stay
not to start a crusade
in this forest there is enough danger to sweep us away in days
so we will be brave and swallow our grief
and in the name of those who died we will accomplish what we came for
moxica mounted on his magnificent black stallion canters to the edge of the deserted village and enters the village
utapan is terrorized by the absence of anything living
all we can hear is the breathing of the horse
the animal an impressive mass of muscle prances nervously
utapan calls out in dialect
slowly they begin to appear one after the other materializing from the jungle
shy and scared
they stare at this centaur the horse and the horseman seem to be one a god
to impress them even more moxica makes the beast move sideways and backwards rearing its front hoofs pawing the air
the indians retreat in terror except for one who stands his ground brandishing his lance
utapan encourages the young warrior to approach the centaur
he places his hand onto the shoulder of the animal
the muscles shudder
the indian jumps back comically accompanied by the rest of the tribe
without warning moxica climbs down from the saddle
more indians step back in fear and absolute astonishment
now more have ventured from the jungle
the bravest of them approach moxica daring to touch him and the horse retreating then touching until they fill the compound
at this moment columbus and his soldiers appear all around them pointing their muskets and their crossbows
a moment of tension
columbus walks forward towards the chief guarionex we meet before
ask the chief what happened to my men
the chief answers
another tribe made war on them
came by sea
took them away
god have mercy on their souls
the monkey is lying
the spaniards shifting eager for blood
we should kill them don colon
utapan looks anxiously at columbus
youll do it my way
to utapan tell the chief we will not harm his people even though we have the power to do it
the chief listens in silence
we will work with his people
we want peace
ask the chief if he understands
ask him if he will help
it is raining hard
columbus is floundering in the mud supervising a mixed work force of spanish and indians
they are attempting to raise the huge wheel of a watermill
despite columbus shouts of encouragement its clear the wheel is far too heavy and the mud too deep
close by on horseback moxica watches the scene
columbus plastered with wet mud clambers out of the pit and approaches him
don moxica we need your horse
moxica looks down at the sodden dirty figure
we cant raise the wheel without it
my horse doesnt work
columbus wipes some mud from his eyes
don moxica we all have to work
you did not hear me don colon
not my horse
he starts to turn away columbus grabs hold of the reins
forgive me don moxica
but it was your horse i was talking about
moxica stares down at an equally determined columbus
then in front of everyone moxica has to dismount and suffer the disgrace of it
thank you don moxica
columbus leads the horse away
harnessed the horse pulls with columbus and the men
the wheel is raised into position
water thundering into the new canal
the huge wheel begins to turn
the men cheer and congratulate each other
moxica looks at his mud splattered and foaming horse his eyes full of hatred
a wide high shot of the new city dominated by a huge wooden cross no more than a muddy main street bordered by a hundred bamboo and stone shanties with
candles burning in the doorways
a main square with the governors mansion and the foundations of a church
in the twilight columbus and the other workers returning dirty and tired
moxica and guevara sit out on the veranda watching the men return
moxica raises his glass in an ironic salute
to the governor of the mosquitoes
we see the smoke and flames from a fire
four or five indians are squatting on the earth nearby cooking for them talking quietly in their own language
moxica calls out something in their language and a naked young indian girl comes out of the house bringing more wine
guevara stares at her lasciviously
moxica letting his hand casually brush against her flank smiles at him
do you want her
he turns the girl round so that guevara can admire her properly
moxica lets the girl go with a peremptory order and she disappears back inside
guevara suddenly stands up unsteadily and sweeping his arm round in a broad gesture says ironically to the new world my friend
to the new world
in an already spanish colonel dining room columbus is having dinner with his brothers bartolome and giacomo served by an indian woman nima
giacomo eats with gusto
as nima pours the wine nimas a good cook
shes more than that
seeing giacomos sudden blush and discomfort as nima smiles at him the other brothers laugh
to cover his embarrassment giacomo returns to the topic of the food
what is it
ill tell you later
as he sees bartolome stifling a laugh giacomo pauses
id like to know what im eating
columbus eats a mouthful glances at bartolome
a look of horror crosses giacomos face he wretches slightly puts down his fork and gulps down some wine
the brothers laugh again
what wrong with it
the indians eat it
im not an indian
he wishes he were back in the seminary
priests always eat well
tasting his wine grimacing and they have very good cellars
nothing grows here
everything rots in the ground
the wheat and vines wither before we can harvest them
weve got to learn to live like the indians
pause eat your iguana
reluctantly this time giacomo goes back to his dinner
they are drinking and smoking cigars
from the balcony they can see the dark mass of the jungle stretching away
giacomo is already dozing in his chair
bartolome sees it and elbows columbus
they both smile at their younger brothers exhaustion
then columbus gets up and leans on the balustrade looking down at the city the jungle beyond
how much gold have we found
not enough to justify a single shipment
perhaps it doesnt exist anywhere but in my imagination
then lets hope not
pause what will happen if we cant find enough gold
they begin to hear the sound of a flute a melancholy sound
columbus looks out over the jungle and kills a mosquito by slapping his arm
jokingly then im governor of the mosquitoes
an indian is playing the flute
in the gloomy interior of the long hut in the most primitive conditions dozens of spaniards lie sick
on a segregated part of the room are the indians several coughing
they are attended by a doctor doctor chanca brother buyl and other novices
a novice attends to an indian gently lifting his head helping him to drink there is so little they can do
brother buyl looks down at the body of a spaniard covered in open sores
the novice joins him
what kind of disease is this
i dont know
it seems almost as if we have exchanged diseases with the indians
they die of our most common cold and we of their plague
god forgive us
a man covered with sores is screaming thrashing in his agony
he is held down his voice muffled
isabel turns away shocked
she is in a ward full of patients attended by a doctor sanchez and other members of her court
the patients are emaciated their faces and bodies covered with virulent sores
nuns move between the beds
it seems to be caused by intimacy with the native women your majesty
will he survive
no your majesty
they go mad then they die
there is nothing we can do
isabel looks around at sanchez appalled
every ship returns with a cargo of sick and dying
but with no gold
the new world proves expensive your majesty
we werent expecting immediate profits were we
we must have faith
we must give time for time
sanchez bows in acknowledgement
but isabel despite her words looks distressed
excavations carved into a hillside
it is a blisteringly hot day
at the foot of the hill giacomo sits at a table beneath an awning with moxica and several clerks
one hundred fifty indians standing in line at the table
in turn they hand over a small quantity of gold
the clerk weighs it on a scale and notes down each contribution
moxica impatiently gestures the indians to move faster with a thonged crop
an indian approaches the table
he is nervous
he doesnt produce anything
the indian shakes his head gesticulates starts to speak rapidly
he says he has not found any
again the indian pleads and gesticulates
moxica hits him across the face with the thonged crop
the indian tries to run away but is held by a spanish soldier
bring him here
the frightened indian is brought back to the table
one of the clerks slips away
tell him to put his hands on the table
at the other end of the site the clerk sprinting to giacomo who was talking to a foremaster
don giacomo youd better come at once
moxica turns looks back at the long line of indians still passively waiting
tell them i want them to watch this
the terrified translator speaks to the indians
giacomo and the clerk running to the scene
to the clerk i cant
with a single swift action moxica draws his sword and cuts off the indians hands
all hell breaks loose
the indians flee disappearing into the jungle
giacomo arrives at this moment
he stares at the dismembered hands in horror
sitting behind a table with his brothers and flanked by his council columbus presides
moxica stands before them
in one act of brutality you have created chaos
tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us
all that because of your criminal savagery
casually savagery is what monkeys understand
youll be held in detention deprived of your privileges and possessions
until you are returned to spain where you will be judged
have you anything to say
with exquisite insolence you will regret this
he strolls to the guards at the back of the room
everything is quiet on the mine site
on the terrace two soldiers are drinking in turn and cracking jokes
one of them leans against the wooden wall
he laughs as he hears repeated banging behind him
a third soldier is fucking an indian woman against the wall
on the terrace his two companions laugh and encourage his efforts
a whooshing sound
an arrow embeds itself in the chest of the soldier who was leaning against the wall
he is nailed to the wood behind him
the other soldier stares at him transfixed until an arrow pierces his throat
he collapses unable to cry out for help
four indians in full warrior outfit their faces painted burst into the room
still busy with the woman his eyes facing the wall the soldier believes the intruders to be his friends
without stopping you animals
cant you wait
discovering the four terrifying figures staring at her the indian woman starts screaming and pushes back the soldier
he turns around jumps off the woman and starts to scramble to the front door trying to put on his trousers
the four indians catch him and force him to lay on the ground
the man struggles his eyes rolling in terror
two indians force his mouth open
a third one kneels and starts stuffing it with gold dust
the soldier chokes and suffocates
the woman still stands half naked against the wall terrified
an indian takes his knife from his leggings slowly
she starts sobbing and imploring in her language
the indian slowly walks to her and plants the knife in the lower part of her belly
pairs of bloody red legs hanging still high in the air
pulling back we discover a dozen spaniards have been crucified on the scaffolding of the excavations
some hands and noses have been removed
utapan is standing uncomfortable among the spaniards
a soldier removes a huge iron nail from a wrist
one of the crucified bodies is gently laid on the ground
he is still alive not for long
columbus and bartolome are silent with rage
aggressively moxica is right
our ways dont work
bartolome turns to utapan
aggressively can you find them
utapan looks distraught this is the first time he is being asked to do something against his own people
he looks up at columbus for help in confusion
you have to find them utapan
look what they did
you did the same to your god
columbus is caught short
we have to stop this war
he walks and takes an arrow
he examines it
do you know them
utapan nods uncomfortable
around a campfire two dozen indians are squatting
they are arguing over a musket and some woolen hats they stole from the mine
the indians raise their heads
all around them crossbows and muskets are pointed at them
two indians try to run away
they are shot
this sound triggers the spaniards response
they start shooting at random
utapan is horrified
columbus stands up shouting
moxica and a group of rebels guevara among them silently approach the entrance of the mansion
a guard is stabbed and falls on his knees with a cry
moxica tears columbus plans of the city from the wall
on the table the model of the future city
watched by the other aristocrats moxica sets fire to the parchment he has rolled up
he blows the flames from the torch onto the model
fire races up and down the streets of the miniature as if burning the city of isabel
a mad gleam in moxicas eyes
the half burnt remains of the mansion
columbus stands in the square looking up at it
behind him his soldiers his brothers and about thirty captured indians
giacomo walks slowly across the square
columbus looks at him in disbelief
through cracked lips moxica
columbus leads his party of soldiers through the jungle looking for the mutineers
they reach the river scan the far bank
his men start to enter the river led by a others follow wading across their weapons held above their heads
a crossbow arrow pierces the halberdier
without a cry he falls forward into the water and is carried away by the current
two more men are hit
one cries out thrashes around in the water an arrow protruding from his side
the river stained with blood
still no sign of the enemy
columbus men nevertheless start to return fire from the bank creating a shield
others continue to wade across the river
a mutineer is shot down from the branches of a tree
the first men come ashore
an exchange of arrows
columbus is now wading across
the man next to him is killed and carried away by the current
now on the far shore the enemy have shown themselves
there is hand to hand fighting with swords and other weapons
moxica kills one of columbus men but his own are outnumbered and outmatched
already some are beginning to surrender
in the midst of the fighting columbus sword drawn pulls himself out of the river a mutineer lunges at him
columbus kills him with a thrust of his sword and walks forward into the jungle
he spots moxica at the foot of a cliff
moxica starts scrambling up the rocks behind him with columbus following
the climb through the dense undergrowth is so exhausting they are now almost climbing in slow motion
moxica bursts out of the undergrowth
he is at the edge of emptiness swept by a violent offshore wind
he turns frantically to see columbus coming up behind him
knowing he is lost moxica regains his natural arrogance
he steps backwards towards the edge
you know what they will say in spain about my death dont you
he takes another step backwards as columbus moves towards him
you are nothing
you bastards will never inherit your titles
we are everything
we are immortal
he smiles and steps back into space
his body falls bounces off the rocks below crashes into the water
columbus stares down as his body is swept away
close on columbus expressionless face
a mutineer his face is white he is crying and trembling
his arms are tied behind his back
he is held fast a rope is put around his neck
columbus sitting not far away beside his brothers gives a signal
drums begin to beat
brother buyl looks on impassive
a grimace suddenly transform the young mans face
he is being garroted his throat crushed with a rope
the young mans feet dance frenziedly
we hear the choking
the drums cease
brother buyl crosses himself and murmurs a prayer deeply distraught
giacomo has covered his eyes
a wider view shows the bodies of three other aristocrats from the rebellion attached to chairs affixed to a pole their heads straight the rope still tight around their necks
justice has been done
the members of the council rise in silence columbus stands up
close on several large wooden cages
inside we see the indians that columbus captured
they are packed together
they stare out with vacant eyes
soldiers guard them
a ship against the pier
buyl at his side columbus stares at the indians
i wish to go back with them don colon
i have no desire to remain in this godless place
you may do as you please brother buyl though your departure will not help me to make it more godly
brother buyl looks at him almost with astonishment
you treat christians equally with heathen savages
you execute members of the nobility
and what do you offer in return
quietly a new world brother buyl
nobody wants one
and he walks away
against the livid horizon three black waterspouts join the sky to the sea
a gust of wind disturbs the roof of the jungle
the wind grows stronger
doors bang inside the building
a melancholy sound
columbus sits on the balcony with his brothers
they are silent
after a few moments columbus begins to speak quietly almost as if he were speaking to himself
perhaps hope only exists in the journey
when it begins everything is still possible every expectation every dream
the brothers do not answer
this is not how i imagined it to be
utapan begins to shave his head
the sky is dark and threatening the wind even stronger
we find columbus where we left him but now alone
he has sat here all night
shutters bang violently
he looks up and sees a few yards from him the naked figure of an indian his face and body painted staring at him
columbus realizes who it is
utapan is still and silent
a strange and mysterious figure now
utapan wont you speak to me
you used to know how to speak to me
sadly in his own language you never learned how to speak my language
utapan is gone
the wind is whipping the trees now stronger and stronger
groups of indians look up at the sky
then above the sound of the wind they hear another noise
like a collective murmur almost in one voice the indians repeat over and over
the wrath of god with a loud thunderclap the storm suddenly breaks
in a few seconds it has risen to violent proportions and the landscape is drenched in torrential rain
the wind doubles its strength
and all hell breaks loose
the hurricane is full force
trees are being ripped up by their roots
rivers of mud are washed down from the hills carrying everything away in their paths houses carts equipment horses
the mine workings flooded with mud
columbus bartolome and mendez struggle through the teeth of the hurricane towards the dam
timbers creak and strain
columbus bartolome mendez and a dozen other men are trying to save the dam
suddenly frighteningly the dam begins to crash
screaming let it go
let it go
the men scramble away as the dam wall buckles and burst open
water floods over them a roaring torrent
from the bank mendez bartolome and columbus survey the ruins of their dreams
columbus is stretched out on his bed in his devastated bedroom
a column of ants is threading its way across the floor each ant carrying a piece of leaf
rain falls over a table covered with documents
columbus face is covered in dried mud
he promised us gold but has failed to find it
he subjects the natives to violence provocation and injustice
he sent them to spain against the express wishes of your majesty
we are back to the first scene
in the vast opulent glittering room isabel listens impassively to the voice of sanchez
also present other grandees representatives of the church and state
but there is worse
he ordered the execution of five members of the nobility
is this true brother buyl
yes your majesty
it is all true
i saw it with my own eyes
isabel seems to struggle inwardly with her emotions
sanchez waits expressionless but on the point of victory
then what do you suggest don sanchez
he must be replaced
and who would you think of for such a task
we see a buckled shoe as it rises it slips into a stirrup
the horse is mounted
the shoe digs into its flank
the sound of hoofbeats
i am thinking of a man
a devotee to your majesties
a man extremely motivated
five men on horseback dressed in fashionable clothes canter down what used to be the main street of isabel
through some has been rebuilt the effects of the hurricane are still visible
people look at them curiously
we see them stop near the governors mansion
the men dismount and walk into the palace
one of the men in black clothes removes his hat and steps forward
we recognize him as alonso de bobadilla the man columbus humiliated at the rotunda
columbus is sitting at his desk studying plans with giacomo
some other members of the council are with them
don alonso de bobadilla
bobadilla turns gestures to one of the other men who comes forward and gives him a roll of parchment bearing the royal seal
my letters of appointment
appointment to what
viceroy of the west indies
then i am free to search for the mainland
bobadilla smiles wickedly happy to give columbus a low blow
didnt you learn
the mainland was discovered
by another italian
i forgot his name
amerigo vespucci excellency
how far from here
i am not a seaman
but i heard it is no more than a week at sea
i hope you are not too disappointed
how could i be
the mainland has been found
exactly as i said it would
i am afraid this is not the worst news
all is dark
we can just make out columbus face as he lies on the hard bed
he is sweating heavily his beard is filthy and matted like his hair
he looks feverish
a key turns in the lock
the jailer lets in two fashionably dressed young men
columbus blinking in the light turns his head to stare at them
his eyes are reddened with infection at the corners
the young men come forward into the light
unable to believe it columbus slowly sits up
he laughs overcome with joy
diego how did this happen
santangel is going to see the queen
we are going to get you out of here
i have to go back
diego and fernando look at one another then back at columbus incredulously seeing his filthy clothes his eyes rimmed with dried mucus
theres a new excitement in columbus voice
he walks over to the table
the candlelight illuminates maps charts drawings figures
i have to explore the mainland
this time with me
columbus laughs and diego looks at them both in astonishment
in your present state it is madness father
fernando glances at diego
nobody is forcing you to come with us
diego is hurt
i cant go anyway
shes very beautiful
the queen has very good taste
diego is getting married
diego seems saddened by his brothers attitude
once again diego feels like the outsider
columbus hugs him
i am happy for you diego
like lucifer and gabriel santangel and sanchez sit on either side of isabel
granted his faults
yes a hundred times
but the man is still remarkable
isabel looks at him then at sanchez moved but clearly undecided
santangel presses his point
all he asks is a chance to explore this
it does not belong to him
quietly in a way it does don sanchez
to the queen i beg your majesty to receive him
to hear him
he will make no more demands
he has changed
he is penitent
he is suing us for breach of contract
she starts to laugh
santangel tries to stop himself laughing
columbus is shown into the room
isabel is waiting for him
he drops to his knees before her
this time she walks towards him clearly moved by his white hair and other signs of physical deterioration
her hand hovers over his head as if it means to console him
her hand is dying to comfort
but instead she offers her hand for him to kiss
columbus gets slowly to his feet but his eyes as they meet hers are as clear as before
isabel smiles with relief to see it
he looks back at her
now i do look older than you
she smiles then again tries to restrain it and keeps her dignity
we have decided to allow you to undertake another voyage to the new world
columbus starts to interrupt she stops him with a gesture
but without your brothers
nor are you to return to santo domingo or any of the other colonies
you may explore the continent
there is one thing id like to understand
why do you want to go back after all this
your majesty some men are content to read about things
i must see them with my own eyes
i cannot be other than i am
she almost bursts out laughing only pauses turns slightly then goes out
sanchez is standing alone in the next room he has obviously been listening
he looks at her
i know i should not tolerate his impertinence
because he is not afraid of me
sanchez in another direction along a corridor towards his office
as he reaches a corner with a wide window a hand seizes him
all i have to do is call the guards
sanchez looks at him and doesnt call
columbus lets go of him
i am not afraid of you
you are nothing but a dreamer
look out of that window
surprised sanchez nevertheless turns looks out
what do you see
all of them created by people like me
sanchez turns round again to face him
no matter how long you live sanchez theres something that will never change between us
i did it
columbus turns abruptly and walks away vanishing down the echoing corridor
columbus dismounts in the courtyard
everything seems deserted
theres no one about no sign of life
columbus walks slowly through the great rooms
there is nothing left no furniture rugs pictures
he turns sees beatrix standing in a doorway looking back at him
they are both moved
youre so beautiful
i cant believe no other man has ever taken you away from me
but i didnt let them
they dont dare to touch
beatrix looks round the empty room
they took everything
looking at her not everything
do you think i care
im a free man again
riches dont make a man rich they only make him busier
theres a pause
god how much ive missed you
and they throw themselves into each others arms
all that has been left is a simple table and one chair
they are having supper by candlelight in the vast empty room though the candles throw a warm sensuous glow on the figs and hams and wine
and on their faces as beatrix sits on his lap
what more can a man expect when he tries to sue the crown
with only a little embarrassment beatrix gets off columbus knee
santangel comes forward and columbus embraces him like an old friend
beatrix goes to the kitchen
i owe you everything santangel
but as you see i cant repay you
on the contrary
it is i who owe you everything
through you i have been an adventurer an explorer
its true i shall never see the new world
but its here
he points to his head and here
pointing to his heart columbus smiles
beatrix returns with a plate and glass for santangel
what you are colon is a sailor a discoverer a man of imagination
not a politician
you werent meant to govern you cannot be all things to all men
he takes the wine beatrix offers and raises his glass
i wish you could have compromised
it would have made your life easier
but as least we havent been bored have we
they all laugh and drink
night on the open sea the moon shines on the waves and we hear the creaking of ropes and timbers the loneliness and mystery of the night passage
southwest captain mendez
steady as she goes
columbus walks over to fernando who is leaning against the rail
he is smoking a cigar
as the smoke blows over fernandos face fernando wretches
its clear hes feeling seasick trying to control it
columbus leans against the rail next to him staring out at the darkness
then looks at his son again
fernando wont give in to the sickness but columbus knows hed feel better if he did
how are you feeling fernando
in a strangled voice not bad
columbus nods meditatively puffs out some smoke
fernando winces gags slightly
almost casually you know what i always used to do
fernando shakes his head
swallow a piece of pork fat on a string
it always worked
at the thought of the pork fat fernando jerks his head over the side and vomits copiously
columbus smiles pats him on the back
as it plows through heavy seas
columbus a coat wrapped around him is sitting on a chair topside directing operations despite an obvious fever
suddenly a cry from the mast head tierra
sailors and fernando rush to the side of the ship peering through the spray
fernando wipes his eyes and then he sees it there in the distance a speck of land
fernando and his father stand together watching the low cloud formation sitting on the horizon
fernando looks excited
discreetly columbus watches his son enjoying his happiness
a most wonderful and surreal image
a heavy mist lies over the forest
we move above it slowly
a figure emerges from the mist
at first only a silhouette then slowly a golden figure
an indian covered in gold
gold artifacts golden paste on his body
the golden figure turns and points into an unknown distance
from the indian treehouse columbus fernando mendez and several indians are gazing west over a necklace of magnificent lakes
the indians point and talk gently
fernando has never seen anything so fresh so beautiful
a magnificent sunset
a fire is burning food cooking
columbus looks over his maps trying to figure out where they are
we see the outline of the continent of asia
an old indian squats beside him silent also looking at the map
then slowly and very deliberately he takes a piece of charcoal from the fire and begins to draw on the map
ignoring the asian continent he sketches the panamanian coastline an isthmus
mendez and fernando gather round
columbus watches the old indian with initial puzzlement then growing excitement
whats he doing
hes drawing an isthmus
hes saying were on an isthmus
we cant be
fernando is still confused
the old indian continues to sketch talking quietly all the time
an indian translator listens
tell me what hes saying
he says water on the other side
ask him if he means a lake
a big lake
the translator asks
the old indian shakes his head laughs points to the west way beyond the other lakes emphatically
says those are lakes
water on other side big as wide as here
above and below much land
stunned an ocean
hes says its an ocean
i dont understand
columbus is too stunned for a moment to explain
the indians laugh
then columbus takes the charcoal and begins to draw on the map for his son
here is europe
and over here the continent of asia
but theres something in between
fernando stares west then back at his father
columbus looks very feverish his face bathed with sweat
there must be a passage to that other ocean
columbus feverish lies on the bunk
he shivers violently
fernando anxiously watches over him bathes his eyes
suddenly the translator enters
a little reluctantly fernando lets him go to his father
the indian crouches over the bed takes out a handful of leaves from a pouch
he chews the leaves himself for a moment until they form a sticky pulp then opens columbus mouth and puts the pulp inside encouraging columbus to chew with the motions
of his hands
columbus chews quickly falling asleep
we see things from columbus hallucination
we are plunging through layers of clouds the speed accelerating giving us a sickening sensation of falling to land closer and closer
columbus wakes up with a jolt
everything is silent
columbus walks outside
columbus fever has subsided
he raises his head and stares at the mainland passing in the night
the roof of the jungle the bay beyond the caravel at anchor
two canoes going upstream deeper and deeper into the jungle
smoke rises lazily above the trees
the boats reaching the bank
the first huts of a village
the soldiers spread out into the empty village
fernando columbus and mendez preceded by two armed soldiers enter one of the huts
the remains of a meal is still warm in bowls on the matted floor
a famished soldier dips his hand in one of the bowls and devours its contents some kind of stew
stepping back accidentally fernando bumps into a large earthen jar behind him
it rolls and crashes revealing the remains of meat marinating in liquid
there is something disturbing about the appearance of the content
oh my god
the remains of human beings
approaching what is
he stares at the remains stunned
the soldier stops chewing
he drops the half empty bowl he was still holding
he runs at the back door rams his fingers deep in the back of his throat and vomits
oh virgen maria
oh madre de dios
oh virgin mary
oh mother of god
but as he vomits and cries he notices a headless human trunk spread open like a sheep carcass
disturbed flies rise in clouds
jesus maria y todos los santos
jesus mary and all the saints
columbus and the spaniards meet in the center of the village
all have made the same horrific discovery
the spaniards back out of the village crossbows pointed at the invisible enemy hidden in the jungle
they are running through the dense forest for the river bank
the cannibals materialize among the trees running alongside
bounding skipping frightening figures their brutal faces painted in black
they release arrows at the running soldiers
a soldier stops kneels to the ground fires his crossbow and kills one of the cannibals
but he is pierced by a spear
two cannibals drag him and cut his throat to finish him
and cannibals moving in hand to hand combat
a cannibal comes sprinting at fernando brandishing his lance
columbus jumps on the man and plants a knife in his abdomen
blinded in sweat he stabs the cannibal who collapses
frenzied columbus stabs over and over again
he stops and looks at his forearm soaked in blood
shocked by his own fury he raises his hand and stares at it
a giant black butterfly alights gently on his bloody fingers columbus staring fascinated at its palpitating wings
fernando screaming at his father drags him to his feet
the spaniards columbus mendez fernando
all running hard to the boat
arrows whistle around them as they leap into the canoes nearly capsizing them launching them into the current
some cannibals still follow them along the riverbank
but the canoes are faster and soon they are left behind
endless seascape the caravel plowing
fernando is crouched on the poop deck wrapped in a blanket
he seems in a state of shock he is pale and shaking
as columbus goes and sits near his son he hands him a flask of alcohol
kindly take it
as columbus insists brandishing the flask fernando notices that his hands are shaking too
his fathers forehead is dripping with sweat
fernando drinks a gulp and grimaces
he drinks again and hands the flask back to his father who does the same
fernando notices dried blood on his fathers fingers
columbus immediately hides his hand and stands
i have to see mendez
then with sudden anger
your brother was right
i should have never taken you with me
ill never forgive myself
he walks a few steps lurches and has to lean against the rail
he raises his hand to his eyes grimacing in pain as if they were burning
fernando scrambles to his feet and rushes to him
columbus eyes are already fixed somewhere fever is eating him up
will you ever forgive me
fernando turns around for help
columbus is lying on his couch
fernando is bathing his eyes sweeping off the pus that continuously forms in them
columbus is drenched in sweat
fernando is writing under his fathers dictation
i came to your highness with honest purpose and sincere zeal
i did not undertake these voyages for honor or wealth that is certain
after years of service to the crown i do not have a roof to put over my head
your majesty allowed me to explore the continent believed to be asia
i now believe that it is an new land of unknown proportions and wealth
life has more imagination than we carry in our dreams
the duena sitting beside isabel quietly continues to read columbus letter aloud
i should be judged as a seaman who by divine will discovered a new world and thereby placed it under the sovereignty of your majesties
i humbly beseech your majesties that if it pleases god to remove me hence you will help the name of columbus to be remembered with honor
weep for me whoever has charity truth and justice
she stops reading
isabel turns her face away
an ivory sculptured hand the end of the back scratcher belonging to arojaz indicates a line across a large globe the route between europe and america
the sunset route to the new continent is now well established
we see a large amphitheater filled with people attending a lecture of nova geographica the new geography
arojaz stands in front of the assembly
facing him enthroned is king ferdinand surrounded by courtiers including sanchez
we slowly move across the arena passing attentive faces
west by south west for leagues to santo domingo
from there west north west leaving san juan to the north reaching the island of hispanola on the northern cape of san raphael
then onto the mainland at the cape called gracias a dios
we continue to rise up the tiers of seats
spain by your majestys grace has confirmed for all humanity the existence of an unknown continent
on a highest tier we stop on the face of christopher columbus listening impassively
this continent was first discovered by a sailor commissioned by your majesty
close on columbus eyes
around the king on horseback surrounded by the knights a crowd is kept back by soldiers
arojaz is mounting his horse
sanchez is waiting for him
columbus stands among the students at the back of the arojaz rides next to sanchez
arojaz suddenly spots columbus in the crowd as they move off
i thought he was dead
they pass close enough to touch columbus
but he does not see them
you can see for yourself
what a tragedy
what a waste of a life
let me tell you something arojaz
if your name or mine is ever remembered it will only be because of his
arojaz looks at sanchez in surprise then cranes his neck round and looks back at columbus now a face in antonio de marchena a very old man now is taking
a siesta next to his grapes
he is sitting in a simple armchair a rosary wrapped around his fingers
the presence of someone wakes him
after a moment he recognizes columbus and smiles
both men are very moved
i suppose were both old men now
youll always be older than me father
columbus sits down
bees drone lazily in the sunlight
have you ever forgiven me
marchena nods his head
i forgave you a long time ago
you see i was proud of you
you were like a willful child
you wouldnt accept what others told you
you had to find things out for yourself hurting yourself and others in the process
marchena looks at his plants sighs contentedly
do you remember when you said that people talk about the world but never leave their gardens
more than ever i wonder what it is we do achieve by leaving our gardens
the world changes and yet it seems the same
we find new worlds but fill them with the same people
he pauses looks across at columbus smiles again gently
marchena tiring leans back in his chair and looks up towards the sun
i have to disagree
i knew you would
new worlds create new people
so you are a new man
i dont know
i have the impression that i didnt change that much
i still cant accept the world as it is
marchena starts laughing
god bless you and those like you
they both laugh
fernando is sitting in front of his father examining documents and letters
columbus has wrapped a shawl around his legs
he looks even older now with his mass of pure white hair
beatrix comes out with a tray carrying grapes and a decanter of water
she places it on a small table near columbus and touches his shoulder
as she is ready to return inside the house he holds her back
cant you stay with us a little
i am busy inside
she looks at him smiling intrigued
what is it now
i cant keep my eyes off you
i would like to catch up with all the moments i didnt spend with you
fernando looks up at them above his letters amused and slightly embarrassed
columbus looks at him with a fake air of reproach
what are you listening to
i am not listening father
but i cant help hearing
fernando opens a letter and reads it quickly
he is at the court with santangel
he says they hope to get your privileges restored
and maybe the house
columbus smiles and nods all this seems to be of very little importance to him now
but how is he
and dona maria
fernando continues to read
fine it seems
diego is thinking of starting a pearl trade in santo domingo
he says he received many letters for you
some of your men mostly
he opens one of them glances at it
this one is from mendez
columbus eyes brighten with joy
what does he say
he asks when he can come to visit you
he left his address
smiling he never had one
except aboard my ships
fernando laughs then suddenly serious
i want you to tell me everything you remember father
from the beginning
i wouldnt know where to start
tell me the first thing that comes to your mind
columbus sighs and leans back on his chair
his eyes are fixed somewhere searching
then almost in a murmur
we see the page
a drop of ink falls from the quill onto the page and the words
fernando is waiting
a moving image as seen from the rolling deck of a ship
we see a majestic forest resting on a slash of white sand and deep blue sea
the lone silhouette of an indian emerges from the dense foliage
he runs down the beach towards the surf
he stops and seems to be staring at us
