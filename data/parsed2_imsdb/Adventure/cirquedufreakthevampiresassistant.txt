written by brian helgeland close on a spectacular example of peucetia viridans
descending through mid air on a silken thread
neon green with black leopard spots on its legs
a green lynx spider
as we follow it down the threaded opening of a glass jar appears from the bottom of frame
just before the spider continues inside the jar it stops suspended
somethings not right
it waves a leg tentatively through the air
just a little lower
widen to reveal a middle school toilet stall
standing on the lid of the closed toilet holding the glass jar up over his head is darren shan
darren is and a well liked kid
the spider just hangs there
ill take good care of you
all the bugs you can eat
the door bangs open and steve leonard enters
unlike darren steves not so well liked
in fact he can be trouble
maybe thats why theyre friends
steve walks along the stall scoots low so he can see any feet in front of the bowls
did you fall in
steve looks to the last stall sees the jar being held up
intercut from in and outside of the stall
youre gonna scare him away
man were getting killed out there
its three to nothing
darren is all concentration as the spider drops a little
your problem steve not mine
steve gets a waggish idea
stepping to the sink pressing his forefinger over the spigot he turns the faucet
water shoots out in a stream which steve directs into and then over the stall door
reacting the spider zips up its thread is lost in the darkened ceiling
the stall door opens
dripping water darren stares at steve who flashes a wicked grin
kids eat lunch off in their groups
on the field darren has a soccer ball practically glued to his foot
he dribbles through defenders shoots scores
steve pumps a fist goal
three to one
the other team regroups starts back upfield with the ball
darren steals it
a few strides and whump
darren catches the goalie too far out
the ball lofts just over the backpedaling goalies head bounces into the goal
three to two
angry at himself the goalie kicks the ball away
it veers off toward the street
steve takes it as a personal insult
what does that prove
the goalie blanches as steve moves at him
kids are nervous about steve
he likes to fight
darren gets between them
go get the ball
lunchs almost over
thats why he kicked it
to kill time
well i still got time to kick your face
steve decides heads after it
the goalie gulps in relief
darren watches after steve
he does have a vicious streak
steve tracks down the ball which has rolled into the street
from seemingly out of nowhere
a gleaming black lincoln continental
its tires sucking at the asphalt as it rolls
the windows blacked out
it speeds up reaching the ball
the ball bursts
the car screeches to a stop idles ominously
suddenly steve doesnt seem so tough
he looks nervously back to darren
but as a wind picks up the lincoln suddenly tears off
a sheet of paper is kicked up by one of the car tires
the wind sends it sailing
it drifts down until
steve notices snatches it out of the air
darren steps up beside him watches the lincoln disappear down the street
look at this
the paper is a flyer
a startling violent layout
beneath a snarling wolfs head ciroue du freak human oddities and other living curiosities
admission is at the discretion of the proprietor
human oddities and other living curiosities
does that mean not human
darren shrugs takes the flyer
a freak show
ever been to one
just this school
darren turns the flyer over
there are tire tracks on the back
they hear the sound of distant tire squeals but the lincoln is long out of view
just an empty street now
probing the confines of its glass prison
a boa constrictor by any other name
its a prison within a prison because were inside
the teacher mr
dalton moves ponderously around the room
his voice like a metronome
as you can see reptiles and amphibians are not one in the same
dalton continues we see various pairs of students their computer screens showing text or pictures of various frogs alligators and lizards
darren and steve sit together staring at a komodo dragon
dalton passes by steve switches screen views
hes done a websearch of cirque du freak
there are a dozen or so entries
he picks one history of the side show
under s theres an older much more victorian pamphlet for the cirque du freak
a more ornate version of the same wolf head
the same notice from the proprietor
steve spreads the flyer out to compare
must be a different one
steve scrolls down through pictures
sword swallower and glass eater ohio gray
frog boy avery childs
human skeleton j
egyptian soothsayer larten crepsley
crepsleys gaze is startling
like he can see through the screen even from
steve looks like hes just seen a ghost
suddenly he hits print
as a printer against the wall clicks to life steve looks back at darren
i gotta show you something
picture perfect two stories dormers trellises
year old annie rides up on her bike bookbag over her shoulder
without stopping she hops off dumps it on the lawn by two other bikes
a few steps and shes through the door
moody for the daytime
only the light from the half closed blinds streaking the floor where darren and steve are huddled over several clippings and pictures that steve has spread out
they all deal with vampires in some form or another
steve pulls another stack from his backpack spreads them out as well
i dont get it
ive been studying them
darren looks at him a beat
youre failing half your classes at school but youre studying vampires
they been around s of years
they even fight wars
okay sometimes when humans fight
they fight at the same time
and no one knows it
like at the battle of stalingrad they fought at the same time the russians and germans were fighting
darren just looks at him wonders if hes serious
some people know about it
there have even been books written
he pulls a frayed old yellow hardcover from his bag
thats your proof
steves really trying to convince him now
its everywhere if you look
on the internet in blogs newspapers weird places
but you can find it
the room starts to tighten a notch around them
i chatted online with one of them
we become aware of
someone watching darren and steve through the half open doorway
it moves in starts coming up from behind
what was his name
mad now steve opens the book flips pages finds an old th century painting
he slaps down the science lab internet print out of larten crepsley
its the same guy
here he is in
maybe hell be there tonight
would that make you believe
as darren looks them over the pov looms up behind them
suddenly darren spins
and roars at whats behind them his sister annie
she screams in response
steve jumps a mile
howd you know
saw your shadow on the floor
gotta try harder knucklehead
steve snaps his book shut shoves it in his backpack
im gonna get a soda
get me one too
steve gets up stomps out of the room
steve opens the refrigerator looks to see whats in there
at the same time darrens mother arrives home
coming in through the kitchen door she sees the refrigerator door open two sneakered feet behind it
i know you want to fight global warming darren but thats not the way to do it
steve leans back to show his face
oh hi steve
i thought you were darren
i wish i was
you guys got everything in here
she sets her purse down on the counter
hows your mother
shes been working a lot lately
a little frown of concern crosses darrens mom
something about steve
he brings out a bottle of soda
glasses are up there
darrens mom exits as steve pulls down two glasses starts to pour soda
as he waits for the foam to settle he sees
a quick look around it doesnt take him long to decide
steve steps over opens the purse
a quick rifling finds a wallet in s
he peels off three bills shoves them in his pocket
a cell phone starts going off in the purse
fumbling frantic steve stuffs the rest of the money back in the wallet the wallet back in the purse closes the purse darrens mom is back in
shes hurrying to get to her celiphone so
it takes her a second to realize somethings up
not listening to her call she watches steve grab the two glasses and hurry out leaving the soda bottle on the counter and guilt in the air
as she looks over at her purse
steve comes up off the stairs
he sets the glasses on a hall table continues into
darrens looking through steves vampire memorabilia
steve reaches past starts packing it up
i gotta go
see ya tonight
he zips the bag slings it over his shoulder
cirque du freak
i got no money right now
dont sweat it
i got money
meet me ten to midnight
the zeiterion theater
that place is supposed to be haunted
steve rolls his eyes starts out
what am i going to tell my parents
tell them youre sleeping over
we can meet early walk over together
i dont know man
d its cirque du freak
you wanna hear about it monday
or see it tonight
steve lets his point sink in then goes
darren and annie and his mom and dad eat dinner
annie chatters away
and thats why we need a dog
she waits for an answer
mom and dad exchange a look
well have to think about it
how do you guys decide whos going to say no when you look at each other
whoevers eyes are the widest
and i didnt say no
as she tries to think through a new approach
im gonna sleep over steves tonight
emphatic no hesitation no
because i said so darren
i shouldnt even have to ask stuff like this
the answer is no
and im not sure i want you hanging around with steve anymore
ive known him since i was five years old
people change and i dont like the way steves changing
but thats not fair
stop arguing with her darren
furious at his treatment darren gets up stomps out
as annie wonders if she should ask whats up
the moonlight glinting off darrens spider terrarium
darren under the covers gets out of bed
going to his door he listens
then he crosses to the window
pulling out the screen he starts to climb out
darren out his second floor bedroom window starts to climb down via the trellis
a section of the trellis breaks under his feet
darren almost falls catches hold
he pulls himself over starts down again
part of a dilapidated mostly abandoned downtown
darren and steve hurry around a corner
i came here after your house
there was a van there guy selling tickets
holds up tickets rest is history
they cross toward the ornate albeit crumbling facade of the zeiterion theater
deserted except for a few candles burning on the sidewalk by a door
the wind moans
you know why they closed it right
years ago a kid fell out of the balcony and died
steve catches himself getting spooked
he shoves darren
the walls scribbled on
most of all its dark
darren and steve head toward a glow coming from
they move toward a light at the end
darren pauses at a darkened staircase
he points it out to steve
where he fell
may i help you
they wheel around react to the sight behind them
gaunt but oozing an elegant toughness
were here to see the show
he takes an ominous step forward then holds out a hand
steve hands it over
tall pockets it looks to darren
do you have your ticket
darren starts to hand it over hesitates
the guy knew his name
tall reaches takes it
were about to begin
tall turns on his heel and strides off
as they follow he knew my name
maybe he heard me say it
tall turns a corner only steps ahead of them
when they turn it mr
tall is gone
ahead a threadbare velvet curtain
a low murmur on the other side
the boys exchange a last look then push through into
mouldings removed cherubs gouged from the walls of a once proud theater
rows of seats are missing as well
those that remain are filled
the crowd seems nervous watching the empty stage expectantly
yearning for something special
no sign of mr
darren and steve stand at the top of the aisle
the only kids here
somewhere off stage a trumpet sounds and with it a stage light goes out
steve nudges darren points out two empty seats halfway down
as they move for them a second trumpet sounds and a second stage light goes out
and so on
by the time darren and steve take their seats the theater has gone black
a final flourish from the trumpets and all is silent
then a dull green light glows across the stage
before it was empty now there is a cage set on wheels in the center
theres the scraping of chain
a low guttural sound
a white spot shines down leaves the front half of the cage in light the back half in shadow
a figure moves in there
the audience lean forward hoping to see when theres a roar
several people scream as the figure crashes to the front of the cage
a wolfman for lack of a better term its body covered in thick matted hair
it roars again shakes the bars
its half canine teeth yellow its eyes red
a chain hangs attached to an iron collar around its neck
half the audience believe its real
the other half are amazed at how real this performer seems
as they buzz mr
tall steps out on stage
wearing red leather gloves and hat
ladies and gentlemen
welcome to the cirque du freak
we are an ancient circus
we have toured for five hundred years
darren and steve exchange a look at this information
bringing the remarkable and grotesque to generations
our freaks are not people in masks
they are not harmless misfits
what you see tonight is real
each performer unique
to prove this the wolfman lunges reaches a claw through the bars to swipe just centimeters short of mr
tall whos non reaction shows he knows exactly where hes standing
a ripple goes through the crowd as they become aware of truska
dressed for the moulin rouge
crossing the stage in a languid catwalk
several men in the audience begin to cough and shift in their seats
even the wolfman takes notice
beauty and the beast
truska approaches the cage makes soothing motions her upper body swaying
the wolfman lulls to a trance
two stage hands midgets apparently hidden by blue robes step out and start to push the cage off stage
truska steps toward the audience moving in the same languorous rhythm
and then she begins to grow a beard
hairs creeping from above her lip curling from her chin
some in the audience recoil
darren and steve trade grins
this is great
from either wing of the stage come twin contortionists sive sersa
they walk on their hands their legs pulled back with their ankles cinched behind there necks
as truska exits sive and sersa meet in the middle
like hindu wrestlers they take turns climbing up and down each other look like one person with two fronts
they twist like pretzels getting huge laughs when they pretend to be stuck
as it goes on rhamus twobellies pads out to watch
the floorboards creak under his feet
he must weigh pounds
after a moment he turns walks toward the audience
the light leaves the contortionists and focuses on rhamus
my name is rhamus twobellies
and i do have two
he trips stumbles toward the edge of the stage
people in the front row jump back to keep from being crushed
rhamus stops short laughs at them
he was pretending
hes practically doubled over resting his hands on his haunches
more blue robed midgets roll out a cart covered with food and lots of other stuff
rhamus grabs a glass bottle of soda
instead of opening it he bites off the glass top chews it and swallows
soon hes eating food almost as fast as he can grab it
disgusting but great fun at the same time
next he holds up a couple of nuts and bolts
then swallows them whole
he swings his belly around
you can hear the sound of metal shifting inside
the crowd recoils as he starts to regurgitate spitting out bolts nails bottle caps a jackknife
they clatter on stage
finally a metal link appears between his teeth
he pinches hold of it and pulls
a chain starts out of his mouth up from his belly
six feet in all
with a shrug he starts off stage dragging it behind him
darren steve break into applause
so does the audience
as rhamus chain slides out of sight a snake slides in
an enormous boa constrictor
it slithers out to the center of the stage its tongue flicking in and out
a spotlight flicks down from above
the snake stops raises itself several feet off the ground as it looks up seemingly transfixed by the light
but in reality
the end of a thick rope drops down
and moving headfirst
down the rope is a boy
very thin his blonde hair tinged with green
this is evra von
he moves smoothly twists over backwards to set his feet down on the stage
evra wears a sort of cloak which he suddenly spins out of
the audience gasps
wearing only shorts evras body sparkles
hes covered in gold blue and green scales
he moves a vaguely webbed hand through the air charming the snake which raises itself higher still
he slowly slides forward till he and the boa are nearly eye to eye
then evra leans forward and kisses the snake on the nose
hes as old as us
evra starts to make a hissing sound
in response the snake begins corkscrewing around him like the stripes on a barber shop pole
finally it slithers around his neck pulls back to look him in the eye
evra bends at the knees lays down and starts to roll
like he was wrapped in a snake carpet he disappears stage left
more applause from the audience
then the stage goes dark except for a small focused spot at the center
everyone waits but nothing happens until
appearing literally out of nowhere one instant theres nothing under the spot and the next instant there is motionless looking past the crowd
the only difference from his pictures is hes a bit older and a scar runs down his left cheek
it stretches his mouth up on that side
cant believe their eyes
steve pulls the print out from his pocket compares
the crowd mumble nervously
and just as suddenly hes back
on the edge of the stage lit by the footlights
this time he holds a draped birdcage
its not true
that all tarantulas are poisonous
though some can kill a man
with one bite
crepsley whisks off the covering
in the cage a tarantula the size of a large mans hand
so big you can make out individual eyes
as deadly looking as it is beautiful
crepsley makes the introduction
pray that she never learns yours
two of the blue robed little people lead a goat onto the stage
a ripple of worry runs through the crowd
crepsley starts over
the goat bleats
the little people hold it
crepsley flicks open the cage door with his finger
the spider sets its front legs on the bars pulls itself through
a few gasps from the audience
the goat bucks
madam octa bares her fangs poised to leap on her prey
several audience members cry out that this should stop
crepsley looks out with mock theatrical surprise
shall it be life
chuckling to himself he looks to the goat tenders
they release the goat which bee lines its way off the stage
crepsley faces the audience
i wonder if you would be as shocked to see the same fate for me
madam octa moves climbing the outside of the cage taking a cautious step onto the hand holding the cage then starting up crepsleys arm
he stands dead still
have a million questions but right now the performance has their full edge of their seat attention
madam octa has nearly reached crepsleys left shoulder
though we have been together such a long time she is no pet
i think she would quite enjoy killing me
crepsley calmly raises his free hand
it holds a shiny tin whistle
madam octa has reaches his shoulder
for her bite there is no cure
madam octa bares her fangs even longer now
her malevolence about to be directed at her master
crepsley carefully puts the whistle to his mouth and starts to play as simple as it is evocative
madam octa hesitates
then she moves around his throat starts to climb his face using his scar as her guide
she gets to the top of his head stands in his shock of hair
she sways shes dancing
then she leaps lands on the end of the whistle
crepsley keeps playing as madam octa attaches a web drops down about inches off the end
she starts to swing
crepsley takes the whistle from his mouth and twirls it around
octa does a few s and the thread breaks
she sails up high over crepsleys head
he cranes back to watch as down she comes legs splayed
she lands flat on his face
the whistle is in his hand
crepsley looks out at the audience
looking out between her hairy legs his eyes are wide with horror
without warning the spotlight on him goes out
as the stage is plunged into darkness we hear crepsley scream
a horrible horrible sound
the audience wait but nothing happens
some of them rise from their seats peer into the gloom
its too dark
the sound of something being dragged
a light comes up stage left as mr
tall steps out
thank you ladies and gentlemen
that is the end of our show
what happened to him
dont you know
what happens to us all can happen to any of us
that said theres a crack of thunder and an explosion seemingly at mr
hes nowhere to be seen
the houselights come up
the stage is empty
some in the audience start to clap
others are a bit dismayed
darren and steve sit there as people start for the exits
lets get outta here
no you go
steve starts down toward the stage
whatre you doing
steve reaches the stage looks around
the audience is mostly exited no one from the cirque is in sight
as steve starts up onto the stage darren grabs his shoulder
steve wheels shoves darren who stumbles back into a seat
this is my destiny
dont ruin it
steve looks dangerous as he looms
darren raises his hands in surrender
steve eases off but hes still intense
that car today
it was a sign
sending me here
i was told thered be a sign
too friggin weird
told by who
the guy in the chat room
the internet guy
ill tell you later
if i can
steve scrambles onto the stage and disappears into the back
darren stands whispers into the dark
darren climbs up starts after his friend
darren moves back into the gloom
deserted the junk casts sinister shadows
then a sound at his feet
darren stops short
sees that hes almost walked into an open stage door in the floor
the sound is someone moving below
darren decides starts down steep rickety steps
he moves past a dilapidated stage elevator
as he heads further into the dark
coming down the creaky stairs
turning a corner is startled by what turns out to be a costume mannequin
but beyond a long box set on two sawhorses
empty its lid propped up by it
the dust is tracked with footsteps
a mini fridge hums in a corner
steve steps over sees an extension cord which runs up the wall disappears into a hole punched in the ceiling
stops short as a light suddenly cuts through the gloom to his left
darren steps over low behind a credenza
hes opened the door to the fridge
the little bulb inside pushes through the gloom lighting the area up
reacts as madam octa tries to jump on his face
the bars of her cage stop her
it rests on the credenza he crouches behind
the whistle is there too
darren looks over as
reaches in the fridge takes out a glass jar that looks to be filled with blood
steve raises it swirls it around inside
are you looking for me
steve whirls drops the bottle smash
standing behind him dead still crepsley
rooted to the spot
crespley sniffs the air the spilled blood to be exact
i i know who you are
tell me boy
who am i
youre a vampire
too broad a definition
do you introduce yourself as a human
who i am is larten crepsley
moving slightly to get a clearer view
crepsley suddenly disappears reappears much closer
steve jumps twists around
who sent you and what do they want
crepsley takes a moment to decide if he believes him
then what do you want
i want to join you
i dont understand
i want you to make me a vampire
not what crepsley or darren expected
steve stands there trying to look resolved
crepsley is surprised intrigued
is it because you want to live forever
because we dont
i dont care about living forever
but you do seem to live a long time
a long time alone
do you want to live alone
i already do
are you an orphan
my fathers gone my mother doesnt care about me
youre friendless also
i have a friend but he doesnt understand
hes got too much to know what its like to be alone
as darren reacts to this
when youre alone you feel weak
but i know there must be something strong about it too
i want to feel the power of being alone
i want to be a vampire
the power of being alone will never be greater than the weakness of it
i dont care
crepsleys actually impressed but after a moment he waves a dismissive hand
it makes no matter
we do not blood children
steve pulls a jackknife from his pocket flips open the inch blade
crepsley laughs out loud
do you intend to use that on me
and we feel it more than see it but steve cuts into his own palm
he holds it up moist and red in crepsleys face
make me a vampire
do not tempt me
cant believe what hes watching
he sees crepsley suddenly get scent of something
something to do with steves blood
not quite a clear view as crepsley grabs steves wrist dabs a finger into his palm and then tastes it
crepsley shoves steve down to the ground and immediately begins spitting onto the floor
like it was poison
you have bad blood
what do you mean
i can taste the menace in your blood
you can never be a vampire
steve scrambles to his feet
thats a lie
you take that back
crepsley draws himself full his voice deadly
suddenly cowed steve just stands there blinking
steve runs disappears into the gloom
after a moment we can hear him scurrying up the stairs
then hes gone
frozen to his spot watches as crepsley seemingly ill holds his head and spits again onto the floor
then he steps over and kicks the fridge door closed
and in the blink of an eye hes gone
darren is alone
he starts out then stops
that beautiful spider
and darren takes madam octas cage and the whistle and makes a run for it
just like that
darren hurries home cage in hand
looking over his shoulder
so far so good
he nearly trips over an untied shoelace
he sets down the cage to tie it
madam octa lunges across her cage at a worm on the sidewalk
you want that
darren picks up the worm lowers it between the bars
a beat and then madam octa snatches it away from him
im your friend
youre so beautiful i stopped thinking
the wind rustles
darren grabs the cage continues
the house dark
holding the cage with one hand darren starts climbing the side of the house using the other
he avoids the broken section but as he reaches the window his dad is standing there looking out
from his angle darrens dad cant see the cage in his sons hand
darren hooks it over the end piece of part of the trellis and climbs in
leaving the cage hanging behind
darren stands across from his dad
a freak show
are you kidding me
it was down at the old zeiterion theater
look dad im sorry
its just i couldnt resist
i you told me the other day you were broke
you were looking for a job to do around the house this weekend
whered you get money for the show
steve had money
darrens dads suspicion is confirmed
we werent going to tell you but we think steve stole money from your moms purse yesterday
he wouldnt do that
moms pretty sure about it
man what is this
you dont want me hanging around with him
now you say you think he stole money
do you know for sure
steves had some bad times lately
im trying to be a good friend
being a good friend and sneaking out are two different things
i have to sneak out
you treat me like a kid
a moment as darrens raised voice rings out of the room
then act like an adult if thats how you want to be treated
this world is crossed by fences darren interrupts
hes heard it a million times
i know i know
and you gotta decide which side you stand on
and you cant sit on it either
his dad doesnt enjoy hearing his words thrown back at him
he starts for the door looks back before exiting
a freak show
what do they do put people in cages for everyone to laugh at
darren feels bad like a kid
he looks down at the floor
it wasnt like that
darrens dad goes closing the door
he goes to the window pulls up the cage
he scans a look outside
except for his dad the coast is clear
darren sets the cage on a shelf shuts the door
darrens mom making omelettes
darrens dad helping dicing up some ham
annie sits at the table awaiting the results
is he in a lot of trouble
nothing a few years in prison wont take care of
i dont see what the big deal is
did you talk to steves mom yet
she said she couldnt comment because she didnt make it home last night herself
where was she
go tell darren its breakfast
seen through the bars of her cage
darrens just snapped her photo with his digital camera
as the door bursts open and annie enters
darren scrambles to block the cage from view
annie you gotta learn to knock
mom said to come eat
as annie tries to look darren stays in front of her
annie sighs heads out
darren puts the cage in the closet
darren arrives sits as everyone pretends not to notice
his mom slides his omelette off the pan into his plate
annie watches everyones every move
darren eats a bite
mom this is the best omelette i ever had
his dad cant help but smile
mom is pleased but knows shes being manipulated
as annie stifles a laugh darren shoots her a look
a knock at the kitchen door
annie gets up opens the door to reveal steve
from his angle he can only sees annie
hey midget wheres the idiot
annie motions steve in
he stops short when he see everyone else
he recovers does his best eddie haskell
its nice to see ya
as steve gets several less than welcoming looks
darren and steve enter his bedroom
what was that
everyone acting like they dont know me
did i walk in on something
darren closes the door
gets to the point
what happened last night
i hung out in the theater for awhile but no one was around
the lie hangs in the air a moment
sorry about the way i acted
im sorry i pushed you
theres you know no bad blood or anything like that
i said dont worry
you said bad blood
i never heard you say something like that before
what are you the word police
steve gives him a look
a weird tension in the air
darren glances at the bandage on steves palm changes the topic
wanna see that new game i got
darren steps over starts his computer up
while waiting steve sees the digital camera on the dresser picks it up
i gotta get one of these
steve switches it on
something occurs to darren too late
let me see that on the screen the photo of madam octa
steve twists around to keep the camera out of darrens reach
its madam octa
i took it at the show
look at the background
this got taken right on your desk
as they just stare at each other
in her cage on the desk
darren and steve looking her over
howd you do it
they were loading a van outside
i i just took her
just like that
after a look you stole from a vampire you know
just because he had a coffin doesnt mean hes really a
darren trails off
steve realizes darren saw the coffin
you were there werent you
you heard what he said to me
that i was evil
i didnt believe it
steve studies darren hopes thats true
i heard what you said to him too
that you wanted to be a vampire
steve doesnt want to talk about it
he looks at madam octa
how do you think he made her do what he wanted
darren opens his desk drawer pulls out the flute
i wish i knew how to play it
i think that was just for show
i think he used something else
some kind of mind control
you mean telepathy
i bet anyone with a brain could do it
which leaves you out
steve smiles gives darren a little punch in the arm
the tension is loosening
they react to a knock on the door
can i come in
darren goes to the door
opens it a few inches
i swear to god annie
as they talk steve opens the cage door
madam octa sets her arms on the edge pulls herself out
lands on steves shoulder
her fangs wet with poison glint just before she sinks them into steves throat
steve surges upward his shout dying in his throat
he stiffens eyes snapped wide and then crumples to the floor
darren and annie react as madam octa scurries off disappears behind the curtain
darren grabs a baseball bat which leans in the corner
he reaches out pokes at the curtain with it
madam octa drops down onto the window sill wham
wood cracks as darren brings down the bat but madam octa is too quick
she disappears leaping out the open window
darren pulls it shut
he rushes back to steve turns him over
steves skin is already a deathly pale
annie reaches out takes steves hand
darren hes freezing
hospital doors bang open as a gurney bearing steve is rushed through
darren and his dad follow with a doctor
what kind of spider was it
i think some kind of a tarantula
where is it
it got away
darrens dad holds up the camera
we have a picture of it
the doctor takes it as a nurse meets the gurney
get doctor lund
and we need to download a photo to poison control
this is as far as darren goes
steve is wheeled in surrounded
syringes are drawn handed in
all we can see of steve is one skinny arm hanging out
push in on darren
sick for steve
unaware that his world has only just started to crash down around him
tough no nonsense
marching along carrying a print out coming to a stop where darren sits on a plastic chair
he sticks the print out into his face
the photo of madam octa
how did you make this and why would you make this
darrens mom and dad start over from down the corridor
poison control couldnt id it
in fact the department of entomology at harvard couldnt find it in their data base
so either its a new species or its a fake photo
if my son said he took that photo then thats the truth
lund just stares at darren
then what have you done to him
steves mom approaches her eyes on darren
disheveled cheap looking she hasnt quite started her hangover yet
she lunges past darrens dad grabs darren by the shoulder
did you hurt stevie
she shakes darren hard
darrens dad gets between them
she breaks down sobbing
darrens mom tries to soothe her as she moans about what a bad mother she is
your friends going to die unless we find out whats in him
he looks down to where light spills out from steves room
his friend is going to die in there
darren as he lays in bed staring at the ceiling
his clock switches to am
deciding darren gets out of bed
dressed darren climbs out the window starts down
dead lonely as darren approaches steps up to the glass door
as he leans in to look into the lobby the door gives a little
darren pushes it open with a finger
darrens by the credenza where he hid
the coffin is gone
move with darren who comes up from below and crosses
stay with him as he parts the curtains and comes out on the
where he stops short sees in the center of the stage crepsleys coffin
a beat and darren steps up
he grips the lid starts sliding it back
he looks inside to see
madam octa perched on the side staring back at him
darren stumbles back
the coffin lid slams to the stage as darren loses his footing lands on his butt
and then applause
one pair of hands create a hollow echo
crepsley sits alone in the middle of the theater
and then hes gone
only to reappear over darren offering a hand up
darren scrambles to his feet
what have you come for this time
darren pulls out a crucifix holds it in crepsleys face
the vampire takes it looks it over
it has no effect
crosses dont hurt you
why should they
are vampire bats evil when they drink the blood of cows
bats are animals
so am i
so are you
our appetites dont make us evil
as darren ponders
why are you here
your spider bit my friend steve
crepsley shrugs tosses darren back his crucifix
yes well boys who play with things they do not understand can hardly complain if
you have to help him
the antidote to her poison is rare
why should someone as evil as i am waste it on steve
ill pay you back
if it takes years
whatever it costs
money doesnt interest me
theres something you want
thats why youre here waiting for me
crepsleys surprised and pleased by darrens intuitiveness
the night steve came below to speak to me you were there
did you hear what we talked about
he wanted to
become like you
you dont just become a vampire
the change is too extreme
and if the shock didnt kill you your inexperience would
so you become one in stages
a half vampire at first
with greater strength than a human but still able to go out in sunlight
you learn from a full vampire
do you understand
i think so
but your friend has bad blood
hes no good
theres no telling what hell become as he matures
i dont believe that someone can have bad blood
and yesterday you didnt believe in vampires
regardless ive left the cirque
left my protection
i need someone to protect me while i sleep
i need an apprentice
theres no way
then your friend will die
the words hang in the air
you hardly have a choice
its your destiny
that doesnt make sense
try this then
youre reckless enough to steal responsible enough to come back for a friend
thats enough for me
not for me
yes well destiny cant be explained
it must be lived
now youre wasting my time
theres gotta be another way
hes my friend
and he slips away while we argue
life or death
yes or no
youd never be able to trust me
if i got a chance for payback id take it
yes or no
thoughts rush then stop
darren finally just nods
crepsley raises his right hand
the nails are not especially long but they look thick and sharp
crepsley takes darrens hand jabs at his forefinger draws blood
he dabs off a drop smells it then tastes it
you have good blood
crepsley lifts his own left hand
he presses the nails of his right into the fleshy tips of his left hand fingers
then he uses the left nails to mark the right fingers in the same way
blood drips down all ten fingers
lift your hands
darren does as hes told
crepsley digs all ten nails into all ten of darrens fingertips
darren jerks back in pain
get used to pain
more lies ahead
he motions to his hands
darren raises them fingers spread
crepsley presses his fingertips to darrens
as their eyes lock darren frowns at an alien sensation
the blood flows into your left arm and out of your right
do you feel it
getting near your heart
darren nods shivers
a force arcs through darrens body
he screams falls down
crepsley turns away starts to lick the blood from his fingertips
tries to block out darrens soft whimpering
tries to block out any sympathy he feels
the world will start to slow down
youll become a witness of time
snaps out of it your friends time is running out
he pulls darren to his feet
they step out into the moonlight
darren a little wobbly
take my arm
dont let go
darren takes hold
crepsley starts to move
only it seems more like hes still and the ground is moving under his feet
darren looks about as the building begin to streak past the road a blurred ribbon
the night has a weird chromatic look
the world moving faster crepsley and darren slipping past
a moment later and theyre in the
crepsley pulls loose darrens hand
theyre still bleeding
lick your fingers
vampire spit will stop wounds from bleeding
darren looks at his fingers then around the lot
howd we get here
its called flitting
which room is your friend in
tubes run in and out of steve
his breathing is labored
crepsley leans over him rolls up one of steves eyelids
darren watches as crespley looks into steves eye
were in time
he still has a few minutes left
crepsley takes a small amber vial from his pocket
he breaks a wax seal then pinches out a small blackened cork
he pulls the drip line out of the iv catheter and empties a drop of the vials dark viscous contents inside
it swirls murkily coloring the liquid on its way into steves arm
a beat and then steve seems to convulse his arms and legs twitching
is he dying
he was near death
the journey back is not pleasant
what do you know about him this boy with bad blood
hes my friend
whos his father
never met him
i dont think steve ever did either
why do you want to know
and then steve comes around
he opens his eyes focuses on darren for a moment
he looks puzzled
and then he drifts off asleep
his breathing growing deeper steadier
darren realizing hes going to be okay
will you come with me now or do you have things to set in order first
thats when it really hits home
hes agreed to leave every thing and go off with a vampire
without really thinking darren starts backing toward the door his eyes on crepsley
darrens almost to the door
crepsley stays where he is
run if you want
it wont help
youre a creature of the night now darren shan
darren turns and bolts leaving crepsley alone
chuckling the vampire tucks steves covers up under his chin
bursting open as darren charges out
running for his life
darren asleep in his bed
the door opens and his mom enters
wake up honey
darren wakes with a start as she gives him a little shake
as he looks about wonders what reality hes in
i just got off the phone
steves going to be okay
the hospital says its a miracle
was it a dream
darren looks down at his hands
on the tip of each finger and two thumbs are small round white scars
darren instinctively hugs his mom
she thinks hes overjoyed cant see his look of terror
she hugs him back
yeah its great news
i know how you feel
the door opens and darren steps out
he takes a long look up and down the street
then he see the sun up in the sky
relaxes a little
he takes a step down the stairs when
from out of the bushes
darren nearly jumps out of his skin
i finally got you
darren turns on her looks like he could kill her
dont ever do that again
annies smile drops away
as darren continues on
darren walking along feeling isolated as he moves past the other students
everything seems weird off
a couple of kids rush past him going into a classroom
then a couple more coming the other way
hey shan you gotta see this
they duck into the classroom
twenty or so kids all pressed around the boa constrictor tank
steve holds court
doctor said it was a miracle
they say im unique steve spots darren as he steps up in the back
ive been looking for you
we got a lot to talk about
steve holds out a fist
a mouse pokes its head out through an opening in the hand
its whiskers twitch
as darren looks from the mouse to the snake
steve addresses the kids does his best mr
he tries to be entertaining but he comes off creepy
welcome to cirque du steve
what happens to us all can happen to any of us
if you watch its by your own free will
to crepsley the mouse
darren reacts to the name
steve lowers his hand into the terrarium
some kids already look away others are intent
darren pushes to the front
anyhow dont watch
and dont blink you might miss it
steve sets the mouse in the terrarium
the mouse takes a few tentative steps
moves toward a corner away from the
snake whos suddenly alert
it raises its head flicks its tongue
coils back on itself
the snake strikes
and darren darts down his hand
catches the snake just below its head out of mid air out of mid strike
the snake twists in darrens hand
the students are blown away
steves eyes narrow his wheels are turning
the bell rings
kids hurry out to class
darren scoops up the mouse drops the snake back in
as he starts out steve cuts him off
what happened to the spider
i killed it
steve hesitates processes looks darren over
i had a dream
you and crepsley were in my hospital room
tell me about it later
darren starts away
steve grabs him hard spins him around
ill tell you now
darren reacts instinctively grabs steve with his free hand and slams him against the wall
steves nearly off the ground only his left toe touching
i said later
darren lets go heads off
steve watches wonders
darren walks home hands in pockets
annie comes up behind
he looks over his shoulder keep going
can i walk home with you
he softens slows down
after a few silent steps
got you something
darren pulls the mouse from his pocket
annie loves it cups it in her hand
coming in low and fast
annie screams as a german shepherd charges stops just short of them
growling like it was rabid
like it hates darren
darren steps between it and annie
darrens pupils dilate oddly he curls his lip to show his own teeth
the dog starts to back off
no its not
kings my buddy
thats king darren
darren realizes it is king
as darren realizes somethings wrong with darren
from down the street
darren looks back as a black lincoln prowls through the intersection
the one seen at school
it slows windows blacked out
as it continues disappears from view
as darren hurries annie along down the street
darren at the kitchen table doing his math homework
his mom makes dinner chopping vegetables at the sink
how was school today
sometimes it was boring sometimes really boring
darrens mom laughs
she drops the knife on the cutting board
a thick drop of blood runs down her finger
darren flinches at the sight and in that moment we punch into his eyes
the pupils swirl red the irises flatten and narrow
a dark ravenous look
holding up her finger
her skin tone receding back into gray the blood pulsing with red vibrancy
standing at the bloods seeming siren call
but as he suddenly moves forward she turns away
darren stops as she wraps her finger in a paper towel
she looks back at him misunderstands his hunger for concern
its okay honey
i just need a band aid
darren looks at his moms neck
his eyes zero in on a little blue vein pulsing away
she leaves the room to get a band aid
as darrens horror sinks in
darren looks at his reflection in the mirror
looking for reassurance
he curls his lip checks his teeth
they look normal
he reaches out
trying to reach himself
his hand comes to a stop against the glass
his nails click hard against the surface
he scrapes the nail of his forefinger along the glass
it leaves a deep scratch
darren starts to freak a little
his breath getting ragged
he tries to get a hold of himself looks back in the mirror
darren walks down an aisle climbs up onto the empty stage
dark but darren moves calmly like it was noon
darren turns sees him
crepsley raises his hands to the gloom around them
the darkness isnt so scary anymore is it
im starting to think its me thats scary
crepsley waits to hear more
its only gonna get worse isnt it
theres no way back is there
no magic potion to make me human again
crepsley shakes his head
darren nods that he understands
we made a deal
i wont run away again
its neither here nor there but i do feel sorry for you
darren waves it off doesnt want to hear it
are you ready then
the night is young
we can make many miles
i cant just my family i cant let them think i just left them
or that something happened to me
my mother would
as darren trails off crepsley really does look sympathetic
theres only one thing for it
well have to kill you
darrens parents watching cnn
darren comes in
im going to bed
they say good night to him
impulsively darren kisses his dad on the cheek then does the same to his mom
i love you both
i dont say it that much but i do
darrens mom is caught off guard but happy to hear it
we love you too
dont we tommy
of course we do
darren looks at them a beat then smiles satisfied
they watch him go then exchange looks
who knows how they think
annie asleep already
darren enters pulls his sisters blanket up tucks it under her chin
he whispers goodbye knucklehead
if i can ever help you i will
darren enters to find crepsley sitting at his desk
he holds a small dark bottle between his fingers different than the one he gave to steve
as crepsleys about to speak
off crepsleys reaction
this is my home and im never gonna see it again so dont rush me
crepsley makes a motion to zip his lips
all the same he stands unscrews the bottle as darren takes a last look around
he takes a photo of his family off the dresser
hold onto this for me okay
crepsley takes the photo offers darren the bottle in return
darren sniffs recoils at the foul smell
youre sure it will work
crepsley opens the window
your heart will slow down so drastically they wont find a pulse
with the fall from the window theyll think youre dead
what if i break bones
theyll mend in a few days
vampires dont stay broken for long and it takes a very long fall to kill one
and the funeral home
wont they embalm me or something
i have ways of making my thoughts become the thoughts of others
theyll leave you alone
crepsley gestures to the window
knowing the plan darren climbs out his foot resting on the trellis
he looks to the ground back to crepsley as an odd thought hits him
my dads allergic to grass
its my job to cut the lawn
you have a new job now
darren steels himself gulps it down hands the bottle back
so this is destiny huh
tastes like crap
darren body seizes up
he lets go but crepsley grabs him
your breathing is slowing your heart as well
do you feel it
darren cant answer
he blinks his eyes yes instead
you may be aware of whats going on around you
remember the grief that you hear will be a release for those who express it
darrens eyes drift shut
crepsley lets him go
darren falls crashes through the trellis and thumps into the lawn
crepsley looks down from the window then disappears
close on darren lying face down in the grass
beyond a neighbor walks his dog
the dog suddenly turns in the direction of darren pulls on its leash
no no come on the neighbor stops short as he sees the body
hey hey kid he rolls darren over realizes something is very wrong
we stay on darren the dog sniffing at him as the neighbor disappears toward the front door
we hear his fist pound
a moment later darrens father is there
he looks at darren up to the open window realizes he fell
an instant later hes on his knees cradling his son
a moment later his mom
oh my god
were still on darrens face his eye open a slit
his parents hovering over him in despair
the stars twinkle
the neighbor leans in
is he dead
darrens body on a stainless steel table
the medical examiner shakes his head sadly looks to his assistant
cause of death is trauma from the impact of the fall
are we doing an autopsy
reveals crepsley watching from around a darkened corner
not on a child
im not going to cut open a kid
not when i dont have to
darren in his coffin wearing a suit
friends and family passing by
the sounds of people crying
two cute girls from school lean in
hes still cute
i always had a crush on him
the goalie from school soccer is next
he holds a little soccer ball in his hand
tucks it into the coffin
for the next life shan
top right corner every time
annie steps up gently strokes her brothers cheek
then suddenly overwhelmed she buries her face in their dads chest
he leans in tenderly over his son
choked up i love you darren
you said it the other night i didnt say it back
visiting hours are over
a hand reaches down a thumb opens his eyelid
of the ceiling for a moment then a blinding light flashing back and forth
then glimpses of steves face
steve holds darrens eye open shines a penlight into it
the pupil doesnt dilate
steve switches it off pockets it as the funeral director enters
i know its difficult but visiting hours are over
steve nods sadly looks to darren
he pats one of darrens hands which are folded across his chest
in reality steve checks darrens fingertips
a white scar at the end of each one
steves crazy idea may be confirmed
darrens coffin is lowered into the ground
ashes to ashes dust to dust in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to come
darrens dad tosses a handful of earth down onto the coffin
the lid an inch from his face
his eyelid twitching as we hear shovelfuls of dirt hit the lid
the sound growing duller at each turn
then as darrens eye flickers open
the sound of digging continues
only now dirt is coming out of the hole rather than going in
crepsley is digging the coffin back up
finally he spreads his feet apart pulls open the lid
darren sputters as some of the dirt spills onto his face
crepsley reaches down pulls him up and out of the grave
darren sits on the ground coughing then moaning
on your feet
my legs are asleep
crepsley pulls him up anyhow
darren stumbles a few steps nearly falls before finding his balance
walk it off
ill fill this back in
breathe some air
crepsley closes the coffin begins to fill the hole as darren ambles off
not exactly the start of his best day
passing among the graves stretching his arms twisting
really beat up
he looks about the names and dates on the headstones popping into focus even from far away
suddenly he becomes aware of something steve
on the other side of a mausoleum
ten feet away
what are you doing here
smiles closing in vampire hunting
steve rushes the last step a jagged wooden stake held high over his head
he knocks darren back on the ground
pouncing on top he brings down the stake
darren catches hold of steves wrist
stops the point of the stake just over his heart
steve puts his weight into it
a desperate moment of struggle but darrens strength is resurgent
he throws steve off
steve rolls to his feet comes at him again
darren catches his wrist with one hand his throat with the other
he slams him up against the mausoleum holds him there
what do you have against vampires
you wanted to become one yourself
yeah i wanted to but you did
you stole my dream
you stole my destiny
are you crazy
i did it to save your life
that was the deal
me for you
you told him i was evil
you planned this all along
and youll pay
youll pay darren jams the stake under steves throat
that stops him struggling
the points jabs him as he swallows
i want you to leave
steve is just beginning to realize how strong darren is now
i want you to leave and forget you ever saw me
scared he nods
darren shoves him away brakes the stake in two
steve heads away looks back over his shoulder
im going to hunt you darren
you and the other one
ill put a stake in you and burn you to ashes
ill make sure you never come back from the grave again
steve walks right into crepsley
he picks steve up by the shoulders pulls him close
with a voice like death
if we ever meet again i will show you loneliness you cannot imagine
steve trembles in fear
crepsley lets go
steve takes off running
crepsley looks to darren
do you still question his blood
darrenthoughtful doesnt know what to think
would a stake through the heart kill a vampire
but so would getting hit by a truck if it was going fast enough
steve finally disappears from sight
hell be trouble before its over
before whats over
this adventure were on
shall we start
darren hesitates looks to the twinkling lights of his city
youll get used to it after awhile
vampires are always saying goodbye
a beat then darren looks back at him
as it blisters up into then rises above the horizon
ominous if youre a full vampire
on the edge of the highway
silhouetted against the sun
darren jams a rolled towel along the bottom of a closed door
on the other side better
i know the time
i know more about the sunrise than anyone alive
crespley sounds irritated
darren gets mischievous
maybe ill wait until noon and then open every door and curtain in the place
a long tense silence as darren awaits crepsleys reply
crepsley is a shadow among the shadows
he climbs into bed
yes sunlight would kill me
my electrons are different than a humans
but it would take several hours of exposure
id have plenty of time to kill you before i closed the curtains and went back to bed
crepsley pulls the blanket up over his head
as darren considers this
darren doing pull ups a hand on either side of the top jamb
its almost effortless
bored rather than tired darren drops to his feet
he still wears his burial suit
darren watching the cars go by on the highway spots
darren jots this state down on a list hes keeping
about twenty state license plates so far
a tv droning
bathed in a golden glow that flickers out as the sun sets
the bedroom door opens
crepsley steps over looks down at his snoozing assistant
crepsley claps his hands together nearly against darrens ear
crepsley smiles as darren jolts awake
getting late stores closing
the parking lot nearly empty
darren and crepsley are on a walk and talk
we can die violently
accidentally or otherwise
but we also grow old
a full vampire will age one year for every ten human years hes alive
a half vampire like you one for every five
i dont understand
i was born in
i became crepsley looks back to where darren has stopped short
should we do the math or not
crepsley motions him to keep up
i became a vampire when i was years old
the days of the terror
heads in baskets
guillotines up and down all day
really when humans put their minds to it we vampires can hardly compete
darrens stare jogs him back from the good old days
so ive been a vampire now for years
darren nods again still with him
i age year for every so divided by ive aged about years in that time
that plus my first human makes me look about
but altogether youre plus
youre really years old
youre going to be a teenager for a very long time
they walk on a few steps as darren thinks this over
where do you keep your car anyhow
the one you were driving around my town in
the old black one
ive never owned a car darren
i dont need one
it was near school one day
it followed me home a few days later
and you saw me behind the wheel
i couldnt see who was driving
it wasnt me
as darren considers this crepsley stops suddenly
ahead just more parking lot
a woman exiting a bookstore
the woman nears her car
a chirp as she unlocks it with her remote
she opens the back door sets the book bag on the seat
suddenly she turns like someone called her name
only nobodys there
she shrugs it off closes the back door
but hesitates at the drivers side door
then she starts walking away toward a back area of loading docks
watch from a dumpster by the loading dock
she walks right toward them
one look at crepsleys face and we know he must be willing her over
darren looks terrified
but the air shimmers and crepsley has disappeared
the woman steps up stops across from darren
as she frowns tries to figure out who he is and how she got here
but crepsley appears beside her
he breathes into his hand guides the air into her face
he catches her as she passes out
darren is horrified
did you kill her
i put her to sleep
shell be like this minutes
when she wakes up she wont remember a thing
crepsley eases her to the ground finds a vein on her wrist
will she become a vampire
shed have to share y blood for that to happen
dont take too much
a vampire who feeds often can control himself
one who drinks only when he must can end up feeding wildly
he uses one of his fingernails to open the vein
the hunger inside us must be fed to be controlled
to be civilized
its what separates us from
but as blood oozes he takes the womans wrist td his mouth
darren is repulsed but cant look away
crepsley takes a few deep swallows then holds the wrist out to darren
ill never do it
crepsley runs his tongue over the cut rubs the saliva in
you can lead a vampire to blood but you cant make him drink
im only half vampire
no matter you need blood to live now
youll drink eventually
when youre hungry enough
the wrist is clean the cut gone
a barely perceptible scar
ill die first
dont be stupid
you may abstain tonight but you must feed soon
crepsley stands to go then stops short
tense he looks about more hunted animal than man
as he shrugs it off
what is it
as the woman starts to stir
something out there scares you
what is it
the thought of spending another minute with you
crepsley turns and walks but darrens right
the waitress sets a juicy burger down across from darren
crepsley sits across from him
we still need to eat food too
i just dont need it tonight
darren just sits there
silently as tears begin to run down his cheeks
crepsley is exasperated
i wanted it
i wanted to drink it
of course you did
youre a crepsley catches himself
he is not without some compassion
it was wrong of me to blood you
youre too young
but its done
like the entire history of the world up to this moment
darren quietly cries
crepsley pulls two paper napkins from the dispenser hands them to him
darren turns to face the window as he wipes his eyes nose
then he sees it parked across and down the street
a black lincoln continental
darren looks back at crepsley
lets not waste anymore food tonight
crepsley follows the finger as darren points
the bell over the diner door rings
as he looks back over his shoulder at the door
tiny comes through the front door pimpin
peter lorre on steroids
scary done up like a las vegas high roller
darren knows trouble when he sees it
he looks back at crepsley but the vampire is gone
darren shan we meet at last
darren just looks up at him
the guy is practically leaking nastiness no matter how avuncular he tries to be
youre quite a boy
sacrificed everything to save a friend
whered you hear that
a little bat told me
tiny takes a french fry off darrens plate eats it
darren looks around
where the hell did crepsley go at a time like this
tiny knows what hes thinking
oh hes still here
trying to stay alive
its so quiet around them darren can hear a clock ticking
its a heart shaped pocket watch mr
tiny holds on a chain
would you like to see
the air seems to buzz as something passes
why the fight of course
boys like to watch fights dont they
tiny hefts his watch
it almost seems to melt into his palm
as he pulls the winding knob out with a click
as darren and mr
tiny blink out disappear from the booth
darren and mr
tiny reappear in the booth but the restaurants patrons are slowed to near motionlessness
a battle royal going on
crepsley fighting three vampaneze
all three are sinewy whipcords with blotchy purple skin
crepsley stands surrounded in the middle of the restaurant
whirling hand fighting
blocking their thrusts and blows
darren moves to stand
tiny pushes him back to his seat
crepsley takes one down with a violent leg whip
he drives the second one back into the third knocking both back
a look to darren and then hes back on leg whip whos getting to his feet
crepsley drives his flat hand forward his nails tearing into the vampanezes throat
as leg whips hand instinctively goes to his throat to stem the blood crepsley grabs his free hand sends him airborne
as leg whip unflits
the patrons react to him soaring over the counter slamming into the wall the patrons near frozen again
leg whip sliding ever so slowly down the wall
crepsley and sinewy one two fighting at full speed
sinewy one pulls crepsleys arm up behind his back
crepsley howling as we hear the bone break
tiny grabs darren by the wrist pulls him toward the door
crepsley drives the back of his head into sinewy ones face at the same time as sinewy two swings in his open palm
sinewy one releases crepsley who disappears as sinewy two slices open sinewy ones throat
tiny pulls darren out the door
leg whip hits the floor
blood splashes the wall as sinewy one appears dropping to his knees
as leg whip stands crepsley charges shoulders him halfway through the wall
patrons scream react scatter
as crepsley grabs a knife
darren struggles as mr
tiny pulls him along
behind through the diner windows we see patrons frozen in flight
sinewy two near frozen in fight with crepsley who is in mid swing with the knife in his head
tiny and darren stop across from young murlough
humanoid in shape monstrous in visage
bloated his skin albino white with purplish mottling and red crisscrossing veins
he must weigh pounds but nfl nose tackle style
smell the blood
the lovely blood
his eyes narrow at the sight of crepsley his mouth widening to show two rows of sharp filthy teeth
darren needs to do something
he eyes the watch in mr
he grabs it with his free hand thumbs back in the winding knob
as murlough disappears from view
the window explodes as sinewy two hurtles out
darren tosses the watch high in the air
tiny releases him to move to catch it
darren rushes back toward the restaurant
tiny catches his watch
crepsley meets darren
crepsleys broken arm hangs uselessly from his side
murlough appears alongside
he grabs crepsley by the throat lifts him off the ground
crepsley arcs the knife into murloughs shoulder
murlough staggers lets go
crepsley takes darrens hand and they flit disappearing
beyond the hamburger joint
the world beginning to streak past them
the asphalt begins to blur beneath their feet passing cars like they were standing still
but crepsley heaves for breath
darren looks back over his shoulder
its behind us
crepsley bears down the buildings streaking by
closes regardless relentless death in his eyes
almost out of gas
but looking ahead
clocks in an instant a red light ahead
a car frozen having just crossed the intersection
headlights from a blind corner
just as murloughs about to catch him from behind
crepsley comes out of flit mode disappears
as murlough fades after him
darren and crepsley appear on the far side of the crossing
murlough comes out of flit in the center
the headlights crepsley saw frozen but coming from the blind corner become a pick up broadsiding murlough
he goes up over the hood smashes against the windshield
as darren and murlough disappear again
the pick up brakes
he tumbles off the hood sprawls hard into and skids along the street
a beat and he rolls to a sitting position looks around
no crepsley in sight
blood runs out of one of his ears
as he wipes it smearing it across his cheek
hey man are you okay
he stops short when he sees murloughs face
murlough stands swats the driver aside
the lincoln screeches to a halt alongside him
murlough climbs in
the lincoln tearing away
the sky getting lighter
a sign now entering pennsylvania
the air shimmers as something flits past
clutching his arm mr
crepsley kicks at the door splinters it
opens a gap
darren reaches through unlocks it
as they step inside the first rays of the sun appear through the trees
crepsley climbs down a few steps closes the door behind him
barely any light but some
find a blanket
darren drags a carpet over the root cellar door in the floor
it goes black except for a glint in crepsleys eyes
he sighs settles down on the ground
are you okay
my arms broken
but it should be fine in a day or two
sunlight fills the kitchen
darren sits exhausted
who were they
the one with the watch was mr
how dangerous can a man named mr
who said he was a man
then what is he
tiny cant be explained
he needs to be experienced
and the purple guy
what was he
long ago humans were looked upon as animals by some vampires
cattle to be slaughtered
laws were passed to forbid needless killing
it made it easier to pass unnoticed among humans if we didnt murder them
most vampires obeyed
but some didnt
seventy vampires broke away declared themselves a separate race
over time their appearance changed their numbers grew
they believe its wrong to feed from a human without killing it
they believe those of us who feed in small amounts live like leeches
it led to war
crepsley touches the scar on his face remembers
the last one nearly destroyed us all
theres been a truce for many years now
will you be alright while i sleep
darren looks around at the dilapidated crap heap hes in
as he tries to hold his heart together
this is so much better than where i used to be
crepsley hears the strain in his voice
knows whats best for both of them
what do you think of rejoining the cirque du freak
until you get on your vampire feet so to speak
three eighths if you want
what do you think
as darren thinks
the cirque is camped by an abandoned factory
neo gothic in scale and mood
lit up for a performance
tall pulls on his jacket shouts orders
show time in twenty minutes
someone tell rhamus to get his stomachs in gear
hes surprised to see crepsley and darren walk up the road
crepsleys arm seems much better now
as i live and breathe
i thought it would be years before i saw you again
tall looks to darren throws a surprised look to crepsley
youve come a long way since the last time i saw you
i liked it better where i was
do you still have my coffin
youre really back
perhaps you could do the show tonight
a few of us are absent or ill this evening
id be delighted
shan will have to pull his weight as well
ill give him to evra
i hope i havent gone from one unreliable boy to two
the snake boy from the first cirque show
evra my industrious wonder
here is darren
put him to work with you
show him the snakey ropes
as the two boys consider each other
off with you
as the boys head off mr
tall looks over at crepsley
you blooded a child larten
what were you thinking
you dont approve
i dont matter
what will the vampire generals say when they hear about it
im no longer part of their domain
so you say
they may disagree
as darren and evra make their way through
what do you do
im a snake boy
i do a whole snake thing
evra goes into a slithery snake walk for a few steps to illustrate
evra looks back over
do you eat mice
big macs actually
they share a laugh
evra high fives darren
as they continue darren looks at the palm of his hand
a few of evras scales have come off and are stuck there
i caught your act in the last town
im not doing it tonight
my snake caught a cold
snakes can catch cold
evra nods then sneezes himself
still gotta work the floor though
we get the seats filled
they pass people all hurriedly crossing the camp
who are they all
the backbone of cirque du freak
they do the driving the tent pitching the potato peeling even
how did they end up here
most wandered in
tall likes them they stay
darrens eye is caught by the wolfman
hes being pushed toward the factory building by several of the blue robed little people
the wolfmans yellow eyes are on darren as he rumbles a low guttural growl
darren is so taken that he almost walks into
he stops short
in costume beardless even more beautiful than when we first saw her
she considers darren uses a finger to raise his chin
she shakes her head smiles
as she continues
an odd setting but it works well
stripped ragged weird
feels like a rave
the lighting dramatic the concrete walls ominous
patrons take their seat around a stage
a buzz in the air
about the same age as darren and evra theyre here for the show
debbie is self assured
sam is sarcastic to cover his insecurities
right now its hard to find a seat
and here are darren and evra
evra looking cool in his green sharkskin darren still wearing his burial suit
can we help you find a seat
are there any left
only the best seats in the house
he leads them a few steps over toward a column
you guys are with the cirque
sams a little sarcastic and skeptical
cirque is french right
are you guys french
vous etes observateur
nous sommes les serpents frangais
that slows sam a beat
evra points out a small platform eight feet up the column
you have to climb a natural re bar ladder to get there
sam looks dubious but debbie smiles
im debbie this is sam
she looks at darren waiting
oh im darren
is the show great
we had to sneak out to see it
i snuck out to see it once too
and im still here
an odd almost spooky moment
is he serious
good one darren
debbie and darren
like bonnie and clyde
and their friend evra von what
that breaks the moment
debbie starts climbing the re bar
sam looks darren over a beat picks a thread off his lapel
dude it looks like the kind of suit youd wear to a funeral
you have no idea
evra smiles sticks out his tongue
pointy narrow evra sends it up his own nostril
sam tries to smile then starts up after debbie
as darren and evra laugh
tall under a spotlight
back in his red hat and gloves
welcome to the cirque du freak
we are an ancient circus
bringing the remarkable to generations
darren and evra watch from the back whisper to each other
how long have you known mr
how do you meet someone like him
i was raised in a circus but not a nice one like this
the owner used to beat me and keep me in a glass cage
i felt like a useless freak
one night i looked out of my cage and saw mr
tall just standing there
he watched me until the owner came over and asked if he could help him
tall grabbed him by the throat and strangled him to death
then he opened the cage and said lets go evra
he named me that
i added the von
ive been with him ever since
darren looks back at mr
tall with a new set of eyes
crepsleys back there in the shadows
how do you feel about show business
the audience reacts as crepsley appears on the empty stage
to be poisoned by a spider may be my fate
its darrens cue
looking appropriate in his burial suit he walks out carrying madam octas cage at arms length
as she realizes its darren
darren sees debbie who gives a little wave
as he smiles
darren loses the grin
crepsley opens the cage
madam octa steps to the opening
crespley raises the flute plays
madam octa walks out and up to darrens shoulder where she attaches a web thread
the audience react as she leaps to crepsleys shoulder and attaches the other end
she dances across to the music spinning a web as she goes
darren looks out sees how much debbie enjoys it
set against the black sky
sparks rise up their source unknown
all very mysterious until
lots of it
we follow the sparks down to
blazing in the cirque campgrounds
the freaks are eating drinking wine relaxing after the show
like a gypsy camp
tall sits with his long legs up on a box really enjoying watching everyone else enjoy themselves
evra munches on a sausage he grills on the end of a stick
darren is all ears and eyes
he likes these people
and hes certainly never experienced anything like this
someone starts to play a guitar someone else beats a drum
madam truska starts to dance the fire flickering against her as are all eyes
then she reaches out takes crepsley by the hand
a few moments later the two of them are engaged in a mad tango
it takes the camps collective breath away
even darren cant help but enjoy it
crepsleys arm gives him a twinge or two but only truska notices
a mattress on the floor inside
using tape and cardboard darren blacks out the windows
crepsley steps over
crepsley looks to the sky
the moon setting
darren looks over
im not going to sleep here
well find a nook in the factory
crepsley starts off
darren starts to follow
darren sighs goes back to the van to retrieve the mattress
he starts to pull it out then stops nearly doubled over
concerned crepsley steps over
darren waves him off straightens as whatever it was passes
i just felt sick for a second
you need blood
darren gives him a dirty look grabs the mattress
they start walking toward the factory
the shadows of a loading dock
crepsley and darren approach
you think mr
tiny might come
crepsley shrugs doesnt answer
who is he
what does he want
what we want is who we are dont you think
cant you give me a straight answer just once
you wont learn by me telling you
you must live some things to know what they are
darren sighs in deep frustration
crepsley has a thought
why do you like spiders
darren tires to figure what hes getting at
did you ever think there was a particular reason
it seems crepsley knows the answer even if darren doesnt
i never thought about it
thats the trouble with children
they dont think about things
im not a child
theystop by the shadows
are you a man
if youre not a man youre a child
im in between
in between does not exist
the words echo a moment
darren no closer to understanding
ill sleep in here tonight
but sit outside the van tomorrow and make it look like im there
its just caution
old habits die hard
and old vampires
without a sound someone has reached around the two of them from behind a razor knife held to each of their throats
they stand dead still
we can make out the shape of a head as whoever it is leans in ever so slightly from the dark
gavner purl as always i heard you coming from a mile away
in his hand by his side mr
crepsley holds a thin switchblade
he presses the steel back ever so slightly
well call it a draw then
the voice pulls back his knives steps out
its gavner purl
he was once handsome but those days are long gone
his face is crossed with scars
they vary in size thickness and color
gavner is a warrior carries himself so
its been too long larten
darrens trying to catch up
you guys are friends
we once shared a coffin together
for six months
to save money
we were being hunted
who was hunting you
darren gavner purl
gavner extends his hand to shake
darren seesthe scars on gavner purls fingertips
darren raises his own hand so gavner can see his scars
gavner looks at crepsley
a half vampire
we dont make full vampires of our assistants
gavner purl looks at crepsley stunned
nor do we make assistants of children
gavner purl contd a child larten
i have my reasons
and they are
i dont owe answers to vampires anymore
im exiled from our kind self exiled
and i at least am owed an answer
theres a personal history being called upon here
crepsley is well aware
darren again is left out
all i care to say is a boy sought me out knew who i was
he asked me to make him my assistant
gavner looks to darren suspicious
and how did you know it wasnt darren
his blood was bad
i should have killed him but i didnt
gavner considers it all
i met darren shortly after
his blood was good or i certainly would have killed him
darren reacts again
how could a boy find you
of course he had help
he tried to kill us
he tried to kill me
what he wanted with you wasnt determined
perhaps you chose the wrong boy
a moment as they consider the unspoken implications
what are you guys talking about
no answer as crepsley and gavner lock each other in a look
whats important enough to track down an exile
what is your news
im not interested in your wars
well the other side is interested or they wouldnt be trying to get rid of you
crepsley gets suddenly very angry
ive had enough killing
youve come to the wrong place
i am the wrong place
gavner raises his hands in surrender
even so im glad youre alive
the sun is coming
will you stay
i can still make miles
the war wont wait
and neither will bad news
i have to go
then travel safely
would you mind if i walk a bit with your assistant
take him with you if you want
hes of little use to me
darren and gavner purl walk
gavner looks him over
you look sick
doesnt larten feed you
i wont drink blood if thats what you mean
i promised myself
youll get insulted
as gavner waits for darren to tell him
im afraid if i drink blood ill become evil
gavner laughs out loud catches himself
the only thing drinking blood will do to you is keep you alive
thats how it would start
i would swear it was just to stay alive
but whatll i turn into
youre on one side of the fence or the other
my father used to say that and now i know what he meant
the father part chokes darren up a bit
youve already turned darren
you need to accept what youve already become
theres no going back
they walk in silence a moment
then why did crepsley make himself an exile anyhow
he was tired of all the killing
we were at war
with the vampaneze
crepsley was once a vampire general
one of our great leaders
he may seem reluctant but i assure you no one is as skilled at killing vampaneze than crepsley is
i think thats why theyd like to get him out of the way
kill him off before the new war starts
youve known him a long time
i was his assistant
he blooded me as he blooded you
theres almost something comforting in this news
gavner purl so proud and strong looking
darren wants to know
whyd he choose you
to teach me to kill vampaneze
up until now its the only reason he ever chooses anyone
is it why he chose me
gavner hesitates not sure
thats for crepsley to say
another brick wall but darren accepts it
do you know what the biggest danger is to a vampire darren
its that they live so long they no longer care
everything they love is left behind until they finally have nothing left to live for
the fact that hes taken an apprentice seems to me a good sign
a sign that hes thinking of living not dying
lucky for me
glad i could help
all the same darren considers what hes heard
gavner meanwhile considers the open countryside ahead
a clear run
gavner gives darren one last appraising look
stay by him darren
stay by him
gavner takes a deep breath
the air around him shimmers his image bouncing in and out of phase like an electron heating up
and then hes gone
that part is definitely cool
high in the noon sky
pan down to where darren stands under a tree by the old van
he concentrates looks himself over
he concentrates again
hes trying to flit
very briefly the air shimmers around him then stops
he looks at his arms
little wisps of smoke come off them
its smells like burnt hair
evra follows his gaze turns just in time to see debbie and sam ducking inside the factory
exchange a look
start after them
where the show was the night before
light streams down from gaps in the decrepit roof
no sight of debbie and sam as darren and evra make their way in
they pause at a creaking coming from somewhere overhead
as they move
darren and evra come off a rickety staircase pass through a half rotted door
there are holes in the roof overhead and huge gaps on the floor where the boards have fallen through
they see sam his back to them staring out a smashed window
lets scare the crap out of him
they begin to creep in flanking the unsuspecting sam
but as they get close a shape drops down behind them
darren and evra are the ones who jump
the shape is debbie
she almost falls over laughing
so does sam
you should see the look on your faces
but evra and darren are not laughing
whatre you doing here
we could ask you the same thing
we come here all the time
my grandfather used to work here
mustve been a long time ago
he says now its like one of those bombed out world war ii cathedrals
empty of what is used to be
an odd little moment till sam breaks it
hey we loved the show man
it was off the hook
messing with him off the hook huh
ill tell all the freaks you said so
are you guys on your own
no parents or nothing
he says it with a little twinge that debbie picks up on
no school either
youre the luckiest guys on earth
wanna switch places
you have to be different to be here
evra steps into a slash of sunlight and his skin flashes to life the green of his scales catching the rays
debbies mouth drops
they couldnt see it in the dark last night
everyone has a place they belong
the cirque du freak is ours
i think your skin is beautiful
that wins evra over
can i touch it
evra holds out his arm
debbie traces a finger across it
has it always been this way
hes a snake boy
you shouldnt call him names because he looks different
i am a snake boy
you could say youre dermatologically challenged
they all laugh
debbie considers evra a beat then darren
what about you darren
how are you different
i get scared easy
darren looks up toward the rafters
from where she dropped
howd you get up there anyhow
you mean how did a girl get up there
a spot where the roofing is gone several long rafters stretch out
darren evra and sam watch debbie walk out on one
like a balance beam
the factory floor feet below
hey be careful
shes like a gymnast
debbie moves slowly at first her arms stretched out for balance
then she does a hop a skip
darren and evra gasp
she gets to the other side turns and bows
how about you
i got nothing to prove
but itd be easier for you than me
because chickens have wings
she starts chicken clucking
mad darren steps onto a rafter starts across
he stops in the middle spins around
aided immeasurably by his half vampire skills
debbie is impressed
the vertigo angle as debbie walks back out on her rafter
stops about feet across from darren
darren crosses his arms across his chest
no big deal
lets play mirrors
i do something and you have to copy me
debbie crosses her arms the same way darren has
he uncrosses them as he realizes
debbie reaches down touches her toes
darren sighs then does the same gets a good look at the floor below
debbie takes one foot off the rafter takes hold of the top of it with one hand raising the other arm out for balance
looks like a ballerina
evra doesnt like this daredevil stuff
come on guys
not because he wont do it but because maybe for the first time in his life hes really fascinated by a girl
debbie misreads starts clucking again
darren smiles repeats her move effortlessly
without warning debbie leaps the gap lands on the rafter alongside darren
as she struggles a bit for balance darren reaches out and steadies her
as they come face to face
there definitely something different about you
i just cant figure it out
is sam your boyfriend
hes my cousin
a funny awkward beat out on the rafter
we should get off this
she nods a bit smitten
as they start off
chalk it up to lack of blood but everything starts spinning
the area is like a big drain and hes whirling down it
darren legs go out and he falls off
as debbie screams
darren catches hold of the rafter just as he drops past it
debbie grabs his arm
evra starts out to help but the rafter creaks ominously
sam states the obvious
i dont think itll hold you dude
thanks for the heads up
shakes it off its okay
darren swings up a leg hooks it over the rafter
a beat and hes back on top
evra backs up the way he came and in a few seconds theyre all safely off the rafter
i dont know how you hung on
i couldnt have
you wouldnt have fallen in the first place
i just got dizzy
maybe you need to eat something
darren looks at her
she has no idea
well the foods down on ground level
lets get out of here
sam and debbie start off darren and evra following
as sam and debbie start down a ladder darren hangs back a beat
shes kindof cool huh
i mean for a girl
i like her
she asks a lot of questions though
shes just curious
theres no such thing as just with a girl
what makes you such an expert
my snakes a girl
the sun peeps below the horizon
darren walks along flashlight in hand
he suddenly stops listens not sure if he heard something
a following footstep
move with darren as he continues
as he passes through a doorway he ducks around the corner
waits a few beats
then he leaps out to see whos following
no ones there
shaking his head he continues on
darren knocks on a door waits a beat before it opens and crepsley emerges from his sleeping place
good morning darren
whats good about it
crepsley looks him over doesnt like what he sees
bustling with activity
nearly show time
crepsley stands by an open tent flap watching darren cross camp
he stops as sam and debbie catch up with him
darrens happy to see them
you guys are coming to the show again tonight
evras doing his snake act tonight
oh you came to see evra
darren smiles shyly at that
i was hoping for amanda bynes
darren sees crepsley watching him from the tent
hey ill catch up with you later
i got some stuff i gotta finish up
they watch as darren heads off
hes gonna be gone in another day or two
tonights the last show
i know that
so stop looking at him like you love him
youre such an idiot sam
darren joins crepsley a little unsteady
look at you
you can barely stand
you need to feed
you need blood
i wont let you hunt some poor person down for me
i crepsley grabs hold of darren hauls him into
dark the inside walls richly embroidered
no need to hunt
theres someone here willing to save you
from the shadows madam truska
she steps up
eyes on darren she offers crepsley her wrist
by my own free will darren shan
as crepsleys fingernail hovers ready to open a vein
darren shakes his head
drink or youll die
crepsley releases truskas arm
and youll be nothing
darren stands there as noble and sad as a boy could be
i am human
in my heart i am
a great big tear rolls down truskas cheek
thats the last thing crepsley needed to see
people in their seats or taking them
darren is back in his role as usher
he seats two people wipes at the sweat beading on his forehead
hes getting sicker
he sees debbie
she and sam are already seated across the way
she smiles waves
darren forces a smile waves back
looking for more patrons darren nearly walks into
a hat pulled down obscures his face
an usher in the house of usher
and i cant seem to find a seat
darren frowns at the odd voice but leads down the aisle
darren brings him down to a handful of seats
the figure looks up from under the brim of his hat
i dont think so
as darren moves to go mr
tiny clamps a hand around his wrist
he sits pulling darren down beside him
its time we had a few moments
folks involved in epic struggles should get to know each other
darren doesnt answer
has crepsley told you about me
he said you cant be explained
you need to be experienced
he gives me too much credit
darren looks up to see debbie and sam
were gonna sit on this side
cuz we miss you so much
she digs sam with her elbow
they sit just a row in front
choosing sides can only lead to trouble
never ever choose sides unless its your own
youve chosen the vampaneze
tiny laughs slaps his knee even
is that really what you think
a smart boy like you
and the lights drop
a trumpet blasts and all is silent
the little people wheel out a cage
theres a gurgled growl
the little people retreat
several audience members lean in then scream as the wolfman crashes to the front of the cage
a white spot shines down on mr
ladies and gentlemen
subjugators and saps
welcome to the cirque du freak
we are an ancient circus
tall drones on
oh his speeches are impossible
tiny opens his free hand
his pocket watch melts up into view from his palm
time begins to speed up around them
talls voice speeds to a buzz as he keystone cops off the stage and rhamus keystones on
the audiences small movements become rattles and shakes
only darren and mr
tiny are at normal speed
im not so complicated darren
during war there are those who profit
a war between vampires and vampaneze would have terrible consequences
i am a profiteer
i exact fees and gains
on stage madam truska exits and evra keystones through his performance with his snake
did crepsley tell you of the prophesy
they say the final battle between vampires and vampaneze will be decided by a child
thats why the vampires wont blood children
to avoid the end of the world
as these words are pondered by darren
i think i underestimated you
i think you could be wonderful
i think youre a creep
i think you suck
tiny closes his hand around the watch
time returns to normal
the applause for evra slowing down to normal speed
as he walks off the stage debbie looks back at darren
he was great
as she looks back to the stage someone sits on darrens other side
collar pulled up head wrapped in a scarf
low re debbie is it dar wrens girlfriend
forget about her murlough takes hold of darrens other wrist
still low she has plenty of lovely blood inside
inside outside hmmm
murlough pulls him close hisses in his ear flashing those filthy teeth
i dont care about humans
i dont care about you
but the vampire larten crepsley him i care about
murlough is a vampire killer
on stage the spotlight hits crepsley
you guys are in trouble
theres more than one vampire now
gavner purl is here
murlough reacts to the name
does not like it
have you seen purl gavners face
young murlough sliced it for him
darren youre a liar
hes a thousand miles gone by now
and master crepsley is right there
as he points at crepsley
holding madam octas cage
aware somethings in the air
shimmers phases into flit mode
the audience laughs
like darrens worried about madam octa
debbie looks back knows something is wrong
tinys hand around darrens wrist
as murlough appears alongside crepsley
madam octas cage drops to the stage as murlough knocks crepsley fifteen feet through the air
he lands flat on his back
the audience cheer
think its part of the show
murlough reaches into his jacket produces a razor sharp long knife in either hand
crepsley pops to his feet
as his own single blade switches to life in his hand
as darren struggles mr
tiny switches his grip to the back of the boys neck
that holds him
cheers as murlough charges forward the long knives pinwheeling in his hands
his attack is brutal and blunt
crepsley is driven back parrying each thrust and attack as it comes
sparks fly as the blades connect
from out of nowhere crepsley adds a backhand to the mix
it catches murlough hard across the chops
tall and evra watch
not knowing what to do
murlough swings back wildly
crepsley catches the blade in murloughs left hand with the one in his right
crepsley catches murloughs left wrist the second blade dangerously close to retracing the scar on crepsleys face
crepsley throws himself back sending murlough head over heels across the stage and slamming into a concrete wall
trying to flit
murlough rolls to his feet charges
its brute force versus style
but as crepsley moves to sidestep murloughs not so brutish after all
he matches the move buries one of his knives into crepsleys stomach
crepsley reacts frozen in shock
the audience around them unsure
its part of the show right
darren sees murlough raise the other knife to finish crepsley off
darren trembling phasing
tinys holding nothing but air
darren is gone
speeding down to the stage
the dagger descends in slo motion but its only a centimeter or two from its target
darren reappears leaps onto murloughs back knocks him off target
as murlough staggers right crepsley staggers left
murlough regroups charges after him
badly hurt stumbling crepsley falls off the edge of the stage
roaring murlough grabs darren
they disappear as well
this is not how its supposed to go
sam and debbie leave their seats head for the stage
murlough with darren in tow looking high and low for crepsley
moving past the barely moving mr
tall and evra
his back to a wall
trying to hold it together
frozen patrons facing the exit beyond
as heloses his flit power the patrons suddenly resume real speed for the exits
the old power plant
pipes and catwalks
murlough and darren here
a chain hangs from the ceiling
murlough lifts darren wraps it around his ankle
hangs darren upside down
reacting to murloughs voice
murlough twists darrens arm
darren screams out in pain
reacting as debbie and sam arrive
they move toward it
listening as the scream fades off
clutching his stomach crepsley moves
murlough pulls darren a little higher
theyre face to face though darren is upsidedown
crepsley will come for his assistant
he doesnt care about me
murlough has an assistant too
a smart one smarter than you
as murlough says this darren looks past as stepping up grinning is murloughs assistant
steve holds up his hands so darren can see the white scar on the tip of each finger
he gets closer
tiny made my dream come true
im half vampaneze instead of a stupid half vampire
tiny says i have a destiny
he says hes gonna make sure of it
is that who you talked to
was that the internet guy
pretty funny huh
he introduced himself after you left town
but i think ive known him a long time in my head
in my bad bad blood
maybe steve is evil
he leans in even closer
he gave me back the dream you stole
murlough motions steve quiet slaps a hand over darrens mouth
crepsley moving forward
he slows stops
as he looks back over his shoulder
somethings behind him
freeze as crepsley looks back in the direction from which they follow
from their pov crepsley suddenly disappears
whered he go
they jump as crepsley appears right in front of them
get them out of here
evra knows its useless
as he nods crepsley turns and strides back toward where he had been
sam and debbie exchange a look
what the hell
you guys better go back
what are you gonna do
darrens my friend
sams not so sure but he nods in agreement
darren swings back and forth in long strokes like a pendulum a rag stuffed in his mouth to silence him
sweeping the room
it fixes on a doorway
looking about everywhere but at darren
crepsley speaks to the room
i can smell it
why does it hide
the vampire is here
murlough drops from above
lands ten feet in front of crepsley
as they begin to arc around each other
the vampire will die
lets get readyyyyy to rumble
crepsley looks up reacts
even the creatures of the night watch too much tv
darren swings past through the middle of it all
crepsley sidesteps darren decides to take the fight higher
he leaps up swings himself up onto one of the catwalks
they use the room steel as monkey bars as they climb clash
violent quick attacks
crepsley gaining a position abandoning it as murlough slams in
has lost sight of them he can only hear the battle now
he reacts as evra debbie and sam rush out
evra takes hold lifts tries to lessen the load on the chain
sam unhook his legs
as sam struggles debbie pulls the rag from darrens mouth
are you guys nuts
get outta here
its against our code
suddenly unhooked darren hits the ground
he looks up at evra who grins down at him
never leave a freak behind
on the catwalks murlough draws his knives
crepsley jumps to the space he wants to defend draws his own
two very serious predators at work
the animal kingdom at its killing best
murlough a bull crepsley a matador
he redirects one of murloughs arcing arms smashing it against a metal housing
one of the vampanezes knives clatters away
its not graphic or bloody but several times crepsleys knife finds its way into murloughs body
it enrages him but crepsley continues dealing out punishment
hes now like a brilliant counter puncher even as he inadvertently backs his way into a corner
but as quarters close in murloughs rage works to his advantage
he charges into crepsley his lowered shoulder sending crepsley through the air and into
and through a brick wall
into the thin air outside
still raging murlough nearly falls through himself
instead he slips drops about twenty feet down inside the building
crepsley falls sixty feet lands flat on his back as brick and concrete rain on top of him
as evra pulls darren along
debbie and sam riding shotgun
i think im dying
he looks horrible
lets carry him if we have to
evra and sam support him on either side
they continue start across part of a darkened backstage area
a dark rectangular shape looms ahead
we hear a guttural growl sees eyes glow in the gloom
its the wolfman
hes in his cage
they move forward again the cage becomes visible
but another shape beside it
he sets his hand on the cages heavy latch
hes going to open it
steve lifts the latch
even he doesnt expect the force the wolfman hits the door with
evra steps bravely forward
the wolfman sends him flying
sam cant hold darren up by himself
he doesnt even see the wolfman leap over
as darren sinks to the floor
the wolfman tears into sam
reacts in horror
hes more surprised than shocked
until the wolfman looks his way
then he heads for the hills disappears into the dark
the wolfman turns back toward debbie
she backs away takes off up a rickety stairway
the wolfman howls then follows
darrens too weak to follow near tears in frustration and regret
he watches after them then he looks over at sam
sam who is dying
just a few feet away
his eyes flicker to darrens
he tries to say something but cant
darren crawls over takes sams bloody hand
go save debbie darren
sam manages the smallest smile
as his eyes drift shut
i think she loves you
from above we hear debbie scream
darren considers sams blood knows what he has to do
leave his humanity behind and cross the line
he needs to drink sams blood
forgive me sam but i need strength
i need blood
as darren extends his nails over sams wrist
were going to save her together
debbie backing into a corner
the wolfman almost on her
pure animal action as he tears into wolfie sends him retreating licking his wounds into the darkness
murlough heaves for breath pretty beat up himself
and here comes steve
is crepsley dead
young murlough lives but hes hurt
what can i do
what can dar wrens girlfriend do
we need to get the blood inside outside
then we hear it a blood curdling scream filters up
its hes drunk sams blood
his sickness wicking off him
he screams again the sound taking shape into words
the audience who havent left react as the chilling sound reaches them
fully vampire powered he takes the stairs two at a time
murlough looming over debbie smiles as darren arrives
let her go
stop being a big shot
this isnt like stopping some fight at school
shut up steve
murloughs eyes go very very dark
darren tries to meet the onslaught but hes bowled over
knocked in a heap
debbie moves to go after murlough from behind
shes going to go down fighting as well
but steve intercepts her
hes pretty powerful himself
murlough pulls darren to his feet stands him up
he swings his fist in a vicious arc
darren just ducks it and murloughs fist smashes right through the wall an inside wall alongside darrens head
murloughs getting tired of darren
you need to stand still so you can die
but as he attempts to pull his arm back through he cant
then his eyes widen in pain
murlough jerks his arm back as hard as he can
the wall smashes open as murlough brings his arm back through with crepsley hanging onto the end of it
the audience who remain chanting refund
they react as debris falls from above smashes to the stage
crepsley brings up his knife
murlough catches him by the wrist with one hand
with the other he grips crepsley by the throat slams him hard into an i beam pillar
then he squeezes
we can hear the cartilage crunching in crepsleys throat
but crepsley covers his own right hand with his left
he drives the knife blade into murloughs heart
murlough looks down at the handle of the knife then back at crepsley whose throat he still holds
murlough gives him a lopsided grin and then pitches back falling through one of the holes in the floor
taking crepsley with him
screams from the audience as murlough descends
somewhere in mid fall crepsley flits disappears
when murlough hits the center of the stage he hits it alone
as people start for the exits we see mr
tinyis among them
but as darren stands its not over
steve grabs debbie pushes her to the edge where the rafters are
or ill throw her off
i mean it
it sounds like he does
darren looks intently at debbie
she looks back
then darren makes chicken cluck sounds
understanding debbie tears herself away
to the precipice
but instead of falling she continues out on a rafter
steve slides out after her
but as he reaches for her she deftly skips across the rafters jumps back to the floor
before steve can follow darren cuts him off
below them rows of jagged rusty pipes
the remains of a pumping station
shredded now broken
waiting to impale
its over steve
they come together trading shots stumbling but still having to make the rafters
a missed footfall will be their last
they separate try to gain position
you wanna hear something funny
after your funeral i went to see your parents
they continue circling
and they were fine
they acted like they barely remembered you
darren lunges but steves ready
he cuffs darren in the head
darren falls ends up hanging
steve looms smiling
and your sister
she was moving into your room
they had a yard sale
i bought some of your stuff
steves foot on his hand
darren about to die
oddly did you steal money from my moms purse
darren hanging there dead grim
why do you ask
is knowing that gonna help you rest in peace
its just practically the last thing that ever happened between me and my dad was i was arguing with him
least you had a dad to argue with
a fury building in darren
i was telling him he was wrong about you
thats the last time we had together
fighting about you
hate to tell ya
your dad was right
how do you think we got the money for the dumb tickets
i took it
just like im gonna take you
steve jams his foot down into darrens face but darren hangs on
in fact with a superhuman surge he hauls himself up no matter how many times steve hits him
darren lets steve have it
i miss him
do you understand
i miss him so much
steves arm pinwheel for balance
hes going over
but just as he pitches off the end rafter
darren catches him by his belt
nearly bent backward he hangs back over the abyss
if darren lets go steve will fall into the spikes below
crespley steps up beside debbie knows what darren should do
kill him darren
do it now so you wont have to do it later
darren looks at steve
a moment theyll remember forever
he used to be my friend
darren flings steve back the other way
dont ever stop
it wasnt supposed to be like this
darren starts off the rafter toward him
one last look of hate
and hes gone
disappearing into the dark
darren joins debbie
nothing left to hide
darren shakes his head
sam didnt make it
darren looks at crepsley
hes a mess
are you gonna be okay
i just need to catch my breath
for a few days
maybe a week
you think i made a mistake dont you
i think that you proved yourself human after all
as darren absorbs this kindness smiles
what do you mean
theres a war on isnt there
this world is crossed by fences
you have to decide which side you stand on
black and white fences crossing very gray fields
its not gray
ive met the bad guys
they need to be stopped
im not sure its my fight
but you said it
theres no in between
and the power of being alone is never going to be greater than the weakness
its our fight
as patrons try to get as far as they can as quick as they can
we see steve duck out blending in
tinys lincoln continental pulls up
as steve gets in
tall evra debbie darren and crepsley
crepsley sets sams body down in the grass
its covered with one of madam truskas tent silks
as crepsleys eyes meet darrens
he was a good kid
its weird but i remember things about him even though i wasnt there when they happened
even though its impossible
a moment as crepsley nods sadly at this most singular boy
his blood is in you
ill deal with the police when they come
what ill say i dont know
say what happened
some crazy guy showed up
sam was in the wrong place at the wrong time
theyre all quiet a moment
he was brave
for the only time in his life
he didnt die in vain
time to fly or flit or whatever you call it
the sun wont wait all night
actually thats exactly what it does
tall manages a smile considers the sky a moment
time will tell what this night has brought us
keep my coffin ready would you
as they exchange farewells debbie turns to darren
do you think well meet again
you never know
as she hugs him tight she whispers in his ear i hope so
hope is a good word
i hope so too
and so goodbye
darren and crepsley start down the road
where are we going
to meet the vampire generals
war clouds are forming
a storm is coming
and i have a feeling youre needed much more than i am
so what are we waiting for
crepsley offers his hand
take my arm
darren shakes his head doesnt need it
he shimmers flits into the night
crepsley laughs to himself
as he follows
