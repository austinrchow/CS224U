written by peter berg james vanderbilt february the desert
afghanistan three years ago we hear faint screams
a man begging
theres no way
sand dunes stretch to the horizon
nowhere to run
a shadow falls across the sand
then a second
one looks like a dogs head
the other like
hand puppet shadows
laughter from other men
godzilla pursues dog head catches him and begins humping him
you the best
me love you long time
cmon jensen you in or not
whip pan to the puppeteer and freeze frame on jensen
s lennon glasses wild blonde hair shirt open
bald eagle tattoo on his chest
resume speed and get cheated again
whip pan to and freeze frame on pooch
mid s black and solid
eagle tattoo on right bicep his nine month old daughters face tattooed on his left
currently mock offended
resume speed the pooch dont cheat
the pooch may lie the pooch may steal
the pooch may refer to himself in the third person but the pooch will not cheat
the pooch can rest easy i was referring to cougar
whip pan and freeze frame on cougar
tan camo cowboy hat pulled low over his eyes long hair
sniper rock god
he doesnt say or move much
aint no rattling him
resume speed its liars poker jensen how in the hell is the man gonna cheat you at liars poker
whip pan as he asks the question and freeze frame on roque
close cropped black hair
if lance armstrong bred with darth vader
doesnt smile much but hes smiling now
the four are in open air the guys sit in the back
in the middle of the desert with nothing to do but wait
roque holds the deck
the four take them
lick the back slap them to their foreheads two deuces jensen and roque a three pooch and an eight cougar
got a feeling about this one roque
your mama had that feeling too
at which point jensen pulls a knife
and tosses it into the center of the circle
roque responds by tossing a
magnum from his belt in
that the one with the hollow points
oh shit im definitely in then
he puts in a desert eagle
jensen pulls a second meaner looking knife
this even me up
exactly how many knives do you have anyway
jensen grins and stabs it down into the pot
cougar your bet
the silent man stares at the others
two deuces and a three
he shakes his head at them
before he can bet
whip pan to clay
their leader and you gotta be a bad ass to lead this crew
a weariness to him already
and hands faster than you can imagine
ripping across the desert
pooch drives clay shotgun others in the back
passing a computer tablet to jensen
authenticate and backtrace
send us out to the middle of nowhere to wait for instructions
were good this baby came out of the kandahar spook station controllers codename is max
he hands the tablet back
this is an agency gig
we dont get to pick what needs to be done
reading from tablet quaeda wannabe name of fadhil is running a terrorist assembly line out around the khyber pass im shocked
shocked i say
we find it we paint it for a laser targeted bomb
no muss no fuss
for that we had to put on a blindfold and turn around three times
youd rather take on fifty mujas with aks
he upshifts a gear as the humvee drives on
a terrorist looking fellow talks with another
our guys now in full on black ops special forces combat desert fatigues perched high above what looks like a run down afghan prison
roque with the field glasses i got eyes on fadhil
pooch fires up the laser designator and aims it at the compound
a high pitched whine as he does
call me michelangelo
cougar sights down the laser scope of his long rifle
just taking in the scenery
jensen into a field radio dropkick this is pinball confirmed eyes on target is designated
a desert hawk roars through the sky enroute to target
roger target acquired exfil chopper is enroute
eta to fireworks is eight minutes
roger well break out the earplugs
to the others so who wants to get a game
we got eight minutes and then for the first time cougar speaks
with concern boss
clay immediately looks through his scope
a group of child slaves on the ground by the prison being led off a truck
the others look too
reacting call it in
dropkick children are at target site repeat we have eyes on children at target site advise
hold the line
seconds tick by
acknowledged maintain position
colonel dropkick we strongly recommend cancellation of payload delivery abort order can only come from clay grabs the radio from jensen mission controller is agency codename max repeat codename max
so get him on the horn and already have pinball your orders stand
prep for exfil
the others stare at clay
cougar takes the butt of his rifle and smashes the laser designator to bits
clay into the radio
dropkick this is pinball targeting equipment has suffered system failure am calling an abort
then a different voice well that was stupid
the voice is even
who is this
this is a secure very stupid colonel
clay blinks no one uses names on comms
there are children on site and you think i didnt know that
not the sharpest of knives in the drawer are you
we locked coordinates the moment you painted delivery will occur on schedule
clay hits the send button to respond gets a squelch
cursing tossing the radio to jensen shit
jensen call the general at the firebase get him to abort cant theyre jamming us then contact the plane directly trying all channels negative were screwed
theres nothing we can do
his face stricken
they all are
and then theres something we can do
clay hefts his rifle
the others stare at him
automatically begin checking their own weapons
roque runs it down for them five against a fortress and weve got maybe six minutes before an airstrike sets the world on fire
so ill drive
bad guys firing wildly as our guys humvee plows through the gate
i guess were going with the fifty mujas with aks option after all
a series of shots we see just how good these guys are
cougar on his knee in the back snipes single shot kills takes out seven men
roque pulls to a halt in the center of the compound bad guys coming out of the woodwork with automatic weapons
as the guys hop out pooch and jensen get a truck for the kids the rest of us will be out in five airstrikes in four and change out in
clay leads zone coverage toward the building roque and cougar run middle quick death strikes
images blast fast and savage as these men kill their way into the fort
roque calmly kicks in the door kills five men sitting around a table with two young girls in the middle the terrified girls run to him
the bad guys have no chance fast
our crew takes the fort
moving through a tight hallway they find the children locked in a large empty room
they start leading them out
one little boy stops clay
in pashtun clay checks the time
minutes to airstrike
to roque and cougar get em out
roque and cougar hustle the kids toward the exit while clay moves downstairs into the darker sublevels
clay kicks in a door to find a man looming over a shackled boy
unbuckling his pants
the man pales
realizing the american understands what he was about to do backing away begging in pashtun omar doesnt move
instead he eerily raises his hand and wordlessly points to a cell
in the corner
and clay hears a moan emit from it
omar lowers his arm
goes upstairs dragging his bear
approaches the cell
looks down into it
its clear from clays face that its something horrific
max sent you
how do you know that name
was ia field ops hunting rogue agents
max caught me
he torture rasps and spits small chunks of death
max is rogue
something horrific leans forward out of the shadows
youre off mission arent you
clay just stares
whats the mission
max doesnt care about fadhil
hes cleaning up the mess
youre his mop
im the mission
clays just staring into the burning crazed eyes of something horrific
i can get you out
kill me blam
a bullet pierces what used to be left of something horrifics chest
not fired by clay
and he dies
clay turns cougar
lowers his rifle
speaks one word
holds up his watch
speaks another run
clay and cougar burst from the fort firing and running full tilt towards the commandeered truck loaded with kids
as they leap into the back pooch hits the gas jesus you stop for coffee in there
as he runs over two bad guys trying to stop them at the gate
the sound of a jet approaching
roque to jensen what kind of blast radius we looking at
jensen calculating on the computer tablet
shows an animation mock up to roque huge blast radius
to pooch the fort and the retreating truck below us mere specks as the desert hawk swoops in and releases its payload
a moment of silence as it falls
and then strikes below an orange fireball ballooning outwards
ripping across the dunes fireball expanding behind them
i think were in the clear as the fireball engulfs them
in the middle of the firestorm all pooch can see is flames through the windshield as they plow through the destruction
glances in the rear view uh coug
cougars sleeve fully ablaze
he casually rips it off and tosses it out the back
through the windshield the fire clears
to reveal a foot drop
the guys scream as they plunge over it
the truck buries itself nose first in the sand
smoke rises from a crater that was once the fort
the doors of the truck creak open
most of the youngsters giggle
as the guys help them out yeah that was great wasnt it
my favorite part was when we were completely on fire
what was yours
sounds of a blackhawk chopper approaching
how are we gonna explain the kids colonel
clay doesnt seem to hear him
clay looks up the kids
what do we tell em
clay seems to shake off his daze as the blackhawk sets down
walking up to the chopper lieutenant youre to evac these civvies to the firebase immediately negative our orders are to transport a five man team only
clays eyes dart down to the pilots neck
a silver crucifix hangs around it
clay softer you really want to leave twenty three kids in the desert to die
not enough room for them and you
then its them
the pilot nods
our guys begin loading the kids on
clay helps omar on last
the kid looks at him
he knows perfectly well what clay saved him from in that basement
the pilot pulls the stick back and the chopper ascends
the kids wave goodbye to our guys
omar holding clays gaze as they rise
only broken as the chopper begins to recede into the distance
the last clay sees of him is that ratty little teddy bear
cute little buggers
hope they can make it to our court martial
relax pooch were not going to be court martialed if anything were going to die of thirst wandering the desert right colonel
jensen see if you can cut into that blackhawks chatter i want to know if he rats us out
as jensen tunes his radio
so how we getting back
i say magic carpet
guess they hustled up some air support after all thats a pakistani mig up there
jensens tuning into the migs frequency
this is bad
max cobra one
bandit locked twelve oclock low
their eyes go wide with understanding
understood cobra one
clay and cougar have already begun running towards the receding chopper on the horizon
as the mig swings in fox one
the mig fires air to air missile
the blackhawks tail rotor sheared off the chopper spinning and falling but still intact
pooch the pilot from somewhere screaming auto rotate go with it you can still put her down if you and again
the second missile from the mig slams into the blackhawk proper
clay and cougar screaming by the time they reach the wreck
omars teddy bear blackening to a crisp
clay tries to dive into the flames but cougar drags him back
no use anyway
nothings alive inside
a safe house
a large man stands in the shadows watching as roque jensen pooch cougar and clay yell back and forth at fennel a cia handler what are you talking about max
he set up the operation there was no operation
you were never radioed orders
i talked to him
you kill a friendly afghan warlord probably lose us the support of half the tribes in the region and your alibi is max
wait are you saying youre max
colonel max is an agency code for a rogue agent or operation what are you talking there is no specific max
the large man finally steps out of the shadows
special forces like our guys
they know him
max is catch all for exactly what youve been accused of
terminologys been around since the s
silence as the guys take this in
we didnt kill those kids wade
wade studies him
finally i believe you
well be back
they watch wade and fennel leave
after a bit pooch looks down
under a little table
wade left his suitcase
it hits them all at the same time
they bolt for the door
run to the window
three floors up and it has bars on it
nodding to the case jensen
im not good with bombs man i dont care roque pooch get those bars off
roque and pooch swiss army knives out
phillips head attachments slotting them into the screws that hold the barred window frame in place
jensen pops open the briefcase
wires and dials aplenty
first set of screws out moving onto the second
its a remote detonator enough for them to get clear maybe ten i told you im not good with bombs
how are those bars coming
second set out moving onto the third and final
third set out ripping the frame from the window
wide on the city block as the safe house explodes
debris flying far enough to shower the open air bazaar being held two blocks east
hold on the smoldering ruins
a rain slicked tarmac
marines carrying five flag draped coffins off a troop transport carrier
our guys families watching
poochs wife and daughters
tears in their eyes
our guys personnel folders
each being opened
each being stamped deceased
as the marines salute the passing coffins
poochs wife lowers her head weeping
cut to a nice quiet neighborhood
white picket fences the whole nine
were watching from outside the kitchen window of a cape cod two story
poochs wife jolene doing dishes
springfield massachusetts now
she dries her hands and heads upstairs
we catch a glimpse of her in the upstairs hall
then in her daughters bedroom
years old now
mom putting her down
in the backyard by the swingset a figure watches
indulging in a nightly ritual
day of the dead
jesters and masks
a man with a cowboy hat walks among them
sees mexican police eyeing him
walks a little faster
hat pulled low as fireworks explode above
a late night internet cafe wedged between a donut shop and spinning studio
playing interactive on line combat
dogs in full sprint
a few thousand spectators
not the derby but reasonably enthused
in the cheap seats clay and roque
three years older
but in no way bolder
they look almost
roques got his feet up
sucks lazily on a straw embedded in what looks like a soda pop
clays got binoculars following the action on the track muscle shredded greyhounds tearing over the dirt
one crosses the finish line
roque checks their ticket
you lost again
we lost again
clays got the binoculars up slow checking the track
you placed the bet
you gave me the money
well that was stupid of me wasnt it
clay drums his fingers along the binocs as he scans
we see on his right hand between his thumb and index finger a tattoo
a teddy bear
looks just like omars
that makes what three in a row
something glint flashes
catches clays eye
he looks across the track towards the parking lot
you know where youre messing up
youre putting all our money on the dogs with the best odds
yeah ive just gone crazy with that approach
clay scans the lot a young woman in tight jeans walks towards a black pick up carrying a pair of binoculars
never play a longshot youre never gonna win
clay doesnt respond
were at a dogtrack at a
could this get any more sleazy
maybe if we were drinking
roque takes a pull on his straw
youre not drinking
clay and roque wolf big macs in a chevy crew cab
families eat outside
kids play like hamsters in tubes
well stay two more days try to get some of the cash back
various people walk to and from their cars
clay and roque shield their faces from them instinctually
i cant take much more of this
were on the run
it occasionally im serious
grinding out lunch money on five dollar sports bets wincing everytime some overly aqua netted cow stares at my face for more than two seconds im at the point where
im thinking we ought to try to reach out to the company
all we did was say the word max and they blew up a building
cia even gets a whiff of where were at theyll call in an airstrike
shakes his head until we figure out how we can take max down and get clear we lay low
a metro dade police cruiser rolls into the mcdonalds
clay watches close as it pulls into a parking spot
due respect youre nobodys colonel anymore
anytime you want to move along you go right ahead
like the others
least i still talk to them
you pushed them away
max this max that we never even saw the guy clay we heard his voice
guy with a voice is a guy with a throat
and if hes got a throat
were hiding out in the parking lot of a goddamn mcdonalds you actually think were in any position to take on some shadowy cia super spook
no its a stellar plan we can use this as our base of ops
gestures to the pooch can run the motor pool out of the ball pit and jensen can set up communications by the slide
clay seeing one of the cops say something to the other
roque fires up the engine as the cops get out of the cruiser
pulling smoothly into the street
roque pulls up to their shitbeater motel
tension still between them
he gets out turning back to his friend i was there too
but he won
maybe its time for a new game
with that roque heads to the motel
clay looks down at his quarter eaten burger
he needs some real food
clay at the bar eating a steak and drinking alone
honky tonk on the juke mix of sawdust and blood on the floor
a young woman enters shes hot feels familiar
clay eyes her as she orders a drink dodges several guys
yabba dabba doo
she catches clays eye
rolls her eyes
clays paying more attention to his t bone than the girl
she slides up next to him
her names aisha
clay turns back to his food
not used to attractive women instigating conversation
aisha watches as clay eats
hows the steak
shes still watching him
its getting annoying
want a bite
i dont eat red meat
slows me down
aisha studies clay
if weve been paying close attention we might id her as the race track binocular chick
were not sure if clay does
you got nice arms
turning to her i know you
i like arms
do i not look relaxed
think we can change that
clay and aisha enter his motel room
aisha checks out the sparse accommodations
wow its everything a girl could dream of
got a bathroom
no i specifically requested the only hotel room in the world that doesnt have a bathroom
you lookin to turn a yes into a no here
clay points to the bathroom
aisha checks herself in the mirror
a touch of lip gloss
so what brings you to florida
clay in the bedroom
leans over stretching his hamstrings
does a few subtle twists loosening up
convention for what
clay looks around
weakly air conditioners
in the bathroom aisha studies herself in the mirror
stretching her arms prepping for some physical activity
they have whole conventions devoted to air conditioners
youd be surprised
aisha comes back out
both now stretched and loose
bet i would
where were we
they study each other
aisha slowly moves towards clay
you were about to tell me how much you enjoy spending time at the dog track
aisha smiles tracing her fingers down his stomach
saw me there did you
clay strokes her cheek
didnt see me at the mcdonalds though
their lips inches from touching
i have a proposition for you
clay decks her
she reels back loaded glock up and out and clay ducks left backhands her with his forearm sends her flying across the room pause
both breathing hard
staring at one another just hear me out
i dont want to hurt you
youre not going to
yes i am
he foot plants spins re attacks and it is on
insanely viscous tearing the room to utter shreds
a face kick plaster smashes
she hurls a twenty six inch color television at him
this explodes against a wall
sparks give to flame as the room starts to burn hot around these two warriors
they continue to fight like rabid wolves
and theyre grinning
then freeze aisha on top of clay each has a buck knife up and tight against the others throat
blades on skin
flames around them rooms on fire
what do you want
clay spits blood and sucks air
you want to clarify that
i can help you
this clearly has effect on clay substantial effect
clay stares up at aisha
flames all around them
clay and aisha walk away from the burning motel
howd you find me
its not too tough if you know where to look
you guys arent exactly subtle
a fire engine screams past them towards the burning hotel as if to illustrate her point
howd you know i was alive
counted the number of teeth found in the safehouse debris in karachi
not nearly enough for five men
who else knows
that youre alive
so whats to stop me from putting a bullet in your head
you want max and i can tell you how to get him
max is up to something big isnt he
agency wouldnt have sent you otherwise
she gives a little smile
nice try but im working alone here
if i wasnt i wouldnt need your help
ready for the important part
there is a plane
this plane contains a truck
this truck contains a cargo
this cargo is very important
is this a riddle
this cargo belongs to max
you steal the cargo max comes looking for it you grab max
what a brilliant plan and oh so simple too
whats the cargo
aisha just smiles
so you want me to steal some super secret cargo known only to you and the bad guy and im supposed to do this because you know the name max
and look good in a pair of jeans
begins walking away
she calls out after him
he turns back you really think i look good in these jeans
max uses it to fund his off the books ops
and it comes straight from the poppy fields of the late jamal al fadhil
knowing full well oh
does that name mean something to you
a beat as clay stares at her realizing
he used you to kill fadhil and take over his operation thats right
what did you think you were doing there in the first place
fighting for truth and justice
clay stares at her
how do i know i can trust you
check my background
im an ex company hitter
first job was a junior field officer in shanghai
you can google it under shanghai hilton decapitation
i mostly google porn
two chinese and an italian arms dealer in bangkok
with my hands
then i stopped auditioning for you
this is a check for ten grand he holds up his hand
were not mercenaries
operational capital thats all
holding out the check youve been waiting three years for a shot at this guy
youre not gonna get another
you want max this is it
he takes it
she hands him some papers along with it
intel on the shipment
you check it out you check me out you decide are you in or not
cougar chilling by a small fire
working his way through a bottle of tequila
his blackberry rings
pooch in a motel laying in bed alone watching an old jimmy stewart movie
jensens in bed with two girls from his spin class
the city midday is utterly packed
the capital of the next great superpower
a top floor office suite of a high end technology company
degrees on the walls
a bollywood musical blares from a tv loud enough to cover up the sounds of begging
three indian scientists a short guy a tall guy and a really fat guy on the floor bound terrified looking up at a tough looking bastard standing over them wade
our burly man from the safe house
now he works for the suit in the brown french club chair
the big man master of disaster trouble on a firestick
you know we cannot do this
we cannot do what you ask
tell me is this a moral issue or a financial issue
a moral issue
you object morally to this deal
max takes a moment
okay heres what im hearing
im hearing no
im hearing leave and im hearing im sorry
is that what im hearing
you must leave
max nods to himself
he thought so
okay so that is what im hearing
now i want you to listen
listen carefully because i want you to hear this
wade hauls him up the fat scientist
without hesitation he walks him over to the large glass window looking down fifty three stories above delhi and hurls him out
exploding through the glass
as the poor bastard falls and screams
the other scientists scream at the sight
max turns to wade bewildered what the hell was that
you gave me the nod
a hit him in the face nod not a throw him out the window nod
i thought thats what you wanted
at most at most that was a break his fingers nod
slams his fist i mean jesus wade the man was scientific genius
granted his weight signaled that he had certain impulse control issues but thats no reason to throw his fat ass out a fifty story window
as if to a child i think i speak for everyone here when i say that your actions were excessive and yes more than just a little wasteful
max looks over at the cowering scientists
then again it seemed to have had the desired effect toss short round out next
wade starts for the short scientist
we have a different moral perspective than our late colleague
the hell you say
i need one to test and one to use
one to test
of course one to test you think i trust you
we will need much money
you will have much money
max and wade are up and out
max and wade striding towards the elevators
passing cubicles that indian workers cower under we realize maxs heavily armed henchmen had seized the entire floor
call our people at goliath tell them well have a special package arriving on the th
he snaps his fingers and the henchman follow
a non descript warehouse among many
so this is what your girl came up with huh
large and empty
clay and roque take a look around it
better than a ball pit
you sure youre thinking clear on this
off clays look i know you
when you slip its always cause of a woman
name one time that carla
carla wasnt the problem carlas husband was the problem carlas husband wasnt the one who okay
she shot me
but only in the leg
what about emma
emma doesnt count we never slept together
because she put a bomb in your car
i admit that took some of the romance out of the relationship
and now this chick first time you meet her burns down our hotel
also she kills people for a living
these are not good signs
im clear roque
roque studies clay long and hard
you better be
or were done
interrupted as a door creaks open clay and roque immediately have their pistols out facing down an entering damn
we missed you too
cougar is with him
clay and roque lowers their weapons and go to embrace them
pooch bear hugs roque
cougar nods to clay
so whats this i hear about clay gettin us killed over a girl
from the shadows been a long time since anyone called me a girl
the guys start as she emerges
ten outta ten for stealth and shit but next time could you just knock
how long you been back there
she put a bomb in your car
she was volatile
aisha meet pooch roque and cougar
a beat as she takes this motley bunch in
you cant hang out with anyone just named phil
another creak jensen enters
hail hail the gangs all here
im gonna need a moment alone with the boys if you dont mind but id like to reserve the right to awkwardly hit on you later
id expect no less
the guys admire her form as she leaves
when shes gone what do you have on her
besides a pants busting crush
her intel checks out
the cargo will be arriving here in two days
wow i completely trust her now
grew up in afghanistan mom was a local dad was white devil
oh and cias got a kill order out on her
as does hamas sien fein mosaad pretty much everyone with the exception of peta wants this chick amscrayed
last cia email flagged with her name says she was digging for information about a special project
looks up at them codename max
a moment as this sinks in
they want to wet her cause shes lookin into max
that sounds familiar
could those files finishing his question have been planted for us to find
shaking his head cia timestamp digital watermark
someone wouldve had to go to a lot of trouble and i mean a lot to fool me
looks to the others
i say we go with her
pooch nodding im in
cougar nods his assent
only one left
they all turn to him
jensen smacks his fist on the table excited hot damn
back with the colonel doing another bid for god and country turned her back on us and god can screw
this ones for us
and anyone who calls me colonel better be ready to take a beating or an order
we aint soldiers anymore
so whats the plan my civilian brothers
we start tomorrow
were going bird hunting
a white bell ab chopper glides into frame flying over a small series of white sanded jungle islands
it used to be so simple
a post world
howler monkeys taunt scream up as the chopper slow circles over the beautiful deserted island
outer fijian islands
as a country we spoke with one voice moved with one purpose
we had a wicked boner for doing the right thing and now look at us
max wearing a hawaiian shirt and raybans
zinc on his nose rubbing suntan lotion on his forearms
to wade percent of the globe is tooling up to whack us and were too busy losing our nerve to notice
its us versus them and right now my money would be on them
camera dropping fast out of the chopper soaring down low tracking with a howler monkey up a palm tree then airborne as the monkey leaps twenty feet to another
wasnt it thomas jefferson who once said the tree of freedom must be watered with etcetera etcetera
we need to wake people up wade
we need to hit them in the face angry up the blood give them their balls back
we track with our lead monkey up to something very un monkey like
a metallic trunk like object
flashing lights and transponder devices
we need to give them a ten megaton reality check
ala john lee hooker boom boom boom boom
a half millisecond breath
then utter destruction
a multi staged nuclear shred blast trees earth water are sucked in then hurled outwards in a series of shock waves and fire balls
tsunamis erupt as the chopper shudders from the blast
when the mushroom cloud clears
stunned silence in the chopper
then max whoops like a year old whos just seen the worlds best fireworks show
i think its safe to say it works
wade not quite as enthused
his face falls
jeez talk about hard to impress
max and wade stepping off the chopper as it powers down
max walks towards his office
wade calling after him the companys with you on this
wade raises an eyebrow
you know the drill they dont like to know how the sausages get made
what do you care
just want to make sure everyone gets paid
the moneys coming from our afghanistan operation
and what the company doesnt know wont hurt them
unless theyre within the blast radius
max puts his hand on wades shoulder
were gonna saving our country wade
the united states of america will benefit greatly from what were doing
i was born in quebec
jesus fine were saving north america does that make you happy
just get it done
max stalks away
a us army humvee tears past camera just missing a couple of freaked out jack rabbits blast hopping for their lives
on perimeter patrol at mph down an endless desert road
base one this is cavalier
sector eight perimeter clear proceeding to sector nine
his fingers rapid tap worn keys
into radio drawls roger that cav we have a report of a civilian vehicle breakdown on u
sector nine grid four
please assist as required
four patrol soldiers
the driver throws a hard right
army of one my ass
goddamn triple a service
a kenworth heavy pulled off to the side
pooch works on the front right tire
sweating buckets in the desert bake
the humvee approaches
two soldiers get out
need a hand buddy
pooch looks up from his tire
fifty feet off the road
a brown blanket slowly rising
reveal the long black barrel of a sniper rifle
scope pov colors and graphics weve never seen before
cougars got his own thing going on
more jerry garcia than tom clancy
soldier ones throat is smack dab in the middle of it
close on cougars trigger finger slight squeeze
soldier one slaps at the burning sting in his neck
something just bit me
he pulls a two inch tranq dart off his neck
staring at the dart is this
the three other soldiers see the dart and leap out when
from behind the truck roque rises arms out
wedged in each hand twin jet black
caliber colt stun pistols
the soldiers stagger twist and stumble before succumbing to the demerol
the sound of heavy iron releasing as the walls start to separate revealing we are inside the broken down truck
make the call
jensen taps into the military emergency band
takes a breath centers himself then
base one this is cavalier
we have been in a collision with a civilian vehicle
carveys dead an freemans hurt bad
hes messed up his neck
he cant move
oh god its horrible
we need medevac immediate
hes got kids base roger cavalier
were scrambling a chopper hang in there
jensen all smiles looks up at clay
robert de niro who
pooch and roque have the four drugged soldiers laid out on the sand
all four are clearly breathing
sleeping like babies
what about their ride
clay steps off the trailer with a heavy duty air hoist
tight shots of the air ram attached to the undercarriage of the humvee
the tires start to lift off the ground
four pairs of hands start rocking the truck
pooch and jensen on one side
quietly what do you thinks up with that dont call me colonel stuff
classic loss of identity
clay defined himself by his place in the military structure
it was his way of measuring the good he did in the world
without it hes just another loser like the rest of us
pooch blinks impressed
then you know theres a website where you can download mp s of donkeys farting
how cool is that
a final push
and the humvee flips
from jensens radio cavalier this is medevac delta
be advised we are airborne and in bound to your position
all right everyone get into character
jensen and roque lie on the ground by the flipped humvee
lot of work to bum a ride
shut up jensen
you shut up roque
youre dead im the spinal injury spinal injury can talk dead cant
stop talking or ill break your neck for real
seriously you have to get more into your role
clay leans against the truck
in the distance the faint outline of a massive double rotor troop transport chopper
here we go
behind the pilot as he moves in on the accident scene
base one this is medevac delta
we have visual on cavalier
clay waves the chopper in
it lands on the road
two emts leap out and race towards the fallen soldiers
the first emt kneels by jensen
alright buddy were gonna get you patched up in no time
y you ever treat anyone whod been gut shot
sure in iraq
what a mess
jensen pulls his colt presses it up into the emts gut
means you know whats coming to you if try to play hero
now lose the radio mic bones
the two pilots wait behind full reflective face shields what are they jawing about out there
were burning fuel clack clack
the pilots turn as two machine guns jam up on them from out of the darkness
pooch and cougar
you heard of car jacked
youve just been chopper jacked my man
youre robbing the us army
the pilots slump
pooch to cougar when he says it out loud it does sound kinda ridiculous
clay pops his head in wheres my wild goose
pooch reaches in and rips the choppers transponder off
the chopper now under a tarp on the back of the truck trailer
the transponder strapped to a small rocket
were all set here
ready to take a giant step for
well for guys who steal stuff i guess
jensen fires the rocket
the transponder takes off
let em chase that
medevac delta this is base one
whats your situation over
pooch gets up behind the wheel
time to move
the team gets into the big double cab
pooch fires up the engine and the heave rig tears out onto the highway
after theyre gone on one of the drugged soldiers
trying to sit up
he looks around
wide seven soldiers out cold on the side of the road
our guys are prepping
pooch and clay check out maps
cougar in full face mask spray paints something big
no what you want is a gas turbine generator running a force fed rectifier unit hook it up to the fuel tank
aisha sits watching in silence
jensen approaches her
so you grew up in the hindu kush huh
that mustve been rough
watching the chopper uh huh
got any hobbies
aisha never taking her eyes off the chopper when i was a girl i collected human ears
i had over three dozen pairs when a feral dog came into our camp one night and took them
the dog was good eating though
im gonna go somewhere else now
aisha stands walking over to the chopper
are small arms gonna be a problem
clay and pooch look at the new girl
its taken care of we lined the hull with half inch steel plate
roque steps forward
which brings us to our next question
he pulls a desert eagle and levels it at aishas skull
whats your angle in this
aisha just smiles
clay more annoyed than worried roque
im giving you a chance to get even
thats all you need to know
roque stares at aisha
neither backing down
im gonna shoot her clay
no youre not
yes i am
he thumbs back the hammer
a tense moment
and then roque lowers the gun
shes coming with us
and if anything feels like a set up i put a bullet in her skull
now if youll excuse me its time for prayers
you know you are a sharp one and dont let any of these other boys tell you different
with that she turns and walks away into the shadows
roque lowers the weapon
to clay i dont like this
i picked up on that
im with roque man
agency thinks were dead
we show up alive and kickin start waving our dicks around in public theyre gonna make it their business to bury us
theyll call us terrorists all what do you think we are now
to all of them best case scenario this gets us face to face with max what if it doesnt
what if we never get face to face with him
are you gonna be able to live with that
clay doesnt reply
a pall cast over the guys
finally hell lets just say it out loud
we do this were declaring war on the central intelligence agency
silence as the guys take this in
then from the corner
they started it
swooping down over the waterways threading our way between buildings past the islands slamming into a g tire chalked
a fork lift removes a large vault like package from the back of the plane the cargo
a fifteen ton attack stabilized cash transport rig idles surrounded by twenty assault troopers loading up
machine guns frag grenades body armor
by the jet wade and fennel our briefcase bomb friends talks with a g
gordon liddy wrinkle muscleman
as of this moment the truck is designated an extraterritorial zone of immunity
under no circumstances whatsoever are you or your men to allow the package to leave the truck before its secure in the compound to do so would be considered an
act of treason and punishable as such
understood and acknowledged sir
as the package is loaded into the monster armored rig
ten men ride with the package and another ten ride chase
ten rock hard warriors in a beefed up chase van
the two truck armored convoy pulls out of the private airport and passes a parked town car
clay roque and jensen watch the armored trucks pass by
roque has a silenced long gun out as the second truck passes
as roque pulls the trigger
a silenced air blast we travel fast with roques ordinance smacking silent onto the rear bumper of the lead truck
a ballistic putty coated recon tracker
jensens laptop gps goes hot
green dot indicates convoy
are we wired
target is westbound
heading for the bridge
clay fires up the town car and follows
aerial looking down as the armored cars head towards the city
tilt up to reveal the crescent city connection eight suspended lanes spanning the mighty mississippi
high angle looking down at the bridge traffic
sliding into frame buckle harnessed and very armed two hundred feet above ground
lashed into a bridge support
he racks the bolt of his ntw anti material rifle a monster of a weapon with a bulky starlight scope
as the first swat truck reaches the center of the bridge take em
cougar fires and everything begins happening very fast
the swat trucks nearside front wheel explodes blown clear off the axle mount the wheel spins away bounces wild smashes a windshield the driver wrestling with the wheel
shit im losing it
the truck slews sideways plows into a car
the driver slams the truck in reverse floors it cougar fires again the other front wheel detonates and the trucks nose slams down on the asphalt grinding sparks
going nowhere fast
screeches to a hard stop behind
security crew out weapons raised taking up defensive positions
ice cold professionals
form a defensive perimeter around the truck
theyre out of their minds theres no way off this bridge
now at the entrance to the bridge
roque smiles as he hefts an mgl grenade launcher
thick tear gas explodes in dark blues billowing across traffic
security men choke lost in the smoke
secure the package
where are they
i cant see them
cougar pumps a round into the empty chase van armor glass blasting apart showering the roadway fennel dives for cover panicking lifts the radio to his lips code red
we are under attack
need chopper support right now
roque fires another tear gas grenade into the melee civilians running and screaming total pandemonium acknowledged evac is enroute
as the chase van is blown apart behind them
fennel trying to orient through smoke and gas
then a new sound
thick bass vibrations
the thick tear gas being blown aside by the thunderous twin rotor downwash of a chinook heavy lift chopper
it bellies in low the boarding ramp already lowering
wade crouch runs to the swat truck hammering the rear cavalrys here
the doors burst open and the swat team crash rolls the precious cargo crate towards the chinooks boarding ramp move
swat guys laying down point cover as their comrades hustle the crate into the chinooks windowless hold
the ramp rising as fennel dives onboard as well
wade makes a take off sign to the chinook pilot who flips him a salute as the chinook lifts into the air
the ramp closing
the team and cargo safely aboard
passing cougars sniper harness which now hangs empty
twisting in the wind
as we hear the rotors fade into the distance
wade slumps against the burnt out wreckage of the chase van
sighing in relief
his radio crackles this is chopper support we are inbound your position eta five minutes
hang in there
as a horrified look of realization crosses wades face and he stares up into the sky
the swat guys pull off their masks and high five
they think they kicked ass
fennel reaching for the cockpit door handle
he cant turn it
what the hell
its welded shut
the windows too
were sealed in
we hear the faint yelling of fennel and the swat guys in the hold
the chinook pilot flips up his goggles to reveal its pooch
aisha sitting co pilot
both grinning as they hear the protestations from behind them
the middle of nowhere
a small clearing
skeeters and crickets harmonize
clay waits with jensen and roque
the chinook crests the tree line
fennel and the swat guys try to maintain balance and personal dignity as they stumble and fall all over each other
the chopper sets down
the men gather themselves
checking clips safeties off
were down okay
you go the second the ramp lowers
hit them hard three round bursts center mass
aisha clambers onto the chinooks hull clutching a rubber hose
screws the end to an inlet valve marked fire retardant system
looks down at clay
with a grin open the valve
tight on a inch turn valve
hard hands grab and open
these guys are about to get the surprise of their lives
cut off as a clear liquid begins to rain down on them from the sprinkler system
what the hell they trying to do drown us
sir that smell
their eyes go wide
the ramp lowers
the gas drenched soldiers burst out weapons up
squinting through the fumes
clay stands alone
the men fan out around him
multiple rifles trained at his head from every direction
fennel blinks surprised to see him alive
eat the ground or they blow your head off
i dont think so
first and only warning clay
clay calmly lights a cigarette
tight on the burning cherry the soldiers wide eyed
think about it
as that sinks in fennel looks like his puppy just died
gasoline drips from the muzzle of his own tooled up h k g assault rifle
clay takes a long smooth drag
thingsll kill you
and then the fight just goes out of the swat team
they drop their guns and raise their hands
now lets see what kind of cargo you got in there
clay no bullshit you open that box and we all die
clay steps up to him
near nose to nose
im already dead remember
clays fist to fennels jaw
knocking him cold
tight on fennel as he and the team sit bound and gagged in the back of the chinook
as the ramp rises he shoots panicked glances to clay
the ramp closes between them
clay turns back to
the crate on the ground in front of our guys
pooch and cougar hydro pop the locks
open to reveal an interior crate
smaller polished steel
a ten digit numeric keypad on top and a logo stamped on the side goliath
goliath the oil company
clay looks to aisha
it must be how he moves the drugs
the super evil bad guy is in bed with the worlds largest oil company
thats just fabulous
pooch hefts a tire iron
smacking it into his palm
you want me to go ask fennel the combination
nah i can bypass no problem
he jacks his laptop into the keypad
a few keystrokes and hisssssss
ten million dollars of horse comin up
the second crate opens
revealing a thermo nuclear warhead
our guys stand there
the timer display blinks on and begins counting back
jensen youre up
still in shock
but im not good with bombs
thats a nuke
who makes nukes
department of defense
i gotta hack the it would really be good if you didnt talk right now get that casing off for me
pooch staring at the warhead warily
what if that sets it off
then we die thirty seconds early do it
aisha and pooch with drills pop the screws
lifting the casing off the bomb housing looking down at the i got wires red blue green white yellow okay just hold position
theres also pink hold position
hes typing like the damn wind now images on his laptop flying past as he hacks the d
are you trying to make this more dramatic
his screen frozen
are you kidding me
yes cause this is the time for
i told you im not good at bombs
do you have time to reboot
okay someone pick a color
pull out all the wires
you ever hear of a clock radio that exploded cause you unplugged it pull out all the wires
with no other options pooch does
the clock still going
the end of the wires fizzle
opening it without the code must have triggered the timer
and then roque pulls his gun
levelling it at aisha did you know
i just saved our lives did you know
of course not
clay turns suddenly stalking towards the chinook
where the hell are you fennel
the losers stand around fennel whos been crying
urine stain on his pants
sniveling spilling his guts rapidly max thinks the countrys lost its way gone soft in the war on terror
this is his solution
clay jams a gun to his temple
he wanted us to nuke a u
target pin it on the ragheads and boom freedom is on the march again
the same people who want us to pull back will be screaming to turn the place into a parking lot
what was the target
clay fires inches from fennels head
fennel the mall of america
they stare down at him in disbelief
its his sense of humor
he told us we could choose between there and epcot center
a beat as our guys take this in
holy shit its like we were framed by dr
what about goliath
yeah what would an oil company want with the middle east
the ships that service their offshore oil rigs are exempt from us customs
its how max gets the drugs in and out of the country this is conspiracy theory bullshit its not
maxs heroin operation goliath keeps accounts of the shipments
come on dude theyd be morons to keep records of shit like this its on a stand alone hard drive
its their insurance policy against max they know hes crazy this way they have something on him
so this hard drive it contains evidence of what max has been doing
our guys exchange looks
can you get us this drive
fennel goes even paler
i dont know where it is
they dont let me have access
but fennel goes pale when he sees clay move toward him no wait
please dont kill clay plasters duct tape over fennels mouth
stepping outside the chinook
the others going with him
the warhead still sitting there
nobody speaks for a bit
then i say we hit goliath headquarters
and do what go after this non existent hard drive
we find out if it exists
if it does we steal it and trade it for immunity
roque stares at him
thats your plan
you got a better one
max gives us back our lives or we upload the data to the net show the american people whats being done in their names
why risk our lives again when we already have something to trade
he gestures to the warhead
you want to give it back to him
i want to at least discuss it before signing up for another suicide mission on the say so of some flunky its not happening
roque blinks at clays abruptness
so you want to take down goliath now
you dont want max to pay
i want my life back
this is supposed to be us getting clear not saving the world
were not the goddamn good guys anymore
i love you guys but i had a life before this shit and i sure as hell am not going to risk getting it back because you came down with
a case of the dudley damn do rights
dont raise your voice at me i will raise whatever the hell i want you got a death wish because you got beat by a voice on a radio whap
clay throws a straight right to roques jaw
roque surprised and staggered by the blow
then he smiles through the blood drawing a knife im gonna cut your head off
this got serious quick
pooch steps between them
a really dangerous beat
clay and roque full on eyefucking one another
on aisha she seems to be digging it
broken by i say we hit goliath
she doesnt get a vote staring at roque goliath
roque odd man out
his fingers tighten around the handle of the knife
put it away
a long beat
and roque slides the knife back into its scabbard
clay staring at him
you want your life back youre gonna have to steal it
we hit them in two days
he stalks away
heads the other direction
dontcha hate it when mom and dad fight
cougar grunts in response
so what do we do about the nuke
did i just actually say that
a smile forming
i have an idea
the desk sergeant sips a cup of coffee
doing the sunday crossword
a quiet afternoon
a hub bub outside
holy sarge come quick
the sergeant rises and we follow him through the station towards the front doors
moving faster and more nervously as the noise outside grows
finally stepping out into the street where a crowd has gathered
lookie loos with camcorders
the sergeant pushes through them to find fennel
eyes wide with fear
duct taped to the warhead
a sign hangs around his neck that reads death to america
in big cheery letters and has a smiley face on it
the image of fennel tied to the bomb broadcast on the thai news on a black and white tv
wade squints at it
thats gonna be a quick trial
wonderful guy salt of the earth hell be missed who took my bomb wade
youre not gonna like it
because ive been such a fan of how things have gone up till now
wade shrugs and slides some photos across the table to him
screen grabs from traffic cameras clay roque and jensen in the towncar during the heist
a long beat
who the hell are these people
colonel clay and his unit
you had them killed three years ago
i also had several african nations overthrown three years ago im a the jamal al fadhil situation
okay they need to get dead

because what im going to need you to do is get me a six man fire team ready in twelve hours
you get that right

wade heads for the door
wade turns back
max smiling were gonna need a new bomb
wade waits as four indian men climb out of limo
the first we recognize as one of the scientists that wade did not throw out the window
the other three indian tough guys
the scientist got smart brought some muscle
we appreciate you meeting us in a single story facility
i look at that entire incident as your standard getting to know each other business orientation
now that we know each other know please that if you come near me with any more of that yankee doodle tough guy bullshit you will be fed to my
small smile from wade

wade stares at the scientist
thats going to be difficult
life the way you people want to live it is very difficult mr
you want less difficult move to my country study hinduism
much less difficult
you want to buy atomic bombs
im afraid that is a more difficult way of life
and he smiles
wade drives in a jeep heading back to the city
he wants one billion in cash
intercut with max in the smoked up asian bar
thats a lot of a paper routes
can we swing it
not even close
wont give it to us willingly
you get that six man team together like i asked

sitting on his bed
going over schematics goliath world headquarters
a knock on clays door
he gets up checks the eye hole
i was just going over the plan
she looks at him
you want to go over the plan
she steps into the room towards him
reaching for her lets go over the plan
clay and aisha
looking out at the city
so what really happened to you in afghanistan
clay looks over at her
down at the teddy bear tattoo
and shakes his head
thats not for you
she traces her fingers over it
why do you want max dead
aisha taken aback by the suddenness of the question
hes a bad man
isnt that enough
she looks at him
when you tell me about afghanistan
ill tell you about max
theres lots of sand
aisha smiles at this
shaking her head
why were you alone when i found you
that takes clay off guard
looking out at the city
the guys got sick of it
sick of what
of hearing about max
of hearing me say we had to do something when there wasnt anything to do
they wanted to be around their families
jensen has a sister
pooch has a wife and daughters
and he hasnt told them he is alive
the people you loved the most would you put them in that kind of danger
aisha side stepping the question so roque has no one
hes got me
and you have
enough hate to get us both through the day
he stuck with me when no one else would
and i aint the easiest guy to stick with
aisha studies him
if you two really fought he would kill you i think
im almost sure of it
because you care what happens to the others
you wouldnt put them at risk to save yourself
and you think thats a weakness
i know it is
law of the jungle
were not in the jungle
she looks at him
oh yes we are
blacked out windows
pooch behind the wheel cougar shotgun roque in back
back door slides open and clay and aisha enter
it doesnt go unnoticed
well thats just great
fed up pooch shuts the engine like dad in the family truckster
were not going anywhere until you two squash this shit
pooch were on a schedule here pooch takes the keys out of the ignition and folds his arms
looks over to roque
then sorry i hit you
a longer beat
sorry i threatened to cut your head off

i dont give a shit i do
starts the van now lets go watch jensen single handedly knock over the largest oil company on the planet
one large one stands out the goliath headquarters tower
jensen heads towards the building
street bicycle bike shorts messenger bag
hes disguised as a bike messenger
i got jungle fever youve got jungle fever weve got jungle fever were in love
jensen enters the reception area singing
moves to the receptionist desk
a pretty receptionist answering phones

i got jungle fever youve got jungle fever weve got jungle fever were in love
alone jensen opens the messenger bag
reveal a suit
pre set ready to slide on over his bike clothes
dials a cell phone while he dresses super fast
a secretary sitting in the outer office

jensen pantsless as the elevator stops
the th floor
the doors open
two secretaries about to enter the elevator freeze at the sight of pantsless jensen
the ladies stare at jensen
he calculates their gazes
liking the angle of the dangle
doors shut before they can protest
henderson a middle aged mid level manager reaches for his phone as the secretary looks on from her desk
this is henderson
good afternoon mr
henderson richard hertz from internal security
if youd be kind enough to make your way down to the lobby
can i ask what this is about
jensen is just about dressed
its a matter of a somewhat sensitive nature involving an
individual exposing himself to women in the elevators best discussed in person
if youd just head on down
henderson plods into his elevator
as the doors close on his elevator the doors open on the second elevator
jensen suited and pressed steps out
briefcase in hand
jensen enters looking down at hendersons secretary
hi im skippy from tech support
is henderson around
im supposed to install a firewall on his system oh you just missed him by like two seconds
can you come back in like an hour or so
jensen checks his watch
oooooh no can do
upstairs breathing down my neck
they want security upgraded for the senior managers all of a sudden
jensen already moving into hendersons office five minutes and ill be out of your hair
quick tight shots of jensen doing what jensen does best tearing into hendersons computer
hendersons secretary reaching for her phone
jensen checking his download
smiles at the secretary then looks back to he screen
pressing his radio according to this the drive exists clay
intercut with the van clay shoots a look at roque
is it in the building
no somewhere off site
its gotta be a remote location stand alone
im checking their security logs wherever theyve detailed the most guys is probably where itll be
hes face to face with a solid looking security officer
he tries a smile show me some id
jensen stands up holding his briefcase
take it easy
youre the wham
jensen smashes his metal briefcase across the security guards face
the guard is unconscious before he hits the ground
keying his radio earpiece get me out of here clay
theres a fire exit thirty yards north of your position
jensen heading for it
freeze like a statue pretty boy
jensen slow turns to find three guns trained straight at him
these guys look extremely competent
im warning you man im a lethal weapon
jensen turns on the big fellah
it was this secret government project
they did stuff to me
turned me into a dangerous telekinetic
wiggles index fingers as the old saying goes you dont start none
there wont be none
big security moves in on jensen with a pair of handcuffs
telekinetic your way out of this
jensen raises his right hand at the guard
fingers cocked like a gun aimed at the guards kevlar covered vest
the guard is hit hard blasted backwards off his feet
screaming in pain he goes down
jensen spins aims his left fingers at the second guard
and the second guard is blown backwards too kevlar vest smoking
moaning you broke my ribs
jensen fingers levelled at the third guard
please d dont shoot
tight on jensen full dirty harry
face down or ill make your hearts stop beating with my mind
jensen looks down at them
then slowly turns looking out the floor to ceiling glass windows
makes the ok sign out the window
three tight bullet holes in the glass
smash zoom out the window yards to a neighboring office tower
rifle still smoking
hat low the ever vigilant cougar
max on the phone
wade pokes his head in
hands him a note goliath just got hit
max cups his hand over the receiver as the voice on the other end prattles on
to wade by your boys
theyre not my boys
i dont like this
i say we grab clay and kill the rest
if you can find them
theres something in his voice
max looks at him
holds up a finger let me finish up here
into phone japanese hangs up to wade why mr
methinks you have a secret
put a fire team together
youre not going to call me in two hours and have me kill them
off maxs look im on it
the team gathers around as jensen downloads the goliath security specs off his computer
everything on goliath security personnel history the works
aishas brow furrows at this
only we notice
wheres the drive being kept
jensen spins the laptop around to show them graphics of port of new york baby
total stand alone facility and theyre spending k a day on onsite security you dont drop that kinda green to just guard oil
what are we up against
jensen typing let me check i oh shit
whats oh shit
jensen looks up at them
softly theyve hired par sec
this clearly means something bad to all of them
whos par sec
paradigm security services
ex special forces
basically guys like cougar but without the warm and cuddly side
cougar just glowers
goliath must have brought them in after we hit their truck
silence as they ponder the significance of a par sec security force
our drive is being guarded by military trained trigger repressed blood thirsty stone cold killers
am i the only one whos thinking maybe we just chill out and go to six flags
comb that drive for every last scrap of info
were on a plane for new york tomorrow
clays room again
knock at the door again
she covers his mouth with hers
jensen and pooch sitting at a table
both with laptops
jensen tapping his keys
roque enters carrying a coffee
stops short seeing the others
thought you guysd be back at the hotel
grabbed a coffee from the machine you want one
he slides into a chair
you wont believe how detailed these files are
every goliath executive theyve ever insured their policies their payouts life insurance
whats the biggest payout
gotta be wrongful death
pretty much what were gonna be risking
what are you doing up
jensen hacked a satellite for me earlier
the hell you need a satellite for
pooch shows him the screen of his computer recorded video from earlier in the day
an overhead view of a playground poochs daughters playing
they both watch for a bit
the only sound jensens typing
then when we first went over in jolene and my oldest tina wanted to do the yellow ribbon thing right
only problem was there was no yellow ribbon to be found all the stores had been cleaned out
and tinas four at the time and what she cant understand is why the ribbons gotta be yellow
so jolene sings her the song right
to show her where the idea comes from
and when shes all done tina four years old looks my wife dead in her eye and says thats the dumbest song i ever heard
so my wife and my four year old ended up tying a frilly purple ribbon round the old oak tree in our yard to bring daddy home
thought that counts right
jolene dated a guy last summer
didnt turn into anything and i sure as hell cant blame her but that man was in my house roque
i know youre not a hundred percent on this op but if it can get me back to them
i hear you man
a moment between them
broken by okay biggest payout on a goliath exec ever million and it was wrongful death vice president of operations in afghanistan three years ago paid to his daughter
he trails off in shock
looking to pooch and roque were going to need to drive fast
clay and aisha in bed
she traces her fingers along his teddy bear tattoo
clay looks down at her
she gives him a smile
mixing just the right amount of sensitivity and curiosity
you really want to know about afghanistan
as pooch tears through the texas streets
you think shes gonna kill him
various versions of uh uh
yeah i think so too
and this man you found in the basement he was your true target
maxs true target
and you spoke with him
he knew we were off mission
he knew max wanted him dead
did he beg
the man in the basement
did he beg for his life
he begged to die why are you asking me this
aisha smiles trying to recover but wham
the door splinters inwards and freeze
roque and pooch behind him guns drawn
aishas hand dips into her purse and comes up with a gun faster than you can spit mexican stand off time shes his daughter clay
the guy in the basements daughter and shes got a gun and its pointed
realizing not happy at my dick
her gun is pointed at my dick
would you rather i pointed it at your head
i know it makes no sense but actually yes
aisha adjusts pointing it at his head
as she does the bedsheet falls away from her upper body
we dont see the goods but our guys in the doorway do
aisha watches them
close on their eyes
jensens eyes flick downward
just for a millisecond but aisha pulls the trigger
jensen falls back screaming hit in the shoulder aisha moving and firing running for the bathroom nude the guys unloading at her she dives through the doorway holes punched in
the wall behind clays head as she returns fire through the drywall clay diving to the floor below the crossfire aisha kicks the bathroom door shut and suddenly everyones reloading
silence as clips are slapped into weapons until
taps his ear
shit shes got back up
clay pulls on his pants and they run for the door
smack into cougar who points into the sky two heavily armed cobras searchlights on headed for the motel
and again with that one important word run
the first cobra opens up with its automatic cannon
the bullets chewing up the far side of the cheap two story motel
our guys vault the railing sprinting to the van
pooch sliding behind the wheel as the others pile in
go go go
pooch hits the gas before his door is even shut
as they peel out of the parking lot the strafing hits the gas main whoomp
half the motel swallowed in a fireball
think that got her
she aint that lucky
my dick remains unshot
roque looking out the back window here they come
sure enough the cobras are now tracking the van
spotlights swinging towards them
the asphalt behind them erupts
cannon fire blowing huge chunks of road into the sky
screaming over the sound
somebody shoot something
cougar hefts his rifle
setting up shop in the back
sighting the choppers through his scope
jensen excited and a little delirious from blood loss i think cougars got a plan
coug do you have a plan
to the others hes got a plan
trying to steer stop yelling at the sniper
through the scope cougar sights the tail rotor of the chopper on the left
smiles presses the trigger
and we see how one bullet can bring down two helicopters
the bullet strikes the tail rotor dead center it shorts and spins off sending the chopper itself into a spin colliding with its twin chopper on the right they both
twist and hink up their rotors slicing into each other both finally careening onto the freeway behind our guys
driving away from the carnage of two exploding cobra helicopters splattered across the road
coming in for landing
as it taxis towards a hangar
max straightens his suit
wade on the phone frowning
he flips the phone shut
to max they got away
off wades look we know exactly where theyre going wade
port of new york for their big final awesome stand against the forces of evil where they die
he claps wade and the shoulder and heads down the steps
where the two indian scientists wait
the indian thug crew has been beefed up to about ten bizarre looking do you have the money
jesus always with the money
how are you
how have you been
i recently attended the funeral of my best friend who you had thrown out a window
how have you been
im thinking of getting satellite radio in my car
i think youre a freak
too much ronald mcdonald
too much fantasy football
max smiles and spreads his arms
hey im all about the bombs baby
we have your ordinance
you have twenty four hours to get the money
max looks over to wade
time to go make a withdrawal
as he turns back to the plane
new change of plan
ive got to go get your money
hell get your money
you stay right here
a pause as max contemplates this little twist
god are you short
twenty three hours fifty nine minutes
max looks at wade
get it done
wade heads for the jet
max watches him go
as wade boards the jet max takes a big sigh
for the first time looks like a guy who might not be quite as sure of things as he would like
max looks back to the short scientist
how much do you weigh
i do not think you are funny
where the hell is my bomb
the short scientist points to a large flatbed pick up
a heavy tarped bomb like package strapped to the back
you do not get it till i get the money
for a guy whos all about transcending materialism you talk about money so much
if you keep talking pop amm will cut your mouth out of your face
after business hours
a window smashes
roque climbs inside
goes to the front and unlocks it for the others who carry a bleeding jensen in
they lay him on a table
she burned us clay
the whole op is compromised i know
hey fallen comrade here
blood flowing out of his body
precious precious blood
gathers gauze needle thread and a wooden dowel
comes over as jensen looks at the last one
whats that for
cougar shoves it between jensens teeth as an answer
so we split up again
clay doesnt respond
goddammit clay whatever she knows max knows
his words echo through the room
jensen screams through the dowel as cougar sews him up
this is how low theyve sunk
clay finally looks up
we split up
some of us should go international
ill do that if nobody else wants to so we just run again
clay turns to him
theres nothing else we can do
then theres something we can do
three years is enough
if theres a drive at that port that we can use to get clear what part of he knows were coming for it do you not get
theyre gonna be waiting for us
par sec is gonna waiting for us
so figure out a way around them youre good at that shit clay
he turns addressing all of them we run now were gonna be running forever
this is our one chance to get our lives back
to steal them back
and im prepared to do anything to any one to make that happen
he looks clay dead in the eye
never play a longshot youre never gonna win
a long beat
clay not breaking his look with roque pooch whats the minimum time to scout the patrols get an accurate head count on site at the port
hours but aisha knows that so we hit them in twelve
twelve hours from now
you mean you want us to go in blind
last thing theyll expect
yeah cause its dumb
jensens already got the layout and cougar can spot on site
yeah cause gettin shot is awesome im totally up for doing it again
he gives a weak thumbs up
all thats left is pooch
pooch struggling with the decision
last time we went in blind on an op we lost everything
pooch looks up
so lets go get it back
the harbor is enormous
a small twin hurricane boat cuts through the morning waves
half mile from the goliath docks
at the controls clay and roque
goliath employees going about their business preparing for a tanker docking
all seems normal until we look a bit closer four man par sec security patrols
bomb sniffing dogs
two cobra attack choppers
a goliath tanker approaches from behind
roque looks back at the tanker
not answering he seems to have something on his mind
clay drops the twin throttles and spins the speed boat towards the approaching tanker
several tugs and security launches are maneuvering around it
clay and roque approach one of the launches from behind
they take the two security men from behind with tasers then strip off their outer gear revealing par sec uniforms
a block off the front gate
a blacked out chevy van
pooch sits behind the wheel
ready for exfiltration
the pooch is good
cougar squelch if youre in position
a drainage pipe with a thick security cage covering it
we push in hard reveal a small opening cut in the cage it through the opening fire feet into the pipe through a second opening down another long pipe and
slam up hard on cougar
crouched below the terminal
looking up through a grilled man hole at par sec guards
clay and roque dock their launch and hop out
blending in perfectly with the par sec guards
jensen were coming
a huge shipping room with hundreds of crates
we push in on a large wooden crate
the side of the crate starts to flex
and splinters as jensen breaks out of his box
and the crowd goes wild
clay and roque approach
from the inside jensen leaning up against the door
whats the password
open the door before we kill you
jensen opens the door
clay and roque quickly move in
drive should be in the computer room two skylights over
roque and i will set the charges here but we wont detonate until you have the drive
you cant settle for stealing the drive you gotta blow up goliaths shit too
what can i say i hold a grudge
knows how important his job is
heading for a ladder
clay and roque begin to set charges throughout the room
be ready to move the second cougar hits the fire alarm
cougar avoiding security
scaling a large oil tank taking up a sniper position on top of it
jensen hopping rooftop to rooftop
cougar in full sniper fire position
his sights dead on a master fire alarm yards down
his radio crackles guys we got a problem
pooch in the van seeing through binoculars
and he is
being given a tour by par sec guards
are you kidding me
i say we roll
jensen by a mirrored skylight so you cant see down into the room
attaching a harness to his waist
im above the computer room maybe thirty seconds from the drive
clay listening through the radio wades headed your way last chance to get the duck out of fodge
somethings not right
roque standing in front of a huge cargo container
i think you should see this
roques got the doors of the container opened that hes looking in
jensen finally ready to hit the computer room genuflects once for luck
clay and roque staring
the container top to bottom completely loaded with fresh minted stack bundles of cash
more physical money than we have ever seen
by a lot
clay turns to him as wham
a crowbar smashes down on his head
roque gripping it looking down at clay
you know for a revenge driven conspiracy nut youre pretty fucking gullible
jensen leaping through the skylight
smashing down through the glass
and landing in an empty room
no stand alone drives
except for par sec guards with weapons trained at his head
pooch sitting in the van into the radio jensen you get it
does not see the five par sec soldiers moving in on his car long guns up and out
cougar flexed and aimed
scope locked in on the fire alarm
safety off on a gun pressed to his temple
he lays down the gun and puts his hands behind his head
furious at himself for getting caught
from the shadows wade enters
clay looks up at him
head wounds bleed bad
the crowbar caused a mother of a gusher on clay
he wipes blood from his eyes
after the truck
i got tired of waiting for you to save us so i up and saved myself
reached out like i said and cut a deal i set this up i go free
he begins walking around clay as he talks
you gave me no choice
it was always gonna end like this clay
us captured or dead
it was always a dead end
you made sure of it
you were gonna keep planning missions and ways to hit max until it got us all killed
only difference with this situation is at least i get to walk away
we all could have walked
used the drive
dont you get it yet
there is no drive
there never was
wade begins laughing
clay looks like hes been slapped
fennel made it up to save himself
when i told wade he planted the info at goliath to lead you here
clay stares at him
you really thought there was a happy ending coming
pooch was gonna get his family back we were gonna get to be soldiers again
leans down softly we lost the moment we went off mission
this is just the logical conclusion of that playing out
you didnt want to hear it
you just wanted your revenge
your face to face with the big bad wolf
im sorry buddy but its the way of the world
roque straightens back up shaking his head guys like us dont beat guys like him
in the corner wade nods at this
behind him a large semi pulls up to the cash container
over the following a hydraulic lift hoists the cash container onto the truck kill me now
maybe you live through this
oh were not gonna kill you
someones gotta get away with the cash
im definitely wasting them
he nods to the hydro winch slowly lowering the cash container onto the flat bed with a smile
youre about to steal a billion dollars from the central intelligence agency
clay stares at daggers at both of them
its for our replacement nuke
when a billion goes missing people tend to ask who took it
max really does love to frame you
several par sec guards arrive
wade points to clay take him away
drop him in newark
ill see you at turner airfield
the guards handcuff clay and drag him to his feet
pushing him towards the door
as he hustled past roque wait
roque looks at his old friend
im sorry it had to end this way
clay stares back at him
youre going to die very badly
the guards hustle clay out the door
par sec guards lead the pooch jensen and cougar towards the far end of the terminal
cougar looks up to see a separate set of guards leading clay the opposite way
their eyes connect both knowing theyve lost
answering the question roque
cougar lowers his head sadly
clays pushed into a truck
the guards take pooch jensen and cougar behind a warehouse
looking at each other
knowing this is the end of the line
the lead guard racks his machine gun
on your knees
pooch spits at him
the lead guard calmly shoots him in pooch screams
the par sec boys force cougar and jensen down too clubbing them with their rifles
pooch looks up at his assailant
gasps through the pain get on with it
the lead guard smiles
looks to cougar whos shredding his skin to the bone trying to claw out of the cuffs
thats a nice hat
he steps forward to take it but cougar is too quick for the man moving his head away
he reaches for cougar again
again cougar evades
the guards laugh at their colleague who continues trying to grab cougars hat
the lead guard has had enough of cougars antics
levelling the rifle at his head
dont really care of theres a hole in it
one wash good as
what are you smiling at
cougars nods past him
as the guards turn to see on top of an oil tank
as she rises up to standing a slant k rocket hip blaster locked and loaded
looking like an old testament style goddess of vengeance and destruction
a moment of frozen shock on the rest of wades hit crew
and she pulls the trigger
a high pitched whistle as the rocket streaks across the terminal
headed straight for an enormous fuel tank
the explosion rocks the entire terminal
the truck clay is prisoner in is blown into the air by the shockwave
smashing down onto its side skidding
cougar and jensen destroy the remaining par secs with legs
grabbing cuff keys and freeing themselves
shouldnt have gone after the hat
cougar kicks the guard in the face knocking him cold
aisha rappels off the oil tower in the distance
various par sec teams fire at her
cougar scoops up two rifles and tosses one to jensen they give her covering fire as she comes
as he shoots to the wounded pooch can you stand
ive been shot in both legs what kind of dumbass question is that
oh so were mr
youre not the only one whos been shot recently you know
he empties a full clip into a par sec team and reloads
aisha pinned down forty yards away
almost out of ammo
par sec team almost on top of her when a figure emerges from an overturned truck
gun in each hand blazing
the par secs cut down one by one
the figure lowers his guns
walks up to her
underneath the blood oil and grime its clay
they stare at each other
then incredibly aisha raises her weapon at him
did you kill my father
jensen comes running up interrupting clay
kind of in the middle of something here jensen did you kill him
there was no drive clay
eyes on aisha there was no drive and roques gone and par secs regrouping and pooch could bleed out aishas had enough thumbing the hammer back did you kill him
clay about to respond when i did
they turn to see our long tall sniper standing above them
he asked us
it was mercy
but youre his family so i understand
and then incredibly cougar lays his rifle at her feet
but only me
clay and jensen blink shocked
aisha stares at cougar equally surprised
she levels her pistol at his head
we cut wide to see
muzzle flash from aishas gun
in close again
aisha stands over cougars body
the others stunned
and then cougar rises
cheek ripped open from where the bullet creased his flesh
she fires again blam
identical scar on his other cheek
blood runs down his face
he doesnt move to wipe it away
leans down picks up his rifle
okay excellent very tribal we need to go
as if on cue bullets kick up dust around them
a new par sec team incoming
clay jensen aisha and cougar hightail it back to where pooch lies
can you stand
this is stupid question day isnt it
its stupid question day and someone forgot to tell me
clay slings pooch over his shoulders fireman carry style
looks across the terminal to where poochs van is parked
push in on clays face for lets go
and they do
sprinting across the open space in slo mo cougar and aisha wasting everything that moves
a full on ballet of fully automatic mayhem
they make it to the van
cougar behind the wheel guns the engine and they peel out
pulling on to the highway
silence sets in
the high of the firefight over
just pain and loss now
five people some terribly wounded with nowhere to go
just the rocking of the van as it heads down the road
way it goes
way it always goes
clay looks at him
guess we should just head home
oh wait thats right
we dont have homes
clay doesnt respond
aisha studies him
knows what has to be done
they all do
from behind the wheel where to colonel
clay looks up at the use of rank
wade pulls up in a corvette
gets out and walks over as roque finishes supervising par sec guards finish loading the cash onto a huge transport plane
your friends jack rabbitted
should we be worried
clay doesnt take risks
its why im here and hes not
can i ask you something
whyd you stick with those losers for so long
then they were good guys
wade half smiles at this
shaking his head
no such thing
ill go call max
he begins walking towards hangar
as the fence by the airstrip is smashed inwards by the van
headed straight for him
roque turns to the pilot declan start the plane
wade raises his uzi and fires taking out the vans front tires
the van flips
smashing end over end finally coming to a rest on its side
climbing out groaning next time remind me car crash first then get shot
sounds less painful that way
clay looks across the tarmac to see the plane begin to taxi
roque stands in they back loading ramp still down
flips clay a salute
cougar and i are going after that plane
the rest of you get wade
me and legless pooch are on it
where the hell is she going
aisha is heading off to the fenceline
clay and cougar run for wades corvette
cougar slides behind the wheel and starts her up peeling out after the plane
you call me legless pooch again youre gonna be headless jensen
what its a cool name
it makes you sound like a pirate
off his look fine lets go kill wade
cougar guns the engine catching up to the taxiing transport plane
clay leans out the window shooting at huddled in the planes cargo hold returning fire
the pilot yelling to him
we dont have enough runway to take off were going to have to turn around and come back to get up to speed
fine just get us in the air
he fires another burst from his weapon at the vette
click his weapon dry
in the corvette simultaneously clay weapon dry
he stares through the windshield to look at roque
get me closer
jensen enters carrying a machine gun
ala the warriors come out and plaaaayyy the roar of an engine jensen dives out of the way as wade whips past on a motorcycle
heading for the runway
hey wades coming at you
he trails off
looking at the lear jet that wade arrived in
sitting in the hangars corner
keys the radio
i think i just found our way out of here
the corvette pulling behind the still lowered rear ramp of the transport plane
clay onto the corvettes hood
roque rising to meet him
waiting for him
landing on the ramp
in the cargo hold roque smiles
pulls a wicked looking knife
the two men stand there
sizing one another up
gotta admit i always wondered how this would play out
aisha thinks you kill me
its a distinct possibility
they begin circling one another
clay still weaponless
you dont have a knife
dont need one
bit of as longshot for you
roque lunges at him
but clay does have a knife
he pulls it and slams it into roques belly
for most men that would be the end of the fight
but not these two
roque gives clay a bloody grin
now i really am gonna cut your head off
he lunges again
and now it is fully on
the blades whip up and down almost too fast to see roque gets clay with a left cross then buries his knife in clays shoulder
clay twists free slashes at roque
ten seconds in the men separate again
clay sees roque doesnt have his knife
looks realizing its still embedded in his own shoulder
pulls it out tosses it back to roque
they stand there both panting
then run at each other full tilt
heres how it ends
and pay attention it happens fast clay goes low coming up to grab roques knife hand which is arcing downwards towards clays throat clay manages to halt the hand blade
inches from his adams apple and theres a moment where roque could overpower him and actually cut his head off
but clay throws his weight forward and breaks roques right arm
and for the first time roque screams
which seems to make clay happy
so he breaks roques left arm too
roque falls to his knees broken bloody and beaten
to reveal the pilot
leaning out of the cockpit desert eagle levelled at clay
the pilot pulls the trigger
the bullet slams into clays abdomen and blows him off his feet backwards flying out of the plane and landing on hood of clay smashes down on the windshield cougar
pumps the brakes and spins the wheel desperately trying to keep clay from rolling off the hood
turning around at the end of the runway
beginning its final run to get up to speed
now driving towards it on a chicken like collision course when whoosh
wade flies past on his motorcycle
clay turns to cougar through the spiderwebbed windshield rifle
cougar passes clay his sniper rifle and floors it
at one end of the runway the plane starting to take off
at the opposite end wades motorcycle heading full speed at the approaching plane
cougar and clay chasing wade
and then aisha steps out into the middle of the runway
the rocket launcher clutched in her hands
she takes a knee
aims at the plane which is almost at lift speed
roque sees her from the cockpit
she locks eyes with him and grins firing into the landing gear of the plane as
pulls even with wade
instead of shooting clay throws cougars rifle between the spokes of wades front tire causing the bike to catapult wade off and forward
through the air and into the right number two jet engine of the now flying cargo plane
the engine explodes
aisha somehow safe on the ground looking up at the escaping plane
clay looking up
all of them watching
as roque dies very badly
the big plane explodes in a monster fireball va dooom
burning gas and iron and cash
bloody eyes bitterly triumphant
clay stares at the sight before him
only one word for it
jensen approaches supporting pooch
not to rain on everyones we killed all the bad guys parade but we should probably get gone legless pooch has a learjet all gassed up for us in the
off poochs look its a cool name from the smashed up bike wade was driving wades cell phone rings
clay gets off the hood of the vette and cougar and aisha help him hobble over
answering it hello
max and the indians
intercut with clay we good
tight on clay realizing who hes talking to
not by a longshot
youre not having a real great day max
who is this
just a voice on the phone
working on the engines
a beat as it hits max
in the distance sirens
i understand youve always wanted to meet face to face
im sure that could be arranged
then i dont think the guys youre about to stiff for a billion dollars are going to allow that to happen
looks to the others we win
he snaps the phone shut and tosses it into the fire
turns to the others
ready when you are
pooch jensen and cougar start for the hangar
clay looks to aisha
a moment between them
i wanted to find and punish those responsible for my fathers death
max his men everyone
that why you slept with me
that and the cardio
good cause theres no way i could walk it
she helps him up and we begin to pull up and back as they head for the hangar
max lowers the phone
the short scientist has run out of patience
time is up stretch
max looks at the short scientist
thats a good one
but he doesnt look like hes very amused
because you are so much taller than i
yeah no i get it
the short scientist looks at max
slowly gets up leaves max alone in the room with the ten indians
max takes a deep breath looks up at the death squad
you gentlemen consider yourselves to be soldiers or businessmen
we think its the end
but then we hear wind
blowing through trees
the soft sound of evening television
a nice quiet neighborhood
outside the kitchen window poochs wife jolene doing dishes in the sink again
jolene looks up this time
she obviously heard it
she puts down the dishes and goes to the door
opens it and looks out to see
not even by the swingset
about to head back inside when she spies a glint of light
by the oak tree in the front
she steps outside
walks down until she sees what it is
her breath hitches in her chest
a frilly purple ribbon is tied around the old oak tree
and now there are tears in jolenes eyes
because she knows what it means
her husband is alive
and he will make it home
