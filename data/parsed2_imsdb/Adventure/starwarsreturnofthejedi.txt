completion date december the boundless heavens serve as a back drop for the main title followed by a roll up which crawls into infinity
episode vi luke skywalker has returned to his home planet of tatooine in an attempt to rescue his friend han solo from the clutches of theevile gangster jabba the hutt
little does luke know that the galactic empire has secretly begun construction on a new armored space station even more powerful than the first dreaded death star
when completed this ultimate weapon will spell certain doom for the small band of rebels struggling to restore freedom to the galaxy
pan down to reveal a monstrous half completed death star its massive superstructure curling away from the completed section like the arms of a giant octopus
beyond in benevolent contrast floats the small green moon of endor
an imperial star destroyer moves overhead toward the massive armored space station followed by two zipping tie fighters
a small imperial shuttle rockets from the main bay of the ship and hustles toward the death star
the shuttle captain makes contact with the death star
command station this is st
code clearance blue
were starting our approach
deactivate the security shield
death star controller filtered vo the security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have confirmation of your code transmission
you are clear to proceed
were starting our approach
operators move about among the control panels
a shield operator hits switches beside a large screen on which is a display of the death star the moon endor and a bright web delineating the invisible deflector shield
a control officer rushes over to the shield operator
inform the commander that lord vaders shuttle has arrived
the control officer moves to a view port and watches as the imperial shuttle lands in the massive docking bay
a squad of imperial stormtroopers moves into formation before the craft
the death star commander moff jerjerrod a tall confident technocrat strides through the assembled troops to the base of the shuttle ramp
the troops snap to attention many are uneasy about the new arrival
but the death star commander stands arrogantly tall
the exit hatch of the shuttle opens with a whoosh revealing only darkness
then heavy footsteps and mechanical breathing
from this black void appears darth vader lord of the sith
vader looks over the assemblage as he walks down the ramp
lord vader this is an unexpected pleasure
were honored by your presence
you may dispense with the pleasantries commander
im here to put you back on schedule
the commander turns ashen and begins to shake
i assure you lord vader my men are working as fast as they can
perhaps i can find new ways to motivate them
i tell you this station will be operational as planned
the emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation
but he asks the impossible
i need more men
then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives
jerjerrod aghast the emperors coming here
that is correct commander
and he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress
we shall double our efforts
i hope so commander for your sake
the emperor is not as forgiving as i am
a lonely windswept road meanders through the desolate tatooine terrain
we hear a familiar beeping and a distinctive reply before catching sight of artoo detoo and see threepio making their way along the road toward the ominous palace of jabba
of course im worried
and you should be too
lando calrissian and poor chewbacca never returned from this awful place
artoo whistles timidly
dont be so sure
if i told you half the things ive heard about this jabba the hutt youd probably short circuit
the two droids fearfully approach the massive gate to the palace
artoo are you sure this is the right place
i better knock i suppose
threepio looks around for some kind of signaling device then timidly knocks on the iron door
threepio instantly there doesnt seem to be anyone there
lets go back and tell master luke
a small hatch in the middle of the door opens and a spidery mechanical arm with a large electronic eyeball on the end pops out and inspects the two droids
tee chuta hhat yudd
goodness gracious me
threepio points to artoo then to himself
artoo detoowha bo seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka jabba du hutt
the eye looks from one robot to the other there is a laugh then the eye zips back into the door
the hatch slams shut
artoo beeps his concern
i dont think theyre going to let us in artoo
wed better go
artoo beeps his reluctance as threepio turns to leave
suddenly the massive door starts to rise with a horrific metallic screech
the robots turn back and face an endless black cavity
the droids look at one another afraid to enter
artoo starts forward into the gloom
threepio rushes after his stubby companion
the door lowers noisily behind them
artoo i really dont think we should rush into all this
artoo continues down the corridor with threepio following
artoo wait for me
the door slams shut with a loud crash that echoes throughout the dark passageway
the frightened robots are met by two giant green gamorrean guards who fall in behind them
threepio glances quickly back at the two lumbering brutes then back to artoo
one guard grunts an order
artoo beeps nervously
just you deliver master lukes message and get us out of here
walking toward them out of the darkness is bib fortuna a humanlike alien with long tentacles protruding from his skull
die wanna wanga
die wanna wauaga
we we bring a message to your master jabba the hutt
artoo lets out a series of quick beeps
threepio cont and a gift
thinks a moment then to artoo gift what gift
bib shakes his head negatively
nee jabba no badda
me chaade su goodie
bib holds out his hand toward artoo and the tiny droid backs up a bit letting out a protesting array of squeaks
threepio turns to the strange looking alien
he says that our instructions are to give it only to jabba himself
bib thinks about this for a moment
im terribly sorry
im afraid hes ever so stubborn about these sort of things
bib gestures for the droids to follow
the droids follow the tall tentacled alien into the darkness trailed by the two guards
artoo i have a bad feeling about this
the throne room is filled with the vilest most grotesque creatures ever conceived in the universe
artoo and threepio seem very small as they pause in the doorway to the dimly lit chamber
light shafts partially illuminate the drunken courtiers as bib fortuna crosses the room to the platform upon which rests the leader of this nauseating crowd jabba the hutt
the monarch of the galactic underworld is a repulsive blob of bloated fat with a maniacal grin
chained to the horrible creature is the beautiful alien female dancer named oola
at the foot of the dais sits an obnoxious birdlike creature salacious crumb
bib whispers something in the slobbering degenerates ear
jabba laughs horribly at the two terrified droids before him
threepio bows politely
the robots jump forward to stand before the repulsive loose skinned villain
the message artoo the message
artoo whistles and a beam of light projects from his domed head creating a hologram of luke on the floor
the image grows to over ten feet tall and the young jedi towers over the space gangsters
greetings exalted one
allow me to introduce myself
i am luke skywalker jedi knight and friend to captain solo
i know that you are powerful mighty jabba and that your anger with solo must be equally powerful
i seek an audience with your greatness to bargain for solos life
jabbas crowd laughs with your wisdom im sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation
as a token of my goodwill i present to you a gift these two droids
threepio is startled by this announcement
what did he say
luke cont both are hardworking and will serve you well
this cant be
artoo youre playing the wrong message
lukes hologram disappears
jabba laughs while bib speaks to him in huttese
jabba in huttese subtitled there will be no bargain
jabba in huttese subtitled i will not give up my favorite decoration
i like captain solo where he is
jabba laughs hideously and looks toward an alcove beside the throne
hanging high flat against the wall exactly as we saw him last is a carbonized han solo
and hes still frozen in carbonite
one of jabbas gamorrean guards marches artoo and threepio down a dank shadowy passageway lined with holding cells
the cries of unspeakable creatures bounce off the cold stone walls
occasionally a repulsive arm or tentacle grabs through the bars at the hapless droids
artoo beeps pitifully
what could possibly have come over master luke
is it something i did
he never expressed any unhappiness with my work
a large tentacle wraps around threepios neck
he manages to break free and they move on to a door at the end of the corridor
the door slides open revealing a room filled with steam and noisy machinery
the guard motions them into the boiler room where they are met by a tall thin humanlike robot named ev d
behind the robot can be seen a torture rack pulling the legs off a screaming baby work droid
a second power droid is upside down
as smoking branding irons are pressed into his feet the stubby robot lets out an agonized electronic scream
artoo and threepio cringe as the guard grunts to ev ah good
you are a protocol droid are you not
i am see threepio human cy
yes or no will do
how many languages do you speak
i am fluent in over six million forms of communication and can readily
we have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him
ninedenine to a gamorrean guard guard
this protocol droid might be useful
fit him with a restraining bolt and take him back to his excellencys main audience chamber
the guard shoves threepio toward the door
threepio disappearing artoo dont leave me
artoo lets out a plaintive cry as the door closes
then he beeps angrily
youre a feisty little one but youll soon learn some respect
i have need for you on the masters sail barge
and i think youll fit in nicely
the poor work droid in the background lets out another tortured electronic scream
the court of jabba the hutt is in the midst of a drunken raucous party
sloppy smelly monsters cheer and make rude noises as oola and a fat female dancer perform in front of jabbas throne
jabba leers at the dancers and with a lustful gleam in his eye beckons oola to come and sit with him
she stops dancing and backs away shaking her head
jabba gets angry and points to a spot next to him
the lovely alien shakes her head again and screams
na chuba negatorie na
jabba is furious and pulls her toward him tugging on the chain
he pushes a button and before the dancer can flee a trap door in the floor springs open and swallows her up
as the door snaps shut a muffled growl is followed by a hideous scream
jabba and his monstrous friends laugh hysterically and several revelers hurry over to watch her fate through a grate
threepio cringes and glances wistfully at the carbonite form of han solo but is immediately distracted by a gunshot offscreen
ean unnatural quiet sweeps the boisterous gathering
on the far side of the room the crush of debauchers moves aside to allow the approach of two guards followed by boushh an oddly cloaked bounty hunter leading his
captive han solos copilot chewbacca the wookiee
bib takes his place next to his disgusting master and whispers into his ear pointing at chewbacca and the bounty hunter
jabba listens intently then the bounty hunter bows before the gangster and speaks a greeting in a strange electronically processed tongue ubese
boushh in ubese subtitled i have come for the bounty on this wookiee
jabba in huttese subtitled at last we have the mighty chewbacca
jabba lets out a loud long blood curdling laugh and turns to threepio waving him closer
the reluctant droid obeys
oh uh yes uh i am here your worshipfulness
jabba continues speaking as threepio nervously translates
boushh listens studying the dangerous creatures around the room
he notices boba fett standing near the door
the illustrious jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty five thousand
boushh in ubese subtitled i want fifty thousand
jabba immediately flies into a rage knocking the golden droid off the raised throne into a clattering heap on the floor
boushh adjusts his weapon as jabba raves in huttese and threepio struggles back onto the throne
the disheveled droid tries to compose himself
but what what did i say
to boushh uh the mighty jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand
the bounty hunter holds up a small silver ball in his hand
threepio looks at it then looks at jabba then back to the bounty hunter
the droid is very nervous and jabba is getting very impatient
because hes holding a thermal detonator
the guards instantly back away as do most of the other monsters in the room
jabba stares at the silver ball which begins to glow in the bounty hunters hand
the room has fallen into a tense hush
jabba stares at the bounty hunter malevolently until a sly grin creeps across his vast mouth and he begins to laugh
jabba in huttese subtitled this bounty hunter is my kind of scum
fearless and inventive
jabba offers the sum of thirty five
and i suggest you take it
bib and the other monsters study the bounty hunter and wait for his reaction
boushh releases a switch on the thermal detonator and it goes dead
the raucous crowd of monsters erupts in a symphony of cheers and applause as the party returns to its full noisy pitch
as he is led away we spot lando calrissian disguised as a skiff guard in a partial face mask
the band starts up and dancing girls take the center of the floor to the hoots of the loudly appreciative creatures
boushh leans against a column with gunfighter cool and surveys the scene his gaze stopping only when it connects with a glare from across the room
boba fett is watching him
boushh shifts slightly cradling his weapon lovingly
boba fett shifts with equally ominous arrogance
gamorrean guards lead chewie down the same hallway we saw before
when a tentacle reaches out at the wookiee chewies ferocious roar echoes against the walls and the tentacle snaps back into its cell in terror
it takes all the guards to hurl chewie roughly into a cell slamming the door behind him
chewie lets out a pathetic howl and bangs on the iron door
the palace is sitting in the light of the double sunset
on the road in front a large toadlike creature flicks its tongue out for a desert rodent and burps in satisfaction
the room is deserted only the awful debris of the alien celebration giving mute witness to the activity here before
several drunk creatures lie unconscious around the room snoring loudly
a shadowy figure moves stealthily among the columns at the perimeter of the room and is revealed to be boushh the bounty hunter
he picks his way carefully through the snoring drunken monsters
han solo the frozen space pirate hangs spotlighted on the wall his coffin like case suspended by a force field
the bounty hunter deactivates the force field by flipping a control switch to one side of the coffin
the heavy case slowly lowers to the floor of the alcove
boushh steps up to the case studying han and then turns to the controls on the side of the coffin
he activates a series of switches and after one last hesitant look at han slides the de carbonization lever
the case begins to emit a sound as the hard shell covering the contours of hans face begins to melt away
the bounty hunter watches as hans body is freed of its metallic coat and his forearms and hands previously raised in reflexive protest drop slackly to his side
his face muscles relax from their mask of horror
he appears quite dead
boushhs ugly helmet leans close to hans face listening for the breath of life
hans eyes pop open with a start and he begins coughing
the bounty hunter steadies the staggering newborn
just relax for a moment
youre free of the carbonite
han touches his face with his hand and moans
you have hibernation sickness
i cant see
your eyesight will return in time
where am i
who are you
the bounty hunter reaches up and lifts the helmet from his head revealing the beautiful face of princess leia
someone who loves you
i gotta get you out of here
as leia helps her weakened lover to stand up the relative quiet is pierced by an obscene huttese cackle from the other side of the alcove
i know that laugh
the curtain on the far side of the alcove opens revealing jabba the hutt surrounded by bib and other aliens
he laughs again and his gross cronies join in a cacophony of alien glee
look jabba i was just on my way to pay you back but i got a little sidetracked
its not my fault
jabba in huttese subtitled its too late for that solo
you may have been a good smuggler but now youre bantha fodder
jabba cont huttese subtitled take him away
the guards grab han and start to lead him away
ill pay you triple
youre throwing away a fortune here
dont be a fool
han is dragged off as lando quickly moves forward and attempts to lead leia away
jabba in huttese subtitled bring her to me
jabba chuckles as lando and a second guard drag the beautiful young princess toward him
threepio peeks from behind a monster and quickly turns away in disgust
we have powerful friends
youre gonna regret this
jabba in huttese subtitled im sure
inexorably her lovely face moves to within a few inches of jabbas ugly blob of a head and leia turns away in disgust
ohhh i cant bear to watch
the heavy metal door of the dungeon whines and slowly creaks open
a guard throws the blinded star captain into the dark cell and the door slams shut behind him leaving only a thin sliver of light from a crack in the
han is trying to collect himself when suddenly a growl is heard from the far side of the cell
he jumps back against the cell door and listens
chewie is that you
the shadowy figure lets out a crazy yell and races toward han lifting him off the ground with a big hug that carries them into the light revealing chewie
the giant wookiee barks with glee
i cant see pal
whats goin on
chewie barks an excited blue streak
he cant even take care of himself much less rescue anybody
chewie barks a reply
i im out of it for a little while everybody gets delusions of grandeur
chewie growls insistently
he holds han to his chest and pets his head
im all right pal
im all right
noisily the main gate lifts to flood the blackness with blinding light and reveal the silhouetted figure of luke skywalker
he is clad in a robe similar to bens and wears neither pistol nor laser sword
luke strides purposefully into the hallway
two giant guards move to block lukes path
luke raises his hand and points at the puzzled guards who immediately lower their spears and fall back
the young jedi lowers his hand and moves on down the hallway
bib fortuna appears out of the gloom
he speaks to luke as they approach each other but luke doesnt stop and bib must reverse his direction and hurry alongside the young jedi in order to carry on
several other guards fall in behind them in the darkness
i must speak with jabba
bib answers in huttese shaking his head in denial
luke stops and stares at bib he raises his hand slightly
you will take me to jabba now
bib turns in hypnotic response to lukes command and luke follows him into the gloom
you serve your master well
and you will be rewarded
jabba is asleep on his throne with leia lying in front of him
salacious sits by jabbas tail watching it wriggle
leia is now dressed in the skimpy costume of a dancing girl a chain runs from a manacle necklace at her throat to her new master jabba the hutt
threepio stands behind jabba as bib comes up to the gangster slug
master lukes come to rescue me
jabba awakens with a start and bib continues in huttese
luke skywalker jedi knight
jabba in huttese subtitled i told you not to admit him
i must be allowed to speak
bib in huttese subtitled he must be allowed to speak
jabba furious clobbers bib and shoves him away
jabba in huttese subtitled you weak minded fool
hes using an old jedi mind trick
luke stares hard at jabba
you will bring captain solo and the wookiee to me
jabba in huttese subtitled your mind powers will not work on me boy
nevertheless im taking captain solo and his friends
you can either profit by this
or be destroyed
its your choice
but i warn you not to underestimate my powers
jabbas laugh is mean and loud
threepio attempts to warn luke about the pit
master luke youre standing on
jabba in huttese subtitled there will be no bargain young jedi
i shall enjoy watching you die
luke reaches out and a pistol jumps out of a guards holster and flies into lukes hand
the bewildered guard grabs for it as jabba raises his hand
the floor suddenly drops away sending luke and the hapless guard into the pit
the pistol goes off blasting a hole in the ceiling
jabba laughs and his courtiers join in
leia starts forward but is restrained by a human guard lando recognizable behind his mask
she looks at him and he shakes his head no
luke and the guard have dropped twenty five feet from a chute into the dungeonlike cage
luke gets to his feet as the guard yells hysterically for help
a crowd gathers up around the edge of the pit as the door in the side of the pit starts to rumble open
the guard screams in panic
luke looks calmly around for a means of escape
at the side of the pit an iron door rumbles upward and a giant fanged rancor emerges
the guard runs to the side of the pit and tries futilely to scramble to the top
the hideous beast closes in on him
the rancor moves past luke and as the guard continues to scramble the rancor picks him up and pops him into its slavering jaws
a few screams and the guard is swallowed with a gulp
the audience cheers and laughs at the guards fate
the monster turns and starts for luke
the young jedi dashes away just ahead of the monsters swipe at him and picks up the long arm bone of an earlier victim
the monster grabs luke and brings him up to his salivating mouth
at the last moment luke wedges the bone in the monsters mouth and is dropped to the floor
the monster bellows in rage and flails about hitting the side of the pit causing an avalanche
the monster crushes the bone in its jaws and sees luke who squeezes into a crevice in the pit wall
luke looks past the monster to the holding cave beyond
on the far side of the holding cave is a utility door if only he can get to it
the rancor spots luke and reaches into the crevice for him
luke grabs a large rock and raises it smashing it down on the rancors finger
the rancor lets out a loud howl as luke makes a run for the holding cave
he reaches the door and pushes a button to open it
when he succeeds he sees a heavy barred gate between him and safety
beyond the gate two guards look up from their dinner
luke turns to see the monster heading for him and pulls with all his might on the gate
the guards move to the gate and start poking at the young jedi with spears laughing
luke crouches against the wall as the monster starts to reach for him
suddenly he notices a main door control panel halfway up the wall
as the rancor moves in for the kill luke picks up a skull from the cave floor and hurls it at the panel
the giant overhead door comes crashing down on the beasts head squashing it like a sledgehammer on an egg
a startled gasp is heard from the stunned court
theres consternation at this turn of events
heads look to jabba who is actually turning red with anger
leia cannot suppress her joy
jabba utters harsh commands to his guards and they hurry off
jabba in huttese subtitled bring me solo and the wookiee
they will all suffer for this outrage
the rancor keepers have come into the cage and are examining their dead beast
one of them breaks down and weeps
the other glares menacingly at luke who is unworried
several guards rush into the holding tunnel and take luke away
the crowd of creepy courtiers parts as han and chewie are brought into the throne room and other guards drag luke up the steps
are you all right
together again huh
wouldnt miss it
how are we doing
the same as always
that bad huh
luke looks to leia
threepio is standing behind the grotesque gangster as he strokes leia like a pet cat
several of the guards including lando bring luke from the other side of the room
boba is standing behind jabba
threepio steps forward and translates for the captives
his high exaltedness the great jabba the hutt has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately
good i hate long waits
you will therefore be taken to the dune sea and cast into the pit of carkoon the nesting place of the all powerful sarlacc
han to luke doesnt sound so bad
in his belly you will find a new definition of pain and suffering as you are slowly digested over a thousand years
on second thought lets pass on that huh
chewie barks his agreement
you should have bargained jabba
thats the last mistake youll ever make
jabba cackles evilly at this
as the guards drag the prisoners from the throne room a loud cheer rises from the crowd
leia and chewie exchange concerned looks but luke skywalker jedi warrior cannot suppress a smile
jabbas huge sail barge moves above the desert surface accompanied by two smaller skiffs
one of the skiffs glides close revealing luke han and chewie all in bonds surrounded by guards one of whom is lando in disguise
i think my eyes are getting better
instead of a big dark blur i see a big light blur
theres nothing to see
i used to live here you know
youre gonna die here you know
just stick close to chewie and lando
ive taken care of everything
jabba the hutt rides like a sultan in the massive antigravity ship
his entire retinue is with him drinking eating and having a good time
leia is watching her friends in the skiff when the chain attached to her neck is pulled tight and jabba tugs the scantily clad princess to him
jabba in huttese subtitled soon you will learn to appreciate me
threepio wanders among the sail barge aliens bumping into a smaller droid serving drinks spilling them all over the place
the stubby droid lets out an angry series of beeps and whistles
oh im terribly sor
what are you doing here
artoo beeps a quick reply
well i can see youre serving drinks but this place is dangerous
theyre going to execute master luke and if were not careful us too
artoo whistles a singsong response
i wish i had your confidence
the convoy moves up over a huge sand pit
the sail barge stops to one side of the depression as does the escort skiff
but the prisoners skiff moves out directly over the center and hovers
at the bottom of the deep cone of sand is a repulsive mucous lined hole surrounded by thousands of needle sharp teeth
this is the sarlacc
a plank is extended from the edge of the prisoners skiff
guards release lukes bonds and shove him out onto the plank above the sarlaccs mouth
jabba and leia are now by the rail watching
threepio leans forward and the slobbering villain mumbles something to him
as threepio steps up to a comlink jabba raises his arm and the motley array of intergalactic pirates fall silent
threepios voice is amplified across loudspeakers
victims of the almighty sarlacc his excellency hopes that you will die honorably
but should any of you wish to beg for mercy the great jabba the hutt will now listen to your pleas
han steps forward arrogantly and begins to speak
threepio you tell that slimy piece of
worm ridden filth hell get no such pleasure from us
chewie growls his agreement
this is your last chance
free us or die
lando moves unobtrusively along the skiff as luke shoots a quick look of conspiracy to him
the assembled monsters rock with mocking laughter as artoo zips unnoticed up the ramp to the upper deck
jabbas laughter subsides as he speaks into the comlink
jabba in huttese subtitled move him into position
jabba makes a thumbs down gesture
leia looks worried
artoo appears from below and zips over to the rail facing the pit
below in the skiff luke is prodded by a guard to the edge of the plank over the gaping sarlacc
luke looks up at artoo then gives a jaunty salute the signal the little droid has been waiting for
a flap opens in artoos domed head
jabba in huttese subtitled put him in
luke is prodded and jumps off the plank to the cheers of the bloodthirsty spectators
but before anyone can even perceive what is happening he spins around and grabs the end of the plank by his fingertips
the plank bends wildly from his weight and catapults him skyward
in midair he does a complete flip and drops down on the end of the plank in the same spot he just vacated but facing the skiff
he casually extends an open palm and his lightsaber which artoo has sent arcing toward him drops into his hand
with samurai speed luke ignites it and attacks the guard who prodded him off the plank sending the hapless monster screaming overboard
the other guards swarm toward luke
he wades into them lightsaber flashing
lando struggles with another guard at the back of the skiff
a bewildered guard lands in the soft sandy slope of the pit and begins sliding
he claws desperately as a sarlacc tentacle grabs him and pulls him screaming into the viscous mouth
jabba watches this and explodes in rage
he barks commands and the guards around him rush off to do his bidding
the scuzzy creatures watching the action from the window are in an uproar
luke knocks another guard off the skiff and into the waiting mouth of the sarlacc
he starts to untie chewies bonds
at that moment the deck gunmen on the barge unleash a series of blasts from a big cannon on the upper deck
lando is tossed from the deck of the rocking skiff
he manages to grab a rope and dangles desperately above the sarlacc pit
with two swift strides the dangerous boba fett ignites his rocket pack leaps into the air and flies from the barge down to the skiff
boba lands on the skiff and starts to aim his laser gun at luke who has freed han and chewie from their bonds
but before boba can fire the young jedi spins on him lightsaber sweeping and hacks the bounty hunters gun in half
immediately the skiff takes another direct hit from the barges deck gun
shards of skiff deck fly
chewie and han are thrown against the rail
chewie you okay
where is he
the wookiee is wounded and he howls in pain
im okay pal
for a moment luke is distracted and in that moment boba fires a cable out of his armored sleeve
instantly luke is wrapped in a strong cable his arms pinned against his side his sword arm free only from the wrist down
luke bends his wrist so the lightsaber points straight up to reach the wire lasso and cuts through
luke shrugs away the cable and stands free
another blast from the barges deck gun hits near boba and he is knocked unconscious to the deck next to where lando is hanging
luke is a little shaken but remains standing as a fusillade brackets him
the second skiff loaded with guards firing their weapons moves in on luke fast
luke leaps toward the incoming second skiff
the young jedi leaps into the middle of the second skiff and begins decimating the guards from their midst
chewie wounded tries to lift himself as he barks directions to han guiding him toward a spear which has been dropped by one of the guards
han searches the deck as chewie barks directions finally he grabs hold of the spear
boba fett badly shaken rises from the deck
he looks over at the other skiff where luke is whipping a mass of guards
boba raises his arm and aims his lethal appendage
chewie barks desperately at han
the space pirate turns around blindly and the long spear in his hand whacks squarely in the middle of bobas rocket pack
the impact of the swing causes the rocket pack to ignite
boba blasts off flying over the second skiff like a missile smashing against the side of the huge sail barge and sliding away into the pit
he screams as his armored body makes its last flight past lando and directly into the mucous mouth of the sarlacc
the sarlacc burps
chewie growls a weak congratulations to han
leia turns from the spectacle outside leaps onto jabbas throne and throws the chain that enslaves her over his head around his bulbous neck
then she dives off the other side of the throne pulling the chain violently in her grasp
jabbas flaccid neck contracts beneath the tightening chain
his huge eyes bulge from their sockets and his scum coated tongue flops out
the exalted hutts huge tail spasms through its death throes and then slams down into final stillness
leia struggles to free herself of her bondage
luke continues to destroy the aliens on the guards skiff as han extends his spear downward to lando who is still dangling precariously from a rope on the prisoners skiff
lando grab it
a major hit from the barge deck gun knocks the skiff on its side
han and almost everything else on board slides overboard
the rope breaks and lando falls to the side of the sarlacc pit
luckily hans foot catches on the skiff railing and he dangles above lando and the pit
the wounded wookiee holds onto the skiff for dear life as another hit from the deck gun rocks the skiff violently
grab me chewie
chewie grabs hold of hans feet holding him upside down as han extends the spear toward lando who is clutching to the side of the pit
luke finishes off the last guard on the second skiff
he sees the deck gun blasting away at his helpless companions
luke leaps from the skiff across a chasm of air to the sheer metallic side of the sail barge
barely able to get a fingerhold he begins a painful climb up the hull when suddenly an ax smashes through a window an inch from his head
with jedi agility luke grasps the wrist holding the ax and yanks the helpless guard through the broken window and into the deadly pit
the injured chewie is reaching over the rail for the dangling han who is in turn blindly reaching down toward the desperate lando
the baron has stopped his slippage down the sandy slope of the sarlacc pit by lying very still
every time he tries to reach for han the loose sand moves him closer to his final reward
you almost got it
another blast hits the front of the tilted skiff causing lando to let go of the spear
again han extends the spear toward lando
now easy easy
hold me chewie
one of the sarlaccs tentacles has wrapped tightly around his ankle dragging him down the side of the pit
chewie give me the gun
dont move lando
i thought you were blind
its all right
a little higher
just a little higher
han adjusts his aim as lando lowers his head and the fuzzy eyed pirate fires at the tentacle
the tentacle releases lando and chewie starts to pull them on board the skiff
chewie pull us up
up chewie up
the deck gunners have chewie and the desperate dangling human chain in their gun sights when something up on deck commands their attention luke standing before them like a pirate
king ignites his lightsaber
the deck gunners have barely reached for their pistols before the young jedi has demolished them
immediately luke turns to see two more gunners who have been uncovering a giant gun at the end of the barge racing for him firing their laser pistols
leia is struggling against her chains in desperation as artoo zips through the tumult of confused monsters to the rescue the stubby little droid extends a small laser gun and
blasts the chain apart
we gotta get out of here quick
artoo and leia race for the exit passing threepio who is kicking and screaming as salacious crumb the reptilian monkey monster picks out one of the golden droids eyes
not my eyes
artoo zips over and zaps salacious sending him skyward with a scream crashing into the rafters as artoo leia and threepio with his eye dangling from a wire hurry off
luke is warding off laser blasts with his lightsaber surrounded by guards and fighting like a demon
leia emerges onto the deck as luke turns to face another guard
luke to leia get the gun
point it at the deck
leia turns toward the barge cannon climbs on the platform and swivels the gun around
point it at the deck
a laser blast hits lukes mechanical hand and he bends over in pain but manages to swing his lightsaber upward and take out the last of the guards
he looks at the wounded hand which reveals the mechanism
he flexes the hand it still works
near the rail of the upper deck artoo and threepio steady themselves as threepio gets ready to jump
artoo beeps wildly
artoo where are we going
i couldnt possibly jump
artoo butts the golden droid over the edge and steps off himself tumbling toward the sand
luke runs along the empty deck toward leia and the barge gun which she has brought around to point down at the deck
luke has hold on one of the rigging ropes from the mast
he gathers leia in his other arm and kicks the trigger of the deck gun
the gun explodes into the deck as luke and leia swing out toward the skiff
han leans panting against the rail as chewie helps lando onto the deck
luke and leia land on the skiff with flair
and dont forget the droids
were on our way
the sail barge is exploding in stages in the distance
half of the huge craft is on fire
threepios legs stick straight up from the dune where he landed
next to it artoos periscope is the only thing above the sand
the skiff floats above them and two large electromagnets dangle down on a wire
with a loud clang both droids are pulled from the sand
the little skiff skips around the burning sail barge which continues its chain of explosions
as the skiff sails off across the desert the barge settles to the sand and disappears in one final conflagration
a ferocious sandstorm blocks our view
then through the roar we hear the voices of our heroes
they emerge slowly from the veil of sand pressing on against the wind
first come artoo and threepio followed by leia guiding han then luke and lando come into view each supporting one side of the towering chewbacca who hobbles from his wound
soon they can make out some large vague shapes in the blowing sand
it is the millennium falcon and parked beside it lukes trusty x wing and a two seated y wing
they must shout to be heard
i dont know
all i can see is a lot of blowing sand
thats all any of us can see
han blinking then i guess im getting better
as soon as the group huddles under the bulk of the falcon the wind dies down to something more describable as a severe weather condition
threepio hits a switch and the gang plank lowers with a hum
han turning to luke ive got to hand it to you kid you were pretty good out there
luke shrugging it off i had a lot of help
think nothing of it
no im thinking a lot about it
that carbon freeze was the closest thing to dead there is
and it wasnt just sleepin
it was a big wide awake nothing
luke nods as chewie growls affectionately at the young jedi warrior mussing his hair like a proud uncle
and leia warmly hugs him
luke moving to his ship ill see you back at the fleet
why dont you leave that crate and come with us
i have a promise i have to keep first
to an old friend
luke and artoo take off in their spacecraft
looking dubiously at lando obviously remembering his friends betrayal and subsequent aide guess i owe you some thanks too lando
figured if i left you frozen like that youd just give me bad luck the rest of my life so i might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later
he means youre welcome
come on lets get off this miserable dust ball
the desolate yellow planet fills the screen lukes x wing appears and peels off to the left
a moment later the falcon appears as a dot and grows huge to roar directly over the camera
luke is at the controls with artoo attached behind him outside the canopy
luke speaks into his comlink to the others in the millennium ill meet you back at the fleet
leia over comlink hurry
the alliance should be assembled by now
han over comlink hey luke thanks
thanks for comin after me
now i owe you one
a message from artoo appears on the small monitor screen in front of luke
he smiles at the monitor and speaks to artoo as he pulls a black glove on to cover his wounded mechanical hand
thats right artoo
were going to the dagobah system
i have a promise to keep
to an old friend
a super star destroyer and several ships of the imperial fleet rest in space above the half completed death star and its green neighbor endor
four squads of tie fighters escort an imperial shuttle toward the death star
lord vader strides down the hallway accompanied by a very nervous death star commander
thousands of imperial troops in tight formation fill the mammoth docking bay
vader and the officer walk to the landing platform where the shuttle is coming to rest
the shuttles ramp lowers and the emperors royal guards come out and create a lethal perimeter
the assembled troops move to rigid attention with a momentous snap
then in the huge silence which follows the emperor appears
he is a rather small shriveled old man
his bent frame slowly makes its way down the ramp with the aid of a gnarled cane
he wears a hooded cloak similar to the one ben wears except that it is black
the emperors face is shrouded and difficult to see except for his piercing yellow eyes
commander jerjerrod and darth vader kneel to him
the supreme ruler of the galaxy beckons to the dark lord
emperor to vader rise my friend
vader rises and falls in next to the emperor as he slowly makes his way along the rows of troops
jerjerrod and the other commanders stay kneeling until the supreme ruler and vader followed by several imperial dignitaries pass by only then do they join in the procession
the death star will be completed on schedule
you have done well lord vader
and now i sense you wish to continue your search for young skywalker
yes my master
patience my friend
in time he will seek you out
and when he does you must bring him before me
he has grown strong
only together can we turn him to the dark side of the force
as you wish
everything is proceeding as i have foreseen
he laughs to himself as they pass along the vast line of imperial troops
once again artoo finds himself waiting around in the damp environs of the swamp planet and hes none too happy about it
he beeps disconsolately to himself and turns to look at yodas cottage
warm yellow light escapes the oddly shaped windows to fight the gloom
the tip of a walking stick taps hesitantly across the earthen floor of the cottage
our view travels up the stick to the small green hand that clutches it and then to the familiar face of yoda the jedi master
his manner is frail and his voice though cheerful seems weaker
that face you make
look i so old to young eyes
luke is sitting in a corner of the cramped space and indeed his look has been woeful
caught he tries to hide it
of course not
yoda tickled chuckles i do yes i do
sick have i become
old and weak
points a crooked finger when nine hundred years old you reach look as good you will not
yoda chuckles at this coughs and hobbles over toward his bed
soon will i rest
yes forever sleep
earned it i have
yoda sits himself on his bed with great effort
master yoda you cant die
strong am i with the force
but not that strong
twilight is upon me and soon night must fall
that is the way of things
the way of the force
but i need your help
ive come back to complete the training
no more training do you require
already know you that which you need
yoda sighs and lies back on his bed
then i am a jedi
yoda shakes his head ohhh
one thing remains vader
you must confront vader
then only then a jedi will you be
and confront him you will
luke is in agony
he is silent for a long moment screwing up his courage
finally he is able to ask
is darth vader my father
yodas eyes are full of weariness and compassion
an odd sad smile creases his face
he turns painfully on his side away from luke
rest i need
luke watches him each moment an eternity
yoda i must know
your father he is
luke reacts as if cut
told you did he
a new look of concern crosses yodas face
he closes his eyes
unexpected this is and unfortunate
unfortunate that i know the truth
yoda opens his eyes again and studies the youth
yoda gathering all his strength no
unfortunate that you rushed to face him
that incomplete was your training
not ready for the burden were you
well im sorry
remember a jedis strength flows from the force
anger fear aggression
the dark side are they
once you start down the dark path forever will it dominate your destiny
he beckons the young jedi closer to him
do not underestimate the powers of the emperor or suffer your fathers fate you will
luke when gone am i cough the last of the jedi will you be
luke the force runs strong in your family
pass on what you have learned luke
with great effort there is
he catches his breath
a shiver runs through the ancient green creature and he dies
luke stares at his dead master as he disappears in front of his eyes
luke wanders back to where his ship is sitting
artoo beeps a greeting but is ignored by his depressed master
luke kneels down begins to help artoo with the ship then stops and shakes his head dejectedly
i cant do it artoo
i cant go on alone
yoda will always be with you
luke looks up to see the shimmering image of ben kenobi
why didnt you tell me
the ghost of ben kenobi approaches him through the swamp
you told me vader betrayed and murdered my father
you father was seduced by the dark side of the force
he ceased to be anakin skywalker and became darth vader
when that happened the good man who was your father was destroyed
so what i have told you was true
from a certain point of view
luke turning away derisive a certain point of view
luke youre going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view
luke is unresponsive
ben studies him in silence for a moment
i dont blame you for being angry
if i was wrong in what i did it certainly wouldnt have been for the first time
you see what happened to your father was my fault
ben pauses sadly
anakin was a good friend
luke turns with interest at this
as ben speaks luke settles on a stump mesmerized
artoo comes over to offer his comforting presence
when i first knew him your father was already a great pilot
but i was amazed how strongly the force was with him
i took it upon myself to train him as a jedi
i thought that i could instruct him just as well as yoda
i was wrong
my pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy
luke is entranced
theres still good in him
i also thought he could be turned back to the good side
it couldnt be done
he is more machine now than man
twisted and evil
i cant do it ben
you cannot escape your destiny
i tried to stop him once
i couldnt do it
vader humbled you when first you met him luke
but that experience was part of your training
it taught you among other things the value of patience
had you not been so impatient to defeat vader then you could have finished your training here with yoda
you would have been prepared
but i had to help my friends
ben grinning at lukes indignation and did you help them
it was they who had to save you
you achieved little by rushing back prematurely i fear
luke with sadness i found out darth vader was my father
to be a jedi luke you must confront and then go beyond the dark side the side your father couldnt get past
impatience is the easiest door for you like your father
only your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door and you have held firm
youre no longer so reckless now luke
you are strong and patient
and now you must face darth vader again
i cant kill my own father
then the emperor has already won
you were our only hope
yoda spoke of another
the other he spoke of is your twin sister
but i have no sister
to protect you both from the emperor you were hidden from your father when you were born
the emperor knew as i did if anakin were to have any offspring they would be a threat to him
that is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous
leias my sister
your insight serves you well
bury your feelings deep down luke
they do you credit
but they could be made to serve the emperor
luke looks into the distance trying to comprehend all this
ben continuing his narrative when your father left he didnt know your mother was pregnant
your mother and i knew he would find out eventually but we wanted to keep you both as safe as possible for as long as possible
so i took you to live with my brother owen on tatooine
and your mother took leia to live as the daughter of senator organa on alderaan
luke turns and settles near ben to hear the tale
ben attempting to give solace with his words the organa household was high born and politically quite powerful in that system
leia became a princess by virtue of lineage
no one knew shed been adopted of course
but it was a title without real power since alderaan had long been a democracy
even so the family continued to be politically powerful and leia following in her foster fathers path became a senator as well
thats not all she became of course
she became the leader of her cell in the alliance against the corrupt empire
and because she had diplomatic immunity she was a vital link for getting information to the rebel cause
thats what she was doing when her path crossed yours
for her foster parents had always told her to contact me on tatooine if her troubles became desperate
luke is overwhelmed by the truth and is suddenly protective of his sister
but you cant let her get involved now ben
vader will destroy her
she hasnt been trained in the ways of the jedi the way you have luke
but the force is strong with her as it is with all of your family
there is no avoiding the battle
you must face and destroy vader
the vast rebel fleet stretches as far as the eye can see
overhead a dozen small corellian battleships fly in formation
fighters and battlecruisers surround the largest of the rebel star cruisers the hundreds of rebel commanders of all races and forms are assembled in the war room
wedge is among them
in the center of the room is a holographic model depicting the half completed imperial death star the nearby moon of endor and the protecting deflector shield
mon mothma the leader of the alliance enters the room
she is a stern but beautiful woman in her fifties
conferring with her are several military leaders including general madine and admiral ackbar a salmon colored mon calamari
lando moves through the crowd until he finds han and chewie standing next to leia and the two droids
han peers at landos new insignia on his chest and is amused
well look at you a general huh
oh well someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of taanab
han sarcastic well dont look at me pal
i just said you were a fair pilot
i didnt know they were lookin for somebody to lead this crazy attack
lando smiling im surprised they didnt ask you to do it
well who says they didnt
but i aint crazy
youre the respectable one remember
mon mothma signals for attention and the room falls silent
the emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has come
this causes a stir
mon mothma turns to a holographic model of the death star the endor moon and the protecting deflector shield in the center of the room
the data brought to us by the bothan spies pinpoints the exact location of the emperors new battle station
we also know that the weapon systems of this death star are not yet operational
with the imperial fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us it is relatively unprotected
but most important of all weve learned that the emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this death star
a volley of spirited chatter erupts from the crowd
han turns to leia as chewie barks his amazement
mon mothma cont many bothans died to bring us this information
admiral ackbar please
admiral ackbar steps forward and points to the death stars force field and the moon of endor
you can see here the death star orbiting the forest moon of endor
although the weapon systems on this death star are not yet operational the death star does have a strong defense mechanism
it is protected by an energy shield which is generated from the nearby forest moon of endor
the shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted
once the shield is down our cruisers will create a perimeter while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor
theres a concerned murmur
ackbar cont general calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack han turns to lando with a look of respect
lando nods his thanks
youre gonna need it
madine moves center stage
we have stolen a small imperial shuttle
disguised as a cargo ship and using a secret imperial code a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator
the assembly begins to mumble among themselves
leia to han i wonder who they found to pull that off
general solo is your strike team assembled
leia startled looks up at han surprise changing to admiration
uh my teams ready
i dont have a command crew for the shuttle
chewbacca raises his hairy paw and volunteers
han looks up at him
well its gonna be rough pal
i didnt want to speak for you
chewie waves that off with a huge growl
han smiles thats one
count me in
im with you too
they turn in that direction and peer into the crowd as there are more cheers
the commanders part and there at the back stands luke
han and leia are surprised and delighted
leia moves to luke and embraces him warmly
she senses a change in him and looks into his eyes questioningly
what is it
luke hesitant ask me again sometime
han chewie and lando crowd around luke as the assembly breaks up
artoo beeps a singsong observation to a worried threepio
exciting is hardly the word i would use
the millennium falcon rests beyond the stolen imperial shuttle which looks anomalous among all the rebel ships in the vast docking bay
chewie barks a final farewell to lando and leads artoo and threepio up the shuttle crowded now with the rebel strike team loading weapons and supplies
lando turns to face han
luke and leia have said their good byes and start up the ramp
i want you to take her
i mean it
you need all the help you can get
shes the fastest ship in the fleet
all right old buddy
you know i know what she means to you
ill take good care of her
she she wont get a scratch
han looks at him warmly right
i got your promise now
not a scratch
look would you get going you pirate
han and lando pause then exchange salutes
han goes up the ramp
lando watches him go and then slowly turns away
luke is working on a back control panel as han comes in and takes the pilots seat
chewie in the seat next to him is trying to figure out all the imperial controls
you got her warmed
yeah shes comin up
chewie growls a complaint
i dont think the empire had wookiees in mind when they designed her chewie
leia comes in from the hold and takes her seat near luke
chewie barks and hits some switches
hans glance has stuck on something out the window the millennium falcon
leia nudges him gently
hey are you awake
yeah i just got a funny feeling
like im not gonna see her again
chewie hearing this stops his activity and looks longingly out at the falcon too
leia puts a hand on hans shoulder
leia softly come on general lets move
han snaps back to life
chewie lets see what this piece of junk can do
here we go again
all right hang on
the stolen imperial shuttle leaves the main docking bay of the headquarters frigate lowers its wings into flight position and zooms off into space
the converted control room is dimly lit except for a pool of light at the far end
there the emperor sits in an elaborate control chair before a large window which looks out across the half completed death star to the giant green moon of endor
darth vader standing with other members of the imperial council cautiously approaches his master
the rulers back is to vader
after several tense moments the emperors chair rotates around to face him
what is thy bidding my master
send the fleet to the far side of endor
there it will stay until called for
what of the reports of the rebel fleet massing near sullust
it is of no concern
soon the rebellion will be crushed and young skywalker will be one of us
your work here is finished my friend
go out to the command ship and await my orders
yes my master
vader bows then turns and exits the throne room as the emperor walks toward the waiting council members
there is a great deal of imperial traffic in the area as construction proceeds on the death star
transports tie fighters and a few star destroyers move about
now the huge super star destroyer announces itself with a low roar and soon fills the frame
han looks back at luke and leia as chewie flips several switches
through the viewscreen the death star and the huge super star destroyer can be seen
if they dont go for this were gonna have to get outta here pretty quick chewie
chewie growls his agreement
controller over radio we have you on our screen now
shuttle tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield
controller over radio shuttle tydirium transmit the clearance code for shield passage
leia and chewbacca listen tensely as the sound of a high speed transmission begins
now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid
chewie whines nervously
luke stares at the huge super star destroyer that looms ever larger before them
vaders on that ship
now dont get jittery luke
there are a lot of command ships
keep your distance though chewie but dont look like youre trying to keep your distance
chewie barks a question
i dont know
im endangering the mission
i shouldnt have come
its your imagination kid
lets keep a little optimism here
chewie barks his worries as the super star destroyer grows larger out the window
lord vader stands back to us staring out a window at the death star
now some vibration felt only by him causes him to turn
after a moment of stillness he walks down the row of controllers to where admiral piett is leaning over the tracking screen of the controller weve seen earlier
piett straightens at vaders approach
where is that shuttle going
piett into comlink shuttle tydirium what is your cargo and destination
pilot voice han filtered parts and technical crew for the forest moon
the bridge commander looks to vader for a reaction
do they have a code clearance
its an older code sir but it checks out
i was about to clear them
vader looks upward as he senses lukes presence
shall i hold them
leave them to me
i will deal with them myself
piett surprised as you wish my lord
to controller carry on
piett nods at controller who switches on his comlink
the group waits tensely
theyre not goin for it chewie
controller filtered shuttle tydirium deactivation of the shield will commence immediately
follow your present course
everyone breaths a sigh of relief
everyone but luke who looks worried
i told you it was gonna work
the stolen imperial shuttle moves off toward the green sanctuary moon
the stolen imperial shuttle sits in a clearing of the moons dark primeval forest dwarfed by the ancient towering trees
on an adjacent hill the helmeted rebel contingent makes its way up a steep trail
leia and han are slightly ahead of chewie and luke
the troops of the strike team squad follow with artoo and threepio bringing up the rear
up ahead chewie and leia reach a crest in the hill and drop suddenly to the ground signaling the rest of the group to stop
han and luke crawl up to take a look
oh i told you it was dangerous here
not far below them two imperial scouts are wandering through bushes in the valley below
their two rocket bikes are parked nearby
shall we try and go around
itll take time
this whole partyll be for nothing if they see us
leia motions for the squad to stay put then she han luke and chewie start quietly down
the four friends make their way to the edge of the clearing not far from the two imperial scouts
chewie and i will take care of this
you stay here
quietly there might be more of them out there
han grins hey
han and chewie turn and start through the bushes toward the scouts
luke and leia exchange smiles
han sneaks up behind one of the scouts steps on a twig and the scout whirls knocking han into a tree
the scout shouts for his companion
go for help
the second scout jumps on his speeder bike and takes off but chewie gets off a shot on his crossbow laser weapon causing the scout to crash into a tree
han and scout are in a rousing fistfight
luke sarcastic great
luke starts for the scuffle followed by leia with her laser pistol drawn
as they run through the bushes leia stops and points to where two more scouts are sitting on their speeder bikes with an unoccupied bike parked nearby
two more of them
i see them
but leia doesnt hear him and races for the remaining speeder bike
she starts it up and takes off as luke jumps on the bike behind her
luke pointing to the controls quick
jam their comlink
luke and leia speed into the dense foliage in hot pursuit barely avoiding two huge trees
he flips the remaining scout to the ground
the two fleeing imperial scouts have a good lead as luke and leia pursue through the giant trees at miles an hour the fire from their bikes laser cannon hitting
harmlessly near the moving targets
leia guns it closing the gap as the two scouts recklessly veer through a narrow gap in the trees
one of the bikes scrapes a tree slowing the scout
get alongside that one
leia pulls her speeder bike up so close to the scouts bike that their steering vanes scrape noisily
luke leaps from his bike to the back of the scouts grabs the imperial warrior around the neck and flips him off the bike into a thick tree trunk
luke gains control of the bike and follows leia who has pulled ahead
they tear off after the remaining scout
the speeding chase passes two more imperial scouts
these two swing into pursuit chasing luke and leia firing away with their laser cannon
the two rebels look behind them just as lukes bike takes a glancing hit
luke indicating the one ahead keep on that one
ill take these two
with leia shooting ahead luke suddenly slams his steering vanes into the braking mode
lukes bike is a blur to the two pursuing scouts as they zip by him on either side
luke slams his bike into forward and starts firing away having switched places with his pursuers in a manner of seconds
lukes aim is good and one scouts bike is blasted out of control
it explodes against a tree trunk
the scouts cohort takes one glance back at the flash and shifts into turbo drive going even faster
luke keeps on his tail
far ahead leia and the first scout are doing a highspeed slalom through the death dealing trunks
now leia aims her bike skyward and rises out of sight
the scout turns in confusion unable to see his pursuer
suddenly leia dives down upon him from above cannon blasting
the scouts bike takes a glancing hit
leia moves in alongside him
the scout eyes her beside him reaches down and pulls out a handgun
before leia can react the scout has blasted her bike sending it out of control
leia dives off as her bike explodes against a tree
the happy scout looks back at the explosion
but when he turns forward again he is on a collision course with a giant fallen tree
he hits his brakes to no avail and disappears in a conflagration
another part of the forest luke and the last remaining scout continue their weaving chase through the trees
now luke moves up close
the scout responds by slamming his bike into lukes
a fallen tree forms a bridge across their path
the scout zips under
luke goes over the top and crashes his bike down on the scouts
both riders look ahead a wide trunk looms directly in lukes path but the scouts bike beside him makes it almost impossible for him to avoid it
luke banks with all his might leaning almost horizontal over the scouts bike and is able to make it by just clipping the tree
when he straightens he and the scout discover that their two bikes have locked front vanes and are moving as one
another big tree looms in lukes path
he reacts instinctively and dives off his bike
the two bikes come apart a second before lukes explodes against a tree
the scout sweeps out and circles back to find luke
luke rises from the undergrowth as the scout bears down on him and opens fire with his laser cannon
luke ignites his laser sword and begins deflecting the bolts
the scouts bike keeps coming and it appears that in a second it will cut luke in half
at the last instant luke steps aside and chops off the bikes control vanes with one mighty slash
the scouts bike begins to shudder then pitching and rolling it rises up to slam directly into a tree in a giant ball of fire
han chewie and the droids along with the rest of the squad wait anxiously in the clearing
artoos radar screen sticks out of his domed head and revolves scanning the forest
oh general solo somebodys coming
han chewie and the rest of the squad raise their weapons
luke steps out of the foliage to find the weapons trained on him
hes too tired to care
he plops himself down on a boulder and looks around
luke concerned what
she didnt come back
i thought she was with you
we got separated
luke and han exchange a silent grim look
luke gets up wearily
hey we better go look for her
han nods and signals to a rebel officer
take the squad ahead
well meet at the shield generator at
come on artoo
well need your scanners
luke chewie han and the droids move off in one direction as the squad proceeds in another
dont worry master luke
we know what to do
they move off into the woods
threepio to artoo and you said it was pretty here
a strange little furry face with huge black eyes comes slowly into view
the creature is an ewok by the name of wicket
he seems somewhat puzzled and prods leia with a spear
the princess groans this frightens the stubby ball of fuzz and he prods her again
leia sits up and stares at the three foot high ewok
she tries to figure out where she is and what has happened
her clothes are torn shes bruised and disheveled
the ewok jumps up and grabs a four foot long spear which he holds in a defensive position
leia watches him as he circles warily and begins poking her with the sharp point of the spear
cut it out
she stands up and the ewok quickly backs away
im not gonna hurt you
leia looks around at the dense forest and at the charred remains of her speeder bike then sits down with a sigh on a fallen log
well looks like im stuck here
trouble is i dont know where here is
she puts her head in her hands to rub away some of the soreness from her fall
she looks over at the watchful little ewok and pats the log beside her
well maybe you can help me
come on sit down
wicket holds his spear up warily and growls at her like a puppy
leia pats the log again
i promise i wont hurt you
now come here
more growls and squeaks from the little bear creature
you want something to eat
she takes a scrap of food out of her pocket and offers it to him
wicket takes a step backward then cocks his head and moves cautiously toward leia chattering in his squeaky ewok language
sniffing the food curiously the ewok comes toward leia and sits on the log beside her
she takes off her helmet and the little creature jumps back startled again
he runs along the log pointing his spear at her and chattering a blue streak
leia holds out the helmet to him
look its a hat
its not gonna hurt you
youre a jittery little thing arent you
reassured wicket lowers his spear and climbs back on the log coming to investigate the helmet
suddenly his ears perk up and he begins to sniff the air
he looks around warily whispering some ewokese warning to leia
what is it
suddenly a laser bolt comes out of the foliage and explodes on the log next to leia
leia and wicket both roll backwards off the log hiding behind it
leia holds her own laser gun ready while wicket disappears underneath the log
another shot and still no sight of anyone in the forest
then leia senses something and turns to find a large imperial scout standing over her with his weapon pointed at her head
he reaches out his hand for her weapon
scout l freeze
come on get up
she hands the weapon over as a second scout emerges from the foliage in front of the log
go get your ride and take her back to base
the second scout starts toward his bike as wicket crouched under the log extends his spear and hits the first scout on the leg
the scout jumps and lets out an exclamation and looks down at wicket puzzled
leia grabs a branch and knocks him out
she dives for his laser pistol and the second scout now on his bike takes off
leia fires away and hits the escaping bike causing it to crash into the first scouts bike which flies end over end and explodes
the forest is quiet once more
wicket pokes his fuzzy head up from behind the log and regards leia withenew respect
he mumbles his awe
leia hurries over looking around all the time and motions the chubby little creature into the dense foliage
come on lets get outta here
as they move into the foliage wicket takes the lead
he shrieks and tugs at leia to follow him
darth vader walks down the corridor to the emperors tower and private elevator
the emperors private guard steps in vaders path
the emperor does not wish to be disturbed at the moment
raising his gloved hand to the two guards and choking them with the force the emperor will see me now
repeating vaders command the emperor will see you now
two red imperial guards stand watch at the elevator as the door opens to reveal vader
vader enters the eerie foreboding throne room
it appears to be empty
his footsteps echo as he approaches the throne
he waits absolutely still
the emperor sits with his back to the dark lord
i told you to remain on the command ship
a small rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on endor
emperor no surprise yes i know
vader after a beat my son is with them
emperor very cool are you sure
i have felt him my master
strange that i have not
i wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear lord vader
vader knows what is being asked
they are clear my master
then you must go to the sanctuary moon and wait for them
vader skeptical he will come to me
i have foreseen it
his compassion for you will be his undoing
he will come to you and then you will bring him before me
vader bows as you wish
the dark lord strides out of the throne room
han luke chewie and the two droids are spread out as they move through the heavy foliage near the clearing where we last saw leia
luke finds leias helmet picks it up with an expression of concern
luke runs with the helmet to where han has found the charred wreckage of a speeder bike in the grass
oh master luke
theres two more wrecked speeders back there
and i found this
he tosses the helmet to han
im afraid that artoos sensors can find no trace of princess leia
han gravely i hope shes alright
chewbacca growls sniffing the air then with a bark pushes off through the foliage
the others rush to keep up with the giant wookiee
as he scoots along artoo whistles nervously
the group has reached a break in the undergrowth
chewie walks up to a tall stake planted in the ground
there is a dead animal hanging from it
hey i dont get it
the rest of the group joins the wookiee around the stake
han cont nah its just a dead animal chewie
chewie cant resist
he reaches toward the meat
chewie wa wait
the wookiee has already pulled the animal from the stake
the group finds itself hanging upside down in an ewok net suspended high above the clearing
artoo lets out a wild series of beeps and whistles and chewie howls his regret
their bodies are a jumble in the net
han removes a wookiee paw from his mouth
always thinking with your stomach
will you take it easy
lets just figure out a way to get out of this thing
trying to free an arm han can you reach my lightsaber
artoo is at the bottommost point in the net
he extends his cutting appendage and begins slicing at the net
han is trying to squeeze an arm past threepio to get at lukes lightsaber
the net continues to spin
artoo im not sure thats such a good idea
its a very long dro o op
artoo has cut through and the entire group tumbles out of the net crashing to the ground
as they regain their senses and sit up they realize they are surrounded by dozens of ewoks each brandishing a long spear
point that thing someplace else
han pushes the spear wielded by teebo out of his face and a second ewok warrior comes up to argue with teebo
the spear returns to hans face
he grabs it angrily and starts to go for his laser pistol
itll be all right
the ewoks swarm through them and confiscate their weapons
luke lets them take his lightsaber
chewie growls at the furry critters
chewie give em your crossbow
artoo and threepio are just untangling themselves
threepio gets free of the net and sits up rattled
oh my head
oh my goodness
when the ewoks see threepio they let out a gasp and chatter among themselves
threepio speaks to them in their native tongue
the ewok nearest him drops his spear and prostrates himself before the droid
in a moment all the ewoks have followed suit
chewie lets out a puzzled bark
han and luke regard the bowed creatures in wonder
the ewoks begin to chant at threepio
do you understand anything theyre saying
oh yes master luke
remember that i am fluent in over six million forms of communication
what are you telling them
hello i think
i could be mistaken
theyre using a very primitive dialect
but i do believe they think i am some sort of god
chewbacca and artoo think thats very funny
han and luke exchange what next
well why dont you use your divine influence and get us out of this
i beg your pardon general solo but that just wouldnt be proper
its against my programming to impersonate a deity
han moves toward threepio threateningly
why you several ewoks spears are thrust in hans face at the affront to their god
the ewoks move in to protect their god and han is surrounded by a menacing circle of spears all aimed at him
he holds up his hands placatingly
hes an old friend of mine
a procession of ewoks winds through the ever darkening forest
their prisoners han luke chewie and artoo are tied to long poles and wrapped in vines cocoonlike
each pole is carried on the shoulders of several ewoks
behind the captives threepio is carried on a litter like a king by the remaining creatures
the procession moves along a shaky narrow wooden walkway high in the giant trees
it stops at the end of the walkway which drops off into nothingness
on the other side of the abyss is a village of mud huts and rickety walkways attached to the giant trees
the lead ewok takes hold of a long vine and swings across to the village square the other ewoks follow suit
the procession winds its way into the village square
mother ewoks gather their babies up and scurry into their huts at the sight of the newcomers
the group stops before the largest hut
han luke chewie and artoo are still bound to their poles
han is placed on a spit above what looks like a barbecue pit and the others are leaned against a tree nearby
threepios litter throne is gently placed near the pit
he watches with rapt fascination
han luke and chewie are less than fascinated
i have a really bad feeling about this
chewie growls his concern
suddenly all activity stops as logray the tribal medicine man comes out of the big hut
he examines the captives carefully goes to join threepio whose throne has been placed on an elevated platform
a larger gray haired ewok chief chirpa is examining lukes lightsaber with great curiosity
logray speaks to threepio and the assemblage of fuzzy ewoks pointing to the prisoners tied to the stakes
the ewoks begin filling the pit under han with firewood
what did he say
im rather embarrassed general solo but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor
the drums start beating and all the furry heads turn to the large hut
leia emerges wearing an animal skin dress
she sees whats happening at the same moment the prisoners see her
han and luke leia
as she moves toward them the ewoks block her way with raised spears
your royal highness
artoo and chewie chime in with their welcome
leia looks at the assembled ewoks and sighs
but these are my friends
threepio tell them they must be set free
threepio talks to chirpa and logray who listen and shake their heads negatively
the medicine man gestures toward the prisoners and barks some orders
several ewoks jump up and pile more wood on the barbecue with vigor
leia trades frantic looks with luke and han
somehow i got the feeling that didnt help us very much
threepio tell them if they dont do as you wish youll become angry and use your magic
but master luke what magic
i couldnt possibly just tell them
threepio speaks to the ewoks
the ewoks are disturbed
logray steps forward and challenges threepio
luke closes his eyes and begins to concentrate
you see master luke they didnt believe me
now the litter throne with threepio sitting upon it rises from the ground
at first threepio doesnt notice and keeps talking
as i said they wouldnt
wha wha whats happening
the ewoks fall back in terror from the floating throne
now threepio begins to spin as though he were on a revolving stool with threepio calling out in total panic at his situation
put me down
he e elp
somebody somebody help
master luke artoo
do something somebody
chief chirpa yells orders to the cowering ewoks
they rush up and release the bound prisoners
luke and han enfold leia in a group embrace
luke notices the spinning threepio with artoo beeping up at him and slowly lowers the golden droid and the throne to the ground
logray orders the little droid cut down
artoo crashes to the ground
when the ewoks set him upright the little droid is fighting mad
artoo beeps a blue streak at the nearest ewok and begins pursuing him finally getting close enough to zap him with an electric charge
the ewok jumps two feet in the air and runs away screaming
a small group of ewoks surround the giant wookiee scratching their heads and marveling at his height
oh oh oh oh
threepio still shaken i
i never knew i had it in me
a glowing fire dances in the center of the spartan low ceilinged room creating a kaleidoscope of shadows on the walls
along one side a group of ten ewok elders flank chief chirpa who sits on his throne
the rebels sit along the walls of the hut with threepio between the two groups and wicket and teebo off to one side
threepio is in the midst of a long animated speech in the ewoks squeaky native tongue
the ewoks listen carefully and occasionally murmur comments to each other
threepio points several times at the rebel group and pantomimes a short history of the galactic civil war mimicking the explosion and rocket sounds imitating imperial walkers
throughout the long account certain familiar names are distinguishable in english princess leia artoo darth vader death star jedi obi wan kenobi
artoo begins beeping excitedly at threepio
i was just coming to that
threepio continues with millennium falcon cloud city vader han solo carbonite sarlacc bringing the history up to the present time
at the end of it the chief logray and the elders confer then nod in agreement
the chief stands and makes a pronouncement
the drums begin to sound and all the ewoks stand with a great cheer and screeches
whats going on
i dont know
luke has been sharing the joy with smiling visage but now something passes like a dark cloud through his consciousness
the others do not notice
we are now a part of the tribe
several of the little teddy bears run up and hug the rebels
just what i always wanted
chewbacca is being enthusiastically embraced by an ewok while wicket clings to hans leg
han chuckles well short help is better than no help at all chewie
to wicket thank you
he says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator
luke has drifted to the back of the hut
now he wanders outside into the moonlight
leia notices and follows
how far is it
we need some fresh supplies too
and try and get our weapons back
han pulls threepio back as he keeps trying to translate
han cont and hurry up will ya
i havent got all day
the walkway is deserted now
the windows of the little huts glow and flicker from the fires inside
the sounds of the forest fill the soft night air
luke has wandered away from the chiefs hut and stands staring up at the death star
leia finds him like that
luke whats wrong
luke turns and looks at her a long moment
do you remember your mother
your real mother
just a little bit
she died when i was very young
what do you remember
a little surprised at his insistence she was very beautiful
looks up why are you asking me all this
he looks away
i have no memory of my mother
i never knew her
luke tell me
whats troubling you
vader is here
now on this moon
leia alarmed how do you know
i felt his presence
hes come for me
he can feel when im near
thats why i have to go
facing her as long as i stay im endangering the group and our mission here
beat i have to face him
leia is distraught confused
luke moves close and his manner is gentle
and very calm
hes my father
it wont be easy for you to hear it but you must
if i dont make it back youre the only hope for the alliance
leia is very disturbed by this
she moves away as if to deny it
luke dont talk that way
you have a power i i dont understand and could never have
youre wrong leia
you have that power too
in time youll learn to use it as i have
the force is strong in my family
my father has it
i have it
my sister has it
leia stares into his eyes
what she sees there frightens her
but she doesnt draw away
she begins to understand
its you leia
ive always known
then you know why i have to face him
luke run away far away
if he can feel your presence then leave this place
i wish i could go with you
no you dont
youve always been strong
but why must you confront him
there is good in him
ive felt it
he wont turn me over to the emperor
i can save him
i can turn him back to the good side
i have to try
they hold each other close and look at each other brother and sister
leia holds back her tears as luke slowly lets her go and moves away
he disappears onto the walkway that leads out of the village
leia bathed in moonlight watches him go as han comes out of the chiefs hut and comes over to her
leia is crying her body trembling
he realizes only now that she is crying
hey whats goin on
leia attempts to stifle her sobs and wipes her eyes
i just want to be alone for a little while
han angry nothing
come on tell me
whats goin on
she looks up at him struggling to control herself
i cant tell you
han loses his temper did you tell luke
is that who you could tell
he starts to walk away exasperated then stops and walks back to her
han gathers her tightly in his protective embrace
an imperial shuttle floats down from the death star and lands gracefully on the huge platform
now an imperial walker approaches the platform from the darkness of the forest
the whole outpost platform walkers military looks particularly offensive in the midst of this verdant beauty
darth vader walks down the ramp of the shuttle onto the platform into an elevator and appears on a ramp on a lower level
he walks toward another ramp exit and is met by two troopers and a commander with luke in binders at their center
the young jedi gazes at vader with complete calm
this is a rebel that surrendered to us
although he denies it i believe there may be more of them and i request permission to conduct a further search of the area
the commander extends his hand revealing lukes lightsaber
he was armed only with this
vader looks at luke turns away and faces the commander taking the lightsaber from the commanders hand
good work commander
conduct your search and bring his companions to me
yes my lord
the officer and troops withdraw
vader and luke are left standing alone in the oddly tranquil beauty of the place
the sounds of the forest filter in upon them
the emperor has been expecting you
i know father
so you have accepted the truth
ive accepted the truth that you were once anakin skywalker my father
vader turning to face him that name no longer has any meaning for me
it is the name of your true self
youve only forgotten
i know there is good in you
the emperor hasnt driven it from you fully
that is why you couldnt destroy me
thats why you wont bring me to your emperor now
vader looks down from luke to the lightsaber in his own black gloved hand
he seems to ponder lukes words
vader indicating lightsaber i see you have constructed a new lightsaber
vader ignites the lightsaber and holds it to examine its humming brilliant blade
your skills are complete
indeed you are powerful as the emperor has foreseen
they stand for a moment the vader extinguishes the lightsaber
come with me
obi wan once thought as you do
luke steps close to vader then stops
vader is still
you dont know the power of the dark side
i must obey my master
i will not turn
and youll be forced to kill me
if that is your destiny
search your feelings father
you cant do this
i feel the conflict within you
let go of your hate
it is too late for me son
the emperor will show you the true nature of the force
he is your master now
vader signals to some distant stormtroopers
he and luke stand staring at one another for a long moment
then my father is truly dead
han leia chewbacca the droids wicket and another ewok scout paploo hide on a ridge overlooking the massive imperial shield generator
at the base of the generator is an imperial landing platform
leia studies the installation
the main entrance to the control bunkers on the far side of that landing platform
this isnt gonna be easy
hey dont worry
chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this
wicket and paploo are chattering away in ewok language
they speak to threepio
whats he saying
he says theres a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge
the vast fleet hangs in space near a blue planet
a giant rebel star cruiser is up at the front but now the millennium flacon roars up to a spot ahead of it tiny in comparison
lando is in the pilot seat
his alien copilot nien nunb takes some getting used to in the familiar environs of the falcons cockpit
lando speaks into his comlink
admiral were in position
all fighters accounted for
proceed with the countdown
all groups assume attack coordinates
lando turns to his weird copilot
dont worry my friends are down there
theyll have that shield down on time
to himself or thisll be the shortest offensive of all time
the copilot flips some switches and grunts an alien comment
all craft prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark
he pulls a lever and the stars outside begin to streak
we are treated to an awesome sight first the millennium falcon then ackbars star cruiser then in large segments the huge fleet roars into hyperspace
han leia chewie the droids and their two ewok guides wicket and paploo have reunited with the rebel strike squad
the entire group is spread through the thick undergrowth
below them is the bunker that leads into the generator
four imperial scouts their speeder bikes parked nearby keep watch over the bunker entrance
chewie growls an observation and paploo chatters away to han in ewok language
back door huh
wicket and paploo continue their ewok conversation
han cont its only a few guards
this shouldnt be too much trouble
well it only takes one to sound the alarm
han with self confident grin then well do it real quiet like
threepio explains what is going on to wicket and paploo
the ewoks chatter a moment between themselves
then paploo jumps up and scampers into the underbrush
threepio asks wicket where paploo went and is given a short reply
uh princess leia
im afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash
paploo has slipped out of the undergrowth near where the imperial scouts are lounging
he silently swings his furry ball of a body onto one of the scouts speeder bikes and begins flipping switches at random
suddenly the bikes engine fires up with a tremendous roar
paploo grins and continues flipping switches
the scouts leap up in surprise
han leia and company watch in distress
han sighs there goes our surprise attack
the imperial scouts race toward paploo just as his speeder zooms into motion
paploo hangs on by his paws and shoots away into the forest
three of the imperial scouts jump on their rocket bikes and speed away in pursuit
the fourth watches them go from his post at the door
han leia and chewie exchange delighted looks
not bad for a little furball
theres only one left
you stay here
well take care of this
han and the wookiee nod at each other and slip down toward the bunker
threepio moves to stand next to wicket and artoo
i have decided that we shall stay here
paploo sails through the trees more lucky than in control
its scary but he loves it
when the imperial scouts pull within sight behind him and begin firing laser bolts he decides hes had enough
as he rounds a tree out of their sight paploo grabs a vine and swings up into the trees
a moment later the scouts tear under him in pursuit of the still flying unoccupied bike
han sneaks up behind the remaining imperial scout taps him on the shoulder and lets the scout chase him behind the bunker into the arms of the waiting rebel strike
han returns to the front and taps out a pattern on the bunker doors control panel
everyone stands out of sight police style as the door opens
han and leia peek inside
no sign of life
the group enters the bunker silently leaving one lookout behind
the elevator opens
vader and luke enter the room alone
they walk across the dark space to stand before the throne father and son side by side beneath the gaze of the emperor
vader bows to his master
welcome young skywalker
i have been expecting you
luke peers at the hooded figure defiantly
the emperor then looks down at lukes binders
you no longer need those
the emperor motions ever so slightly with his finger and lukes binders fall away clattering to the floor
luke looks down at his own hands free now to reach out and grab the emperors neck
he does nothing
guards leave us
the red cloaked guards turn and disappear behind the elevator
emperor to luke im looking forward to completing your training
in time you will call me master
youre gravely mistaken
you wont convert me as you did my father
the emperor gets down from his throne and walks up very close to luke
the emperor looks into his eyes and for the first time luke can perceive the evil visage within the hood
oh no my young jedi
you will find that it is you who are mistaken
about a great many things
vader extends a gloved hand toward the emperor revealing lukes lightsaber
the emperor takes it
ah yes a jedis weapon
much like your fathers
by now you must know your father can never be turned from the dark side
so will it be with you
soon ill be dead
and you with me
the emperor laughs
perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your rebel fleet
luke looks up sharply
i assure you we are quite safe from your friends here
vader looks at luke
your overconfidence is your weakness
your faith in your friends is yours
it is pointless to resist my son
the emperor turns to face luke
emperor angry everything that has transpired has done so according to my design
indicates endor your friends up there on the sanctuary moon
the emperor notes it
emperor cont are walking into a trap
as is your rebel fleet
it was i who allowed the alliance to know the location of the shield generator
it is quite safe from your pitiful little band
an entire legion of my best troops awaits them
lukes look darts from the emperor to vader and finally to the sword in the emperors hand
im afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive
han leia chewie and the rebel strike team storm through a door and enter the main control room taking all of the personnel prisoner
the rebel troops herd the generator controllers away from their panels
leia glances at one of the screens on the control panel
the fleet will be here any moment
come on come on
outside threepio watches nervously in the bushes as several more controllers and stormtroopers run into the bunker leaving guards at the door
threepio to wicket oh my
theyll be captured
wicket chatters in ewok language and then takes off full steam into the forest
wait come back
artoo stay with me
inside the bunker han looks up from setting charges as an imperial commander enters
you rebel scum
han and leia spin to find dozens of imperial weapons trained on them and their cohorts
a poised force of imperial troops surround them
even more pour into the room roughly disarming the rebel contingent
han leia and chewie exchange looks
the death star and its sanctuary moon hang distant in space as the rebel fleet comes out of hyperspace with an awesome roar
the millennium falcon and several rebel fighters are at the front as the space armada bears down on its target
lando flips switches checks his screen and speaks into the radio
all wings report in
red leader standing by
gray leader standing by
green leader standing by
lock s foils in attack positions
from the bridge of the rebel headquarters frigate admiral ackbar watches the fighters massing outside his viewscreen
may the force be with us
lando looks worriedly at his alien copilot nien nunb who points to the control panel and talks to lando
weve got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield up or down
well how could they be jamming us if they dont know if were coming
lando shoots a concerned look out at the approaching death star as the implications of what hes just said sink in
he hits a switch on his comlink
break off the attack
the shield is still up
i get no reading
are you sure
all craft pull up
the falcon turns hard to the left
out the window the stars and the death star move off right
the falcon and the fighters of red squad veer off desperately to avoid the unseen wall
alarms are screaming and lights flashing as the huge ship changes course abruptly
other ships in the fleet shoot by outside as the armada tries to halt its forward momentum
take evasive action
green group stick close to holding sector mv
a mon calamari controller turns away from his screen and calls out to ackbar quite excited
the admiral rushes over to the controller
admiral we have enemy ships in sector
on the screen can be seen the moon death star and the massive imperial fleet
ackbar moves to the comlink
its a trap
lando over comlink fighters coming in
there is much excitement on the bridge as the attack begins
the millennium falcon and several squads of rebel fighters head into an armada of tie fighters
the sky explodes as a fierce dogfight ensues in and around the giant rebel cruisers
theres too many of them
accelerate to attack speed
draw their fire away from the cruisers
copy gold leader
the battle continues around the giant cruisers
through the round window behind the emperors throne can be seen the distant flashes of the space battle in progress
see for yourself
the emperor is sitting in his throne with vader standing at his side
luke moves to look through a small section of the window
from here you will witness the final destruction of the alliance and the end of your insignificant rebellion
luke is in torment
he glances at his lightsaber sitting on the armrest of the throne
the emperor watches him and smiles touches the lightsaber
you want this dont you
the hate is swelling in you now
take your jedi weapon
i am unarmed
strike me down with it
give in to your anger
with each passing moment you make yourself more my servant
vader watches luke in his agony
it is unavoidable
it is your destiny
you like your father are now mine
han leia chewie and the rest of the strike team are led out of the bunker by their captors
the surrounding area deserted before is now crowded with two legged imperial walkers and hundreds of imperial troops
the situation looks hopeless
all right move it
i said move it
from the undergrowth beyond the clearing comes a wild series of beeps and whistles
i say over there
were you looking for me
bring those two down here
artoo and threepio are standing near one of the big trees
as six imperial stormtroopers rush over to take them captive the two droids duck out of sight behind the tree
well theyre on their way
artoo are you sure this was a good idea
the stormtroopers come around the tree and find the two droids waiting quietly to be taken
as the imperial troops move to do that however a band of ewoks drops down from above and overpowers them
stand back artoo
in a nearby tree an ewok raises a horn to his lips and sounds the ewok attack call
all hell breaks loose as hundreds of ewoks throw their fuzzy bodies into the fray against the assembled stormtroopers and their awesome two legged walkers
biker scouts dart about blasting ewoks only to be crushed by a volley of rocks tossed by ewoks from the trees above
in the confusion of the battle han and leia break away and dive for the cover of the bunker door as explosions erupt around them
han goes to the bunker door control panel
the codes changed
we need artoo
heres the terminal
leia into comlink artoo where are you
we need you at the bunker right away
artoo and threepio are hiding behind a log as the battle ragesaround them
suddenly the stubby little astrodroid lets out a series of whistles and shoots off across the battlefield
threepio panicked runs after him
what do you mean youre going
but but going where artoo
oh this is no time for heroics
biker scouts race around and over the two droids blasting away at the little ewoks as the furries scurry for cover
a group of ewoks have moved a primitive catapult into position
they fire off a large boulder that hits one of the walkers
the walker turns and heads for the catapult blasting away with both guns
the ewoks abandon their weapons and flee in all directions
just as the walker moves in to stomp the catapult ewoks drop vines restraining two huge logs that swing down and smash thewalkers head flat
a line of ewoks hang desperately to a vine that is hooked to a walkers foot
as the walker moves along the fuzzy creatures are dragged behind
two speeder bikes chase ewoks through the underbrush
as the scouts round a tree they are knocked off their bikes by a vinetied between two trees
the falcon and other rebel fighters are engaged in a ferocious combat with imperial tie fighters the battle raging around thecruisers of the rebel armada
lando is in radio communication with the pilots of the other rebel squads
watch yourself wedge
three from above
red three red two pull in
three of them coming in twenty degrees
cut to the left
ill take the leader
theyre heading for the medical frigate
lando steers the falcon through a complete flip as his crew fires at the ties from the belly guns
the copilot nien nunb chatters an observation
only the fighters are attacking
i wonder what those star destroyers are waiting for
the giant imperial star destroyer waits silently some distance from the battle
the emperors huge super star destroyer rests in the middle of the fleet
admiral piett and two fleet commanders watch the battle at the huge window of the super star destroyer bridge
were in attack position now sir
were not going to attack
i have my orders from the emperor himself
he has something special planned for them
we only need to keep them from escaping
the emperor vader and a horrified luke watch the aerial battle fireworks out the window and on the viewscreens
another rebel ship explodes against the protective shield
as you can see my young apprentice your friends have failed
now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational battle station
into comlink fire at will commander
luke in shock looks out across the surface of the death star to the rebel fleet beyond
controllers pull back on several switches
commander jerjerrod stands over them
a button is pressed which switches on a panel of lights
a hooded imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever
a huge beam of light emanates from a long shaft
two stormtroopers stand to one side at a control panel
the giant laser dish on the completed half of the death star begins to glow then a powerful beams shoots out toward the aerial battle
the air is thick with giant ships
in among them rebel x wings dogfight with imperial tie fighters
now an enormous rebel cruiser is hit by the death star beam and is blown to dust
the millennium falcon roars over camera followed closely byseveral tie fighters
the ship is buffeted by the tremendous explosion of the rebel cruiser
lando and his copilot are stunned by the sight of the death star firepower
that blast came from the death star
that things operational
into comlink home one this is gold leader
ackbar stands amid the confusion on the wide bridge and speaks into the comlink
we saw it
all craft prepare to retreat
you wont get another chance at this admiral
we have no choice general calrissian
our cruisers cant repel firepower of that magnitude
han will have that shield down
weve got to give him more time
artoo and threepio make it to the door as han and leia provide cover fire
oh artoo hurry
the little droid moves to the terminal and plugs in his computer arm
a large explosion hits near artoo knocking him head over heels finally landing on his feet
the stubby astrodroids head is spinning and smoldering
suddenly there is a loud sprooing and han and leia turn around to see artoo with all his compartment doors open and all of his appendages sticking out water and
smoke spurt out of the nozzles in his body
han rushes to the terminal as threepio rushes to his wounded companion
artoo why did you have to be so brave
well i suppose i could hotwire this thing
ill cover you
ewoks in handmade primitive hanggliders drop rocks onto the stormtroopers divebombing their deadly adversaries
one is hit in the wing with laser fire and crashes
a walker lumbers forward shooting laser blasts at frantic ewoks running in all directions
two ewoks are struck down by laser blasts
one tries to awaken his friend then realizes that he is dead
the rebel fleet continues to be picked off from one side by the death stars deadly beam from the other by the rampaging imperial star destroyers
lando steers the falcon wildly through an obstacle course of floating giants
hes been yelling into the comlink
lando desperately yes
i said closer
move as close as you can and engage those star destroyers at point blank range
at that close range we wont last long against those star destroyers
well last longer then we will against that death star
and we might just take a few of them with us
the rebel cruisers move very close to the imperial star destroyers and begin to blast away at point blank range
tiny fighters race across the giant surfaces against a backdrop of laser fire
the control tower of a star destroyer is under attack
shes gonna blow
the damaged y wing plummets toward the star destroyer and crashes into the control tower exploding
out of the window and on the view screens the rebel fleet is being decimated in blinding explosions of light and debris
but in here there is no sound of battle
the emperor turns to luke
your fleet has lost
and your friends on the endor moon will not survive
there is no escape my young apprentice
the alliance will die
as will your friends
lukes eyes are full of rage
vader watches him
i can feel your anger
i am defenseless
take your weapon
strike me down with all your hatred and your journey towards the dark side will be complete
luke can resist no longer
the lightsaber flies into his hand
he ignites it in an instant and swings at the emperor
vaders lightsaber flashes into view blocking lukes blow before it can reach the emperor
the two blades spark at contact
luke turns to fight his father
the battle rages on
stormtroopers fire on ewoks with sophisticated weapons while their furry little adversaries sneak up behind the imperial troopers and bash them over the head with large clubs
a walker marches through the undergrowth blasting ewoks as it goes
an ewok warrior gives the signal and a pile of logs is cut loose
the logs tumble under the walkers feet causing it to slip and slide until it finally topples over with a great crash
a scout bike races past and is lassoed with a heavy vine
the other end of the vine is tied to a tree and the bike swings around in ever tightening circles until it runs out of rope and crashes into the
trees with a huge explosion
chewie swings on a vine to the roof of one of the walkers
two ewoks cling to him
they land with a thud on the top of the lurching machine then hang on for dear life
one of the ewoks peeks through the window
get him off of there
the walker pilot opens the hatch to see whats going on
he is yanked out and tossed overboard before he can scream
the two ewoks jump into the cockpit and knock the second pilot unconscious
the ewoks are thrown violently as the mighty machine careens out of control
outside chewie is almost knocked overboard he sticks his head into the hatch with a series of angry barks
the ewoks are too busy and frightened to listen to the wookiees complaint
chewie slips inside the walker
chewbaccas walker moves through the forest firing laser blasts at unsuspecting stormtroopers and destroying other imperial walkers
the ewoks shout and cheer as the giant machine helps turn the tide of the battle in their favor
han works furiously at the control panel wires spark as he attempts to hotwire the door
he motions to leia who is blasting away at some stormtroopers
i think i got it
i got it
the three wires spark as the connection is made
with a loud whoosh a second blast door crashes down in front of the first
han frowns and turns back to the wires again
leia exchanges shots with stormtroopers in the bushes then suddenly cries out in pain her shoulder hit by a laser blast
oh princess leia are you all right
its not bad
leia holds her laser gun ready behind han out of view of the two stormtroopers moving toward them
han and leias eyes lock the moment seems suspended in time
i love you
another shared look between them as she smiles up at han
han stands up slowly and turns revealing the gun in leias hand
she disposes of the stormtroopers in a flash
as han turns back toward leia he looks up to see a giant walker approach and stand before him its deadly weapons aimed right at him
han to leia stay back
the hatch on top of the walker opens and chewie sticks his head out and barks triumphantly
get down here
i got an idea
luke and vader are engaged in a man to man duel of lightsabers even more vicious then the battle on bespin
but the young jedi has grown stronger in the interim and now the advantage shifts to him
vader is forced back losing his balance and is knocked down the stairs
luke stands at the top of the stairs ready to attack
emperor laughing good
use your aggressive feelings boy
let the hate flow through you
luke looks momentarily toward the emperor then back to vader and realizes he is using the dark side
he steps back turns off his lightsaber and relaxes driving the hate from his being
obi wan has taught you well
i will not fight you father
vader walks back up the stairs to luke
you are unwise to lower your defenses
vader attacks forcing luke on the defensive
the young jedi leaps in an amazing reverse flip up to the safety of the catwalk overhead
vader stands below him
your thoughts betray you father
i feel the good in you
there is no conflict
you couldnt bring yourself to kill me before and i dont believe youll destroy me now
you underestimate the power of the dark side
if you will not fight then you will meet your destiny
vader throws the laser sword and it cuts through the supports holding the catwalk then returns to vaders hand
luke tumbles to the ground in a shower of sparks and rolls out of sight under the emperors platform
vader moves to find him
emperor laughs good
the two armadas like their sea bound ancestors blast away at each other in individual point blank confrontations
a star destroyer explodes
the rebel victor limps away its back half alive with a series of minor explosions
the rebel cruiser manages to move in next to a second star destroyer before it explodes completely taking the imperial star destroyer with it
the falcon and several fighters attack one of the larger imperial ships
im on it gold leader
good shot red two
come on han old buddy
dont let me down
controllers watch the main viewscreen on which a vague figure of an imperial walker pilot can be seen
there is a great deal of static and interference
its over commander
the rebels have been routed
theyre fleeing into the woods
we need reinforcements to continue the pursuit
the controllers cheer
send three squads to help
open the back door
as the door to the bunker opens and the imperial troops rush out theyre surprised to find themselves surrounded by rebels their weapons pointed at them
ewoks holding bows and arrows appear on the roof of the bunker
the imperial troops throw down their guns as han and chewie rush inside the bunker with explosive charges
han chewie and several troops rush into the control room and plant explosive charges on the control panels and rush out
throw me another charge
vader stalks the low ceilinged area on the level below the throne searching for luke in the semi darkness his lightsaber held ready
you cannot hide forever luke
i will not fight you
give yourself to the dark side
it is the only way you can save your friends
yes your thoughts betray you
your feelings for them are strong
vader stops and senses something
luke shuts his eyes tightly in anguish
you have a twin sister
your feelings have now betrayed her too
obi wan was wise to hide her from me
now his failure is complete
if you will not turn to the dark side then perhaps she will
never r r
luke ignites his lightsaber and screams in anger rushing at hisfather with a frenzy we have not seen before
sparks fly as luke and vader fight in the cramped area
lukes hatred forces vader to retreat out of the low area and across a bridge overlooking a vast elevator shaft
each stroke of lukes sword drives his father further toward defeat
the dark lord is knocked to his knees and as he raises his sword to block another onslaught luke slashes vaders right hand off at the wrist causing metal and
electronic parts to fly from the mechanical stump
vaders sword clatters uselessly away over the edge of the platform and into the bottomless shaft below
luke moves over vader and holds the blade of his sword to the dark lords throat
the emperor watches with uncontrollable pleased agitation
your hate has made you powerful
now fulfill your destiny and take your fathers place at my side
luke looks at his fathers mechanical hand then to his own mechanical black gloved hand and realizes how much he is becoming like his father
he makes the decision for which he has spent a lifetime in preparation
luke steps back and hurls his lightsaber away
ill never turn to the dark side
youve failed your highness
i am a jedi like my father before me
the emperors glee turns to rage
so be it
han and several of the fighters run out of the bunker and race across the clearing
a shock wave knocks them flat as the bunker explodes followed by a spectacular display as the huge shield generator radar dish explodes along with the bunker
ackbar sitting in his control chair speaks into the radio
the shield is down
commence attack on thedeath stars main reactor
were on our way
red group gold group all fighters follow me
laughs told you theyd do it
the falcon followed by several smaller rebel fighters heads toward the unfinished superstructure of the death star
luke stands still as the emperor reaches the bottom of thestairs
the emperors laughter has turned to anger
he raises his arms toward luke
if you will not be turned you will be destroyed
blinding bolts of energy evil lightning shoot from the emperors hands at luke
even in his surprise the young jedi tries to use the force to deflect them
at first he is half successful but after a moment the bolts of energy are coming with such speed and power the young jedi shrinks before them his knees buckling
the wounded vader struggles to his feet and moves to stand at his masters side
only now at the end do you understand
luke is almost unconscious beneath the continuing assault of the emperors lightning
he clutches a canister to keep from falling into the bottomless shaft as the bolts tear through him
your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side
you have paid the price for your lack of vision
luke writhes on the floor in unbearable pain reaching weakly up toward where vader stands watching
luke groans father please
again vader stands watching luke
he looks at his master the emperor then back to luke on the floor
now young skywalker
you will die
although it would not have seemed possible the outpouring of bolts from the emperors fingers actually increases in intensity the sound screaming through the room
lukes body writhes in pain
vader grabs the emperor from behind fighting for control of the robed figure despite the dark lords weakened body and gravely weakened arm
the emperor struggles in his embrace his bolt shooting hands now lifted high away from luke
now the white lightning arcs back to strike at vader
he stumbles with his load as the sparks rain off his helmet and flow down over his black cape
he holds his evil master high over his head and walks to the edge of the abyss at the central core of the throne room
with one final burst of his once awesome strength darth vader hurls the emperors body into the bottomless shaft
the emperors body spins helplessly into the void arcing as it falls into the abyss
finally when the body is far down the shaft it explodes creating a rush of air through the room
vaders cape is whipped by the wind and he staggers and collapses toward the bottomless hole
luke crawls to his fathers side and pulls him away from the edge of the abyss to safety
both the young jedi and the giant warrior are too weak to move
rebel fighters follow the falcon across the surface of the death star to the unfinished portion where they dive into the superstructure of the giant battle station followed by many
im going in
here goes nothing
three x wings lead the chase through the ever narrowing shaft followed by the falcon and four other fighters plus tie fighters who continually fire at the rebels
lights reflect off the pilots faces as they race through the dark shaft
now lock onto the strongest power source
it should be the power generator
and stay alert
we could run out of space real fast
the fighters and the falcon race through the tunnel still pursued by the tie fighters
one of the x wings is hit from behind and explodes
split up and head back to the surface
see if you can get a few of those tie fighters to follow you
copy gold leader
the rebel ships peel off pursued by three of the ties while lando and wedge continue through the main tunnel
it narrows and the falcon scrapes the side dangerously
two other tie fighters continue to blast away at them
that was too close
nien nunb agrees
the battle between the rebel and imperial fleet rages on
several cruisers fire at the giant super star destroyer
weve got to give those fighters more time
concentrate all fire on that super star destroyer
x wings pilots head across the surface of the huge battleship
admiral piett and a commander stand at the window looking out to the battle
they look concerned
sir weve lost our bridge deflector shield
intensify the forward batteries
i dont want anything to get through
the commander is looking out of the window where a damaged rebel fighter is out of control and heading directly toward the bridge
intensify forward firepower
its too late
the rebel pilot screams as his ship hits the star destroyer causing a huge explosion
the giant battle ship loses control crashes into the death star and explodes
there is excitement on the bridge as the battle rages on all sides
they cheer as the giant star destroyer blows up
for the first time the death star is rocked by explosions as the rebel fleet no longer backed against a wall zooms over unloading a heavy barrage
imperial troops run in all directions confused and desperate to escape
in the midst of this uproar luke is trying to carry the enormous deadweight of his fathers weakening body toward an imperial shuttle
finally luke collapses from the strain
the explosions grow louder as vader draws him closer
vader a whisper luke help me take this mask off
but youll die
nothing can stop that now
just for once
let me look on you with my own eyes
slowly hesitantly luke removes the mask from his fathers face
there beneath the scars is an elderly man
his eyes do not focus
but the dying man smiles at the sight before him
anakin very weak now
go my son
youre coming with me
i cant leave you here
ive got to save you
you already have luke
you were right about me
tell your sister
you were right
i wont leave you
darth vader anakin skywalker
lukes father dies
a huge explosion rocks the docking bay
slowly luke rises and half carrying half dragging the body of his father stumbles toward a shuttle
the millennium falcon leads a swerving bomb run through the immense superstructure of the half built death star
the rebel star cruisers outside continually bombard the huge station
and each direct hit is answered by resonating chain reaction explosions within the station itself
landos crew fires away at the pursuing tie fighters as the dashing baron of bespin and his alien copilot home in on the main reactor shaft
it is awesome
a lone x wing is just in front of the falcon
there it is
all right wedge
go for the power regulator on the north tower
copy gold leader
im already on my way out
the x wing heads for the top of the huge reactor and fires several proton torpedoes at the power regulator causing a series of small explosions
the falcon heads for the main reactor and when it is dangerously close lando fires the missiles which shoot out of the falcon with a powerful roar and hit directly
at the center of the main reactor
he maneuvers the falcon out of the winding superstructure just ahead of the continuing chain of explosions
ackbar and other mon calamari lean on the railing of the bridge watching the large screen showing the death star in the main briefing room
move the fleet away from the death star
an imperial shuttle with luke alone in the cockpit rockets out of the main docking bay as that entire section of the death star is blown away
finally just as it looks like the falcon will not make it lando expertly pilots the craft out of the exploding superstructure and whizzes toward the sanctuary moon only a
moment before the death star supernovas into oblivion
lando and nien nunb laugh and cheer in relief
han and leia chewie the droids the rebel troops and the ewoks all look to the sky as the death star reveals itself in a final flash of self destruction
they all cheer
they did it
han looks town from the sky to leia a look of concern on his face
leia continues to look at the sky as though listening for a silent voice
im sure luke wasnt on that thing when it blew
i can feel it
you love him dont you
leia smiles puzzled
when he comes back i wont get in the way
she realizes his misunderstanding
no its not like that at all
hes my brother
han is stunned by this news
she smiles and they embrace
luke sets a torch to the logs stacked under a funeral pyre where his fathers body lies again dressed in black mask and helmet
he stands watching sadly as the flames leap higher to consume darth vader anakin skywalker
in the sky above fireworks explode and rebel fighters zoom above the forest
a huge bonfire is the centerpiece of a wild celebration
rebels and ewoks rejoice in the warm glow of firelight drums beating singing dancing and laughing in the communal language of victory and liberation
lando runs in and is enthusiastically hugged by han and chewie
then finally luke arrives and the friends rush to greet and embrace him
they stand close this hardy group taking comfort in each others touch together to the end
rebels and ewoks join together in dancing and celebration
the original group of adventurers watch from the sidelines
only luke seems distracted alone in their midsts his thoughts elsewhere
he looks off to the side and sees three shimmering smiling figures at the edge of the shadows ben kenobi yoda and anakin skywalker
