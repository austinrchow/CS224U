written by lawrence kasdan and leigh brackett from a story by george lucas a star destroyer moves through space releasing imperial probe robots from its underside
one of these probes zooms toward the planet hoth and lands on its ice covered surface
an explosion marks the point of impact
a weird mechanical sound rises above the whining of the wind
a strange probe robot with several extended sensors emerges from the smoke shrouded crater
the ominous mechanical probe floats across the snow plain and disappears into the distance
a small figure gallops across the windswept ice slope
the bundled rider is mounted on a large gray snow lizard a tauntaun
curving plumes of snow rise from beneath the speeding paws of the two legged beast
the rider gallops up a slope and reins his lizard to a stop
pulling off his protective goggles luke skywalker notices something in the sky
he takes a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt and through them sees smoke rising from where the probe robot has crashed
the wind whips at lukes fur lined cap and he activates a comlink transmitter
his tauntaun shifts and moans nervously beneath him
into comlink echo three to echo seven
han old buddy do you read me
after a little static a familiar voice is heard
over comlink loud and clear kid
into comlink well i finished my circle
i dont pick up any life readings
over comlink there isnt enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser
the sensors are placed im going back
into comlink right
ill see you shortly
theres a meteorite that hit the ground near here
i want to check it out
it wont take long
luke clicks off his transmitter and reins back on his nervous lizard
he pats the beast on the head to calm it
hey steady girl
whats the matter
you smell something
luke takes a small device from his belt and starts to adjust it when suddenly a large shadow falls over him from behind
he hears a monstrous howl and turns to see an eleven foot tall shape towering over him
it is a wampa ice creature lunging at him ferociously
luke grabs for his pistol but is hit flat in the face by a huge white claw
he falls unconscious into the snow and in a moment the terrified screams of the tauntaun are cut short by the horrible snap of a neck being broken
the wampa ice creature grabs luke by one ankle and drags him away across the frozen plain
a stalwart figure rides his tauntaun up to the entrance of an enormous ice cave
rebel troopers rush about unloading supplies and otherwise securing their new base
the rider han solo swings off his lizard and pulls off his goggles
he walks into the main hangar deck toward the millennium falcon which is parked among several fighters
mechanics r units and various other droids hurry about
han stops at the millennium falcon where his wookiee copilot chewbacca is welding on a central lifter
chewie stops his work and lifts his face shield growling an irritated greeting to his boss
the wookiee grumbles a reply
all right dont lose your temper
ill come right back and give you a hand
chewbacca puts his mask back on and returns to his welding as han leaves
a makeshift command center has been set up in a blasted area of thick ice
the low ceilinged room is a beehive of activity
controllers troops and droids move about setting up electronic equipment and monitoring radar signals
general rieekan straightens up from a console at hans approach
no sign of life out there general
the sensors are in place
youll know if anything comes around
commander skywalker reported in yet
hes checking out a meteorite that hit near him
indicates radar screen with all the meteor activity in this system its going to be difficult to spot approaching ships
taking a deep breath han blurts out what is on his mind
general ive got to leave
i cant stay anymore
princess leia standing at a console nearby is dressed in a short white combat jacket and pants
her hair is braided across her head in a nordic fashion
she overhears their conversation and seems somewhat distressed
im sorry to hear that
well theres a price on my head
if i dont pay off jabba the hut im a dead man
a death marks not an easy thing to live with
youre a good fighter solo
i hate to lose you
thank you general
he turns to leia as rieekan moves away
with feeling well your highness i guess this is it
leia is angry
han sees she has no warmth to offer him
he shakes his head and adopts a sarcastic tone
cooly well dont get all mushy on me
so long princess
han walks away into the quiet corridor adjoining the command center
leia stews a moment then hurries after him
han stops in the corridor and turns to face leia
yes your highnessness
i thought you decided to stay
well the bounty hunter we ran into on ord mantell changed my mind
han we need you
oh what about you need
mystified i need
i dont know what youre talking about
shakes his head fed up you probably dont
and what precisely am i supposed to know
you want me to stay because of the way you feel about me
youre a great help to us
youre a natural leader
thats not it
aahhh uh huh
leia stares at him understanding then laughs
youre imagining things
then why are you following me
afraid i was going to leave without giving you a goodbye kiss
id just as soon kiss a wookiee
i can arrange that
you could use a good kiss
angrily han strides down the corridor as leia stares after him
a familiar stream of beeps and whistles herald the approach of artoo detoo and see threepio who appear around a corner and move along an ice wall toward the main
dont try to blame me
i didnt ask you to turn on the thermal heater
i merely commented that it was freezing in the princess chamber
but its supposed to be freezing
how are we going to dry out all her clothes
i really dont know
artoo beeps a stream of protesting whistles
oh switch off
the two robots stop at han solos space freighter
han and chewie are struggling with their central lifters
to chewie why do you take this apart now
im trying to get us out of here and you pull both of these
chewie grumbles in irritation
excuse me sir
to chewie put them back together right now
might i have a word with you please
what do you want
well its princess leia sir
shes been trying to get you on the communicator
i turned it off
i dont want to talk to her
well princess leia is wondering about master luke
he hasnt come back yet
she doesnt know where he is
i dont know where he is
nobody knows where he is
what do you mean nobody knows
han glances at the fading light at the entrance of the ice cave as night slowly begins to fall on the planet
well uh you see
han jumps down off the lift as threepio follows him
excuse me sir
might i inqu
han abruptly puts his hand over threepios mouth as the deck officer approaches
do you know where commander skywalker is
i havent seen him
its possible he came in through the south entrance
why dont you go find out
its getting dark out there
the deck officer leaves hurriedly as han takes his hand off threepios mouth
excuse me sir
might i inquire whats going on
come along artoo lets find princess leia
between ourselves i think master luke is in considerable danger
the deck officer and his assistant hurry toward han as he enters the tunnel
sir commander skywalker hasnt come in through the south entrance
he might have forgotten to check in
are the speeders ready
were having some trouble adapting them to the cold
then well have to go out on tauntauns
sir the temperatures dropping too rapidly
and my friends out in it
ill cover sector twelve
have com control set screen alpha
han pushes through the troops and mounts a tauntaun
your tauntaunll freeze before you reach the first marker
then ill see you in hell
han maneuvers his mount out of the cave and races into the dark bitter night
the jagged face of a huge ice wall sits gloomily in the dim twilight of a hoth day
luke hangs upside down ankles frozen into icy stalactites his extended arms within a foot of the snow floor
one side of his face is covered in a dried mask of frozen blood
he opens his eyes as a chilling moan of the hideous ice creature echoes off the gorge walls
luke pulls himself up grabs hold of his ankles and futilely tries to unfasten the throngs
exhausted he drops back into his hanging position
as he hangs there he spies his lightsaber lying near a pile of his discarded gear about three feet out of reach
he focuses on the saber and as his hand strains toward the weapon he squeezes his eyes tight in concentration
just as the ice creature looms over luke the lightsaber jumps into lukes hand
the young warrior instantly ignites his sword swinging up and cuts himself loose from the ice
he flops to the snow in a heap
the startled creature moves back his giant yellow eyes blinking
luke scrambles to his feet
he swings his lightsaber and the beast screams in pain
luke staggers out of the gorge into the dark and snowy twilight
weak and exhausted he stumbles down a snow bank
a small lone figure riding a tauntaun races through the hostile vastness of snow and cold
as it runs the tauntauns legs kick up large clouds of snow and ice into the snowy air
artoo stands in the falling snow beeping worriedly
threepio moves stiffly over to him
you must come along now artoo
theres really nothing more we can do
and my joints are freezing up
artoo beeps long and low
dont say thing like that
of course well see master luke again
hell be quite all right youll see
to himself stupid little short circuit
hell be quite all right
threepio turns to go back inside the main hangar as artoo mournfully keeps his vigil
the wind is blowing quite strong now
luke struggles to stay upright but a blast of freezing snow knocks him over
he struggles to get up but he cant
the young warrior from tatooine drags himself a couple of feet and then collapses
princess leia stands inside the dark entrance to the rebel base waiting for a sign of the two rebel heroes
she shivers in the cold wind as nearby chewie sits with his head in his hands
in the background artoo and threepio move through the doors
a rebel lieutenant moves to major derlin an officer keeping watch with the princess
sir all the patrols are in
theres still no contact from skywalker or solo
mistress leia artoo says hes been quite unable to pick up any signals although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope
leia nods an acknowledgment but she is lost in thought
your highness theres nothing more we can do tonight
the shield doors must be closed
he turns to the lieutenant
close the doors
the lieutenant walks away
chewie lets out a long mournful howl somewhat like a coyote
at the same moment artoo begins a complex series of efficient beeps
artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventy five
leia stands praying to herself as the huge metal doors slam across the entrance of the ice cave
the loud booms echo throughout the huge cavern
chewie lets out another suffering howl
actually artoo has been known to make mistakes
from time to time
oh dear oh dear
dont worry about master luke
im sure hell be all right
hes quite clever you know
for a human being
luke lies face down in the snow nearly unconscious
slowly he looks up and sees ben kenobi barely visible through the blowing snow
it is hard to tell if kenobi is real or a hallucination
you will go to the dagobah system
there you will learn from yoda the jedi master who instructed me
the image of ben fades revealing a lone tauntaun rider approaching from the windswept horizon
groaning faintly ben
luke drops into unconsciousness
han pulls up and leaps off his mount
he hurries to his snow covered friend cradling him in his arms
hans tauntaun lets out a low pitiful bellow
but hans concern is with luke and he shakes him urgently
dont do this luke
come on give me a sign here
luke doesnt respond
han begins frantically rubbing and slapping lukes unconscious face
as he starts to lift the youth han hears a rasping sound behind him
he turns just in time to see his tauntaun stagger and then fall over into the snow
han carries luke to the moaning beast
then with a final groan the tauntaun expires
not much time
he pushes lukes inert form against the belly of the dead beast
hang on kid
han ignites lukes saber and cuts the beast from head to toe
he quickly tosses its steaming innards into the snow then lifts lukes inert form and stuffs him inside the carcass
reeling from the odor whew
this may smell bad kid
but it will keep you warm
til i get the shelter built
struggling to get luke inside the carcass ooh
i thought they smelled bad on the outside
the wind has picked up considerably making it difficult to move
han removes a pack from the dead creatures back taking out a shelter container
he begins to set up what can only be a pitiful protection against a bitter hoth night
four snub nosed armored snowspeeders race across the white landscape
there is only one pilot zev in the enclosed two man craft
he concentrates on the scopes which ring his cockpit
he hears a low beep from one of his monitors
into transmitter echo base
ive got something
not much but it could be a life form
the small craft banks and makes a slow arc then races off in a new direction
the pilot switches over to a new transmitter
into transmitter this is rogue two
this is rogue two
captain solo so you copy
commander skywalker do you copy
this is rogue two
there is a sharp crackle of static then a faint voice
filtered over zevs receiver good morning
nice of you guys to drop by
switching transmitters echo base
this is rogue two
i found them
repeat i found them
the small shelter han set up is covered with snow on the windward side
a makeshift antenna rests gingerly on top the snowdrift
han spots zevs snowspeeder approaching in the distance and begins waving his arms frantically at the tiny craft
strange robot surgeons adjust a mass of electronic equipment
a switch is thrown and a sudden blinding flash obscures luke in a bacta tank filled with a thick gelatinous slime
he begins to thrash about raving in delirium
luke sits up in a recovery room bed weak but smiling
his face shows terrible wounds from the wampas attack
threepio and artoo enter the room
master luke sir its so good to see you fully functional again
artoo beeps his good wishes
artoo expresses his relief also
han and chewie make their entrance
the wookiee growls a greeting
how are you feeling kid
you dont look so bad to me
in fact you look strong enough to pull the ears off a gundark
thanks to you
thats two you owe me junior
han turns as leia enters the room
he looks at her with a big devilish grin
well your worship looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer
haughtily i had nothing to do with it
general rieekan thinks its dangerous for any ships to leave the system until weve activated the energy shield
thats a good story
i think you just cant bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight
i dont know where you get your delusions laser brain
chewie is amused he laughs in his manner
han enjoying himself regards chewie good humoredly
laugh it up fuzzball
but you didnt see us alone in the south passage
luke sparks to this he looks at leia
she expressed her true feelings for me
leia is flushed eyes darting between luke and han
why you stuck up
whos scruffy looking
to luke i must have hit pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that huh kid
leia looks vulnerable for a moment then the mask falls again and she focuses on luke
why i guess you dont know everything about women yet
with that she leans over and kisses luke on the lips
then she turns on her heel and walks out leaving everyone in the room slightly dumbstruck
with some smugness luke puts his hands behind his head and grins
suddenly in the distance the muffled sound of an alarm is heard
over loudspeaker headquarters personnel report to command center
the voice repeats the order and han chewie artoo and threepio hurry out of the room bidding farewell to luke
take it easy
excuse us please
rieekan looks up grimly from a console screen
he calls over to leia and han
we have a visitor
the group hurries over to rieekan
weve picked up something outside the base in zone twelve moving east
then it couldnt be one of those creatures that attacked luke
it could be a speeder one of ours
wait theres something very weak coming through
threepio steps up to the control panel and listens intently to the strange signal
sir i am fluent in six million forms of communication
this signal is not used by the alliance
it could be an imperial code
the transmission ends in static
it isnt friendly whatever it is
come on chewie lets check it out
send rogues ten and eleven to station three eight
the dark probe robot moves past the smoldering ruins of station three eight and down a ridge toward the rebel base
it raises a large antenna from the top of its head and begins to send out a piercing signal
the probe droid has spotted chewbacca who not thirty feet away has popped his head over a snow bank
instantly the probe robot swings around its deadly ray ready to fire
but before it can get a shot off it is hit from behind by a laser bolt and explodes in a million pieces
han solo replaces his blaster in its holster and peers intently at the smoldering remains of the imperial probe
leia and rieekan listen to han on the comlink
over comlink afraid theres not much left
into comlink what was it
over comlink droid of some kind
i didnt hit it that hard
it must have had a self destruct
into comlink an imperial probe droid
over comlink its a good bet the empire knows were here
wed better start the evacuation
darth vaders star destroyer larger and more awesome than the five imperial star destroyers that surround it sits in the vastness of space
the six huge ships are surrounded by a convoy of smaller spacecraft
tie fighters dart to and fro
controllers working the vast complex of electronic controls hear ominous approaching footsteps and look up from their controls
the squat evil looking admiral ozzel and the young powerfully built general veers who have been conferring near the front also feel the approaching presence and turn toward it
darth vader lord of the sith enters like a chill wind
as vader moves across the wide bridge captain piett hurries up to ozzel
yes captain i think weve got something sir
the report is only a fragment from a probe droid in the hoth system but its the best lead weve had
irritated we have thousands of probe droids searching the galaxy
i want proof not leads
the visuals indicate life readings
it could mean anything
if we followed every lead
but sir the hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human forms
vader moves to a large screen showing an image of the rebel snow base
rebel speeders can be seen approaching the base in the distance
you found something
yes my lord
studying the image on the console screen thats it
the rebels are there
my lord there are so many uncharted settlements
it could be smugglers it could be
that is the system
and im sure skywalker is with them
set your course for the hoth system
general veers prepare you men
a captain issues instructions to two of his men at the entrance to the main transport bay
several rebel transports behind them are being loaded by men carrying heavy boxes and moving quickly but not in panic
groups seven and ten will stay behind to fly the speeders
as soon as each transport is loaded evacuation control will give clearance for immediate launch
troops ground crews and droids rush to their alert stations
armored snowspeeders are lined up in attack formation near the main entrance
in the midst of all this activity han does some frantic welding on the lifters of the millennium falcon
han finishes his work and hops down to the hangar floor
he pulls out his comlink all the while eyeing problematic lifters
into comlink to chewie okay thats it
turn it off
turn it off
smoke rises from a minor explosion on the lifter
exasperated han surveys the new damage
luke dresses in readiness for the evacuation as his attending medical droid stands by
sir it will take quite a while to evacuate the t forty sevens
well forget the heavy equipment
theres plenty of time to get the smaller modules on the transports
take care sir
pilots gunners and r units scurry about
luke pulling on his heavy weather jacket is headed toward a row of armored speeders
he stops at the rear of the millennium falcon where han and chewie are trying to repair the right lifter with even more haste than before
chewie take care of yourself okay
as luke pats chewie on the arm chewie puts his arms around luke and gives him a tight hug
han is discussing the lifter with a repair droid when he sees luke
to droid theres got to be a reason for it
check it at the other end
wait a second
to luke you all right
luke smiles then waves at his friend and walks on
after a few steps he stops and looks back
han glances up and the two exchange a silent communication each wishing the other safety happiness many things all difficult to verbalize
alarms sound throughout the hidden rebel base
in the control room a controller urgently gestures for general rieekan to check a computer scan
general theres a fleet of star destroyers coming out of hyperspace in sector four
reroute all power to the energy shield
weve got to hold them till all transports are away
prepare for ground assault
rieekan exits hurriedly
the dark cubicle is illuminated by a single shaft of light which falls on the brooding dark lord as he sits on a raised meditation cube
general veers enters the room and approaches the silent unmoving vader
although seemingly very sure of himself veers is still not bold enough to interrupt the meditating lord
the younger general stands quietly at attention until the evil presence speaks
what is it general
my lord the fleet has moves out of light speed
com scan has detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of the hoth system
the field is strong enough to deflect any bombardment
angrily the rebels are alerted to our presence
admiral ozzel came out of light speed too close to the system
he felt surprise was wiser
he is as clumsy as he is stupid
general prepare your troops for a surface attack
yes my lord
veers turns smartly and leaves as vader activates a large viewscreen showing the bridge of his mighty ship
admiral ozzel appears on the viewscreen standing slightly in front of captain piett
lord vader the fleet has moved out of light speed and were preparing to
you have failed me for the last time admiral
piett steps forward as the admiral moves away slightly confused touching his throat as it begins to constrict painfully
yes my lord
make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system
you are in command now admiral piett
thank you lord vader
pietts pleasure about his unexpected promotion is not an unmixed emotion
he glances warily at the struggling admiral ozzel who with a final choke stumbles and falls in a lifeless heap before him
with a sense of urgency leia quickly briefs a group of pilots gathered in the center of the hangar
all troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance
the heavy transport ships will leave as soon as theyre loaded
only two fighter escorts per ship
the energy shield can only be opened for a short time so youll have to stay very close to your transports
two fighters against a star destroyer
the ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any enemy ships will be out of your flight path
when youve gotten past the energy shield proceed directly to the rendezvous point
in unison right
everyone to your stations
the pilots hurry away
rebel troops carry heavy bazooka type weapons and position them along the snow trench
men hurriedly respond to their officers yelled orders and brace themselves against the rhythmic gusts of bitter cold wind
other troops load power packs into a gun turret and swing its guns into position
near the base power generators troops rush to set up their heavy battle equipment
buzzing loudly the generators send along sparking fingers of energy into the bitter hoth wind
the long line of rebel controllers is tense as are princess leia and general rieekan who are trying very hard not to show any fear
their primary target will be the power generators
prepare to open the shield
the rebel transport and two escort fighters begin their departure from the ice planet
a huge imperial star destroyer rest against a sea of stars far above the white surface of the planet hoth
an imperial controller approaches his commander
sir rebel ships are coming into our sector
our first catch of the day
stand by ion control
the giant ball shaped ion cannon rotates into position and blasts two red energy beams skyward
the rebel transport and its escort race away from the white planet closely followed by the two red energy beams
as the rebel transport races toward the waiting imperial star destroyer it is overtaken by the two scarlet energy bolts
the imperial star destroyer is hit in the conning tower by the powerful bolts which set up fiery explosions on its metal hull
the big star destroyer veers then spins wildly out of control
as the imperial ship careers into deep space the rebel transport races away to safety
pilots gunners and troopers hurry to their stations and their vehicles
over loudspeaker the first transport is away
everyone cheers at the announcement which echoes through the hangar
luke turns and walks on heading toward his snowspeeder
his gunner dack a fresh faced eager kid is glad to see him
they climb in
feeling all right sir
just like new dack
how about you
right now i feel like i could take on the whole empire myself
quietly strapping in i know what you mean
a thin horizon line cuts across the bleak landscape
small dot size objects begin to appear on the horizon moving in the direction of the rebel base
a rebel officer lifts a pair of electrobinoculars to his eyes
through the lens he sees a very close view of a giant imperial snow walker
he adjusts the view which then zooms back to reveal three more of the ominous battle machines
small flashes of yellow fire billow from the guns of the lumbering snow walkers
the officer lowers his binoculars as the regular rhythmic pounding begins to make the ground vibrate
the pounding grows louder and is accompanied by a high pitched metallic rattling
the officer speaks into his comlink
echo station three t eight
pilots and gunners race to their waiting snowspeeders
ice and snow begin falling from the walls of the corridor shaken by the pounding imperial snow walker as they draw ever nearer
over comlink we have spotted imperial walkers
imperial walkers on the north ridge
the rebel troops aim their weapons at the horizon as explosions erupt all around them
they are nervous and their grip on their weapons tightens from the cold and from fear
behind the troops a dozen snowspeeders race through the sky
into comlink echo station five seven
were on our way
the fleet of snowspeeders races above the ice field at full throttle
they accelerate away from the base and head toward the distant walkers
into comlink all right boys keep tight now
luke i have no approach vector
im not set
attack pattern delta
the cannons mounted on the walker head fire at the speeders
other walkers loom in the background
two speeders race away past two of the enormous walkers and bank to the right
all right im coming in
he turns his speeder and heads directly at one of the walkers flying toward its towering legs
the horizon twists as the speeder banks between the legs
into comlink hobbie you still with me
two speeders race directly at the head of a walker then split and fly past it
three other walkers march onward firing all cannons
rebel troops fire on the approaching walkers as the snow and ice explode all around them
a speeder banks through and away from the legs of a walker
two other speeders pass the first speeder from the opposite direction
other rebel craft race just above the icy plain
a giant walker head swivels and fires striking a snowspeeder and sending it crashing in a ball of flames
general veers and two walker pilots keep a careful eye on the racing rebel snowspeeders as they maneuver their lumbering war machine forward
lukes speeder banks in from the side of veerss walker and heads straight for its viewport blasting away
an explosion hits the walker window but dissipates doing no harm
the speeder roars up and over the impregnable war machine
luke looks back at the walker as it grows smaller in the distance
that armors too strong for blasters
on the horizon another walker moves up past lukes cockpit window twisting out of sight as luke banks and starts another run
into comlink rogue group use your harpoons and tow cables
go for the legs
it might be our only chance of stopping them
to dack all right stand by dack
dack is at the gunners controls
luke weve got a malfunction in fire control
ill have to cut in the auxiliary
just hang on
hang on dack
get ready to fire that tow cable
barely keeping his seat in the tumbling ship dack struggles to set up his harpoon gun
luke swings his speeder around and heads toward an oncoming walker
laser bolts and flak fill the air creating a deadly obstacle course for the tiny craft
rogue leader and another snowspeeder fly in tight formation toward the walker as explosions burst all around them
after sustaining a heavy volley of fire luke turns around to see if dack is all right
dack is lost
blood streams down his forehead which rests on his smoldering controls
out the back window an imperial walker recedes in the distance
rebel troops fire the dishlike ray gun while explosions erupt around them
two walkers lumber toward the rebel base as a speeder between them explodes in a ball of flames
the dislike ray gun is hit by a laser bolt and instantly explodes
through the cockpit window veers and his pilot can see the rebel power generators in the distance
a hologram of darth vader appears on a control panel screen
yes lord vader
ive reached the main power generator
the shield will be down in moments
you may start your landing
into comlink rogue three
into comlink copy rogue leader over comlink wedge ive lost my gunner
youll have to make this shot
ill cover for you
set your harpoon
follow me on the next pass
into comlink coming around rogue leader
into comlink steady rogue two wedges speeder races through the legs of one of the monstrous walkers
to gunner activate harpoon
wedges gunner reaches for a firing switch to activate the harpoon
the harpoon flashes out and speeds toward the receding legs of the walker
the harpoon hurtles toward the walker in an instant it is embedded in one of the walkers legs
to gunner good shot janson
the speeder rogue three races around one of the giant walkers feet trailing the cable behind it
continuing around the back foot rogue three then circles the walker around the tail end
wedge checks his controls and banks around the front of the walker
one more pass
the speeder sweeps left to right in front of the giant legs towing the cable behind it
wedge swings the speeder between the legs of the giant walker
let her go
the cable release on the back of the speeder snaps loose and the cable drops away
the speeder zooms away into the distance
the tangled legs of the enormous war machine attempt a step but as they do the giant imperial walker begins to topple
it teeters for a moment and then crashes onto the icy ground sending snow and metal pieces flying
the troops in the trenches cheer at the sight of the crashing walker
an officer gives a signal to his men and rebel troops charge the fallen war machine
the troops run toward the downed walker followed by two rebel speeders flying overhead
just as they reach the walker it explodes the impact throwing some of the men onto the frozen ground
wedge lets out a triumphant yell banking his speeder away from the fallen walker
into comlink whooha
that got him
into comlink i see it wedge
large chunks of ice tumble into the command center as leia and general rieekan monitor computer screens
i dont think we can protect two transports at a time
its risky but we cant hold out much longer
we have no choice
into comlink launch patrols
to an aide evacuate remaining ground staff
muffled distant explosions create widening cracks in the ice roof of the hangar
trying to ignore the noise and falling bits of snow han works on one of the falcons lifters while chewie works on one of the wings
noticing chewie attach a wrong part han grows impatient
this one goes there that one goes there
in another area of the hangar threepio watches as artoo is raised up into lukes x wing fighter
artoo you take good care of master luke now understand
and do take good care of yourself
oh dear oh dear
the fierce battle on the vast snow plains of hoth rages on
the imperial walkers continue their slow steady assault on the rebel base firing lasers as they lumber ever onward
in the snow trench rebel troops fire large bazookalike guns and dishlike ray guns as explosions erupt around them
a gun tower is hit by a laser bolt and instantly explodes
another blast destroys a ray gun
general veers studies various readouts on his control panel
all troops will debark for ground assault
prepare to target the main generator
lukes speeder and rogue two fly in formation banking from right to left and flying above the erupting battlefield
flak bursts all around them
luke glancing over sees rogue two on his left
his ship shudders as flak bursts nearby
into comlink rogue two are you all right
into comlink yeah
im with you rogue leader
into comlink well set harpoon
ill cover for you
the two speeders race across the horizon toward the giant walkers
into comlink coming around
into comlink watch that cross fire boys
into comlink set for position three
to gunner steady
over comlink stay tight and low
lukes speeder moves in formation with rogue two when suddenly zevs speeder is hit by a laser bolt
his ship bucks violently under the impact and the cockpit explodes in a ball of flame
spewing smoke the speeder hurtles toward a looming walker
before they collide
rogue two explodes in a million flaming pieces
desperately luke works the controls of his flak buffeted ship
suddenly the speeder is rocked by a huge explosion
luke struggles with the controls with a look of terror on his face
the speeder fills with smoke and electrical sparks jump about the cockpit
into comlink hobbie ive been hit
apart from the distant thunder of laser blasts the corridor is strangely quiet and empty
running footsteps echo through the freezing hallway then han appears
cracks have appeared in some of the walls and some pipes have broken sending hot steam billowing into the underground hallways
han hurries into the command center
it is a shambles but some people are still at their posts
as he enters a gigantic cave in almost obliterates the room
he finds leia and threepio near one of the control boards
you all right
she is surprised to see him
why are you still here
i heard the command center had been hit
you got your clearance to leave
first im going to get you to your ship
your highness we must take this last transport
its our only hope
to controller send all troops in sector twelve to the south slope to protect the fighters
a blast rocks the command center throwing threepio backward into hans arms
over loudspeaker imperial troops have entered the base
to head controller give the evacuation code signal
and get to your transports
leia looks exhausted
han grabs her and starts to lead her out
as han leia and threepio run out of the command center the code signal can be heard echoing off the corridor walls
k one zero
all troops disengage
to han and leia oh
wait for me
rebel troops retreat under the awesome imperial onslaught
troops flee from the battle the ground exploding around them
three of the giant walkers firing lasers advance toward the rebel headquarters
continuing their retreat the rebels see the walkers looming ever nearer
on the battlefield luke watches as a walker foot rises and moves over him
he looks up at the underbelly of the huge walker passing overhead
running beneath the monstrous machine luke fires his harpoon gun at the walkers underside
a thin cable follows the projectile from the gun
the magnetic head and cable attach firmly to the metal hull
still running under the walker luke attaches the cable drum to his belt buckle
soon he is pulled up the cable and hangs dangling underneath the walker
the walkers giant feet continue to pound onward across the frozen snow
stray laser bolts whistle by luke as he climbs up the cable to the walkers hull reaching a small hatch
hanging precariously luke cuts the solid metal hatch with his laser sword
he takes a landmine from around his neck and throws it inside the imperial machine
quickly luke starts down the cable and crashes onto the icy ground far below
he lies unconscious as a giant rear leg passes by and just misses him
the giant walker stops in mid step
a muffled explosion comes from within and then the walkers mechanical insides are spewed out every conceivable opening
the machine sits dead in its tracks smoking like a locomotive on stilts
veerss walker continues to advance toward the rebel base
the smoldering walker that luke exploded stands smoking just to the right of veerss path
inside his walker general veers prepares to fire on the rebel power generators
distance to power generators
one seven decimal two eight
veers reaches for the electrorangefinder and lines up the main generator
maximum fire power
the rebel troops continue their desperate retreat pushed back by the relentless imperial assault
with threepio lagging behind han and leia race through the crumbling ice corridors
suddenly there is an explosion
han turns grabs the princess and pulls her to the wall as a tremendous cave in blacks their path
he takes the comlink from his pocket
into comlink transport this is solo
better take off i cant get to you
ill get the princess out on the falcon
han and leia turn and race down the corridor
where are you going
imperial troops have reached the base
as they push through the blocked passageway darth vader strides behind them
han and leia run toward the entrance of the main hangar where the millennium falcon is docked
threepio still lags behind
wait for me
the door to the hangar closes in his face
exasperated how typical
quickly the door reopens as han reaches out and pulls the golden droid through
chewie paces under the shelter of the millennium falcons landing gear
the giant wookiee pats the underbelly of his beloved ship and barks a few reassuring words
as he searches worriedly for his captain something at last catches his eye
chewie lets out a relieved shriek at seeing han and leia running toward the ship
the wookiee runs out into the falling ice lets out a howl then runs up the ships ramp
han and leia run up the ramp after him closely followed by threepio
hurry up goldenrod or youre going to be a permanent resident
imperial troops run through the base corridors
vader surveys the place
a huge chunk falls almost hitting him but he calmly purposefully continues around it
a distant huge explosion rocks the hangar deck
ice cakes come crashing down on the millennium falcon
han standing before a control panel is busy flipping switches as chewie watches a troublesome gauge
a worried leia observes their efforts
to chewie hows this
the wookiee barks a negative reply
would it helped if i got out and pushed
threepio clanks into the hold
captain solo captain solo
sir might i suggest that you
han gives the gold robot a devastating look
it can wait
they move to the cockpit where han flips some more switches
leia watches him impatient disbelieving
this bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade
this babys got a few surprises left in her sweetheart
han and leia look out the cockpit window and see a squad of stormtroopers rushing into the far side of the hangar
quickly han straps himself into the pilots seat and leia into the navigators chair
stormtroopers hurriedly set up a large bazookalike weapon
behind them the giant hangar doors open slowly
a laser gun appears on the falcon and swings around to aim at the imperial troops
the stormtroopers preparing to fire their bazooka cannon are hit by the falcons fire and are thrown about in all directions
chewie rushes into the cockpit
lets hope we dont have a burnout
a laser hits the window near chewie as he is settling into his chair
letting out a loud whelp chewie quickly pulls back on the controls and the first stage of engine fire can be heard
han flashes a big grin at leia
someday youre going to be wrong and i hope im there to see it
han looks at chewie
the roar of the falcons main engines blasts out everything as the ice cave wall rushes by outside the cockpit window
more stormtroopers run into the hangar closely followed by vader
hearing the loud roar of the millennium falcons engines vader looks toward the main hangar doors just in time to see the falcon lift up and disappear outside the cave
luke and two other pilots look up as the millennium falcon races above them flying very close to the ground
the three pilots turn then and trudge onward toward their x wing fighters each going to his own ship
luke waves farewell then heads toward his own fighter
artoo seated on his cubbyhole chirps an excited greeting as luke climbs aboard the spacecraft
get her ready for takeoff
from his ship luke sees wedge in his own x wing preparing for takeoff
good luck luke
see you at the rendezvous
luke smiles and nods at wedge then lowers himself into the cockpit of his x wing while artoo waits in the cubbyhole beeping impatiently
dont worry artoo
were going were going
the canopy over the x wing lowers and snaps shut
lukes fighter its wings closed speeds away from the icy planet
soon it disappears into the stars
luke looking thoughtful suddenly makes a decision
he flips several switches
the stars shift as he takes his fighter into a steep turn
the x wing banks sharply and flies away in a new direction
the monitor screen on lukes control panel prints out a question from the concerned artoo
into comlink theres nothing wrong artoo
im just setting a new course
artoo beeps once again
into comlink were not going to regroup with the others
artoo begins a protest whistling an unbelieving what
luke reads artoos exclamation on his control panel
into comlink were going to the dagobah system
luke checks his readouts and makes a few adjustments
he rides along with only the soft hum of the instruments to break the silence
finally artoo chirps up
into comlink yes artoo
artoo utters a soft carefully phrased steam of whistles
into comlink chuckling thats all right
id like to keep it on manual control for a while
the little droid lets out a defeated whimper
luke smiles and continues on his course
the millennium falcon speeds away from hoth closely followed by one huge star destroyer and four tiny tie fighters
as it is pursued the falcon races toward two very bright star sized objects
inside the cockpit chewie lets out a loud howl
han checks as the ship is buffeted by exploding flak
he appears to be doing six things at once
harried i saw them
i saw them
star destroyers two of them coming right at us
threepio bumps and bangs his way into the cockpit
might i suggest
to leia shut him up or shut him down
to chewie check the deflector shield
chewie barks a reply as he readjusts an overhead switch
well we can still outmaneuver them
the millennium falcon races toward one of the huge oncoming star destroyers
suddenly the falcon starts into a deep dive straight down closely followed by four tie fighters
the underside of the star destroyer continues on a collision course with two oncoming star destroyers
slowly it starts to veer to the left
out the front window the two approaching star destroyers can be seen veering to the left
take evasive action
alarms sound all over the huge ship
the two other star destroyers get closer one of them moving over the bridge so close that it makes brushing contact with it
the millennium falcon races away from the colliding star destroyers still followed by four tie fighters
laser bolts spark the pitch black skies
things have calmed down a bit but the race isnt over yet
chewie barks at han
leia is still trying to recover from the steep dive
the ship is buffeted by laser blasts
prepare to make the jump to light speed
the buffeting of lasers becomes louder and stronger
theyre getting closer
with a gleam in his eye oh yeah
expectantly they look out the cockpit window as stars do not go into hyperspace but just sit there
han and chewie look at each other and are thrown into an acute state of concern
han tries again
i think were in trouble
if i may say so sir i noticed earlier that the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged
its impossible to go to light speed
were in trouble
the explosions become heavier
the falcon races into the starry vastness followed by the four imperial tie fighters and an imperial star destroyer
stars race by as flak bursts outside the falcons window
han works furiously at some control panels while giving various orders to chewie
chewie barks alluvial dampers
well thats not it
chewie barks bring me the hydrospanners
chewie hurries over to the pit and places the tools on the edge
i dont know how were going to get out of this one
suddenly a loud thump hits the side of the falcon causing it to lurch radically
the tools fall into the pit on top of han
more turbulence rocks the ship
that was no laser blast
something hit us
over comlink han get up here
come on chewie
han climbs out of the hold like a shot
both he and chewie run out of the hold and toward the cockpit
out the front cockpit window they see hundreds of asteroids racing by
han changes places with leia who has been at the controls and chewie gets into his chair
han works his controls as a chunk of rock crosses in front of the ship
chewie set two seven one
what are you doing
youre not actually going into an asteroid field
theyd be crazy to follow us wouldnt they
another asteroid thumps against the ship and leia winces at the jolt
you dont have to do this to impress me
sir the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand seven hundred and twenty to one
never tell me the odds
the falcon turns into the asteroid storm and as the ship completes its turn asteroids start coming straight at the cockpit windows
a large asteroid tumbles away from the falcons path at top speed
several smaller asteroids crash into the big one creating small explosions on its surface
other asteroids of all sizes pass by in every direction some colliding and exploding
the tiny millennium falcon veers around the big asteroid and races past it through the rain of rocks followed by four tie fighters which bob and weave around the asteroids
one of the pursuing tie fighters connects with an asteroid and explodes
the other fighters are pelted with a steady stream of smaller explosions
two huge asteroids tumble toward the millennium falcon which quickly banks around both of them
the three tie fighters follow in hot pursuit until one of the fighters scrapes an asteroid and tumbles out of control into deep space
the massive star destroyer blasts oncoming asteroids as it follows the falcon
smaller asteroids explode across its vast surface
the falcon twists on its side as it races around an oncoming asteroid
two tie fighters follow in the distance coming from either side
asteroids race by the cockpit window as han pilots his trusty craft through the dangerous field
looking out the cockpit window the falcon crew sees a big asteroid drop past the window narrowly missing their ship
chewie barks in terror as a slightly smaller asteroid comes especially close to close and bounces off the falcon with a loud crunch
threepios hands cover his eyes
he manages a short peek at the cockpit window
princess leia sits stone faced staring at the action
han gives her a quick look
you said you wanted to be around when i made a mistake well this could be it sweetheart
i take it back
were going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer
the group watches as more asteroids race by outside the window
im not going to argue with that
im going in closer to one of those big ones
chewbacca barks the same word only louder
the millennium falcon dives toward the surface of one of the moon sized asteroids
there is a continued display of explosions against the starry void as smaller asteroids collide with larger chunks of rock
the two remaining tie fighters follow the falcon to the large asteroid
the falcon skims the surface of the giant asteroid as all the while small asteroids explode on the surface of the ship
the tie fighters approach the falcon but a giant asteroid hurtles directly into their path
as the asteroid continues on its way it leaves remains of the two exploded tie fighters to tumble into deep space
rattled by the violent rocking of the starship threepio is nearly in hysterics
oh this is suicide
han notices something on his main scope and nudges his faithful wookiee pointing
that looks pretty good
what looks pretty good
thatll do nicely
to leia excuse me maam but where are we going
out the cockpit window they see that they are skimming the surface of the enormous asteroid and nearing a large crater
the millennium falcon dives into the huge crater and disappears
i hope you know what youre doing
yeah me too
the falcon races down into the crater
the walls are barely visible as the ship speed through the tunnellike opening
a small cave appears on one side of the crater and the falcon turns slows and scoots into it
the tiny x wing speeds toward the cloud cover of dagobah
artoo riding on the back of the fighter turns his head back and forth with some anxiety
luke watches artoos words as they are translated and screened on the computer scope
into comlink yes thats it
artoo beeps a hopeful inquiry
into comlink no im not going to change my mind about this
getting a little nervous im not picking up any cities or technology
massive life form readings though
theres something alive down there
artoo beeps this time a slightly worried question
into comlink yes im sure its perfectly safe for droids
the x wing continues its flight through the twilight above the cloud covered planet
luke sees the cloud race by as he takes his craft closer to the planet
he must operate his controls carefully since the cloud cover has completely obscured his vision
an alarm buzzes in the background artoo beeps and whistles frantically
into comlink i know i know
all the scopes are dead
i cant see a thing
just hang on im going to start the landing cycle
the blast of the retrorockets is deafening drowning out artoos electronic squeals
suddenly there is a cracking sound as if limbs were being broken off trees and then a tremendous jolt as the spacecraft stops
luke pulls a switch and his canopy pops open
the mist shrouded x wing fighter is almost invisible in the thick fog
luke climbs out onto the long nose of the spacecraft as artoo pops out of his cubbyhole on the back
the young warrior surveys the fog which is barely pierced by the ships landing lights
about all he can make out are some giant twisted trees nearby
artoo whistles anxiously
no artoo you stay put
ill have a look around
artoo lets out a short beep
as luke moves along the nose artoo loses his balance and disappears with a splash into the boggy lake
luke kneels and leans over the plane looking for artoo but the water is still and reveals no sign of the little droid
where are you
a small periscope breaks the surface of the water and a gurgly beep is heard
the periscope starts to move to shore
relieved luke starts running along the nose of the fighter to its tip
you be more careful
the outline of the shore is now more than ten feet away
luke jumps off the plane into the water scrambles up to the shore and turns to look for artoo
the periscope still steadily moves toward shore
artoo that way
suddenly through the thick fog layer a dark shape appears moving toward the little droid
the dark sinuous bog beast dives beneath the swampy water making a loud clunk against artoos metal hull
the droid disappears from sight uttering a pathetic electronic scream
holding his ignited lightsaber before him luke wades a few feet into the murky pool looking for any sign of his little friend
the black surface is still as death itself
until a few bubbles begin to appear
the runt size robot is spit out of the water makes a graceful arc and comes crashing down into a patch of soft gray moss
are you all right
youre lucky you dont taste very good
luke helps artoo to his feet and begins wiping the mud and roots from his round metal body
artoo responds with feeble soggy beeps
if youre saying coming here was a bad idea im beginning to agree with you
oh artoo what are we doing here
something out of a dream or i dont know
maybe im just going crazy
as luke glances around at the spooky swamp jungle that surrounds him artoo ejects a stream of muddy water from one of his cranial ports
admiral piett hesitates in the entryway to vaders private cubicle
after a moment he steps into the room and pauses at the surprising sight before him
darth vader his back turned is silhouetted in the gloom on the far side of the chamber
a black insectlike droid attends him
among the various apparatuses surrounding them a respirator tube now retracts from vaders uncovered head
the head is bald with a mass of ugly scar tissue covering it
the black droid then lowers the mask and helmet onto vaders head
when it is in place the dark lord turns to face piett
our ships have sighted the millennium falcon lord
it has entered an asteroid field and we cannot risk
interrupting asteroids do not concern me admiral
i want that ship and not excuses
the pirate starship rests in a dark dripping asteroid cave
it is so dark that the caves exact dimensions are impossible to determine
han and chewie busily shut down the engine and all electronic systems
threepio and leia watch worriedly
im going to shut down everything but the emergency power systems
sir im almost afraid to ask but
does that include shutting me down too
chewie barks yes
but han thinks otherwise
no i need you to talk to the falcon find out whats wrong with the hyperdrive
suddenly the ship lurches causing all the loose items in the cockpit to go flying
sir its quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable
not entirely stable
im glad youre here to tell us these things
chewie take the professor in the back and plug him into the hyperdrive
sometimes i just dont understand human behavior
after all im only trying to do my job in the most
the sliding door closes behind the indignant threepio as chewie and he move back to the hold
suddenly the ship lurches again throwing leia across the cabin into hans arms
then abruptly the motion stops as suddenly as it started
with some surprise han and leia realize they are in each others arms
let go please
leia flushes averting her eyes
shes not exactly fighting to get free
but of course han blows it
dont get excited
the anger rises in leia
captain being held by you isnt quite enough to get me excited
we havent got time for anything else
han grins quickly wickedly at leia as he turns and exits through the door
leias confused emotions show clearly on her lovely face
the mist has dispersed a bit but it is still a very gloomy looking swamp
luke pulls an equipment box from the shore to the clearing
he ignites a little fusion furnace and warms his hands before it
taking a power cable he plugs it into artoos noselike socket
ready for some power
lets see now
put that in there
there you go
the droid whistles his appreciation
luke then opens a container of processed food and sits before the thermal heater
sighs now all i have to do is find this yoda
if he even exists
nervously he looks around at the foreboding jungle
theres something familiar about this place
i feel like
i dont know
feel like what
luke jumps out of his skin
artoo screeches in terror
the young warrior grabs for his lightsaber as he spins around looking for the speaker
mysteriously standing right in front of luke is a strange bluish creature not more than two feet tall
the wizened little thing is dressed in rags
it motions toward lukes sword
looking at the creature like were being watched
away with your weapon
i mean you no harm
after some hesitation luke puts away his weapon although he really doesnt understand why
artoo watches with interest
i am wondering why are you here
im looking for someone
found someone you have i would say hmmm
the little creature laughs
trying to keep from smiling right
help you i can
i dont think so
im looking for a great warrior
a great warrior
laughs and shakes his head wars not make one great
with the aid of a walking stick the tiny stranger moves over to one of the cases of supplies
he begins to rummage around
artoo moves to the edge of the case standing almost eye level to the creature who is carelessly handling the supplies and squeaks his disapproval
their tiny visitor pick up the container of food luke was eating from and takes a bite
put that down
thats my dinner
the creature spits out the bite he has taken
he makes a face
how you get so big eating food of this kind
he flips the container in lukes direction and reaches into one of lukes supply cases
listen friend we didnt mean to land in that puddle and if we could get our ship out we would but we cant so why dont you just
teasing aww cannot get your ship out
the creature spots something of interest in lukes case
luke loses patience and grabs the case away
the creature retains his prize a tiny power lamp and examines it with delight
hey you could have broken this
dont do that
youre making a mess
hey give me that
retreating with the lamp mine
or i will help you not
clutching its treasure the creature backs away from luke drawing closer to artoo
as luke and the creature argue one of artoos little arms slowly moves out toward the power lamp completely unnoticed by the creature
i dont want your help
i want my lamp back
ill need it to get out of this slimy mudhole
my home this is
artoo grabs hold of the lamp and the two little figures are immediately engaged in a tug of war over it
artoo beeps a few angry give me thats
ah ah ah
oh artoo let him have it
the creature lets go with one hand and pokes artoo lightly with one finger
artoo reacts with a startled squeal and lets go
fed up now will you move along little fella
were got a lot of work to do
stay and help you i will
laughs find your friend hmm
im not looking for a friend
im looking for a jedi master
you seek yoda
you know him
take you to him i will
laughs yes yes
but now we must eat
with that the creature scurries out of the clearing laughing merrily
luke stares after him
all he sees is the faint light from the small power lamp moving through the fog
luke makes his decision and starts after the creature
in the distance come come
artoo very upset whistles a blue streak of protest
stay here and watch after the camp artoo
artoo beeps even more frantically
but as luke disappears from view the worried little droid grows quieter and utters a soft electronic sigh
threepio whistles and beeps a strange dialect into the control panel in front of him
the control panel whistles back a few mystifying beeps
oh where is artoo when i need him
han enters the hold area and kneels on the floor near the control box
sir i dont know where your ship learned to communicate but it has the most peculiar dialect
i believe sir it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized
im afraid youll have to replace it
well of course ill have to replace it
he hands a wire coil up to chewie who is working near the ceiling
chewie brings his head back through the trap door in the ceiling and whines
han glances back at threepio then speaks quietly to chewie so only he can hear
continuing i think wed better replace the negative power coupling
leia finishes welding the valves she has been working on and attempts to reengage the system by pulling a lever attached to the valve
it doesnt budge
han notices her struggle and moves to help her
she rebuffs him
hey your worship im only trying to help
still struggling would you please stop calling me that
han hears a new tone in her voice
he watches her pull on the lever
oh you make it so difficult sometimes
i do i really do
you could be a little nicer though
he watches her reaction come on admit it
sometimes you think im all right
she lets go of the lever and rubs her sore hand
a little smile haltingly when you arent acting like a scoundrel
i like the sound of that
with that han takes her hand and starts to massage it
leia is flushes confused
my hands are dirty
my hands are dirty too
what are you afraid of
looking right into his eyes afraid
han looks at her with a piercing look
hes never looked more handsome more dashing more confident
he reaches out slowly and takes leias hand again from where it is resting on a console
he draws it toward him
im not trembling
then with an irresistible combination of physical strength and emotional power the space pirate begins to draw leia toward him
you like me because im a scoundrel
there arent enough scoundrels in your life
leia is now very close to han and as she speaks her voice becomes an excited whisper a tone completely in opposition to her words
i happen to like nice men
im a nice man
no youre not
he kisses her now with slow hot lips
he takes his time as though he had forever bending her body backward
she has never been kissed like this before and it almost makes her faint
when he stops she regains her breath and tries to work up some indignation but finds it hard to talk
suddenly threepio appears in the doorway speaking excitedly
ive isolated the reverse power flux coupling
han turns slowly icily from their embrace
thank you very much
oh youre perfectly welcome sir
the moment spoiled han marches out after threepio
the imperial fleet moves through the asteroid filled void intently seeking its prey
asteroids collide creating a fireworks display outside the bridge window
darth vader stands staring out the window above the control deck
then slowly turns toward the bridge
before him are the hologram images of twenty battleship commanders
one of these images the commander of a ship that has just exploded is fading away quickly
another image in the center and a little apart from the others is faded and continually disrupted by static
it is the image of captain needa commander of the star destroyer most hotly on the tail of the millennium falcon
admiral piett and an aide stand behind the dark lord
in hologram and that lord vader was the last time they appeared in any of our scopes
considering the amount of damage weve sustained they must have been destroyed
no captain theyre alive
i want every ship available to sweep the asteroid field until they are found
the imperial star captains fade out one by one as vader turns to admiral piett
yes admiral what is it
the admiral is scared his face white as a sheet
the emperor commands you make contact with him
move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a clear transmission
yes my lord
vaders imperial star destroyer moves against the vast sea of stars away from the rest of the fleet
the dark lord darth vader is alone in his chamber
a strange sound enters the room and a light begins to play across vaders black figure
he looks up and bows quickly
a twelve foot hologram of the galactic emperor materializes before vader
the emperors dark robes and monks hood are reminiscent of the cloak worn by ben kenobi
his voice is even deeper and more frightening than vaders
what is thy bidding my master
there is a great disturbance in the force
i have felt it
we have a new enemy luke skywalker
yes my master
he could destroy us
hes just a boy
obi wan can no longer help him
the force is strong with him
the son of skywalker must not become a jedi
if he could be turned he would become a powerful ally
he would be a great asset
can it be done
he will join us or die my master
the supreme emperor passes a hand over the crouched lord of the sith and fades away
a heavy downpour of rain pounds through the gnarled trees
a strange baroque mud house sits on a moss covered knoll on the edge of a small lagoon
the small gnomish structure radiates a warm glow from its thick glass windows
as rain tap dances a merry tune on artoos head the stubby little droid rises up on his tip toes to peek into one of the glowing portals
artoo peeking in the window sees the inside of the house a very plain but cozy dwelling
everything is in the same small scale as the creature
the only thing out of place in the miniature room is luke whose height makes the four foot ceiling seem even lower
he sits cross legged on the floor of the living room
the creature is in an adjoining area his little kitchen cooking up an incredible meal
the stove is a steaming hodgepodge of pots and pans
the wizened little host scurries about chopping this shredding that and showering everything with exotic herbs and spices
he rushes back and forth putting platters on the table in front of luke who watches the creature impatiently
look im sure its delicious
i just dont understand why we cant see yoda now
for the jedi it is time to eat as well
good food hm
moving with some difficulty in the cramped quarters luke sits down near the fire and serves himself from the pot
tasting the unfamiliar concoction he is pleasantly surprised
how far away is yoda
will it take us long to get there
yoda not far
soon you will be with him
tasting food from the pot rootleaf i cook
why wish you become jedi
mostly because of my father i guess
ah your father
powerful jedi was he powerful jedi mmm
a little angry oh come on
how could you know my father
you dont even know who i am
fed up oh i dont know what im doing here
were wasting our time
the creature turns away from luke and speaks to a third party
irritated i cannot teach him
the boy has no patience
lukes head spins in the direction the creature faces
but there is no one there
the boy is bewildered but it gradually dawns on him that the little creature is yoda the jedi master and that he is speaking with ben
he will learn patience
much anger in him like his father
was i any different when you taught me
he is not ready
i am ready
i can be a jedi
ben tell him im ready
trying to see ben luke starts to get up but hits his head on the low ceiling
ready are you
what know you of ready
for eight hundred years have i trained jedi
my own counsel will i keep on who is to be trained
a jedi must have the deepest commitment the most serious mind
to the invisible ben indicating luke this one a long time have i watched
all his life has he looked away
to the future to the horizon
never his mind on where he was
what he was doing
a jedi craves not these things
turning to luke you are reckless
luke looks down
he knows it is true
so was i if youll remember
he is too old
yes too old to begin the training
luke thinks he detects a subtle softening in yodas voice
but ive learned so much
yoda turns his piercing gaze on luke as though the jedi masters huge eyes could somehow determine how much the boy had learned
after a long moment the little jedi turns toward where he alone sees ben
sighs will he finished what he begins
i wont fail you im not afraid
turns slowly toward him oh you will be
you will be
the imperial fleet around vaders ship is surrounded by the asteroid storm
asteroids big and small pelt the vast exteriors of the menacing ships
one of the smaller imperial vessels is hit by a huge asteroid and explodes in a brilliant flash of light
the cockpit is quiet and lit only by the indicator lights on the control panel
princess leia sits in the pilots seat
she runs her hand across the control panel as she thinks of han and the confusion he has created within her
suddenly something outside the cockpit window catches her eye
the reflection of the panel lights obscures her vision until a soft suctionlike cup attaches itself to the windscreen
leia moves closer to see what it might be
large yellow eyes flash open and stare back at her
startled she jumps back into her seat her heart pounding
there is a scurry of feet and a loud screech and in an instant the eyes are gone
the young princess catches her breath jumps out of her chair and races from the cockpit
the lights go bright for a second then out again
threepio and chewbacca watch as han finishes with some wires
sir if i may venture an opinion
im not really interested in your opinion threepio
leia rushes into the cabin just as han drops the final floor panel into place
out of breath theres something out there
outside in the cave
as she speaks there comes a sharp banging on the hull
chewie looks up and barks anxiously
there it is
im going out there
are you crazy
i just got this bucket back together
im not going to let something tear it apart
he and chewie grab their breath masks off a rack and hurry out
then im going with you
i think it might be better if i stay here and guard the ship
hears another mysterious noise oh no
it is very dark inside the huge asteroid cave too dark to see what is attacking the ship
leia stamps her foot on the floor of the cave
this ground sure feels strange
it doesnt feel like rock at all
han kneels and studies the ground then attempts to study the outline of the cave
theres an awful lot of moisture in here
i dont know
i have a bad feeling about this
chewie barks through his face mask and points toward the ships cockpit
a five foot long shape can be seen moving across the top of the falcon
the leathery creature lets out a screech as han blasts it with a laser bolt
to leia watch out
the black shape tumbles off the spaceship and onto the ground in front of the princess
han bends down to investigate the dead creature
yeah thats what i thought
chewie check the rest of the ship make sure there arent any more attached
theyre chewing on the power cables
go on inside
well clean them off if there are any more
just then a swarm of the ugly creatures swoops through the air
leia puts her arms over her head to protect herself as she runs toward the ship
chewie shoos another mynock away with his blaster
several of the batlike creatures flap their wings loudly against the cockpit window of the falcon
inside threepio shudders at their presence
beastly little thing
han looks around the strange dripping cave
wait a minute
he unholsters his blaster and fires at the far side of the huge cave
the cavern begins to shake and the ground starts to buckle
chewie barks and moves for the ship followed closely by leia and han
the large wings of the mynocks flap past them as they protect their faces and run up the platform
as soon as han and leia are on board chewie closes the main hatch
the ship continues to shake and heave
all right chewie lets get out of here
the wookiee heads for the cockpit as han followed by threepio rushes to the hold area and checks the scopes on the control panel
leia hurries after
the empire is still out there
i dont think its wise to
han rushes past her and heads for the cockpit
interrupting no time to discuss this in committee
and with that he is gone
the main engines of the falcon begin to whine
leia races after him bouncing around in the shaking ship
angry i am not a committee
han is already in the pilots seat pulling back on the throttle
the cave quake has greatly diminished
you cant make the jump to light speed in this asteroid field
sit down sweetheart
were taking off
as the ship begins to move forward chewie barks
he notices something out the window ahead
threepio sees it too
i see it i see it
suddenly a row of jagged white stalagmites and stalactites can be seen surrounding the entrance
and as the falcon moves forward the entrance to the cave grows ever smaller
han pulls hard on the throttle sending his ship surging forward
the cave is collapsing
this is no cave
leias mouth drops open
she sees that the rocks of the cave entrance are not rocks at all but giant teeth quickly closing around the tiny ship
the millennium falcon zooming through the monsters mouth rolls on its side and barely makes it between two of the gigantic white teeth before the huge jaws slams closed
the enormous space slug moves its head out of the cave as the falcon flies out of its mouth
the monster tilts its head watching the starship fly away
the falcon races out of the asteroid crater and into the deadly rain of the asteroid storm
with yoda strapped to his back luke climbs up one of the many thick vines that grow in the swamp
panting heavily he continues his course climbing flipping through the air jumping over roots and racing in and out of the heavy ground fog
a jedis strength flows from the force
but beware of the dark side
the dark side of the force are they
easily they flow quick to join you in a fight
if once you start down the dark path forever will it dominate your destiny consume you it will as it did obi wans apprentice
is the dark side stronger
quicker easier more seductive
but how am i to know the good side from the bad
you will know
when you are calm at peace
a jedi uses the force for knowledge and defense never for attack
but tell me why i cant
interrupting no no there is no why
nothing more will i teach you today
clear your mind of questions
artoo beeps in the distance as luke lets yoda down to the ground
breathing heavily he takes his shirt from a nearby tree branch and pulls it on
he turns to see a huge dead black tree its base surrounded by a few feet of water
giant twisted roots form a dark and sinister cave on one side
luke stares at the tree trembling
theres something not right here
yoda sits on a large root poking his gimer stick into the dirt
i feel cold death
is strong with the dark side of the force
a domain of evil it is
in you must go
whats in there
only what you take with you
luke looks warily between the tree and yoda
he starts to strap on his weapon belt
you will not need them
luke gives the tree a long look than shakes his head no
luke reaches up to brush aside some hanging vines and enters the tree
luke moves into the almost total darkness of the wet and slimy cave
the youth can barely make out the edge of the passage
holding his lit saber before him he sees a lizard crawling up the side of the cave and a snake wrapped around the branches of a tree
luke draws a deep breath then pushes deeper into the cave
the space widens around him but he feels that rather than sees it
his sword casts the only light as he peers into the darkness
it is very quiet here
then a loud hiss
darth vader appears across the blackness illuminated by his own just ignited laser sword
immediately he charges luke saber held high
he is upon the youth in seconds but luke sidesteps perfectly and slashes at vader with his sword
vader is decapitated
his helmet encased head flies from his shoulders as his body disappears into the darkness
the metallic banging of the helmet fills the cave as vaders head spins and bounces smashes on the floor and finally stops
for an instant it rests on the floor then it cracks vertically
the black helmet and breath mask fall away to reveal
across the space the standing luke gasps at the sight wide eyed in terror
the decapitated head fades away as in a vision
meanwhile yoda sits on the root calmly leaning on his gimer stick
vaders imperial star destroyer moves through space guarded by its convoy of tie fighters
vader stands in the back control area of his ships bridge with a motley group of men and creatures
admiral piett and two controllers stand at the front of the bridge and watch the group with scorn
we dont need that scum
those rebels wont escape us
a second controller interrupts
sir we have a priority signal from the star destroyer avenger
the group standing before vader is a bizarre array of galactic fortune hunters there is bossk a slimy tentacled monster with two huge bloodshot eyes in a soft baggy face
zuckuss and dengar two battle scarred mangy human types ig a battered tarnished chrome war droid and boba fett a man in a weapon covered armored space suit
there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the millennium falcon
you are free to use any methods necessary but i want them alive
as you wish
at that moment admiral piett approaches vader in a rush of excitement
my lord we have them
the millennium falcon speeds through deep space closely followed by a firing imperial star destroyer
a large asteroid about the same size as the falcon tumbles rapidly toward the starship
the tiny falcon banks to avoid the giant asteroid as smaller rocks pelt its surface
then the small craft roars under the asteroid which explodes harmlessly on the hull of the vast star destroyer
the ship shudders as flak explodes near the cockpit window
threepio checks a tracking scope an the side control panel while leia watches tensely out the window
oh thank goodness were coming out of the asteroid field
chewie barks excitedly as the rain of asteroids begins to subside
a bolt from the star destroyer sets up a fiery explosion on the back side of the falcon causing it to lurch to one side
the falcon is hit hard by another bolt from the star destroyer which creates a huge explosion near the cockpit of the smaller ship
the falcon tilts steeply then rights itself
han corrects the angle of his ship
lets get out of here
ready for light speed
han pulls back on the hyperspace throttle and nothing happens
flak bursts continue to rock the ship
frantic its not fair
chewie is very angry and starts to growl and bark at his friend and captain
again han desperately pulls back on the throttle
the transfer circuits are working
its not my fault
chewie puts his head in his hands whining
almost expecting it no light speed
its not my fault
sir we just lost the main rear deflector shield
one more direct hit on the back quarter and were done for
han pauses for a moment makes a decision and pulls back on a lever
turn her around
chewie barks in puzzlement
i said turn her around
im going to put all power in the front shield
youre going to attack them
sir the odds of surviving a direct assault on an imperial star destroyer
the falcon banks makes a steep twisting turn
in the next moment it is racing toward the star destroyer looking very small against the massive surface of the imperial ship
as it moves across the surface of the star destroyer the falcon bobs and weaves to avoid the numerous flak bursts
the tiny falcon heads directly for the avengers bridge
the imperials stationed there are stunned to see the small spaceship racing low across the hull headed directly at the huge windows of the bridge area
alarms go off everywhere
the destroyers commander captain needa can scarcely believe his eyes
theyre moving to attack position
needa and his men duck as the falcon nears the bridge window
at the last minute the falcon veers off and out of sight
all is quiet
they may come around for another pass
captain needa the ship no longer appears on our scopes
they cant have disappeared
no ship that small has a cloaking device
well theres no trace of them sir
captain lord vader demands an update on the pursuit
drawing a breath get a shuttle ready
i shall assume full responsibility for losing them and apologize to lord vader
meanwhile continue to scan the area
yes captain needa
lukes face is upside down and showing enormous strain
he stands on his hands with yoda perched on his feet
opposite luke and yoda are two rocks the size of bowling balls
luke stares at the rocks and concentrates
one of the rocks lifts from the ground and floats up to rest on the other
use the force
yoda taps lukes leg
quickly luke lifts one hand from the ground
his body wavers but he maintains his balance
artoo standing nearby is whistling and beeping frantically
luke concentrates on trying to lift the top rock
it rises a few feet shaking under the strain
but distracted by artoos frantic beeping luke loses his balance and finally collapses
yoda jumps clear
annoyed at the disturbance luke looks over at artoo who is rocking urgently back and forth in front of him
artoo waddles closer to luke chirping wildly then scoots over the edge of the swamp
catching on luke rushes to the waters edge
the x wing fighter has sunk and only the tip of its nose shows above the lakes surface
well never get it out now
yoda stamps his foot in irritation
so certain are you
always with you it cannot be done
hear you nothing that i say
luke looks uncertainly out at the ship
master moving stones around is one thing
this is totally different
only different in your mind
you must unlearn what you have learned
focusing quietly all right ill give it a try
or do not
there is no try
luke closes his eyes and concentrates on thinking the ship out
slowly the x wings nose begins to rise above the water
it hovers for a moment and then slides back disappearing once again
panting heavily i cant
its too big
size matters not
look at me
judge me by my size do you
luke shakes his head
and well you should not
for my ally in the force
and a powerful ally it is
life creates it makes it grow
its energy surrounds us and binds us
luminous beings are we
yoda pinches lukes shoulder not this crude matter
a sweeping gesture you must feel the force around you
gesturing here between you
yes even between this land and that ship
discouraged you want the impossible
quietly yoda turns toward the x wing fighter
with his eyes closed and his head bowed he raises his arm and points at the ship
soon the fighter rises above the water and moves forward as artoo beeps in terror and scoots away
the entire x wing moves majestically surely toward the shore
yoda stands on a tree root and guides the fighter carefully down toward the beach
luke stares in astonishment as the fighter settles down onto the shore
he walks toward yoda
i dont believe it
that is why you fail
luke shakes his head bewildered
the fleet around vaders star destroyer now includes needas star destroyer the avenger
apology accepted captain needa
clutching desperately at his throat captain needa slumps down then falls over on his back at the feet of darth vader
two stormtroopers pick up the lifeless body and carry it quickly away as admiral piett and two of his captains hurry up to the dark lord
lord vader our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing
if the millennium falcon went into light speed itll be on the other side of the galaxy by now
alert all commands
calculate every possible destination along their last know trajectory
yes my lord
well find them
dont fail me again admiral
vader exits as the admiral turns to an aide a little more uneasy than when he arrived
alert all commands
deploy the fleet
vaders ship moves away flanked by its fleet of smaller ships
the avenger glides off into space in the opposite direction
no one on that ship or on vaders is aware that clinging to the side of the avenger is the pirateship the millennium falcon
captain solo this time you have gone too far
chewie growls no i will not be quiet chewbacca
why doesnt anyone listen to me
to chewie the fleet is beginning to break up
go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw
chewie barks struggles from his seat and climbs out of the cabin
i really dont see how that is going to help
surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances
the empire may be gracious enough
leia reaches over and shuts off threepio mid sentence
what did you have in mind for your next move
well if they follow standard imperial procedure theyll dump their garbage before they go to light speed then we just float away
with the rest of the garbage
then weve got to find a safe port somewhere around here
got any ideas
where are we
the anoat system
theres not much there
this is interesting
he points to a computer mapscreen on the control panel
leia slips out of her chair and moves next to the handsome pilot
small light points representing several systems flash by on the computer screen
landos not a system hes a man
hes a card player gambler scoundrel
youd like him
its pretty far but i think we can make it
reading from the computer a mining colony
yeah a tibanna gas mine
lando conned somebody out of it
we go back a long way lando and me
can you trust him
but he has no love for the empire i can tell you that
chewie barks over the intercom
han quickly changes his readouts and stretches to look out the cockpit window
into intercom here we go chewie
han leans back in his chair and gives leia an invisible smile
she thinks for a moment shakes her head a grin creeps across her face and she gives him a quick kiss
you do have your moments
not many but you have them
as the avenger star destroyer moves slowly into space the hatch on its underbelly opens sending a trail of junk behind it
hidden among the refuse the falcon tumbles away
in the next moment the avenger roars off into hyperspace
the falcons engines are ignited and it races off into the distance
amidst the slowly drifting junk boba fetts ship appears and moves after the falcon
in the clearing behind yodas house luke again stands upside down but his face shows less strain and more concentration than before
yoda sits on the ground below the young warrior
on the other side of the clearing two equipment cases slowly rise into the air
nearby artoo watches humming to himself when suddenly he too rises into the air
his little legs kick desperately and his head turns frantically looking for help
feel the force flow
through the force things you will see
old friends long gone
luke suddenly becomes distressed
the two packing boxes and artoo fall to the ground with a crash then luke himself tumbles over
shaking his head hmm
you must learn control
i saw a city in the clouds
friends you have there
they were in pain
it is the future you see
will they die
yoda closes his eyes and lowers his head
difficult to see
always in motion is the future
ive got to go to them
decide you must how to serve them best
if you leave now help them you could
but you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered
luke is stopped cold by yodas words
gloom shrouds him as he nods his head sadly
the powerful pirate starship blasts through space as it heads toward the soft pink planet of bespin
it is down on the gaseous planet
huge billowing clouds form a canyon as the ship banks around them heading toward the systems cloud city
suddenly two twin pod cloud cars appear and move toward the falcon
the cloud cars draw up alongside the starship
one of the cloud cars opens fire on the falcon its flak rocking the ship
chewie barks his concern
into transmitter no i dont have a landing permit
im trying to reach lando calrissian
more flak bursts outside the cockpit window and rattles the ships interior
leia looks worried
into transmitter whoa
wait a minute
let me explain
you will not deviate from your present course
rather touchy arent they
i thought you knew this person
chewie barks and growls at his boss
to chewie well that was a long time ago
im sure hes forgotten about that
permission granted to land on platform three two seven
into transmitter thank you
angry han snaps off the intercom
chewie looks at him and grunts
han turns to the worried princess and her droid
theres nothing to worry about
we go way back lando and me
leia doesnt look convinced
the clouds part to reveal a full view of the city as it bobs in and out of the cloud surface
the cloud cars and the falcon head for the gleaming white metropolis
with the cloud cars still guarding it the falcon lands on one of the cloud citys platforms
han and leia stand at the open door armed
behind them chewie also armed surveys the scene warily
no one to meet us
i dont like this
well what would you like
well they did let us land
look dont worry
everythings going to be fine
lando calrissian a suave dashing black man in his thirties leads a group of aides and some cloud city guard rapidly toward the landing platform
the group like the other citizens of the city is a motley collection of aliens droids and humans of all descriptions
lando has a grim expression on his face as he moves onto the landing platform
to chewie keep your eyes open okay
chewie growls as han walks down the ramp
lando and his men head across the bridge to meet the space pirate
lando stops ten feet from han
the two men eye each other carefully
lando shakes his head
why you slimy double crossing no good swindler
youve got a lot of guts coming here after what you pulled
han points to himself innocently mouthing me
lando moves threateningly toward han
suddenly he throws his arms around his startled long lost friend and embraces him
laughs how you doing you old pirate
so good to see you
i never thought id catch up with you again
where you been
the two old friends embrace laughing and chuckling
well he seems very friendly
what are you doing here
gestures toward the falcon ahh
i thought you could help me out
in mock panic what have you done to my ship
hey remember you lost her to me fair and square
chewie growls a reserved greeting
lando suddenly notices the princess and smiles
what have we here
im lando calrissian
im the administrator of this facility
and who might you be
lando bows before leia and kisses her hand
all right all right you old smoothie
han takes leia by the hand and steers her away from lando
i am see threepio human cyborg relations
my facilities are at your
before threepio can finish his self introduction lando has turned to follow han and leia who are walking toward the city
lando his aide lobot and han lead the way across the bridge followed by threepio chewie and leia
whats wrong with the falcon
ill get my people to work on it
lando turns to leia
you know that ship saved my life quite a few times
shes the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy
the group has crossed the narrow bridge and entered the city
they walk down the lovely art deco passageway rounding several corners and passing many small plazas as they go
threepio lags a bit behind
hows the gas mine
is it paying off for you
oh not as well as id like
were a small outpost and not very self sufficient
and ive had supply problems of every kind
ive had labor difficulties
catches han grinning at him whats so funny
listen to you you sound like a businessman a responsible leader
whod have thought that huh
lando is reflective
he looks at han a moment
you know seeing you sure brings back a few things
shakes his head yeah
im responsible these days
its the price you pay for being successful
han and lando laugh together and the group moves on through the corridor
the lagging threepio passes a threepio type silver droid who is coming out of a door
nice to see a familiar face
mumbles e chu ta
threepio stops watching the silver droid move away
then he hears the muffled beeping and whistling of an r unit coming from within the room
curious threepio enters the room
that sounds like an r unit in there
i wonder if
threepio walks through the doorway to the main room
he looks in
from within who are you
oh im terribly sorry
i didnt mean to intrude
no no please dont get up
a laser bolt to threepios chest sends him flying in twenty directions
smoldering mechanical arms and legs bounce off the walls as the door whooshes closed behind him
lando han and leia continue down the corridor unaware of threepios dreadful accident
chewbacca glances around sniffs the air but shrugs his shoulders and follows the group
in the bright lights of the fighter luke loads a heavy case into the belly of the ship
artoo sits on top of the x wing settling down into his cubbyhole
yoda stands nearby on a log
you must complete the training
i cant keep the vision out of my head
theyre my friends
ive got to help them
you must not go
but han and leia will die if i dont
you dont know that
luke looks toward the voice in amazement
ben has materialized as a real slightly shimmering image near yoda
the power of his presence stops luke
even yoda cannot see their fate
but i can help them
i feel the force
but you cannot control it
this is a dangerous time for you when you will be tempted by the dark side of the force
to obi wan you listen
remember your failure at the cave
but ive learned so much since then
master yoda i promise to return and finish what ive begun
you have my word
it is you and your abilities the emperor wants
that is why your friends are made to suffer
and that is why i have to go
luke i dont want to lose you to the emperor the way i lost vader
stopped they must be
on this all depends
only a fully trained jedi knight with the force as his ally will conquer vader and his emperor
if you end your training now if you choose the quick and easy path as vader did you will become an agent of evil
and sacrifice han and leia
if you honor what they fight for yes
luke is in great anguish
he struggles with the dilemma a battle raging in his mind
if you choose to face vader you will do it alone
i cannot interfere
he moves to his x wing artoo fire up the converters
artoo whistles a happy reply
luke dont give in to hate that leads to the dark side
luke nods and climbs into his ship
strong is vader
mind what you have learned
save you it can
and ill return
artoo closes the cockpit
ben and yoda stand watching as the roar of the engines and the wind engulf them
sighs told you i did
reckless is he
now matters are worse
that boy is our last hope
looks up no
there is another
lukes tiny x wing rockets away from the green planet of dagobah and off into space
within the quarters assigned her on cloud city leia paces in agitation
she has changed from her cold weather pants and jacket to a lovely dress
her hair is down tied back with ribbons
she moves from a large open window and turns to see han entering through the doorway
the ship is almost finished
two or three more things and were in great shape
the sooner the better
somethings wrong here
no one has seen or knows anything about threepio
hes been gone too long to have gotten lost
han takes leia by the shoulders and gently kisses her forehead
ill talk to lando and see what i can find out
i dont trust lando
well i dont trust him either
but he is my friend
besides well soon be gone
and then youre as good as gone arent you
not speaking han considers her words and gazes at her troubled face
the room is piled high with broken and discarded machine parts
four ugnaughts small hoglike creatures separate the junk and throw some pieces onto a conveyer belt which moves briskly toward a pit of molten metal
pieces of threepios golden body move down the belt
chewie enters the room and spots an ugnaught picking up and inspecting threepios head
the wookiee barks a command startling the ugnaught then reaches to grab the head
but the ugnaught tosses it away from him to another ugnaught
this game of keep away goes on until threepios head falls from their grip and bounces with a clang onto the ground
the door zaps open
chewbacca walks in carrying a packing case of threepio arms and legs hanging over the edge
chewie sets the case on a table grunting and groaning an explanation
found him in a junk pile
oh what a mess
chewie do you think you can repair him
the giant wookiee studies the array of robot parts
he looks at the princess and shrugs sadly
landos got people who can fix him
there is a buzz and the door slides open revealing lando
am i interrupting anything
you look absolutely beautiful
you truly belong here with us among the clouds
coolly thank you
will you join me for a little refreshment
han looks at lando suspiciously but chewie barks at the mention of food and licks his lips
everyones invited of course
leia takes landos proffered arm and the group turns to go
lando spots threepios remains
having trouble with you droid
han and leia exchange a quick glance
han and leia move arm in arm through the door followed by lando and chewie
the door slides closed behind them
leia walks between han and lando as chewie follows a short distance behind
long shafts of light pour across the corridor between tall pure white columns
so you see since were a small operation we dont fall into the
jurisdiction of the empire
so youre part of the mining guild then
no not actually
our operation is small enough not to be noticed
which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves
the group walks into another corridor and heads for a huge doorway at the far end
arent you afraid the empires going to find out about this little operation and shut you down
thats always been a danger looming like a shadow over everything weve built here
but things have developed that will insure security
ive just made a deal that will keep the empire out of here forever
the mighty doors to the dining room slide open and the group enters the dining room
at the far end of a huge banquet table sits darth vader
standing at his side and slightly behind him is boba fett the bounty hunter
faster than the wink of an eye han draws his blaster and pops off a couple of shots directly at vader
the dark lord quickly raises his hand deflecting the bolts into one of the side walls where they explode harmlessly
just as quickly hans weapon zips into vaders hand
the evil presence calmly places the gun on the table in front of him
we would be honored if you would join us
han gives lando a mean look
i had no choice
they arrived right before you did
im sorry too
lukes x wing races through thick clouds toward cloud city
luke is grim faced as he pilots his course toward bespins shining city
artoos beeps and whistles are transmitted onto the scope
into comlink no threepios with them
artoo whistles another worried inquiry
into comlink just hang on
were almost there
chewbacca is in a cloud city prison cell
the stark room is flooded with hot light
to add to chewies misery a high pitched whistle screeches loudly
chewie is going mad
he hits the wall with giant fists as he paces back and forth across the cell floor
the upper lights go off abruptly
the prisoner rubs his eyes and moves to a wall where he listens for a moment
then moaning to himself he moves to a platform where the disassembled pieces of threepio lie
he picks up the golden droids head and meditates on it for a moment barking a few philosophical remarks
chewie sticks the robots head on its torso and starts adjusting wires and circuits
suddenly the lights in threepios eyes spark to life as chewie touches two connectors together
threepio immediately begins to speak but his voice is so slow and so low as to be nearly unintelligible
uh i uh take this off
i uh dont mean to intrude here
i dont no no no
please dont get up
chewie looks at threepio in bewilderment then scratches his furry head
he gets an idea and adjusts some connections whereupon threepio immediately begins speaking normally
were in danger
i must tell the others
ive been shot
darth vader strides through the room as two stormtroopers prepare an elaborate torture mechanism
han is strapped to a rack which tilts forward onto the torture device
vader activates the mechanism creating two bursts of sparks one of which strikes hans face
the door opens and vader leaves the torture room just as han screams a sharp piercing cry of agony
darth vader moves to the holding chamber where lando and boba fett await him
to fett you may take captain solo to jabba the hut after i have skywalker
hans screams filter through the torture room door
hes no good to me dead
he will not be permanently damaged
lord vader what about leia and the wookiee
they must never again leave this city
that was never a condition of our agreement nor was giving han to this bounty hunter
perhaps you think youre being treated unfairly
it would be unfortunate if i had to leave a garrison here
vader turns and sweeps into the elevator with boba fett
lando walks swiftly down another corridor muttering to himself
this deals getting worse all the time
chewie now has a little more of threepio back together
one arm is connected but the legs are yet to be attached
there is one small problem however
it seems the wookiee has managed to put the droids head on backwards
oh yes thats very good
i like that
somethings not right because now i cant see
what have you done
im backwards you stupid furball
only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough
threepio is cut off in mid sentence as chewie angrily deactivates a circuit and the droid shuts down
the wookiee smells something and sits up
the door to the chamber slides open and a ragged han solo is shoved into the room by two stormtroopers
barking his concern the huge wookiee gives han a big hug
han is very pale with dark circles under his eyes
i feel terrible
chewie helps han to a platform and then turns as the door slides open revealing leia
she too looks a little worse for wear
the troopers push her into the cell and the door slides closed
she moves to han who is lying on the platform and kneels next to him gently stroking his head
why are they doing this
they never even asked me any questions
the cell door slides open
lando and two of his guards enter
get out of here lando
shut up and listen
vader has agreed to turn leia and chewie over to me
over to you
theyll have to stay here but at least theyll be safe
what about han
vaders giving him to the bounty hunter
vader wants us all dead
he doesnt want you at all
hes after somebody called skywalker
lord vader has set a trap for him
leias mind is racing
and were the bait
well hes on his way
hans rage peaks
you fixed us all pretty good didnt you
spits it out my friend
han hauls off and punches lando
the two friends are instantly engaged in a frantic close quarters fight
the guards hit han with their rifle butts and he flies across the room
chewie growls and starts for the guards
they point their laser weapons at the giant wookiee but lando stops them
ive done all i can
im sorry i couldnt do better but i have my own problems
yeah youre a real hero
lando and the guards leave
han wipes the blood from his chin as leia and chewie help him up
dabs at his wound you certainly have a way with people
four armor suited stormtroopers stand at the ready in the large chamber which is filled with pipes and chemical tanks
in the middle of the room is a round pit housing a hydraulic platform
darth vader and lando stand near the platform
this facility is crude but it should be adequate to freeze skywalker for his journey to the emperor
an imperial soldier appears
lord vader ship approaching
x wing class
monitor skywalker and allow him to land
the soldier bows and leaves the chamber
lord vader we only use this facility for carbon freezing
if you put him in there it might kill him
i do not want the emperors prize damaged
we will test it
on captain solo
landos face registers dismay
lukes x wing moves through the clouds as it nears the city
encountering no city guards luke scans the display panel with concern
there is a great activity on the carbon freezing platform
six ugnaughts frantically prepare the chamber for use
a special coffinlike container is put in place
with boba fett in the lead a squad of six stormtroopers brings in han leia and chewie
strapped to chewies back with only his head torso and one arm assembled is threepio
threepios head faces the opposite direction from chewies and the droid is constantly twisting around in a vain effort to see what is happening
his one attached arm is animate and expressive intermittently pointing gesturing and covering his eyes
the remaining pieces of his body are randomly bundled to the wookiees back so that his legs and other arm stick out at odd angles from the pack
if only you had attached my legs i wouldnt be in this ridiculous position
now remember chewbacca you have a responsibility to me so dont do anything foolish
to lando whats going on
youre being put into carbon freeze
boba fett moves away from the group to darth vader
what if he doesnt survive
hes worth a lot to me
the empire will compensate you if he dies
put him in
realizing what is about to happen chewie lets out a wild howl and attacks the stormtroopers surrounding han
within seconds other imperial reinforcements join the scuffle clubbing the giant wookiee with their laser weapons
from the instant of chewies first move threepio begins to scream in panic while he tries to protect himself with his one arm
no no no
stop chewbacca stop
the stormtroopers are about to bash chewie in the face
stop chewie stop
do you hear me
yes stop please
im not ready to die
han breaks away from his captors
vader nods to the guards to let him go and the pirate breaks up the fight
chewie this wont help me
han gives the wookiee a stern look
save your strength
therell be another time
the princess you have to take care of her
you hear me
han winks at the wookiee who wails a doleful farewell
in a flash the guards have slipped binders on chewbacca who is too distraught to protest
han turns to princess leia
they look sorrowfully at one another then han moves toward her and gives her a final passionate kiss
i love you
tears roll down leias face as she watches the dashing pirate walk to the hydraulic platform
han looks one final time at his friends and then suddenly the platform drops
leia turns away in agony
lando winces in sorrow it makes a life changing impression on him
instantly fiery liquid begins to pour down in a shower of sparks and fluid as great as any steel furnace
holding leia chewie half turns away from the sight giving threepio a view of the procedure
whats going on
turn round chewbacca i cant see
theyve encased him in carbonite
he should be quite well protected if he survives the freezing process that is
chewie is in no mood for technical discussion he gives the droid an angry glance and bark
a huge mechanical tong lifts the steaming metal encased space pirate out of the vat and stands him on the platform
some ugnaughts rush over and push the block over onto the platform
they slide the coffinlike structure to the block and lift the metal block placing it inside
they then attach an electronic box onto the structure and step away
lando kneels and adjusts some knobs measuring the heat
he shakes his head in relief
well calrissian did he survive
yes hes alive
and in perfect hibernation
vader turns to boba fett
hes all yours bounty hunter
reset the chamber for skywalker
skywalker has just landed my lord
see to it that he finds his way here
calrissian take the princess and the wookiee to my ship
you said theyd be left in the city under my supervision
i am altering the deal
pray i dont alter it any further
landos hand instinctively goes to his throat as he turns to leia chewie and threepio
as luke and artoo move carefully down a deserted corridor they hear a group of people coming down a side hallway
artoo lets out an excited series of beeps and whistles
luke glares at the tiny droid who stops in his tracks with a feeble squeak
boba fett enters from a side hallway followed by two guards pushing the floating encased body of han solo
two stormtroopers who follow immediately spot luke and open fire on him
the youth draws his weapon and blasts the two troopers before they can get off a second shot
the two guards whisk han into another hallway as fett lowers his arm and fires a deadly laser at luke which explodes to one side and tears up a huge
chunk of wall
luke rushes to a side hallway but by the time he reaches it fett han and the guards are gone
a think metal door blocks the passage
luke turns to see leia chewie threepio and lando being herded down a second hallway by several other stormtroopers
leia turns just in time to see luke
luke dont its a trap
its a trap
before she can finish she is pulled through a doorway and disappears from sight
luke races after the group leaving little artoo trailing behind
luke runs into an anteroom and stops to get his bearings
leia and the others are nowhere to be seen
behind luke artoo scoots down the corridor toward the anteroom when suddenly a giant metal door comes slamming down cutting off lukes exit
several more doors clang shut echoing through the chamber
artoo stands with his nose pressed against the giant metal door
he whistles a long sigh of relief and a little dazed wanders off in the other direction
luke cautiously walks forward among hissing pipes and steam
seeing an opening above him he stops to look up
as he does the platform he stands on begins to move
luke rises into the chamber borne by the platform
the room is deathly quiet
very little steam escapes the pipes and no one else seems to be in the large room
warily luke walks toward the stairway
steam begins to build up in the chamber
looking up through the steam luke sees a dark figure standing on a walkway above him
luke holsters his gun and moves up the stairs to face vader
he feels confident eager to engage his enemy
the force is with you young skywalker
but you are not a jedi yet
luke ignites his sword in answer
in an instant vaders own sword is lit
luke lunges but vader repels the blow
again luke attacks and the swords of the two combatants clash in battle
leia lando and chewie with threepio on his back march along guarded by six stormtroopers
the group reaches an intersection where lobot and a dozen of landos guards stand at attention
the guards immediately aim their weapons at the startled stormtroopers
taking the stormtroopers weapons from them lobot hands one to leia and one to lando
hold them in the security tower and keep it quiet
as landos guards quickly march the stormtroopers away lando begins to undo chewies binding
what do you think youre doing
were getting out of here
i knew all along it had to be a mistake
chewie turns on lando and starts to choke him
do you think that after what you did to han were going to trust you
lando tries to free himself from chewie
choking i had no choice
chewie barks ferociously
to chewie what are you doing
trust him trust him
oh so we understand dont we chewie
he had no choice
im just trying to help
we dont need any of your help
choking h a a a
it sounds like han
theres still a chance to save han
i mean at the east platform
chewie finally releases lando who fights to get his breath back
to lando im terribly sorry about all this
after all hes only a wookiee
the two guards slide hans encased body into an opening in the side of the bounty hunters ship
boba fett climb aboard on a ladder next to the cargo hold
put captain solo in the cargo hold
and with that the door slams shut
lando leia and chewie run down a cloud city corridor when suddenly they spot artoo who rushes toward them beeping wildly
where have you been
chewie turns around to see the stubby droid causing threepio to be spun out of sight of his friend
turn around you wooly
to artoo hurry hurry
were trying to save han from the bounty hunter
whistling frantically to threepio artoo scoots along with the racing group
well at least your still in one piece
look what happened to me
an elevator door slides open and lando leia and chewbacca race for a large bay overlooking the east landing platform
just as they arrive boba fetts ship takes off against a cloudy sunset sky
in wild anguish chewie howls and starts firing at the ship
chewie theyre behind you
a laser bolt explodes near the princess
everyone turns to see what threepio has already spotted coming from the other direction a squad of stormtroopers running toward them
artoo peeks out from the elevator
leia and chewbacca start firing at the troopers as lando makes a break for the elevator
laser bolts continue to explode around the princess and the wookiee but they refuse to budge
lando sticks his head out of the elevator and motions for the pair to run but they barely notice
they seem possessed transported as all the frustration of captivity and anger of loss pour through their death dealing weapons
but after a few moments they begin to move through the rain of laser fire toward the elevator
once they are inside the door slams shut and the stormtroopers race forward
luke and vader are locked in combat on the platform overlooking the chamber
their swords clash the platform sways
luke aggressively drives vader back forcing vader to use defensive tactics
you have learned much young one
youll find im full of surprises
vader makes two quick moves hooking lukes sword out of his hand and sending it flying
another lightning move at lukes feet forces the youth to jump back to protect himself
losing his balance luke rolls down the stairs to the circular carbon freezing platform
there he sprawls on the floor surprised and shaken
just in time he looks up to see vader like a giant black bird flying right at him
luke rolls away as vader lands
crouching luke keeps his gaze steadily on his enemy
your destiny lies with me skywalker
obi wan knew this to be true
behind luke the hydraulic elevator cover has opened noiselessly
all the while luke slowly cautiously moves back away from the dark lord
suddenly vader attacks so forcefully that luke loses his balance and falls back into the opening
there is a rumble and in an instant freezing steam rises to obscure vaders vision
vader turns aside and deactivates his sword
all to easy
perhaps you are not as strong as the emperor thought
through the steam behind vader something blurs upward
liquid metal begins to pour into the pit
vader turns around and then looks up
he sees luke who has leaped fifteen feet straight up and who now hangs from some hoses on the carbonite outlet
luke jumps down to the platform where he is separated from vader by the steaming carbonite pit
he raises his hand
his sword which had fallen on another part of the platform swiftly jumps into his outstretched hand and is instantly ignited
vader immediately lights his sword as well
obi wan has taught you well
you have controlled your fear
now release your anger
luke is more cautious controlling his anger
he begins to retreat as vader goads him on
as luke takes a defensive position he realizes he has been foolhardy
a quick sword exchange and luke forces vader back
another exchange and vader retreats
luke presses forward
only your hatred can destroy me
breathing hard luke jumps in the air turning a somersault over vader
he lands on the floor and slashes at vader as the room continues to fill up with steam
vader retreats before lukes skillful sword
vader blocks the sword but looses his balance and falls into the outer rim of pipes
the energy luke has used to stop vader has brought him to the point of collapse
luke moves to the edge and looks down but sees no sign of vader
he then deactivates his sword hooks it on his belt and lowers himself into the pit
moving through a tunnellike entrance luke cautiously approaches the reactor room
he ignites his sword and moves into the room and toward a large window as vader enters
luke raises his sword and moves forward to attack
behind luke a large piece of machinery detaches itself from the wall and comes smashing forward toward his back
luke turns and cuts it in half just as another machine comes hurtling at him
using the force luke manages to deflect it and send it flying as if it had hit an invisible shield
a large pipe detaches and comes flying at luke
he deflects it
sparking wires pull out of the wall and begin to whip at the youth
small tools and equipment come flying at him
bombardment from all sides luke does his best to deflect everything but soon he is bloodied and bruised
finally one machine glances off his and goes flying out the large window
a fierce wind blows into the room unmoving stands the dark rocklike figure of vader
a piece of machinery hits luke and he is knocked out of the window
luke falls onto the gantry rolls and hangs over the edge holding his deactivated sword in hand
he puts the sword on his belt and begins to scramble up
leia lando chewie and the droids come round a corner and head for the door to the landing platform
they glimpse the millennium falcon for a moment before the door slams shut
the group ducks into an alcove as stormtroopers arrive at the end of the corridor
the troopers send a rain of laser bolts at the group
chewie returns their fire as lando punches desperately at the doors control panel
the security codes has been changed
artoo you can tell the computer to override the security system
threepio points to a computer socket on the control panel
artoo beeps and scoots toward it
lando meanwhile has connected up to the panels intercom
this is lando calrissian
the empire has takes control of the city
i advise everyone to leave before more imperial troops arrive
artoo takes off a computer cover and sticks his computer arm into the socket
suddenly a short beep turns into a wild scream
artoos circuits light up his head spins wildly and smoke begins to seep out underneath him
quickly chewie pulls him away
lando leia artoo and chewie flee down the corridor
as he scoots along with them artoo sends some angry beeps threepios way
dont blame me
im an interpreter
im not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal
in a panic cloud city residents are trying to get out of the city
some carry boxes others packages
they run then change direction
some are shooting at stormtroopers others simply try to hide
other stormtroopers pursue lando leia and chewie who are firing back at them
artoo works on another door to the landing platform while threepio berates him for his seeming ineptitude
what are you talking about
were not interested in the hyperdrive on the millennium falcon
just open the door you stupid lump
chewie leia and lando retreat along the corridor
a triumphant beep from artoo and the door snaps open
to artoo i never doubted you for a second
artoo lays a cloud fog obscuring everything as the group dashes outside
they race for the millennium falcon as a battalion of stormtroopers reaches the main door
lando and leia hold off the troops as the droids get on board with chewie
as chewie bounds to the ship the threepio on his back threepio hits his head on the top of the ramp
bend down you thoughtless
chewie starts up the ship
the giant engines begin to whine as lando and leia race up the ramp under a hail of laser fire
artoo drags the partially assembled threepio down the corridor of the falcon
i thought that hairy beast would be the end of me
of course ive looked better
artoo beeps understandingly
chewie works the controls as leia sits in hans seat and lando watches over their shoulders
as chewie pulls back on the throttle the ship begins to move
the millennium falcon lifts gracefully into the twilight sky and roars away from the city
troops fire after it and tie fighters take off in pursuit
luke moves along the railing and up to the control room
vader lunges at him and luke immediately raises his lit sword to meet vaders
sparks fly as they duel vader gradually forcing luke backward toward the gantry
you are beaten
it is useless to resist
dont let yourself be destroyed as obi wan did
luke answers by rolling sideways and thrusting his sword at vader so viciously that he nicks vader on the shoulder
the black armor sparks and smokes and vader seems to be hurt but immediately recovers
luke backs off along the narrow end of the gantry as vader comes at him slashing at the young jedi with his sword
luke makes a quick move around the instrument complex attached to the end of the gantry
vaders sword comes slashing down cutting the complex loose it begins to fall then is caught by the rising wind and blown upward
luke glances at the instrument complex floating away
at that instant vaders sword comes down across lukes right forearm cutting off his hand and sending his sword flying
in great pain luke squeezes his forearm under his left armpit and moves back along the gantry to its extreme end
the wind subsides
luke holds on
there is nowhere else to go
there is no escape
dont make me destroy you
you do not yet realize your importance
you have only begun to discover your power
join me and i will complete your training
with our combined strength we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy
ill never join you
if you only knew the power of the dark side
obi wan never told you what happened to your father
he told me enough
it was you who killed him
i am your father
shocked luke looks at vader in utter disbelief
thats not true
search your feelings
you know it to be true
you can destroy the emperor
he has foreseen this
it is your destiny
join me and together we can rule the galaxy as father and son
come with me
it is the only way
vader puts away his sword and holds his hand out to luke
a calm comes over luke and he makes a decision
in the next instant he steps off the gantry platform into space
the dark lord looks over the platform and sees luke falling far below
the wind begins to blow at vaders cape and the torrent finally forces him back away from the edge
the wind soon fades and the wounded jedi begins to drop fast unable to grab onto anything to break his fall
suddenly luke is sucked into an exhaust pipe in the side of the shaft
when vader sees this he turns and hurries off the platform
luke tumbles through the exhaust pipe
he slides to the end of the slickly polished pipe and stops as his feet hit a circular grill and knock it open
luke claws at the surface of the pipe trying to keep from sliding out into space
unable to hang onto the pipe luke tumbles out emerging at the undermost part of cloud city
reaching out desperately he manages to grab onto on electronic weather vane
luke tries to pull himself up on the weather vane but slips back down
he hooks one of his legs around the fragile instruments
all the while a powerful current of air rushes out at him from the exhaust pipe
there is an ominous cracking sound from the base of the weather vane and a piece breaks off falling into the clouds far below
leia seems to be lost in a fog her expression troubled
chewie is busy operating the ship
lando stands next to the wookiee watching a readout on the control panel
weve got to go back
chewie growls in surprise
i know where luke is
but what about those fighter
chewie barks in agreement with lando
chewie just do it
but what about vader
chewie turns on lando the newcomer with an ominous growl
all right all right all right
the falcon makes a graceful banking turn back toward cloud city
vader enters the landing platform and watches as the speck that is the falcon disappears
the wind blows at his cape
he turns to two aides who are standing near the entrance to the landing platform
bring my shuttle
nearly unconscious luke hangs upside down on the weather vane as his body shifts in the wind
the falcon dives to the underside of the floating city
three tie fighter close in on the starship
leia tries to remain calm
pointing out the cockpit window look someones up there
chewie slow down
slow down and well get under him
lando open the top hatch
lando rushes out of the cockpit
luke hangs by one arm from the crossbar of the weather vane
he slips from the bar and grabs onto the pole of the vane as the falcon banks toward him
the falcon positions itself under luke as lando moves up through the opening of the hatch
luke begins to slide and finally falls from the vane into space
out the cockpit window leia sees luke falling from the bottom of the city
the ship gains on him
the falcon closes in on luke
three tie fighters race toward the falcon firing away
the hatch pops open with a hiss of pressure
lando reaches out to help the battered warrior inside the ship
flak bursts all around it as the falcon banks away from the city
leia and chewie struggle with the controls
into intercom lando
over intercom okay lets go
the falcon races away
it is closely followed by three tie fighters all of which keep up a heavy laser assault on the fleeing starship
explosions erupt all around the cockpit buffeting the ship wildly
chewie howls as he frantically tries to control the ship
leia and chewie turns to see luke bloody and battered enter the cockpit supported by lando
leia jumps up and hugs him while chewie barks in joyous relief
all right chewie
leia helps luke from the cockpit as another huge blast rocks the ship
the falcon still followed by the three tie fighters races away from the cloud covered city
luke rests on a cot his injured arm wrapped in a protective cuff
leia gently wipes his face
the ship lurches again
ill be back
she kisses him then leaves the quarters
all over the ship muted alarm buzzers sound
lando anxiously watches the flashing lights on the control panel and hurriedly adjusts some switches
seated next to him chewie points out a new blip appearing on the panel
leia watching over their shoulders recognizes the shape
all right chewie
ready for light speed
if your people fixed the hyperdrive
another explosion rocks the ship
leia notices as a green light on the panel next to her flashes on
all the coordinates are set
its now or never
chewie barks in agreement
the wookiee shrugs and pulls back on the light speed throttle
the sound of the ion engine changes
it is winding up
faces are tense expectant
but nothing happens and the engine goes off
chewie lets out a frustrated howl
the flak still violently rocks the ship
they told me they fixed it
i trusted them to fix it
its not my fault
chewie gets up from his chair and starts out of the cockpit
he gives lando and angry shove as he storms past him
in the distance the tie fighters continue their chase still shooting lasers
vaders star destroyer moves behind them determinedly following the falcon
vader stands on the bridge looking out the window as admiral piett approaches him
theyll be in range of our tractor beam in moments my lord
did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the millennium falcon
yes my lord
prepare the boarding party and set your weapons for stun
yes my lord
beeping while he works artoo is busy connecting some wires to threepio who now has one leg attached
chewie enters through the doorway grunting to himself
why dont we just go into light speed
artoo beeps in response
how would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated
artoo whistles knowingly
the citys central computer told you
artoo detoo you know better than to trust a strange computer
pay attention to what youre doing
chewie is in the pit
he is trying to loosen something with an enormous wrench
frustrated he uses the wrench like a club and hits the panel
leia and lando seated in front of the control panel are suddenly sprayed by a shower of sparks
vader stands on the bridge watching as the millennium falcon is chased by the tie fighters
as his destroyer draws nearer vaders breathing gets slightly faster
luke realizes that vaders ship is very near
he feels resigned to his fate
he senses that he is beaten more emotionally than physically
son come with me
moaning ben why didnt you tell me
lando and leia are at the controls of the falcon
meanwhile in the ships hold chewie continues to work frantically on the hyperdrive mechanism
into intercom chewie
the falcon races through space followed very closely by the tie fighters and the huge imperial star destroyer
luke enters the cockpit and looks out the window
he is almost unconscious with pain and depression
it is your destiny
ben why didnt you tell me
alert all commands
ready for the tractor beam
artoo races to a control panel and starts working on a circuit board
furious threepio stands on one leg yelling
artoo come back at once
you havent finished with me yet
you dont know how to fix the hyperdrive
chewbacca can do it
im standing here in pieces and youre having delusions of grandeur
artoo moves a circuit on a control panel
suddenly the control panel lights up
leia and lando are thrown into their seats as the millennium falcon unexpectedly shoot into hyperspace
the ship tilts up and artoo topples into the pit on top of chewie
oh you did it
the falcon soars into infinity and away from the huge star destroyer which seems by contrast to stand still
admiral piett and another captain glance at vader in terror
vader turns slowly and walks off the bridge his hands held behind his back in a contemplative gesture
the millennium falcon is attached to a huge rebel cruiser by a docking tube
rebel fighters move about the giant cruiser and a rebel transport ship hovers near the fleet
lando sits in the pilots seat as he talks into the comlink
chewie busily throws a variety of switches in preparation for takeoff
into comlink luke were ready for takeoff
over comlink good luck lando into comlink when we find jabba the hut and that bounty hunter well contact you
luke speaking into the comlink as a medical droid works on his hand
leia stands near him while threepio and artoo look out the window
into comlink ill meet you at the rendezvous point on tatooine
into comlink princess well find han
into comlink chewie ill be waiting for your signal
chewies wail comes over the comlink
into comlink take care you two
may the force be with you
luke looks down at his hand
a metalized type of bandage has been wrapped around his wrist
the medical droid makes some adjustments in a tiny electronic unit then pricks each one of lukes fingers
luke wriggles his fingers makes a fist and relaxes it
his hand is completely functional
he gets up and walks over to leia
there is a new bond between them a new understanding
leia is thinking about han luke is thinking about his uncertain and newly complicated future
together they stand at the large window of the medical center looking out on the rebel star cruiser and a dense luminous galaxy swirling in space
luke puts his arm around leia
the droids stand next to them and threepio moves closer to artoo putting his arm on him
the group watches as the millennium falcon moves into view makes a turn and zooms away into space
while luke leia and the droids stand looking out the window of the star cruiser two escort fighters join the large ship
slowly the cruiser turns and moves away into space
