screenplay by lawrence kasdan story by george lucas the dense lush rain forests of the eastern slopes of the andes the place known as the eyebrow of the jungle
ragged jutting canyon walls are half hidden by the thick mists
the main title is followed by this a narrow trail across the green face of the canyon
a group of men make their way along it
at the head of the party is an american indiana jones
he wears a short leather jacket a flapped holster and a brimmed felt hat with a weird feather stuck in the band
behind him come two spanish peruvians satipo and barranca
bringing up the rear are five yagua indians
they act as porters and are wrangling the two heavily packed llamas
the indians become increasingly nervous
they speak to each other in bursts of quechua
the american who is known to his friends as indy glances back at them
irritated theyre talking about the curse again
he turns and yells at the indians in quechua his anger giving an indication of his own fears
the party reaches a break in the canyon wall and takes the trail through it
when they emerge their destination is revealed to them in the distance
beyond a thick stand of trees is the vegetation enshrouded temple of the chachapoyan warriors
the entire party is struck by the sight
the indians terrified now chatter away
suddenly the three at the back turn and run dropping their packs as they go
barranca yells at the fleeing indians and pulls his pistol out
he starts to raise his arm to aim but indy restrains it in a muscular grip
barranca looks evilly at indys hand upon him
indy releases him and smiles in a friendly way
we dont need them
satipo watches this confrontation with some concern
i do not carry supplies
well leave them
once weve got it well be able to reach the plane by dusk
he turns back to the trail
satipo gets the two remaining indians moving behind indy
satipo and barranca then have a fast silent communication barranca indicates his desire to slit indys throat satipo gives him a look that says be patient you idiot
the party fans out to fight their way through the entwined trees that guard the temple
visibility is cut to five feet in the heavy mist
satipo extracts a short native dart from a tree and examines the point gingerly showing indy the hovitos are near
the poison is still fresh
theyre following us i tell you
if they knew we were here they would have killed us already
the two indiana jabber in quechua near hysteria
barranca is sweating profusely eyes darting
he yells at the indians in quechua to shut up
in the undergrowth there is slithering movement
indian draws aside a branch and is faced with a horrific stone sculpture of a chachapoyan demon
the indian is so frightened no sound comes out when he screams
he turns and runs silently away
indian calls to his friend
getting no response he steps in that direction
a huge macaw flushed from the undergrowth screams and flies away
indian does exactly the same thing never to be seen again
indy satipo and barranca just clearing the trees look back in that direction
they all turn to face the temple
it is dark and awesome
vegetation curls from every crevice over each elaborate frieze
the entrance round open and black has been designed to look like open jaws
so this is where forrestal cashed in
a friend of yours
he was good very good
nervous no one has ever come out of there alive
why should we put our faith in you
indy takes the weird feather from the band of his hat
from around its point he slips a tightly rolled piece of parchment
barranca and satipo exchange a quick so thats where is was
they all kneel as indy spreads out the parchment
on it is one half of a crude floorplan of the temple
no one ever had what we have
indy fixes them with an expectant stare
satipo produces a similar but folded piece of parchment
he lays it the other half of the floorplan next to indys
they all regard it for a moment then indy stands and walks toward the temple
barrancas eyes are shining as they dart between the floorplan and satipo
back turned assuming that pillar there marks the corner and
barranca is suddenly on his feet quietly drawing his pistol
he raises it toward indy as satipo realizes with alarm what hes doing
indys head turns and he sees barranca
indys next move is amazing graceful and fast yet totally unhurried
his right hand slides up under the back of his leather jacket and emerges grasping the handle of a neatly curled bullwhip
with the same fluid move that brings indys body around to face the peruvian the whip uncoils to its full ten foot length and flashes out
the fall of the whip the unplaited strip at the end of the lash wraps itself around barrancas hand and pistol
he could not drop the gun now if he tried
indy gives the whip a short pull and barrancas arm in jerked down where it involuntarily discharges the gun into the dirt
barranca is amazed but feels some slack in the whip and immediately raises the gun toward indy again cocking it with his free hand
indys face goes hard
indy sweeps his arm in a wide arc
barranca spins around enclosed in the whip his gun hand stuck tight against his body
indy gives one more short jerk on the whip handle and barrancas gun fires
barranca falls dead
indy looks quickly at satipo who is shocked and frightened
he raises his arms in supplication
i knew nothing
he was crazy
indy looks him over then nods
he frees the whip from barrancas body and picks up the man
his eyes sweep the surrounding woods
indy and satipo carrying a torch walk up the slightly inclined tubular passage from the main entrance
the interior is wet and dark hanging with plant life and stalactites
their echoing footsteps intermittently overpower the sounds of loud dripping whistling air drafts and scampering claws
indy leads the way down a twisting hallway satipos torch barely lighting his way from behind
indy disappears in a shadow and when he reappears a moment later a huge black tarantula is crawling up the back of his jacket
indy doesnt notice and disappears into another shadow emerging with two more tarantulas on his back
satipo sees them and makes a frightened grunting sound
indy looks at him sees what hes pointing at and casually brushes all three spiders off with his rolled whip as he would a fly
satipo pirouettes for an inspection and indy flicks one off the peruvians back
indy begins picking up little pocket sized artifacts from the niches and ledges of the temple
he continues to do this as the men penetrate the temple
his collecting is quick and expert evaluating the pieces in an instant discarding some stuffing others into his clothes and never stopping his forward progress
the men reach an arch in the hall
the small chamber ahead which interrupts the hall is brightly lit by a shaft of sunlight from high above
indy stops looks it over
are you lost
indy picks up a stick and throws it through the shaft of light
giant spikes spring together from the sides of the chamber with a ferocious clang
and impaled on the spikes are the remains of a white man half fleshed half skeleton in explorer type grab
indy reaches out and takes hold of the mans carcass
as the spikes slowly retract indy pulls it free and seats the remains gently on the floor
gulps we can go no further
now satipo we dont want to be discouraged by every little thing
indy steps sideways into the chamber
his back pressed against the very points of the retracted spikes he moves along the edge of the light beam and steps clear on the other side
satipo grimaces and begins sweating his way through
indy and satipo come down stone stairs to a tight landing
framing the entry are a carefully strung network of dead vines each somehow hooked into the wall narrowing the opening even more
taking torch let me see that
he lowers the torch to the floor of the landing
the landing is carpeted with human skeletons one on top of another all squashed flat as cardboard
indy looks up at the ceiling of the landing then steps onto skeletons which make a cracking noise under his feet
try not to touch the vines
the men are in a high straight hallway feet long
the door at the end is flooded with sunlight
senor i think we are very close
indy stands still looking at the hall
impatient let us hurry
there is nothing to fear here
thats what scares me
they begin walking down the hall side by side
satipo has inched a little ahead
suddenly his lead foot comes down and through the floor
as satipo begins to pitch forward indy grabs him by the belt and pulls him back
they both look down at the floor
indy swings his whip across the floor
fifteen feet of it cuts open beneath the lash falling away to reveal black pit as wide as the hall
the illusory floor was made of dust covered cobwebs
satipo picks up a stone and drops it down the pit
the two men exchange glances
indy looks up at the high roof of the hall
he swings the whip up around a support beam tests its strength with a pull and swings over the pit on the whip
from the other side he swings the whip back to satipo who throws indy the torch
satipo swings across
when they are both standing on solid floor there is a moment of quiet in which they hear from far far below splash
indy wedges the whip handle into the wall and leaves it strung to the beam for quick retreat
a large domed room
ten evenly spaced skylights send their shafts of sunlight down to a unique tiled floor white and black tiles laid out in a lovely intricate pattern
indy and satipo stand at the door and look across the wide room at the altar
there in the supreme hallowed spot is a tiny jeweled figurine indys real objective
two torches many years old are in holders by the door
indy takes one down and lights it
he gives the regular torch to satipo
theres plenty of light amigo
indy kneels and uses the unlit end of the torch to reach out and tap a white tile
it is solid
he taps a black tile
there is a whizzing sound and a tiny dark sticks in the torch
satipo points to the wall nearby there is a recessed hole there
from that hole
indy nods stands and looks around the sanctuary
the entire room is honey comed with the same kind of hole
satipo sees it too and is properly impressed
you wait here
if you insist senor
torch in hand indy begins his careful walk across the sanctuary
stepping only on the white tiles he almost appears to be doing a martial arts kata
before each big move he waves the torch in front of him head to toe looking at the flame
halfway out he sees something on the floor and kneels to look at it
a dead bird lies on one of the white tiles
its body is riddled with little deadly darts
this has great significance to indy and he stands with even greater caution
he waves the torch ahead of him and at waist height an air current whips at the flame
indy ducks under it and leaves a burn mark on the white tile beneath it
satipo watches wide eyed and mystified
indy reaches the altar
the tiny idol looks both fierce and beautiful
it rests on a pedestal of polished stone
indy looks the whole set up over very carefully
from his jacket he takes a small canvas drawstring bad
he begins filling it with dirt from around the case of the altar
when he has created a weight that he thinks approximates the weight of the idol he bounces it a couple times in his palm concentrating
its clear he wants to replace the idol with the bag as smoothly as possible
his hand seems ready to do that once when he stops takes a breath and loosens his shoulder muscles
now he sets himself again
and makes the switch
the idol is now in his hand the bag on the pedestal
for a long moment it sits there then the polished stone beneath the bag drops five inches
this sets off an aural chain reaction of steadily increasing volume as some huge mysterious mechanism rumbles into action deep in the temple
indy spins and starts his kata back across the sanctuary at four times the speed
satipos eyes widen in terror
he turns and runs
the sanctuary has begun to rumble and shake in response to the mysterious mechanism
just as indy goes out the door a rock shakes loose from the wall and rolls onto the tiles floor
immediately a noisy torrent of poison darts fills the room
satipo swings across the pit
he makes it just as the whip comes undone from the beam leaving indy without an escape
satipo extremely nervous regards the whip a moment then turns back to face indy who has run up to the far side of the pit
no time to argue
throw me the idol i throw you the whip
indy hesitates eyeing the rumbling walls
you have no choice
indy concurs with that assessment
he tosses the idol across the pit to satipo
satipo stuffs it in the front pocket of his jacket gives indy a look then drops the whip on the floor and runs
he had a feeling this might happen
he looks around
satipo flies through like a chubby ballet dancer and takes the steps five at a time
indy runs in full stride to the edge of the pit and broad jumps into space
he doesnt make it
his body hits the far side of the pit and he begins to slide out of view
only wild clawing with his fingers at the edge of the pit stops his descent
with just the tips of his fingers over the edge he begins pulling himself up
satipo has slowed down
he begins to edge carefully around the light shaft
indy sails through sideways and rolls to a stop at the bottom of the steps
his whip is grasped in his hand
as he raises himself he hears from above the giant spikes of the chamber of light clang
and an abrupt sickening rendition of satipos last scream
indy runs up the steps
the rumbling sound grows louder
indy slides to a stop
the spikes have retracted taking satipos body to one side
indy edges into the chamber with his back to the shaft of light
soon he is face to face with the dead satipo spikes protrude from several vital spots in the peruvians body
indy removes the idol from satipos pocket and moves quickly out the other side
indy shoots out of a cut off hallway and turns toward the exit
the rumbling is very loud and now we see why right behind indy a huge boulder comes roaring around a corner of the passage perfectly form fitted to the passageway
it obliterates everything before it sending the stalactites shooting ahead like missiles
indy dashes for the light of the exit
his hat flies off his head
almost immediately it is crushed by the boulder
indy dives out the end of the passage as the boulder slams to a perfect fit at the entrance sealing the temple
indy lies on the ground gasping for air
a shadow falls across him and he looks up
looming above him are three figures
two are hovitos warriors in full battle paint and loin cloths
they carry long blow guns
but the man in the center draws indys attention
he is a tall impressive white man dressed in full safari outfit including pith helmet
his name is emile belloq
his face is thin powerful his eyes hypnotic his smile charming yet lethal
his heavily french accented speech is deep mellifluous wonderful
back beyond belloq and his two escorts thirty more hovitos warriors hover at the edge of the trees
jones you choose the wrong friends
this time it will cost you
belloq extends his hand
indy looks at it then produces the idol and hands it to belloq
belloq extends his other hand smiling
indy hands over his gun
belloq sticks it in his jacket
and you thought id given up
eyeing the hovitos too bad they dont know you like i do belloq
smiles yes too bad
you could warn them
if only you spoke hovitos
with that belloq turns dramatically and holds the idol high for all the hovitos to see and says something in hovitos
there is a murmur of recognition and all the indians including belloqs escorts prostrate themselves upon the ground heads down
indy is immediately up and running toward the edge of the clearing
in hovitos kill him
indy disappears into the foliage
an instant later the leaves are peppered with a rain of poison darts and spears
indy runs like hell through steadily falling terrain
and always close behind a swift gang of angry hovitos
occasionally they get close enough to send a dart or spear whizzing past indys head
an amphibian plane sits in the water beneath a green cliff
sitting on the wing is jock the british pilot
indy breaks out of some distant brush and runs along the path at the top of the cliff
yelling get it going
get it going
jock hops in and fires up the planes engines
indy reaches a spot on the cliff above the place glances back them jumps into the river
he comes up swims to the plane and grabs a strut
jock starts the plane moving across the water as indy walks across the wing and falls into the passenger compartment
indy relaxes and lies across the seat a big smile on his face
one hand drops to the floor of the cabin and indy jumps hitting his head
on the floor of the cabin is a huge boa constrictor
indy tries to get his whole body onto the seat
jock sees whats happening
dont mind him
wouldnt hurt a soul
i cant stand snakes
the worlds full of them you know
i hate them
come on now sport show a little of the old backbone
it soars off over the dark jungle
its autumn and the pretty new england campus out indys window reflects it in dazzling color
a few weeks before the start of classes
activity just picking up
some students about
indy is at a bookcase near the window and he looks quite different in this setting
his outfit is tweedy slightly rumpled in the professional style
part of his attention is focused in a book and he wears glasses to see the fine print
the office is cramped absolutely inundated with books maps etchings and archeological artifacts
in fact the only neat spot in the room right now is indys desk which has been cleared off expressly for the benefit of the curator of the national museum
in washington d
brody is examining the small artifacts indy pocketed on his way into the peruvian temple
he occasionally uses a jewelers eyepiece to get a closer look
but he is distracted his concerns elsewhere and it is this that his old friend indy senses from across the room
do you think the idol will ever show up
i dont know
just because belloq had it doesnt mean he kept it
indy snaps the book closed and puts it on the shelf
he takes his glasses off and focuses on brody
at the windowed door to his office two pretty coeds pause for a moment look in at their sexy archeology professor giggle and disappear
getting it away from those indians would be a neat trick a hard look i hope they got him
a young male graduate student indys teaching assistant taps on the door and then pushes his way in with an armload of reference books
indy helps him find a spot for them
i couldnt get the mcnabe professor
someones got it checked out til next month when classes start
thats all right phil
thanks a lot
eager to please will there be anything else
ill see you thursday
the teaching assistant leaves
brody is scowling as he examines the last of the artifacts
hey if you dont like them i can always return them
no theyre beautiful
the museum will buy them as usual
no questions asked
then whats wrong
i brought along some people today
what kind of people
dont worry its not about your business
indicates the artifacts theyre from the army
ive already served
theyre looking for abner
indys course a combination of archeology and anthropology is taught in this amphitheater type lecture hall
his desk and lectern hold large reference books blackboards line the wall
bones maps charts festoon the walls
indy leans against his desk talking with brody and two uniformed army officers colonel musgrove and major eaton who are situated around the first seats in the classroom
but you did study under professor ravenwood at the university of chicago
nods we havent spoken in ten years
im afraid we had a bit of a falling out
you know nothing of his whereabouts
negative just rumors
somewhere in asia last i heard
musgrove and eaton exchange a look theyre disappointed
to musgrove maybe dr
jones can make sense of it
again the military men have a silent communication deciding what to reveal
you must understand dr
jones this is all strictly confidential
yesterday one of our european sections intercepted a nazi communique from cairo to berlin
we dont quite know what to make of it
musgrove takes a sheet from his briefcase
here it is tanis development proceeding
acquire headpiece staff of ra general tengtu hok shanghai
locate abner ravenwood u
brody is excited
he looks at indy
they must have discovered the lost ruins
indy contemplates this big news hes impressed
to himself tanis
aint that somethin
frankly were a little suspicious
an american being mentioned so prominently in a secret nazi cable
ah ravenwoods no nazi
then what do they want him for
theyre looking for the headpiece to the staff of ra
indicates his sheet but it says here thats in china
only half of it
ravenwood had the other half
what would the nazis want with this this staff of ra
i can tell you that
over the last two years the nazis have had teams of archeologists running around the world looking for all kinds of religious artifacts
hitlers a nut on the subject
hes obsessed with the occult
what is this staff of ra anyway
it all has to do with the ark of the covenant
the army guys look mystified the chest the hebrews used to carry around the ten commandments
now its the army men who are impressed
an egyptian pharaoh stole the ark from jerusalem and took it back to the city of tanis
a short time later tanis was consumed by the desert in a sandstorm that lasted a year
but before that the pharaoh had had the ark hidden away in a secret chamber called the well of the souls
which is where the staff of ra comes in
indy moves to the blackboard and makes a quick sketch to give a rough idea of the system as he describes it
and we get a glimpse of what an interesting and enthusiastic teacher he must be
now this was rather clever
the staff was really just a big stick oh i dont know say like this he indicates about six feet no one really knows for sure
any way it was capped by an elaborate headpiece with a carving of the sun at the top
what you had to do was take the staff to a special map room in tanis it had the whole city laid out in miniature on the floor
when you placed the staff in a certain spot in this room at a certain time of day the sun would shine through a hole here in the headpiece and
then send a beam of light down here to the map giving you the location of the well of the souls
where the ark of the covenant was kept
nods which is probably what the nazis are after
whats this ark look like
why its right here
indy pulls a big format book from the stack on his lectern and flips through the pages until he finds a large color print
the other men gather to look
fills the screen
it shows a biblical battle
the israelite army is vanquishing an opposition force
at the forefront of the israelite ranks two men carry the ark of the covenant a beautiful gold chest crowned by two sculptured gold angels
the men do not touch the ark itself rather they carry it by use of two long wooden poles which pass through rings in the corners of the ark
the painting is very dramatic full of smoke tumult and sinewy dying men
but the most astounding thing in the picture is the brilliant jet of white light and flame issuing from the wings of the angels
it pierces deep into the ranks of the retreating enemy wreaking devastation and terror
thats what the hebrews thought
whats that supposed to be coming out of there
the power of god
im beginning to understand hitlers interest in this thing
the bible tells of it leveling mountains and wasting entire regions
moses promised that when the ark was with you your enemies will be scattered and your foes fell before you
pause an army which carries the ark before it is invincible
eaton and musgrove exchange worried looks
oh theres one other thing that hitler undoubtably believes about the ark
a long pregnant pause its said that the lost ark will be recovered at the time of the coming of the true messiah
jones youve been very helpful
i hope we can call on you again if we have questions
brody and indy exchange a look as they all shake and brody starts to leave with the army men
indys english tudor upper middle class home
quite toney well beyond the financial reach of an honest college professor
marcus brody has already rung the bell
indy opens the door
he is dressed in a tuxedo
ive got to talk to you
this isnt really a good time
indy its important
come on in
the lush tone continues here in art deco and shiny marble
indy motions brody toward the study to one side
ill be in a minute
as brody passes the entrance to the expansive living room he spots a beautiful silk gowned harlow type lounging on the sofa in front of a roaring fire
she is sipping champagne
brody enters the book lined dark wooded study
he paces for a moment before the fire which is dying in the fireplace then spots something and goes over to indys big desk
the surface is covered with open books monographs maps and drawings all about the ark of the covenant
brody smiles he knows his friend very well
indy comes in closing the door behind him
brody turns to him with a triumphant expression
they want you to go for it
and theyll pay
smiles good work marcus
i had a feeling this would happen
and of course the museum gets the ark when were done
smiles of course
indys manner is vigorous aggressive
okay heres the way its gonna be
first ill high tail it to shanghai and get the piece from general hok
then i think i know where i can find ravenwood
if only i can get general hoks a tough customer
they dont call him the wild boar for nothing
and hes tied in with the japanese
ill worry about that when the time comes
my only hope is to find the well of the souls before the nazis do
a pan am clipper flies west over the pacific
indy is barely into the front seat of a dilapidated ford as the driver buzz kehoe is peeling out into traffic
in the back seat is a chinese named bang chow
kehoe zigs crazily through traffic with only his left hand as he reaches over to shake with indy
buzz kehoe army intelligence
youve met bang chow
whats the hurry
some german agents got here two hours ago
luckily bang was able to have them detained at customs
well have to hurry
kehoes car emerges from an alley
down the block is tengtu hoks modest walled palace
kehoes car slows a bit and bang steps from the moving car with a small black suitcase in his hand
while he heads down the street toward hoks place kehoes car continues across the street and into an alley on the other side
a mercedes limousine appears round a corner and squeals to a stop at the front gate of the palace which is manned by a sturdy chinese gateman
there are three germans inside one the driver
kehoe alone now pushes a trash container casually into position to hide a newly created hole in the rear wall of hoks museum where several stone blocks have been removed
he looks around and ambles back to the car
the three germans wait impatiently in a magnificent foyer
a chime sounds and huge double doors open to reveal tengtu hok flanked by two uniformed japanese soldiers and a robed chinese advisor
he wears a fantastic gold ornamental robe
despite the majesty however nothing can disguise the fact that hok is basically a wild fat barbarian an animal
hok and his escort group bow in what is the beginning of a long welcoming ceremony
the germans exchange impatient glances but decide they should play it as it comes
no person in sight
instead we see a magnificent display of ancient artifacts
glass cases hold the velvet couched pieces at random spots on the shining marble floor
we hear an odd sound
near the floor on the rear wall of the museum a steel ventilation grate moves
a hand slides it gently across the marble
indy sticks his head out and looks around
the three germans are being served tea and exotic delicacies
a pleased tengtu hok watches from a throne cushion
when the tray of tiny delicacies is presented to him he takes a massive handful crushing them together on their way to his smiling mouth
a huge golden gong seven feet in diameter is suspended from the ceiling by a hook
an enormous hammer hangs poised above it from which emanate myriad tiny threads which run up and across the ceiling then down to the various display cases
indy looks up at the gong then continues his quick quiet foray among the cases
beyond him a high window
hok and his visitors stand to go
the germans pleased expressions make it clear theyre finally on their way to the museum
indy arrives at his destination
the lovely carved gold section of the headpiece is nested on purple velvet in a glass case
at the bottom of the piece is a round hollow where the staff would fit
there is a grunting sound behind indy and he spins already reaching for his revolver
a fierce japanese samurai is running at indy full speed down an aisle of display cases
his sword is raised over his shoulder ready to cut indy in half
hes six feet away when indys gun levels and fires twice blasting him backwards
indy is still looking over his gun when another samurai sword comes down from the side and knocks the pistol brutally out of indys grip his hand avoids amputation by
a quarter of an inch
an amazed indy backs away from the crossing aisle as the second samurai steps in to face him sword raised
indy backs away into an open space and his bullwhip appears in his hand
he gives it one savage crack
to announce its arrival and the samurai slows down eyeing it curiously
the samurai does not look unhappy about this confrontation
how pure it is the sword versus the whip
tengtu hok and the germans have obviously heard something
they are hurrying along the walkway at the side of the building hok in the lead
up ahead is the foot bridge which crosses from the palace to the museum entrance over a moat
the lovely mercedes limousine blows up
the germans spin toward the blast
drawing weapons they run back to investigate
hok follows them confused
indy and the samurai face each other
theyre both breathing hard from previous no contact passes at each other
now indy begins swinging the whip over his head again
it whizzes out toward the samurais face
the samurai takes two lightning quick cuts at the leather but misses
indy swings for the samurais feet the japanese jumps nimbly slashing at the whip
indy does it again
the samurai hops it
the samurai is concentrating on hopping it
indy sees it
the split second he wants
the whip flashes up from the floor and wraps solidly and irrevocably around the samurais neck
indy gives it a murderous pull and the samurai is dead on his feet
hok and the three germans are looking down at the flaming remains of the mercedes
a look of concern crosses hoks face
he turns and runs back toward his beloved museum
indy is at the case containing the headpiece
he smashes the glass with a samurai sword reaches in and grabs the piece
immediately behind him the huge hammer falls and the sound of the gong thunders through the museum
at the sound of the gong the running hok skids to a halt with a crazed expression on his face
he disappears for two seconds in an alcove and emerges holding a big black thompson submachine gun
he runs across the foot bridge and is just barely over it when it blows up
hok safe looks behind him in amazement and then turns to the museum
the double doors at the entrance slam open to reveal hok
indy is halfway along an unprotected wall back to his ventilation entry route
hok opens up on him cutting off his retreat
indy jumps behind a marble column which is promptly blasted with machine gun fire
indy looks above him sees the giant disk of the gong
reaching up pushing with tremendous effort he maneuvers it off the hook
it bounces down to the floor on its side chipping the marble with its monstrous weight
indy steadies it and then puts his whole body into rolling it across the room toward the window
as it starts to roll indy slips behind it and runs across the room with it
hok can see the rolling gong
he opens up on it
the vicious cacophony of machine gun fire is joined by the musical reports of bullets hitting the gong and ricocheting away
very very noisy
behind the gong indy gauges his move
as the gong is about to be stopped by a marble bench indy talks a long stride onto the bench and dives through the glass of the high window
hoks bullets hit the wall
indy lands in a shower of glass on the jutting roof of the museums first floor
he rolls to a crouch and is immediately being fired upon
the germans cut off from the museum are standing on the palace walkway firing at him
indy takes off fast for the rear of the museum
kehoe craning to locate indy has the ford rolling slowly along the back of the museum
bang scouts from the back seat
indy appears on the roof at a run gauges the movement of the car and jumps from the roof of the museum to the roof of the sedan
unfortunately the roof of the old car cant take it and indys legs knife right on through to the interior where he scares the hell out of kehoe
indy squirms his way down into the front seat
are you all right
hes felt better great
kehoe guns it throwing indy back against the cushions
ive got to get to nepal
the plane flies west into the sunset
under a meager seat light indy is pouring over a journal article by abner ravenwood and related map of nepal
a few rows back across the aisle a trenchcoated european spy eyes indy
a huge stuffed raven wings spread wide is mounted behind the long bar in the noisy crowded saloon
a lively mix of patrons is represented in the late hour tableau nepalese natives fierce sherpa mountain guides sleazy international smugglers and fugitives and of course mountain climbers from every
corner of the earth
a tall nepalese mahdlo is the bartender
in a corner near the fireplace trouble breaks out suddenly between the groups at two neighboring tables
ferocious representatives from each table one a wild looking sherpa the other a muscular australian climber jump up to face each other
as the two contenders stand poised for action their respective supporters shift in their places fondling lethal ice axes and clubs
thatll be your last word
the bar has quieted ominously and so we hear with startling clarity when a door behind the bar slams open with a huge bang
and some presence too small to be seen as it moves through the forest of towering patrons makes a beeline for the troubled corner of the bar
a path clears for it
the sherpa and the climber are about to kill each other when the presence arrives directly between them she is marion ravenwood twenty five years old beautiful if a bit
at this moment however that look does not hurt
she is not intimidated by the combatants she jabs accusatory fingers into their chests
she is angry as hell
the patrons shrink under her gaze
that does it
ive been patient with you no goods long enough
im not open at oclock for myself you know
its all for you
and how do you repay me trouble and noise and blood on my floor
i wont have it
do your killing outside
and dont leave any bodies on the porch
the place clears quickly
stragglers and grumblers are given special attention by marion and mahdlo who has come from behind the bar carrying a big axe handle
mahdlo herds the crows out the front door as marion turns and walks behind the bar
a scowl on her lovely face she has just begun clearing the bar of glasses when she notices one remaining patron huddled over a glass at the far end of
grimacing in exasperation she heads that way like a locomotive
hey you deaf one
i said out of my place
i dont mean next easter i mean now she is almost on him when indy looks up smiling
marion stops stares shocked
she hits him with a solid right to the jaw knocking him off the barstool on the floor
he rubs his jaw and smiles up at her
nice to see you too
get up and get out
getting up take it easy
im looking for your father
bitterly well youre two years too late
indys attitude changes instantly
this is sad news
he is silent for a long time
mahdlo comes in the front door and hurries forward when he sees indy with marion
he looks to her for guidance but she stays him with a gesture
go home mahdlo
ill see you tomorrow
mahdlo is hesitant but lays the axe handle on the bar and goes out
indy has been barely aware of him
now he settles again on the barstool
marion has a vindictive look
shell let him stay but she wants to inflict as much pain as possible
he was digging
he spent his whole life digging
dragging me all over this rotten earth
do you find him
hes buried where he was working
probably preserved real good too
in the snow
suddenly the hardness cracks
she is on the verge of tears and does not want him to see them
she turns away and takes a whiskey bottle from the shelf then turns back to pout herself a drink
not a bad way to go
doing what he loved
vitriolic dont give me that stuff
what do you know
she takes a drinks im the one that was left in a bad way
he didnt have a penny
guess how i lived mister jones
i worked here
and i wasnt the bartender
another swallow finally the guy that owned the joint went crazy
they took his away screaming
as they dragged him out he said the place was all mine for life
she looks around the saloon
can you imagine a more evil curse
pause so far its working
why not leave
go back to the states
ill go back
ill get there
not that theres a soul there who knows my name or cares
but ill go
and when i do theyll know me
cause im going to go back in style
a goddamn lady
where you gonna get it
if i knew that you think id still be running this dive
indy looks at her thinking
under his gaze she blushes for reasons only she understands
she looks into her glass and for a moment she softens
ill tell you something indy
ive learned to hate you in the last ten years
but somehow no matter how much i hated you i always knew that someday youd come through that door
i never doubted that
something made is inevitable
hopefully why are you here
indy takes a long time to answer
i need one of the pieces your father collected
marions eyes go icy
she swings at him again with her right but this time he catches her at the wrist
then he stops her left which she has brought up to slap him
you son of a bitch
you know what you did to me to my life
this is your handiwork
i never meant to hurt you
i was a child
you knew what you were doing
i was in love
i guess that depends on your definition
it was wrong
you knew it
indy releases her arms
look i did what i did
i dont expect you to be happy about it
but maybe we can do each other some good
why start now
shut up and listen for a second
i want that piece your father had
ive got money
this stops her
enough to get you back to the states
where are his things
i sold it all
it was all junk
the junk he wasted his life on
giving up thats too bad
indy feels tired defeated
marion is pleased
you look disappointed
i like that
hows it feel
indy has to smile at her glee
nods at his empty glass what are you drinking
refilling his glass real mans drink
me i like scotch
and i like bourbon
and vodka and gin
im not much for brandy
im off that
she pours herself another as indy watches amused
youre a tough broad now arent you
its no act pal
this aint schenectady
i can only say im sorry so many times
marion looks at him thoughtfully takes a drink
you really have money
you dont look rich
indy nods i may be able to locate some of his things
i know whos got them
what do you want
a bronze piece about this size
in the shape of the sun
probably broken off at the bottom
has a little hole in it off center
does that sound familiar
marion thinks nods slowly
do you know where it is
negative thatll get me back but not in style
this doodad must be pretty important
a huge smile lights up marions face
i knew it would happen eventually
i knew it
something had to go my way
pours herself another drink ive got to think this out
im used to bargaining with yaks
okay five thousand
thats all i can give you now
i can get you more when you land in the states
you word huh
indy nods just like you said youd be back last time
that was your word too
im back arent i
marion sneers and they smile together
you can trust me
come back tomorrow
because i said so thats why
its about time i called the shots in this relationship
indy nods gets up to go
wait a minute
leave the five thousand here
indy hesitates you want trust give some
i want to smell your money
indy thinks about this a moment then reaches inside his shirt and pulls cash from a money belt
he lays five grand on the bar
i trust you
youre an idiot
ive heard that
indy starts for the door
marion takes another think
she is getting high
moving back bossy arent you
give me a kiss
indy looks into her eyes then leans over the bar and kisses her deeply
when the kiss ends their faces are very close
marion is flushed
she liked it and would like more
she raises her glass between them to discipline herself
get out of my place
indy smiles and walks to the front door
then without looking back tomorrow
marion stares after him thinking
she takes a drink
then slowly her hand comes up to loosen the scarf that is draped around her throat
it falls away revealing her graceful neck above the dipping top of her blouse
hanging there on a gold chain against her white skin is a sun shaped golden medallion
the bottom looks broken off
marion lifts the medallion so she can see it in her hand then looks thoughtfully after indy
indy sits thinking at the wheel of an old car
finally he puts the car in gear and drives away
across the street the shadow in a doorway comes to life
a dark form steps out to look at indys departing car it is the european spy from the dc
he hurries off in the opposite direction
marion stands before the fire that is shrinking in the fireplace
she jabs at it abstractedly with a poker thinking
suddenly tears well up in her eyes
she lets the poker slip from her hand wipes away the tears
she walks across the room to the end of the bar still cluttered with bottles and glasses and stops at the pile of american money indy has left
she takes the chain from around her neck and lets the medallion slide off it into her hand
she places it on the bar next to the pile of money thinking
then having reached some decision she picks up the pile of bills walks up the back of the bar and pulls a small wooden box from under the bar
she flips open the top puts the cash inside and closes the top
she leaves the box on the bar and starts back toward the medallion
the front door of the saloon bursts open and four bad men come in
marion halfway between the valuable possessions and not wishing to draw attention to either stops where she is
the four bad men who advance on her are
the obvious leader a short vile sadistic german in spectacles by the name of belzig
a trenchcoated second nazi
a ratty looking nepalese and
a mean mongolian
the second nazi and the mongolian both carry submachine guns
good evening fraulein
the bars closed
we are not thirsty
the mongolian and the nepalese poke around checking to make sure theres no one else there
down at the end of the bar the medallion lies partially hidden by surrounding glasses and bottles
the second nazi stops very near it but turns his back to it to face belzig and marion
what do you want
the same thing your friend dr
surely he told you there would be other interested parties
marion shakes her head
ah the man is nefarious
i hope for your sake he has not yet acquired it
why are you willing to offer more
do you still have it
but i know where it is
belzigs smile fades at this news
hes not a patient sort
marion is chilled by the look
she turns and moves to the shelf of bottles behind her reaching high for one very near the large stuffed raven
he hand lingers there a moment and we see from an angle behind the stuffed raven that the left wing spread hides a baretta automatic pistol
marions hand is very near it but withdraws with only a whiskey bottle as the mongolian walks toward her behind the bar
marion opens the bottle before belzig who watches her intently
how bout a drink for you and your men
the second nazi lights up at this suggestion
belzig gives him a withering look
we will stick to the business at hand fraulein
why dont you come back tomorrow when jones is here and well have an auction
belzig gives her a cold look then turns and walks over toward the fireplace
as soon as his back is turned the second nazi grabs the nearest whiskey bottle and takes a quick pull
in so doing he leaves the medallion completely exposed
marion is aware of this as she looks at him
but he quickly puts the bottle down again obscuring the medallion when belzig speaks from the fireplace
im afraid an auction is not possible
pause your fire is dying here fraulein
a beat then threatening why dont you tell us where the piece is right now
listen herr mac i dont know who youre used to dealing with but no one tells me what to do in my place
belzig still looking in the fire sneers and shakes his head
youre all alike
ill show you want im used to
he motions with his hand
the mongolian moves up behind marion and lifts her roughly over the top of the bar knocking over bottles and spilling liquor
he deposits her on the other side where the nepalese and the second nazi flank her and hold her cruelly arms behind her back
marion raises a ruckus
belzig turns from the fireplace
in his hand is the poker its end glowing orange
he advances on marion
marion stops yelling her eyes widen in terror
i can be reasonable that time is passed
the glowing poker point moves inexorably across the room toward marions face
you dont need that
ill tell you everything
yes i know you will
belzig has no intention of stopping now
the glowing tip is approaching marions face
the nepalese watches with savage glee
the tip of the poker is five inches from marions nose when there is a loud crack
and the fall of indys bullwhip wraps around the middle of the poker and tears it out of belzigs hands
the poker sails high across the room free of the whip and lands in the heavy curtains that cover one window
the curtains immediately burst into flame
the four bad men look in surprise toward the front entrance
indy is poised there the whip in his right hand a
automatic raised toward them in his left
now everything begins to happen very fast the mongolian had just come around the bar at the end opposite the medallion
he dives back to crouch behind the end of the bar raising his submachine gun
belzig and the second german dive behind tables near the bar
the nepalese is slower to leave marion he draws a luger
barks and the nepalese dies spinning against the bar
indy fires in the direction of the mongolian
marion swings up over the top of her bar
belzig fires at her but his bullets smash bottles behind the bar and thud into the raven
marion flattens out on the floor behind the bar as bullets hit above her
she reaches up snatches the axe handle from where mahdlo left it and begins crawling down the length of the bar toward the mongolian who sticks his submachine gun out
and fires blindly in indys direction
indy is in a crouch behind a table trying to get a shot at someone
he doesnt notice in the din and confusion when the door bursts open
an incredible fearsome giant sherpa almost seven feet tall soars in and tackles indy from behind
the whip flies from indys hand as he and the giant sherpa roll across the floor upsetting furniture
the mongolian seeing this stands up confidently
marion rises behind him and bashes him over the head with the axe handle
he goes down and out
fire has completely engulfed the curtains and is working across the ceiling on decorative yak skin bunting
a burning fragment drops to the top of the bar which immediately lights up fueled by the spilled alcohol
full whiskey bottles explode like molotov cocktails
rolling on the floor indy and the giant sherpa are fighting for control of indys
belzig sees this and shouts to the second nazi who is rising from cover with submachine gun in hand
shoot them both
hes our man
do as i say
both the giant sherpa and indy hear this
the giant sherpa exchanges an alarmed look with indy and together they swing the
around toward the surprised second nazi
two blasts blow him away
that done indy brings a brass spittoon down on the giant sherpas wrist and the
indy jumps up and kicks the giant sherpa who barely seems to feel it
he grabs indy and flips him effortlessly onto a table
belzig now has a clear shot at indy
he raises his luger
marion at the end of the bar finally gets the hand of the mongolians submachine gun
it roars to life in the general direction of the ceiling
belzig runs for cover as marion gets control of the gun and levels it
belzig dives around the end of the bar opposite marion
when he has set himself he peeks up over the edge of the scorched bar
the alcohol fire has moved down the bar and now much to belzigs surprise he finds himself staring at the fire blackened sun shaped medallion
his eyes widen
he cannot believe his good fortune
without hesitation he picks up the metal medallion palming it
immediately there is a sickening searing sound and belzigs expression changes from joy to agony
he screams in pain and tries to shake the red hot medallion from his skin
marion opens up and the bar starts to splinter in front of belzig
the medallion comes free of belzigs hand and rolls across the floor
belzig has had enough
in excruciating pain he turns sees a window runs and dives through the glass
an exhausted indy uses his whole body to upend the giant sherpa who lands hard on his back
they are surrounded by flames
belzig has his burned hand stuck deep in the snow
now he withdraws it steaming and scurries off into the night like a wounded animal
marion throws down the empty submachine gun and moves through the flames to the center of the bar where she left the box with the five grand
she finds the remains of the box and its contents a shapeless pile of ash and charred wood
at the end of the bar the mongolian has come back to life
he shakes out his head then reaches inside his coat and pulls out a mauser pistol
indy smashes a chair over the head of the giant sherpa and the huge creature goes down
the mongolian points his mauser through the smoke and flame at indy
suddenly the mongolian is shot dead
marion stands beneath her stuffed raven with the baretta
indy moves quickly through the flames his eyes scanning the floor
he picks up his bullwhip and his crumpled felt hat
he peers through the smoke till he spots marion moving among the burning furniture
lets get out of here
not without that piece you want
marion nods kicks aside a burning chair
another burning beam falls from the roof
indy pulls marion close to him protectively
i want you out of here
he begins dragging her out
she breaks away from him darts back and picks the hot medallion up in the loose cloth of her blouse
looking around you burned down my place
figuratively i owe you plenty
literally you owe me plenty
smiles youre something
i am something
and ill tell you exactly what she holds up the medallion possessively
im your partner
first we see the sprawl the soaring minarets the ancient skyline
then were closer in the narrow exotic streets teeming with life fierce looking men in tattered galabiyas black gowned women with veiled faces ragged barefoot children
indy and marion have been welcomed like family into the crowded home of sallah his wife fayah and their nine children ages
fayah a huge imposing woman appears at first glance to be the power in the house
sallah a small cheerful energetic fellow in his forties defers to his wife in all matters of little importance
suddenly the general liveliness at the childrens table escalates into pandemonium attracting the attention of the adults
there is silence why do you forget yourselves
the gaggle of grinning off spring parts to reveal in their midst a monkey
it is munching some flat arab bread
what is this
who brought this animal in
all the children chatter their innocence at once
the monkey chatters too its an entertainer
the monkey jumps from the childrens table to the adults and struts slowly up toward marion who thinks its the cutest thing she ever saw
when it reaches her it takes off its turban and does a deep grand bow to her
she is delighted and takes the monkey into her arms
the monkey kisses her cheek
the children laugh
why thank you
i like you too
then it shall be welcome in our house
you dont have to have it around if you dont want it cheerfully all of allahs creatures are welcome here
you please us by letting us please you
indy and sallah sit in the small protected courtyard
sallah holds the two sections of the headpiece the medallion and the base and has for the first time fitted them together
they fit perfectly and complete the headpiece
he peruses the markings on the headpiece quizzically
indy is cleaning and loading a
i knew the germans would hire you sallah
they couldnt have an excavation in the desert without the best digger in egypt
all arabs look alike to them indy
tell me about the map room at tanis
we found it three days ago
i broke through myself
those nazis are moving awfully fast
the frenchman is helping them
so he got away from the indians
this is going to be more interesting that i thought
im afraid this has put the germans close to finding the well of the souls
indicates the headpiece even belloq wont be able to find it without that
can you make anything of those markings
theyre nothing im familiar with
shakes his head no but i know someone who might
you can go to see him tomorrow
a worried expression indy
something bothers me
what is it my friend
sallah finds it hard to say
when he finally speaks his words are accompanied by a strange eerie foreboding rush of wind through the courtyard
just a coincidence we might suppose
it is the ark
if it is there at tanis
it is not something man was meant to disturb
death has always surrounded it
it is not of this earth
the wind dies down
indy shakes off a chill and stares thoughtfully at his friend
indy and marion are briskly walking along one of cairos busy bazaar streets
vendors with fine cloth pottery baskets jewelry etc line the street
marion has the monkey from sallahs house on her shoulder
do you really need that monkey
im surprised at you indy
talking that way about our baby
hes got your looks too
and your brains
as indy and marion turn a corner the monkey seems to notice something and immediately jumps from marions shoulder and hurries off at a frantic pace down the street
looking disappointed hey
wherere you going
dragging marion on hell be ok
the monkey is seen running around another corner and jumps into the waiting arms of monkey man who appears to be like a beggar with a dirty turban and an
monkey man immediately hurries down the street and passes into a building
in the building are two german agents
monkey man and the monkey both give the heil hitler salute and engage in quick talk
monkey man quickly leaves the two german agents and gets back to the street
he is obviously shadowing indy and marion
indy and marion are just now passing by the monkey man ducks back behind some baskets
indy and marion are passing under a balcony where a lone german agent stands watch
after they pass the agent nods to some bad arabs who are hiding in the shadows of the street
in a moment indy and marion pass by the break
monkey man turns and looks up at a roof further down the alley
he waves with his hand
someone up there waves back
indy and marion have reached a tiny square made even more cramped by its use as a small bazaar
they have started working their way through the crowd when several bad arabs and a german agent begin to converge on them
indy immediately sees whats happening and pulls the bull whip from his jacket
the first bad arab to reach them gets hit in the mouth by the handle of the whip
now all hell breaks loose with bad arabs innocent shoppers baskets of fruit and tables of goods flying every which way in the constricted space
to marion run
get out of here
indy catches a dagger wielding bad arab around the legs with the whip and flips him
marion is reluctant to leave indy
she runs off between two buildings
a bad arab takes off after her
monkey man now standing at the edge of the square points at marion
the monkey jumps off his shoulder and follows marion
marion runs along the narrow space and soon encounters a five foot wall
she flops over it
the bad arab is right on her heels
he reaches the wall and vaults over
on the other side of the wall the bad arab lands in a crouch looks ahead and doesnt see marion
immediately a heavy earthen pot smashes over his head putting him out
marion steps from an alcove and starts to run toward the street at the other end of the walkway
suddenly another bad arab and a new german agent appear in the street at that end
before they can spot her marion retreats to the alcove again
there is a huge rattan basket sitting there
marion climbs in and closes the top above her
the only witness the monkey who is now perched on the fire foot wall
an entire booth of pots and pans collapses on a bad arab and a german agent as indy whips away a support
the chattering monkey leads a german agent and two bad arabs to marions hiding place gesturing maniacally
indy ducks under the swinging blade of a huge arabian sword and kicks the bad arab swordsman in the groin
the german agent leads the way as the two bad arabs carry the huge basket above their heads
the basket top has been fastened closed but marion is making a fuss inside
at the place where the street cuts across the far side of the bazaar marion is able to wedge the top open one inch and screams indy y y y
indy has heard her
he looks across the square as the basket and its escorts disappear beyond a building
one last bad arab rises before him
indys whip flashes and the bad arabs robe falls down to his ankles
indy frantically pushes his way through the panicked mass of humanity in the direction the basket has gone
the bad guys move the basket as fast as they can through streets alleys and passageways thick with people
indy always seems to round a corner just in time to catch a glimpse of the basket before it disappears around a new corner
indy must fight a flow of humanity as powerful as an ocean riptide
finally at the head of one particularly crowded alley indy leaps up onto a wall for a clearer view
whatever he sees gives him an idea and he cuts between two buildings rather than following the basket
two bad arabs come running down the alley with the basket between them
suddenly indys whip flashes out sending both arabs and the basket tumbling
indy steps into view his
trained on the sprawled arabs and looks at the basket
the top has come flying off and the contents have clattered onto the cobblestone inside is not marion but a load of contraband pistols rifles and ammo
indy is advancing on the trembling bad arabs with an ugly look when suddenly he hears marion scream around the corner
indy rounds the corner and is immediately driven back by machine gun fire
taking cover he gets quick intermittent glimpses of this scene at the far corner of the large deserted square is a canvas covered truck
two bad arabs are hurrying toward is with a large rattan basket between them marion screaming inside
a german agent is covering their retreat with a machine gun from the cab of the truck
indy runs up to see the rattan basket being heaved into the back of the truck
what indy cannot see is that the basket lands among an ominous load of german munitions dynamite and firearms
the truck immediately peels out
the german agent has stopped firing in order to drive
he floors it aiming for a street at the corner of the square
indy uses the lull to take careful aim at the german agents profile and fire off three careful shots
the german agent is hit blasted dead against the steering wheel
the speeding truck swerves hits a wall rolls over and explodes in an enormous multi leveled eruption as its contents ignite
several surrounding buildings are leveled
indy blown back across the square looks on astounded and horror stricken
a dark smoke filled den on iniquity
the patrons almost all fearsome arabs sit in small shadowy groups around the room
indy stands at the bar finishing off a fifth of bourbon
he is drunk
the arab bartender places a new bottle of expensive bourbon in front of him
indy eyes is queerly
the gentleman in the corner sent it
he would like you to join him
doesnt even look too bad
im drinking alone
the arab bartender does a take looking at the three tough german henchmen who have surrounded indy from out of the smoke their hands stuffed in bulging trenchcoat pockets
indy notices them now with a bleary glance
he decides hes in no shape to kill or be killed and moves with them across the room taking his bottle with him
the arab patrons take this in and mind their own business
the occupant of the smoke shrouded corner table becomes visible only as indy reaches there it is emile belloq
he is drinking wine
good evening dr
i ought to kill you right now
it was not i who brought the girl into this dirty business
indy knows its true thats whats tearing him up
sit down please before you fall down
we can behave as civilized people
im afraid it will be your last opportunity
indy sits glancing at the german henchmen who settle nearby just out of earshot
not a very private place for a murder
looking around these arabs will not interfere in the white mans business
they do not care if we kill each other off
takes a sip of wine refers to it terribly difficult finding a decent vintage here
you were quite vigorous in shanghai
unfortunately our friend the wild boar had taken the precaution of making several copies of the piece
indy registers this as he takes a drink
belloq watches him with disdainful amusement
how odd that is should end this way for us after so many
i almost regret it
where shall i find a new adversary so close to my own level
try the local sewer
i know you despise me
we always hate in others that which we most fear in ourselves
and you and i are very much alike
now youre getting nasty
we have always done the same kind of work
our methods have not differed as much as you pretend
i am a shadowy reflection of you
but it would have taken only a nudge to make you the same as me to push you out of the light
theres a certain amount of truth to this the recognition of it flickers across indys bleary eyes
belloq sees it there
you know it to be true
and how ironic the timing
belloq leans forward eyes shining voice suddenly different
do you realize what the ark is
very intense its a transmitter
a radio for talking to god
and now it is within my grasp
what about your boss der fuhrer
i thought he was waiting to take possession
belloq glances into the gloom at the german henchmen
quieter when the time is right
when i am finished with it
i hope your friends are patient
dangerous work belloq
you may consider yourself fortunate that your involvement concludes here
tell me did you get away with the idol
negative i was lucky to get away with my life
the hovitos proved quite narrow minded about the whole matter
indy takes a drink
you know if its god you want to talk to maybe i can arrange it
smiles you have not changed
but please do not reach for your weapon until you are ready to die
the front door of the bar slams open and all nine of sallahs children scamper in and over to a surprised indy
two of the smallest hop into his lap
uncle indy we have been looking for you
come home now uncle
suddenly the arab patrons of the bar take an intense interest in the situation shifting their weapons
yes ill come now
indy stands up
the german henchmen and poised
belloq eyes the arab patrons and signals for the henchmen to relax
next time indiana jones it will take more than children to save you
the children usher indy out
indy climbs into the cab of sallahs truck with a smiling sallah as the children pile into the back
sallah pulls out
i thought we would find you there
indicating the kids better than the united states marines eh
nods thanks you
grave marions dead
yes i know
i am sorry
pause more reason than ever to beat the bastards
he touches indy life goes on indy
indicates the kids again there is the proof
indy looks back there nods
i have much to tell you indy
fayah brings in a tray of food and puts it on the table
the bowl of dates is in one corner
as fayah leaves the room the monkey slips out of sallahs lap and disappears under the table
indy leans over the food tray his hand hovering over the dates
but he chooses some cheese and bread instead
and they made the calculation in the map room
nods vigorously this morning
belloq and the boss german shliemann
when they came out of the map room we were given a new spot in which to dig
out away from the camp
resigned the well of the souls
sallah nods moves to the food
he picks up a date then changes his mind and drops it taking a bunch of grapes instead
indy picks up a chicken leg in one hand and a date in the other his mind distracted
fayah enters the room just in time to see indy flip the date high into the air and try to catch it in his mouth
it bounces off his chin and falls to the floor
indy looks sheepishly at fayah
fayah picks up the fallen date and puts it in the dirty ash tray she is now removing
amir speaks in a slow raspy voice without looking up
the two men go and huddle over the old man
the monkey peeks up over the edge of the table at the array of food
he picks up a date and disappears below the table
amir points to some markings on the lower part of the headpiece
this is a warning
not to disturb the ark of the covenant
just want i need
the monkeys paw comes up over the edge of the table and grabs another date
how bout the height of the staff
did belloq get it off of there
it is here
indy nervous goes back to the food tray picks up another date
when he turns back to the men the monkeys paw grabs another date
we see the headpiece in closeup on the table
amirs crooked fingers trace a line of markings along the bottom section to the break in the piece
it says it is
ten jamirs high
about seventy five inches
i am not finished
amirs finger moves across the break as the markings continue on the sun medallion
reading and one jamir to honor the hebrew god whose ark this is
indy still holding the date exchanges a long look with sallah
you said their top section was blank
are you absolutely sure
belloqs staff is seven and a half inches short
theyre digging in the wrong spot
sallah and indy begin to laugh
amir gives them a glance and returns to his wine
sallah leans over and kisses the old man
to amir a home run my friend grand slam
to indy we have a saying a little luck is better than much smartness
indy pardner you are very lucky fellow
then he takes the data in his hand and flips it high in the air
he opens his mouth to catch it but it doesnt come down
he has inadvertently thrown it into a bowl of a hanging lamp
this makes the men laugh even harder
indy goes over and picks up another date
he turns laughing to sallah and doesnt see as the monkeys paw comes up slowly takes another date and begins to withdraw
suddenly the paw is stricken with palsy and the unseen monkey goes into its death throws
sallah watches the paw as though hypnotized
finally the paw slips from sight and we hear a solid thump
on the floor
sallah walks around the table and looks at the floor
the monkey lies dead among a mess of date pits
indy is in a happy world of his own
he throws his date high in the air
he positions himself under it and waits for it to drop in
here it comes
right on target
as its about to disappear into indys mouth sallahs hand flashes in and grabs it
indy looks mystified and disappointed
sallah motions toward the dead monkey
two old trucks come down a narrow mountain road and onto the flat surface of the desert
further out into the desert the one in the lead sallahs truck stops and the second one omars truck pulls up beside it
there are half dozen arab diggers in omars truck
indy dressed as an arab gets out of the cab of sallahs truck and moves over to confer with omar another old friend
they point off into the desert and reach some conclusion
indy gives him a pat on the back omar turns off the road and drives into the desert with his workers
indy hops back in the cab of sallahs truck with sallah
as they move down the road we see that the back of the truck holds three other arab diggers
indy and sallah are lying in classic shouting fashion at the top of the rise looking down on the tanis digs
down behind them sallahs truck is parked with the three arab diggers
they arent kidding
the tanis digs are laid out below like a painting
trucks bulldozers arab workers and german supervisors are everywhere
the excavations themselves are extensive and somewhat random holes have been dug and then abandoned foundations and passageways unearthed and then deserted
beyond the main digs a crude airstrip has been created
sallah points to what appears to be a mound of dirt with a hole in it near the center of the activity
that is the map room
what time does the sun hit the map
just after eight
we havent got much time
where are the germans digging for the well of the souls
sallah points out into the desert a short way beyond the main area of activity
the desert turns to sand dunes out there the surface undulating into the distance
several trucks and men are out there and a bulldozer is lumbering noisily toward it
sallahs truck drives through the camp one of the arab diggers at the wheel
indy and sallah are in the back and look just like the other two arab diggers
sallahs truck does behind a tent and when it appears on the other side indy and sallah are gone
indy and sallah move stealthily among the tents
indy carries a smooth wooden staff almost seven feet tall
they stop between two tents and look across a path at the entrance to the map room
what appeared to be a mound of dirt is actually the roof on the ancient building
the hole entrance is a five foot square skylight
indy looks around then walks casually to the edge of the hole and looks inside
sallah joins him producing a length of rope from his robes
indy drops the staff into the unseen map room as sallah ties the rope around on oil drum
when its secure indy wastes no time disappearing down it into the map room
indy is down the twenty feet to the floor of the room in seconds
he tugs on the rope and it immediately gets pulled up
indy looks around with real wonder and excitement
the room is lovely with elaborate wall carvings and frescoes all lit by the bright stream of sunlight flooding in from above
this beam of light leads indys eye to the far end and the rooms truly remarkable feature built into the floor in meticulous relief is a miniature stone model of
the ancient city of tanis
already the sunlight has worked its way down the far wall and is edging onto the miniature of the city
on the floor to the skylight side of the miniature is an elaborate line created by embedded mosaic tiles
the evenly spaced slots in the line each accompanied by a symbol of a time of year are for the base of the staff
indy pulls the headpiece from his robes it has been welded together and reaches for the staff
an extremely nervous sallah has the gathered rope in his hands and is trying to appear casual as he inches back toward the oil drum
there is now a good bit of activity going on up here
you the skinny one
sallah jumps about three feet
the jeep german is standing in an open space ten yards away looking at sallah
what are you doing there
sallah gestures his innocence
well bring that rope over here you cur
the jeep german starts back toward his major concern his jeep is stuck in some sand beyond the next tent
some arab workers are trying in vain to budge it
now another german has backed his truck up to it
sallah can think of nothing to do expect obey
with a worried glance at the map room be begins untying the rope from the oil drum
indy is examining the results of belloqs work
red paint marks one of the miniature buildings in the layout and a white calibrated tape has been strung from that building back to a miniature of the map room
now indy begins examining the mosaic base line for the staff
sunlight has moves further down across the miniature
sallah watches nervously as his precious rope is pulled taut between the pulling truck and the stuck jeep
he doesnt notice that he has chosen to stand next to a large steaming kettle of food until bring us some of that
he points to the kettle
sallah looks frantically from the rope back to the skylight of the map room to the kettle of food
sallah picks up some serving pieces and gets to work
the moment has arrived
even the tension of the circumstances cannot distract indy from the purity of what he is about to do
all his calculations are adjustments complete indy takes the staff of ra and places it clink
in the right depression on the base line
this is as active and exciting a moment as any archeologist can dream of and at heart that is exactly what indy is
the sunlight catches the very top of the headpiece and moves within a fraction of an inch of the tiny hole in its sun
the edge of the sunlight moving across the miniature city is still a good two feet beyond the spot belloq has settled on
and now that line of light is broken by the shadow of an ornate sun at the top of the staff
indys face reflects his concentration
and then his immense pleasure
he sees what he came for
out of the miniature city one small building is being lit by a tiny beam of sunlight in the center of the shadow of the metal sun
and by some trick of ancient artistry this one building responds to the sunlight like none of the others
the golden light permeates it it seems to glow
the building is in a direct line with belloqs all the frenchmans other calculations were right but it is a foot and a half beyond it
sallah sweating profusely has finished serving the line of breakfasting germans and now heads back to replace the kettle and get away
bring us water
indy is on his knees at the miniature city a special tape measure in his hand
indy has the tape strung from belloqs mistaken spot to his own correct spot
he gets his reading leaps up and crosses to the erect staff
he pulls the headpiece off the staff and hides it in his robes
he quickly breaks the wooden staff in two and throws the pieces behind a pile of debris
then he moves quickly to beneath the skylight
stage whisper sallah
he waits then louder sallah
indy looks around for some alternative means of escape
the room doesnt offer any
he looks up at the skylight again
a long pause
then something comes down
a makeshift rope
really just a bunch of clothing tied together tunics robes pants
but what we see first and most prominently the first section of indys escape rope is a bright nazi flag
indy beams and climbs
indy sticks his head out the skylight sees it clear and flops his body out
sallah crouching behind the oil drum immediately starts pulling in the makeshift rope
sallah stuffs the rope in the oil drum and the two men begin waking toward some tents
more water over here
sallah glances at indy then hurries back in that direction
the hungry german focuses on indy
why arent you at the digs
indy bows in wild subservience and hurries off in the opposite direction
yelling after him irritated no dummkopf i said come
indy hustles between the tents
up ahead two german officers stop to talk blocking his exit
he moves along the side of one of the tents until he finds an opening and slips inside
indy finds himself in a tent set up for rather comfortable living
he has just started to cross it when he hears a loud excited grunting
he turns toward the sound
in the corner tied to a chair and gagged is marion
indy rushes to her snatches the gag from her mouth and embraces her
they kiss deep and long
i though you were dead
they were throwing me around like a rag doll
they must have switched baskets
thank god for that
bless those bastards
have they hurt you
not since i got here
they just asked about you what you knew
the frenchmans got the hots for me
ive been playing that along
oh indy get me out of here
indy pulls out a knife and then stops suddenly thinking
putting the knife away i have to leave you here for a little while
i know where the ark is
if i take you out of here theyll start combing the place for us
louder cut me loose
keep your voice down
screaming i said get me out of indy pops the gag back in her mouth
her eyes widen in fury and she grunts obscenities at him
look you dont know how glad i am to see you
and i dont like doing this
but the whole thing will be shot if you dont just sit here quietly
they havent hurt you in the last twenty four hours they arent going to start now
ill be back to get you in no time
he kisses her forehead jumps up and hurries out of the tent
with the digs behind them indy and sallah run up to the ridge of the dune and over the top
at the bottom of the far side omars truck is parked
omar and his men are waiting
this new spot gives indy a higher better view of the whole scene
indy is using a surveyors instrument to take a reading looking through the instrument indy gets a line from the map room through the site where the nazis are digging
in the dunes to a spot several dunes over
we focus on that virgin spot of well hidden sand as there
omars truck is parked at the spot just viewed from afar
dunes rise on either side
one of omars men has been posted as a lookout up on a ridge
everybody else indy sallah omar and his men have begun digging for the wells of the souls
they continue to dig furiously all of them drenched in sweat
the hole has grown but this is slow back breaking work
belloq shliemann the ranking nazi and shliemanns aide gobler come into the tent which is full of charts and maps drawings of the ark radio equipment liquor and food
the men have been out digging for the well all day
they are tired discouraged testy
in all matters gobler shows his alliance with shliemann against belloq with small looks and body language
the frenchman has disappointed them and he is feeling the isolation of a scapegoat
belloq gets himself a drink as shliemann towels off his face
i cautioned you about being premature with that communique to berlin
archeology is not an exact science
if does not adhere to time schedules
the fuhrer is not a patient man
he demands constant reports and he expects progress
you led me to believe nothing
i have made no promises
i said only that it looked very favorable
perhaps the ark will still be found in an adjoining chamber
based on the information in our possession my calculations were correct
perhaps some bit of evidence still eludes us
perhaps perhaps the girl can help us
belloq shoots him an angry look
my feeling exactly
she was in possession of the original piece for years
she may know much
really evil if properly motivated
i tell you she knows nothing useful
im surprised to find you squeamish
that is not your reputation
but it neednt concern you
i have the perfect man for this kind of work
shliemann signals gobler who steps outside the tent a moment calls someone and then reappears
belloq looks warily at the entrance
after a moment belzig enters reeking villainy
when his eyes find shliemann his superior he snaps a crisp heil hitler
at him holding his palm rigid a long time exposing a burned scar in the prefect shape of the sun medallion
in the eerie conjunction of moonlight and torchlight indy and the other men step back in awe of their discovery there flush with the bottom of their pit is a
heavy stone entry door to an underground chamber
special prying tools are produced
with two men assigned to each of the two long tools they work in unison to open the vault
they open it a foot and the other men rush in to flop the heavy door completely open
down inside only blackness
the men quickly prostrate themselves around the edge of the entry to look inside
indy and sallah each take a torch and hold them down the hole
the well of the souls is a spooky chamber thirty feet deep
the walls are covered with hieroglyphics and carvings
the roof is supported intermittently by stone pillars the closest of which hits the roof very near the entry hole
the well is quite large as indy and sallah wave their torches more and more of the room is revealed
now the far end of the chamber comes into view
there is a stone altar down there and on this elaborated carved platform is a stone chest big enough to enclose the lost ark and protect it from the ravages
this altar appears to be the only place on the floor of the well that is not covered by a strange dark carpet of some kind
the ark must be in that stone case
whats that gray stuff all over the floor he breaks off realizing exactly what that carpet is
indiana jones blanches
indy drops his torch to the floor of the well
this is answered by the most horrific hissing imaginable
that think dark carpet is moving
its thousands and thousands of deadly poisonous snakes egyptian asps
and the only thing that seems capable of avoiding this venomous groundcover is the altar
the snakes ebb and flow near it but never encroach on it as though repelled by some invisible force
indy shakes his head and talks to himself
why did it have to be snakes
after a moment of this he stops
he gathers his energy and resolve and gets back to the task
where indys torch had landed is a circle of snake free floor
the snakes hate the flame they stay away
lots of torches
i want a landing strip down there
fifteen torches have been dropped to the floor of the chamber combining to make a good sized clear zone
smoke begins to fill the room
several canisters of oil have been lowered into this space
now a large wooden crate is lowered slowly by rope
rope handles are attached to each end of the crate
up at the hole indy gives sallah a reassuring pat takes a breath and swings carefully onto a rope hanging from the hole
despite his care he swings a bit and his feet hit the stone pillar which is so near the entry
surprisingly the pillar actually moves a bit showering a light rain of crumbled stone to the floor below
indy lands on the floor of the well
he looks at the altar over a sea of undulating death
he picks up an oil canister and splashes two parallel lines of oil and lights them
a path six feet wide begins to open to the altar
behind indy sallah comes quickly down the rope
we begin to intercut all the action in the well from here on with insert shots of the snakes outside the flames
snakes and snakes
we see snakes piled and entwined six inches deep mother snakes laying snake eggs snake eggs hatching little snakes snakes cannibalizing other snakes
belloq has been talking to the still bound marion
he has removed her gag
he is impatient angry uncomfortable
caught between two forces
believe me you made a mistake
if you would just give me something to placate them
some bit of information
i swear to you i know nothing more
i have no loyalty to jones
hes brought me only trouble
he wants to believe her
i cannot control them
marions frightened look shifts suddenly to the entrance of the tent
there are new arrivals there shliemann gobler and belzig
belzig carries a black leather case
he steps forward and smiles at marion
we meet again fraulein
the sky is just beginning to lighten over the dunes to the east making dangerously obvious the thin column of smoke rising from the entrance to the well
omar and his men are peering through the smoke down into the well
indy and sallah are on the altar
pushing together with all their strength the heavy stone top of the protective chest begins to slide away
indy and sallah exchange slightly wary but very excited looks then continue to push
as the ark begins to be exposed the air seems to almost vibrate to become electrostatically charged
we hear what sounds like a low hum
the sea of snakes around the altar draws back further from this presence
as the top of the stone chest is pushed completely off and slams down beside it we see the lost ark of the covenant
it is awesomely beautiful breathtaking
feet wide and
its height however is increased by the two sculptured gold angels mounted facing each other on the top
though the body of the ark is acacia wood it has been overlaid with gold
an elaborate gold crown surrounds the top edge and gold carrying rings are attached to each corner
sallah is mesmerized by the sight
his hand starts to reach out and touch one of the angels but indy grabs it
dont touch it
never touch it
the wooden crate stands open next to the stone chest
now indy extracts the wooden poles from its rings and begins fitting them through the rings in the ark
this takes some maneuvering by the two men but soon they are able to lift the ark clear of the stone chest and into the wooden crate
they extract the poles fasten the top of the crate and stick the poles through the rings of the wooden crate
they start back toward the space under the hole
the fire strips have begun to dwindle as have some of the torches
the snakes move slowly in toward the clear spaces
indy and sallah eye them nervously as they hurry along with their heavy load
under the hole they hurriedly attach ropes to the wooden crate and it is pulled up
indys concentration is on the tide of snakes
why did it have to be snakes
sallah takes the next rope and climbs quickly out of the well
indy has picked up a torch and now throws it at a pool of snakes who are too close for his comfort
he turns and takes hold of the exit rope
he gives it a first tug and it falls down into the well landing partly beyond the ring of fire where is instantly disappears in a tangle of angry hissing
indy looks up at the hole
what the smiling down at him from the perimeter of the entry are belloq shliemann and gobler
jones whatever are you doing in such a nasty place
belloq and the germans laugh
why dont you fellows come down here
ill show you
no thank you my friend
he glances around him i think we are all very comfortable up here
sunlight is flooding this tableau sallah omar and his men are being held at bay by ten armed nazis
the wooden crate sits safely nearby
belzig and another nazi have the gagged marion held in their rough grasp
down to indy after all these years it is most considerate of you to aid me in this way
as belloq speaks shliemann exchanges a look with belzig
belzig smiles and takes the gag from marions mouth
shliemann smiles down at indy
im afraid we must be going now dr
our prize is awaited in berlin
but i do not wish to leave you down in that awful place
he give a sign all alone
belzig and the nazi move marion to the hole and to belloqs surprise push her in
marion falls thirty feet screaming
indy drops his torch braces and catches her
her weight knocks him to the ground almost into the snakes
she looks around at the snakes clinging to him more desperately as he struggles to his feet trying to unload her
dont put me down
up at the hole theres plenty of dissension
the girl was mine
she is of no use to us
only our mission for the fuhrer matters
shliemann glances meaningfully around at the other nazis
i wonder sometimes monsieur if you have that clearly in mind
belloq feels how much he is the outsider his own vulnerability
he backs down with the wisdom of survival
he turns to look down at indy and marion
his manner is gallant
a pause then with respect indiana jones
belloq and the others step back from the hole and unseen nazis slam the heavy stone door into place
her scream is accompanied by a huge whoosh
as air is sucked out and the chamber is sealed
half of the torches still burning go out with the sound
the remaining torches continue to extinguish at punctuating intervals throughout the following action and the snakes immediately flood into the newly darkened spaces
indy puts marion down and snatches up two burning torches
he hands one to marion
theres plenty of time for that later
wave that at anything that slithers
indy holds his torch out like a lantern and begins a slow o turn his eyes peering into the gloom examining every inch of wall and ceiling
what are you doing
just watch the floor
reminded of the encroaching snakes marion waves her torch at the nearest edge of their circle
she looks faint
indy continues his slow turn
whatever youre doing do it faster
he spots something there
his head whips around looking at the pillars around the room
he sees what he wants
he grabs one of the oil canisters looks back to the spot on the wall hes chosen and splashes oil on the floor in that direction then lights it
a path opens toward that wall
marion is frozen in her spot
indy drags her after him
he splashes oil the rest of the way to the wall
it lights and indy pulls marion over to the wall
he pours the remaining oil in a circle around them creating a safe zone there
grabbing him where are you going
ill be back in a minute
were going through this wall
marion looks at the wall which looks like all the rest to her
she thinks hes crazy
just keep your eyes open and get ready to run
no matter what happens to me
panicked what do you mean
indy runs back through the path of flames to the center of the room
snakes strike as his flying heels
indy reaches the base of the pillar which he touched briefly on his original descent
he uses his torch to clear away the scattered snakes climbing on it then pulls out his whip
he draws it back then wraps is solidly around the pillar feet up
with the torch in his mouth he begins climbing the pillar
it moves ominously under his weight
the last two torches still burning on the floor go out
now the only light in the chamber is provided by the torches held by indy and marion and the dwindling oil flames
snakes move in and surround the base of indys pillar
the path between marion and the center of the room is overrun
the circle of flame around marion is dying down
she looks beyond it with terror widened eyes then up through the increasing smoke at the distant indy
near the top of the pillar indys hands strain along his taut whip which he has moves higher
a snake slithers into view there inches from indys straining face
indy turns his head so the torch in his mouth can burn it
the snake falls from the pillar
indys torch is dwindling
indy works his body around so that he is on the side of the pillar away from marion
the pillar moves showering dust
indy looks at the chamber wall five feet away takes a breath and swings his legs up against it
he is now braced between pillar and wall
screaming where are you
snakes are moving in force up the pillar toward indys dwindling torch
indy grasps the pillar for dear life grimaces with exertion and pushes against the wall with all hes got
the pillar begins to break loose of the ceiling then stops
indys eyes are on the torch
it is just a spot of flame now
snakes are sliding up toward his hands
indy again pushes against the wall and the torch falls out of his mouth
the pillar goes
in the dim light we see it fall like a tree directly at marion
indy rides it down
the top hits the wall three feet from a cringing marion and smashes through to a black chamber beyond
indy flies off into the darkness
marion clutches her torch at the black hole
where are you
there is a moment that seems an eternity then indy appears like an apparition out of the void
he grabs her and helps her over the remains of the wall into the winding string of connected chambers is revealed to them only a few feet at a time
as their torch lights the way
are they here
i guess not
i think id be dead
do you know where youre going
they round a corner and flush a covey of bats
dont do that
it scares me
marion gives him a look
they round a corner and begin a walk through a maze of chambers that present for their inspection moldering mummies and stacked sarcophagi a room decorated with a thousand human
skulls a wall crawling with huge scarabaeid beetles
marion is quite naturally a nervous wreck she jumps when indy grabs her suddenly and points
there coming through the crack in the corner of the next chamber is white blessed sunlight
indy and marion peek out into the light from the shadows of an abandoned excavation
before them is the improvised airstrip serving the digs a crude runway a tent supply depot two fuel tank trucks
down by the fuel trucks a german mechanic is looking skyward
now indy and marion look there too drawn by the roaring sound of a flying wing which is circling over the digs in preparation to landing
now a new figure approaches the german mechanic
it is gobler he yells to the mechanic indicating the plane
get is gassed immediately
it has an important cargo to take out
in the distance the flying wing lands and rolls toward the men
gobler spins and heads back toward the main camp which is hidden from view by a rise
indy and marion watch him go
when the ark gets loaded were already going to be on that plane
the flying wing rolls up into the space near the fuel trucks
the german mechanic puts blue blocks in front of the tires as the engines continue to roar
indy and marion run in a crouch to a hiding spot closer to the plane near the supply tent
suddenly a second german mechanic appears behind them
he is as surprised as they are but recovers quickly and swings a big monkey wrench at indy
indy grabs the swinging arm and the two men tumble out into the open wrestling
marion remains hidden moving fast among the crates
the first german mechanic who is just pulling the fuel hose from the tank truck to the plane sees the combatants and runs to help his countryman
he is almost upon them when indy puts the second german away with a devastating left right left combination
he turns to find the first german mechanic flying at him
the roll toward the rear of the flying wing and its lethally spinning reversed propellers
in the cockpit of the flying wing the pilot has been fiddling with his gauges just prior to shutting off his engines
now he notices the fight going on outside
the fistfight between indy and the german mechanic has taken on a new stomach tightening dimension
the men are fighting and flailing in and out between the spinning props at the back of the planes wings
each man comes within inches of becoming instant mincemeat
the pilot slides away the top of his cockpit and stands up
he pulls a luger from his side and points it waiting for a clear shot at indy
the german mechanic kicks indy away from him and the pilot aims his pistol
suddenly marion appears behind the pilot standing on the opposite wing and bashes him over the head with one of the blue blocks that was holding the tires
the pilot drops down into the cockpit his body falling on the throttle
the engines roar louder revving up
the plane begins to roll rotating around its one still blocked set of tires
marion grabs onto the cockpit to keep from slipping into the props
she bends into the cockpit trying to pull the pilots body off the throttle
she grimaces and climbs inside
her shoulder bumps the top of the cockpit it slides tightly shut above her
under the moving wing indy delivers a knockout rightcross to the german mechanic which sends him staggering back toward a roaring propeller
indys grimace registers the mans demise and a fine mist of blood wafts toward him
indy spins toward the sound of crumpling metal and sees the other prop of the flying wing slice into a tank truck
the airplane fuel inside floods out onto the pavement surrounding the plane
indy backpedals away from the plane his eyes searching the scene for marion
suddenly he is shocked to see her in the cockpit
he runs toward her skidding through the gasoline
marion is struggling with the top of the cockpit
she cant budge it
three armed nazis stand guard around the wooden crate containing the ark
it is sitting near the flopped open entrance to the command tent and there is furious activity going on here
belloq shliemann gobler belzig and assorted aides are packing up all the papers and personal items in preparation for a hasty departure
a large crowd of arab diggers is milling about among the tents
they all want to get a look at the ark
sallah is among them
all at once there is a earthshaking explosion
al eyes turn toward the rise that hides the airstrip
a huge fireball floats into view over there
everyone starts running toward it
shliemann yells at belzig and the armed nazis
stay with the ark
almost all the arabs and germans in the digs have congregated here and are staring at the burning remains of the flying wing
belloq and shliemann arrive just as the second fuel truck blows up
the concussion knocks many of the observers flat
belloq shliemann and gobler watch the scene in alarm
we must get the ark away from this place immediately
to gobler have it put on the truck
well fly out of cairo
gobler snaps his heels turns to go
and gobler gobler stops i want plenty of protection
gobler nods and runs off
shliemann heads back toward camp
belloq hesitates a long moment studying the burning wreckage with an odd suspicious look
finally he turns and leaves passing a nearby stack of barrels
when he has passed sallah appears from among the barrels
he searches the crowd for his people and starts a broken field run along some tents to avoid a group of germans and is running flat out when someone sticks
out a leg and sends him flipping
sallah dust all over his face looks angrily toward the concealed culprit
at once a flashing white grin splits his darkened face
indy and marion splotched with soot and oil are hiding in the flap of a tent
sallah runs into their arms and the three embrace warmly
when they break holy smoke my friends
i am so pleased you are not dead
suddenly remembering the ark
theyre taking it on a truck to cairo
where is it
sallah gestures to follow and all three run off stealthily through the mostly deserted camp
sallah indy and marion run into a hiding spot behind some water barrels near the command tent
they peek out at this activity in the big space near the command tent is parked an open german staff car inside is a blond driver and an armed guard
directly behind it is a canvas topped troop truck
at this moment belloq and shliemann are supervising the careful placement of the crated ark in the back of the truck
when it is securely placed inside we hear an ominous marching sound and nine armed nazis appear at a trot from between some tents and climb into the back of
the truck with the ark
behind the water barrels sallah and marion exchange hapless looks but indy just concentrates on the scene by the truck belloq and shliemann are about to climb into the front
staff car when they pause to check out the final component of the convoy
rolling into place behind the truck is another open staff car
but this one is special mounted in the back is a big black machine gun manned by a gunner
at the wheel of the car is gobler and next to him sits belzig
sallah and marion look at indy
belloq and shliemann climb in the back seat of the front car and the caravan pulls out
indy watches it go thinking hard
you two get back to cairo quick and get us transportation to england a plane a ship anything
what about you
im going to get that truck
ill meet you at omars
be ready for me
marion looks at him like hes nuts
indy jumps up looks around desperately
how are you going to get that truck
still searching i dont know
im making this up as i go
he runs away between two tents
from among the tents indy suddenly bursts into view happily astride a magnificent white arabian stallion
he gallops off across the desert
indy cuts cross country avoiding the road the convoy has taken
he leaps gullies climbs dunes slides down slopes
soon the convoy comes into view far below him
he tears along a parallel ridge like an indian shadowing a wagon train
the convoy is entering rougher country
the narrow mountain road weve seen earlier ascends ahead
to the side of the road are tall boulders
suddenly indy shoots out from between two rocks and rides directly for the truck
the armed nazis in the back of the truck can see nothing because the canvas hides their view
but gobler belzig and the gunner in the rear staff car have a brief line on him
belzig points and the gunner fires away and indy the bullets kicking up sand near indys horse
the armed guard in the cab of the truck leans out to see whats happening
indy has been riding alongside
now he stands on the horse and leaps to the cab
in a second he has flipped the armed guard out of the truck
he slides into the cab and begins grappling with the truck driver
the truck driver tries to hit the brakes but indy kicks his foot away and floors the gas pedal
the truck doubles its speed and shoots onto the steep mountain road
the blond driver of the front staff car sees the truck move up on him in the rearview mirror and speeds up
belloq shliemann and the armed guard in the car twist around to look at the struggle in the truck
the blond driver begins what will be a continuing preview of the twists in the road
he turns his wheel sharply and takes the lead car around a bend
in the cab of the truck indy and the truck driver stop their fight temporarily and cooperate in turning the steering wheel
the truck barely stays on the road
a full view reveals the incredible geography of this ride
the convoy in tiny against the spectacular mountainside the cliffs drop hundreds of feet
at the wheel of the rear car gobler swerves to stay on the road and accidentally sideswipes a boulder
the gunner perched in the back is flipped head over heels out of the car
gobler and belzig are having trouble seeing the road through all the dust the convoy is kicking up
the lead staff car reaches the summit of the road and barely makes the hairpin turn there delivering a destructive blow to the guard rail that has been placed there
the guard rail is now bent
in the cab of the truck indy and the truck driver again stop trying to choke each other long enough to negotiate the turn together
the bumper of the truck hits the broken guard rail and sends it flying off the cliff
the truck however holds the road
in the rear car gobler and belzig are trying to see through the thick clouds of dust
suddenly is clears completely
unfortunately for them this happens because their car has shot out into space at the hairpin turn
they are flying to their final reward
belzig eyes wide behind his evil spectacles screams as he goes
in the cab of the truck the truck driver is distracted by the sight of the flying staff car
indy plasters him and he tumbles out
far far below belzigs staff car explodes on the rocks
in the back of the truck a tough sergeant takes command of the situation
he picks out six armed nazis and motions for them to start climbing around the outside of the truck to the cab
with some trepidation the lucky ones begin that maneuver
the truck is swerving like crazy
in the front staff car the armed guard aims his submachine guns back at indy alone now in the trucks cab
shliemann knocks the barrel roughly away
yelling if anything happens to that ark were all dead men
the fuhrer will see to it
indy sees this from the cab and reacts by speeding up putting even more pressure on the blond driver
along the back of the truck armed nazis are edging up toward the cab three on each side
they hang on as the truck rounds a corner and goes into a straightaway that leads through a short tunnel
in the cab indy has been concentrating on the lead staff car
now just before entering the tunnel he looks in the side view mirror and sees the nazis on his side
a quick glance to the other mirror reveals the others
as the truck sweeps into the tunnel we see indy just start to turn his steering wheel he is going to sideswipe the walls of the tunnel at the other
end of the tunnel we hear the roar of the two engine and two long screeching scraping sounds
the lead staff car shoots out of the tunnel then the truck its sides cleaned of nazis
in the rear of the truck the tough sergeant is looking with distaste back at the tunnel
there remains only him and two armed nazis with the ark
he sends these two climbing up over the top of the truck
in the lead car the blond driver is being pressed hard by indy who now edges up to bump them from the rear
suddenly the armed guard next to the driver sees the two armed nazis appear on the top of the truck
without thinking he starts to point them out to shliemann then realizes his stupidity
in the cab indy has seen this and is at first mystified
he checks his sideview mirrors
then he figures it out and slams on his brakes
the brakes lock the wheels burn and the truck skids to a dusty halt
the two armed nazis fly off the truck over the cab to the road in front
indy immediately hits the gas again
the two armed nazis just aiming their weapons get wiped out
in the rear of the truck the crated ark is bouncing all alone no one in sight because the tough sergeant is on the top of the truck making his
way steadily forward
this guy clearly knows what hes doing
a submachine gun is slung across his back
the truck and the staff car race through a series of s curves
in the staff car belloq and shliemann spot the tough sergeant as he reaches the front of the trucks top and begins to lower his submachine gun barrel toward the
indy is unaware
belloq and shliemann exchange looks
then shliemann yells to the armed guard in the front seat
the tough sergeant has a line on indy
he points his gun
the armed guard blasts away at the truck
the tough sergeant dies in a hail of bullets and flies off
indy who has ducked at the gunfire is confused
but when he sees the armed guard up front lower his gun indy again floors it and begins bumping the staff car in earnest
the road is almost down to a level now
in the distance cairo
the road takes a little dogleg just before reaching level ground again
just as the staff car is about to make the turn indy smashes them from behind
the staff car flies off the road and down a twenty foot embankment
indy takes the truck speeding down the road and off toward cairo
in the staff car the occupants are bruised but safe
shliemann points at the departing truck and yells at the blond driver
the staff car fishtails out of its sandy resting place and takes off after the truck
indy has an ever decreasing lead on the staff car as the race thunders into the narrow streets
people and animals leap out of the way carts and barrels go flying helter skelter
indy takes the truck down a street so narrow there are only inches to spare on each side
pedestrians jump into doorways
when the truck clears the narrow street it is in a small square
omars garage is gaping open on the opposite side
indy hits the brakes and the truck skids across the square and into the garage
the garage door slams shut and tenting drops from the building to hide the door
various arabs friends of omar rush out with fruit carts and baskets and set up a mini bazaar in seconds
two arab boys sweep the tracks of the truck into oblivion
they throw aside their brooms just as the staff car appears from the narrow street
belloq and shliemann look around desperately as the blond driver steers the car through the square and out the other side
the waterfront is dark and misty
an old tramp steamer the bantu wind sits by the pier
several fierce black african pirates the crewmembers are taking on final stores
a small light illuminates the top of the gangplank
in its circle indy and marion exchange long warm embraces with sallah
a short distance away the ships captain a handsome powerful black named simon katanga watches from the rail smoking a pipe
the bantu wind is bathed in moonlight as it cuts across even seas
indy comes in takes off his hat jacket whip and holster
the door which connects this cabin to the next opens and marion appears
she is carrying a half full glass of liquor but what you notice is the long snow white high necked nightgown she is wearing
it is very prim
and very sexy
marion does a slightly embarrassed models turn for indy
i have a feeling im not the first woman to travel with these pirates
theres a whole wardrobe in there
indy sits on the cot takes off his boots
he leans back against the wall and rubs his eyes
marion sits on the bed leans back against the wall with him and looks down at her white nightgown
i feel like a virgin bride in this
thats what you look like
takes a drink there are some things you can recapture in this life but that isnt one of them
what would you like to recapture
after a long pause nothing
that is the way it is
he watches her closely as she drains her glass and puts it down
did i ever say i was sorry i burned down your tavern
she turns so their lips are very close
then again i burned up that plane
you saved my life
and you saved mine
seems things have worked out kind of even
thats the way i like them
maybe we should consider all past accounts closed
marion thinks about this a long time
she looks into his eyes
a smile jumps from her lips to his
he kisses her and they sink slowly to the cot
the ships rats are agitated
they tremble and chatter at the edges of the compartment darting about
out in the center of the hold sitting all by itself is the crated ark
hum m marion awakes with a start alone in the cot
the ship is quiet
indy is strapping on his holster
he pulls his ship and jacket from a hook
what is it
the engines have shut down
im going to find out
indy runs toward the bow then climbs some steps four at a time
a messenger pirate is hurrying to get him but flies by him on the steps
by the time the pirate stops himself indy is gone
the captain he say captain katanga is looking with concern ahead of the ship
indy appears behind him
you have most important friends
katanga turns quickly pointing with a sweeping hand
arrayed in a rough semicircle around the ship are ten german wolf submarines
all of their deck guns are manned and trained on the bantu wind
worse at least five heavily armed boarding parties in rafts are closing quickly on the ship
fast i sent my man for you
you and the girl must disappear
we have a place in the hold
go my friend
indy tears along the deck
he looks over the rail and sees two nazi rafts already next to the ship
indy flies down some stairs and starts to round a corner
suddenly he throws himself backwards out of view
three uniformed nazis are clustered near a cabin door holding the messenger pirate
now two more come out of the cabin trying to maintain their grasp on a kicking yelling marion
she is still wearing her white nightgown
more nazis clamber onto the deck and head toward indy slamming open doors rousting pirates spouting racial epithets
indy steps backwards and fades into the maze of the ship
the ship is swarming with nazis
the black pirates are herded forward subjected to rough physical and verbal abuse by the aryan supermen
the pirates are clearly under orders not to resist but not one of these strong men likes it
theyd gladly give their lives to rip the throat out of a few krauts
in the hold the door slams open and nazis pour in they smile at the sight of the crated ark
captain katanga watches as his crew is crowded into a circle of nazis on the wide deck below him
he is surrounded by belloq shliemann and several nazis two of whom are holding marion
now the nazis from the hold appear on the lower deck carrying the crated ark by means of the long poles
belloqs eyes shine at the sight
take it aboard the wurrfler
and be very careful
the ark is taken away
to a sergeant below what about jones
not a trace yet sir
jones is dead
belloq and shliemann regard him suspiciously
we killed him
he was of no use to us
the girl however has certain value where we are headed
she will bring a very good price
if that cargo you have taken was your goal then go in peace with it
but leave us the girl
it will reduce our loss on this trip
you are not in a position to ask for anything
we will take what we wish and then decide whether or not to blow your ship from the water
belloq steps forward and puts a proprietary hand on marions arm fixing shliemann with a steady look
that girl goes with me
it will be part of my compensation
im sure the fuhrer would approve
if she fails to please me you can do with her as you wish
this appeals to shliemanns nature
he signals his agreement with a gesture
belloq ushers marion away with her two keepers
the nazis have returned to their subs
shliemann is on the bridge with the wurrflers captain and the captains aides
the captain is an honorable career navy man
colonel shliemann all torpedoes are loaded
shliemann nods and continues to stare at the bantu wind as does the captain
the pirate crew is all lined across the bow
towering above the others standing on the rail proud and defiant is katanga
shliemann looks at the wurrflers captain a moment
what do you think captain
earnestly i think not colonel
nothing is to be gained
we are not at war
shliemann mulls this then turns to the hatch
let the vermin live
we must be on our way
shliemann disappears down the hatch
the captain is very pleased
a radioman speaks into his headset then follows the other aides down the hatch
in the distance the other subs begin to move away from the ship
the captain alone on the bridge looks once more at katanga
on the bantu wind katanga executes what might be taken for a salute
the wurrflers captain smiles salutes crisply then goes below pulling the hatch closed
immediately the wurrfler begins to move
and as it does we see the rail at the aft of the main deck
from nowhere a wet sleeve appears and a hand grabs the rail
indy pulls his dripping body onto the subs main deck
he has lost his felt hat once and for all
other than that his outfit is the same as always just wetter
suddenly water is washing over his feet the wurrfler is beginning to submerge
indy runs through quickly deepening water toward the haven of the conning tower
halfway there he slips and goes down
only by grabbing the base of the aftmast light does he keep from being swept away
he struggles to his feet and sloshes through knee deep water to the base of the conning tower
indy climbs the ladder to the bridge of the conning tower and looks down
the water is rising toward his fast
indy climbs the ladder to the top of the turret and braces himself between the two uprights there the foot radio mast and the foot periscope
still the ocean comes up to meet him
soon the top of the turret is under water and the radio mast is disappearing
indy shifts his grip to the periscope working his way up it and hanging on for dear life as the ocean whips at his body
the periscope is quickly going under
indy hangs on to the top three feet all that remains above
the forward movement of the sub continues but to indys slowly dawning delight the dive stops
no more of the periscope goes under
indy smiles its a pretty good smile too given the circumstances
indy pulls out his bullwhip and begins tying himself to the periscope
the sun warms that part of his body indy has contrived to keep out of the water
the rest floats out behind
indy isnt comfortable but all in all its not as terrible as he might have feared
its as terrible as indy might have feared
he looks wasted
waterlogged and exhausted
the wet leather of the whip is contracting and he must struggle constantly to keep it from cutting into his skin
several shark fins cut the surface appearing and disappearing in the bright moonlight
they are shadowing indy looks through barely open eyes at the sharks running alongside
there is nothing to be done
his eyes close
the submarine has stopped
the water is calm
the moon is bright
a gentle swell splashes indy awake
he blinks tries to regain his senses
he makes an inventory of his body
surprised to find himself intact his spirits lift
some hidden reserve of energy flows through him
he frees his aching arms from the wet leather of his whip leaving only one loop around his waist to hold him to the sub
he rubs his hands and stretches
once again he has survived
to fight again
he looks around
a lovely island
no sign of mans presence
the sub has stopped at the mouth of a wide cove completely ringed by tall white rock cliffs
suddenly the sub begins to move again
it is headed directly toward the center of the cliffs
indy holds on mystified alert
when the cliffs are very close the sub begins to dive
he thinks hard
inspiration hits just before the water
indy flips his leather jacket up over his head and holds the jacket out in front of him
his head is hidden by the jacket as he goes under water
the sub enters an underwater tunnel that penetrates into the cliffs
indy is held to the periscope by his crossed legs and the whip
his impromptu air bubble is working but its a struggle to maintain it
the sub begins to cut through think marine vegetation
each dangling growth pulls at indys body and slaps at his leather bubble
now a clump of entwined seaweed rips the leather out of his hands and his bubble of air rises away
indy hangs on holding his breath but the vegetation gets denser
finally it pulls him off the periscope
the sub moves on disappearing ahead
indy rises desperately through the dark water his hand outstretched
then almost simultaneously hand and head hit solid rock
but no air
indy feels along the ceiling of rock
its all submerged
indy dives stroking deep into the tunnel
when he has descended feet he grabs a vine and steadies himself
his eyes search the dim roof of the tunnel
he sees his last hope in the distance a small blue circle an air pocket
he swims for it
in the air pocket indys head breaks the surface and smashes into rock again
the pocket is only six inches deep
indy loves it
hed like to move in
he gulps air
the wurrfler has arrived at an extraordinary base built in the hollow interior of the island
this chamber with the docking bay is almost all water
a huge natural cavern it has been reinforced and enlarged by the germans
the wurrfler sits surfaced at the dock
the ark has been unloaded and placed on a cart
shliemann belloq and marion have just disembarked and been met by a nazi contingent from the base
marion looks worse for the trip
her white nightgown is now ripped and smudged
one of the greeting nazis a tall captain salutes shliemann and belloq
as he speaks to them we notice that right behind this group just above a great deal of sub unloading activity indys whip hangs from the periscope
working nazis pass within feet of it unaware the tall captain would see it in a moment if he were not so focused on the new arrivals
to belloq the tents have been arranged in accordance with your radioed instructions sir
we must take the ark there now
shliemann looks a little unhappy about this exchange but says nothing
the group moves swiftly toward the end of a mine train arrangement
the train consisting of small separate electric powered cars sits on a track which disappears into a tunnel cut in the rock
on the turret of the wurrfler the wurrflers captain lights a cigarette as he watches the mine train disappear then returns his attention to the activity on the dock
he leans idly against the periscope his head two feet below indys dangling whip
something catches his eye he yells an order and climbs down from the turret to deal with the matter
we hold on the whip for a long moment until its owners hand appears and quickly reclaims it
the ark and its entourage are moving slowly up the tight dark tunnel their way lit by intermittent lanterns
the tunnel is irregular but generally about feet wide
its height varies from an average of about feet to a low of only about
feet at the points every feet where support beams cross the track
the result is that there is only about a foot of clearance above the mine cars at those points passengers must duck to keep from being hit in the head
shliemann looking worried and belloq very excited are focused on the ark in the car ahead
i am uncomfortable with the thought of this spitting it out jewish ritual
are you sure its necessary
playing him let me ask you this would you be more comfortable opening the ark in berlin for the fuhrer and finding out only then if the sacred pieces of
the covenant are inside
knowing only then whether you have accomplished your mission and obtained the one true ark
shliemann doesnt like any of his alternatives
he looks at belloq with some suspicion as the train comes into bright light
a second natural cavern even bigger than the first has been worked over by the germans into a rectangular three story high supply center around a huge open center court
uniformed nazi soldiers are everywhere wrangling supplies and ammunition monitoring electronic equipment
at the far end of the court a second train tunnel disappears into the rock
across the open court belloq sees his destination a large brilliant white silk tent has been erected in the midst of all this hardware
it looks incongruous and more than a little eerie
it is the tabernacle
indy is making his way up the tunnel
he hears cars coming from up ahead and steps into the shadows
a mine car passes with several laughing nazis
indy continues on his way
the light in here is lovely unearthly
oil lamps burn
the tabernacle is really several concentric silk tents which creates a flowing maze effect
the innermost tent has at its center a foot high tapestry covered altar
belloq watches with gleaming obsessed eyes as two nazis carefully lift the actual ark out of its crate by means of the long poles
the ark dazzles the eye seeming to glow gold in this strange light
the two nazis place it carefully on the altar
shliemann and some aides hang back
marion is nowhere to be seen
indy makes a fast break from the shadows of the tunnel to the protection of a high stack of supplies
he climbs the back of the stack peeks over and surveys the area
in addition to the tabernacle the second train tunnel entrance and all the activity indys glance rests momentarily on a large heavy metal door halfway down one wall toward the
it bears the words in german indy continues to scan the scene
in the central area with the ark shliemann and the other nazis wait impatiently eyeing the ark with some discomfort
belloq is not visible because at the moment he is in the folds of the tabernacle the silk of the tents undulating around him
the light is even stranger the scene almost dreamlike
with the help of the tall captain belloq lets an extraordinary gold embroidered ceremonial robe fall over his head and onto his body
belloq looks transported possessed
the tall captain unlatches a wooden case and takes from it a sturdy ivory rod about feet long elaborately engraved
belloq takes it from him turns and slips back through the silk
the tall captain stays in the folds
back in the central area shliemann and the other nazis are taken aback by belloqs appearance in the robe
they exchange looks
from one knot of men there is muttering about juden and such but when belloq turns a fiery gaze on them there is immediate silence
shliemann looks uncertain in this presence
belloq approaches the ark
he stops a few feet from it and begins murmuring an invocation in hebrew
after a few moments of this he advances a step and is about to place the ivory rod in a notch under the lid of the ark itself
the end of the rod is an inch from the notch when indy steps into the tabernacle
on his shoulder is a bazooka and it is aimed directly at the ark
the nazi react one move from anybody and i blow that box back to moses
shliemann makes it clear to the other nazis that indy is to be obeyed
jones your persistence surprises even me
you are going to give mercenaries a bad name
what about you
talked to god yet
belloqs eyes flash wheres the girl
doctor jones surely you dont think you can escape from this base
that depends on how reasonable were all willing to be
all i want is the girl
well keep possession of the ark only till weve got safe transport to england
then its all yours
if we refuse
then the ark and some of us are going up in a big bang
i dont think hitler would like that a bit
now i dont want to talk about this anymore
show me that girl in five seconds or the tall captain flies out of the silk and takes indy down by the neck
the bazooka clatters across the cement floor as two other nazis help subdue indy
the three nazis take indys pistol from his holster and raise him roughly in their grasp
jones this is the second time i have seen you looking very foolish
its a bad habit
im trying to break it
shliemann draws his luger
ill help you
this time ill kill you myself
shliemann raises the pistol
not in the presence of the ark
take him outside
shliemann eyes belloq then the ark
he lowers the pistol motions for the nazis to take indy out ahead of him
they stop a moment only when belloq speaks
indiana jones i salute you
i am even a little sorry you will miss this moment
if you talk to him tell him im on my way up
shliemann motions them out and follows
belloq turns back to the ark raising the ivory rod
shliemann the tall captain indy and the two nazis holding him emerge from the tabernacle
shliemann points to a nearby wall and the group starts that way with shliemann and the tall captain slightly ahead
belloq has the ivory rod inserted in the notch under the lid of the ark
he utters a short phrase in hebrew and begins to press down on his end of the rod
the lid of the ark begins to lift
its difficult work
belloq puts his whole weight into one big press on his end and the lid opens two feet
inside the ark of the covenant is a preview of the end of the world
a light so bright a power so fearsome a charge so jolting that there is nothing in our world to compare to it
its as though this magnificent golden box has been gathering electric energy for three thousand years waiting for just this crack of the lid to release it all in one
fast cleansing explosion of pure force
blinding arcs of light shoot out across the tabernacle instantly killing all the nazis inside and turning the white silk to flame
but it is belloq in his obsession who takes the full blast
his whole body seems lit by a million volt current and for a moment his complete form is white then blue then maybe green but it is hard to tell
because our eyes are blinded now too
two aspects of this ghastly beautiful display are somehow communicated in the chaos although the communication is subliminal
first that belloq in the instant of his destruction has experienced some kind of sublime transcendental knowledge
if a deaths head can smile and look satisfied that is how belloqs incandescent face would be described
secondly this event is accompanied by a sound like no other
a sound so intense and so odd and so haunting that the suggestible among us might imagine it were the whisper of god
shliemann and the tall captain have been temporarily blinded by the light from the tabernacle
indy makes short work of his two escorts
he bashes their heads together
when only one goes down at this indy uses the handle of his bullwhip which has appeared instantly in his hand to put the second one down
shliemann hand on his eyes aims his luger blindly at the scuffle
indy pushes the tall captain at shliemann who fires on impact killing the tall captain
indy knocks out shliemann
behind indy the brilliant light and weird noise of the ark have suddenly ceased but the tabernacle is ablaze and the fire has quickly spread to stacks of supplies on
smoke is already starting to fill the cavern
nazis are running around yelling for firefighting water
a burning crate at the side of the tabernacle is pushed over only to knock over a drum of heavy black oil
a river of flame shoots across the cement
indy grabs a rifle with bayonet from the prostrate body of one of his former escorts and runs back into the flaming tabernacle
indy jumps through the flames into what is now a tent of fire
he looks around at the dead bodies then at the ark
the lid has slammed down shut again and the ark shines gold in the flames
before it where belloq once stood is a pile of ash and charred debris
indy registers this then continues to scan the scene
marion can you hear me
suddenly indy looks as the far side of the tabernacle burns completely away revealing marion tied spread eagle between two upright posts
her nightgown is now in tatters black with soot
she is gagged but her eyes are screaming focused on the flaming river of black oil which is about to engulf her feet
indy rushes toward her unaware of a uniformed nazi who has appeared from the flames
marion looks up to see indy and the nazi leveling his submachine gun at indy
she motions desperately with her eyes
indy dives and rolls through the flames just as the nazi opens fire
from the floor indy blasts the nazi
the river of burning oil is only a foot from marion
indy jumps up and runs toward the bound marion his bayonet aimed directly at her
her wide eyes flash between the flames and the shining blade
expertly indy slashes down both sides at marion cutting all four bindings
marion falls backwards away from the flames but before she hits the ground indy is there catching her in his arms
thank god youre here
glad i could make it
indy rises pulling her up with him
the tabernacle is burning away so fast that soon indy and marion will be completely exposed
indy rushes over and grabs the submachine gun and a luger from the dead nazi
lets get out of here
what about the ark
indy stops startled by her spunky attitude
hes considering their changes
are you game
weve made it this far
grins at her okay
lets do it
they approach the altar through the dying flames indy slinging the submachine gun over his back
the long carrying poles are still in place
whatever you do dont touch it
lets put it on the floor
each taking an end with the poles they lift the ark from the altar and lower it to the floor
marion grunts under the weight
indy registers this hands her the submachine gun
he pulls out his whip motions her back and sweeps the whip tightly around the body of the ark
the whip wraps snugly around the plaiting and indy ties it off
the ark is now harnessed to the whip handle
indy gives it an experimental pull and the ark slides across the smooth cement
indy indicates the direction of the second train tunnel
well go down that side
shoot anyone who looks at us crosseyed
two huge stacks of goods are ablaze and the nazis are having trouble getting water to them
the nazis main concern at this point is an enormous neat stack of wooden cartridge boxes which are piled down the wall from one of the already blazing and now
teetering stacks of general goods
nervous nazis are moving the heavy cartridge boxes as fast as they can but its slow work and the threatening fire is close
indy and marion make their way along the side of the center court indy grimacing with the strain of pulling the ark
one nazi stops directly in front of them looking at them queerly
indy knocks him out with the butt of his luger just as marion is about to fire
out in the court shliemann has regained his eyesight
now he crouches scanning the scene desperately for indy
he looks into the remains of the tabernacle and spots the empty altar
beyond it the unoccupied posts where marion was bound
at the entrance to the second train tunnel indy and marion struggle to lift the ark into a mine car
marion has the submachine gun slung over her back
the ark drops heavily into the bottom of the car
the noise attracts the attention of five water carrying nazis
they see whats going on and reach for their side arms
indy grabs marion pulls her in front of him as though to use her as a shield and flips the submachine gun still on her back toward the nazis
he opens fire turning marions body so he can mow all five down
shliemann spins around and looks at the tunnel entrance
he points at indy and marion who have just hopped into the mine car with the ark
a dozen nazis spin and look at the mine car
marion is just leveling the submachine gun
indy pushes forward the throttle and the mine car moves toward the tunnel picking up speed
as the nazis raise their guns to fire marion and indy both open up peppering the area with lead
as the mine car is about to disappear into the tunnel to marion get down
as the car disappears bullets pock the entrance of the tunnel
shliemann runs up with three nazis
they jump into the next mine car and take off disappearing into the tunnel
over at the burning stack of goods some terrified fire fighters scurry away as the burning pile of general goods falls over onto the stack of cartridge boxes
the wooden boxes immediately start burning
many of the nazis just want to get out of there but a couple of disciplined officers are trying to salvage the situation
they point to the far side of the court the walls are lines with oil and gas drums
we must cover the drums
protect them from the bullets
we see a most extraordinary pursuit
this tunnel is of identical design to the first except more twisty
this early section goes slightly uphill as though headed for the summit of a rollercoaster
the low cross beams and the higher sections in between are causing the nazis to alternately stand and duck in their efforts to get a clear shot at the lead
one german times it wrong and gets whacked
indy in unhappy with the speed of his car and hes right the nazis are moving faster and gaining
when both cars are in the same high section the nazis blast away at them
the noise is deafening with barking guns splintering rock and twanging ricochets contributing to the din
as marion fires a return volley low over the ark indy kicks at the throttle convinced it is jammed
the officers are directing the placement of every moveable item in front of the oil drums
desks crates chairs food all are heaped in front of the fuel
all the workers cast frequent nervous glances back at the burning cartridge boxes across the court
suddenly the worst begins to happen at the cartridge boxes
hundreds of thousands of live cartridges begin exploding flying around the court like shrapnel
hot lead begins to zing off the exposed fuel drums leaving big dents
the car with indy and marion looks almost sluggish compared to the pursuing nazi car as they both make their way into an usually long straightaway
marion discards her empty submachine gun as indy kicks at his throttle and casts a worried look back at shliemann
shliemann sensing victory smiles evilly and carefully takes aim
indy and marion will be easy targets until they reach that approaching low cross beam which is the crest of the rising tunnel
a fuel drum already pocked by bullets is finally penetrated by high velocity hot lead
it explodes in a ball of flame
and then its neighbor
then all is exploding flame
shliemann and his cohorts hear the explosions behind them and look back that way
indy kicks the throttle one more time and it goes
their car doubles its speed and shoots under the low cross beam at the same instant as a huge dragon of all consuming fire shoots up the tunnel behind the
nazis catches their car and incinerates shliemann and his men
the tunnel collapses in this section burying the fried nazis forever
indy and marion look back at the low cross beam as the last tongue of flame makes it there and then is doused by falling rock and dirt
they look at each other then turn their attention back to their own predicament
their mine car is going incredible fast as it moves into a downward section of wildly twisting tunnel
slow it down
indy is already pulling the throttle
it moves easily
unfortunately it is no longer attached to the motor
the mine car is out of control
after several moments far ahead appears a circle of bright daylight the end of the tunnel
it approaches at a frightening rate
indy reaches out and grasps marions hand
they exchange looks and then turn to look ahead
were taking this last stretch with them
its a familiar nightmare
it has to do with a rollercoaster that ends suddenly and disastrously
the shocking brightness of sunlight rushes up to engulf us blinding us in its glare
high up on the slope of the island indy and marions mine car shoots out of the black tunnel and roars down toward a little dock at the end of
a small nazi transport launch carefully disguised as a greek fishing boat sits bobbing by the dock
the only human a nazi sentry dressed as a greek peasant
he is perched on a pile of seed bags which are stacked at the very end of the train tracks
as the mine car barrels noisily down toward him he throws away some burlap to reveal a mounted machine gun which he spins quickly around toward the approaching mine car
he opens fire
in the out of control mine car indy pulls marion down with him
they are squashed into the corner trying to avoid contact with the bouncing ark
bullets clang against the outside of the car and whiz inches overhead
indy and marion are forced into a tighter and tighter embrace of life
at the machine gun post the nazi sentry has been firing like crazy but now there is terror in his eyes
he realizes the car is not going to stop
he lacks faith in his stronghold
the mine car smashes into the seed bag bunker
and right on through
the nazi sentry his machine gun and a dozen bursting seed bags are slammed into the ocean in a wild hurtling mass
the mine car jumps bounces and spins around then slides to a stop in a cloud of seed at the edge of the water
no sign of life
a large gaping doorway flames ringing it blazing into the room beyond
hanging by one hinge there its metal blasted and jagged is a heavy door with the signed lettering in german danger the first explosion happens
its a baby compared to whats coming yet it rocks the earth
and then almost immediately another
the long irregular ever larger chain of explosions begins
the island rumbles and shakes
from fissures and small natural caves dirt and rock shoot out like spraying water
still the explosion continue
a huge chunk of white cliff falls away into the turbulent sea
birds scream and soar afraid to land
finally we settle on a full shot of the island
we can recognize that the small opening high on the slope from which a cloud of smoke and dust is billowing is the end of the mine tunnel
and there below it quite small from this distance is the dock
and the boat that looks like a greek fishing boat
there can be no mistake even from this far away the boat is chugging out to sea
indy brody and marion looking very stylish are seated in colonel musgroves huge office
sun pours in a window through which washington can be seen sparkling across the potomac
everything is neat and clean and regular
including the three men who are arrayed around the office
two we know col
musgrove and maj
the third is an unnamed bureaucrat
he hangs back smiling and genial his features obscured by the glare of the window
he doesnt say anything yet you have a sense that the others defer to him in the matter at hand
he is the essence of all that is byzantine and inscrutable in our scrubbed government machine
indy and brody are dissatisfied with the way the meeting has gone
marion on the other hand is very happy and eager to get out of there
eatons manner is irritatingly cheery
youve done your country a great service
and we trust you found the settlement satisfactory
glances around at the others then i guess that about does it
when can we have the ark
eatons glance flicks over to the mysterious bureaucrat then back to brody
i thought we answered that
its someplace very safe heated thats a powerful force
research should be done oh it will be dr
jones i assure you
we have top men working on it right now
indy exchanges a look with brody
we may be able to help
we appreciate that
and we wont hesitate to call on you
dismissing them thank you all
thank you again
indy looks them over coldly
he gets up sullen
indy brody and marion emerge from the building
brody bids them farewell and moves off in another direction
marion clings to indys arm in an energetic very feminine way scolding him
well they arent going to tell you so why dont you just forget it
id think youd had enough of that damn ark
just put your mind on something else
indy stops looking across the river his mind occupied
yeah like what
marion makes a face then puts her arms around his neck and plants a humdinger of a kiss on his mouth
it goes on a while
finally they break
its not the ark
but itll have to do
they move down the steps smiling
the ark of the covenant sits in a wooden crate
a wooden lid comes down and hides it from view
the lid is solidly nailed to the crate as we read the stenciled message on top the hammering is completed and hands shift the heavy crate onto a dolly
a little old government warehouseman begins pushing the crated ark down as aisle
soon we see that the aisle is formed by huge stacks or crates
they come in many shapes and sizes but when it comes right down to it they all look like the one that holds the ark
all have markings like the message weve just seen
pretty soon were far enough and high enough away from the little old government warehouseman to see that this is one of the biggest rooms in the world
and it is full
crates and crates
all looking alike
all gathering dust
and then we notice that the little old government warehouseman pushing his new crate ahead of him has turned into another aisle and disappeared from view
