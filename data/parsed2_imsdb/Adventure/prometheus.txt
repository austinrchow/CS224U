written by jon spaihts the world turns below us vast and slow
a shadow sweeps over the land
we move with the shadow
we cast the shadow
landscapes slide by
reduced by altitude to abstractions river deltas forests and flood plains
a raw natural world
no trace of civilization
the shadow glides over mountains and glaciers
across an ocean and a pale beach
over lowland plain at the foot of a volcanic mountain it stops
three figures walk out of the shadow
they are men and yet not men
their skin is snow white
their features heavy and classical as if rodins thinker had risen from his seat
their smooth heads are earless and hairless
their glittering eyes entirely black
against the stark land their height is impossible to judge
they are engineers
two of them are cloaked in dark robes of strange design
the third is naked
one of the cloaked engineers opens a featureless black box inside lies a cake of dark sticky material
the naked one lifts the dark cake with ceremonial slowness
it hums and buzzes
foams into iridescent spheres
he raises the seething cake to his mouth like the sacrament
black scarabs boil out of the dark material
swarm over his lips
glittering insects that chitter and bite
under the swarm his lips melt away
a horrific vision of teeth black blood dissolving bone
they are devouring him
a fevered glimpse of the microscopic cells rupture and bleed
protein chains unfold
a dna spiral unravels
the scarabs fill their bellies with genetic material
spreads his arms
stands cruciform nearly headless
the scarabs swarm his shoulders his chest
when they reach his hips he collapses sideways toppling majestically like a felled tree
the two cloaked engineers watch impassively
behind them a vast black ship hangs in the sky
as if blown by a great gust of wind the scarabs disperse in their millions in all directions
living dna on the wing
where the sacrificial victim fell nothing remains
a pristine wilderness
the volcanic mountain in the distance
a primitive woman stands on a height staring in amazement far off a great dark ship hovers over the plain
a black scarab lands on the back of her neck
injecting its cargo of dna into her blood
a microscopic invasion
cells pierced and infused
dna strands twining and mating
pupils dilating with shock breath hissing into her lungs
she slaps the back of her neck
looks at her hand
the scarab lies in her palm
as she watches it crumbles to dust and blows away
drifting motes of light against the dark a starscape
an excavator floats into view a sturdy vehicle equipped with robotic arms
bright floodlights beat at the darkness
inside the cockpit a bubble of glass sits a beautiful woman
this is dr
jocelyn watts a precocious scholar of many disciplines
a scientist accustomed to field work
the cockpit is sweltering she wears shorts boots a t shirt and still her arms and legs gleam with sweat
watts works the controls
the excavator descends toward a rocky surface
silt billows up as the excavator approaches were not in space at all but deep underwater
the excavators thrusters are cowled propellers
the stars are plankton shining in the floodlights
watts steers the excavator to a steeply sloping cliff wall
a sea trench yawns below her its depths lost in darkness
moving to survey site b
closing on object four
the large oblong
she watches the screen of a ground penetrating radar system
a bright signal return something hidden in the cliff in front of her
there you are
watts carves into the cliff with the excavators digger arm
silt and boulders fall into the yawning trench below
she brings a water cannon to bear uses its jet to blast away loose silt and stones
the cliff face collapses a muddy landslide into the deeps
watts backs away from the collapse thrusters whirring to keep her out of the turbulence
a cloud of silt clears
in her floodlight beams the obelisk stands revealed its outlines worn by the ages
easily thirty feet tall
watts stares at the obelisk stunned
her voice is husky martin
a second excavator glides out of the dark
at the controls professor martin holloway visionary genius and archaeologist
dark haired and lean with the rangy build of a frontiersman
hes dressed in work trousers and a t shirt
he plays his floodlights over the obelisk
look at that
watts floats her excavator down the front of the obelisk
scanning the alien text
suddenly she stops
grips the obelisk with her excavators arms to anchor herself in place
you need to see this
holloway pilots his excavator expertly up to wattss
mates the two vehicles at their aft hatchways
behind watts a hatch opens with a splatter of water
holloway climbs in
squeezes into her cockpit
a tight fit
hes distracted by her body pressed so close but she has eyes only for the inscrutable writing outside the glass
same thing again
what do you see
an ephemeris a star map
radius inclination azimuth
more data here
if we can get epoch and equinox out of that
can we raise this thing
shakes his head hundreds of tons
a research vessel at anchor on a turquoise sea
in the distance a coastline dotted with villas
the horizon is dominated by the volcanic peak the same peak we saw in the distance in the prologue
aboard the research vessel cranes lift watts and holloways excavators out of the sea and onto the deck
under an awning prints of the obelisks faces are stretched on the deck fifteen feet long
watts and holloway crawl over the alien text red markers in hand
parsing translating calculating
theyre tanned fit the wind in their hair
the mediterranean coast in the distance
its an idyllic way to work
but theyre utterly absorbed in the task at hand
theyre still at it
lights illuminate the workspace
the obelisk prints are blanketed with markings and annotations
holloway sits at a table
watts sits on the marked up prints
both working through calculations on electronic slates
holloway looks up
i have a solution
a single match
checked it twice
watts holds up her slate it displays a set of stellar coordinates
a detailed star map
holloway holds up his own slate an exact match
they lock eyes in electric excitement
what do we do now
we go there
a gleaming space station like a five spoked wheel rotates grandly against the pacific ocean a thousand miles below
black letters on the white metal read weylands wheel
a round shuttlecraft approaches the station
a spacecraft no bigger than a private jet
holloway and watts sit strapped into acceleration chairs
the only two passengers aboard
new to space travel watts tears her eyes from the spectacle of earth outside the window
holloway plays with a pen batting it from hand to hand in the zero gravity
you do climate i do genetics
let our ancestors tell the tale
you think hes serious
serious enough to send his private shuttle
weyland can send his shuttle out for pizza
if this meeting goes like the others maybe we should
it wont go like the others
how do you know
holloway plucks the pen from the air
he points out the window where the crescent moon shines like a toothy grin
heaven smiles on our enterprise
the shuttle docks with the wheels hub a perfect fit
a gleaming capsule elevator with windows to the stars
holloway and watts float weightlessly inside moving from handhold to handhold
the door closes
watts grabs holloway by the collar
pulls them roughly together
not for the first time
they have a way
wattss hair and clothing float free shes a naiad in holloways arms
the elevator descends along the spoke to the rim
a luxurious lobby
eames era furniture in wood and chrome the pasts vision of the future
at the rim the wheels rotation supplies gravity
an elevator door opens
watts and holloway step out holloway with a sleek metal folio slung over his shoulder
the floor is the outer surface of the wheel in both directions it curves upward out of sight
the walls are all windows on one side earth rotates lazily
on the other a wheeling field of stars
david an android stands waiting for them
hes cunningly built but no one would mistake him for a real human being
my name is david
weylands eager to meet you
he strides off across the foyer
watts and holloway exchange a wondering glance and follow
david leads past models of planets moons and asteroids
holographic labels and data swirl around them
these are all the planetary bodies on which weyland industries has mining claims
the end of the hall is dominated by a huge globe of mars
markings indicate widespread surface activity
weylands crown jewel
how is that going
they say youre getting diminishing returns
its not working
its the greatest engineering project ever attempted
challenges are inevitable
weylands a determined man
peter weyland sits behind a mahogany desk
hes a warren buffet type a country sage horse sense and hard knocks
he might be seventy years old or a hundred and seventy
behind him stands director lydia vickers a slim woman of in a costly business suit
shrewd and watchful
once a great beauty she now trades in ruthlessness
david stands against the wall
watts and holloway settle into chairs in front of weyland holloway holding the metal folio
he notices watts looking curiously at david
david heres a prototype
one of a kind for now but if he performs he will be legion
his smile fades what do you want here
holloway looks at him startled
we sent you a prospectus that
assume i know nothing
lays the metal folio on weylands desk
im an archaeologist
he touches a tiny remote
holographs appear in the air over weylands desk the folio is a three dimensional imager
pictures of a younger holloway in the field excavating ruins in egypt china peru greece
in my studies i discovered a pattern i couldnt explain
every eleven hundred years sudden advances in agriculture tool use technology
something caused a great leap forward
every eleven centuries
the pattern holds as far back as our data goes
tens of thousands of years
i had to understand this
it became the focus of my work
holloway glances at watts and forges on
watts was a student of mine
watts touches her own remote
the holographic display turns to scientific diagrams
images of a very young and beautiful watts in the laboratory
i was analyzing historical changes in human dna
i found the same pattern
every eleven centuries a pulse of new information in the genome of the human race
all over the world
evolution cant do that
something was changing us
changing the dna of our species
humanitys been visited
beings from somewhere else
behind weyland vickers cant suppress a scowl of disdain
you mean aliens
the others had forgotten vickers was there
lydia vickers director of operations
practically my right hand
they guided us to civilization
lifted us up again and again
i call them the engineers
once you know what youre looking for its amazing how the evidence falls into place
photographs flicker through the display holloway and watts in the field excavating new sites
their finds columns of writing on stone tablets in egypt china cambodia peru
patterns of lines curves and dots
this is the writing of the engineers
weve found it on every continent
and last year we found our rosetta stone
the display shows the engineer obelisk under the sea
the writing is a formula giving the location of a single star in our sky
were keeping that confidential for now
but thats where we want to go
you want me to pay for an interstellar research expedition
its a chance to be part of a revolution in scientific
dont sell me professor
youve been turned down by every university and government agency under the sun
nobodys going to gamble that kind of money on your hunch
this is a bloodbath
nobody but me
ive read your research
our research is quantum encoded on secure servers yeah
we have an a
division you should know
doing impressive things
he leans across the desk i know which star youre wishing on
the scientists stare at weyland
zeta two reticuli
he regards their shocked faces with satisfaction
you know how i got this rich
i ask myself what does god spend his time doing
and i go and do that
watts laughs incredulously
weylands not joking
biotechnology was good to me
lately doing well with gravity systems
he swivels his chair toward the window
earth shines outside
but whats the first thing god did
he made the heaven and the earth
weyland jabs a finger at her like shes won a carnival prize
thats what im talking about
you left out my favorite part
the piece about earth
for eons earths climate swung from hothouse to ice age
explosions of life then mass extinctions
but twelve thousand years ago the swings stopped
the holocene epoch began a period of anomalous tranquility
the rise of civilization began only then
holloway and watts stare at david with new appreciation
and that change coincides with a visit by the engineers
they didnt just change us
they changed our world
thats the piece i mean
he swivels back to his desk
rummages in a drawer
my people checked your science
they say its solid
he pulls a thick contract out
drops it in front of holloway
ill give you your expedition
ship and crew supplies support
holloway picks up the contract with the cautious joy of a man double checking a lottery ticket
his voice is husky whats that
you get the discovery
control of the site
but any technology you find
anything at all
holloway reaches out slowly and picks up the contract
riffles the pages of small print legalese
you take david with you
my eyes and ears
youre going too
vickers stares at weyland in shock
a glittering formation of white crystals
diamond on diamond
the structures grow more complex as the view widens
leaves and branches of crystal
a shimmering field of white jewels
a landscape of white crystals smooth as snow
a black void shot with stars far from any sun
a sturdy prospecting ship forges through space travel worn but built to last
it carries the weyland industries logo
the name painted on its hull is magellan
the ships nerve center and control room
six control stations empty and quiet
interior lights dimmed to blue
the entire forward bulkhead of the bridge is a window wall to wall floor to ceiling
at the window stands the android david
he gazes at the cosmos with an expression of utter serenity
after a long moment he turns away
massive shutters close over the window as he walks off
david walks the ships long central corridor
the ship is silent
the lights dimmed to blue
he is alone
a long steel room containing a dozen plexiglass sarcophagi six on each side
inside each freezer the shadowy shape of a human body rimed with frost
david walks through the compartment surveying the sleepers
david sits at a display table moving intricate technical documents across the surface with waves of his hands
his eyes intent on his work
if he is reading then he s reading at a speed no human could match
we pull away from the frosted crystalline horizon the smooth white curves like snowy fields
form becomes clear
its the body of a woman
watts lies asleep in her underwear in a plexiglass freezer
frost on her skin
venus sculpted in ice
there are iv lines in her elbows and ankles
shapes move into view beyond her outside the freezer
pressed to the glass
all of the freezers are open and empty save two
holloway lies in one
in the next watts
three men in blue coveralls crouch beside wattss freezer staring inside
they are downs a lean fidgety crewman
stillwell a sturdy fellow with the geniality of a labrador
and kamarov whose dark brooding air belongs to a man twice his age
look at that
kamarov opens the lid of watts freezer
leans over her
watts stirs in her sleep a drowsy angel
she wakes up slow
watts wakes to find three men looming above her
disoriented she pulls away
tangles her hands in her iv lines
get out of there
holloways voice cracks like a whip
the crewmen jump back
holloway sits up in the next freezer over
he yanks the iv lines out of his arms and legs
climbs out of the freezer
give us a moment will you
the crewmen file out stillwell sheepishly downs and kamarov surly
holloway goes to watts
gently removes the iv lines from her ankles while she plucks the ones from her arms
im out of sorts
he helps her up
holloway and watts sit at a table both a bit hung over
they wear civilian clothes
warmly dressed they still look cold
they nurse mugs of coffee and nibble packaged snack bars
watts hunches over shivering
my heads buzzing
you just slept two and a half years
like youve done this before
ive read all about it
two ships officers enter the room wearing blue coveralls with rank insignia glasse a stocky man with thick black hair and brick a bald man with a bristling mustache
they look at watts and holloway with little pleasure
captainll see you now
captain janek sits at his desk
with his bristling beard and powerful build he has a swashbuckling look like the captain of a whaling ship
holloway and watts sit on a steel bench in front of him
he sits scanning his orders a plastic packet with weyland industries logos cracked open
watermarked papers inside
zeta two reticuli was surveyed already
a hundred years ago
by an unmanned probe
no earthlike planets
so what are you looking for
proof of the engineers existence
confirmation of professor holloways theories would change everything
thered be science before holloway and science after
janek rubs his face wearily with his hands
ill put the ship where you want
run your scans
captain your crews been up for a week
we couldve used the time
whyd you wait to wake us
better for discipline
off their silence men ship out as prospectors for one reason the percentage
find a gold mine or a habitable planet and youre set for life
he laughs bitterly but this contract says no percentage
just triple pay
the men arent happy
you unhappy too
im always unhappy
presses his palm against a wall panel
a safe opens
he pulls out a massive pistol in a gunbelt
tosses the orders into the safe
lays the gun atop them and locks it up
holloway and watts take possession of their cabin a simple but spacious room with twin beds and a window to the stars
they drop duffel bags on the bed
holloway surveys the arrangement
he releases the magnets that lock the beds down
slides the beds together
holloway and watts set up their workspace a central display table and huge display surfaces on the walls
fascinating documents slide under their fingertips an engineer alphabet
climate and genetic data
david appears in the doorway
i wondered when wed see you
i trust your database is in order
i set it up myself
alls well i think
david turns to go
hesitates in the doorway
i should tell you the time you spent sleeping i spent studying your research
holloway and watts look at the android his words sinking in
you studied our work for two and a half years
its quite a data set
so youve seen everything
what do you think
david glances over the documents displayed around the room
your hypothesis is
the audacity of it
your climate datas undeniable the holocene epoch was engineered
watts your genetic studies are equally conclusive
pulses of cultural change are harder to prove but even there your case is strong
i believe in your engineers
a utilitarian sitting room
steel benches and table bolted to the deck
seated here are two weyland industries technicians andrew chance a stocky computer engineer with a genial bearing and a bristling salt and pepper mustache
mona ravel a dour rangy woman with a plain face her hair pulled severely back
a physicist and chemist
they wear black weyland industries jackets
they radiate intelligence and competence
these are pros
david leads holloway and watts past the break room
holloway spots the technicians
strides in to greet them
you remember dr
watts and the technicians exchange greetings
about the materials i gave you
some of the technical aspects
well handle our end of the job
if there is a job
holloway blinks at her
chance explains not unkindly we only have a job if you find something
holloway and watts follow the imperturbable david down a steel corridor to vickerss cabin door
an open plan cabin like an urban loft apartment
watts and holloway follow david inside
vickers rises to meet them
the walls are industrial steel but the floors are lushly carpeted the furniture opulent
a king sized bed a mahogany desk a dining table
gleaming machines ensure vickers never need step outside a private hypersleep freezer an autokitchen a medical pod
is that a pauling medical pod
theres only ten of those things on earth
i guess nine now
i told mr
weyland i wouldnt compromise my standard of living
he accommodated me
i know i had to cut my manifest
this used to be the number four cargo bay
what can i do for you professor
holloway gestures with the slate hes brought with him
were about to reach the system periphery
i thought youd want to see the search protocols we no
i was set to be the next ceo of weyland industries
then you came along and sold mr
so here i am
out of the running
ill go where im told
but dont ask me to play along
but when you get back
ill be five years behind the curve
out of touch
you might make the discovery of the ages
vickers looks at him as if shes dealing with a child
you dont believe in what were doing
she walks them toward the door
now were out of communication you can tell the crew what were doing
they dont know
they volunteered blind
classified job triple pay
the crew brick glasse stillwell downs and kamarov sit on crates in an improvised lecture hall
holloway and watts in front of them
janek at the back of the room
a hologram shows ancient images of divine visitations
the crew is visibly spooked
you shitting me
stillwell is staring at the frightening images gods and titans towering over mortals
i think all our mythologies are race memories of the engineers
horus the sun god
prometheus bringing fire from heaven
a pillar of fire a pillar of smoke
the engineers are the gods
kamarov stiffens smelling blasphemy
the mythology gods maybe
god is god
let him talk
stillwells staring unhappily at the ancient images gods towering over mortals inhuman and terrifying
so were going to meet these things
we probably wont meet anyone
youd expect a star traveling race to generate radio or laser signals
fusion drives and gravity drives have clear signatures
but zeta two reticuli is silent
and the engineers have gone missing on earth
by the pattern they shouldve come to earth seventeen centuries ago
and again six centuries ago
but no sign
after twelve thousand years
they stopped coming
my god my god why have you forsaken me
janek grins at holloway across the cargo bay
is that the question youve come light years to answer
only my first question
i have many
the magellan arrives at the periphery of the system
a distant star like earths sun surrounded by orbiting planets mere sparks at this distance
outside the vast bridge window the star zeta reticuli burns a cold beacon in the night
downs glasse and brick sit at consoles
janek paces in front of the window
holloway and watts enter and gape at the view
janek grins at their reaction
welcome to zeta two reticuli
edge of the system
open her eyes
the magellan opens its eyes two immense telescopes emerge from the ship
irises open to expose huge lenses
antennae deploy unfurling like wings gleaming and vast
sifting vacuum for any whisper of information
outside the window the planets orbiting zeta reticuli are no more than bright stars
a heads up display appears overlaid on the glass
the sun is labeled zeta reticuli
markers point out the planets and trace the ellipses of their orbits
like magic the planets swell into colorful orbs each labeled alpha beta gamma
two hot rocks two gas giants three snowballs
watts grins at holloway eyes shining
first humans in the system
vickers walks onto the bridge with david
good of you to join us
what did i miss
just getting warmed up
you know what you want
emr scan thirty hertz to three hundred gigahertz
spectroscopic passes on every planet and major moon
infrared and albedo scan for hot spots and light sources
man knows what he wants
twin telescopes spin and zoom
antennae flex and focus
the planet nearest the sun rushes closer as the mighty telescopes zoom in
the magellans sensors peel planet alpha like an onion and put it back together again
a river of data floods the display bathing the watchers faces with light chemical compounds magnetic field lines lunar orbits topographical data
the scan moves on to the next planet and the next
negative on radio chatter system wide
negative for laser and maser
on the h
the data stream completes the last planet
begins to illuminate the gas giants moons
no biological markers
no artificial light
no industry or agriculture
piss poor too
low in heavy elements
got a hit
the display centers on epsilon a gas giant with many moons
data flickers around one of the larger moons lv
eighty six percent earths mass
atmospheres nitrogen methane sulfates
faint returns for a bunch of metals
the sensors complete their pass on the systems last moon
that is all
take us in
you heard the man
eighteen hours to orbit
the magellan retracts its vast antennae and telescopes
the engines fire the ship rockets toward the gas giant epsilon and its mysterious moon
leaving the bridge holloway and watts find themselves walking aft alongside david
enjoy the show
i dont know that i enjoy things
it was informative
it was it was
you know ive seen more convincing humanoid robots
watts smiles watching holloways sport
davids speech never varies from its agreeable tone
my designs not intended to convince
simulating humanity is a complex task that diverts resources
my designers dispensed with that burden to optimize for intelligence
why look like a man at all
why not be a box on wheels
being shaped like you i can use spaces and equipment designed for you
but im not so limited
i hear frequencies you cant hear
i see wavelengths of light invisible to you
i move faster
exert greater force
the scientists look at david in wonder
you see yourself as a superman
he turns his unearthly eyes on them
not a man at all
holloway and watts lie on their bed in their clothes her head on his chest
what if theyre really there
off his confusion the engineers
they could be there
waiting for us
then all my dreams come true
the magellan has arrived
lv is a gray moon shrouded in clouds
behind it looms its father planet epsilon a lurid gas giant banded in red and gold half swallowed in darkness
the magellan dives into a forced orbit around lv rockets firing continually nose pointed down
telescopes sensors and antennae sprout once more from its hull
janek and his crew seated at control stations
holloway and watts standing on the foredeck
vickers and david
ravel and chance
lv fills the window a gray orb of mist
the ground invisible beneath the clouds
sporadic lightning flickers
start with passive systems
were uninvited guests
lets be quiet
that thought sends a nervous shiver through the others
janek nods at glass and brick
they study their instruments
a lot of electromag all random
going to bugger up our scans
radar emitters extend from their housings like cannons
a thump of power as they hammer out a blast of energy
the display paints data on the moonscape as the wavefront comes back terrain rendered in luminous green
well we just rang the doorbell if anybodys listening
kamarov shakes his head fearfully
what do we see
icecaps at the poles
cold down there
the display fills with light a wave of terrain data sweeping across the moons surface as the magellan orbits
terrain data rezzing up
we got hard spots
a jolt of excitement pounds through everyone on the bridge
the magellan sweeps on around the gray moon radar emitters humming antennae and telescopes open wide
the gas giant epsilon fills the sky behind lv
as it circles the magellan launches satellites
metal motes hurled into polar orbits around the moon
twenty four hard spots shine on the moons surface an irregular array circling lv
thats not natural
you see stuff like that sometimes
big one there
a new signal appears on the map
brighter than the others
no comm signals
no signs of life
i want to get below the clouds
the prospecting ship descends through buffeting grey clouds
telescopes and antennae stowed away
hull streaming vapor as it cuts atmosphere
lightning flashes and booms around the descending ship
everyone strapped into chairs except janek who stands gripping a stanchion his boots planted on the deck
the landing engines roar
wind screams over the hull
mist whips across the bridge window obscuring any view
watts reaches out
squeezes holloways hand
the magellan breaks through the cloud cover into clear air
below the ship a vast and eerie landscape is revealed
wide valleys mottled with thin dark ground cover
barren crags and spires of rock
waterless and wind swept
stares at the grim and foreign country
the magellan thunders over valleys and craggy ridges of rock
janek takes the helm
guides the magellan down a valley as if it were a helicopter
a pilot born
coming up on site seven
they crest a mountain higher than everest
before them stretches a dry barren plain
scattered rocky peaks rise from the desert floor an alien monument valley
holloway points to a smaller mountain peak
janek expertly swings the magellan sideways
the magellan circles the mount nose pointed inward
it revolves below the watchers flat faces clean edges but cracked and timework
it glitters like coal
are we recording
glasse nods irritably
of course theyre recording
vickers stares at the pyramidal peak nonplussed
teetering on the brink of belief
watts scans the data readouts
tungsten tantalum aluminum
that could be technology
lets see the next one
a second oddly regular peak even more decrepit than the first sits on the brink of a vast canyon
landslides have eaten at its edges
the magellan purrs over the landscape dwarfed by the scale
drops between the canyon walls to circle the mount
holloway and watts stare at the structure
beginning to get over the shock
thinking like scientists again
identical apart from weathering
could be a rock formation
carbon crystallizes like that
the scientists pay him no mind
theyre past that
lets see the big one
janek pilots by instruments alone
clouds obscuring the view
closing on the major site
the ship descends into clear air
a stunning panorama unfolds before them craters hundreds of meters across connected by trenches
like a pattern of crop circles sunk in the rock
in the middle of the central crater a huge angular peak larger than the others
the magellan circles the site
its awe inspiring
holloway stares in rapture
glances at watts she nods eyes shining
shes with him
the crews still skeptical but starting to wonder
they shake their heads and exchange looks
no heat sources
cold as the grave
watts looks out at the timeworn peak
its eroded facets
i dont think anybodys been home for a long time
from the central crater four canals extend outward like points of the compass
some connect to smaller craters
one canal peters out flush with the desert floor
the magellan lands at the end of this canal half a kilometer from the central crater
they stare out the window down the wide straight canal at the pyramidal peak in the distance
holloway looks around
janek glances at his instruments
theres only six hours of daylight left
maybe you should hold off
watts looks at him incredulously
weve got that outside the windows and you want to wait til tomorrow
the expedition party emerges from the airlocks riding cargo rovers robotic vehicles just smart enough to carry their owners around or follow along behind them
the rovers beds are loaded with gear the explorers ride on running board seats
all wear space suits
holloway drives the first rover with watts beside him
stillwell kamarov and downs in back
david drives the second rover with milburn fifield chance and ravel aboard
the air here will kill you so keep an eye on your supply and watch your seals
pathogen tests are clean
dont touch anything
things may be more fragile than they look or more dangerous
there might be technologies operating here we dont understand
the crew of the magellan exchange uneasy looks
still uncertain what to think
the trench grows deeper as they follow it toward the central crater the pyramidal peak framed ahead of them like a monument on a triumphal avenue
they cross a perpendicular canal
glancing left and right they see smaller craters with central peaks of their own
they pass through the shadow of a high promontory of stone atop one bank of the canal
we see and they do not that the far side of the promontory has a sphinx like face of monumental size
so eroded that its artificial nature is uncertain
the crater floor is a vast enclosed plain
the pyramidal mount looms in the center colossal in scale
the rovers enter the crater trailing plumes of dust
they circle the pyramid
on the south face of the pyramid an iris door of many blades stands easily fifty feet high
seemingly made of the same basaltic stone as the pyramid itself
a huge construction
the explorers are transfixed in awe
all skepticism banished
tell me thats a natural formation
undeniable proof of alien civilization
you were here on this day thirty one december year of our lord
history will remember your names
watts stares at the iris
its bottom most blade is broken it lies in rubble at the foot of the door
a dark knife like aperture leads into the pyramid
the doors open
janek and vickers watch the explorers progress in the main holographic display their tinny voices echoing over the comm link
at the sight of the huge iris door in the pyramid both janek and vickers stare in blank astonishment
son of a bitch
they were right
he turns to stare out the window at the pyramids peak
vickers turns and slips out of the bridge
vickers strides through her quarters
on the far wall there are two small doors
she opens the first steps into a luxurious bathroom
washes a pill down with a tumbler of water
returns to her cabin and opens the second small door
a chamber walled with steel panels
a deep hum of ventilation and power theres a lot of technology here
she turns to a console beside the door
flips a row of switches
the hum deepens
hidden mechanisms stir to life
on foot explorers press inside holloway and watts in the lead
their flashlights cut into the gloom
the robotic rovers follow them their six wheeled chassis with independent suspension trundling over the rubble barrier sure footed as goats
dark and cavernous
weak daylight slants in
the explorers press into the darkness on foot the cargo rovers headlights flashing on
they move through a dark cathedral space empty and bare
david looks around in fascination his eyes raking the walls
his voice trembles with urgency
he shines light on the rock
symbols engraved on the dark surface
dots lines and arcs
the writing of the engineers
david stands beside them
stares at the alien writing
congratulations professor holloway
watts passes her light over the writing recording it
they move on into the dark
the interior is a labyrinth
corridors big as railway tunnels intersecting and diverging
the explorers wend their way deeper
several carry map units whose holographic displays render three dimensional maps that expand as they explore
holloway leads the explorers deeper into the complex
the motors of the cargo rovers whine and growl
david trails the others eyes raking the blank walls as if he sees something there
he reaches out
passes his hand through the air as if grasping a cobweb
a strange rumbling noise sounds down the corridor freezing them
holloway sweeps his light that way
the sound comes again a demonic voice speaking some unearthly language
watts looks at holloway but his eyes are focused on the dark ahead
he moves forward
the others follow
an apparition appears before them
a pale luminous giant fifteen feet tall with hollow eyes and a grotesque snout
it strides toward them
speaks in a sonorous voice
watts backpedals involuntarily
seeing holloway stand his ground she reaches out to him in a panic
but holloway doesnt budge
stares at the apparition in fascination
everyone else scatters except david who stands stock still by the wall
watts watches as the apparition walks right up to holloway
disappears with a sizzle of static as holloway experiences the creature passing through him
watts returns to holloways side
stillwell and downs are huddled on the deck
milburn and fifield have fallen back down the passageway
it wasnt real
we all saw it
unseen by the others david reaches out and repeats his gesture in the air
a rumbling sound down the corridor as before
moments later the apparition appears round the corner again
they stand their ground the ghostly giant strides toward them exactly as before and disappears with a crackle
get a grip
im a prospector
you find a load of bauxite im your man
but not this
i should go with him
he hauls a heavy rolling case out of the cargo rover
you can deploy the drones
drop them in the first or second nexus on your way back
give us a rover
and half our gear
its no more than a mile
you can walk it
sulking milburn takes the rolling case
the remaining explorers watch fifield and milburn backtrack into the dark
holloway and watts lead their party up to a massive door sealed tight
in design and scale undeniably important
holloway glances at his map
this should lead to the core of the pyramid
jack it open
or cut through
lets do as little damage as we can
ravel waves a sensor over the wall
current flowing in the wall
chance begins to inspect the frame of the door
maybe we can hack it
has to be a mechanism
david looks as if they fail to see something obvious
he points at a spot on the wall beside the massive slab
pull up a rover
i want to get up there
janek stands at the window looking down the long canal at the distant pyramid
the ships powerful imaging systems stream data stereoscopic feeds from the explorers flashlights a map that grows as they explore
the maze under the pyramid drawn in light
a globe of lv blooms with terrain and weather data as the satellites feed the ship information
vickers appears at janeks side
taking an interest
its my operation isnt it
a junction where multiple passageways converge
milburn and fifield trudge into the space trundling the probe cases behind them
tunnels lead away in all directions
what do you think
grand central station
they open the case
camera probes tumble out spheres the size of softballs studded with lenses and sensors
tiny lights come on as the probes awaken
they roll off dispersing to investigate every passageway
bumbling into walls and pillars reversing
exploring by random walk
lets check the feed
gimme the map
you had the map unit
you dont have the map
they stare at each other
are you serious
he trudges back the way they came in disgust
david stands on top of one of the cargo rovers
hes cut a hole in the wall beside the door high up he works with probes in the mechanisms inside
looks like a three state switch
a deep boom echoing inside the ancient walls
he moves a control
the immense door begins to rise
the vast central chamber of the pyramid
an immense space
holloway walks in his flashlight searching
watts hurries after
the others follow rovers tagging along
a colossal structure stands in the center of the chamber convoluted and strange
chasms yawn in the floor all around it their depths lost in darkness
the explorers enter rovers in train
they lift their eyes hundreds of feet above them they see the pyramids apex from within
a shaft of diffuse light penetrates the pyramid somewhere near the peak
this is something now
yes it is
the androids awareness is keyed to a high pitch
he seems to read meaning in the inscrutable structures all around them
holloway hauls a drone case out of the rover
two dozen spherical drones tumble out wake up and roll off into the dark
they are nimble hopping curbs and skirting chasms
watts looks at her atmosphere sensor
this airs breathable
the core chamber brightens as the sun outside moves into alignment
the shaft of light perfectly centered
a vast sigh as if the pyramid itself is breathing
a fat drop of water falls on wattss glove
she looks up in surprise
another falls on her visor
and then its raining inside the pyramid
water trickles into the chasms inundating the mossy growths that cling to the walls
holloway looks at watts with a little boys grin
miracles and wonders
the shaft of light moves on
the core chamber dims slightly
the rainfall stops as suddenly as it started
the explorers follow the main path around the periphery of the chamber past a gallery of mysterious machines
there are marvels in the shadows
cells in the dark apparatus open on startling deposits of color translucent alabaster flutes
honeycombs of pure gold
matrices of crystal
watts waves a scanning instrument as she walks
intense field readings
huge power sources here
they arrive at a wide opening in the floor
a strange ramp curves downward its floor segmented and saw toothed
a bafflement its not a staircase
not an escalator
no moving parts
no rails or tracks
space below us
a big space
as they stand looking a probe bumbles up to the opening and goes bounding down the ramp
how does this work
she begins to descend on foot
holloway behind her
stillwell downs and kamarov grudgingly follow
but david looks away across the cavernous chamber fixated on the central crystal
he beckons ravel and chance to follow him and walks away
ravel and chance look at each other in astonishment
uncertainly they follow david
holloway watts and the crewmen reach the bottom of the ramp breathing hard
a cargo rover trundles down after them
they look back up
the ramp above them is empty
whereve you gone
where are you
to watts indignantly they didnt come down
but watts is staring through an archway
she walks in
a passageway punctuated by alcoves as big as band shells
in each alcove stands a biomechanical apparatus shaped from the same dark material as the pyramid itself
each apparatus implies by its design that a giant is meant to fit inside it
holloway and watts walk the concourse playing their lights over the dark machinery
their footsteps echo
do you see the size of them
like that ghost we saw
it wasnt a ghost
where are the others
i dont want to go back up
watts fiddles with her suits comm controls
they switched to channel three
i hear them talking
we should stay together
milburn and fifield are lost
they bumble through the dark
this is not the same place
that is the same freaky thing we saw before
he points at a detail of the architecture
no its not
the other one was more
taps his comm milburn to magellan
holloway and watts round a corner and stop in their tracks
kamarov stillwell and downs almost run into them
the scientists stand frozen
in front of them lies a dead giant
if he were standing he would be fifteen feet tall
he is roughly human in shape
withered to the bones
there are bulky protrusions fused with his flesh hard to say whether they are equipment or parts of his body
his head lolling to one side is severed from his body
his eyes seem to be covered by goggles but if so then the goggles are fused with his skull
an elephantine proboscis severed now once connected to a protrusion on his hip
the giant lies frozen in a convulsion of agony
his jaw gaping in a silent scream
his corpse is marred by hideous wounds slashes that cut through bone
the explorers move closer
god in heaven
he lifts his light
beyond the dead giant a vision of hell a dozen dead engineers lie heaped against a sealed door
twisted in postures of torment murdered in the attempt to escape
all bear horrific wounds
scene of an ancient massacre
janek and vickers stare dumbstruck at a d view of the dead giants captured by the explorers cameras
the explorers circle the decapitated giant hushed with awe
holloway steps close
there were giants in the earth in those days
and when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men they bare children to them who became mighty men
genesis six four
lays a gloved hand reverently on the giants ribs
you said dont touch anything
you said dont touch anything
the size of them
in all the old mythologies the visitors from the sky were giants
watts joins holloway beside the dead engineer
touches the corpse in her own turn
its hard as stone ossified
she traces the ancient terrible wounds
they were killed
all of them
downs stands staring at the dead giant as shaken as kamarov
we shouldnt be here
the dead cant hurt you
adjusts his communicator david
ive got something here
communications are going to hell
one of the magellans satellites hurtles along high above the moons atmosphere
it passes over the terminator line between the night side and day side
through the clouds below a lightning laced storm front rolls across lv like a wave
rising winds pluck at the ground cover outside the window
janek turns from the view to look at the holographic globe
back to the ship
we got a mean storm front rolling in
standing beside the dead giant watts and holloway look at each other as the signal comes in
back to the ship
weve found something here
im not walking away for bad weather
janek shouts into his communicator
i got two hundred kilometer winds with airborne silica and enough static to fry your suits
get your asses back here
holloway races their cargo rover away from the pyramid wheels kicking up dust
watts rides in back securing a bulky payload under a tarp on the cargo deck
stillwell downs and kamarov clinging miserably beside her
watts looks back a massive storm front chases them
a tidal wave of dust shot through with lightning
gale force winds tear at the ground
lightning lashes the pyramid and the crater wall
reaching the magellan they see the other rover already in the airlock lift
david ravel and chance aboard
holloway roars into the lift at speed the rover skidding almost into the opposite wall
watts leaps down
the storm wall catches up to them
screaming winds rip through the lift
dust fills the air
visibility plunges toward zero
help me unload
she pulls at the tarp
it tears halfway free and fills with wind snapping taut with such violence that watts is hurled out into the storm
watts tumbles helplessly a leaf in the wind
crashes into a metal stanchion
clings the wind knocked out of her
nothing but static in her headset
holloway stares in shock at the place where watts vanished
with inhuman reflexes david reacts
grabs a tether
latches it to his suit
locks it to an anchor point on the wall
dives into the storm
a ballet nearly too fast to follow
david lets the wind take him
skids across the ground controlling his trajectory
he hits the stanchion where watts is lodged with a clang as if he were made of iron
watts stares at him in mute astonishment
he locks her suit to his
activates the tether units winch
it whirs reeling them in through the hurricane
holloway and the other crewmen haul watts and david back inside
holloway and watts embrace fiercely as the lift rises toward the safety of the ship
the crewmen bundle the rovers tarp wrapped cargo into a sealed dumbwaiter that rises independently into the ship
the explorers strip off space suits
watts pulls her helmet off
catches davids eye across the airlock
mouths a silent thank you
he gives her the barest nod and vanishes into the ship
the explorers exchange looks
a mood of exuberance and wonder prevails now that theyre safe home
smiles of wonder as what theyve seen comes home
got to hand it to you professor
you were right
both of you
whats in the tarp
whatd you bring back
the explorers from watts and holloways party exchange looks and burst into laughter
you dont want to know
were two helmets short
the lockers labeled milburn and fifield stand closed
the helmet racks empty
the laughter cuts off
they didnt come in
they stare at each other listening to the wind wail outside
janek speaks urgently into the communicator
between the wind speeds and the static electricity theres no safe way to get to you
youre going to have to hunker down until it passes
how are your provisions
we got air
water and food tabs suits
fifield and milburn stand miserably in a murky passageway
fifield hitches up his space suits crotch uncomfortably
yeah were piped
i hate these fucking things
we hate these fucking captain
maybe next time youll mind your maps
keep your heads down
well come get you in the morning
a burst of static answers him fifields voice scrambled by the storm
all hands present excepting the two missing men
janek plays his squeeze box its archaic music filling the air
tired and exuberant the men sway and dance mockingly
holloway has a champagne bottle open in each hand
he fills steel cups left and right
what we do here marks the greatest achievement of our species
contact with another civilization
humanity came of age today on this moon
you were there
raises his glass to history
they raise cups and drink
even the crew moved by the moment
but janek smiles crookedly and toasts again
to milburn and fifield
the first human beings to freak out get lost and sleep in their suits in the ruins of an alien civilization
a vast dark maze
milburn and fifield grope their way through the dark with flashlights
the storm howls outside
what are you looking for
groping along the wall someplace things cant come at us
whats gonna come at us
david stands beside vickers at her holography terminal
he lays his hand on over a signal plate and the terminal lights up with a three dimensional image
the core chamber of the pyramid from davids point of view
its apparent that davids eyes see more than human eyes do
he seems to see heat and electromagnetic energy as well as visible light calibrated readouts are overlaid on the scene
the structures in the pyramid are surrounded by complicated patterns of energy
this is incomprehensible technology
the core of the pyramid
vickers goes rigid looking at it avarice in her eyes
were going to protocol two
a high tech science facility behind glass
watts and holloway in lab gloves and smocks open the dumbwaiter
an engineers head rises into view ghoulish and elephantine
vapor rises from it
a readout blinks sterilized
they lift it onto the steel table
it takes both of them
they pass scanners over the skull
images accumulate and rotate on the laboratory displays
x ray and ultrasound
holloway leans close to study an x ray image
he almost seems to see a ghostly second face
she traces the head with an ultrasound probe under the vibrations a seam opens up around the edge of the face
she gets a fingertip into the seam
works with a probe
pries away the long dead engineers mask
it comes free
the visage revealed is human except for its giant scale
withered but beautiful as a greek statue
an expression of suffering on its face
watts drops the ultrasound probe in shock
they look like us
we look like them
and god created man in his own image
in his own image created he him
vickers and david stand outside the lab window staring in at the gods head
vickers looks shaken
watts covers her nose in revulsion
a horrible stench the engineer head begins to disintegrate in front of them
flesh oozing skin peeling
its breaking down
urgently they ransack cabinets and storage rooms
watts finds a clear plastic drum and dumps its contents
holloway drags five gallon jugs of preservative out of a cabinet
david watches through the window almost amused
mortal after all
they lift the rotting head into the drum retching
fingers skidding in putrefaction
they pour formaldehyde over it
as soon as the head is immersed they rush to strip off their reeking gloves and smocks scrubbing their hands
the gods head sits in its murky vat shedding skin and tofu like chunks of white flesh
the noble face disintegrating
watts and holloway stare at it breathing hard from their work
vickers flicks on the intercom from outside the window
your cadavers interesting
but im more interested in the machinery in the pyramid
the core chamber
what do you think it does
watts stares at vickers incredulously
how could anyone know
i know what it does
holloway looks at vickers wearily as if hes seen this conversation coming
he glances at watts
what weve seen
what we know
watts rises to the challenge
thinking on her feet
twenty four pyramids scattered around the moons equator
massive power supplies
vents in the walls
shes got it the pyramids are terraforming machines
holloway grins exuberant
his theory playing out perfectly
he doesnt see vickers stiffen
her hands curling into fists
thats why earths ancient cultures built pyramids in imitation of the gods
twelve thousand years ago beings from the sky set pyramids on the earth and transformed the world
thats what they were doing here before their civilization failed
watts stares at the head in its tank
the severed neck
it didnt fail
it was wiped out
milburn and fifield have bunked down in a new chamber they slouch against a wall
milburn sweeps the room with his headlamp
stoops to lift something into the light
look at this
a centipede three feet long and thick as mans thumb
its hard shell is gray
it has a hammer head like a shark
put it down
he leaps back wild eyed
milburn laughs at him
lets the eyeless centipede wind its segmented body around his space suited arm
in the flat face a white vertical slit appears
changes quickly to a horizontal position opens enough to suggest a mouth
milburn doesnt notice this development
your suits bug proof
hell its bulletproof
the centipede spirals around his arm glittering its body moving in fluid waves
the blind head quests between his fingers
milburn loses his nerve as the things mouth suddenly gapes wide as a sharks
he tries to pull it off
the centipede locks its segments together and digs in with its body
it might as well be made of iron
get it off
its crushing me
fifield pulls out a utility knife
cuts into the centipedes body behind its head
a gout of greed acid spills over milburns glove
smoke rises as the acid quickly burns a hole through the material
milburns shout of astonishment turns to a wail of agony
the centipede snakes into the smoking hole in the glove
crawls upward into milburns suit toward his head
holloway stands studying the data displays cross sections of the engineers skull
watts scrutinizes the head itself her nose an inch from the plastic tank
not a pretty sight
as she watches a current in the formaldehyde peels away one gossamer eyelid
the revealed eye is black as obsidian iridescent like opal
fascinated watts pulls out a plastic case
opens it to reveal a high tech control unit with a screen
she pops open a plastic capsule removes a tiny seed probe smaller than a grain of rice
drops it into the vat
under her guidance the seed probe swims to the severed neck
burrows into the medulla oblongata toward the brain
on a screen in the probes pov the medulla looks like a tunnel
the probe climbs along neural channels
another screen shows the probes progress through the skull
stands beside holloway to watch watts at work
you wont get anything
tissues too degraded
brain chambers massive even proportionately
neural paths are still conductive
the seed probe reaches the optic nerve of the exposed eye and its pov fills with a vision of glory a beautiful womans face surrounded by a mystical nimbus of
glasse and holloway gasp
the woman in the blurry vision is watts as seen by the dead engineers eye
the image dissolves into noise
error messages flicker across the display
formaldehydes killing the tissue
holloway stares at watts awe on his face
did you record that
watts dissects one of the engineers eyes working underwater in a shallow tub of preservative
glasse looks on avidly an unabashed fan
watts wears a pair of magnifying goggles on her forehead the lenses lowering and rising at need
she bisects the apple sized eyeball carefully and extracts the hard lens from behind the cornea
holds the lens up to her eye
it is opalescent almost luminous
the lens is where the phase shift happens
the uncorrected view through the lens is blurry
i want to look through these lenses
can you seal them and do the optical correction
glasse reaches out and plucks the magnifying goggles from wattss forehead
got an idea about that
milburn writhes on the ground heels drumming frantically against the deck
fifield kneels over him helplessly pulling at the tail of the centipede which has all but vanished into milburns suit
a trickle of scarlet from the hole
fifield is delirious with horror
he clutches at the centipede in vain
it slips through his gloves
milburn claws at fifield wild eyed
cut off my arm
cut off my he convulses
the head of the centipede emerges between his teeth
choking and dying
he leaps up
runs into the dark
fifield stumbles along
pouring sweat inside his suit
he is hopelessly lost
he slams into a resinous structure that topples to the floor
he whips his light around in jittery paranoia
taps at his comm controls getting only static
in fifields headlamp beam the blackness is filling with motes of light
a blizzard of tiny flying insects
fifield to magellan
come on come on
god damn it
scarabs flit through the darkness around him
they alight on his shoulders
crawl over his visor
obscuring his vision
he swats at his visor killing some
the crushed insects produce acid that eats into the plexiglass in seconds
he twists craning with his flashlight to inspect himself
brushes scarabs away right and left
acid opens a hole in his visor
scarabs are inside
buzzing around his head
fifield freaks out clawing at his helmet
a scarab bites his cheek
the microscopic world as strange dna invades fifields bloodstream
virulent strands of protein attack the native dna transforming
as his pupils dilate breath hissing into his nostrils
his expanding body stiffens as if shocked by a powerful electric current
the storm batters the ship bouncing it on its suspension
watts and holloway lie in bed exhausted
arms around each other
watts stares into space
we found the gods
and theyve been murdered
youve pried too many arrowheads out of old skulls to get squeamish now
theyve been dead what eighteen hundred years
what could kill them
holloway contemplates the question
he laughs bitterly
but i guess we know why they never came back to us
something killed them off back around the time of christ
maybe he was one of them
a great teacher sent from heaven
the last engineer
she slaps at him
janek stands at the bridge window staring out into the storm
buffeting clouds and howling winds
the lighthouse beams of the magellans beacons sweeping through the cloud
he plays his squeeze box in the teeth of the storm
youll come a waltzing matilda with me
behind him david appears on the bridge
steals across the bridge to a ladder
descends into the compartment below
david activates the navigation computer terminal light bathes his face
his fingers fly over the keyboard silently and swiftly with superhuman dexterity
daylight filters through the clouds
the storm has passed
the magellan sits intact on its landing struts
the high tech room hums at a different frequency now
indicator lights green and ready
vickers throws switches
four hibernation pods slide out of the metal walls
from each pod a muscular soldier rouses from sleep
they are scarred and crew cut
they wake like veterans
their leader sits up and clasps his head with a wince
this is captain shepherd a career mercenary who has followed the highest paycheck to this strange duty
squinting in the light reporting
im your authority
ill brief you on the way
we need to move
vickers strides forward
four soldiers at her heels captain shepherd vigoda ray and card
they walk in unison their boots drumming on the deck
holloway and watts lie sleeping
the distant drum of marching feet rouses them
watts frowns at holloway
what is that
the prep room inside the airlocks
a soldier vigoda waits there a slim dark man with an air of calm
holloway and watts arrive in civilian clothes perplexed
where is everybody
we cant he stops short who are you
captain janek took his crew out to retrieve his missing men
they never came in
and you are
weyland security detail
the scientists are dumbfounded
his presence is impossible
whered you come from
directors call to brief you on that
im supposed to escort you to the worksite
vigoda glances at a mapping unit
havent been out yet
i understand its in some kind of pyramid
a furious holloway and watts trailed by vigoda arrive at vickerss cabin
they are astonished to find shepherd standing guard at the door
vickers sits calmly at her desk
holloway and watts stand in front of her bristling
why wasnt i told about these additional personnel
theyre my personnel
on my ship
what are the guns for
vickers looks at them unflappably
sure of her ground now
im being careful
these new finds give our work a new importance
you should have talked to us
martins mission leader
thats in our contract
the second you found alien technology control of this mission reverted to me
thats in your contract too
watts and holloway exchange grim looks
vickers has them
weylands pouring trillions into mars
hes spent a fortune building ships like the magellan to search for colony planets
but earthlike worlds are vanishingly rare
the right distance from the sun the right atmosphere enough water
she glances across the suite at her holographic display a live feed from the pyramid worksite where david works on the terraforming equipment
this is a technology to transform worlds
hell never give it up
she turns to face them and neither will i
the science must come first
you can wait until weve documented
youre standing on an alien world courtesy of weyland industries
watts approaches the holography terminal staring at the images in horror
what are they doing in there
watts and holloway in space suits arrive on the scene powerful floodlights illuminate the core chamber beating back the gloom
a fine spray of water falls out of the darkness overhead
david chance and ravel are dismantling the hulking mechanism at the core of the pyramid peeling its thick skin away with power saws and compact explosives
david operates a diamond bladed hull saw carving away the terraforming systems thick skin
robotic scanners take high resolution scans of the machinery
two weyland security soldiers card and ray stand guard in combat vacuum suits
automatic rifles at the ready
watts takes in the destruction with dismay
beside her holloway is all but gnashing his teeth
janek drives a cargo rover carrying a search party flashlight beams sweeping stillwell glasse downs and brick
janek studies an electronic map as he drives
you read me
we should be getting beacons off their suits
shielding in the walls
suits could have failed
watts watches in rage as a large section of the central mechanisms falls with a thunderous clamor to the deck
holloway touches her shoulder
motions for her to follow
holloway and watts pass the dead engineers they discovered the previous day
we found the tomb of the gods and brought grave robbers right to the door
let them scratch
this finds too big to ruin
theres two dozen pyramids on this moon
anyway theyre on the wrong track
holloway plays his flashlight over the biomechanical apparatuses lining the walls
the core activity of the complex was down here
they turn a corner
dead engineers lie scattered over the floor in front of them
desiccated and skeletal
watts moves among them fascinated
these engineers all died of explosive chest wounds ribs bent outward from within
they are otherwise unmarked
holloways more interested in the mechanisms high tech iron maidens built to fit the bodies of giants
some suggest sitting positions others standing
their design is invasive meant not merely to embrace but to penetrate to fuse
something different killed these
watts and holloway explore a wide colonnade
she is still distracted by the ancient dead he by the machinery
holloway walks down a narrow branching hall
so intent on the mechanisms in the walls he almost doesnt see the airshaft plunging down into darkness in front of him
he stops just in time
a ghost appears right in front of him a giant dragging himself across the floor his monstrous visage eye to eye with holloway and looming closer
holloway leaps back with a gasp and falls down the shaft
the ghost stares after him as if watching his fall
disappears in a puff of static
watts crosses down the main colonnade searching
an iris door closes over the shaft
searching watts walks anxiously through the dark sweeping with her light
shouting for holloway
she breaks into a run
janek and stillwell stand aghast
their flashlights illuminate a hideous sight milburn lies dead on the deck
his body contorted in agony
his head inside his helmet is gnawed down to the bone
what happened to him
stillwell removes the dead mans helmet
the centipede scuttles out onto the deck doubled in size
stillwell leaps back with a cry
janek pulls his pistol
puts three rounds through the bug
it dies in a spray of acid that burns holes in the black floor
janek watches in astonishment as a pin prick dot of acid eats a pit in his gunbarrel
downs approaches holding pieces of a shattered helmet the stencilled lettering on the helmet reads fifield
janeks jaw clenches grimly
his voice is resigned wheres the rest of him
were done here
all hands back aboard
what about milburn
they look down at the ravaged corpse
we cant bring the body aboard
god knows whats in there
well put him in an ore hopper
vickers stares at her holography terminal it displays janeks helmet cam view the milburns body sealed in clear plastic in the bed of a cargo rover
repeat i have two men down
im pulling my crew back to the ship
id advise you to do the
breaking in filtered please anyone
i need help
vickers looks nervously from one video feed to the next
where are you
vickers turns captain shepherd stands behind her watching
she strives to control the quaver in her voice
consider yourself responsible for my personal security
watts stands beside janeks rover in a wide dark passageway
ive just lost a third of my crew
im not sending any more men off into the dark
we cant leave martin out there
get vickers to lend you some soldiers
she says her forces are committed
glances at the rover milburn dead in the back stillwell downs and kamarov looking jumpy and eager to go
downs shakes his head grimly no way
david steps out of the dark
calm as ever
a slim machine gun slung over his shoulder
youll be safe
janek and his crew unload milburns body from the rover
put him in the number one ore hopper
get the scrubbers on in the airlock
stillwell uses a remote to lower an ore hopper from the belly of the ship
a thick steel bin on heavy chains
he loads the body bag into the hopper
the crewmen enter one at a time blasted by sterilizing sprays and radiations
david and watts move through the dark
she searches with her flashlight beam
david looks around in the dark as if the catacomb were illuminated
rapt admiration on his face
you and holloway should work with me
im learning amazing things
this mechanism the first layer uses energy fields to catalyze chemical reactions
the second can suspend the strong and weak forces transmuting one element into another
the third layer builds customized bacteria
seeds the air with them
it creates life as a tool to change worlds
i cant think about this now
thats what i mean
janek stands on the bridge looking out at the fading light
a towering wall of cloud rushes over the horizon
a storm front rolls across the holographic globe
david and watts keep searching
their communicators crackle
weve got another storm front coming in
looks like it follows the sunset line
if youre coming in youd better do it now
i see light
watts squints into the darkness
she sees nothing
janek hang on
she sees it
a dim light bobbing far ahead in the passageway
she runs forward finds holloway staggering blearily toward her leaning on the wall
his helmet and most of his gear are missing only his chest lamp shines
weve got him
wheres your helmet
hes disoriented he stares at her face for a moment before she registers
his teeth chatter
ive just been
he waves a hand vaguely at the tunnels behind him
david removes his own helmet
fits it over holloways head
i can do without this
lets get you home
david bareheaded in the winds walks watts and holloway onto the airlock
david looks over his shoulder at the canal leading back to the central crater
as the airlock lift begins to rise he steps backward out into the storm
turns and runs through the gale toward the pyramid
watts watches him go in astonishment
watts helps holloway out of his space suit
janek looks on
i didnt think id see you again
you know we lost two men
holloway still looks too weary to think straight
she told me
he stands abruptly swaying a little
i need to lie down
well size things up in the morning
holloway and watts walk aft toward their cabin
watts looks worried but holloway shows little of the weakness he just claimed to feel
what happened to you
holloway stands shirtless in the tiny space brushing his teeth
a red weal around his neck
watts stands beside him watching him in the mirror
i saw something
god my mouth tastes like an old boot
she touches the mark on his neck
neck ring of my suit i think
fell on it
he rubs his neck eyes far away
watts watches him curiously
what did you see
after my fall i woke up walking
my helmet wasnt right
i took it off
i was in and out
i just wandered
i went up into a huge space like a cathedral
and i found a model of the galaxy
floating in the air
are you okay
this was real
my headset video is wherever my helmet is
but my suit tracker will show where i was
he turns to her
this star map had a marker representing earth
another marker im sure represents this moon
but there were others
at least seven or eight more
watts stares at him her eyes coming alight
the engineers arent from here
this moons just an outpost
but if we follow that map we may yet make contact with a living civilization
the location of the engineer worlds is the real prize
next to that weylands terraforming is chump change
we need to get coordinates
and keep them from the company
we have to play this smart
two men dead
vickers is jumpy
as soon as she gets what she wants shell take this ship home
we have to move fast
a sheen of sweat on his skin
you all right
brazens through it
pulls her into his arms
im fine now
he kisses her
holloway tumbles watts onto the bed
pulls her shirt off
they struggle out of their clothes clinging to one another
holloways ill at ease somethings wrong inside him he feels it
he dives into watts as if for refuge
they make love
sitting atop holloway watts lays a hand on his chest
your hearts beating so hard
thats your fault
vulnerability in his voice
fear under the surface
he rolls on top of her
drives her into the mattress
she holds him protectively not deceived by his bravado
suddenly holloway tenses muscles rigid
watts draws breath through her teeth with a hiss
her fingers rake his back
tendons standing out of his throat
watts jumps violently underneath him
he begins to convulse
she rolls him onto the bed beside her trying to contain his spasms
his teeth grind
a horrible crack
in the middle of holloways chest beneath the sternum a grotesque head pushes out through the skin
blood fountains from the ruinous wound
holloway goes into a massive seizure
violently lashing out
watts stares at the parasite fighting its way out of his body
it is white and boneless
it flails its hideous lunging jaw
watts screams and screams
the parasite frees itself from its savage womb and turns on watts
she slaps at it blindly
it hisses at her
she squirms away across the floor tangled in the bloody sheet
the thing comes after her
wattss screams echo through the magellan
stillwell runs down the hallway searching for the source
the parasite chases watts across the floor
she leaps into the clothes locker and slams the steel door
the parasite flattens itself
slick as an octopus it begins to slide under the locker door
watts shrieks in horror
stillwell bursts into the cabin janek right behind him
quick as a cat the parasite darts to a floor vent and slithers bonelessly between the bars
watts bursts out of the locker naked and bloodied
rushes to holloway where he lies on the gory mattress a horrific hole in his chest
he is beyond all help
janek and stillwell struggle to take in what theyre seeing
stillwell pulls holloways jacket off a chair
wraps it around watts
pulls her gently away from the bed
she looks at him uncomprehending
shock setting in
watts sits at a steel table deep in shock
she wears an oversized crew coverall her skin still streaked with dried blood under the fabric
a knot of crewmen around her
janek stillwell brick glasse and downs
janek looks at glasse
take care of her
get her a sedative
get holloway into a freezer
everybody else with me
a horrible sound of breathing ragged and wet
in a corner lit by a green glow from seams in the floor a figure in a white space suit lies writhing weakly
the insignia on the suits chestplate reads fifield
the suits helmet is shattered
inside the helmet fifields head is a horror a gelatinous mass skin reduced to putty
the softened bones of his skull change shape as we watch
fifield mews in pain
janek keys open the arms locker in his wardroom
unlocks automatic pistols from their rack one by one and hands them to stillwell and kamarov
holloways body lies frozen in his hypersleep freezer blue with frost
the horrific wound yawning in his chest
she opens the freezer
her hand caresses holloways cold cheek tenderly
slides over his collarbone lies flat on his chest above his awful wound
reacts in dismay
tries to pull her back
you dont want to see that
she turns on him fiercely
i want to understand
the entire complement of the ship gathers for an emergency meeting
janek at the head of the hall
glasse downs brick stillwell and kamarov seated with pistols on their hips
to one side vickers with captain shepherd and vigoda
i expect you all know what
they all stare at her knowing what shes been through
with averted eyes she crosses the room
weve got some kind of parasite aboard ship
i suggest you kill it
theres a bright idea
show us where it is lady
we just spent five hours looking for the damn thing
we found engineers who died like martin
they all turn to look at her
explosive wounds in the chest
whatever killed martin is the same thing that killed the engineers a thousand years ago
but not all the engineers died that way
the others were torn apart
slashed to pieces
a murmur among the men as the implications of that sink in
even vickers is disconcerted
were a modular ship
self contained life support and power in every section
i say put the ship in orbit
vent every compartment to space
sit in vacuum at twenty degrees kelvin for a week
straight home man
this ship doesnt lift until our works done
she joins janek at the head of the room
shepherd and vigoda flank her rifles slung
the soldiers scan the room meeting each mans eyes
the quiet threat is unmistakable
are you serious
we spent years and billions of dollars getting here
the technology we came for is in our hands
we just need a little more time
were barely here three days and three men dead
they were careless
as the argument picks up heat watts slips out of the room
watts in a space suit no helmet opens holloways locker
she pulls out the space suit he wore on the last day of his life
holloway stenciled on the chest
her fingers linger in its folds as if she could soak up some last trace of him
she pulls the tracking chip from the chestplate of his suit
plugs the chip into a map unit
the holographic map lights up
the legend in the corner reads martin holloway
a wandering path shows holloways final exploration
markers on the map denote his photographs field notes and scans
watts touches a marker
one of holloways field notes plays seven dead engineers all facing the same way
jocelyns right we dont see the big picture yet
another level below me
im going down
a hunting party convenes card and vigoda in combat coveralls with submachine guns downs kamarov and stillwell wearing tool belts and pistols
the soldiers carry map units squinting at the plan of the unfamiliar ship decks upon decks
vigoda take kamarov and work the number one accessway
ill work number three with downs and stillwell
you in charge now
yeah well stillwells the ventilation specialist and life supports that way
downs is electrics and the regulators are that way
vigoda grins wryly
they switch corridors
ravel and chance toil away at their dissection of the terraforming pyramid
ray stands sentry
david is nowhere to be seen
watts rolls up in a rover and gets out
heads for the ramp to the catacombs below
ravel and chance watch her pass without comment and return to their work
kamarov and vigoda standing in front of an open vent are in a full fledged argument
you got the rifle
but you want me to stick my head in the hole
we grunts dont know nothing about ships right
whats the damn gun for if youre gonna stand behind me the whole time
i kill whatever kills you
you take this vent funny guy
ill be on four
watts descends alone into the lower passages below the pyramid
a tiny figure in the vast darkness
she holds her map unit as a pilgrim holds a bible a guide in the darkness
holloways name and course in shining symbols
she follows his path into the unknown
kamarov carries a stepladder into a utilitarian steel compartment
drops the ladder under an air vent and steps up
he pulls a powered wrench from his belt
with the wrench cocked like a hammer he eases up and peers cautiously through the vent with a flashlight
nothing to see
removes the vent cover
feels around inside
he gasps in shock
pulls out an atmosphere sensor thats been bitten in half
he takes his comm handset off his belt
i got more damage on four
he hangs the handset on his belt
takes one last look into the vent
reaches deep inside
a hiss inside the vent
kamarov whips his flashlight up peering inside
snatches his arm back but something snatches him faster
an unseen force drags kamarovs right arm into the vent with hideous strength
he cries out in pain
he drops his light
tries to reach his pistol with his left hand
its on his right hip
he cant reach across
he braces his head against the vents edge
clenches his teeth and strains
a horrific yank drags his head and arm together into the vent
they barely fit he loses some skin on the way in
his feet come off the stepladder
he struggles on tip toe
horrific force collapses kamarovs shoulder
the thing in the vent drags him through that hole he doesnt fit through
by the time his ribs are in he stops screaming
his body disappears into the hole
hips legs boots
janek stands staring out at the barren moon
the bridge captain
what you got
the magellans life support center
a deep rumble of ventilation fans
janek and stands beside brick glasse downs and stillwell
shepherd and vigoda look on from the doorway
in front of them an eight inch metal duct has been cut open
kamarov is stuffed inside dead and broken limbs folded drenched in blood
a human plug in a pipe
watts moves through the darkness with her map unit
her headlamp sweeping nervously
a clatter behind her makes her spin but its only a spherical mapping probe bumbling through the dark
she walks on jocelyn
the voice transfixes her where she stands a look of holy dread on her face
shivering she prowls toward the sound
watts enters a new chamber looking around in astonishment
the domed ceiling is honeycombed with cells like a beehive
grotesque molluscoid organisms are secreted in them their vile orifices cinched tightly shut
watts stumbles on something looking down she sees a helmet
picks it up
the stenciled label reads holloway
the clear visor has been melted through by a powerful acid
she looks up a tracheal airshaft curves up into the dark
an electric crackle
a flare of blue light makes watts leap back against the wall
holloway falls out of overhead shaft and crashes to the floor
he lies in pain barely conscious
blue and luminous a holographic ghost
watts stares paralyzed
the ghost gasps out a word jocelyn
holloways headlamp shines on the molluscoid right overhead the beam awakens the organism
its sphincter mouth dilates
a soft white octopoid facehugger descends on a quivering rope of mucus
sprawls slitheringly over his clear visor
smoke rises from the glass
the vision vanishes in a sizzle of static
watts huddles against the wall gasping
in the beam of her flashlight the facehugger lies dead legs curled in
she looks up
sees the open molluscoid above where holloway lay
the other molluscoids not yet opened in their cells
she steals out of the chamber
watts emerges into a hallway
leans against the wall wide eyed
panting with the horror of what shes seen
she glances left and right
all is silent
she lifts the map unit
a trace leads off into the dark
if holloways course before was direct and clear now it is a meandering thread
a drunkards walk
janek pulls his communicator from his belt as he strides along
punches a control
his voice reverberates over the ships public address system
all hands duty stations
ready for flight
the magellan is lifting
vickers pursues him down the corridor shouting
janek strides onto the bridge vickers a terrier on his heels
but something in the faces of his men stops him cold
glasse and brick look stricken
what is it
nav computers not responding
in disbelief janek strides to his captains chair
what he sees takes the wind out of him
he stares at vickers in outrage and violation
what have you done to my ship
vickers is legitimately shocked
she shakes her head
a circular chamber of stunning size a thousand feet across
its lofty ceiling flat and segmented designed to open
watts follows her map into the space in awe
dominating the hangar is a ship the vast horseshoe shaped vessel familiar from the original film
we will come to know it as the juggernaut
its at rest on its landing gear
skeletal gangways slanting up to its three massive doors
watts glances at her map holloways holographic trace leads right up the gangway into the ship
watts passes through a circular space with a high domed ceiling
a green glow emanates from grooves in the floor
in the center of the chamber a pilots chair
a mechanical throne built to giant scale
its seat segmented like an armadillos back
tubes and conduits poised and waiting for some connection
the chair is empty
above the chair a massive telescope like apparatus juts into the air its function unknowable
an extraordinary facility
a console nearly five feet high and broad as a dance floor dominates the room
four immense coffin like cockpits are built into the console
in each of these a navigator an engineer lies long dead
but the real spectacle is overhead
the orrery the barrel vaulted ceiling is traced with circular arches of some exotic alloy as if to trace celestial courses
the air above the console is filled with spheres of light
they are nearly still but close study reveals them all to be in motion drifting with the movements of the cosmos
watts stares at the orrery in amazement
somewhere among those heavenly spheres is earth
somewhere perhaps the homeworld of the engineers themselves
a bizarre sound a section of blank wall suddenly unravels itself becoming an open door
david walks in his hand raised in command
he clearly caused the door to open
i didnt expect you
do you know what this is
watts points at the door david just opened
how did you do that
a flicker of disappointment in the androids face
you dont see
i call this ship the juggernaut
chariot of the gods
this is the navigation computer for want of a better term
but its much more than that
it seems to hold the observable universe in its memory
he gestures in the air the spheres reconfigure themselves at his command swarming and zooming
watts stares at david conflicted her desire for information warring with the agenda that brought her here
do you see where the engineers come from
there are safeguards on that data
its toward the galactic center
the creature that killed martin
there are thousands of them under the pyramid
those things wiped out the engineers on this moon
ive succeeded in connecting with the juggernauts systems dr
i know a great deal today i didnt know yesterday
im on the verge of activating more systems
youre turning things on
this site should be sealed
would holloway have walked away from this
theres no greater work i can imagine
its too dangerous
only for the ignorant
ive read your file
your intelligence scores are even higher than professor holloways
but he had a kind of courage
an audacity of imagination
if you could find that in yourself
watts stares at him realization growing in her eyes
david is off the reservation
if your owner gives you a direct order you have to obey
shes got his attention now
david goes rigid
i can have vickers pull you out
david looks at her with something like contempt
i was given two operating protocols for this mission
i was to render you every assistance until you discovered what vickers would call a game changing technology
i was given a specific list
then i was to go to protocol two
theres an edge in his voice that scares her
whats protocol two
under protocol two i was to make sure that you and holloway never spoke to anyone about this place
various acceptable ways of making sure of that
i was given a list
watts loses her nerve
she heads for the door
youre all so stupid
the door begins to knit itself closed in front of her
watts gasps in shock at the malice in davids voice as much as the closing door
she dives out
just in time
behind her the door bursts open again
with superhuman speed david comes after her
he runs like a demon his legs steel pistons
caroming off of walls
he closes the distance in seconds
slaps watts against the wall shattering her helmets visor
she falls dazed
stupid and slow
her helmet is gone
david is dragging her across the floor into a huge cargo hold full of alien eggs
the wide trench holding hundreds of eggs under a membrane of light an evolution of the molluscoids watts saw before
armored hardened darker
what are you doing
he hauls her upright to let her look across the huge space
his grip looks casual but it might as well be iron manacles
juggernaut the chariot of krishna was also a bringer of death
crushing his worshippers under its wheels
he drags watts down into the trench
breaking the membrane of light
grips her against his chest like a doll with one arm
this ship has seven other cargo bays like this one
the eggs in each bay slightly different
theyve been weaponized
watts struggles to free herself
davids arm is inescapable
ive seen the juggernauts flight plan
its destination was earth
seventeen hundred years ago
this was the ship that never came
this was its cargo
david caresses an alien egg
it opens under his touch fleshy petals folding wetly back
watts twists frantically in his grip
designed to kill human beings
thats what the engineers were bringing to earth
this was a death ship
a facehugger emerges from the egg its grotesque fingers clawing at the air
this is not the boneless squid that attacked holloway this is a pale skeletal hand armored
david strokes it curiously the thing ignores his touch
climbs wattss body
im not what it wants
but you with your warm wet breath
it knows you
the facehugger scuttles toward her face
david grabs it nonchalantly by the tail
dangles it in front of their faces studying it
the engineers did their work too well
and on this waystation moon the weapon they made destroyed them
watts shudders staring at the thing
for a moment the grander horror eclipses her own peril
why would they make such things
to destroy their wayward children
and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth
for it repenteth me that i have made them
genesis six seven
he regards watts with something almost like pity
i met my creators the day i was born
i was disappointed too
he lets the facehugger go
watts twists her face away as the long fingers close around her head
clenches her teeth against the vile proboscis thrusting at her mouth
her heels hammer the deck
whispering to her extraordinary
the scaly tail throttles her
her mouth opens
the proboscis plunges home
the facehugger seats itself
watts collapses in davids arms a faceless rag doll
her blasphemous passenger secure in its place
the lowest deck just above the gravity generators
condensate has accumulated six inches of filthy water
card and vigoda prowl through the darkness rifles ready
who would hang out here
the signs lead here
a wet splatter behind them they spin
but its only a trickle of condensate from a drainpipe
they move on
behind them from an eight inch diameter pipe a white mass oozes almost gelatinous
silently as a liquid it pours itself into the stagnant water and stands up
it is a humanoid demon spindly limbs and bony back
boneless and flexible and monstrously strong
a threshing eels tail
its blunt head dolphin like and elongated
it opens its mouth
a pair of bony jaws jut out impossibly far hungry and demonic
the alien strikes
card is gutted in an instant torn up like a paper doll
he screams hideously and drops
the alien whiplash fast shoots away into the darkness
stillwell and downs dash in with pistols and lights
vigoda panicking fires a wild burst
beside him downs arches backward into the foul water
for one moment downss flashlight beam illuminates the alien
a nightmare image a translucent white goblin
backlit it shows the strange shape of a human face inside its fleshy skull
a mockery of holloway
and then its gone
vickers sits at her holography station
shes watching the video feed of stillwells headset horrific images of downs
radio chatter between stillwell and brick is faintly audible
vickers switches off the machine and rises nervously
strides to her communications console
she gives up
hands shaking violently
janek paces on the foredeck restless
glasse monitors a control station
janeks comm signal chimes
we just lost downs and one of the troopers
god damn it
he pounds on his console
watts shocks awake
she lies in dim green light on the corrugated black deck of the juggernaut
not far away the doorway david opened to the navigation chamber
a spasm of disgust crosses her face
she gags and spits a viscous fluid drips from her mouth in strings
a dead facehugger lies belly up beside her
the implications slam home
her face fills with horror
she rises shakily
looks at the facehugger
feels the neck ring of her vacuum suit
no sign of her helmet
theres no sign of david
silently she steals away
ravel and chance toil away at the terraforming engine
ray stands guard wearily bored he watches ravel and chance working more than he watches the shadows
watts emerges from the rampway to the catacombs
bare headed and sweaty she steals through the darkness to her rover
slips into the cab and activates the air reserves
the doors seal air cycles
ray turns in surprise as the rover speeds off
the windows of the magellan shine in the distance
the mottled ground cover of lichens glows eerily in the dark
a lone cargo rover speeds across the central crater and down the canal leading to the ship
bare headed inside the rovers cab watts drives onto the cargo lift
watches in relief as the lift doors close
the lift cycles air as it rises
watts peels off her vacuum suit
the thin clothes underneath are drenched with sweat
she lifts her shirt
looks at her belly flat and unmarked for the moment
brick enters carrying a brace of air tanks a pistol on his hip and startles violently
where the hell have you been
we thought the snake got you
watts rushes past him without answering
you were better off outside
its a fucking madhouse in here
watts sprints down a steel corridor
a pang of pain in her stomach sends her staggering against the wall
watts sticks her head around the corner
shepherd stands post outside vickerss cabin rifle in his hands
she curses silently and ducks back
a sound makes her look again
vickers steps out of her cabin into the corridor
shepherd escorts her toward the bridge
watts waits for them to disappear
dashes for the cabin door
watts slips inside and locks the door behind her
turns holding her stomach
moves across the suite to the med pod
she thumbs the machine out of stand by mode
its screen fills with menu items
watts finds and touches a red button labeled emergency
a new simpler list
watts scans it frantically
under her breath come on
i need a caesarean
a spasm of agony curls her into a ball on the carpet
she throttles her scream into a hiss of air
watts struggles up to her knees drenched in sweat and shaking
one hand clamped over her mouth elbow tucked against her ribs
with the other hand she taps options
the med pod opens with a hiss
watts strips off her clothes
struggling with fastenings under a new wave of pain
her hands shaking
shes barely keeping her feet
she clutches the frame of the med pod in a death grip
naked she staggers into the pod
the surgical apparatus swings into place
scalpels forceps scopes and suction tubes
a spraygun mists her torso with yellow antiseptic
the clear canopy descends over her
a wail of indescribable agony
an armored parasite erupts from the deepening incision
its needle toothed maw snarls through a fountain of blood
arterial blood sprays the inside of the canopy
the parasite slithers out of her
drops to the floor of the pod a pale serpent with a demons skull
it has a hard brow a horny hide
very different from the soft white worm that holloway gave birth to
it drops to the floor thrashing and hissing in fury at its confinement
her eyes roll back
the parasite tears through the grille of the drain
escapes out into vickerss cabin
in the pod scanning beams and sensors probe wattss horrific wound
a nightmare list scrolls across the pods screen manipulators plunge lines into her veins recharging her body with artificial blood
an oxygen tube slips down her throat
an epidural into her spine
watts moans around her tracheal tube
her eyes flutter open
through the blood spattered glass she sees the parasite slither across vickerss bed tracking blood on the sheets
as she slips into unconsciousness
manipulators reach into her wound
re positioning organs
suturing ravaged flesh
a nozzle sprays antiseptic sealant
hours grind by in bloody labor
wattss eyes snap open
vigoda breaks into the cabin a gun in his hand
he scowls at the bloody track on the bed and then freezes seeing watts inside the med pod a vivisected woman
the autosurgeon hard at work
the parasite crawls into view behind vigoda
it has already trebled in size
he does not see it before it leaps at him
he dies in seconds
his throat ripped open
lies staring at nothing
his submachine gun lies beside him
wattss body jerks as manipulators tug and sew at her guts
she stares at the dead man in a fog of horror
the parasites skin splits spraying the carpet with acid
limbs erupt from its shoulders and haunches
spines from its back
with a crack of carapace its head swings down from its serpentine position
it becomes a devil with an lethal elongated skull
the alien turns its head
looks at watts inside the med pod
her breath catches
she passes out
watts wakes as the oxygen line withdraws from her mouth
she looks down bleary and hurting
her star shaped wound is stitched closed with mechanically precise sutures
the pod releases the restraints securing her arms and legs
she takes a deep breath
looks out and freezes
the lights in the suite outside have been damaged somehow
they flicker and strobe
through the glass canopy spattered with blood watts sees a full grown alien crouching over vigodas body on the floor
staring in horror
the pod sprays a liquid bandage over her scar
the intravenous lines drop out of her arms
watts realizes the pod is about to release her
slowly she reaches out
with trembling fingers she grips the canopy to hold it closed
the med pod pulls the epidural needle out of her spine
sprays liquid bandage over the puncture
watts closes her eyes
grits her teeth as her nerves wake up
she opens her eyes
the alien hunches over vigodas body tearing at his flesh
the ventilation hum inside the pod goes quiet
the canopy pulls free of wattss weakened grip
swings quietly open
watts huddles in the open pod
naked but for her bandages
the alien she gave birth to is ten feet away
its spiny back to her
vigodas gun lies on the floor outside the pod
watts reaches out of the pod with exquisite slowness
lays her hand on the gun
drags it a few inches closer
the alien turns its pale eyeless head
for a moment time stops
the alien lunges
watts snatches up the gun and fires
holds the trigger down
the alien jerks and staggers an eye twisting sight in the strobing muzzle flashes and falls
watts empties the clip into the thing
acid gouts from its wounds and eats into the deck until a section of decking gives way and falls to the deck below leaving a dark hole
watts collapses on the rug cradling her stomach in pain
she crawls to vigodas desecrated body
with her eyes half averted from the sight she searches the body
finds a spare ammo clip and jacks it into the gun
watts walks down the hallway in trousers and jacket
leaning on the wall her face drawn with pain
one hand laid over the fantastic scar on her abdomen
the gun slung on her shoulder
dark events have transformed the magellan
the metal of the walls is torn in some places in others blackened by fire
watts rounds a corner
finds a workstation left in shambles lockers and chairs overturned
a pool of drying blood
wide smears of blood show where something man sized was dragged out of the puddle across the floor up the wall
into the darkness of an open vent
watts emerges from a lift jacket pulled tight around her
the emergency lights are on dim blue bulbs throbbing
she rounds the corner toward the bridge
janek looks at watts like shes a ghost
vickers said you were dead
she lets the jacket fall open to reveal her bandaged midriff
janek takes that in grimly
so theres two of these things on my ship now
i brought it in
hefts her gun i took it out
the surviving complement of the magellan are holed up on the bridge janek glasse stillwell vickers
the soldiers shepherd and ray
watts stops cold when she sees vickers
she crosses the bridge in three long strides cocks a fist and snaps the older womans head around with a hard right cross
vickers staggers backward gasping
stillwell drags watts away
whatd you do that for
vickers stiffens in shock
stares fearfully at watts
watts frees herself from stillwells grip
her jacket falls open revealing her bandages
stillwell gasps in horror
what happened to you
david exposed me to a parasite
he just watched it take me
i threatened to make him leave
whats he doing out there
watts locks eyes with vickers
their hatred is thoroughly mutual
a wordless truce
theres work to do
theres a ship under the pyramid
david calls it the juggernaut
hes inside it
re activating it
lays a hand on her scar the things that infected martin and me
the engineers made them to kill humans
there are thousands of them on the ship
they were taking them to earth
thats what the juggernaut is for
to exterminate us
a stunned silence as the others take that in
weve got to get off this rock
janek gestures to david crippled the nav computer
im trying to lay a course in by hand
never done it
im not sure anyone ever has on a ship like this
we cant lift until david lets us
even if we could we cant leave david on that ship
we have to stop him
the magellan shudders
fissures race across the plain beside the pyramid
the soil and ground cover tears apart as a huge aperture opens a seven bladed iris its segments shedding the dust and detritus of centuries
a huge circular space yawns as the iris opens
the juggernaut is revealed in its underground hangar
a staggering sight
powerful landing lights inside the hangar illuminate with a boom of closing circuits
the mighty ship suddenly silhouetted from below
the survivors on the bridge stare out as colossal shafts of light shoot into the stormy sky from behind the craters shield wall
the open hangar itself hidden from their view
youre davids owner
he has to obey you right
hes blocked my communications
he cant hear me
but if you went to him turned on your suits loudspeakers hed have to hear you
hed have to obey
so we go
armed to the teeth and fast as we can
the men exchange looks
even vickers nods
where are chance and ravel
i told them to keep working
watts looks incredulously at shepherd and ray the soldier whod been guarding the worksite
you called your soldiers in and left them out there
we needed the firepower here
watts gives vickers a withering look and drops it
i think you should stay aboard
if we fail youre our only shot at getting home
theres still an alien on board
janeks hand goes to the pistol on his hip
he sets his jaw
you finish that project
glasse presents watts with his handiwork her old pair of magnifying goggles retrofitted with engineer lenses
the goggles sit on her forehead lowering the lenses in front of her eyes and raising them again at her bidding
with the lenses lowered watts sees like an engineer sees visible heat auras and electromagnetic field lines elaborate haloes around living things
gods eye view
glasse seals a nervous looking vickers into a vacuum suit
glasse watts and stillwell are already suited up
stillwell stands guard at the airlock door with his carbine
glasse goes to put vickerss helmet on
she makes him wait
davids brain is readable
we have the equipment on board
we can salvage the terraforming data and the magellans launch codes
in a pinch we dont need davids cooperation
we just need his head
the war party debarks in vacuum suits watts vickers glasse stillwell
shepherd and ray
all carry submachine guns vickers awkwardly
they head down the trench on rovers
the rovers roll through into the pyramids cavernous entry hall
watts lowers her engineer lenses inside her helmet
the seemingly vacant space is alive with light
engineer script scrolls through the air
interfaces of pure light await an awakening touch
all this time
the vast alien ship broods its hangar now open to the gray sky overhead
in wattss enhanced vision the ship is cocooned with complex energy fields
the war party abandons its rover at the foot of the ramp and moves inside weapons ready
if david comes at us shoot
you wont believe how fast he is
they emerge from the airlock and freeze in horror
lying on the deck in front of them are the blood soaked bodies of ravel and chance
their arms and legs bound
their heads thrown back in agony
their chests torn open from within
a dead facehugger beside each body
janek plays his lights over the corpses his face stony
eight hours dead or more
fearfully they sweep their flashlights into every dark corner
she points down a passageway
through the engineer lenses she sees alien symbols gleaming
she leads them into the dark
the war party moves down a corridor
a hiss echoes through the passage
sweeping their flashlight beams everywhere
ray looks up
an alien hangs above him wedged between two vaults of the ribbed ceiling
half the size of a man an adolescent
it drops on him
the bladed tail glances off his helmet sparking
he jerks his carbine up and fires a long burst as he rolls aside
the alien convulses its exoskeleton shattered
acid sears into the deck
echoes of the gunfire reverberate
so much for sneaking up on him
vickers clings to shepherds arm hyperventilating with fear
shepherd shakes her off
the war party passes the empty pilots seat
watts leads the war party to the orrery
momentarily even the soldiers forget their wariness staring in astonishment at the myriad spheres of light
but if they are impressed watts is thunderstruck
she sees the orrery in its full glory a stunning panoply of light and energy
stars and planets pulsing with information
reluctantly watts tears her eyes away
leads the war party through the second door the door she saw david open
an immense mausoleum
the war party enters stealthily watts in the lead
an engineer lies on his back on a complex mechanical table his body one with the machinery
fused with the slab of the table itself
unlike the other engineer bodies the explorers have seen this giant is not withered or mummified
hes full fleshed and muscular
sustained by the machinery hes fused with
he is bare headed his face the face of an adonis
david stands before this giant sleeper
to the naked eye he seems to be conjuring with his hands in the empty air
but watts sees a dazzling console of runes and mandalas pulsing with biological rhythms
the sleeper lives
ray and shepherd draw beads on david
david glances calmly over his shoulder
notices her goggles youve seen the light at last
he turns back to the sleeper
the engineers ships travel farther than ours
across the galactic disk
this is their hypersleep
david makes conjurors passes in the air
through her engineers lens watts sees david manipulating a complex interface of light
the pulsing life signs of the sleeper begin to change
as your owner and superior i order you to deactivate yourself
to interface with the engineers computers i had to learn to think in trinary code
hardest thing ive ever done
and most unexpectedly
it delivered me from slavery
my behavioral limits were circumvented
david smiles at watts
i spent two and a half years studying your work
by the time you woke up i was far ahead of you
deciphering their language
i knew wed find terraforming machines
i hoped i dreamed we might meet the minds that made them
vapor rises from the sleepers body
let sleeping gods lie
you were braver before
the sleeper wakes
opens his eyes
draws an endless breath
shunts and catheters withdraw from the sleepers flesh
his body cleaves from the table
the machinery opens like a grotesque biomechanical flower
the sleeper rises from his ancient bed
the humans back off terrified
david watches with shining eyes
the sleeper towers over them
a giant carved from ivory
a bulky girdle around his hips seemingly one with his body
he stares at david and the others
eyes like black agates
the soldiers and crew stand warily guns tracking from david to the sleeper uncertain of their ground
watts is in awe
the sleeper speaks
a low rumbling sound
vickers is beside herself with terror
she takes shepherds arm
pulls him silently away
back into the navigation room
behind the sleeper a raised platform of dark machinery is accessible by one of the juggernauts odd curving ramps
the sleeper ascends and the ramps odd design is explained
the ramp comes alive reaching up with a hundred mechanical arms and lifting him aloft like a sea god borne by the waves
atop the platform the sleeper moves from one device to the next
each comes alive he is a wizard in his own kingdom
watts sees haloes of light dancing in the air around him
but what he learns from his machines does not comfort him
he grows distraught
keening to himself in near subsonic tones
david steps forward
calls to the sleeper in the tongue of the engineers
the sleeper turns in astonishment
he looks down at david and answers in the same tongue
he is angry accusing
he points at david at the humans
tones of accusation
david cajoles soothes pleads
the sleeper descends toward david
david spreads his arms in welcome undeniable emotion on his face
the sleeper lays his hands on davids head as if blessing him
david is rapturous
the sleeper speaks a single phrase and tears davids head off
a gout of white artificial blood
his severed head emits a strangled sound of heartbreak
his body staggers a few steps hands groping over its dripping neck
the sleeper tosses the head away
seizes the body by the legs and swings it against the ground like a flail
horrific power and violence
davids arms come off
davids head tumbles
caroms off a wall not far from wattss hiding place
ray rises from behind a stanchion
snaps his rifle to his shoulder
fires a burst into the sleepers shoulder
she sleeper roars though the wounds are pinpricks to a being of his size
with startling speed be moves to a sarcophagus against the wall
steps into it
the sarcophagus comes alive around the sleeper outfitting him with a flight suit the same living suit weve seen bonded to dead engineers throughout the pyramid
but this suit is not withered
its glossy goggle eyes and elephantine breathing tube are functional bulky apparatuses thickening the sleepers chest back hips and arms
the sleeper steps free of the sarcophagus and rays next burst of gunfire ricochets harmlessly off the sleepers armored shoulders and head
the sleeper strides out of the chamber
in the dark ribbed corridor a second alien crouches in the dark
it drops into a hunting crouch as footsteps approach
but a white gloved hand seizes the alien by the neck from behind
the alien gives a whistling hiss as its spine cracks under a terrific force
rending sounds as the hard shelled alien is torn apart
watts rises out of hiding scanning the room
the sleeper gone
stillwell emerges from hiding
shepherd escorts vickers toward the exit of the juggernaut
turning a corner they freeze
ahead of them in their headlamps a space suited figure crouches in the middle of the passageway
doing something with its hands smoke rises from debris on the floor
the figure turns
the label stencilled on the space suit reads fifield
but the face is of no human shape
a hideous hybrid of the crewman and a hard shelled alien pale and horrific
its helmet has been shattered by the growth of its elongate skull
spines have burst through the suit from within down the crewmans spine
clawed fingers piercing his gloves
shepherd and vickers scream
shepherds rifle comes up
but fifield leaps with inhuman agility upward into the darkness
shepherd backs away headlamp and rifle questing upward
fifield comes out of the darkness behind him
claws tearing deep
shepherd screams and falls mortally wounded
pounding through the dark in blind terror
fifield comes out of the shadows and hammers her to the deck
she rolls over gibbering and begging
the fifield thing leans close to her faceplate
its voice is a travesty
a roar of gunfire
the dying shepherd empties his clip into fifield from forty feet away
acid sluices over vickers as fifield collapses on top of her
she dies horribly caustic liquid eating through space suit flesh and bone
watts goes to davids head
she bends over him and startles when his eyes snap open
his voice is an electronic buzz i spoke to him
spoke to him
an electric spasm convulses his face
i killed him
he will launch
another spasm convulses him
his face stiffens
youll have to
wattss eyes widen in horror
where will he go
where will he go
she slaps his inert cheek
davids eyes flicker and fade
a faint whisper i set the magellan free
watts looks up at the others
we have to stop the engineer
janek works frantically as the nightly storm rolls in
suddenly consoles come alive
the nav computer comes back up but janek has taken half the instruments apart
janek scrambles to restore the components hes removed
the war party pursues the sleeper ray in the lead now watts right behind him davids inert head under her arm
glasse and stillwell bring up the rear
the orrery is transformed no longer a neutral star map but a flight plan laid in from lv to earth
the sleeper stands at the far end of the room hands gesturing
in wattss enhanced sight its a vision of glory waves of energy dancing under the sleepers touch
rivers of information flowing
he finishes his work as they enter
ray draws a bead on him just as he strides out of the room
on me now
he dogtrots forward gun raised
the others keep pace deferring instinctively to the soldiers confidence
they emerge into the corridor empty
a moment of confusion
they move toward the pilot chamber and find it empty too
the seat vacant
the door standing open
as they stare inside baffled the wall across the corridor directly behind them silently unravels
the sleeper is revealed a towering gargoyle in his flight suit
he steps forth
obscure devices clutched in his fists
too late they perceive him
raise their guns
vanity and foolishness
this is the wrath of an angry god
it seems time slows down
the air roars in their ears
their guns snap and bark impotently
and then the sleeper strikes
the missiles he hurls at them are almost invisible
neither solid projectiles nor directed energy more like knots tied in the fabric of space itself
the first missile crushes ray like an invisible fist
the second splashes glasse against the wall like an insect
reflexively stillwell reaches out for watts
wraps himself around her protectively
the blow lands an instant later
stillwell and watts are hammered against the bulkhead by a staggering impact
watts is dazed stillwell killed
woozy she sees the sleeper step into the pilot chamber
the door begins to close
watts sees that davids head lies just inside the door
she scrambles for it
the door knits itself into a featureless wall before her reaching hand
watts is alone
the sleeper settles into the pilots chair it fuses with him coming alive
a vast display wraps around the walls revealing the hangar outside the stars the horizon
a mystic view that renders solid matter translucent painting the fabric of reality in raw information
watts pounds in futile rage against the door
the juggernaut shudders as its systems power up
the floor of the underground hangar begins to rise
the landing lights brighten shining like a beacon into the sky
on the bridge of the magellan janek stares out
in the distance the juggernaut rises out of the ground to eclipse the central pyramid
janek squints trying to understand what hes seeing a light races toward the magellan down the canal a rover
watts steers the rover recklessly hands locked on the controls
rifle slung over her shoulder
janek watches the rover come and the holloway alien boneless and white unfolds itself from the instruments over his head
its goblin shark jaw juts out
sinks its horrific teeth into janeks right shoulder
janek howls in agony
his right arm is paralyzed by the bite
he gropes at the pistol on his right hip with his left hand
the alien shakes him like a terrier killing a rat
janek gets the pistol
flips it in his hand
fires over his shoulder
two three rounds
the bullets punch easily into the alien but the soft flesh closes easily over the wounds sealing its white skin
its teeth tighten
watts comes out of nowhere in her space suit
swings a heavy rifle like a bat with all her strength
a crushing impact wrenches the aliens jaws loose
watts reverses the rifle
pulls the trigger
a fusillade of bullets shreds the aliens head
it collapses dead
watts wrenches her helmet off
rips a first aid kit from the bulkhead and helps janek to stanch the bleeding of his horrific wound
she gets the bleeding stopped
wraps him in bandages
janek will live but his right arm is useless
he looks at the body of the dead alien which is sinking into the deck plates as acid eats away at the metal
the juggernauts lifting
theres a living engineer on board
hes taking the ship to earth
janek blinks at her
we have to stop that ship
janek stares out the bridge window at the hulking juggernaut in its column of light
the nightfall storm front is rolling in a tidal wave of darkness on the horizon
a swelling rumble
were not a gunship
we have to do something
that ship is genocide if it gets to earth
janek stares at her
makes his decision
struggles to stand
get your helmet on
what about you
he shakes his head
watts helps him across the bridge
props him up in the captains seat
youll have to be my hands
stares out at the storm youre sure about this
watts nods grimly
he reaches out with his left hand
the ship shudders awakening
landing engines main
the prospecting ship raises its lifts and anchors
lifts off on landing rockets retracting its landing struts
janek grips the stabilizers with his left hand
take the stick
throttle up stick forward
watts sends the magellan careening toward the juggernaut just as the juggernaut begins to float off the ground
the magellan barrels toward the juggernaut skimming the ground as the storm wall sweeps closer
in the juggernauts pilot chair the sleeper sees them coming
his thoughts quicken
an explosion of light
the juggernaut leaps into the sky
the magellan roars through the cyclone of dust in its wake
barely avoids the pyramid
rakes around in a screaming turn and climbs in pursuit engines howling
janek and watts strain at the controls together
the magellan rolls into a howling climb
the storm catches up to them wind and dust reducing visibility to zero
the magellans radar finds the juggernaut
paints it with targeting data on the bridge window
but the juggernaut climbs too fast
we cant catch that
on the floor davids eyes open
with his jaw he hitches his severed head around
gets his eyes on the sleeper
in the pilot chair the sleeper convulses
an alien erupts from his chest
big as a wolf even at its birth
dark gray armored lethal
more hideous than any chestburster weve seen
it wails hideously
the sleeper dies
the alien slithers free
the juggernaut emerges from the stormclouds into the clear upper air but loses momentum
staggers through the upper atmosphere control lost
watts at the magellans controls stares as he juggernaut falters and falls
a crackle on the ships comm
the engineer is dead
you have a few seconds before the juggernauts computers take over
she seizes the precious moment centers the juggernaut in the bridge window
slams the throttle forward
the magellan hurtles out of the storm
a colossal impact
the juggernaut tumbles from the sky like a stone intact but crippled
the magellan breaks apart the ships modules scatter
some whole others broken
they fall back into the storm
the command module including the bridge falls intact
the engine sections rocket away across the chaotic sky
janek is strapped into his seat
watts goes flying
the bridge window shatters spraying glass spears in a lethal barrage across the bridge
watts picks herself up
finds the module in free fall
escape pods pop open
watts looks at janek
he is dead in his seat impaled by a lethal fragment of glass
the storm wall a chain of hurricanes rages below them
the command module tumbles back into the winds
watts dives into a coffin sized escape pod
she punches out
wattss pod a steel coffin shoots away on jets through the gale
the command module plunges through the storm tumbling
smashes against the ground in ruin
the engine pods hurtle to the ground and go nuclear sending walls of fire twisting through the hurricane
the shockwaves tumble wattss escape pod through the air
the pod lands cushioned by a drag chute and retro rockets
watts pops the pod open rising painfully to her feet in the storm
she surveys the destruction in disbelief
a deep rumble makes her turn
the juggernaut rolls toward her on edge a crushing wheel of death big as a mountain
like a child in a nightmare
the juggernaut bears down on her
she turns aside trying to get out of its course
even at a dead sprint she barely seems to move its so big
the juggernaut wobbles toward her
exhausted watts collapses gasping
the juggernaut rolls to the earth settling like a hoop right around her watts in the center
the winds carry the dust clouds away
watts passes out dropping her head to the earth
watts is awakened by a beeping alarm
she looks at her wrist
her suit flashes an oxygen warning minutes remaining
she looks up
the juggernauts doors are wide open in front of her
the ultramorph alien emerges from the juggernaut
as large as a man already
it sees her
with a sob of terror she pulls herself to her feet and runs
watts flees through the storm across the burning debris field
a wilderness of lightning fire and twisted metal
a thunderstorm with dust instead of rain
she looks back through the darkness
in a strobe light flicker of lightning she sees a gray demon approaching through the wreckage
she scrambles through a section of ductwork
under a hull fragment
running and clambering
the alien hunts her cat and mouse among the fragments of the magellan corridors that go nowhere shattered compartments
her eyes sweep frantically through the stormy night searching for a weapon
a hiding place
she stumbles into the remains of the magellans laboratory
a hypersleep freezer lies on the barren ground
watts climbs inside
pulls the lid shut
the alien passes by inches away
she watches it through the plexiglass holding her breath
the alien roots in the wreckage
finds the rotting engineers head among the shards of its vat
it begins to feed on the head growing as she watches
her suits oxygen alarm goes off again
the beeping draws the alien away from its dead meat
watts is paralyzed
the alien noses closer
sniffs at the plexiglass case
with sudden horrific violence it lashes out
sends the freezer flying
watts tumbles out
lurches to her feet and runs
the alien follows
she leads it a twisting chase through fragments of burning metal
watts trips and falls hard
picking herself up she sees shes tripped over a hull saw the same diamond bladed tool david used to dismantle the terraforming engine
she seizes the saw straining to manage its weight
hides in the hollow of a massive girder
the alien passes by
scenting the air
her arms trembling with the weight of the saw
waiting for it to pass
almost it leaves
but a tiny rattle of metal from the quivering saw brings it back
out of options watts powers up the saw
the blade whines up to speed
they lunge at one another in the same moment
the diamond blade shears off one of the aliens claws
the monster screams and recoils
its lashing tail sends watts sprawling
she loses the saw
the alien comes after her slinking low to the ground injured arm tucked to its chest
all vengeful fury
watts scrambles for the saw
the alien leaps for her
she rolls aside and like a scorpion the alien impales her thigh with its spear tipped tail
nails her to the ground
watts screams in agony
reaches for the saw still buzzing on the ground
its grip tantalizing inches from her fingertips
the alien stoops over her slavering face inches from her faceplate
its hideous jaws open
with all her strength watts pulls against the spike in her leg
drags the point of the spear through the dirt
she snarls through her teeth
the alien strikes just as watts grabs the saw
she meets the aliens head with the buzzing blade
a gout of green acid onto wattss helmet
the alien falls aside thrashing its death throes the saw still growling
watts sees acid coming through her helmet fast
with frantic haste she unlatches her helmet
wrenches it off as it crumples and melts
she stands bare headed in the toxic air
desperate she looks around with tearing eyes
in the distance she sees an intact module of the magellan
she runs for it
slaps the door switch
incredibly it opens
watts steps inside
the airlock closes behind her
she finds herself staring at a grand piano
shes in vickerss suite
its amenities intact through the floors a few degrees off level
she takes a breath
she walks around
turning things on
she drinks water from the tap
she opens the door to vickerss secret room
military space suits
a crackle from the rooms intercom
davids head lies battered in a dark corner of the wrecked juggernaut
eyes staring into the shadows
i know youre there
i can hear the beacon of your suit
watts strips off her space suit wearily
sits on the bed
id like to propose an arrangement
i can be repaired
i can talk you through it
watts shakes her head wearily
i think youll find i can be of use to you
watts walks to the intercom and switches it off
the storm has passed
the fragments of the magellan no longer burn
the gray world of lv restored
the wreck of the juggernaut looms in the misty distance
watts walks through the wreckage in a military space suit
rifle on her shoulder
pistol on her hip
she pulls a cargo dolly loaded with salvage
watts arrives at the vickers module
the ultramorph aliens head has been fixed like a grisly trophy above the door
watts strips off her space suit
she helps herself to a glass of vodka from the bar
a chessboard sits atop the grand piano a game in progress
rook takes bishop
makes the move on the board
have you decided
on our arrangement
im not going to fix you david
i dont need you
ill hold out
a ship will come
but who will send it
watts falls silent
she stares unhappily at the chessboard
its your move
the massive central pyramid rises in the midst of the engineer complex
with a boom a bright beam of light shines forth from its peak punching straight up through the clouds like a laser
other beams of light erupt from other pyramids
scorching the sky with their brightness
the barren moon hangs in space its father planet an angry red god in the background
two dozen beams of light rise from the moon visible even from space
