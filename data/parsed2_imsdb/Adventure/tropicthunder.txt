the movie has not started yet
after the last real trailer plays in the theater we see the universal logo
the globe stops rotating and starts to brown and crack
in a world where only one man made a difference
n a a post apocalyptic fiery tundra
and one man
who walks across it looking cool shirtless pumped with shades on holding a baby in one arm and a flamethrower in the other
this is international superstar chris michael speedman
there is a giant explosion behind him
he doesnt even flinch
the one man who made a difference
is about to make a difference
then speedman again shirtless is on an iceberg and an avalanche is thundering behind him
this time he has a set of twins and a flamethrower
chris michael speedman
is deke cogan
the new line logo over the stately pomp and this summer the halls of academia are about to get a lesson in
track across a bunch of cute ten year old schoolboys sitting at a dining hall table until we get to
jeff tropic thunder
he has red hair cut in a page boy style and is dressed in a school boy uniform which is way too small
from americas favorite fat guy
an angry headmaster scowls
the boys crack up
jeff portnoy is having
this summer lunch is on him
the fox searchlight logo comes up
an extremely beautiful james horner type score plays
i it is an oscar winning shot at dawn of a brooding handsome priest in a monks robe walking towards the church
this is kirk lazarus who has the intensity of a daniel day lewis and the seriousness of a sean penn
in a time where to be different was to be condemned
and to be condemned was to die
lighting the rosary candles
he glances over at another young priest who gives him a smoldering look
lazarus turns away tortured
one man chose to question his god
lazarus screams angrily at crucifix on the wall irish brogue you made me
why cant you
winner of the palm dor the golden bear the laughing monkey and over film critics best picture lists and hailed by roger ebert as a masterpiece never knew you had
three time oscar winner kirk lazarus in two time oscar winning director clint eastwoods boldest film
the title holds
now finally the movie starts
we see the dreamworks logo
which has no music under it
only the low pitched swooshing of a chopper blade
the thumping blade gets louder and louder the bass line of break on through to the other side rising with it until finally
a huey cobra in slow motion crests an impossibly beautiful jungle ridge flying low and straight at us
a gunner sprays fire down at unseen anti aircraft
all that can be see on the ground are whizzing tracers flying up at the chopper
the chopper skims the treetops heading toward a hot lz
as the cobra comes in hard about twenty infantrymen are emerging from the tree line in a chaotic fire fight with twice as many vc soldiers
chopper tries to land the gunner tosses a couple of grenades behind the americans sending about ten vc flying
but the bulk of the platoon is getting gunned down by the enemy
heavy set grunt fats looking like he is in great pain isrunning full speed for the chopper taking fire from all over
fats looks a lot like jeff portnoy star of
doody for dinner
year old cherry from brooklyn is also on the move towards the
clutching his thick black glasses and a
map and triangulating coordinates he is frantically trying to call in an air strike on his radio backpack
a grenade explodes ten feet away knocking him on his ass
he gets up shaken just in time to be bayoneted
through the stomach by a vc soldier
the vc soldier turns around just in time to be machine gunned down y motown who has all sorts of stomizd shit on his fatigues an ace of spades in
his helmet along with some graffiti scrawl that reads and god spoke including cut off sleeves that reveal his impressive pipes
he is a bad muthaf
thats for brooklyn muthafucka
underneath the hovering chopper osiris a black buffed out rambo looking sergeant is letting loose his m with abandon yelling at the pilot to get the bird lower
the mortally wounded brooklyn and slings him over his shoulder brooklyns shirt is blown open revealing his entrails
in shock he clutches his liver in his right hand and is trying futilely to put it back in his body
fats heaves brooklyn onto the floor of the still airborne chopper just as it gets low enough and returns to firing
he unleashes a hailstorm of lead at the approaching vc
fats ignores him and continueb firing
motown comes running up to the chopper
to osiris sir
requesting permission to disobey sergeants orders sir
four leaf is sir
we gotta didi now
air strike confirmed
this place is gonna be toast in about thirty seconds
osiris turns on motown pulling his
in the midst of the mayhem
he pushes it up into motowns neck
osiris standing on the skid motions for the chopper pilot to take off
motown looks to fats then reluctantly jumps on the chopper
it begins to hover
a i qft a soft whisper i id sarge
we push in on brooklyn dramatically as he raises his head
looking off to the tree line he points a crooked finger
its four leaf
everyone turns to see
four leaf who looks a lot like chris michael speedman from the scorcher trailer
burst through the treeline half limping half crawling heroically through the massive firefight in slow motion
he is being chased
by about fifty viet
everyone on board seems mesmerized
osiris sees it and cant believe his eyes
nevertheless he screams to the pilot
i fats still on the ground in defiance of osiris grabs the choppers runner and in a superhuman show of strength or is it weight holds it with all his
might preventing it from flying away
the pilot struggles with the controls as fats continues his barrage of bullets with his machine gun arm providing weak cover for four leaf
the chopper is now gaining momentum and pulls fats about ten feet off the ground
he is about to lose his battle with the helicopter
four leaf riddled with bullets and delirious is fighting a losing battle to gain ground
he doesnt even have a gun
osiris looks at the dejected faces of his men then at fats
a flash of anger and compassion comes over his face
four leaf christ like and arms extended sinks to his knees his body now absorbing unbelievable amounts of lead
weak smiles flicker across the face of the men as they do just that
unleashing lead all around osiris as he jumps out of the chopper like an apache warrior
fats drops off the runner of the chopper shooting his machine gun in cool slo mo
screaming a war cry osiris makes a beeline for four leaf
dancing between the raindrops he dodges tracer fire
osiris finally makes it and kneels beside four leaf cradling his head
four leafs eyes are glassy and his body and arms are ripped open all over like a rag doll
get outta here
im worm food man you dig
beginning to cry what and give up all that california pussy you been talking about
someones gotta show me around l
cracking a bloody smile shit
the only way youre gonna get a piece of la pussy if is you go out to the graveyard and dig some up
osiris looks down at four leafs now missing arms
you better come along and bring the shovel
he starts to choke up
scared i aint never gonna see another sunset
long philosophical beat why does a man want to pick up sticks against another man
stead of usin them sticks
to prop a man up
osiris nods now crying like a baby
i id iu i
igft beginning to fade hold my hands
cause i got somethin to say
osiris looks down
leafs bloody stringy stumps
theres nothing to hold
are you holding them
oh im holding them
i aint never been worth a
nothin in this life and its kinda late to start b e i a somethin now
you are my
b b brother
four leaf screws
face and begins to cry except that he cant
he tries again
hescrews up his face grotesquely
you are my
we now pull back to reveal we are actually on location shooting this war scene with about crew members watching surrounded by millions of dollars worth of film equipment
four leaf actually the superstar
playing him speedman is getting increasingly self conscious becoming more and
more aware of the crew waiting for him to cry
the actor playing osiris kirk lazarus is also getting uncomfortable holding speedmans not crying head
trailer now he is african american and speaks with an american accent it will be explained soon
the person perhaps most upset about it all is the skinny young british director damien dorfman
coiled at the monitor and covered in bug bites and sunblock wet towels around his neck and clearly not made for jungle life
he mouths the words you are my brothers
as if trying to will the tears from speedmans dry eyes
breaking character im sorry can we cut damien
damien grips his headphones in confusion looking around to his cadre of assistants and ads
the chopper continues to hover soldiers continue to fight except a few are starting to wonder whats going on
we gotta cut dorf
what did he say
to st ad play it through
now the extras have stopped fighting except for a few way far back
play it through
not still rolling
damien runs towards speedman
fats who is young fat comedy gross out star jeff portnoy gets up from the ground rubbing his butt
i fell right on my ass bone
other dead extras begin to hold their heads up and look around
some are amputee stuntmen
into megaphone damien
are we cutting
st ad jumps off the scaffold running towards the director
tekkies scurry around lots of confusion
are they cut or what
played by the not famous kevin sandusky ihold s his bloody liver up to hand off to someone
are we cutting sir
i think they put w ay too much blood in my liver again
get down kevin youre dead
sandusky immediately complies he seems to be the only actor listening to the director
i cant do it dorff
damien runs up to speedman
they are the center of attention the whole crew watching them
its good keep going
this is a big shot so keep going let it come
no arms youre hanging on its al coming out
its real death life brotherhood and we just
lets keep it going now
he starts to back out turning his finger in the still rolling motion
he gives a thumbs up to the ad
cody the grizzled looking pyrotechnic effects
guy paces in an elaborate tower rigged with efx detonation equipment
he is surrounded by a throng of local asian technicians who all hold various types of buttons and detonators
he punches buttons and surveys the chaos trying to figure out whats going on
is that the signal
the assistant doesnt appear to understand english
frustrated cody rips out an earpiece
iyd damien has his hands full with speedman
above the din of the dorf
seriously i think we should cut
i mean should osiris be crying too
maybe he shouldnt cry if im crying
lazarus abruptly drops speedman from his arms and gets up shaking his head
im sorry so just keep crying or arewe cutting
no no its good
portnoy is walking around massaging his butt
damien i think i broke my ass
is it possible to break your ass
get back in character portnoy
still rolling everyone
to lazarus great crying kirk stay with that
chris michael dont worry about where kirk is at just be four leaf crying right here and now and still rolling
codys crew buzzes around him in a countdown to armageddon
did he say go
loud into walkie tropic thunder
cody cont d the st a
get damien to pay attention to cody but he is too focused on getting speedman to cry
i iii i
lazarus gets back in position
he effortlessly turns
the waterworks back on sobbing like
a broken man
speedman starts to get back into position and then wait hey yknow maybe is it the line
you are my brothers
i dont think i would
four leaf wouldnt say that
yes well you see four leaf was there and he did say that
so lets just go
is he here or is he at the
because i would love to run it by him
i got to let them go
we need to pull the plug on the treeline burst if youre cutting
you know what this is nuts
you got my take
to speedman movie star
well be here till chinese new year waitin
for my man to
lazarus keeps walking
you got my take
ao a cell phone rings a hip hop ring tone
motown who is played by rap superstar and budding media mogul redykulous pulls the phone out and checks his text message
hey can we get this going
i got peeps coming to my room to rub me down at
his phone rings again
into phone hey
naw nothing same soup just re heated you know
redykulous wanders off in another direction
the ad is now yelling into damiens ear
losing it everyone
the chopper only has so much gas
portnoy trying to lighten the mood rips a huge fart
plenty of gas right here d man
then feeling the pain in his hey yo
i am trying to have a conversation here
what the fuck do i know
im just the fucking
inarticulate snarl godfuckit
damien throws his headphones off in frustration
and throws up his hands
cody sees damien throw up his hands
theres the signal
lets light this puppy up
lets go freaking tet here
i cody and his assistants push plungers buttons pull levers and drag metal wands over long lines of wired nails they spark and fizz
damien is still throwing his fit when
climaxing with joy as he barks commands and pushes ever more buttons
blows the helicopter backwards into a bank of lights causing them to tip
and begin a gigantic chain reaction that takes down most of the equipment then finally the men jump like fleas
cody lands on his back in pain which he seems to like
that was good for me
damiens mouth hangs open in shock
there is a strange quiet on the set
did we get that on film
the cameraman turns to the ad and then back to damien looking a bit scared
chris michael was saying to cut so we cut the ad comes up to the lost looking damien
to damien im gonna have to call it damien
damien is silent stunned
into megaphone okay thats a wrap fortoday
if you are
in injured please find the set medic
speedman looking as if he had nothing to do with what just happened walks toward damien
i think i got another in me if you want to go again damien
damien looks at the scorched treeline behind them
speedman looks too then looks back at damien
in the background cody is casually putting out a fire on his lap
he gives an im o
gesture to no one in particular
el television opening graphics after a flashy montage julie moran the cute el news daily reporter walks through the tropic thunder set in a halter top talking to camera well
it might look like here in the tiny southeast asian country of bien den phu but it is and they are making history
we are here with an e
exclusive the first look behind the scenes at what hollywood insiders are calling the most expensive war movie ever produced
its called tropic thunder and first time director damien dorfman has assembled an all star cast to play the forgotten grunts who perished near here more than years ago
julie contd heading up the ensemble the highest grossing action star of all time chris michael speedman
d i but the last few films have not blown up for speedntan as hes struggled to broaden his range as an
first an attempt to change gears with a comedy
speedmanand martin lawrence both with guns are holding up a bank speedman in drag
they yell at each other in that uptight white guy loose cannon black guy action comedy style
the disappointing chitlin and the dude was followed
with last years failed venture into serious dramatic territory
innoveralls and with a bad haircut dressed as a farm hand
he holds a pony by the reins as he talks to it by rubbing his nose on the ponys neck
simple jack the story of a mentally impaired farm hand who can talk to animals was a box office disaster that many critics called one of the worst movies of
as simple jack you mu mu muhhh make meha aaaapy
to camera but now the question is can speedman mu mu make audiences happy in the true life story of war hero four leaf tayback in tropic thunder
and possibly a shot az
at that elusive gold statuette
julie sits with speedman
with them is the real four leaf a stoic grizzled man of few words
very serious all i want is to make the real four leaf here proud
its his story he lived it and wrote it in his book
thats why were here
but really i mean how cah we begin to understand what he what you went through
four leaf fixes his stoic steely gaze on the horizon for a beat
he lifts his hands up and we see he has only two hooks
speedman studies him closely aping his gestures trying to get inside him as much as possible
when i lost these
holds his hooks up it was as if i saw through these for the first time
indicates his eyes and it was only then that i really began to use these
indicates his ears thats great
hes like a
buddha or something
maybe i should rub his belly for luck
he laughs but quickly realizes four leaf doesnt find it funny
to speedman like for a lucky oscar nod this time
maybe you should rub kirk lazaruss belly
he already has three
speedman laughs uncomfortably trying to seem unperturbed
i i nm y in his normal
look caucasian and irish much like he was in the satans alley trailer
three time oscar winner kirk lazarus reclusive brilliant irishman considered by many
the best actor of his generation and also a known bad boy
stills of a drunken lazarus outside a new york bar punching a paparazzo
is famous for his total immersion into whatever role he plays
transform into the role of the african american sergeant who saved four leafs life
lazarus is examined by a doctor
lazarus went to shocking and controversial lengths
lazarus lies in a hospital bed covered in bandages
after undergoing experimental pigmentation alteration procedures in a singapore clinic this was the startling result
a doctor dversees as nurses carefully peel the bandages off lazaruss head
lazarus is now black
in the hotel with the entire cast sitting in front of a banner touting the movies title
lazarus speaks in his osiris character voice we heard at the beginning of the film one that he will never there are all these young brothers who got no role
models but a bunch of pimp acting rappers who glamorize a life of gangsterism and womanizing
im just grateful to have this opportunity to be able to represent
redykulous hears this looks pissed
getting awards shooting documentary footage in sierra leone of warring tribesmen
british documentary director damien dorfman has never made a theatrical movie before but his mission he says is to bring a reality to the film that he feels is missing
from most hollywood epics
my goal quite simply is for an audience member to walk out of the cinema feeling as if they were in vietnam for two hours
are you intimidated about working with actors for the first time
damien contd not really mate
i tell you whats intimidating
filming a seven foot hutu warrior who is readylto shove his machete up your ass if you look at him cockeyed
i think i ban handle actors of the unarmed variety
well hell certainly have his hands full with king of comedy jeff portnoy
a fuckedlup looking portnoy being taken away by a bailiff
after being arrested for heroin cocaine and crack possession portnoy is out to prove he can
stay clean and get audiences addicted to seeing him in a movie without any potty
redykulous struts out and does a ridiculously lewd dance with about five hip hop asses
surrounding his face
and from the world of hip hop multi
platinum selling rapper producer and clothing designer redykulous and star of his own hit reality show utterly redykulous
redykulous is in his redykwear sweats
as far as redykulous is concerned you know i always believed youve got to exploit every opportunity
he holds up a can of pymp sweat
thats why my new sports drink pymp sweat is the official beverage on the set of tropic thunder as well as my new energy bar the bust a nut with
all proceeds going to clean up land mines in this previously war ravaged area
at a reported budget north of million tropic thunder could end up costing almost as much as the real war
but the good news for damien dorfman and his troops the oscar buzz is already starting
so for el news im julie all of a sudden portnoy wearing a tropic thunder cap all askew and surfer shorts with no shirt bursts out of the bushes
he screams wildly and grabs julie who cracks up laughing at his stunt
silly voice me so horny
me so horny
he jumps into the pool with her
what a crack up
it is the one hotel in the area and it looks like it has been through a war which it probably has
it has been taken over as the tropic thunder production headquarters
we see a mix of production people and hotel workers
were shutting you down dorf
damien sits behind his desk looking scared
vietnam photos maps and sketches cover the walls
standing in the office are assorted crew including cody and four leaf who whittles a stick with his hooks never looking up
they are all staring at a speaker phone
you cant do that todd
yes we can
the dailies are not good
dailies are always bad
bad dailies good movie
isnt that what they say
i never heard that saying
three weeks behind and youve been shooting for five days
fact we greenlit this project at a very specific number a number walter and i could get in bed
with and fact
starting to lose it todd it really isnt necessary for you to keep saying fact before everything
its kind of implied that if you are saying
trying to keep the emotion out of it so i thought i would say
fact before each fact so it would be less upsetting i ok damien this is walter im just gonna jump in
and bad cop
it here for a second
dude i mean dollars for chris michael speedmans masseuses miscellaneous living expenses
it sounds like the inmates are running the asylum
well yes thats exactly it
walter if you actually came out here you would see that
these actors are loud out ofnowhere the actors didnt blow up the rainforest and forget to turn on the camera damien
i have a lot of tolerance but when
lt comes to nature i lose it
ao voice of todd contd i will not be called an eco terrorist do you understand that
damien looks a bit bewildered by that
his hot young assistant comes in with a cell phone
whispering to damien its chris michael he says its important
damien shaking now steps out on to the balcony and slides the glass door shut
though the hotel is a shambles the view out on to the bay is spectacular
trying to seem calm yes chris
in stark contrast to the hotel where everyone else is living speedman is in what looks like an asian presidential palace overlooking the ocean
speedman is standing on the deck trying hard to hold the phone with his hook hands
simple jack plays on a flat screen inside
just wanted to call and throw a little pep talk your way
i know today was rough and youre probably mad at yourself for not getting the shots but thats the way these movies go
we all boot it from time to time and today was just one of those days
sickly sweet yes it does
though i do think you have to realize chris that you are somewhat responsi tropic thunder
oh also needed to let you know and i
know youre like wrapped up with the movie but i really need that new chef like we talked about you know to really get that super ripped thing happening
this guy is great but all he makes are dumplings
and they stiill havent worked out the tivo thing
i i i right
well those things
im dealing with bigger issues right now chris yeah of course i just know we talked about getting super super ripped for that starvation sequence speedmans other line goes
he sees the caller i
oh shit can you hang on a sec d
he switches over but it takes a few seconds with the hooks
rick peck head of the peck agency sits in his office overlooking
he has a headset on
guess what im staring at right now
im looking at your ugly mug on the back of vanity fair magazine in beautiful living color with the two cute cuddly pandas from cuteville
we see pedk is holding a vanity fair with an ad on the back it is a picture of speedman looking earnest holding two baby pandas
the caption reads the credibility factor that the pandas give you is priceless and strangely if you see this picture what really strikes me is the credibility that you give
ive been getting psychotic feedback all day
hey did you get the basket i sent
we see a survival themed gift basket in a camouflage backpack theres a satellite phone camouflage sunblock etc
no im fine
ive just been having a tough time over here
they still havnt got the tivo hooked up and
i dont know
lazarus is getting all this oscar buzz already is that what this is about
crazy kirk lazarus goes and places his entire body in some experimental malaysian dipping sauce so he can actually be black of course hes gonna get buzz
listen to what i am telling you
he is clinically mentally not right
yeah but the way they talk about him
i mean he played a retarded guy and won an oscar i play a retarded guy and dont even get a nomination
i dont know i mean you said simple jack would be my elf but with oscars
those were your exact words
i dont believe those were my exact words but lets get beyond that to the root of this
remember the moment you chose to do this and i wanted you to do the esp robot thing with wolfgang petersen
and i said stay home be happy and you said no rick i need to play a real human being and i said okay and then i said are you
and you said that you needed this for your soul
yes but which i totally respected and now youre doing the crazy surfer three
sixty move on me
which i love by the way but you said fuck it i gotta do it for my soul and thats why i hate you
because you were right
and youre in
the phuc long fucking delta
in the real mud with leeches in your hair mil es from fatburger
being an actor and i would wager forcing everyone around you to rise to your level
am i right
i mean you are over there forcing a bunch of pussy actors to gel straighten up and
become a platoon
and it hurts
am i right
speedman actually seems tohave bought this yeah
you are right
alright thats what
now get to work genius soldier
ill handle the tivo
peck hangs up abruptly
speedman punches the button on his cordless and puts
he ponders ricks words as he gets caught up watching the end scene of simple jack on his tv
he has forgotten damien is on the other line
damien stands holding the phone still on hold
through the glass we see the entire crew waiting silently behind him
as simple jack shu sure is a puh puh purty sssssssunrise uh uh uh uh aint it
finally after a few moments of listening to this damien explodes
he throws the phone on the ground and jumps up and down on it
he notices the crew staring at him
he tries to look as if that just didnt happen
he opens the sliding glass and heads straight to the door
he continues walking through his office out into the main offices
he motions for his assistant to join him
this is not going to go away
im going to be on my cell all day im going to a funeral but im keeping it on
thats where were at with this
he walks with purpose followed by his assistant
get everyone together
we are having a cast meeting tonight
everyone must attend
i am putting my foot down
i dont think i can do that damien
chris is having that end of first week party at his place tonight
damiens eyes twitch oddly
it is an apocalypse now theme party
tiki torches buffets
playboy playmate dancers circa are dancing on a deck in front of a banner that reads one week down
the crew and cast are partying their asses off
i n i i i nmi al waiters dressed like bald marlon brandos in full face camo serve hors doeuvres
portnoy not looking very sober jumps up on the stage with the dancers and starts doing a striptease
damien walks in watching this scene from caligula going down
he looks in a deep funk
portnoy stage dives straight onto the lawn landing with a thud in front of damien
jeff are you alright
need to talk as
a cast as a platoon right now
sick and drunk dorfie did you happenito see that grip withthe bandana
the big guy
i was supposed to meet him here
he has a package of mine
kevin sandusky brooklyn from the movie comes up to them looking fresh faced and eager
that was some hit you took today
who are you
are you serious
im playing brooklyn
hey have you seen that grip with the bandana
i think but portnoy is off already looking for his drug connection
they both watch him go
dorfman i was hoping to find you
i know this is a party but this afternoon after work i was breaking down my m and i have to say in the night watch scene a minute and
a half is a pretty short amount of time to assemble it
you actually care dont you
this is a huge opportunity
to be working with all these great actors and you
youre the only one who auditioned
youre the only one who did the two week boot camp sandusky
yeah i know
it was kind of weird
wasnt the point that we were all supposed to bond
yes that was the point
damien grabs a drink from a passing tray and downs it
we follow a waiter as he passes speedman with a tray of food
speedman ungracefully and with his hook hands grabs a spring roll off the tray
he resumes talking to lazarus who is deeply uninterested
r tropic thunder
i guess i just watched some retarded people
i mean i spent a lot
watching all the retarded stuff they did
huh i always found mere observation a little rudimentary
gotta dig deeper to mine the true emotional paydirt
diagram the source of the pain
then live it
to keep up exactly
i was for the first time in my life
searches for the word retarded
i was retarded
the trailer retarded at home
in a weird way i had to unlearn what it was to be
but simple jack thought he was smart
or rather didnt think he was retarded
so you can afford to play retarded being a smart actor
tricky tricky stuff
hats off for going
knowing how the academy is about that shit
speedman is lost about what
with a chuckle are you serious
everyone knows you dont ever go fully retarded
how do you mean
lazarus sets his
schools in session
check it out
dustin hoffman rain man
he could count toothpicks cheat at cards
lazarus contd retarded
had braces on his legs he charmed the pants bff nixon and won a ping pong competition
peter sellers being there infantile
he claps a hand on speedmans shoulder
you went full retard man
you never go full retard
dont believe me
ask sean penn i am sam
went full retard
went home empty handed
speedman sees this for the truth it is
how could he be so stupid
cruelly driving it home but hey man
four leaf could be your ticket to oscar gold
id lose the hook hands though
cripples dont give the academy wood either
lazarus laughs and excuses himself by rattling his glass and heading for the bar
speedman stands hurt delicately holding the spring roll in his hook
damien paces the party
he looks more miserable and high strung than ever
he discovers redykulous surrounded by his posse and a camera crew
i need to talk to you
what up money
in a hushed tone aware of the cameras were having a cast meeting right now we need to come together as a unit the camera crew moves in for the
making damien uncomfortable
redykulous takes it in stride
throughout the scene he is text messaging someone
damien is made uncomfortable by the cameraman who has i started manually zooming in and out on him in a dutch style camera move
damien i do you mind if we step away for a moment
damien tries to indicate the crew
whispering even lower now from the
oh i see
sure they take a few steps away from the bar
the entire camera crew follows
no i mean away from the cameras
away from indicating the crew them
i cant do that
if redykulous steps away from the cameras then my people dont get to see the real redykulous
the show is called utterly redykulous
well this is about work
my show so to
do you understand
but not really
your show and my show are the same thing
this is gonna help your show trust me
redykulous contd my show and the soundtrack drops the same time tropic thunder opens
so you get that crossover audience everybody wants on your opening weekend which will dictate your revenue streams all the way through dvd release pay per view etcetera
damien thinks this over for a second
it does sort of make sense
he then notices the chmera crew pushing in k i for a close up he awkwardly tries to get away from them
excuse me everyone
if i could have your attention
no one notices except speedman
damien grabs a couple bottles off the bar and bangs them together
sorry to break up the party but i just wanted to call your attention to a cast meeting tonight
future of the film depends on it
not to mention my entire bloody life
damien in a final cry of frustration smashes a bottle on the bar
he succeeds only in cutting his hand
speedman comes up placing a calming hook on damiens shoulder
he steps to the fore
slowly deliberately when
we see were kind of the same
within moments the place settles completely
then almost quietly
when we put aside our differences we see were kind of the same
lets be friends i know we will do great things together
beat then more upbeat tropic thunder
speedman contd thats a quote from my childrens book the boy everybody was jealous of
i know its just a book for
kids but i think it applies to
making a movie as well
i know a lot of the reason things are maybe messed up is me
the guys look at each other maybe hes not so bad
i was looking at it all backwards
you guys are lost
lead you to help you gel and straighten
up like a platoon
a long beat
drunk out of his mind hey
that bullshit peptalk made me
h h h h h happy
the entire party cuts
in loud hysterics
speedman looks hurt
the dj puts on a redykulous track really loud and the place gets even crazier
damien drunk walks along illuminated by the light of the moon
he holds a bottle of wine which
in the distance the party rages
when a herd loses its way the shepherd must kill the bull that leads them astray
damien turns around
four leaf is standing eerily in the bushes by the sand
you dont know which way is up do you private
you couldnt find a dixie coonskin with an ohio hooker holding your prick
and showin you the way
damien doesnt know what the fuck that meant
four leaf moves to him staring deep into his eyes
damiens eyes widen in fear
a raindrop cannot carve a valley
an ant cannot defeat a buffalo
but a tempest can cleave that mountain to make the valley and an army of ants can fell the mighty buffalo
seeing the wisdom of this yes
if the lion although king of the jungle is thrown into the sea he will drown
lives in the
water for many years he will
do you understand
long pause he lunges at damien and grabs him by the collar with both hooks
near tears now i want to
but not really
someones an ant
i put my story in your limp brit hands and you will not fail me
long pause my boys were worse pussies than these guys
but the shit is what made us a unit
you must put them in the he releases damien and takes a large draw on his cigarette
theres a place
about a hundred clicks from here as the crow flies
deep in the jungle
no trailers no port a potties
nothing but triple canopy jungle and cockroaches the size of melons
damien seems intrigued yet a little freaked out by his weirdness
rig up your documentary camerasin that jungle give me and cody a few of those smoke bombs and some charges and we could light up the jungle so those lily
dick actors would think they were in the middle of
get them thinking theyre getting shot at and youll have your movie
suddenly four leaf slaps his neck with his hook as though he has been bitten
he holds out a small squished mosquito between the claws of his prosthesis
you must put them
under your thumb the way this
bug is under mine
under your control
they would be under my total control
i could shoot the whole movie there
away from their pampered pussy posses and helpers
put them in the real shit
film them with real fear in their eyes
damien and four leaf share a crazed look
cool music up as we push in and
a chopper skimming the treetops illuminated by a lonely moon
cody is piloting
damien and four leaf are in the back sitting across from speedman portnoy redyk and lazarus and sandusky
we move across the faces of the actors all in brainbuckets who all look confusted and unhappy except for sandusky who seems excited
speedman clutches the camouflaged gift bag from his agent rick peck
so uh any idea how long well be gone
because i left most of my
vitamins back at the hotel
the other actors chime in with similar concerns regarding sleeping arrangements make up facilities etc
save your breath maggots
they all shrink back
four leafs fierce posture is undercut as the helicopter lurches sending damien sprawling onto hire
the chopper lands in a small clearing as the sun rises behind a mountain
damien and four leaf in di mode hustle the grunts off the chopper
apparently they are not moving fast enough four leaf and damien shove the guys out of the chopper onto the ground
the group scared shitless start falling out of the doors of the chopper more like a bunch of oysters than a crack platoon
four leaf jumps on the skid of thy chopper and motions to cody who lifts off
it kicksi up a violent backwash iq y forcing the guys to duck
see you in hell
as the noise of the helicopter fades the group starts
trying to orient itself in their new surroundings
black dense unforgiving
all around them can be seen the remnants of a war that has been over for thirty years
a grave marker
half of an old rusted outadowned chopper
all are absorbing the spookiness except portnoy who seems very upset
this is bullshit
damien marches over to him and slaps him repeatedly in the face
clutching his cheeks silence
everyone hands over their phones
speedman however turns away from the group getting his
satellite phone out of the gift bag
he surreptitiously stows it down the front of his pants
i ao damien dumps them in a pile and finds a large boulder
he smashes the phones with a draatic flair
the guys groan
damien turns on them with a crazy gleam in his eye
now that i have your attention i will tell you fuckfaces what were doing here
you are no longer actors in a movie
you are grunts in a war
these men around you are your brothers
the guys look at each other unhappy
youve just landed in the shit
your objective is to head north and liberate the village at dang kwook hill at which point four leaf gets himself captured at which point you rescue him at which
point we will chopper you home
we will also be rigging this entire valley of death with hidden cameras so that every glorious moment gets on film
and believe me it will be glorious
if it looks real chances are good it probably is
you wanted to be actors
you wanted to occupy the skin of another human being
get ready to occupy the skin of a terrified u
infantry grunt surrounded by death crawling up satans arsehole
theres going to be enemy fire
your own personal little slice of the nam
the group shares a look whats going on
he pulls out a laminated packet
dman four leaf since youre the captain here heres the scene list and the map
he throws them at him think you can handle it
from now on whatever we get on film is our movie period
damien pulls out a walkie talkie
this is your only link to the real world
it will be used only in an emergency or to replenish our supplies if absolutely necessary
this is not a cell phone
this radio goesto the chopper and the chopper only
the chopper is god and i am jesus christ his soni
you will depend on and pray to us
and nobody i ii i i n i i imdi gets home until we get the shots
loud and confident now
letsput the greatest war movie ever in the can
with that damien marches toward the treeline andsteps on a dormant land mine left sleeping for decades
blowing the group stands absolutely stock still for several long beats until
a group of about six asian guerilla fighters well armed and scary looking
notice the sound of the explosion
they begin talking very seriously in a foreign language
one of them grabs a radio crackling over walkie talkie they lock and load heading towards the actors
four leaf scans the horizon while
cody sets up high tech equipment including monitors and cameras and detonation devices
so im thinkin as soon as damien gives us the go ahead wei ust their cherry with a few airbursts then alpha alpha till they come running right at us
then a good of fashioned firefight maintaining our distance
four leaf ignores him instead looking around the jungle looking almost lost
i been meaning to tell ya the whole shoot
im probably one a your biggest fans
your book was kinda my catcher in the rye
it inspired me to become a gyro man
four leaf gives cody nothing except his usual stoic stare
im actually sort of a war nut
i mean i never was in the service but for me blowing shit up in a war films is sort of my way of paying tribute to the real deal
and you sir are the real deal
hey i was wonderin what kind of sidearm you carry
looks to me like a very scary i dont know what its called
i just know the sound it makes when it takes a mans life
cody a little spooked picks up his radio
ok were ready to rock and roll
to walkie talkie damien come in
cameras are up ordinance are up
ready to kick the tires and light the fires on your say so
we are close on the seemingly broken
which has heard none of this
we pull back to reveal the guys staring at damiens corpse in total shock
all except speedman who looks on with a smirk
i think hes like
with a chuckle nice very nice dorf
very nice wherever youre hiding
i dont think hes hiding
i think he just died
sandusky leans down towards the off screen corpse
pulls a wrist into frame
have a pulse
or a head
he then grabs a bent and rusty
piece of metal
mustve been one of those claymore mines
this old jungle must
be full of them
you bet your ass it is
thats why a percentage of my pymp sweat profits are helpin solve the problem
damiens corpse emits a disturbing death rattle
speedman busts up laughing
they turn to him what the hell
speedman throws an arm
around sandusky like an indulgent older brother
dont you get it
this is what dorf was talking about our slice of the nam
hes trying to get in our heads
they are right behind the treeline watching the guys from about thirty feet
that whole life and death speech in the chopper
hes meshing with us
what do you think all that playing god was about
the guys breathe a huge collective sigh of relief except lazarus
are you nuts shithead
the dude is dead
sandusky looks unsure
he doesnt want to take sides
i know youre the big fancy actor here but no offense ive done a lot mote effects driven event films and i think i can spot a prop body
the lead guerilla signals for all his guys to hold their fire and pick their targets
suddenly the walkie talkie lying on damiens body crackles to life i repeat we are now go for mission
the walkie crackles unintelligibly
speedman picks it up showing it to the guys
alright can we start the scene now
or do you need a formal invitation
checking the list scene a ext
speedman closes his eyes taking a second to get into character
he opens them and grabs
his gun and creeps towards the bushes stealthily
as four leaf i got a baaaad feeling on this one fats
the group remains motionless
speedman gives portnoy a m in maim cmon
portnoy doesnt know what he means
i said i got a baaad feeling on this one brooklyn
sandusky hesitantly takes the cue and starts walking
with him on high
swinging his gun unpredictably
they are a mere ten or fifteen feet from sandusky on the other side of the
they back off as
he waves his gun
as brooklyn me too capn
i told you something something kinda personal you wouldnt think i was crazy right
i know you aint crazy brooklyn
if i told you that i i never actually well been with a girl
you wouldnt like think i was like queer or nothin
i wouldnt think you was a queer
i ao redykulous shrugs and joins in too acting really black guy sh
when i get back to the world im gonna find me the finest piece of detroit nubian mugambo and fuck it till i broke its back
the last mugambo you ever tasted was in your mommas soup bowl
i wouldnt mind slurpin on a little of that thats enough outta you fats
dont you worry brooklyn
you gotta lotta days a fucking ahead of you and i for one aint gonna let charlie
lazarus cant handle it anymore
what the fuck is wrong with you people
speedman shoots him a look then takes a few steps back
he addresses the treeline
back to one
he gets back in character dont you worry brooklyn you gotta yo asshole
mothafucka just died
speedman sighs annoyed
how many more takes you wanna wreck
some of us are taking this seriously
lazarus looks likes he wants to explode
but instead he becomes eerily calm
he begins an impressive transformation everything except for his skin color returns to his real identity a pompous irish prick
heavy irish jaysus
there isnt going to be any movie ya gobshite
lazarus contd damien is dead speedman
yes the show must go on but this is feckin madness
re lazarus transformation i wow
that was really cool
are watching this poised to attack
speedman and lazarus argue more heated now
excuse me kirk i think you dropped something
he mimes picking something off the ground
its called your character
dont worry i wont tell the academy
suddenly gunfire from everywhere
the guerrillas have seized the moment
the actors all immediately hit the dirt except for speedman
who just looks annoyed and blase as dirt and debris kicks up all around him
you happy now
were out of position for the effect
am i the only one who read the script
this is the ambush
a tree abovespeedman gets hit explodes sprays chunks of wood and shrapnel everywhere
i think theyre really shooting at us
what are you guys worried about
these guys are pros
the unions would tear them a new ass if any of us got hurt
the actors stay down looking scared
come on you guys
lets use this
no one follows speedmans lead
fine hell go it alone
speedman begins shooting at the guerillas alone and doing a very good job of it going through an assortment of absurd action style maneuvers throughout
redykulous looks around and then decides to get up and join him
sandusky and portnoy look at each other what the heck and follow
they all fire at the unseen enemy letting out very convincing war cries
not knowing its only blanks and awed by the power of the actors automatic weapons and the intensity of their screams they drop back
the guerillas hastily go through their packs hooking up rpgs
four leaf looks out into the jungle below he can hear the firefight but cody cant
cody is preoccupied with the radio and the explosives
i still cant get damien on the radio
i bet he forgot how to use the walkie again
what do you say we get a little
cody very excited grabs a plunger
still fighting oblivious that the guerillas are about to blow them to kingdom come with rpgs
but before the guerillas have a chance t tropic thunder
he pushes down the plunger
dirt flies the guerillas dont know what the hell is going on except that someone is suddenly bombing the shit out of them
they beat a hasty retreat
cody and four leaf watch codys handiwork with binoculars
a smoke cloud slowly rises from the jungle
i bet damien heard that
cody turns to four leaf and finds himself staring straight at guerilla fighters with their submachine guns pointed straight at them
and with that cody and four leaf are
rifle butted out of consciousness
speedman motions for everyone to cease fire
thats the trailer right there
that was some sick shit
i wasnt even thinking bout the camera
the guys adrenaline is flowing they do high fives all around
lazarus is not happy
he looks off into the jungle sensing that someone was out there
so what do we do now
speedman pulls out the map frowns at it
damien said to head north
im guessing theyve got more of these battles and viet congs rigged for uls on the way
into it alright lets hump our shit to dang kwook
lets didi double time
we got a lot of clicks to cover
speedman heads off into a particularly dense section of jungle
after a beat he reappears looking a little lost
sir isnt it that way
kevin points in the other direction
speedman glances down at the map which he rotates around right side up now
cant believe it kevin
okay to dang kwook
lets do it to it
everyone follows speedman
lazarus very reluctantly brings up the rear still looking off into the jungle
a it is a large secret heroin processing facility surrounded by barbed wire fencing
it is in a clearing in the jungle by a small river
theres a guard tower overlooking a main gate which leads into a big open courtyard area
the main structure is a low concrete military looking building
its all populated with tough looking well armed badasses
cody and four leaf both hog tied and unconscious are marched through the courtyard and into a building
we are behind the back of the person who is in charge
in front of him we see workers busily manufacturing tar heroin in a sweatshop like atmosphere
a cadre of guerilla fighters domes in sweaty and tired
the lieutenant steps to the fore this is byong
hes badly shaken
the unseen leader shakes
the actors are slogging along through a tall thicket of bamboo
they look exhausted except for speedman who always manages to look like
were just supposed to keep walking
well see some action soon enough
and try to stay in character
were on camera
what do you mean soon
whenever damien decides its time i guess
i dont know
thats the whole point
damien wants us tired and confused
yeah well im definitely qualifying for those objectives
everyone chimes in they all need a break
lazarus notices the mutinous vibe and smiles
okay lets take a break but be on the lookout for anything
charlie doesnt care if youre on a break or not
speedman plunks down and opens the map
he seems puzzled
lazarus eyes him suspiciously
sandusky walks off to take a leak
lazarus then watches him go
off to the side sandusky starts to pee
he hears something rustle next to him
sandusky turns to see lazarus peeing uncomfortably close to him
speedman is watching
i dont have much time
i dont really need to piss
i need to talk to you
you went to the boot camp sandusky right
you can read that map
speedman is a tosser
that hoors melt really thinks this is a movie
and hes got the lot of ya convinced
you saying you dontithink theyre filming us
of course not
its only a matter of time before he walks us into more mines or more of whoever the hell was shootin at us
that muppets going to get us all killed
i need to convince everyone
to turn around but i
cant do it without the map
youre the only one who can read it
can i count on you
well yeah i
but good man good man
lazarus makesa big show of pretending hes done peeing shaking etc
and heads back to the group
speedman eyes lazarus
what is he up to
sandusky is just getting comfortable begins to pee again
he hears another rustle
to see speedman right next to him
im gonna level with you bro
i dont need to pee
i need to talk to you
speedman surreptitiously takes out a can of pymp sweat and sticks the tip of his bowie knife into it to create a red pee
lazarus is insane
hes freaking out and
ruin the whole movie for all of us
the men respect you because you went to boot camp and rehearsal
patting his shoulder and youre pretty handy with that map
i need you on my side kyle
if you stick with the program im gonna talk to some of the dreamworks brass
therell probably be a teen choice award in it for you
you have that potential
well i good man
speedman rejoins the group gives lazarus a cocky look
the guys continue to trudge along a hugely overgrown path
speedman machetes through the overgrowth
if we stay on this trajectory we should be reaching the village any minute now
at the end of the line we hear a few groans emanating from portnoy
buck up fats
we got a long road ahead of us
its just that i dont feel so hot
i left my medication at the hotel
to himself snickering yeah id like to check out some of those meds for my own self
lazarus moves up to speedman
look ya eejit i mean if there was a village dont you think we would have hit it by now
quit your carping were right where were supposed to be
all of a sudden speedman disappears out of frame
we see he has fallen chest deep into the edge of a slow laughing hey is there a feckin river on that map
pee dman refers to thenow sopping wet map
its just a little more down to the
lefty down part from the village
checking the scene list anyway
this feels like the sampan boat raid at the end of the second act
i dont see a sampan boat
any second now one should come by
alright men into the water
everyoneexcept lazarus reluctantly gets into the water
they all hold their rifles above their heads
l et s stop this char ade sha l l we
we need to quit faffin about and turn
lazarus grabs sandusky
dont you sandusky
kevin is caught not sure what to d wait
first of all
now speedman grabs him
kelvin believes in this movie
and second need i remind you
i am your superior officer
pao no yer an actor
arid if memory serves a pretty shite one
the actors react damn
speedman steels himself
thats the way out
thats our only chance
yeah but maybe we should stay here until they send help
or maybe try to get back to the hotel
help from where
need i remind you that damiens orders were to right at lazarus stay in character
to the guys now i already have an international box office presence but for some of you im guessing you might not want to screw this movie up
this actually seems to affect the actors
lazarus cant believe it
lets go get those viet congs
lazarus throws down his gun
hes had it
jay sus fuck
its viet cona
not viet congs
viet cong you plunker
and hey if youre so sure of yourself why dont you let kelvin have a look at the map
kevin doesnt know what to do he doesnt want to get in the middle of this
speedman continues to be the tough guy
be my guest
speedman hands over the soggy map
after a long beat
weve been going the wrong way
we were supposed to be doing this sandusky traces his finger along the correct route a clearly marked northward arrow
instead we did this
i i i d iv i
m sandusky draws a line due east
section of the
map clearly marked with scary skull and cross bone type warnings
holding his stomach oh man this is not cool this is not cool at all
speedman grabs the map back from sandusky
i cant believe you people
youre pussing out on me
we are supposed to be a unit
no one is pussing out
they just prefer not
sandusky can you getus back to the landing zone without the map
it might be tricky but maybe
okay which is it gentlemen
playin war with mister box office
or staying alive
are you guys really gonna abandon this movie
a long tense
beat finally sandusky walks towards lazarus
everyone follows him
speedman looks stunned
after a moment he shakes his head and begins crossing the river holding his rifle with both hands over his head
so thats the way it is huh
ill finish the movie alone
turns to lazarus under his and when i give my acceptance speech ill be sure to thank you lazarus for staying out of that scene
and come oscar night well see who feels a little full retard
he reaches the other side of the river
chris you have no idea where youre going
yeah i do
consulting the scene list im going to exs
four leaf pinned down and alone
and i can shoot it alone
theywatch him trudge into the foliage
u s bullet the blue sky comes up as the men watch speedman disappear
we slowly push in on a lone figure silhouetted against the purple sky trudging along the top of a trail to nowhere
speedman walks through the scary jungle exhausted
he is tired lonely and hungry
the jungle is making all sorts of terrifying noises
finally he stops and regards the treeline
whats the deal with a meal break
are they gonna chopper stuff in later on
i dont wanna be a prima donna or anything but we gotta eat right
p tropic thunder
clearly no answer
he trudges a bit further finally plunking down
by the trunk of a huge tree
he empties his pack within which is the gift bag
he surveys his wares an i pod
nano an in style magazine a neck pillow cherry chapstick a tonight show baseball hat some packets of equal and an unopened mrs
henderson presents dvd
our guys led by lazarus are humping through a dense section of jungle
portnoy is beginning to make all sorts of pained and horrible noises
its after a beat ohhh god
its like a sweat lodge out here
make a note gentlemen
unwittingly jeffrey portnoy is joining the proud ranks of those of us who have suffered for art
to portnoy a new frontier for you funny man
when this is all over you might have more than flatulence to offer an audience
portnoy looks a little hurt
you know what
i think i actually liked you better when you were a nigga
you know redykulous i respect what it is you do the rapping the rhyme talking invented by the irish i might add
lazarus contd yet you ooze this hostility towards me
why do you think that is
maybe because they had one good part for a black man in this movie and they gave it to a white guy
put another way youre mad because i can act black better than you can
take it easy guys
to sandusky you better rein in black like me over here before i put a foot in his white ass
niggaz always got to be niggaz
this is truly over the line
redykulous lunges at lazarus
redykulous throws a wide punch that lazarus deftly avoids that hooks portnoy right in the jaw
sandusky jumps in and pries them apart
its not enough we have people shooting at us
now we have to kill each other
lets pull it together
this place is full of land mines
or doesnt anyones sense memory recall our director being blown up by onel
that shut them up
sandusky is right
we could all learn a little from his common sense approach
from now on we walk indian style footstep upon footstep
you take first position
he breaks off a branch and hands it to sandusky and pushes him out front
sandusky gives him a look
your bravery shames us
sandusky reluctantly starts down the path tapping for land mines with the branch
the guys follow at a very safe distance
jungle night am l u i i nhy close
on speedmans face
after a beat
a drop of water hits him in the
pull back to reveal a pathetic shelter made
out of headphone
wire and the in style magazine
the drip is now becoming full on rain
he clutches an equal packet and
the cherry chapstick
gently he puts the chapstick to his face and takes a tentative bite as though he were eating human flesh
he then tears open the equal packet and empties its contents into his hand
a lick savoring every granule
he hears a rustling in the bushes across from him
excited he pulls out his bowie knife and begins to stalk his prey
now another movement behind
the bush and a flash of
stealthily he moves towards it
with cat like quickness and knife drawn he lunges onto the bush a huge roar is heard
speedman is slashed something has got him in a choke hold
he reels around screaming
and stabbing wildly brutally pummeling his attacker
covered in blood but looks ecstatic
die you son of a bitch
speedman deals a death blow
and unleashes a primal victory scream
spent he finally gets a good look at his victim a
small cute cuddly panda
speedman looks horrified
i tropic thunder
flash on a series of stills from speedmans panda photo he stumbles back against a tree
suddenly we hear an odd vibrating sound
he jumps and frantically jams his hands in his pants it is the forgotten satellite phone he hid there way back when
rick is on a pilates machine in is office with a hot pilates instructor working him out
i got the personal attache of bien den phus ambassador to the united nations of america delivering a tivo directly to your bedroom
but the bad news is you gotta sit down and have monkey brains with him or some ceremonial shit for the local paper
i killed one rick
the thing i love more than anything in the world
you killed a hooker
calm down its fine
this is a no brainer
thank god youre out of the country
i killed a panda
heavy shit national park
take a breath

chill zone buddy im thinking
did anyone see you do this
i dont think so
im out in
listen to me
get your hands on some bleach some hydrogen peroxide and some lime
your gonna wanna cut the body in quarters
the femurs are gonna be a bitch
speedmannods eagerly absorbing it all not noticing a suddenly heis being choked
he drops the phone gasping for
its gonna be ok
im calling that publicist right now the one j lo hired when she washammered and killed that kid with her jetski
a guerilla shoots the phone
they quickly tie speedman
up and whisk himoff into the jungle
speedman is being led through the courtyard in shackles
he looks up to the guard towers
there are security cameras everywhere
in speedmans mind movie cameras
he nods into it
under his breath alright
bring it on dorf
cody is just coming to
four leaf is already at the slatted window watching
where are we
in a detention hut
and they got speedman
a guard shoves speedman hard with a rifle butt
speedman over acts the pain
cody gets up starting to freak out what
we gotta get outta here
are they gonna kill us
four leaf turns on him grabbing him with one of his hooks
pull it together private
shut your trap before you get us killed
you understand me lilydick
cody backs off still scared
speedman is in a windowless hut his feet and hands tied to a chair
there are security cameras in the corners of the room which speedman continually plays to
byong stands across from him watching him calmly
what were you doing in our poppy fields
who sent you here
corporal four leaf tayback
perhaps some hot tea will make conversing
a little easier
just thought you might like
corporal four leaf tayback
this is from my uncle
he head butts byong in the face
sending him reeling into the back wall
under his breath you
you leaned into it man
a pissed off byong and a couple of guards throw speedman into a small cage that is suspended by rope over the edge of a marsh
he looks around impressed with the production design
he looks up
sees another security camera observing him
he turns it on
may god protect you from the mighty arm of the st tropic thunder to the end
my men will seek you out and mete
out a cruel justice
byong and the guards look at him a bit confused
looking up we see a circle of faces
our guys looking down on something awful
that thing is tropic thunder
portnoy delirious and groaningt i think hes dead
a wet fart seeps out of portnoy
just smells like hens dead
smelled like that all night
whats wrong with him
probably just the beginning stages of some
more bad noises
if we can work out some rig to carry mi
i think it might subside in a little bit
no one touches him
sandusky looks up at him
is he serious
you and redykulous are gonna have to carry portnoy
god help you
he marches off
god help me
god help him that bitch ever find his blackface minstrel show ass alone with me in the real world
redykulous and sandusky shake their heads and gather up portnoy on a make shift stretcher
our guys are humping with fats in the makeshift stretcher
they look exhausted
as they crest
the ridge redykulous spots something
i i n n i n look
from behind sandusky grabs him and forces him to the ground
the guys hit the dirt
lazarus crawls up to join them
he pulls out his binoculars and surveys the scene
it is the flaming dragon compound
i knew it
prison camp day
oranges and lemons the bells of st
speedman was right
we are shooting the movie
sandusky grabs the binoculars and startslooking
to himself how could i be so stupid
i dont think so
looks to me like some sort of heroin processing plant
look at the cooking vats and the guards
sandusky continues looking through the binoculars
how do you know all this
it was a long trip
i read the in flight magazine
were in the golden triangle the biggest drug producer in the world
it is speedman who is being dipped in and out of the water in his bamboo cage while a bunch of guards stand around and laugh
whenever he comes up for air he is into the water then out what do you see
it doesnt look good
lazarus grabs the binoculars
sweet mother of jaysus
suddenly gunfire erupts all around
a band of guerillas have spotted them and are running at them firing automatic weapons
the guys scream and start a frantic retreat down the hill
portnoy suddenly gets well enough to run out of his stretcher for dear life
in fact he is actually beating them down the hill
when suddenly whump
he falls into a pit
redykulous stops and turns around and runs back to him heroically pulling him out
there is more fire coming all around
he gives up reverses tactics and starts kicking portnoy in the chest trying to kick him into the hole
what the fuck
he screams in pain
he disappears into thehole
redykulous whistles for the guys to join him and they all pile into the hole
they huddle trying to muffle their heavy breathing
the guerillas all frantically look around for the guys
no sign of them
one of them signals for them to keep moving
footsteps can be heard above leaving the area
sandusky lights a match
portnoy is weeping in pain
must be one of those underground tunnels
the cou ntr y is l itte red with them
je f f must have found one of the entrances
portnoy is on his side in pain whimpering
i think i took one in the ass
sandusky rolls him
over and off camera helps him remove his pants
all the guys recoil in horror
how did it get infected so fast
more ad libs of disgust
this is gonna hurt like hell but i have to take my finger and see how deep the slug is and if i can dig it out
take a breath
redykulous hold his hand
sandusky puts his hand off camera
what are you doing
cut it out
thats not the bullet hole
the bullet hole is over here
it dawns on the guys that they have not been looking at the bullet hole
ad libs of even more disgust
you just got grazed
youre gonna be fine
speedman is exhausted slumped in his cage
he is covered in a few leeches
byong appears with his usual cadre of guards
he nods and they grab speedman and drag him out of the cage
byong leads speedman to the center of the courtyard
a hush falls over the soldiers
they begin to part as someone very important is arriving
finally the unseen leader emerges
he is a little boy no older than years old but has the eyes of a killer
he smokes a cigar
this is tran
he stops in front of speedman staring him down
then in a show of alpha male dominance he tears his shirt off revealing an impressive set of gruesome tattoos a flaming dragon raping a monkey raping a skull raping
he holds a stick
i dont think i got the new pages
tran points across the courtyard where
a iv i
inm y cody and four leaf are marched out
cody looks scared out
of his mind
speedman takes this in
traci nods and two guards start to beat the bejeesus out of cody and four leaf
then tran gets out his own stick and starts to beat speedman
puh puh pulease dont h h h hurt them
i tran cocks his head curiously
he stops beating him
for the guards to stop beating the others
a long beat
please dont hurt them
like you did before
he threatens to hit him speedman recoils
puh puh puhlease dont h h hurt them
a hush falls over the crowd
louder to the crowd tropic thunder
speedman is now seated in a comfortable ornate chair though his feet and hands are still bound
tran and byong and a few cohorts stand across from him whispering
nyam nook snep jawk
excuse me what are you saying
nyam nook snep jawk
almost shyly you are simple jack
you saw simple jack
we love the tale of this man simple jack
tran snaps his fingers and an assistant shows speedman a battered vhs box of simple jack
speedman looks lovingly at it
we do not have many luxury here
simple jack is the only movie we possess
we have watched it many many times
how is the word
speedman smiles big
they smile back at him
its a small world after all
broken english you should have got oscar
i mean even just the nomination
you were nominated
no i mean it is great to
if you are or thats what i hear
its a popularity contest
its totally political you have to lobby for like a year for it
shut up now
ilia i n nmd my apologies for almost
beating you to death before
so are you going to let me go
we will hold
you for ransom
much more money now
he pulls out a cell phone
is it possible to
oh sure absolutely
speedman tries to throw an arm around tran a guard grabs the arm
and twists it back
speedman shrieks in pain
you mustnt touch me
the guard snaps the picture
that came out really good
the entire camp is assembled
guards lead speedman onto a platform behind tran
the people cheer some more
tran turns to speedman
now do the movie
do the movie
the whole movie
hey i know youre big fans and thats tran smacks speedman in the head with a rifle butt
speedman crumples to the ground
the crowd cheers
tran stands over him screaming into his face speedman gets up begins a scared unenthusiastic aww puh puh pa
whu why you guh got to muh muh make ffffffun of me
awww puh puh paaaa
tran turns to one of his men get him some overalls
and give him the simple jack haircut
sand asky slowly lifts his head out surveying the territory
it looks clear
he drops back down
the actors look miserable
like his face is going to fall off it looks clear but i cant be sure
i say we stay in here till its dark
i cant believe this is how it ends for redykulous
im a triple platinum recording artist
shivering and wheezing i gotta get back to the hotel
im not gonna make
that guard patrol knows were outhere
theyll be looking for us
anyway speedmans in that compound
and no one else knows but us
so heres the plan
everyone leans forward expectantly
we sneak out of here make our way back to the hotel and once were safe we alert the government of speedmans situation
whoa whoa whoa
so were just gonna leave him here
yeah and i dont wanna spend another minute getting the full on smello vision in this hole with his stinky ass
they start packing up
sandusky looks horrified
sandusky au ii wait
look i dont think ive met a more wildly self involved human than speedman but youre just gonna leave him here
i mean come on
hes a person guys
these drug lords are killers
i mean they eat their enemies
we leave him alone now he doesnt have a chance in hell
that tosser is in there because of his own stupidity
as far as im concerned he brought it on himself
besides how could we possibly rescue him
get real sandusky we dont know what the fuck we doing out here
weve gotten this far
look were making a movie about one of the greatest rescues ever
its a true story right
i mean those guys werent superheroes
they were just put in extra ordinary circumstances and they rose to the occasion
yeah but they were trained soldiers
they knew how to take care of themselves
and we dont
they believed they could do it
they believed in each other
look im not saying its gonna be easy
i mean some of us might not come back
you mean like not on the same flight
sandusky just looks at them
they know that is not what he meant
jeff i know this is really hard for you
abut youre gonna have to kick some time and it might as well be now
he turns to lazarus kirk ive always admired you as an actor
but as a person i have to say not that impressive
you got a
got any balls
lazarus takes this in
you talk a good game but hows it gonna feel when youre sipping cristalle with your homies
in the hot tub back in
cali knowing you left
a man to die back here
you gonna rhyme about that
there is a long beat
i only wish they was filming this for my show
he looks to lazarus
lazarus takes a long dramatic pause
with resolve we could fooster about for donkeys years
let s quit acting the maggot and nix that mentaller
the guys look at each other
what did that mean
peck squeezes a stressball as his hot young assistant comes in
chris michael is on the line
he hits a button chris
what is this craziness
its chris byong presses pause on a tape recorder hes holding up to chriss satellite phone
tran watches very serious
yes that was chris
but you will not speak with him again
and do not bother trying to trace this call
whats going on
who is this
we are flaming dragon
speedman is with us now
there is a long silence as rick processes this
then he nods slowly
well i never heard of your little agency
but if you wanna poach my client
lemme tell you something
his careers been in a death spiral since simple jack so why dont you all go fuck yourselves
oh and i bet he hasnt even told you about the whole panda thing
he killed a panda
and next time youre at a cocktail party with paris hilton or at kate mantellinis choking down some egg whites with ron howard dont let that slip because chances are
i already did
rick slams the phone down
byon g stares at the phone amazed
he looks to tran
up on the
are back up top watching speedman through binoculars
speedman is acting like simple jack with his new bad haircut
he is performing for a small group of chuckling
were too late
they brained him
redykulous grabs the binoculars
sees for himself
hes right man that aint right
messin with a mans brain
we gotta get him outta there
the guys have set up a camp with
a small fire
everyone watches as sandusky diagrams a plan in the dirt
heres the compound
heres where speedman was
it looks like they move him at night cause hes not here now
unfortunately we have no idea what the layout of that place is
sandusky contd but speedman does
if we can get in there and find him maybe he can help us sneak him out
sweating and in pain i got an idea
everyone turns to portnoy
it might be a little crazy but
crazy is better than nothin
what is it
intermittent pain noises back in i did a low budget titty comedy for skinemax sex camp
anyway me and the campers from the uncool camp had to break into the rich girls camp
so we did it by building a catapult
they shot us over the wall and we parachuted down
the guys all look at each other
then finally thats the stupidest idea ive ever heard
i say we wait till just before dawn and sneak over the fence
take our chances
you guys ok with that
the group nods in approval
then lets get some rest
me and redyk are on first watch
to lazarus ill wake you in two hours and well switch
they break up
portnoy comes up to sandusky extremely freaked out
im not gonna make it
yes you are
then you gotta tie me up
tie me to a tree
no matter how much i scream or however much i plead you
must not untie me
i will be cunning i will be in pain and iwill lie
the devil works this way
i will say do and excrete many regrettable things
no matter what
you must leave me alone
lazarus you heard him
tie him up
well get you through it
speedman has now been moved back to the cage
he is doing a late show for a crowd of toothless old women
a bodyguard plays a supporting female role he wears a mop for a wig
heav i l y accented eng l is h jack
i could never go to the county ho down with you
i would be laughed out of town
and what would chet say
the bodyguards laugh woodenly at speedman
b b b b but i am a g g g ggggoood dd d d d dancer
speedman bows exhausted and exhilarated
the old women politely applaud
a new group forms in front of his cage
he sighs and begins the movie over again
shu sure is a puh puh purty sssssssunrise uh uh uh uh aint it
go do your chores slowpoke
cody and four leaf watch through the slat in their window
l i i i
inti that poor bastard
looks like they coo coo nested him
so whats the plan
to get us out of here
come on man yoi lived this you gotta have an idea of how we can get out of here
four leaf looks a little at a loss
trying to be stoic sometimes the flowing stream can only move when
no offense but what the hell does that mean
it means im sick of your yappin
come on man you heard him back there
they wanna off us
we gotta escape
you four leaf suddenly puts his hook hand right up to codys neck
cody instinctively blocks it with his hand
i gotta what
take on the whole compound by myself
stop it man
youre chokin me
cody tries to push him away
they get into a wrestling match hand to hook
cody is pushing against four leaf
then four leaf tries to pull away
but cody holds on to his hooks
he holds on until
he pulls them off
two perfect hands
who the hell are you
four leaf looks down sheepishly
tied to a tree looking miserable and fidgety
we track past him to
redykulous who sit upright back to back leaning against one another
sandusky smokes a cigarette
its quiet except for the hum of cicadas and
the odd jungle noise
look at all those stars
makes a guy feel pretty small
back in la we dont get stars like this
i wonder why there are so many here
man how can you be talking about stars
we might not make it outta here tomorrow
i dont know
i give us pretty good odds
redykulous looks athis watch and lets out a chuckle
whats so funny
i cant feel my legs
im just thinking about lill kantankerous bitch
shes a rapper im producing a twelve year old girl
her first single drops tomorrow and im not even gonna be there to see it
theres barbed wire in my i pulled her off the streets six months ago
you did that
well not literally she was trapped in a dead end record deal with rick rubin
didnt even have a lawyer
and here i am on the other side of the world
about to die for a guy i barely even know
makes redykulous wonder whats it all about
well at least you have someone to think about
i got a girl
but its not too serious
i dont think were in love
its finally over
s kind of depressing
that feeling of not having anyone who really loves you
puts his arm around sandusky to comfort him
hey its cool
i think youre extremely lovable
removing his arm i mean like
i know what you mean
i have love problems myself
no you dont
what would the great redykulous know about girl problems
youre ten girls deep hours a day
thats the problem
how do you mean
make it stop
jeesus i cant believe im gonna tell you this
i like guys
i know impossible huh
thats what i say sometimes but its true
talk abort living a loveless life
at least you have someone who loves you
i dont even have that
the sound of giving birth
then when i think of the nights alone in my penthouse when ive longed for the gentle touch of another dude to feel his skin against mine or his sweet
breath on my face
all this from the same guy who wrote niggaz gotta bust a nut on a ho
yeah well let me let you in on a big secret
redykulous contd most of the time when im writing about hos in my songs i really mean niggaz
creatively thats the only way i can cope
youre also a great artist and businessman
why not rap about that
i u ia i
i jm yeah right
and watch my clothing line e i sports drink jewelry nutrition bars and fragrances go south
its all such a lie
now he begins to cry
sandusky embraces him
let it out
muffled crying in his if you tell anyone ill have someone shoot your
im not gonna tell anyone and your not gonna shoot me
th ats it
l et tout
redykulous pulls back and collects himself
sniff sniff i cant
believe its possibly the last day of my life and im not even gonna be able to let my fans know how truly utterly redykulous i really am
with total sincerity listen i know how utterly redykulous you are
even for just
and sometimes that enough
cody still awkwardly holding the hooks is yelling at four leaf
so all of tropic thunder is bullshit
four leaf and his men were real it happened
are you even a vet
i mean kinds
i served honorably in what they called the forced service
sanitation detail at the united states pentagon
so you were some two bit criminal who got caught and sentenced to clean toilets at the pentagon
i idolized you man
god dammit would you listen
i was a fuckup sure but one day as i was cleaning the office of some top brass big wig i came across a file headed for the shredder marked
it was four leaf taybacks file
killed in action
they were gonna bury the whole thing
total black op
so you decided to take his identity
i gave him one
i wrote the story and i gave the american people a hero
yes i am not technically four leaf but if i didnt pretend to be him then nobody woulda ever known who he was
see what im sayin
and you cashed in
i was a fuck up my whole life
this guy had a story worth telling and nobody woulda ever known
cody slumps in the corner looking spent and lost
im sorry man
im responsible for this whole mess
portnoy wakes up still tied to
the tree looking like shit
but realizes something that makes him ecstatic im clean
he struggles to his feet doing a celebratory dance
he immediately gets nauseous again and heaves
still sick but cheery my life
be gins today
pull back to reveal that it is on a piece of paper being pulled from a fax machine
the text below reads flamingg
dragon has speedman
lfyou want him the price is o million
theres a phone number below it

rick frowns at the fax
his hot assistant comes in
rick you better check your email
he punches up his email
he opens a video attachment

so far you have refused to give us the respect we asked for
maybe this will change your mind

he really knows how to handle a client
he hands the assistant the fax

byong looks impatient
the phone rings

there and i am going to jack you up
i am bringing the heavy artillery my friend so youd better be prepared for a blood bath
i am walking out of there with chris speedman whether you or he likes it or
rick slams down the phone enjoying himself
byong and tran are stunned
byong turns to his lieutenants
shandra get tech support to put a trace on this email attachment lets find out where this flaming dragon agency is
call the travel department
see if they got a nonstop to bien ben wherever the fuck it is
series of shots as the guerillas ready for an attack
the guys are suiting up for combat
they apply burnt cork to their faces for camouflage
this is it
you know what you need to do
tropic thunder on three two one
they make their way down the hill
they reach the fence
the coast looks clear and they each scamper over
finally its portnoys turn
hes clearly too heavy
the fence groans underhis weight
he launches himself and
slams painfully into the razor wire of the fence
guards hear the noise
they raise their weapons and listen
they see nothing in the pre dawn darkness
the actors run to the wall and clumsily pull portnoy down just in time
everyones inside the perimeter
they quickly make their way along the fence line to the entrance of the main building ducking away to avoid a lone guard
sandusky makes a series of hand gestures indicating for them tosplit up and search for speedman
the guys all shrug not understanding
sandusky repeats the hand gestures
finally he has to speak
i i in a loud whisper also signalling what
hes saying fan out
go room by room
if you see nci speedman give the signal
we follow portnoy working his wayldown a hall
he peaks around a half opened door
portnoy turns on his flashlight to reveal he is in fact in
wall to wall packets ready for shipment
portnoy is paralyzed
he spots a box with the words for u
pure dilute before ingesting
his mouth literally waters anda drop
spittle oozes from his bottom lip
he doesnt know what to do
he gently takes two handfuls of the heroin from the box
its like holding two grenades
sandusky moves silently toward a door
he kicks itopen to reveal
shackled to the floor
delirious he sits bolt upright
you mu mu make me ha aa ppy
oh sweet jesus
hold tight buddy
ill be right back
sandusky runs off to get the guys
sandusky rounds up redyk and lazarus points to both of his eyes signalling that hes got eyes on speedman
they take a step in that direction
redykulous stops them and makes a made up absurd signal for where is portnoy
somehow trying to mime looking for a fat guy
no one knbws what he is doing
where is portnoy
a muffled anguished animal noise that could only be portnoy emanates from a nearby door
they run towards it
redykulous kicks it in
the gang flies in to discover portnoy holding the bags crying
what are you doing man
come on lets go
we found speedmani i dont care
it doesnt matter what i do
ill always be a screw up
no one will ever respect me
thats not true
listen back in the day i used to think i couldnt produce a record simply because
thats not what redykulous was about to say
actually i was going to say poor
dont be crazy portnoy youre not a fuck up
youmake millions of people laugh
you said my farts made them laugh
leave me alone
that aint true portnoy
lotta people be fartin and not be gettin large a pop for it
two guards hear the noises inside head
in to check it out
the guys hear the guards enter the far side of the room
they cant see the guys through the
shelves packed with heroin packets
we need to go
no i cant do it
l ooking in the pac ket i need it
i need it
thisis all i deserve
come on man
the guards emerge
around a corner
they jab their rifles
at the guys and scream at them to put their hands the guys all slowly raise their hands
then in a moment of craziness portnoy charges the the guards let off a burst of machine gun fire as portnoy grinds it into their noses
they hear the fire
four leaf runs to the window
through it he sees the commotion
get me the hooks
portnoy watches as the white faced guards fall to their knees choking and groggy
after a beat they collapse
we got about sixteen hours before they wake up
they run out
the guys run in
redykulous breaks the lock off speedmans ankle with his rifle butt
sandusky keeps watch by the door
were busting you out
muh my nnnname is juh jack
some folks call muh me simple juh jack
whats wrong with him
i think he thinks hes simple jack
like from the movie
i was afraid of this
the same thing happened to me when i played neil armstrong in moonshot
they found me in an alley in burbank re entering the earths atmosphere in an old refrigerator box
i heard that movie was good
can you fix him
lazarus takes speedmans face in his hands forces him to look at him
youre chris michael speedman
ah likes pie
youre the greatest star in the world
theres a flicker of intelligence in speedmans eyes
four leaf wedges one of the hooks in the
door jamb and cody does the same with the other
in one fell swoop they bust
the door off its hinges
they emerge into the chaos
it is daylight now
a guard runs by four leaf uses the hook to trip him up
cody knocks him out and grabs his machine gun
he tosses the guards pistol to four leaf
by the way whats your name anyway
you ever been in this jungle
first time outta the states actually
he shoots off a round and they run for cover
lazarus is right in speedmans face
he seems to be getting clearer
the world needs you
it needs its stars
you make people forget how awful and i i ii i
m depressing their lives are
people love your work
i love your work too
speedman is quiet
uhhhh uh im
simple jack was magnificent
is it working
give me time sandusky
im not re programming a vcr
back to speedman you really committed yourself
and for that you deserved an oscar
speedman registers this
lazaruss own words make him stop and think
almost to himself you know who you are
you do chris
what am i doing
i cant do this
how can i convince a man he is who we know he is when i cant even convince myself of the same thing
he lets go of speedman and begins to break down
yo cmon man
why is everybody gettin
so insecure alla a sudden
youre kirk lazarus
youre like the greatest actor in the motherfuckin world
guys lets go we gotta get outta here
i it i
am i redykulous
am i just acting like thats who i am
the sad fact is
im not sergeant osiris
or father omalley
or neil armstrong
im not even
a beat i have no idea who i am
the guys look at him
its the first time he has let his guard down
kirk this is not the time
and i guess when you do themath
and boil it all down ive invented myself so many times
became so many people
that at the end of the
im bull s hit
y ou l isten to me
y ou a r e who you want to be and you have to own
look at me
im gay and im proud
he winks at sandusky
not what were called or who we pretend to be
we are what we are in our hearts
and to me looking into your heart youre a hero
lazarus looks to redykulous
you mean that
redykulous contd and one of the finest pieces of black ass i ever seen come out of belfast
from off camera
and ill second that
they allturn to see
the million dollar smile is back
now lets get the hell outta here
speedman leads the men to the door
sandusky tosses speedmana machine gun
you remembered my name
you gotta show us the way outta here chris
this time they do
the guys run toward the opening to the courtyard speedman leading the way
they huddle close to the wall unseen surveying the situation about guards on full alert
a jeep about feet away
beyond that a helipad with the compounds chopper maybe yards in the distance
thats their supply chopper
if we could create a diversion we could get to that jeep and drive it right over there
anybody here know how to fly a helicopter
cause that would come in handy too
you want a diversion
ill give you a diversion
is this baby loaded
he holds up the machine gun
and withthat speedman runs out in to the courtyard
the opposite direction from the jeep doing a crazy war a bunch of guards turns to see
he does a super macho tuck and roll landing perfectly and emptying his to
himself theyre blanks
there is a long moment of silence as the guards just stare at speedman
he seems a
bit surprised that
they are not dead
as do the guards themselves
they cock their weapons about to shoot him when
a hail of bullet fire erupts behind the gu ards
we reveal cody and four leaf behind them their lets move
guys jump into the jeep sandusky at the wheel and gun it
into the jeep as it passes by
they are speeding toward the helipad
but they cant break away they are trying to run toward the jeep but are under too much fire
sandusky swings the wheel hard
the jeep careens back toward the firefight
they come in hard and skid to a cody jumps in the jeep but four leaf doesnt
get in the jeep
i got real bullets
ill cover you
its the only way youll make it
marvin you gotta just go
sandusky looks at speedman
they both know hes right
leaving four leaf in the dust still firing
the jeep speeds up to the helipad
the guys jump out
just as the last guy is out
across the courtyard is tran
who just fired an rpg at our guys
the guys are freaked and shaken but start to get in the chopper
sandusky pushes cody in
start the chopper now cody
cody nods getting his bearings
and hitting the ignition
the blades slowly hum to life beginning to turn
portnoy grabs codys gun and hangs by the runner shooting towards approaching guards
tran is reloading his rpg
redyk and lazarus get
in and speedman grabs a live machine gun off the ground and fires toward tran and his men
cody reluctantly pulls up the throttle
begins to lift off
portnoy is not being heroic he is genuinely having trouble getting in
but then speedman sees something
speedman playing him in the beginning of the
arms extended his body riddled with bullets
cody lowers the chopper
speedman jumps out
speedman runs towards four leaf through a hailstorm of bullets
portnoy and the guys provide as much cover as i tropic thunder
speedman reaches four leaf and collapses beside him cradling his head
traps men continue to bear down on them
get outta here
im worm food you dig
then totally surprised you have hands
the guys are busy shooting off their attackers but they see this moment happening
the life is draining from four leaf marvin
i aint four leaf chris
were in this mess because of me
cant get over it how did you get hands
i aint never been worth a nothin
and its too late to start bein a somethin now
speedman tries to understand
he is welling up with emotion
you can tell the story
you have to tell the real story
and four leaf
speedman begins to weep
yes he is crying for real
lazarus caucasian again but looking alot like four leaf is now playing four leaf or marvin dead in speedmans arms
speedman sits in
the audience suirrounded by his tropic i i i
m thunder compatriots
everyone watches with rapt attention
dont you die on me
and his weeping continues
he then looks up
to see the audience applauds wildly
hilary swank opens the envelope at the podium
and the oscar goes to
chris michael speedman as himself in
playing hooky the audience erupts in applause
speedman gets up hugging redyk portnoy sandusky
even cody is there
as he gets near
the stage kirk lazarus caucasian but looking like his original self with his own oscar in hand bear hugs him
i tropic thunder
i ao this is chris michael speedmans first oscar
he joins four time oscar winner kirk lazarus tonights best supporting actor winner for the role of marvin kaminsky
and we freeze on speedman and lazarus grinning eat to ear arms around each other awards in hand
after a few moments
peck is tied up in ragged prisoner clothes hanging in the cage
he has been there a while
ok look you wanna go through this again lets do it
i see more for you than this
this whole big fish in the little scary jungle pond thing
i see you as a front man as a leader not just of this little rebel guerilla warrior group
i see it big picture
is it music is it movies
is it a series on fox
i dont know
but i do know it is not happening with you staring at me doing my i know why the caged bird sings routine for you and the peanut gallery for
another six months
its old school already
tran and some henchmen watch unamused
tran nods one of the henchmen turns a handle which lowers the cage into the water
after a moment it comes back up with a soaking peck
not missing a beat and it makes me sad to see you chomping on the stogie and youre not even fourteen or whatever
im thinking what hole does that need to fill that you have to keep dipping me into the water to somehow feel better about yourself
i can be a partner to you not just a captive
peck contd but you have to allow me into your inner workings into your headspace to facilitate that
and to do that you gotta let me outta the cage both figuratively and literally
until you can let me go i you
cant let you go
do you get that
he gets dunked in the water again
dare i bring up
a sore subject
can we do a little business on the blackberry privileges
cause youre killing me here
