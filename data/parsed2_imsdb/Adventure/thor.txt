written by ashley miller zack stentz on the blackness of space beautiful and mysterious strewn with a billion stars
atop a building a wrought iron sign a hammer wielding blacksmith spins listlessly in the wind as a swirling breeze kicks up
a hint of whats to come
a main street extends before us in this one horse town set amid endless flat arid scrubland
a large suv slowly moves down the street and heads out of town
the suv sits parked in the desert
suddenly the roof panels of the suv fold open
the underside of the panels house a variety of hand built astronomical devices which now point at the sky
jane foster late s pops her head through the roof
she positions a magnetometer so its monitor calibrates with the constellations above
it appears to be cobbled together from spare parts of other devices
we hear a loud bang followed by muffled cursing from below
jane offers a hand down to erik selvig who emerges as well rubbing his head
oh watch your head
so whats this anomaly of yours supposed to look like
its a little different each time
once it looked like i dont know melted stars pooling in a corner of the sky
but last week it was a rolling rainbow ribbon racing round orion
ive always said you should have been a poet
jane reigns in her excitement
she tries for dignity
th blue revisions a
pass up the bubbly and my gloves will you
intern darcy lewis hands jane a bottle of champagne and a pair of gloves through the window
jane passes it to selvig to hold while she pulls on the old gloves too large and masculine for her small hands
he starts to unwrap the foil and she stops his hand with an excited grin
not until you see it
re the gloves i recognize those
think how proud hed be to see you now
janes grin fades to a sad smile
the benefit of the doubt
the two stare out at the sky expectantly
a long beat while they scan the skies
th blue revisions
its never taken this long before
darcy calls up from the front seat
can i turn on the radio
an edge to her voice sure if you like rocking out to kfrm all agriculture all the time
worried jane heads back down into the vehicle
the suv is bathed in the glow of high tech monitoring equipment and laptops some looking like theyre held together with duct tape
jane opens a well worn notebook of handwritten notes and calculations
selvig watches the frustrated jane with sympathy
the anomalies are always precipitated by geomagnetic storms
she shows him a complicated chart shes drawn in the book tracking occurrences and patterns
the last seventeen occurrences have been predictable to the minute
i just dont understand
something catches darcys eye out the drivers side mirror
she adjusts it
in the distance odd glowing clouds form in the skies over the northeastern end of the desert
jane shushes her leafs through her notes
the bottle of champagne begins to vibrate
theres got to be some new variable
or an equipment malfunction
the lights and equipment in the suv begin to flicker around them
the computer monitors squelch with static
th blue revisions a
i dont think theres anything wrong with your equipment
the champagne bottle starts to rattle noisily now as it shakes more violently
jane and selvig notice
th blue revisions
they watch it curiously pressure building up inside it when the cork explodes out of it
champagne goes spewing everywhere over equipment over jane
i think you want to see this
darcy points out the window
jane and selvig look out
over the desert churn in the sky
the three stare dumbfounded
thats your subtle aurora
the roof panels still open the suv races towards the strange event jane amazed by the sight stands with half her body out the roof taking video of the light
storm before them
the suv hits a bump
jane nearly flies out
selvig grabs her yanks her back in
jane grins thrilled pumped with adrenaline
isnt this great
a thought strikes her
youre seeing it too right
im not crazy
put your seat belt on
th blue revisions a
the suv lurches
winds howl around the suv now
up ahead spiraling down from out of the clouds comes suffuse with the strange rainbow light roaring like a thousand freight trains as it touches down
th blue revisions
selvig looks up through the still open sunroof at the enormous glowing funnel cloud with wonder
jane clambers into the front seat beside darcy
she leans way out the window taping the storm
youve gotta get us closer so i can take a magnetic reading
then realizing oh god youre serious
you want those college credits or not
the suv tears across a field towards the tornado jane leaning out the window taping the event
the suv disturbs two ravens perched on a cactus as they race past
the birds take flight when krakaboom
a huge bolt of lightning strikes down through the center of the funnel cloud before them with a terrifying intensity
the suv rocks from the blast
darcys had enough
she turns the wheel starts to head away
keep the credits
ill intern at burger king
what are you doing
saving our lives
jane grabs the wheel jerks it hard the other way
they struggle for control when the headlights fall on th blue revisions
directly in their path stumbling through the winds
darcy slams on the brakes jane turns the wheel hard to avoid him
the suv swerves but too late
the side of the suv slams into the man with a thud sending him flying
the car skids to a stop
jane darcy and selvig trade shocked looks breathing hard
they peer through the dust clouds unable to see through
a paralyzed moment then they all leap out of the car
the three race from the suv with flashlights
jane spots the man lying on the ground
hes dressed in tattered clothing charred and blackened
i think that was legally your fault
get the first aid kit
darcy heads back inside the suv as jane concerned kneels next to the man
selvig hovers protectively
she gently turns his head to the light and we see him clearly for the first time
he is magnificently handsome long blonde hair flowing around his classically sculpted features
she cups her hands around his face as if willing the life back into him
come on big guy
do me a favor and dont be dead okay
open your eyes and look at me
suddenly he groans and shes startled then relieved as his eyes flutter open
she looks deep into his confused azure eyes which at last focus on her own
locking onto them
for a moment they each forget to breathe
the connection is broken as darcy returns with the kit
she freezes when she sees how gorgeous the man is
th blue revisions a
does he need cpr
because i know cpr
a flustered jane smooths her hair and sits back on her heels
she looks up at selvig
back to being a scientist
thats a good sign
we still have to get him to a hospital
after we get a reading on the storm
jane sighs and nods regretfully watching the storm evaporate above their heads
a thought strikes her
where did he come from
they exchange puzzled looks as we move up through the last glowing remnants of the storm and into earth spins slowly before us as we hear a voice deep and
resonant the voice of heimdall gatekeeper of asgard
questions theyve always asked questions this race called man on this planet they call earth
passionately longing to know how they are connected to the heavens
th blue revisions
we pull away from the planet widening past other worlds cosmic debris leaving first our solar system then our galaxy
in ages past they looked to us as gods for indeed so many times we saved them from calamity
we tried to show them how their world was but one of the nine realms of the cosmos linked to all others by the branches of yggdrasil
we pull back until we see it yggdrasil
immense sprawling like a quasar or a nebula twisted into the vague shape of a tree its branches of glowing energy stretching out into the black void of space
the worlds tree
nine realms in a universe of wonder beauty and terror that they barely comprehended
we move in through yggdrasil until we reach what looks like a galaxy slowly spinning before us
but for all their thirst for knowledge they let our lessons fall into myth and dreams
where did he come from
he came from us the proudest race of warriors the worlds have ever seen
he came from this the greatest realm the universe has ever known
we move through the galaxys mists and astral matter then over and up through a band of prismatic color to reveal whats on the other side he came
beautiful beyond imagination
we fly over the magnificent landscape of the realm through the gleaming capital city modern yet timeless
th blue revisions a
the palace rises countless stories tall gleaming with an other worldly majesty towering high above the realm sprawled out before it
we move towards a large window of the palace where a figure th blue revisions
stares out at his kingdom
the ravens fly up to the balcony land at his side
odin turns away from the window
his wife frigga sits at a vanity and tries different earrings before the mirror
do you think hes ready
he thinks he is
he has his fathers confidence
hell need his fathers wisdom
and his humility
thor wont be alone
loki will be at his side to give him counsel
have faith in your sons
yes but thors still a boy
he could be a great king
odin stops notices his hand shaking
it seems to be out of synch temporally with the rest of the world leaving a trail as it moves
he stares at it determinedly concentrating trying to stop the strange event through the force of his sheer will
th blue revisions
finally the occurrence subsides his hand normal once more
a worried frigga covers his hand with her own
if we only had more time
for once our son needs something we cannot provide
i can fight it a little longer
youve put it off too long
i worry for you
he touches her cheek
ive destroyed demons and monsters devastated whole worlds laid waste to mighty kingdoms and still you worry for me
now come kiss your king
while im still king
he pulls her close and they kiss
directly under the throne room a gloomily lit hall
banners hang on either side to form a corridor down the middle of the fire lit room
giant doors open at one end
a huge figure silhouetted against the bright light beyond walks forward
in slo mo we recognize the unmistakable shape of the god of thunder
hammer in hand he reaches the end of a raised platform
an attendant hands the figure a goblet of wine
he downs it quickly hurls it towards the fire directly below
th blue revisions a
the cup smashes the alcohol causes the fire to glow intensely and for a moment brightly lit and seen full length like a king to be is the mighty thor
he proceeds down stops past camera and down the center of the hall
we follow from behind and see at the other end massively shadowed on one of the great banners the shape of two great horns
as thor approaches the horn shapes move and then from the shadows at the side emerges loki wearing his horned headpiece
like thor he is dressed for a great ceremony
they stand by a brazier at the foot of steps that lead up to the crowded throne room
th blue revisions
have you ever known me to be nervous
there was the time in nornheim
that wasnt nerves brother
it was the rage of battle
how else could i have fought my way through a hundred warriors and pulled us out alive
the attendant approaches with another goblet of wine for thor
as i recall i was the one who veiled us in smoke to ease our escape
some do battle others just do tricks
the attendant stifles a laugh
loki notices doesnt like it
he gestures towards the goblet in the attendants hand
eels pour over the sides of the goblet slithering out and across the terrified attendants hand
he screams hurls the goblet to the ground
loki gestures to the writhing eels on the ground
they turn back to spilled wine the illusion shattered
now that was just a waste of good wine
just a bit of fun
to the attendant right my friend
the attendant isnt so sure
thor dons his eagle winged re thors helmet nice feathers
th blue revisions a
you dont really want to start this again do you cow
i was being sincere
youre incapable of sincerity
he looks his brother in the eye all pretense lost
ive looked forward to this day as long as you have
youre my brother and my friend
sometimes im envious but never doubt that i love you
th blue revisions
thor searches his brothers face sees no trace of irony
hes either speaking from his heart or hes a very very good liar
thor puts an appreciative hand on his brothers shoulder
the two brothers take in the moment a beat then give us a kiss
thor makes the final adjustments to his ceremonial wear
how do i look
like a king
they hear the blast of a ceremonial horn
you go ahead
loki casts him a wary look
ill be along
loki heads inside the palace without his brother
volstagg combs his great beard in preparation for the big event
as he does hes surprised to find a stray grape stuck in the beard
he pulls it out looks around then eagerly pops it into his mouth and gobbles it down
fandral checks his reflection in a mirror smooths out his moustache gives himself a dashing smile
a pretty maiden holds the mirror before him as other maidens look on dreamily
thank you love
to the maidens th blue revisions a
now whod like to polish my sword for me
the giddy maidens eagerly raise their hands
hogun stands staring ahead grimly his hands folded in front of him amidst the hustle and bustle of the attendants and the ceremony preparations going on around him
a helpful attendant approaches him and starts to polish his armor
hogun turns his head gives him a look
intimidated the attendant quickly backs away
from behind we see a woman in ceremonial armor take off her sword and set it on a table then her shield then several hidden daggers and small yet intimidating
we reveal that its sif looking radiant
she eyes the weapons on the table
to the weapons ill miss you
colorful ceremonial banners of the nine realms adorn the room crowded with aesir and representatives from across yggdrasil all buzzing with excitement
thors comrades enter and stride to their place of honor at the front of the hall
they are volstagg has the girth and strength of a sumo wrestler with oversized passions to match
fandral the consummate swashbuckler is agile charismatic and nattily dressed
hogun dark sullen brooding a large mace slung at his side
with them walks the warrior maiden sif
shes clad in armor a shield and sword at her side a beauty not to be trifled with
th blue revisions
i hope this goes quickly
are you attached to that pretty face of yours
because one more word and you wont be
to the others my we are hungry arent we
the others laugh save hogun
fandral turns to him
go on hogun
you can do it
even you hogun the grim
just one smile
hogun stares at him grimly
all right half a smile
look forget the smile just show some teeth
fandral is it true the famous warriors three are ready to meet any challenge
name it lady sif
keep your mouth shut
th blue revisions
imposing einherjar guards clad in armor swords at the ready stand watch inside the massive underground structure beneath the palace
a cold breeze blows past them
thor stands his fingers nervously drumming the handle of his hammer
frigga approaches behind him sees his anxiety
its all right to be nervous
why does everyone keep saying that
im not nervous
you may be able to fool the rest of but never you
thor just remember that you have something even the great allfather never had
and what is that
me for a mother
now dont keep your father waiting
sif and the warriors three still wait before the crowd
loki and frigga enter
loki takes his place at the front of the hall alongside the others
with another blast of the horn the crowd goes silent as the einherjar honor guard moves into formation
they part to reveal th blue revisions a
sitting atop his throne clad in full ceremonial armor
he holds his spear gungnir before him
any trace of weakness in him is gone now
he exudes all the power and majesty of a ruler of asgard
frigga joins him at his side
he looks around the hall casts a glance over to the warriors
thor is nowhere to be seen
odin looks to loki
odin isnt pleased
a murmur spreads through the crowd
sotto to loki where is he
he said hed be along
sif realizes the truth shakes her head in disapproval
he wants to make an entrance
well if he doesnt show up soon he shouldnt bother
odin looks like hes ready to feed him to his ravens
i wouldnt worry
father will forgive him
he always does
th blue revisions
just then at the back of the hall up the steps from the lower level roars up into the hall thor strides cockily into the hall behind it catching it
behind his back
the crowd erupts in cheers
thor spins his hammer with a flourish holds it up before the crowd basking in the moment relishing the adoration whipping his audience up into a frenzy
odin watches from the front not liking this showy display
as the sound of the cheers echo from above the odd cold breeze picks up in the vault
the guards rub their limbs to warm themselves
they grow increasingly uneasy sensing somethings not right
they exchange a look then walk the length of the vaults hallway to its end where a casket sits undisturbed upon a pedestal
large shadows suddenly loom over them
they look up and shout in terror as they raise their weapons
thor finishes stirring up the crowd then reaches the front of the room kneels on one knee before his mother and father
frigga casts him an admonishing glance
thor winks up at her
she cant help but smile
odin strikes gungnir upon the ground with a deafening boom
the crowd falls silent
odin speaks with quiet effortless authority
he raises gungnir before him
its aim is true its power strong
with it i have defended asgard and the lives of the innocent across the nine realms since the time of the great beginning
and though the day has come for a new king to wield his own weapon that duty remains the same
thor odinson my heir my first born
th blue revisions a
so long entrusted with this mighty hammer mjolnir
forged in the heart of a dying star from the sacred metal of uru
only one may lift it
only one is worthy
who wields this hammer commands the lightning and the storm
its power has no equal as a weapon to destroy or as a tool to build
it is a fit companion for a king
th blue revisions
the bodies of the guards are flung to the vaults floor now strewn with ice
we dont see their attackers clearly just catch glimpses of them in the shadows but they are large and blue skinned
one of the creatures lifts the casket off its stand and turns to go
but as they do the intricate latticework behind the casket starts to separate and retract revealing something standing in the shadows behind it
as the creatures walk away a fiery glow rises behind them
they turn back around
now its their turn to scream
the ceremony continues
today i entrust you with the greatest honor in all the nine realms
the sacred throne of asgard
i have sacrificed much to achieve peace
so too must a new generation sacrifice to maintain that peace
responsibility duty honor
these are not merely virtues to which we must aspire
they are essential to every soldier and to every king
the crowd and the warriors three start to shiver and rub their limbs for warmth in the increasingly cold air of the hall
thor turns back to face his father
odin looks upon his son with pride
th blue revisions
thor odinson do you swear to guard the nine realms
do you swear to preserve the peace
do you swear to cast aside all selfish ambition and pledge yourself only to the good of all the realms
then on this day i odin allfather proclaim you odin hesitates noticing a strange sight before him
ice creeps across the surface of the large banners around the hall making an eerie cracking sound
thor his comrades and the crowd see it too
the far off sounds of a battle echo in the depths of the palace below
sif and the warriors three reach for their weapons as thor races from the hall
th blue revisions
thor enters then stares shocked at the sight before him
sif the warriors three and loki hurry in behind thor and stop short
shattered and melting ice is strewn about the floor
we dont see the blue skinned bodies of the frost giants clearly just catch glimpses of their twisted and smoldering remains on the floor
theyve just lost a savage battle
amidst them shrouded in shadow stands the black metal creature a fiery glow coming from within it
it is the destroyer
it holds the casket in its hands
i thought it was but a legend
odin steps in behind the asgardians as the destroyer sets the casket back on its pedestal
it moves back to its post the faint fiery glow extinguishes within it
fandral looks around the vault ill at ease
ive never been inside the vault before
its said the tesseract was once held here
i thought that was but a legend too
odin surveys the destruction
the jotuns must pay for what theyve done
th blue revisions a
they have paid with their lives
the destroyer did its job and the casket is safe
all is well
all is well
they broke into the weapons vault
if the frost giants had stolen even one of these but they didnt
i want to know why they the casket of ancient winters belonged to the jotuns
they believe its their birthright
and if you hadnt taken it from them they would have laid waste to all the nine realms
i have a truce with laufey the jotun king
he just broke your truce
we must act
odin turns to sif and the warriors three
thors comrades exit
odin eyes thor as loki watches
and what action would you take
march into jotunheim as you once did teach them a lesson break their spirits so theyll never dare try to cross our borders again
youre thinking only as a warrior
th blue revisions b
this was an act of war
it was the act of but a few doomed to fail
they got this far
we will find the breach in our defenses
it will be found and it will be sealed
th blue revisions
as king of asgard i would you are not king
thor sees in his fathers face that hes pushed this as far as he can
he backs away then leaves pushing through the doors so hard that they slam backwards behind him
odin watches him go
thor stands in the empty hall bearing the signs of the festivities cancelled due to the events of the day
anger and frustration rising within him thor upends one of the massive tables
from across the room loki watches him
sif fandral and hogun follow volstagg as he enters in search of his dinner
redecorating are we
volstagg surveys the overturned tables and food aghast
i told you theyd cancel it
we thought that was just you being your normal cheery self
volstagg looks about the floor despairing
all this food so innocent cast to the ground
it breaks the heart
thor strides away from them to the far end of the hall
loki calmly moves towards him
its unwise to be in my company right now brother
th blue revisions
who said i was wise
re the empty hall this was to be my day of triumph
it will come
if its any consolation i think youre right
about the frost giants about laufey everything
if a few of them could penetrate the defenses of asgard once whos to say they wont try again
next time with an army
but theres nothing we can do without defying father
thor considers this looks at his hammer a gleam in his eye
loki can guess what hes thinking grows concerned
i know that look
its the only way to ensure the safety of our borders
what sort of madness
thor was making a jest
the safety of our realm is no jest
were going to jotunheim
th blue revisions
thor of all the laws of asgard this is one you must not break
loki looks on intrigued by the proceedings
this isnt like a journey to earth where you summon a little lightning and thunder and the mortals worship you as a god
this is jotunheim
and if the frost giants dont kill you your father will
my father fought his way into jotunheim defeated their armies and took their casket
wed just be looking for answers
it is forbidden
thor sizes up his friends smiles
he proceeds to make his case with enthusiasm and charismatic conviction
my friends have you forgotten all that weve done together
he turns to fandral
who brought you into the sweet embrace of the most exotic maidens in all of yggdrasil
who led you into the most glorious of battles
and to delicacies so succulent you thought youd died and gone to valhalla
th blue revisions a
he turns to sif
and who proved wrong all who scoffed at the idea that a young maiden could be one of the fiercest warriors this realm has ever known
but i supported you
then to the others my friends trust me now
we must do this
the others exchange concerned looks realize theres no convincing him
youre not going to let my brother and me take all the glory are you
loki looks startled
you are coming with me
yes of course
i wont let my brother march into jotunheim alone
i will be at his side
th blue revisions
the warriors three fight together
i fear well live to regret this
if were lucky
thor sif loki and the warriors three walk from the palace across the grounds
they reach a group of attendants who ready their battle gear for their journey
loki slips away from the group speaks to a nearby guard
we must first find a way to get past heimdall
that will be no easy task
its said the gatekeeper can see a single dew drop fall from a blade of grass a thousand worlds away
and he can hear a cricket passing gas in niffelheim
he heareth all
getting past him should be simple enough now since he seems to be letting frost giants sneak by under his nose
volstagg terrified calls out to the sky
he meaneth no offense
loki rejoins the group as thor leads them onward
th blue revisions a
thor and his band of adventurers on horseback pass through the massive gate leaving asgard behind
they ride along the most astounding path in this realm or any other th blue revisions
wide and flat it runs straight out from odins palace to the mists and black void of space beyond
in the distance far ahead the bridge continues on until it reaches heimdalls observatory
the band draws near the observatory where heimdall himself gatekeeper of asgard stands at his post on the bridge before them blocking their way staring them down
there is something other worldly about him even for this realm
he holds a massive sword in front of him his stern intimidating face virtually concealed by armor
something glints beneath his visor like twinkling stars
keep your weapons sheathed and your mouths closed
this is going to take subtlety and sincerity not brute strength
leave it to me
loki dismounts and steps forward
youre not dressed warmly enough
thor loki and the others trade looks
the freezing cold of jotunheim
it will kill you all in time even thor
you think you can deceive me
i who watch all
i who can sense the flapping of a butterflys wings a thousand worlds away
he fixes his eyes pointedly at fandral
or can hear a cricket passing gas in niffelheim
fandral looks gob smacked
th blue revisions
that was just a bit of a jest really
loki goes into damage control
you must be mistaken
were not enough
heimdall may we pass
heimdall stares him down
for ages have i guarded asgard and kept it safe from those who would do it harm
in all that time never has an enemy slipped by my watch until this day
i wish to know how that happened
then tell no one where weve gone until weve returned
thor walks past heimdall as the gatekeeper lets the group pass
volstagg walks beside the frustrated loki needles him
your silver tongue turn to lead
get me off this bridge before it cracks under your girth
volstagg and fandral share a laugh
thor and the others enter the observatory step onto a platform
heimdall climbs into the large control apparatus at the center of the room and readies the observatory
th blue revisions
i will honor my sworn oath to protect this realm as its gatekeeper
if your return threatens the safety of asgard bifrost will remain closed to you
youll be left to die in the cold wastes of jotunheim
i have no plans to die today
heimdall inserts his sword into the control panel and the apparatus of the observatory starts up
the bifrost energy quickens along the bridge feeding into the observatory
heimdall turns his sword in the control panel
the observatorys giant turret swings around aims toward a section of space
as a final step heimdall plunges his sword deeper into the control panel
the great turret fires the rainbow light of bifrost energy blasts out of it
the bifrost opens at the end of the platform upon which thor and his five comrades stand
all is ready
you may pass
couldnt you just leave the bridge open for us
to keep this bridge open would unleash the full power of the bifrost and destroy jotunheim with you upon it
never mind then
thor starts towards the bifrost turns back to the others grins
th blue revisions a
dont be bashful
the others join him at his side then step towards the bifrost
their bodies stretch towards the maelstrom changing shape as if every atom of their being is being elongated by the pull of it
in an instant theyre jerked off the platform and inside the vortex
a hole in the sky rips open and the bifrost comes shooting out of it
snow flurries up when the bifrost hits as thor and his band touch down
runes from the bifrost are imprinted on the ice around them
th blue revisions
volstagg loses his footing falling backwards
thor quickly grabs him by the belt
we see the warrior dangling precariously on the edge of a sheer cliff on the planets inner ring opening up to the black abyss of space beyond
come on big fella
with an effort thor pulls the burly warrior back onto the ice and tremendously relieved he proclaims this belt
this belt is now my lucky belt
i will never remove it
even when bathing
thor and the others turn and stare out in horror and wonder at the frozen alien wasteland before them
the whole planet is a massive flattened ring of jagged ice slowly breaking apart
huge chunks of ice calve away from its outer edges and float off into space
the planets icy surface cracks and melts as far as the eye can see
the ruins of a jotun city lies in the distance
we shouldnt be here
too late now
actually its not
we could turn right around hop back to asgard share a mug by the fire
could be nice
thor ignore him heads off
loki looks around anxious
perhaps we should wait
thor turns back to his brother
to survey the enemy
to gauge their strengths and weaknesses from a distance
th blue revisions
im liking that
particularly the distance part
we know all we must
its time to act
thor heads on
reluctantly the others follow
hes just got to swing his hammer
the group trudges behind thor across the frozen wasteland shielding themselves from the howling wind and cold
loki looks around them anxious
thor invigorated turns back to his comrades
it feels good doesnt it
to be together again adventuring on another world
is that what were doing
what would you call it
how about a song to lift our spirits
the others groan
no not that
th blue revisions a
please dont make us sing again
if i have to listen to volstaggs singing voice one more time ill fall on my own sword
well now im on board
she and thor share a grin
the party reaches the edge of the city its ancient structures of jade and ice melting and crumbling ravaged by warfare long ago
a temple lies before them across a central plaza
where are they
as cowards always do
thor leads the others onwards towards the central plaza
loki reluctantly follows
they dont notice as shadowy figures move in the shadows of the structures nearby
the party reaches the plaza
they sense the frost giants in the shadows and crevices surrounding them now on all sides
the asgardians reach for the hilts of their weapons
a jotun sentry calls to him
what is your business here asgardian
the jotuns voice itself sounds like cracking ice
th blue revisions
i speak only to your king
not to his foot soldiers
thor turns towards the source in a balcony of the temple where laufey sits veiled in shadow behind a cascading waterfall
the jotun king is ancient noble powerful too proud to reveal even a hint of the years of suffering he and his people have endured
i am laufey king of this realm
and i am we know who you are odinson
why have you brought the stench of your blood into my world
i demand answers
laufey stands sizing up thor tries to piece this together
how did your people get into asgard
the house of odin is full of traitors
sif and the warriors three exchange a puzzled look disturbed by the jotun kings words
do not dishonor my fathers name with your lies
your father is a murderer and a thief
he stole what was ours and left our world in ruins
we have the right to reclaim the casket
th blue revisions
not when youd use it to make war against other realms
laufey laughs cold mocking
and why have you come here
to make peace
you long for battle
you crave it
i see you for what you are thor odinson
nothing but a boy trying to prove himself a man
this boy has grown tired of your mockery
thor takes a step towards laufey
the other jotuns step in front of thor blocking his path
we finally see the frost giants now terrifying blue skinned standing eight feet tall
loki moves next to his brother and quietly implores him
thor stop and think
look around you
we are outnumbered
know your place brother
you should listen to his counsel
you know not what your actions would unleash
laufey steps out of the shadows
but i do
go now while i still allow it
loki speaks up
we will accept your most gracious offer
the others look to thor imploringly
thor stares laufey down a beat then relents
he turns to leave
his comrades breathe a sigh of relief and follow when a frost giant nearby mutters under his breath
th blue revisions
run back home little princess
thor stops in his tracks
loki goes white
he knows whats coming
in one quick move thor pulls mjolnir swings it and knocks the jotun clear across the plaza
the asgardians reluctantly draw their weapons gather into a circle around thor
volstagg looks around at the angry jotuns approaching them
has a mind of its own
ice forms on the jotuns bodies creating a frozen armor around them extending off the ends of their arms like swords
one giant does so directly in front of fandral
im hoping thats just decorative
thor leaves the circle of asgardians swings at another frost giant
his comrades form another circle around him separating him from the jotuns as he whirls his hammer around once and catches it with a cocky grin
hes enjoying this
fandral calls to volstagg and hogun
what move do you think
i say we use the norns revenge
at this close range
i think the alfheim lunge is a better move
maybe if they were three feet tall
how about the randy valkyrie
th blue revisions a
thor takes out yet another frost giant then all hell breaks loose as the asgardians and jotuns begin to battle
a jotun backs hogun up against a wall of ice
as the giant hurls an ice blade fist at him the grim warrior swings his mace over his head embedding it into the ice wall and hoists himself up dodging
the giants blow and leaping over him
hogun takes out a second approaching frost giant spins back dodges a swing from the first then pounds the jotun with his mace
nearby sif expertly stabs one jotun after another with her double bladed staff
one knocks her viciously to the ground
if you dont treat me like a lady i wont act like a lady
she takes out the jotun
loki backs away from an approaching jotun finds himself at the edge of a deep crevasse
the giant sees hes vulnerable swipes at him
but the jotuns arm passes right through him
the giant stands there confused when the real loki comes out from behind a structure and shoves the giant into the crevasse below
the false loki dissipates into nothingness
to the falling giant pathetic
he turns back to the battle
two jotuns come at him from either side
he lets two daggers fly felling both giants at once
laufey nods to one of his guards a massive jotun brute
the brute leaps down from the balcony icing himself up then punches his giant fist into the ice beneath his feet
its a long range attack causing pillars of ice to explode out in front of hogun sending the grim warrior flying back
across the plaza thor easily dispatches some jotuns
at least make it a challenge for me
he sees the brute coming at him
the huge jotun lands a tremendous blow sending thor back across the ice
thor rises grins
th blue revisions b
now thats more like it
he throws mjolnir with all his strength knocking the brute head over heels
thor raises his hand
mjolnir slows in mid air then flies back to his grasp
re the fallen brute ugly and stupid
sif takes out a couple frost giants but shes knocked to the ground by another
it raises its weapon above her
hogun sees sif in danger
he pulls a hidden knife from his sleeve and hurls it at sifs attacker hitting him square in the chest
the jotun falls dead
to hogun re knife im so glad i taught him how to do that
volstagg grapples with a frost giant getting a couple good hits in
you may want to put some ice on that
the frost giant fights back but volstagg manages to grip in a headlock just as another comes up on him from behind
volstagg fends him off then turns the first one loose
you may be taller but im wider
volstagg launches his mighty belly at the jotun and sends him flying
another jotun grabs volstagg squeezing him tightly and sending him crashing to the ground
its not too late for you to surrender
volstagg recovers and fights on
the jotun grabs volstaggs bare arm
the warriors skin begins to freeze from the jotuns grasp a blackness spreading from it necrotizing volstaggs flesh
the warrior shouts in pain
th blue revisions c
volstagg head butts the frost giant shattering the jotuns ice helmet and dropping him to the ground
winded he takes a seat upon one of the fallen jotuns bodies to catch his breath
as the battle rages around him he opens a secret compartment at the end of his weapon takes out a small flask
volstagg grimaces in pain sees his blackened skin
he yells to his comrades
dont let them grab hold of you
he takes a swig enjoying the brief respite then rejoins the battle
volstagg stabs his blade in a giants chest but the sword stops mid ice layer
the giant delivers a bone breaking blow to volstaggs face and the warrior drops to one knee
sif sees volstagg in trouble and rushes towards him
in one quick move she leaps up and off of volstaggs back using her boot to plunge volstaggs blade deep into the giants chest standing atop him as he falls
backwards to the ground
on his belly thank you my lady
but i nearly had him
of course you did
nearby a frost giant forms a barrage of ice bullets hurling them at sif
sif raises her shield barely in time as the bullets go pinging and ricocheting off it
she races into the group of frost giants who attacked her and takes them out
th blue revisions
a frost giant touches a pool of standing water
it flash freezes hoguns feet to the ground
volstagg notices hurries over dispatching jotuns as he goes
volstagg swings his weapon wildly hacking at the ice around hoguns legs to free him
hogun looks down suddenly worried as volstaggs blade cuts deep and perilously close to hacking into hoguns legs
watch the legs
volstagg chips away at the ice more carefully finally freeing hoguns feet
fandral sword fights with a frost giant
you really think your icicles are a match for asgardian steel
fandral lunges at the giant
the jotun knocks his blade away
fandral moves on him again but the giant grabs fandrals sword and snaps it in half
could we stop just a moment while i get another sword
fandral fights the giant with his broken sword
the jotun then lunges at fandral who ducks just in time grabs hold of the giants sword and redirects it stabbing the giant through with his own weapon
the jotun staggers back then reaches down and swipes at a pool of water sending up a spray that freezes in mid air forming into an ice stalagmite
it impales fandral rendering him helpless
th blue revisions a
loki races towards the impaled fandral throwing daggers and felling frost giants as he goes
he reaches the nearly unconscious warrior when other jotuns approach
he fights them off
volstagg looks across the plaza and sees the impaled fandral
he hurries to his wounded comrade
i may need a bit of help
not a good look is it
just try not to bleed
hows the face
volstagg begins to pull the bleeding fandral off the ice stalagmite
loki plunges two daggers into the chest of one of the frost giants
the giant grabs hold of lokis gloved wrists
loki pulls his hands free of the gloves which are still in the giants grasp revealing lokis skin beneath
the wounded jotun sees his chance grabs hold of lokis bare arm
loki looks at his arm prepared for the worst
but instead of the blackness of necrotizing flesh lokis arm turns blue like the frost giants own skin
the blueness spreads painlessly up lokis arm
he stares at it confused
the frost giant is thrown as well distracted by the unexpected phenomenon
loki takes advantage of the distraction kicks the giant
th blue revisions
thor continues fighting his blood lust rising
he taunts the jotuns around him
but when he hurls his hammer to take out a jotun the frost giants seize the opportunity
a group of jotuns swarm thor from all sides keeping him separate from his weapon
mjolnir falls to the ground
a frost giant desperately struggles to lift mjolnir off the ground to no avail
now free the wounded fandral looks relieved as volstagg slings him over his shoulder and the warriors start to leave
from his balcony laufey looks upon the battlefield decides its time to pull out the big guns
he touches a wall of the palace
an energy wave sweeps from his touch across the wall of the palace and down to the ground below
the asgardians hear a foreboding crack of ice below their feet
that cant be good
yes it could
might be an early spring
they look down suddenly filled with dread when they see shadowy figures moving in the ice dozens of jotun warriors awakening beneath the surface rousing to join the battle
loki turns to his brother who battles a group of the giants
th blue revisions
thor we must go
thor still without his hammer fights his jotun foes mercilessly a man consumed by blood lust
loki sees the look on his brothers face the savage thrill of the heat of battle
there are too many of them
i can stop them
the others hesitate
jotuns break up through the ice all around them
but thor ignores his comrades continues fighting
reluctantly the group flees back toward the inner edge of the planet as the giants break up through the ice and give chase
thor battles valiantly but theres just too many of them
the frost giants swarm him from all sides now as he disappears beneath a pile of blue flesh and ice
after a forces its way up through the middle of the pile of jotuns
he opens his hand beckoning
one of thors attackers hears something roaring up behind him
he whirls around bam
mjolnir nails him square in the face then flies into thors outstretched hand
thor raises the hammer up high and brings it down on the ground with all his might
lightning strikes down from the sky the hammer channeling the blast firing the electricity out at the jotuns around him
theyre blasted back in a massive shockwave
the jotuns convulse drop dead to the ground
th blue revisions
but the force of the blast also cracks the ice below the shockwave continuing to spread outwards
it moves out to where his comrades are running breaking up the ground beneath them exposing the black void of space below
whats thor done
likely killed us all
as the jotuns race towards the asgardians they open their mouths wide and breathe out an icy fog
the swirling mists quickly engulf the fleeing asgardians before them
the asgardians stand in the mist unable to see
hogun takes a step back the ice cracking beneath him
they dare not move for fear of falling through into the void below
thor sees hes put his friends in even greater danger
he raises mjolnir high summoning the winds
they lift him off the ground and carry him across the frozen wasteland to his comrades
thor lands beside his comrades in the shroud of mists
loki we have to see
loki raises his arms concentrates the mists dissipating
but as they do the asgardians see before them the faces of the frost giants
and there are hundreds of them too many even for a thunder god
actually could you bring the mists back please
thor realizes that he and his comrades are as good as dead
the giants move in for the kill when they hear a deafening roar
a hole in the sky opens up and the bifrost blasts down onto the inner edge of the planet
out of the maelstrom comes the sound of thundering hooves and to the shock of all tearing across the frozen wasteland comes astride his powerful eight legged steed sleipnir
hes clad in battle armor gungnir in his hand an imposing sight
th blue revisions a
the giants part in fear as he thunders into their ranks stopping before laufey and the asgardians
laufey slams his fists into the ground and the ice beneath his feet raises him towards odin
the asgardians start to react thinking its an attack but laufey just stands face to face with odin
asgardian and jotun alike look on uneasily unsure whats about to happen
laufey sizes up odin notices that as powerful as the allfather still is the years have taken their toll
hes not the foe he once was
the two rulers talk quietly out of earshot of the others
your boy sought this out
th blue revisions
these are the actions of a boy
treat them as such
you and i can stop this before theres further bloodshed
unseen by odin and the others laufey starts to form an ice blade at the end of his arm
we are beyond diplomacy now allfather
hell get what he came for war and death
odin looks grim determined
so be it
without warning laufey swings his ice blade at odin but odin is quicker
the allfather brings his spear down upon the ice
laufey and the nearest jotuns go falling backwards in a wave the ice cracking beneath their feet
the other frost giants turn tail and run
thor watches the fleeing jotuns with delight
well finish them together
odin raises his spear
the hole in the sky opens the bifrost energy blasting forth from it
the bifrost envelops the asgardians yanks them off the ground and up through the hole
the vortex closes behind them as all falls silent
laufey stares up after them contemptuously
heimdall stands at the observatory controls
odin pulls heimdalls sword from the control panel and throws it to him
heimdall backs away
why did you bring us back
do you realize what youve done
what youve started
th blue revisions a
i was protecting my home
th blue revisions
you cannot protect your friends
how can you hope to protect a kingdom
odin turns to the others
get him to the healing room
sif volstagg and hogun hurry to help fandral out of the room
there wont be a kingdom to protect if youre afraid to act
odin stares at him
whatever the cost the world must know that the new king of asgard will not be held in contempt
thats pride and vanity that talks
have you forgotten everything ive taught you
what of a warriors patience cunning
while you wait and be patient the nine realms laugh at us
the old ways are done
youd stand giving speeches while asgard falls
youre a vain greedy cruel boy
and you are an old man and a fool
the whole world seems to stop at thors words
odin falls quiet
when he speaks again theres something terrifying beneath the calmness of his words
a fool yes
i was a fool to think you were ready
loki takes a step towards odin imploringly
th blue revisions a
odin turns and gives loki a look which stops him in his tracks
th blue revisions
you have disobeyed the express command of your king
through your arrogance and stupidity you have opened these peaceful realms and innocent lives to the horrors of war
the allfather plunges gungnir into observatorys control panel
the turret turns the bifrost energy building along with odins rage
it fires as the bifrost opens at the end of the platform creating a portal behind thor
odin turns angrily to his son
you are unworthy of this realm
odin rips a disc off thors chest
unworthy of your title
he rips away thors cloak
unworthy of the loved ones youve betrayed
i hereby take from you your powers
odin extends his hand towards his son
mjolnir goes flying from thors grasp into odins hand
in the name of my father
a finger of lightning comes off the hammer and hits thor disintegrating the right arm of his armor and part of the chest piece
and of his father before
another strike disintegrates the remainder of thors armor including the cape and torn away disc on the floor
i cast you out
odin thrusts mjolnir before him and with a crack of thunder thor is hurled backwards into the open bifrost and disappears in the vortex
th blue revisions a
odin holds mjolnir in his hand stares at it bitterly
he closes his eyes lost in contemplation whispers something quietly
whosoever holds this hammer if he be worthy shall possess the power of thor
runes appear on the side of the hammer as if carved into its smooth surface
the runes linger for but a moment then disappear
suddenly odin turns and hurls the hammer into the bifrost
thor opens his eyes surrounded by darkness
suddenly hes blinded by bright headlights of a vehicle an suv
it swerves the side of it coming straight at him
it slams into him as we th blue revisions
after a beat we hear familiar voices
i think that was legally your fault
get the first aid kit
come on big guy
do me a favor and dont be dead okay
open your eyes and look at me
thor opens his eyes to see jane foster staring at him concerned
she looks vulnerable and beautiful
does he need cpr
because i know cpr
jane regretfully watches the storm evaporate above their heads
a thought strikes her
where did he come from
they exchange puzzled looks when thor groans again
he sits up abruptly and jane topples backwards in surprise
thor staggers groggily to his feet then turns and offers jane a hand up
she takes it hesitantly and he easily pulls her up
she cant help but marvel at his strength
are you okay
thor searches the ground
yeah we can tell youre hammered
thats pretty obvious
jane notices something on the ground around them
she shines her flashlight down at the sand
th blue revisions a
look at this
he joins her at her side and sees it
a faint discernible pattern is etched into the sand
they exchange a look
amazed and excited jane hurriedly takes out a camera and snaps some photos of the runes
a breeze begins to blow them away
weve got to move fast before anything changes
th blue revisions
we need soil samples light readings everything
she pulls out a light meter holds it up takes some readings jots them down in her notebook
selvig looks at thor who stares up at the sky
jane we need get him to a hospital
jane kneels and quickly scoops up a soil sample in the cannister
not right now
itll take too long
countys an hour away
well drop him off after were done here
selvig looks uncertain
look at him hes fine
thor stares up at the stars shouts up at them angrily
i know you can hear me
open the bridge
off selvigs look okay you and darcy take him to the hospital ill stay here
you expect me to leave you alone in the middle of the desert
thor turns to the others frustrated
what world is this
the group is intimidated by his fervor
its all right my friend
were going to get you some help
selvig touches thors shoulder
thor shoves him off grows agitated belligerent
th blue revisions a
where am i
darcy reaches into her fanny pack pulls something out of it
jane looks on concerned
th blue revisions
erik just back away
to thor calming youre in the desert outside the town of puente antiguo
darcy raises a taser at him
thor looks at the weapon unsure what to make of it
you dare threaten thor with so puny darcy fires the electrified wires shooting out of the taser zapping him in the chest
thor convulses falls to the ground unconscious
jane and selvig stare at her shocked
he was freaking me out
as jane still takes soil samples darcy and selvig struggle to drag an unconscious thor to the suv and lift him inside
next time you decide to taser someone do me a favor and make sure theyre already inside the truck
jane come on
reluctantly jane joins the others inside the suv
the suv heads off into the distance
behind it high overhead a hole opens in the sky
a last blast of bifrost energy bursts forth from it and a small object comes firing into our world
it burns across the desert sky like a meteor
th blue revisions
the suv sits parked before the emergency room entrance
selvig watches the unconscious thor with interest as two orderlies set the asgardian onto a gurney
jane and darcy stand before a sweet ditzy admissions nurse
he said it was thor
the nurse painstakingly types it into the computer one key at a time
jane watches as thor is wheeled out of the room
t h o r
and your relationship to him
ive never met him before
until she hit him with the car
grazed him actually
oh and we tasered him too
must have been quite the spat
i told you i dont know him
i just want to make sure hes okay
im going to need a name and contact number
th blue revisions a
oh for gods sake
he reaches over janes shoulder and hands the nurse his business card
selvig darcy and jane head out
th blue revisions
thor now in a hospital gown winces in pain as he awakens on a gurney to find a nurse standing over him a syringe in his arm
just taking a little blood
thor slaps the syringe away angrily starts to sit up
how dare you attack the son of odin
i need some help
two orderlies race over try to hold thor down
were trying to help you
then bring me a healing stone you savages
he hurls one of them off smashing against a wall
now a couple security guards and male nurses join the fracas all struggling to hold thor down
medical equipment goes flying furniture overturned
what the hell is this guy on
finally they force him back down onto the gurney
thor looks shocked and amazed that hes actually being overpowered by this small group
the nurse injects him with a sedative
youre no match for the mighty thor struggles a beat then passes out
smoke rises from a fifty foot wide crater
a townie pulls his pick up to a stop at the craters edge
he climbs out peers down below his curiosity piqued by what he sees
th blue revisions a
the townie approaches something at the center of the crater
we dont see what it is but it bathes him in an otherworldly blue luminous glow
he reaches for the object tries to lift it but cant
he redoubles his efforts strains with all his might with no luck
he takes off his hat fans himself stares at the mysterious object
th blue revisions
the distant mountains glint snow in the early morning light
selvig appears with a cup of coffee and surveys the vast desert
he turns back into the lab and sees jane busy at her workstation soldering a piece of equipment
a printer churns out blown up screen cap photos of the bifrost footage
darcy hangs them on the wall
selvig surveys the scene watches how jane works impressed
he notices a monitor which displays a complex program entitled j
foster algorithm analysis
he looks proud
the three of them have been up all night fueled by caffeine and excitement
darcy when youre done take the soil samples to professor meyers in geology
remind him he owes me
we might want to perform a spectral analysis
i flew all the way out here might as well make myself useful
this is the offer janes been waiting for
she gets up inserts the piece of equipment shes been working on into a rack mounted server
you know what would be really useful
do you still have that friend at ligo
she was more than a friend
could you call in a favor
you dont think this was just a magnetic storm
th blue revisions a
if im right their observatory must have picked up gravitational waves during last nights event
jane heads over to a computer monitor
meaning these anomalies might signify something bigger
how big are we talking about
jane indicates the footage on the monitor
as the last of the bifrost cloud disappears into the night sky there appears to be a blister in space bulging out in convex and covered with stars
i think the lensing around the edges is characteristic of an einstein rosen bridge
i thought you were a science major
selvig shoots jane a confused look
she was the only applicant
an einstein rosen bridge a theoretical connection between two different points of space time
darcy stares blankly
th blue revisions b
selvig looks skeptical
jane prints out a frame grab off the monitor
th blue revisions
jane indicates the print out showing the constellations seen through the bubble in the clouds
what do you see here
but not our stars
she spreads out a star chart barely able to contain her excitement
this is the star alignment for our quadrant this time of year
so unless ursa minor decided to take the day off
those are someone elses constellations
selvigs intrigued in spite of himself
darcy pulls another frame grab of the bifrost footage from the printer and hangs it on the wall when something in the image catches her eye
hey check it out
jane and selvig examine the photo amazed
i think i left something at the hospital
as jane walks away we reveal the photo
inside the bifrost funnel cloud is a figure the vague but unmistakable shape of a man
at the top of the palace we see a small figure on the balcony
as we move closer we see it is a burdened odin looking out over asgard
frigga enters to find odin standing lost in thought
th blue revisions a
how could you have done this
do you understand what he set in motion
hes taken us to the brink of war
you would lose him forever
hes your son
what would you have done
th blue revisions
i would not have exiled him to a world of mortals stripped of his powers to suffer alone
i would not have had the heart for such cruelty
that is why im king
i too grieve the loss of our son
but there are some things that even i cannot undo
you can bring him back
his fate is in his own hands now
thor awakens on a hospital bed
he notices restraints on his wrists now
he pulls at them tries to free himself to no avail
its not possible
he tries again mustering all his strength
one of his hands slips free from its restraint
jane again faces the admissions nurse with selvig and darcy nearby
im sorry only relatives can visit patients
im his wife
darcy stifles a snicker at this as the nurse looks doubtful
i thought you said you didnt know him
th blue revisions a
i meant i barely know him anymore
the man hes become
i mean what woman really knows her husband anyway
none of us dear
hes in room
jane selvig and darcy head down the corridor passing the destruction of the er thor wrecked the previous night
th blue revisions
they enter thors room
they step inside to find thors bed empty
jane selvig and darcy quickly climb into janes suv
jane starts the car frustrated
i just lost my most important piece of evidence
so now what
we find him
did you see what he did in there
i dont know if finding him is the best idea
i want to know what that thing was and he may have the answers
we dont have a choice
she pulls out her taser and a can of mace
so were just going to spend the rest of the day looking for him
however long it takes
jane puts the car in reverse and backs up when she collides with thor again dressed in stolen hospital scrubs
jane and selvig exchange a look
th blue revisions a
jane and selvig emerge from the suv help thor to his feet
im so sorry
i swear im not doing that on purpose
th blue revisions
thor looks up at the sky
this is earth isnt it
i think you may have hit him with the car one time too many
lets get you some clothes
sif loki and the warriors three battered and shell shocked still reeling from the days events sit before a roaring central fire
hogun reaches into the flames pulls out some fragile healing stones
neither the fire nor the stones burn him
as he carefully places the stones over the wounds of his comrades the stones begin to glow
he crushes them to a powder
his comrades injuries heal up at the glowing powders touch
fandral winces in pain as hogun heals his gaping wound
volstagg looks at the skin on his arm healing but still blackened from the necrotizing touch of the frost giant
loki watches him then stares at his own arm where the giants touch turned his skin blue
its undamaged back to its normal color
we should never have let him go
there was no stopping him
at least hes only banished not dead
which is what wed all be if that guard hadnt told odin where wed gone
how did the guard even know
loki stares at his arm
i told him
th blue revisions a
i told him to go to odin after wed left
though he should be flogged for taking so long
th blue revisions
you told the guard
i saved our lives
i had no idea father would banish him for what he did
loki youre the only one who can help thor now
you must go to the allfather and convince him to change his mind
and if i do then what
i love thor more dearly than any of you but you know what he is
you saw how he was today
is that what asgard needs from its king
the others exchange glances torn
loki has a point
he leaves the room
hogun stares after him
he may speak about the good of asgard but hes always been jealous of thor
true but we should be grateful to him
he did save our lives
laufey said there were traitors in the house of odin
the others turn to the usually quiet hogun
why is it every time you choose to speak it has to be something dark and ominous
a master of magic could easily bring three jotuns into asgard
the others look to hogun understanding the implication
th blue revisions a
lokis always been one for mischief but youre talking about something else entirely
th blue revisions
who else could elude heimdalls gaze with tricks of light and shadow
the ceremony was interrupted just before thor was named king
we should go to the allfather
and tell him what
oh by the way we think your son just betrayed the throne
and do us a favor
bring back thor
theres a good fellow
its our duty
if any of our suspicions are right then all of asgard is in danger
loki heads into the vault sees the casket of ancient winters sitting on its stand
he walks over to it slowly reaches out to it lifts it between his forearms off its pedestal
as he does a blueness spreads from his arms across his body
the latticework behind the casket starts to separate the destroyer rousing
a fire starts to glow within its black metal armor as it rattles to life but loki ignores it the blueness spreading further consuming his whole body
th blue revisions
loki turns sees odin hurrying into the room the destroyer goes motionless the latticework rejoining before it
odin eyes loki with dismay
am i cursed
put the casket down
loki sets the casket back upon its pedestal his body quickly returning to its normal form and color
he stares at his father
what am i
youre my son
what more than that
odin doesnt answer
he looks suddenly weary burdened
loki sizes him up realizes the truth
the casket wasnt the only thing you took from jotunheim that day was it
odin looks him in the eye
he can deny it no longer
in the aftermath of the battle i went into the temple and i found a baby
small for a giants offspring abandoned suffering left to die
loki is sent reeling by the revelation
he desperately struggles to make sense of it all
th blue revisions a
you were knee deep in jotun blood
why would you take me
you were an innocent child
you took me for a purpose what was it
odin doesnt answer
i thought we could unite our kingdoms one day bring about an alliance bring about a permanent peace
but those plans no longer matter
so i am no more than another stolen relic locked up here until you might have use of me
why do you twist my words
you could have told me what i was from the beginning
why didnt you
you are my son
i wanted only to protect you from the truth
because i am the monster parents tell their children about at night
it all makes sense now
why you favored thor all these years
th blue revisions b
because no matter how much you claim to love me you could never have a frost giant sitting on the throne of asgard
odins body begins to shake he lifts his hand
it starts to move out of synch temporarily leaving a trail the effect of the odinsleep approaching
loki doesnt notice as odin tries to fight it off
listen to me
loki strides away towards the exit
odin starts towards him when the enormous mental emotional and physical strain of recent events finally takes its toll
the effect of the odinsleep consumes him
his entire body now moves out of sync with the rest of the world leaving trails behind him as he staggers backwards
odin falls back against a wall his face contorting in a scream
he collapses to the stone floor
loki shocked hurries to him
he takes odin in his arms calls out

cars pick ups and suvs are parked around the crater the sound of a boisterous party coming from within
th blue revisions
it looks like the whole town has turned out
locals sit on lounge chairs drink beer from coolers laugh and talk
they watch the center of the crater where large men have formed a line to take a turn with the mysterious object
one of them struggles and fails to lift it
as he gives up the next man steps up and takes his turn straining from the effort
other townies snap pictures of the scene with their cell phones
they hear an approaching rumble then clear a path as a large pick up truck backs its way down the craters edge
an eager townie hops out the passenger side and pulls a thick chain from the back of the truck
he fastens one end around the object then securely affixes the chain to the bumper and the rear of the undercarriage
thisll do it
he yells to the driver
okay let er rip
the townsfolk watch as the pick ups engine roars then strains its wheels spinning futilely until finally the rear of the truck along with the back wheels and axles break
off and go flying
people dive out of the way
the pick up driver sticks his head out
he is stan the man lee
he looks back shocked
the townsfolk laugh the party continuing
they dont notice as an imposing government vehicle pulls up to a stop
a fed in a suit climbs out peers down at the boisterous gathering below his eyes fixed on the object at the center of the crater
he is shield agent coulson
he stares down at the object which glows with an otherworldly blue energy mjolnir
he pulls out a phone
sir weve found it
th blue revisions a
in a back room thor now shirtless and wearing jeans looks around for a t shirt
jane and darcy standing in the lab cant help but notice his reflection in the mirror
darcy eyes his powerful build rippling biceps
you know for a crazy homeless guy hes pretty cut
jane turns away
thor emerges from the back room holding a t shirt
hey sorry i tased you
thor heads over to janes work area starts fiddling with the equipment there with interest
jane hurries over to put a stop to it
she leads him away from the work station
thor holds up the t shirt
on the front it bear a sticker which reads hello my name is dr
thor looks at it puzzled
jane rips the sticker off
th blue revisions
thor stares at her a beat
theyre the only clothes i had thatll fit you
they will suffice
thor turns his attention to the pictures of the bifrost on the wall
now tell me
thor studies the frame grabs with interest
jane points to his form in the bifrost photo
what were you doing in that
he glances at it dismissive
what does anyone do in the bifrost
everyone stares at him
selvig seems to recognize the word
jane opens her notebook quickly writes the word down
thor moves close to her eyes the notations and drawings within the book curious
amused skeptical the bifrost
jane starts to get uncomfortable with thor standing so close to her looking over her notations
she quickly closes the book
what exactly is the bifrost
this mortal form has grown weak

somebody get the mortal a pop tart
frigga sits at her husbands bedside holding his hand
odin lies there looking pale and lifeless his body and the space around it warped from the effect of the odinsleep
the walls of the chamber have moved close around him protecting him like a dark crypt sealing off any daylight
loki sits at odins side across from frigga
she speaks softly to him
i asked him to be honest with you from the beginning
there should be no secrets in a family
so why did he lie
he kept the truth from you so that you would never feel different
you are in every way our son loki and we your family
you must know that
loki takes this in stares at odin
you can speak to him
he can see and hear us even now
how long will it last
th blue revisions
i dont know
this time is different
we were unprepared
i never get used to seeing him like this
the most powerful being in the nine realms lying helpless until his body is restored
but hes put it off for so long now i fear
loki takes her hand
shes grateful wipes tears from her eyes
youre a good son
loki sits there uncertain how to react uncertain how he really feels
we mustnt lose hope that your father will return to us
and your brother
loki looks to frigga concerned
what hope is there for thor
theres always a purpose to everything your father does
thor may yet find a way home
loki looks troubled by the revelation
he rises heads for the exit when they hear the clatter of armored footsteps hurriedly approaching
enter the room block his way out
loki tenses prepared for the worst but the guards just stand before them
loki is baffled
thor is banished
the line of succession falls to you
until he awakens asgard is yours

we recognize them from the crater
among them is the drunk townie jake who is not presently drunk

isabela pours them a couple cups of coffee
you missed all the excitement out at the crater
jane and selvig overhear this exchange a look turn to the townies with interest
theyre saying some kind of satellite crashed in the desert
we were having a good time with it till the feds showed up chased us out
to the townies excuse me did you say there was a satellite crash
they said it was radioactive
and i had my hands all over it
im probably sterile now
thor unconcerned prepares to dig into the giant pile of pancakes
darcy is amazed by the sight

darcy whips out her cellphone

thor looks puzzled as she snaps a photo of him and his massive stack of food
to the townies what did the satellite look like

but it was heavy
nobody could lift it
this gets thors attention

thor springs to his feet heads over to drunk townie jake and pulls the townie around to face him

thor grins his spirits soaring as he quickly strides out of the diner
i wouldnt bother
looked like the whole army was coming in when we left
thor studies the position of the sun gauging his bearings
jane darcy and selvig catch up to him
where are you going
twelve miles east of here
he starts to stride determinedly down the street
jane walks with him
to get what belongs to me
so now you own a satellite
its not what they say it is
whatever it is the government seems to think its theirs
you intend to just walk in there and take it
he stops walking
th blue revisions

all the answers you seek will be yours once i reclaim mjolnir
darcy looks to the others

he pulls her aside
thor can tell that selvig doesnt much care for him

our people must have a sense of continuity in order to feel safe in these difficult times

theyre by arturos when a pick up truck pulls up before them stopped by traffic
in the back of the vehicle jane notices partially covered by a tarp the dark matter analysis machine from her lab
thats my stuff
jane selvig and darcy reach the lab where government vehicles are parked
shield agents haul equipment out of the lab and load it into waiting vans
other agents strip all the equipment from inside the pinzgauer and cart it away
still others emerge from her trailer arms loaded with scientific instruments and documents
what the hell is going on here
the agents ignore her as agent coulson approaches
foster im agent coulson with selvig recognizing the name of the organization grows wary
th blue revisions a
i dont care who you work for you cant do this
this is more serious than you realize
let it go
let it go
this is my life
were here investigating a security threat
we need to appropriate your equipment and all your atmospheric data
by appropriate you mean steal
instead of answering coulson gives her a check
this should more than compensate you for your trouble
she throws the check to the ground without looking at it
i cant just pick up replacements from radioshack
i made most of that equipment myself
then im sure you can do it again
and im sure i can sue you for violating my constitutional rights

he tries to walk away but jane blocks his path
she is fully herself fueled by outrage
so are we
were on the verge of extraordinary
jane holds up her notebook
everything i know about this phenomenon is in this lab and in this book and no one has the right to take it from me
coulson gestures to a nearby agent who promptly plucks the notebook out of janes hands and adds it to the pile hes carrying
jane is stunned
thank you for your cooperation
he gets into a car
the cars and trucks pull away
jane selvig and darcy enter staring in shock at the now empty space

jane looks down the street and sees something that intrigues her

thor enters the store and approaches a pet store clerk
i need a horse
sorry we dont sell horses
just dogs cats birds
then give me one of those large enough to ride
the pet store clerk looks confused
just then thor hears a car horn
he turns to the open door
across the street jane calls to him from the pinzgauer
th blue revisions
you still want a lift
its story time in the library as a librarian reads a book the secret history of giants to a group of kids
and though theyre large giants can be quiet
you have to listen carefully for the sound of their footsteps because they may be closer than you think
nearby selvig sits at a computer terminal finishing up his e mail
beside him a kid flips through a book with interest
the librarian stops mid story and calls to the kid pleasantly
joshua come sit down
its story time
the kid closes his book and joins the others
selvig looks over notices the title of the book the kid was reading he picks it up flips through it stops at the section on scandinavian mythology
its a picture of a rainbow bridge coming down from asgard to earth
asgardians walk upon it among them odin loki and thor who wields mjolnir
on the ground below them a group of vikings kneel reverently
he eyes the illustration pondering
janes pinzgauer cuts off the road heads over the rugged terrain
storm clouds roll in over the desert sky
jane drives pumped with adrenaline nervous and excited as thor sits beside her upbeat and eager for battle

ive never done anything like this before
have you ever done anything like this before
thor looks amused by her excitement
youre brave to do it
they just stole my entire lifes work
i really dont have anything left to lose
but youre clever
far more clever than anyone else in this realm
why do you talk like that
you think me strange
jane laughs catches herself
just a little
good strange or bad strange
im not quite sure yet
she looks at him sees him staring at her
shes lost in his gaze distracted when the pinzgauer lurches
she quickly turns her eyes forward regains control of the car
she glances back at him
hes confident determined
who are you
youll see soon enough
you promised me answers

what you seek its a bridge

god i hope youre not crazy
as the pinzgauer heads away we continue up a hillside revealing a light illuminating the valley beyond
as we move closer we see the glow comes from now set up around the crater vehicles trailers barricades
armed guards man a gate in the razor wire fence that runs fifty yards from the craters edge enclosing the complex
clear plastic access tubes with junction boxes lead to a translucent cube structure erected in the middle of the crater
through the glass walls of the bases command trailer we see coulson directing technicians busy at work
within the cube structure itself a team of shield scientists work with high tech machinery analyzing the object at the center of it all mjolnir
jane and thor crawl to the edge of the ridge look through binoculars see the impressive shield base
that isnt a satellite crash
they would have hauled the wreckage away not built a city around it
thor shrugs out of his jacket and hands it to her
youre going to need this
thunder rumbles overhead
she stares at him intently and takes his jacket
once i have mjolnir i will return what they stole from you
th blue revisions a
he looks to her already knowing that jane may disobey his request
look whats down there
you cant just walk in grab our stuff and walk out
jane looks relieved
im going to fly out
before she can react he starts heading towards the crater
the first drops of rain begin to patter into the dust
th blue revisions
but thor is already headed towards the crater
a needle spikes on a handheld sensor device
the technician holding it looks over at the hammer
mjolnir begins to give off a subtle glow
a bolt of lightning cracks across the sky above
its fuzzy doesnt show much
we widen to see we are a younger shield agent a techie in a headset monitors security
agent sitwell humorless just this side of junior looks on none too pleased
feed from the keyhole
can barely penetrate the cloud cover
the techie hikes a thumb at another monitor squelching with static
it shows an sar shot of the area laid over a terrain map
techs barely working as it is with all the interference that things giving off
he gestures towards the hammer
he checks a computer
hey weve got a commercial aircraft coming in right over us southwest airlines flight
reroute it like all the others
can i get the passengers some free drinks for the trouble
sitwell glares at him

itd be a nice gesture
the techie types into the computer when he notices something on another screen holds up a hand
hold a sec
we got something outside the fence west side
he points at the screen
through the haze it shows a thermal image huddled beside the fence
into a radio delancey jackson check it out
a pair of shield agents delancey and jackson take off in a jeep to investigate
sitwell looks out the window something strange catching his attention
we see in the windows reflection that a glow is coming from the hammer containment area
the jeep pulls up as the agents scan the fence with a flashlight see nothing unusual
looks like were good here
must have been another coyote
just then the agents notice a section of the fence has been bent up from the ground leaving a gap
th blue revisions
before they can call it in a massive crack of lightning illuminates the night sky revealing the silhouette of a large man standing outside the drivers jacksons side of the
delancey looks over notices
the agents reach for their weapons
thor elbows the driver across the jaw causing him to drop his weapon
jackson slumps over the steering wheel as delancey starts to raise a shotgun at thor
thor grabs the barrel yanks it out of delanceys hands and thrusts the hilt back smashing the agents jaw
thor reaches into the jeep to grab a rain slicker
sitwell talks into his radio starting to look worried
delancey jackson report
thor now wearing a shield rain slicker makes his way across the base
another shield agent approaches the jeep spots the unconscious delancey and jackson
he quickly calls into his radio
weve got a perimeter breach
the security monitors squelch with static and interference
sitwell holds his pda even its on the fritz
sitwell and the techie watch the monitors warily
on the monitor showing the hammer containment area mjolnir starts to crackle with energy
to the techie get coulson
sitwell punches an alarm

as thor makes his way towards the crater an alarm sounds and security lights explode to life
a spotlight fires out from the base and sweeps across the ridge towards jane
she ducks down out of sight
she pulls out her cellphone and dials
we hear selvigs recorded message
youve reached dr
please leave me a message
his voicemail beeps
she talks quietly urgently
erik okay first of all dont worry
im perfectly fine really
more sounds of mayhem come from the base
but if you dont hear from me again you might want to come out to the crater site and look for me
i kind of did what you said i shouldnt do
she hangs up
coulson emerges from the shield command trailer and marches across the mud radio to his ear
he looks out across the lit up site uneasily
th blue revisions
a shield guard moves through the base rifle in hand
from the shadows behind a trailer a figure looks out at him
as the guard raises his radio to check in thor quickly rushes towards him and chokes him out
he falls to the ground
thor notices the ar rifle lying on the ground beside the fallen guard
he stares down at the weapon quizzically
as more guards approach thor snatches up the weapon and takes cover in the shadows of the trailer
the guards pass by
thor peers around the corner sees the well guarded main entrance tube to the center of the site
a bright light suddenly illuminates his face
he looks to see an atv moving across the site shining its spotlight right on him
thor sees that the atv driver has spotted him
the driver raises his radio to report
thor knows he has to act fact
he raises the rifle then flips it over in the air and catches it by the barrel
he rears the weapon back then hurls it like a hammer
it flies through the air smashing the atvs spotlight
glass and debris shower the driver who takes his hands off the wheel to protect himself
the atv roars out of control past the guards near the tube entrance
the guards notice and chase after it
thor emerges from the shadows watches the guards abandoning the site entrance
the atv driver looks forward in panic as the atv approaches the crater lip
the vehicle careens over the edge of the crater and heads straight for one of the plastic tunnels
the technicians inside scatter as the atv crashes into it tearing into the tunnel sending sparks everywhere
the atv finally comes to a stop the tunnel collapsing around it and the driver
shield agents rush in behind to help

jane peers over the ridge stares down at the frenzied aftermath of the atv crash at the base on high alert
lightning cracks in the sky behind her
coulson climbs to the lip of the crater as a light rain begins to fall
he eyes the damage of the atv crash
hes not pleased
the light rain becomes a downpour
as shield agents pull the atv driver from the wreckage thor races towards the unguarded entrance to the tunnels and heads inside
thor races up the entrance ramp
before him two guards round the corner
thor knocks out the first guard then tackles the second
he hurries around the corner when more guards come up a ladder ahead
thor punches the closest guard sending him tumbling backwards toppling the others on the ladder behind him
thor takes off running as the guards regroup and give chase
thor spots the glow of mjolnir in the central cube through the translucent walls of the tunnels
he hurries through to tunnels to find a way towards it

he leaps in and the bucket lifts into the air
through the translucent plastic we see thor racing through the tubing
as thor races through the tunnel a guard runs right at him on a collision course
thor takes him out with a punch to the gut then turns to see more agents coming towards him
thor picks up the fallen guard he punched then throws him into the approaching agents scattering them
thor turns around runs back the way he came
the agents give chase

its a clear field of vision nowhere to hide
a digital read out gives information on the distance to the target
he locks in on thor whos inside the plastic tubing emerging from the junction box and heading towards the cube structure
thor races through the tunnel comes across a wall of agents
thor roars and barrels through them elbowing punching whatever it takes to keep moving
as he takes down the last agent thor sees the last junction box and the entrance to the cube structure up ahead
he races towards it
he can actually see mjolnir within the middle of the structure when bam
from out of nowhere a fist lands a powerful blow across his jaw sending him reeling
dazed thor looks up to see the biggest of them all standing between him and his hammer in the cube structure beyond
thor sizes him up
thor and the huge agent explode through the wall of the junction box then crash into the mud sending them sliding
th blue revisions a
barton has thor in his sites
the sniper stands still as a statue
coulson hurries through the tunnel ready to give the word to barton when he stops short
he sees what looks like an electrical storm erupting inside the structure ahead directly above the crater
and the hammer
jane sees shield agents and guards swarming into the cube containment structure
thor and the huge agent struggle to stand in the mud
through the translucent walls of the cube structure thor sees mjolnir
the huge agent rises up before him blocking his view
rain and blood run down thors face
he lunges forward whipping his feet in front of him then kicks out nailing the huge agent in the chest
the agent goes down hard as thors momentum carries him past
thor stands heads for the cube structure when the huge guard grabs his ankle in a last effort
thor looks back down at his foe then drops backwards pile driving his elbow into the fallen agents chest
the huge agent grimaces in pain defeated
thor races back towards the structure
from outside thor rips an opening in the plastic wall of the structure
he stands there soaking bleeding caked with wet earth
his hammer rests just a few yards before him energy surging around it

as thor approaches his hammer mjolnir starts to glow brighter blue electricity sparking off its surface
the crackling energy seems to reach out to him
coulson notices his interest piqued
above the open ceiling of the structure bartons crane bucket comes into view
wind and rain whip around barton as he stares into his rifle site locked on the back of thors head his finger on the trigger
thor stands next to the hammer feels its power
he reaches out to it confidently

armed agents approach behind him
he motions for them to hold their positions then radios barton

coulson watches thor with anticipation as thor wraps his hand around the hammer
he smiles triumphant lifts
but the hammer doesnt move
thor looks confused tries again with two hands to no avail anger and frustration overtaking him
he strains with all his might screams from the effort bellowing up at the storm and lightning above him
something begins to appear on the side of mjolnir glowing runes
thor looks down sees them
but still the hammer doesnt budge
thor falls to his knees before it rain pouring down around him as the glowing runes fade away
coulson looks on disappointed
shield agents move in guns trained on thor surrounding him
coulson activates his radio
ground units move in
as the agents surround him thor doesnt seem to notice or care
he just sits there on his knees head bowed in the rain a man broken lost
from overhead we see the hammer in the cube containment room
we pull up as the guards approach thor then continue to climb until we see the whole camp and the extensive damage thors done to it during the melee
jane lowers her binoculars sensing things have gone from bad to worse
she steels herself then starts over the ridge to help him
almost immediately a spotlight sweeps past her
she hears the sound of dogs and shield agents approaching sees the glow of flashlights moving from the base towards her
with no other choice she makes a quick retreat

thor sits in a chair staring forward blankly hands cuffed behind him
coulson stands across from him
its not easy to do what you did
you made us all look like a bunch of mall cops
the men you so easily subdued are highly trained professionals and in my experience it takes someone whos received similar training to do what you did to them
would you like to tell me where you received your training
thor sits silently
then again you strike me more as the soldier of fortune type
what was it south africa
still no answer

let me explain to father is dead

your banishment the threat of a new war it was too much for him to bear

you mustnt blame yourself

the burden of the throne has fallen to me now
can i come home
the truce with jotunheim is conditional upon your exile
but couldnt we find a way to mother has forbidden your return
thor nods lowers his head beaten
this is goodbye brother
im so sorry
no im sorry
thank you for coming here
nothing could have stopped me
coulson enters the room but seems to take no notice of loki
fare well brother
i just got back
thor looks up to see that loki is gone
where did we leave off

agents and scientists work to repair the damaged area around mjolnir
they take no notice of loki as he steps up beside the hammer
he stares at it intrigued wondering
can he do it
he reaches down tries to lift it but cant

he was distraught when he found out that youd taken all of our research
it was years of his life gone
he got depressed started drinking and
well you know the rest
you mind if we take a moment to verify his identity
the techie at a computer nearby runs the name
you can understand how a man could go off like that
i mean a big faceless organization like yours coming in with their jack booted thugs and stealing private property
is how he described it
that doesnt explain how he managed to tear through our security
hes a bit of a fitness nut

after a beat he turns back to selvig
it says here hes an m

he switched careers and became a physicist
hes quite brilliant really
if you would just release him to me i promise to keep an eye on him
coulson thinks sizing selvig up then smiles
he turns to an agent nearby
blake to dr
the techie looks to him surprised
make sure he stays in town for the next few days in case we need to talk to him again
selvig shakes his hand
selvig bursts into the room with a shield agent to find a seated thor
donny donny donny
there you are
thor looks up unsure what the hell is going on
selvig pulls thor to his feet gives him a warm hug
its going to be all right my friend
come on im taking you home

he leads the bewildered thor out the door
as thor and selvig make their way past the shield security room thor notices janes possessions and equipment from the smith motors lab stacked under a tarp
he spots janes hand written journal among them
as he passes he quickly takes it from the pile and pockets it
coulson looks at the computer bearing donald blakes dmv record
a security warning over the image clearly reads security alert falsified data
he knows its been a ruse all along
he looks to selvig and thor heading away from the security room then follows them outside
coulson and two shield agents watch as selvig walks with thor away from the base to the suv
coulson calls to selvig
just keep him away from the bars

i now rule asgard until odin awakens
perhaps you should not have so carelessly abandoned me
this gives laufey pause
or perhaps it was the wisest choice ive ever made
i will hear you
th blue revisions
i will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers lead you into his chambers and let you slay him where he lies
ill keep the throne and you will have the casket
laufey studies lokis face
why would you do this
when all is done we will have a permanent peace between our two worlds
then i the bastard son will have accomplished what odin and thor never could
this is a great day for jotunheim
asgard is finally ours
asgard is mine
the rest of the nine realms will be yours if you do as youre told
laufey considers the proposition
loki turns to leave
as he goes the slightest trace of a smile crosses his face
loki emerges out of the bifrost as heimdall steps away from his controls
heimdall glares at loki
what troubles you gatekeeper
th blue revisions
i turned my gaze upon you in jotunheim but could neither see nor hear you
you were shrouded from me like the frost giants who entered this realm
perhaps your senses have weakened after your many years of service
or perhaps someone has found a way to hide that which he does not wish me to see
loki sizes him up smiles
you have great power heimdall
tell me did odin ever fear you
and why is that
because he is my king and i am sworn to obey him
just as youre sworn to obey me now
then you will open the bifrost to no one until i have undone what my brother has started
loki heads out of the observatory
heimdall stares after him

thor and selvig sit at a booth at the back of the local dive
the bartender sets down a couple mugs of beer and two shots of whiskey
selvig pours the shot into his mug and downs it
thor follows his example
th blue revisions
seems darcys a terrible intern but a talented hacker
thank you for what youve done
dont thank me
i only did it for jane
are you in love with her
of course not
janes like a daughter to me
her father and i taught at university together
a good man but he never listened
this registers with thor
neither did i
selvig eyes him with interest
i dont know if youre really delusional and i really dont care at this point
i just care about her
ive seen the way she looks at you
i swear to you i mean her no harm
if thats the case then ill buy you one more drink and youll leave town tonight
a long pause then thor nods
he takes a drink
th blue revisions
i had it all backwards
i had it all wrong
selvig watches him keenly
this is a different thor than hes seen before
its not a bad thing finding out that you dont have all the answers
thats when you start asking the right questions
thor takes this in
for the first time in my life i have no idea what im supposed to do
anyone whos ever going to find their way in this world has to start by admitting they dont know where the hell they are
hey i know you man
an intimidating drunk townie nearby sizes up thor
he is one of the townies from isabelas diner who saw thor earlier
he approaches belligerent and looking for a fight
you were in the diner with that hot girl
thor doesnt like where this is going
i wouldnt mind her doing a little research on me
thor is annoyed
i have no quarrel with you
but shes a lady
you should be more respectful
th blue revisions a
and you should shut the hell up princess
selvig looks to thor concerned that hes going to lose it
but to his surprise thor remains unaffected by the townies baiting
i will not fight him
then itll be easy to kick your ass
selvig stands steps between the two men
lets keep our heads
just then selvig head butts the townie knocking him out
selvig downs his drink then hurls his glass aside shattering it on the ground
th blue revisions
thor and selvig stumble down the street singing a norwegian folk song
they improvise an impromptu drinking song dance routine involving side steps and happy slaps optimistically in time with the song
the mood is good our hearts are full theres magic in the air
its all because were here tonight and havent got a care
so raise a glass and toast to life wherever it may lead tra la la tra la la a friend is fine indeed
tra la la tra la la a friend is fine indeed
thor holds up a hand for selvigs last finishing slap
selvig misses it completely and falls out of frame like a straight dead weight with a clunk
emerging from behind the car where selvig fell thor stands up selvig slung over his shoulder and starts to walk up the street towards janes trailer
the small trailer is in a state of perpetual disarray strewn with various books old pizza boxes etc
a worried jane lies on her bed trying to read
shes startled by the loud rapping on the door
she bolts to the door and opens it to find standing there with the unconscious selvig slung over his shoulder
is he all right
not injured at all
th blue revisions a
as thor enters he bangs selvigs head on the doorway
sorry my friend
he made his ancestors proud
th blue revisions
put him on the bed
thor moves through the small trailer carrying selvig like a bear lugging another bear smashing into things along the way until he finally sets selvig down on janes bed
selvig awakens groggily and looks up at him through bleary eyes
i still dont believe youre the god of thunder
but you ought to be
thor grins pats him on the cheek
as selvig drifts off to sleep thor pulls a blanket over him
jane watches stunned by their friendship impressed by thors tenderness
thor turns back to her looks around
these are your chambers
jane suddenly becomes self conscious
she starts cleaning up the mess around her
well its more of a temporary living space really
i dont usually have visitors in here
thor picks up a sock off the floor
she snatches it from him puts it away
can we go outside
thor steps off a ladder onto the roof of smith motors
he offers jane his hand helps her up
theres a telescope set up a couple chairs some blankets
i come up here sometimes when i cant sleep
or when im trying to reconcile particle data
or when darcys driving me crazy
i come up here a lot now that i think about it
thor looks at the night sky filled with stars
th blue revisions a
im glad youre safe
youve been very kind
ive been far less grateful than you deserve
i also hit you with my car a couple times so it kind of evens out
he grins then reaches into his pocket and pulls out her i dont believe it
she takes it from him surprised and grateful
it was all i could get back
not as much as i promised
no this is good
this means i dont have to start from scratch
she sits down and opens the notebook eagerly then stops a harsh realization clouding her face
shield whatever they are
theyre never going to let this research see the light of day
you must do this
you must finish what youve started
because youre right
its taken so many generations for your people to get to this point
youre nearly there
you just need someone to show you how close you really are
th blue revisions
thor moves beside her opens her notebook turns to the page which bears a sketch of the bifrost
he takes the pen from the notebook begins to add to the sketch leading from one point to another in space
look your ancestors called it magic
you call it science
i come from a place where theyre one and the same thing
we recognize that thor is drawing the branches of yggdrasil as she looks on amazed and intrigued
what is it
this is how my father explained it to me
your world is one of the nine realms of the cosmos linked to each other by the branches of yggdrasil the worlds tree
now you see it every day without realizing
images glimpsed through what did you call it
checks her notebook this hubble telescope
so nine realms
they look at each other
this is going to be a long night
jane sleeps beside thor on the blankets on the rooftop
he stares up at the night sky
she rolls close to him nuzzles against him in her sleep
he looks down at her beautiful in the moonlight looks out at the town beyond her
volstagg eats ravenously from a platter of food
sif stands nearby ill at ease
fandral watches volstagg incredulously as the large warrior stuffs himself
finally fandral can stand it no more
th blue revisions
our dearest friend banished loki on the throne asgard on the brink of war yet you manage to consume four wild boar six pheasant a side of beef and two
casks of ale
shame on you

fandral moves to throw the platter in the fire but volstagg pulls his weapon stopping him
do not mistake my appetite for apathy
stop it both of you
we all know what we have to do were just too damned afraid to do it
we must go
we must find thor
hogun starts to pull the delicate healing stones from the fire carefully putting them into a pouch at his side
its treason hogun
to hell with treason its suicide
heimdall may be watching
its said he can hear yes yes we know
thor would do the same for us
an einherjar guard enters
heimdall demands your presence
volstagg quickly drains his flagon of ale

a groggy hungover selvig emerges from janes trailer
he sees thor with jane
selvig eyes the two of them together then i need some coffee
the three head inside smith motors
shield agents garrett and cale watch the scene pointing a small audio surveillance device towards the lab
darcy and selvig sit at a card table drinking coffee
thor holds a couple plates as jane makes eggs on a hotplate
she scoops them out onto the plates
thor takes them over to the table sets them down before selvig and darcy
youre very welcome
jane joins them at the card table with a couple more plates
she and thor sit with the others and start to eat their breakfast looking like a little family
th blue revisions
on a roof across the street from smith motors agents garrett and cale continue their surveillance bored out of their wits
agent cale watches the group through the lab window with binoculars
agent garrett listens to his comm link turns to cale
they want an update
tell them hes eating eggs
scrambled or fried
cale glares at him
target is eating eggs sir
well keep you posted
as the group finishes breakfast thor looks at the mug in his hand gets an idea
may i have this
excuse me a moment
in front of her diner isabela prepares to open for the day
through the window of isabelas we see chairs still atop tables
isabela sweeps the front porch
she looks up to see thor approaching
she eyes him suspiciously
he offers her a mug
to replace the one i broke
please forgive my behavior
th blue revisions a
she takes it looks at it curiously then smiles at him
if i may id like to come back for more of your coffee
he nods and walks away
she stares after him smiling and shrugs
she could do worse
sif and the warriors three enter warily to find the intimidating heimdall standing before the observatorys controls
he glares at them accusingly
good heimdall less us explain you would defy the commands of loki our king break every oath you have taken as warriors and commit treason to bring thor back
the four exchange nervous glances
yes but good
the group looks puzzled
what did he just say
so youll help us
i am bound by honor to our king
i cannot open the bifrost to you
with that heimdall leaves them alone in the observatory
the others exchange puzzled looks

fifteen miles due northwest
lets go take a look
amidst the fury of the bifrost storm the warriors three and sif drop to the ground in the new mexico desert
they clamber to their feet as the bifrost quickly recedes the hole in the sky closing up behind it
the bifrost runes cover the desert sand around them
he must have landed nearby
its time to put our tracking skills to work
check the sand for indentations of his boot prints
the winds would have blown them away by now
we should look for signs of a campfire
or we could just start there
she points behind them to the town of puente antiguo in the distance the only visible sign of civilization and to hogun who has already started walking towards it
volstagg and fandral trade looks their egos bruised
its worth a look i suppose
the party tromps towards the town
townsfolk stare in wonder at the warriors three and sif as they stroll down the street in all their asgardian splendor
a boy hits a baseball which rolls under a parked car
he runs to retrieve it but cant reach it
suddenly the side of the car rises into the air
the boy looks over his mouth dropping open at what he sees
volstagg easily holds the car up with one hand
th blue revisions
volstagg picks up the boys ball then drops the car
he hands the ball back to the boy tousling his hair

it has been a thousand years
things change so fast here
you leave for a millennium and its like the whole neighborhoods gone

perhaps we should split up

intrigued he pulls out a cheeseburger and takes a bite
he likes what he tastes
loki stands with gungnir surveying his kingdom when an einherjar guard quickly approaches him out of breath
my liege the warriors three and the lady sif have gone missing
he knows whos responsible
loki approaches heimdall on the rainbow bridge
tell me loki how did you get the jotuns into asgard
you think the bifrost is the only way in and out of the realm
there are secret paths between worlds to which even you with all your gifts are blind
but i have need of them no longer now that i am king
and i say for your act of treason you are relieved of your duties as gatekeeper
and you are no longer a citizen of asgard
th blue revisions
then i need no longer obey you
heimdall raises his massive sword strides towards loki
loki reaches out and with both hands takes hold of something invisible hovering in mid air before him
as it quickly fades into view we realize what it is the blueness creeps from his hands and up his arms as loki opens the casket towards heimdall who is
from inside the casket all hell breaks loose
the fury of the casket is unleashed its winds not just howling but screaming as ice and snow and darkness come flying straight towards heimdall
ice clings to his body freezing him but still he moves forward
loki starts to get worried
heimdall is nearly upon him
the gatekeeper swings his massive sword at the prince
but the blade stops frozen just inches from lokis throat
loki breathes a sigh of relief and steps past him
loki inserts gungnir into the observatorys control panel and opens the bifrost
he gestures and the veiled destroyer appears before him a fiery glow rising within it
it turns its head toward its king

volstagg takes off running at full speed
as he catches up to his comrades hogun and fandral grab him on either side and with all their asgardian might hurl the voluminous warrior into the air at the
black metal behemoth

the destroyer is unable to react quickly enough as volstagg smashes into the creature
it looks like it might actually work for a moment but the destroyer stays on its feet
it lifts volstagg into the by the scruff of his neck
he shrugs apologetically
the destroyer savagely hurls him at hogun and fandral smashing into them when leaps off a nearby rooftop with her two headed spear and plunges it deep into the back
of the creature
the creature stands there motionless the fire dimming in its faceplate sif standing atop its back
the asgardians have a brief moment of hope
but the creature stirs with life its fire igniting once again
sif looks on with growing trepidation
slowly unnaturally the destroyer spins its torso around degrees to face its attackers
the destroyer unleashes a blast at sif
she barely dives off of the behemoth in time dodging the blast
the destroyer rises again to its full height pulling free from sifs staff the weapon slipping through the slats of its armor
sif and the warriors three try to regroup when the destroyer unleashes another blast sending sif and her comrades flying in all directions

he makes a break for it dodging through the flaming wreckage then grabs the pouch and races back
he opens the pouch to find the fragile stones crushed and useless
he pours the contents out in his hand
give me one
amidst the useless powder he finally finds one stone still intact
thor tosses the pouch aside holds the stone over the end of the iron rod
what are you doing
what is that
as the stone begins to glow thor crushes it
jane looks on amazed as the glowing powder falls upon the piece of iron dissolving it heading downwards until it reaches selvigs wound
the powder heals his wound completely
thor looks down the street sees his wounded friends still lying there as selvig sits up in utter astonishment
he reaches through the hole in his shirt to touch his healed flesh
to jane re thor im really starting to like him
jane turns to thor to find hes gone

the fiery energy within the creature builds up and explodes within him firing out of all his openings
thor smashes the destroyer to the ground in a tremendous heap the fiery energy within it extinguished forever
thor pulls mjolnir from its faceplate walks away from its lifeless carcass
as he does the other objects and debris pulled into the air by the gale winds drop down from the skies around the destroyer burying it

he swings gungnir at thor again
thor catches it in his hand rears back his hammer as if ready to return the blow but instead takes to the air and flies past loki back towards the
loki spins around aims gungnir and fires a blast which immobilizes thor in the air
he hangs there suspended
is the throne really worth what youve done
what you would become
i never wanted the throne
i only wanted to be your equal
now fight me
th blue revisions
with a gesture of gungnir he flings thor to the ground
thor rises to his feet turns to loki
i will not fight you brother
i am not your brother
i never was
loki this is madness
he fires gungnir at thor
thor dodges the blast rolls to his feet
what happened to you on earth that turned you so soft
dont tell me it was a woman
thor doesnt answer
loki laughs realizing hes right
perhaps when were finished here ill pay her a little visit myself
that did it
loki and thor rush at each other
they and their weapons collide
the two battle loki unleashing years of pent up rage and jealousy thor having no choice but to defend himself
the growing bifrost tears through the ice of the planet like a destructive wave breaking it apart
jotuns go running in terror others fall through the breaking ice
jane selvig darcy and coulson look up with concern at the hole in the sky where excess bifrost energy builds up around it
th blue revisions a
th blue revisions
thor and loki battle savagely
loki fires gungnir sending thor sliding across the floor and knocking mjolnir from his hand
the hammer flies into the bifrost towards jotunheim
thor raises his hand towards his hammer tries to summon it back to him to keep it in this realm but the bifrost is too powerful
mjolnir disappears into the maelstrom as thor himself slides towards the bifrost
if you care so much for the jotuns then die with them
the bifrost stretches every cell of thors body trying to drag him away
hes nearly swallowed by the vortex when he concentrates mustering his will
he reaches out his hand towards the bifrost
mjolnir flies back through the maelstrom into thors hand
the hammer pulls him free
loki tries to fire off another blast at him but thor takes to the air speeds towards his brother
thor and loki come crashing through the observatory dome and land hard rolling across the rainbow bridge
as thor gets to his feet he sees loki dangling off the bridges edge
thor steps over to the side of the bridge sees loki looking up at him desperately
lokis fingers start to slip
thor reaches down to grab his brothers wrist but his hand passes through lokis
just then the real loki materializes behind him
thor whirls around as loki stabs him in the chest with gungnir
loki lifts thor into the air impaled on the spear and hurls him across the bridge
th blue revisions
thor bleeding rises to his knees
loki strides up behind him to finish him off when thor swing his hammer around
it passes through him
instantly another loki appears next to him thor swings his hammer but that too is an illusion
loki after loki appears thor futilely swinging at each one never making contact
thor falls back to his knees
the lokis grin as their raises their spears encircling him
i was always more clever than you
yet still not clever enough
with that thor raises his hammer rising into the air summoning lightning
a massive bolt strikes mjolnir then channels outwards splitting up striking each one of the lokis
all of them dissipate into nothingness save one the real loki whos sent flying back across the bridge gungnir knocked from his grasp
thor steps over to his fallen brother lying dazed on his back
loki winces prepares for the worst when thor steps away
loki opens his eyes tries to stand but cant
he looks confused then sees what the problem is mjolnir rests atop his chest
struggle as he may loki cant lift it off
hes pinned to the ground
thor looks about him desperately at the bifrost firing towards jotunheim gaining in strength at the surge of energy moving through the bridge
hes at a loss of what to do
loki watches him smugly
look at you the mighty thor
with all your strength what good does it do you now
thor knows lokis right
hes powerless to stop whats happening
he looks down at the bridge beneath his feet vibrating from the force and speed of the bifrost energy feeding into the observatory
then he gets an idea
he realizes what he must do and what he must sacrifice
thor extends his hand towards loki summoning mjolnir
the hammer goes flying to his grasp
loki looks confused
th blue revisions
thor raises mjolnir in the air
clouds form above him thunder rumbling
lightning arcs off of his hammer as he channels the power of the storm into it then he strikes mjolnir down upon the rainbow bridge
the blow is massive causing a rumbling along the whole bridge shaking the observatory itself like an earthquake
a crack appears where the blow struck
loki rises to his feet
what are you doing
thor lifts the hammer again brings it down harder
the crack grows bigger
the bifrost energy starts to stream out from it
loki thinks fast
if you destroy the bridge youll never see her again
loki grabs gungnir runs towards him ready to pierce thor through the back
summoning every bit of strength he has left thor raises mjolnir one last time drawing lightning to it from all sides and brings it down with a final terrible blow
the bifrost shatters rainbow energy exploding out of it
both loki and thor are hurled into the air by the force of the blast
a wave of destruction moves forward along the bridge towards the observatory breaking it apart as it goes
the observatory rips itself apart
as loki and thor fall together thor grabs hold of one end of gungnir while loki still clutches the other
they both fall towards the massive wave of bifrost energy which spews out from the broken bridge
theyre an instant from being blasted by the destructive force of the energy carried away by the current pulverized by the debris when catches thors leg
thor dangles there holding onto gungnir as loki hangs onto the other end
loki looks up shocked to th blue revisions
standing on the edge of the broken bridge awakened from the odinsleep restored to his full strength
loki searches his fathers face looking for some kind of approval some kind of redemption but all he sees is disappointment and regret
loki lets go
but its too late
odin and thor can only watch as loki falls into the rushing torrent of bifrost energy
it carries him away along with the debris of the bridge and the observatory disappearing out of sight
odin pulls thor up onto the bridge
drained thor falls back into his fathers arms
it is over
the bifrost energy explodes in the sky like fireworks firing in all directions
jane selvig darcy and coulson stand watching in amazement
jane looks back up at the sky distraught
she knows the significance of whats just happened
a feast is in progress as thor sif and the warriors three sit amongst the gathered asgardians
hogun sits between fandral and volstagg who is in the middle of recounting their battle with the destroyer
and then with a mighty bellow i flew at the great metal beast and laid it low
th blue revisions
is that another way of saying you fell on your huge a as a matter of fact falling down was a tactic
lulling the destroyer into a false sense of security
well i was the one who had to drag your enormous carcass off the battlefield
that makes me the real hero
doesnt it hogun
hogun points to volstagg
points to fandral big mouth
the other gathered asgardians laugh
volstagg and fandral look to hogun
the grim warrior gives just a trace of a smile
well how about that
id say that calls for another drink
they laugh and raise another round
frigga sits nearby lost in thought her face betraying the sadness she struggles to conceal
sif notices approaches frigga bows her head
i am so sorry for your loss
frigga takes sifs hand appreciatively
thank you sif
she looks to thor whos unable to enjoy the merriment around him
how is he
th blue revisions a
he mourns for his brother
and he misses her
frigga sees the trace of regret in sifs face as she looks at thor with new feelings
he rises and leaves the hall
he will need his friends now more than ever
i will always be at his side
frigga understands puts her arm around sif gratefully
thor stands alone on the balcony lost in thought
odin walks up behind him
youll be a wise king
there will never be a wiser king than you
or a better father
i have much to learn
i know that now
but some day perhaps i will make you proud
youve already made me proud
odin leaves thor consoled by his words
out of the broken jagged rainbow bridge flows the bifrost energy drifting off into space
thor walks out to its edge where heimdall stands watch
thor stares out at the stellar void
th blue revisions
can you see her
heimdall turns gazes out towards earth
how is she
through the window into janes lab we see an enlarged illustration from her notebook pinned to a board
as we pull away we see a computer terminal displaying a program clearly inspired by the illustration
we pull further back to see that the lab has been transformed into a well funded research facility abuzz with activity
shield scientists and agents work with impressive state of the art equipment
selvig orchestrates the process giving instructions to the scientists
we continue to track right outside the glass windows and rise up to find jane sitting at the front of the roof working at a small improvised workstation notebook at
hand as always
she sets up an impressive high tech device before her which bears the stark industries logo
from behind darcy approaches hands her a flash drive
here you go
jane inserts the flash drive into the device
he would have come back if he could
but if he cant get here on his own
jane hits a switch on the device
suddenly a d holographic projection bursts to life over the device bathing the two women in its glow
we recognize what it is yggdrasil in all its beauty
maybe we can help him find his way back
