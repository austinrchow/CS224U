written by douglas adams based on the book the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy by douglas adams revisions by karey kirkpatrick rd revised draft
hhgg rd revised draft we hear what we will come to know as the voice of the it is an important and popular fact that things are not always what
a small square image appears on screen
the dolphin stadium at sea world
for instance on the planet earth man had always assumed that he was the most intelligent species occupying the planet instead of the third most intelligent which was in fact
the dolphins perform leaping through hoops etc
the second most intelligent creatures were of course dolphins who curiously enough had long known of the impending destruction of the planet earth
they had made many attempts to alert mankind to the danger but most of their communications were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to punch footballs or whistle for tidbits so they
eventually decided they would leave earth by their own means
they leap madly desperately
higher and higher
the last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt to do a double backward somersault through a hoop while whistling the star spangled banner but in fact
the message was this
so long and thanks for all the fish
titles roll full screen mm images dolphins leap over and interact with the opening titles
breathtaking somersaults back flips choreographed to a buzby berkley style song called so long and thanks for all the fish
we end with a wide shot of all the dolphins jumping out of the top of frame but they never come back down
tilt up to a starry night sky the dolphins have vanished
as night turns to morning we hear click then
as well as sea world orlando and san diego reporting their dolphins have mysteriously disappeared overnight
hhgg rd revised draft close on the clock radio from which the voice emanates
a hand shuts it off
arthur dent is awake
his feet land perfectly in slippers as he stands and shuffles out of his very neat but very boring room
in the bathroom arthur gargles in front of the mirror
he bends over to spit revealing a yellow bulldozer through the window crawling toward his house
a tea arthur sets the newspaper with the headline dolphins vanish on the table removes the kettle
doesnt notice through the window more large yellow bulldozers
he pours a cup of tea sets the pot down next o his mobile phone
he picks it up stares at a digital photo on the screen of himself and a very pretty woman tricia at a costume party
he presses the phone to his head as if it were a cold compress
suddenly theres a loud rumbling o
the tea cup rattles
arthur looks out the window
now he sees the bulldozers
the tea cup shatters on the floor
arthur dressed in pajamas and robe lies in the dirt in front of a bulldozer blocking it from destroying his house
he yells into his mobile phone
into phone what do you mean hes gone out to lunch
you just said he was still at breakfast
prosser a bureaucrat leans over him
come off it mr
you cant lie in front of the bulldozers forever
well see who rusts first
this bypass has got to be built and its going to be built
you should have made your protest months ago
the first i heard of it was when a workman came yesterday
i asked if hed come to clean the windows and he said hed come to demolish the house
he didnt tell me right away of course
first he wiped a couple of windows and charged me twenty quid
then he told me
hhgg rd revised draft the bulldozer driver looking guilty ducks behind the steering wheel
prosser removes plans from his briefcase
these plans have been on display at the planning office now for a year
i had to go down to a cellar
thats the display department
i eventually found them in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying beware of the leopard
dent have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if i just let it roll straight over you
none at all
american accent arthur
arthur and prosser turn to see a man cresting a hill pushing a shopping cart which is filled with beer and bags of peanuts
this is ford prefect
as he heads downhill he leaps up and rides the cart down towards arthurs house like a kid in a supermarket
he rolls right past arthur and the bulldozers
he leaps off drags the cart to a full stop
there you are
here drink and eat with me
we need to talk
nows not the best time ford theyre going to demolish my home whoa
you already know
arthur simply motions to the bulldozer
hhgg rd revised draft oh
when you say they you mean they
listen i gotta tell you something important and i gotta tell you now
but what about my house
ford looks to prosser who is conferring with the bulldozer driver
he pushes the cart over to him
arthur watches as ford gestures to prosser who waves his hand and the all the dozer engines die
the bulldozer drivers step down start drinking the beer and eating the peanuts
ford returns to arthur
lets go to the pub
he said they wont destroy your house until theyve finished the beers
can we trust him
id trust him to the end of the earth
and how fars that
about twelve minutes away
ford and arthur enter the half full pub
ford hurries to the bar
arthur follows cell phone to his ear
six pints of bitter
the worlds about to end
oh yes sir
nice weather for it
he starts to pull pints
ford shoves bar peanuts into his pockets while arthur shouts into his phone
well when does he get back from lunch
or is he going straight out for tea
he shuts the phone sits looking forlorn
this is shaping up to be a crap day
hhgg rd revised draft its about to get a lot crappier
there you are six pints
ford slaps down a note
the barmans impressed
keep the change
youve got ten minutes to spend it
ford pushes three pints in front of arthur
time is an illusion
lunchtime doubly so
you should send that in to the readers digest
theyve got a page for people like you
why three pints
grabbing more peanuts and eat these
youll need the salt
whats going on
what would you say if i told you i wasnt really from guilford but from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of eetelgeuse
why is it the sort of thing youre likely to say
remember when we met
that car was racing toward me i was trying to greet it you pushed me out of the way
hhgg rd revised draft ford stands in the middle of the road extending a hand to a fast approaching car
arthur drops his shopping dives at him and tackles him out of the way as the car zooms past
cont back to ford in the pub cont didnt you find it a little strange that i was trying to shake hands with a car
i assumed you were drunk
shaking his head i thought cars were the dominant life form
i was trying to introduce myself
and thats why youre named after a discontinued car from the seventies
nodding you saved my life that day
now im saving yours
arthur just stares at him then turns to his beer
this must be thursday
i never could get the hang of thursdays
look if its about your house
no its not that
he shows ford the photo of he and tricia on his phone
i found her
the perfect girl
i found her and then i let her get away
you remember that fancy dress party i told you about
this isnt a long story is it
weve only got six minutes
arthur shakes his head
ford checks his watch
hhgg rd revised draft okay
talk and drink
fancy dress party
at that flat in islington
i told you about it
last week remember
everyone is in costume
loud music blares
i cant bear those sort of parties didnt want to go would have much rather stayed home and i dont know brush the dog
but there i was and then there she was
arthur dressed in safari attire complete with pith helmet sits off to the side observing looking miserable
who are you
arthur looks up
tricia mcmillan is dressed in a mid th century mens suit with mutton chop sideburns and is holding a taxidermy beagle and she still looks beautiful
arthur ever the gentleman stands
no i mean who are you
oh the costume
sheepishly tipping his hat livingston i presume
pointing to her attire granted
not as clever as darwin but the best i could do on short notice
youre the first person whos got it right
everyone keeps calling me sherlock
i thought the beagle made it rather obvious
hhgg rd revised draft really
i thought the beagle made it rather obvious
he pets the dog
he smiles back
a camera flash flashes
jump cut to
the balcony arthur has just taken a digital photo of he and tricia on his cell phone
they look at the screen image and laugh
she was amazing ford
witty and beautiful and brilliant
four or five degrees
one in math one in astrophysics another in biology
ive got so many degrees i am officially unemployable
lets drink to that
they clink their wine glasses take sips continue to chat
and just as i was asking myself why is this stunning and intelligent woman even giving me the time of day out of nowhere she says
lets go somewhere
it is a bit noisy
theres a lovely little cafe around the corner
i was thinking madagascar
is that a new club on dean street
its a country
off the coast of africa
oh that madagascar
right off we go then
good god youre serious
hhgg rd revised draft she nods
arthur isnt sure how to react
an extraordinary proposition
i cant just up and go
what about my job
get a new one when we return
i cant just
what about my house
who would feed my dog
bring him with
hes a welsh collie
hed feel all out of place in madagascar
trillian forces a smile clearly disappointed
you dont want to go to madagascar
they both turn to face zaphod beeblebrox very charming extremely handsome whose attire seems very other worldly
knee high boots a yellow sash
im zaphod beeblebrox president of the galaxy of course you probably already know that
im headed for a lost and distant planet
would you like to see my spaceship
i went to refresh our drinks
when i came back she was gone
arthur stares into his beer plagued by this loss
would you like to see my spaceship
really what sort of chat up line is that
more popular than youd think
ive left messages sent letters
its like shes vanished off the face of the earth
hhgg rd revised draft hey it happens
pulling a blinking electronic device from his satchel weve got two minutes
so drink up
theres a roar of engines and a loud crash outside
arthur and everyone else in the pub look up
he runs out
ford rises grabs two handfuls of peanuts from the bowl tosses the barman all the money in his pocket
a round for everyone on me
you really think the worlds going to end
ford nods shouldnt we lie down or put a bag over our heads or something
if you want
will it help
he gives everyone in the bar a friendly salute exits
last orders then
arthur runs up the road towards his house which is being bulldozed
ford strides casually behind in the distance
arthur suddenly stops running and covers his ears as we hear the loudest rumble in motion picture history
a a gigantic yellow spaceship picture a concrete tower a block sweeps overhead
ford hits the deck
arthur is blown sideways
trees are uprooted
ford rises and hurries to the rubble that was arthurs house
he digs around near the exposed toilet and comes up with a towel
he hurries to arthurs side
hhgg rd revised draft a continued a another ship screams over blowing them down again
rain is knocked out of the clouds and lands in one big thwump
everywhere is soaked
ships from a vogon constructor fleet
i picked up their signal this morning
he shows arthur his blinking sens matic device
youll need this
he tosses arthur the towel
then he removes a short black rod his electronic thumb
he sticks it out
picture mission control in houston
monitors line the wall showing hundreds of news reports from around the globe panic chaos and pandemonium
suddenly theres a loud hum through the speakers followed by loud gargles and screeching
people of earth this is prostetnic vogon jeltz of the galactic hyperspace planning council
a family at breakfast baffled that their cutlery bowls and glasses resonate with the sound of jeltzs voice
as you are probably aware plans for the development of the outlying regions of the galaxy involve the building of a hyperspace express route through your star system
several patrons watch the wall of tvs all projecting a snowy distorted image
jeltzs voice blares through the speakers
and unfortunately your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition
the process will take slightly less than two of your earth minutes
through the window behind them throngs of people stampede down oxford street screaming
hhgg rd revised draft a technician speaks urgently into a microphone while his co workers watch the chaos on the monitors behind
can you hear us
the vogon bridge is like a waterlogged old skoda
theres no point in acting all surprised about it
the plans and demolition orders have been on display at your local planning office in alpha centauri for fifty of your earth years so youve had plenty of time to
lodge formal complaints
ford grabs hold of arthurs shirt extends the thumb
pull back from juke box
the pub seems deserted
through juke box what do you mean youve never been to alpha centauri
oh for heavens sake mankind its only four light years away you know
im sorry but if you cant be bothered to take an interest in local affairs thats your own lookout
pull back farther people lay on the ground with paper bags on their heads
hes large green and walrusy
apathetic bloody planet ive no sympathy at all
energize the demolition beams
one of his walrusy first officers pushes a yellow button
as all the vogon ships simultaneously send down a beam of yellow light
glowing fireballs travel down the beams toward earth
on impact they bore into the surface
hhgg rd revised draft like a giant casino going down in vegas there are a few small explosions amd the earth implodes
just collapses in on itself
the vogon ships slowly retreat in formation leaving nothing but darkness and stars
then a distant red glow appears
as it gets nearer we see that it says
the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy
the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy is a wholly remarkable book
the title draws nearer
we see that it sits on an electronic book with lots of buttons
perhaps the most remarkable certainly the most successful book ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of ursa minor
the book opens revealing two screens
a star map layers of data captions video animations
more popular than the celestial home care omnibus better selling than more things to do in zero gravity and more controversial than oolon colluphids trilogy of philosophical blockbusters greatest mistakes
and who is this god now the images rise up from the screen like holographs as the book presents itself like some hi tech infomercial
in many of the more relaxed civilizations on the outer eastern rim of the galaxy the hitchhikers guide has already supplanted the great encyclopedia galactica as the standard repository of
all knowledge and wisdom
for though it has many omissions and contains much which is apocryphal or at least wildly inaccurate it scores over the older more pedestrian work in two important respects
first it is slightly cheaper
and second it has the words dont panic printed in large friendly letters on its cover
the book closes
the words dont panic appear just below the title blinking like a tacky diner marquee
pull back from the guide to find arthur holding it the blinking light illuminating his very disoriented face
hhgg rd revised draft arthur in total shock holds up the guide
so youre not from guilford which would explain the accent which ive always wondered about
and youre not an out of work actor but rather a writer for this
arthur rubs his weary brow
i dont feel well
i need a cup of tea
ford hands him a fistful of peanuts
if youve never been through a transmat beam before youve probably lost some salt and protein
arthur eats some peanuts sits up squints
ford feels his way around the room looking for something
if i asked where we were would i regret were safe
were in a storage hold in one of the ships of the vogon constructor fleet
obviously some strange usage of the word safe i wasnt previously aware of
not getting the sarcasm is it
tell me youre joking
and do a reassuring little laugh
ford does a reassuring little laugh
now tell me where we really are
hhgg rd revised draft in the storage hold of a vogon constructor ship
ford continues his search
arthurs breathing quickens
get me home
oh god it was demolished
ive got to reach my lawyer
he must be back from lunch by now
he pulls out his cell phone
desperately punches numbers
ford flips on a light switch revealing a messy chamber full of alien junk and old mattresses
you dont remember do you
taking his cell phone okay
ive got something to tell you
it aint gonna be easy but youre gonna have to just deal okay
is this really the interior of a flying saucer
well its a bit squalid isnt it
hey man youre in denial
jeltz consults one screen after another
at last he sees ford and arthur
his walrusy eyes narrow
couldnt you have done something
i saved you
hhgg rd revised draft but theres six billion other people
and all those ants
yes but ants arent exactly people
and now youre thinking like a vogon
before arthur can respond i saved your life okay
which makes us even
ford throws arthur a towel
arthur looks confused
its a tough galaxy
you want to survive out here you really gotta know where your towel is
now gimme a hand over here
arthur joins ford near a rusty ventilation pipe
careful its hot
he slides the towel behind the pipe holding each end of it arthur does the same
weve got to get off this ship before the vogons find us
vogons hate hitchhikers
which is why they make ships with walls that wont allow the sub etna signal to pass through
so weve got to send the signal up and out if we wanna catch a ride
they both pull
a section of pipe snaps off
steam shoots out
ford holds the black thumb under the pipe
whats a vogon
ask the guide
ford continues turning dials
arthur lifts the guide
the word vogons floats up into his field of vision
hhgg rd revised draft what to avoid
arthur touches character
vogons are one of the most unpleasant races in the galaxy not evil but bad tempered bureaucratic officious and callous
they wouldnt even lift a finger to save their own grandmothers from the ravenous bugblatter beast of traal without orders signed in triplicate sent in sent back queried lost found
subjected to public inquiry lost again and finally buried in soft peat for three months and recycled as fire lighters
arthur touches how to have fun with
the best way to get a drink out of a vogon is to stick your finger down his throat
arthur touches what to avoid
on no account should you allow a vogon to read poetry to you
they cant think they cant imagine most of them cant even spell
they just run things
turns dial opposite direction and if we dont get a ride soon you wont b need the guide to illustrate just how unpleasant the vogons can be
theyve destroyed a planet today that always makes them a little feisty
it cant be gone
it cant be
grabbing the guide shouting earth
an image of the earth appears on the guides screen
the earth image fades away
hhgg rd revised draft thats it
thats all this idiotic book has to say about my home
hey there are a hundred billion stars in the galaxy and only a limited amount of space in the books microprocessors
no one knew much about earth
thats why i was there
to expand the entry
i fired off a new one to the editor before i got stranded
what does it say now
before arthur can react a speaker hums to life with screeching howls and gargles
arthur cups his ears
ahhh what the hell is that
put this in your ear
ford removes a small yellow fish from his pouch
he moves to put it in arthurs ear
the loud gargling noise continues
ford has to wrestle to get the fish in arthurs ear
as he succeeds the noise mutates to the vogon captains voice
arthur looks incredulous
this is your captain speaking so stop whatever youre doing and pay attention
its translating for you
according to our instruments we have unwittingly picked up a couple of hitchhikers who must be apprehended and
hhgg rd revised draft arthur doesnt want to hear any of this
pulls the fish back out of his ear
ford struggles shoves it back in arthurs ear again
and this is not a taxi service for degenerate freeloaders
the door bursts open
a vogon guard enters
grabs ford and arthur
resistance is useless
the struggle continues
as theyre dragged out the door arthur continues to try to yank the fish out of his ear
ford wrestles with him trying to keep it in
the babelfish is small yellow leechlike and probably the oddest thing in the universe
a bleak corridor
the vogon guard pushes a still struggling arthur and ford down it
it feeds on brainwave energy absorbing unconscious frequencies and excreting a matrix of conscious frequencies to the speech centres of the brain the practical upshot of which is that if
you stick one in your ear you instantly understand anything said to you in any language
arthur continues to struggle until he passes a portal window
he backs up to look out
now it is such a bizarrely improbable thing that anything so mind bogglingly useful could have evolved in the universe purely by chance that many thinkers have chosen to see
this as a final clinching proof of the non existence of god
a arthurs pov of space through the window beautiful a purple orange clouds of swirling stars and gasses
the argument goes something like this
i refuse to prove that i exist says god for proof denies faith and without faith i am nothing
hhgg rd revised draft a continued a its finally sinking in hes in deep space
but says man the babelfish is a dead give away
it proves you exist and so therefore you dont
oh dear says god i hadnt thought of that and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic
the guard yanks arthur away pushes him forward with ford
most leading theologians claim that this argument is a load of dingos kidneys but that didnt stop oolon colluphid from making a small fortune when he used it as the
central theme of his best selling book arthur looks lost and confused
they approach a set of double doors
the guard shoves him forward
resistance is useless
if were lucky theyll throw us out into space
and if were unlucky
off fords apprehensive look we cut to
arthur and ford are strapped against two concrete pillars with hundreds of elastic bands
looks like an instrument of torture
as the device descends jeltz fishes a jeweled crab out of a gunky trough and smashes it with a hammer blam
jeltz takes the device in his hand then blows in it
we hear feedback
its a microphone like ones used to introduce boxers
he taps it
this thing on
he faces them holds up a book entitled
smirks then begins to read vogon poetry
oh freddled gruntbuggly
thy suppurations are to me as plerdled gabbleblotchits on a lurgid bee
ford writhes in pain as does arthur but less so
hhgg rd revised draft vogon poetry is widely accepted as the third worst in the universe
ford vibrates like hes having an epileptic seizure
arthur just looks like he has a migraine
the second worst is that of the azgoths of kria
during a recitation by their poet master grunthos the flatulent of his poem ode to a small lump of green putty i found in my armpit one midsummer morning four
of his audience died of internal hemorrhaging and the president of the mid galactic arts nobbling council survived by gnawing one of his own legs off
spasms wrack fords body
or i shall rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurglecruncheaon see if i dont
fords entire body tenses arches then goes limp
arthur lets out an audible sigh as the poem ends
the absolute worst poetry was written by paula nancy millstone jennings of sussix
it involved decaying swans
luckily it was destroyed when the earth was
so earthlings i present you with a simple choice
either die in the vacuum of space or tell what you thought of my poem
ford is spent cant say a word
arthur looks up
i rather liked it
jeltz looks surprised
ford notices whispers to arthur
run with it
some of the words i didnt understand but i found the imagery quite effective
hhgg rd revised draft and um interesting rhythmic devices which seemed to counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor of the humanity
vogonity of the poets soul which contrives through the medium of the verse structure to sublimate er
whatever it was
the poem was about
jeltz rubs one of his chins then smiles and claps slowly
i think you just saved my life again
an astute analysis
turning to the guard throw them off the ship
the guard grabs them drags them out of the bridge
resistance is useless
counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor
deaths too good for them
jeltz picks up his fishing rod goes for another crab
the guard shoves them into the airlock
they sit panting
arthur stares forward
so this is it
were going to die
hhgg rd revised draft yes
whats this switch
reaching for it no its nothing
we are going to die
arthur sits for a moment then oddly chuckles to himself
you know its at times like this when im trapped in a vogon airlock with a man from betelgeuse and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that i
really wish id listened to what my mother told me when i was young
what did you she tell you
i dont know
i didnt listen
ford folds his towel into a tiny square holds it up toward arthur
he raises an eyebrow
will this help
ford dabs arthurs brow
they stare forward at the airlock door
they look to each other
they might be okay
the bottom drops out
theyre sucked down and out
ford and arthur spin away from the ship holding their breath
the guide slips out of arthurs pocket
says the introduction to the hitchhikers guide
you just wont believe how vastly hugely mind bogglingly big it is
i mean you may think its a long way down the road to the market but thats just peanuts compared to space
and so on
the weightless guide twirls away
arthur reaches for it
the words dont panic alight
it also says that if you hold a lung full of air you can survive in the total vacuum of space for about thirty seconds but with space being really
big and all the chances of being picked up within that time are to the power of to against
hhgg rd revised draft something else falls out of his pocket his digital phone with the photo of he and tricia at the fancy dress party
which by a staggering coincidence is also the telephone number of the islington flat where arthur once went to a fancy dress party and met a very nice girl whom
he totally failed to connect with
he reaches for the phone its just beyond his fingertips
his eyes widen with fret as the phone tumbles away
a then woomph space seems to stretch and bend
a tiny a hole appears then opens wide
paper hats and party balloons fall out then drift away
the hole flips inside out
arthur and ford are enveloped then replaced by a stunning sleek starship the heart of gold
two to the power of one hundred thousand to one against and falling
in the middle of this hi tech receiving bay sit two ornate golden brocade sofas
through speakers two to the power of ten thousand to one against and falling
the sofas shake a little
i think im a sofa
i think i know how you feel
a long pause
both sofas begin to thrash in panic
five to one against and falling
a pair of arms and legs pop out of each sofa
four to one against and falling
hhgg rd revised draft a close on a monitor on which plays a news report
a and of course the top story is still the sensational theft of the new improbability drive prototype ship heart of gold last week stolen at the launch ceremony by
none other than galactic president zaphod beeblebrox
so in the name of the people and freedom and i dunno democracy and stuff like that i hereby declare this ship officially stolen
pull back to reveal zaphod beeblebrox leaning toward the tv watching with a very satisfied grin
three to one
two to one
annoyed he turns
theres a woman with red hair trillian her back to him reading numbers off a console display and speaking into a microphone
into microphone probability factor of one to one
we have normality i repeat we have normality
anything you still cant cope with is therefore your own problem
you will be sent for soon
do you mind
i cant hear
trillian turns and we now recognize her as tricia from the fancy dress party
her hair is shorter and bright red
she looks amazing
can we put your ego aside for one moment
something important has happened
if theres anything more important than my ego on this ship i want it caught and shot now
he turns back to the tv and turns it up
the question everyone seems to be asking is has the big z finally flipped
we asked his private brain care specialist gag halfrunt
vell zaphods just zis guy you know
hhgg rd revised draft the tv suddenly clicks off
trillians holding a remote
we have a couple of hitchhikers in our receiving bay
his head jerks upwards
he quickly grabs it with his hands and shoves it back down
i didnt pick them up
the ship did
when you engaged the improbability drive
i didnt engage the drive
we picked them up in sector zz plural z alpha where you picked me up
just very very improbable
i dont have time for this
weve got the police of half the galaxy after us and we stop to pick up hitchhikers
okay so ten out of ten for style but minus several million for good thinking eh
he reaches for a hi tech gun on the wall
she stops him
ill send marvin
zaphod rolls his eyes as a humanoid robot rises from its seat behind them
this is marvin
he trudges slump shouldered toward zaphod
i think you ought to know im feeling very depressed
we have something to take your mind off things
hhgg rd revised draft it wont work i have an exceptionally large mind
go down to the number two entry bay and bring the two aliens up here
i wont enjoy it
shes not asking you to enjoy it
just do it will you
ill do it
marvin turns and trudges away
then he turns again
im not getting you down at all am i
no no marvin its fine really
its just part of life
dont talk to me about life
marvin trudges away
a door slides open for him and makes an audible satisfied sigh as it does
the heart of gold cruises around a bright star
a light blinks on a console
a vogon captain turns a dial listens through his head set
he punches a few buttons
commander kwaltz green and walrusy like jeltz appears on the large monitor sitting in his chair at command headquarters
weve located the spaceship heart of gold and president beeblebrox
sector zz plural z alpha
requesting hyperspace clearance
hhgg rd revised draft hold your position captain until clearance is granted
kwaltz sits at the end of a concrete war room table
get me the vice president
approximately vogons sit around the table murmuring sporadically
a vogon messenger runs up holding papers
kwaltz takes them signs signs the next page and the next
he hands them back to the messengers who has been jogging in place the whole time
he runs off
the vogon captain appears on the large screen before him
hyperspace permission granted captain
a hundred rectangular vogon ships blast forward
arthur looks around and notices the room is gleaming white hi tech brand new plastic still on some stuff
now this is more like my idea of a spaceship
look at all these buttons
he pushes a button
the door slides open with a satisfied sigh hhhmmyaaaahhh
as they walk through
a int hog corridor night a thank you for using this door
ive enjoyed opening for you
they leap through to the other side as the door closes
ghastly isnt it
they whip around to find marvin standing before them
hhgg rd revised draft a continued a ive been ordered to take you up to the bridge
here i am brain the size of a planet and they ask me to take you up to the bridge
call that job satisfaction
cause i dont
marvin turns and walks away
they shrug to each other and follow
marvin passes through another door that opens with the same sigh hhmmaaaahhh what a pleasure it is to open for you
i will gladly close for you now
the door closes
all the doors in this spacecraft have a cheerful and sunny disposition
it is their pleasure to open for you and their satisfaction to close again with the knowledge of a job well done
the door repeats its whole closing and opening routine again
hateful isnt it
you can thank the marketing division of the sirius cybernetics corporation for building robots with gpp
genuine people personalities
im a personality prototype
you can tell cant you
sorry did i say something wrong
pardon me for breathing which i never do anyway so i dont know why i even bother to say it
oh god im so depressed
they round a corner
hhgg rd revised draft a continued a and then ive got this terrible pain in all the diodes down my left side
ive asked for them to be replaced but no one ever listens
aside to arthur probably because hes so negative
yes i know
i was being
they continue on
hanging on the wall is the official presidential portrait featuring zaphod who sports a very smart suit and a fake politicians smile
tilt down to the door which opens mmyyahhh
to reveal ford arthur and marvin
ive brought the aliens
dont thank me or anything
zaphod spins around in his chair holding a gun but sporting that same politically correct smile
arthur and ford throw their hands up
do you mean sit in a corner and rust or just fall apart where im standing
i wasnt talking to you
it is you
zaphod gives ford a big bear hug
he pulls away then playfully punches ford in the arm
praxibetel ix you zarking hoopy
what the hell are you doing here
i dont know
just stuck out the thumb and here i am
hhgg rd revised draft that is so you
and look at you
last time i saw you you were a beach bum
is it a great galaxy or what
punching his arm again i still cant believe this
hey its ford now
its ford prefect
picked it up on earth
sorta grew on me
okay ford you zarking frood
they embrace tussle punch arms
they bump into arthur
oh this is arthur
arthur this is zaphod beeblebrox
semi half brother
he shares three of the same mothers as me
ive got a terrible memory for species
before arthur can explain trillian enters
you wont believe this
she takes a closer look at him
hhgg rd revised draft arthur is stunned silent
he goes to her making sure shes really there
she smiles and gives him a friendly embrace
completely bewildered i cant believe this
ive been looking
and youre here
i went to get wine and
and it was rude to just leave but i told you i wanted to get away and he had a spaceship parked outside well honestly i assumed you were a
sort of stay at home and read a book type
hopeful but youre here
arthur smiles then realizes with some regret
actually i am that type
well you do know what happened dont you
zaphod stops in between them puts his arm around arthur
ford picked him up they hitched a ride and here we all are
now enough small talk trill
were on the run remember
i stole a ship
were having a bit of a chat if you dont mind
arthur shoves zaphods hand off his shoulder
oddly zaphod reacts with a smile
and then his head shoots all the up way revealing a second head that lives somewhere under his chin
you blew it with her earthman so shut up or ill kick you in the gones
theres the zaphod i remember
arthur recoils in horror instinctively raises his fists
zaphod wrestles with head while a third arm springs out of zaphods chest and punches arthur in the jaw
arthur buckles and hits the floor
you should teach your pal a lesson ford
hes a guest on my ship
i thought you said you stole it
hhgg rd revised draft fine
a klaxon sounds
red lights flash
zaphod head hurries to the console
trillian hurries to arthur who nurses his jaw
are you all right
i feel like a bloody idiot
ive spent all week looking for tricia mcmillan and that isnt even your name
it is my name
i shortened it
well im still arthur
just plain average one headed doesnt own a space ship arthur
sorry to disappoint
a little help over here
trillian leaves arthur joins zaphod theyre after us
fire a gun
launch a missile
do some damage
zaphods arms struggle with his head again
a quick shot
deep space a a dull gray rectangular vogon battle cruiser is easing up behind the heart of gold
behind the cruiser is about one hundred other battle ships flying in formation
cont back on the bridge cont computer
a very eager male computer voice eddie sounds
hi guys this is eddie your shipboard computer and i just know im gonna get a bundle of kicks out of any program you want to run through me
can you identify our pursuers
hhgg rd revised draft id be happy to
stand by please
cheesy on hold muzak plays hey guys im just pleased as punch to report that its a fleet of a hundred vogon battle destroyers
you must be super important to warrant such an effort and gee am i impressed
theyre sending a message
id be super happy to play it
to trillian this people personality thing is gonna drive me nuts
cant you change it
an image appears on the ships monitor vice president questular rontok flanked by vogon commander kwaltz at h
he looks reluctant
he has to say this
this is vice president questular rontok
i am speaking to the kidnapper of the president
surrender your stolen vessel at once or we will take action as defined and permitted by section
of the galactic interstellar space bi laws
leap to hyperspace
sure thing fella but i should tell you we need proper authorization before entering a hyperspace expressway
or else what
theyll send a hundred and one ships
he and trillian buckle up
ford turns to arthur
this is a bit like being drunk
whats so bad about being drunk
ask a glass of water
they are stretched and squeezed by extraordinary forces
questular and kwaltz watch their front screen as the heart of gold blasts into hyperspace
hhgg rd revised draft did they have proper hyperspace authorization
add that to their list of offences
scoffing blatant disregard for protocol
you do realize he did what he did because he knew this is what you would do
rules are rules mr
and they are made to be followed
questular looks up to the screen at all the vogon ships
dont you think this many ships is a bit oh i dont know excessive
the provisions are clear
under subsection a these are the forces we deploy to protect the president in the case of an attempted or actual kidnapping he holds up one fat official book with
and these are the forces we deploy to apprehend any intentional or actual kidnapper
he holds up another fat book with the other
you are aware commander that the president kidnapped himself
he puts the two books together slams them down
do you have any idea how ridiculous this is
i dont have ideas mr
i just do what i do
a vogon messenger runs up holding papers
kwaltz takes them signs one in two places initials others lifts the top sheet removes the pink copy
hhgg rd revised draft he does this for the other two forms as well
questular watches dumbfounded as kwaltz hands the papers back to the messenger who turns and runs off
the heart of gold comes out of hyperspace and slows to cruising speed
no vogons in sight
zaphods head is still up beaming
damn im good
hands slam head down
zaphod head turns to ford
so you along for the ride or am i dropping you somewhere
still wary of the two heads depends
where you going
into the pages of history cousin
and when you see what im about to show you youll beg me to take you with us
with trillian who notices arthur looking ill
normally i would say ill live but given the circumstances
wiping his brow is there any tea on this spaceship
zaphod steps back blocking his way
im sorry what was your name again
hhgg rd revised draft right
no hard feelings okay
and sorry to hear about your planet but dont mention it to the girl because if you do ill
he smiles broader
then head pops up and finishes
ill pull your spleen out through your ass
zaphod slams head back into place
then smiles again
arthur furrows his brow and zaphod and follows trillian
apparently you cant be president with a whole brain
so you carved it up
yes i think
and i think i did it in such a way that it wouldnt be detected by the government screening tests or by me
so whats so secret that i cant let anybody know i know it not the galactic government not even myself
and the answer is thinking i dont know
but i put a few things together and thats when i realized i had this
he points to the cobalt blue cube on his gold necklace
close on the nutri matic machine
brownish liquid flows into it a martini glass topped with dry ice fog
arthur removes the glass
grimaces i suppose i should have said it resembles tea
so two heads is what does it for a girl then
i mean if id had two heads
or your own space ship
hhgg rd revised draft anything else hes got two of
come on arthur dont be like that
well what am i supposed to be like
just be yourself
have some fun
does it hurt
no i suppose it wouldnt
she points to his jaw he nods she picks up her backpack
i might have an aspirin
she unzips it
two mice scurry out and scamper off a hair clip is clipped to one of the mices tail
what are they doing in there
before she can catch them they scurry under the door
they were from my lab at university
so all thats left is me and you mostly harmless and two lab rats
she furrows her brow
what does he mean
look theres something i should tell you
can it keep
you might want to see this
he looks at his tea throws it in the trash bin
hhgg rd revised draft trillian and arthur join ford and zaphod at the computer
and when i saw what im about to show you thats when i realized why i did what i did to my brain or it least i think thats why
the screen brightens
a brand logo appears a circle made of a dotted line with an m in the middle then a sub title magrathean public archive
zaphod fast forwards until a noisy picture dissolves to
a procession surrounds a chariot
two young philosophers lunkwill and fook s ride it into a grand temple
the aisles are lined with priest technicians
ahead is deep thought a huge buddha esque computer
the procession peels away to both sides
lunkwill and fook dismount and approach
deep and sonorous what is this great task for which i deep thought the second greatest computer of all time have been called into existence
your task o computer
did you say second greatest
but we designed you to be the greatest computer so you could
youre not talking about the milliard gargantubrain which can count all the atoms in a star in a millisecond
the milliard gargantubrain
a mere abacus mention it not
the omnicognate neutron wrangler then
hhgg rd revised draft the omnicognate neutron wrangler could argue all four legs off an arcturan megadonkey but only i could persuade it to go for a walk afterwards
then whats the problem
i am the greatest computer you are able to design without my help
which one day you are going to need
to fook lets just ask the question
oh deep thought your task is this
we want you to tell us the answer
deep thought bleeps and bloops
wed really like an answer
can you do it
the ultimate question of life the universe and everything
there is an answer
but ill have to think about it
lunkwill glances at his time piece fook at the expectant throng behind them
return to this place in exactly
seven and a half million years
the screen goes to snow
ford and arthur look confused
hhgg rd revised draft no no
they go back
seven and a half million years later
zaphod nods hits play
we push back in on the screen
lunkwill and fook enter the now modern temple flanked by a crowd
they have beards and look like theyre in their s
deep thought rises looks lifeless
worried mutters from the crowd
slowly deep thought groans to life
can i help you
do you have
an answer for you
there really is an answer
there really is one
almost strangled with emotion oh
can you tell us what it is
though i dont think youre going to like it
we must know it
youre really not going to like it
the answer to the ultimate question
hhgg rd revised draft of life the universe and everything
longest pause yet forty two
the surrounding crowd is stunned
i checked it thoroughly
it would have been simpler of course to have known what the actual question was
but it was the question
the ultimate question
yes but what actually is it
thats not a question
only when you know what the actual question will you know what the answer means
give us the ultimate question then
long pause but there is one who can
a computer that is to come after me one that i will design
a computer to calculate the ultimate question one of such infinite complexity that life itself will form part of its operational matrix
and you yourselves shall take on new more primitive forms and go down into the computer to navigate its ten million year program
i shall design this computer for you
and it shall be called
the picture distorts and whites out
hhgg rd revised draft zaphod hits eject
the blue cube rises
youre looking for the ultimate question
no i tried that
to trillian lets get her ready babe
he moves to a different rack of instruments consults a check list starts flipping some switches
i mean why do you want to know the ultimate question
well partly the curiosity partly a sense of adventure but mostly i think its for the fame and the money
he continues preparing the ship
trillian consults the huge manual turning dials flipping switches
but youre president of the galaxy arent you
presidential fame is temporary i find the question thats permanent
plus everyone thinks youre deep
hhgg rd revised draft but you dont know the name of the computer that other computer was talking about
which is why im going there
to find deep thought
magrathea is a myth a legend
no it isnt
its real cousin
and this is the only ship in the universe that can get you there
realizing you mean to tell me you carved up your brain so you could become president so you would get invited to the launching ceremony of this ship
so you could steal it
so you could go to magrathea which according to most sane people doesnt even exist
why this ship
whats so special about it
zaphod thinks again hard
i dont seem to be letting myself in on any of my secrets
because of this obviously
they turn to see trillian flipping open a glass lid revealing a big red button
ford reads the glowing letters above the button
hhgg rd revised draft reading infinite improbability drive
so they finally built one that works
and thats how we got picked up
and im guessing if we hit that button we go to magrathea
hey anyone whos not up for that theres the door
now whos in
for a trip to a place that doesnt exist
my editor will think im crazy but what the hell he already thinks im dead
he takes out the guide
zaphod looks to trillian
theyre all standing together
they turn to arthur
arthur looks to trillian
she stares back waiting
do i even have a choice
zaphod smiles all bright and cheery
arthur looks at the button
what exactly does an infinite improbability drive do
suddenly zaphods head shoots up
zaphods third arm shoots out and smacks the button
improbability drive effect as the ship flips across space and disappears leaving nothing but shimmers
hhgg rd revised draft the infinite improbability drive is a new method of crossing vast interstellar distances without all that tedious mucking about in hyperspace
as soon as the drive reaches infinite improbability it passes through every conceivable point in every conceivable universe almost simultaneously then selects the appropriate re entry point
the principle of generating small amounts of finite improbability by hooking the logic circuits of a bambleweeny sub meson brain to an atomic vector plotter suspended in a strong brownian
motion producer say a nice hot cup of tea were of course well understood
seconds later the vogon destroyer comes out of hyperspace and slows to cruising speed
vogon controllers and copilots turn dials and push buttons scrambling to regain a signal
such generators were often used to break the ice at parties by making all the molecules in the hostesss undergarments leap simultaneously one foot to the left in accordance with
the theory of indeterminacy
kwaltz and questular appear on the monitor
controllers turn more dials trying to find the ship
many respectable physicists said they werent going to stand for that sort of thing partly because it was a debasement of science but mostly because they didnt get invited to
those sort of parties
we had them sir
these are the coordinates
but theyre not here
i can see that
where are they
the captain shrugs
kwaltz heaves a walrusy sigh
hhgg rd revised draft we hover above a greenish purplish planet
improbability effect space ripples
something begins to materialize something big and gray tumbling toward us
we now see the big gray thing is a giant rhinoceros which ripples flips inside out and becomes the heart of gold
heart of gold
bridge night a a knitted version of arthur trillian ford and zaphod sit in chairs before the ships console
clutching stomach is this going to happen every time we hit that button
very probably yes
the air ripples
the knitted crew flip back to their former selves
arthur pukes into a trash bin and with a sick expression looks up to the screen
did it work
are we there
now zaphod looks and hes elated
head suddenly springs up
can you please change that zarking annoying voice
what planet is that please
on hold muzak plays
they all sit and listen for a few beats then arthur yelps
spinning around to zaphod did you just pluck a hair from my head
yeah as if apeman
hhgg rd revised draft arthur suddenly feels something on his back leaps out of the chair and brushes it off
the two mice land on the floor across the ship then scurry away down a hallway
before arthur can react
thanks for waiting everyone
im just tickled pink to tell you we are currently in orbit around the planet viltvodle
push in on zaphod whos nd head suddenly shoots up
vogon crew quickly enter data
a flight engineer gets something on his screen shows it to the captain
sir the heart of gold has just requested permission to land on viltvodle
should i pursue
that is not a request to which i can respond captain
should i pursue what
are you requesting hyperspace clearance so that you may pursue the fugitive
then you must say that captain in request form
requesting hyperspace clearance to pursue the fugitive sir
into microphone bring me the request to pursue fugitive forms
the war room is silent
we hear the sound of running above
the footsteps hurry all the way around we hear a door open running up more steps along the corridor until and finally an exhausted vogon messenger bursts through the door
holding a blue form
questular shakes his head in disbelief as kwaltz signs the request form
hhgg rd revised draft this is ridiculous
what do you need an executive order
i order you
stop doing this
go and get him
according to subsection b paragraph youre not authorized to make such an order
but im acting president
then act like a president and do nothing
kwaltz continues to fill out the forms
questular grabs a clump of his hair and pulls it out
all we can see are the lights of the heart of golds entry ramp cutting through a dense fog
or is it fog
zaphods nd head is up as he comes down the ramp ahead of the other three
why does he keep saying that
i dont know
im not used to seeing him this way
you mean fully clothed
she stops fires him a look
sorry but i cant for the life of me figure out why you the most brilliant woman i have ever met have ended up with that half witted self obsessed
i mean look at him
they squint through the fog at zaphod head out
his hands keep trying to get it down but the rd arm keeps whacking them away
he disappears into the fog
hhgg rd revised draft clearly unlike any guy ive ever met
back to arthur look if youre going to pout your way around space then maybe you should just go home
thats the whole point and ive been trying to tell you
interrupting hey look what i found in the guide
he hands the guide to trillian
she keeps walking
i wouldnt tell her if i were you
she deserves to know
but if you tell her and she ends up with you because youre literally the last guy on earth youll always doubt her intentions
arthur considers this
got your towel
do i need it
ford puts his towel to his mouth as they follow trillian down the mist covered street
shes reading the guide
in the beginning the universe was created
this made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move
zaphod continues several steps ahead of them
many races believe that it was created by some sort of god though the jatravartid people of viltvodle firmly believe that the entire universe was in fact sneezed out of
the nose of a being called the great green arkleseizure
the jatravartids who live in perpetual fear
hhgg rd revised draft of the time they call the coming of great white handkerchief are small blue creatures with more than fifty arms each
who are therefore unique in being the only race in history to have invented the aerosol deodorant before the wheel
zaphods two arms shove his chin back down
ill handle this
seedy street viltvodle a the others approach watching zaphod as he stops a passing an eight armed alien creature asks him something oozing charm
the creature points down the street with arms then with others hands him a pen and paper
zaphod signs an autograph and moves on
the alien beams then squirts three cans of aerosol under several arms
more mist rises
follow it up revealing a large building a temple with two giant arches
the others follow
camera tilts up and we see this building looks like a nose lying horizontally the giant arches are the nostrils
zaphod opens the huge doors inside the large nostril arches
a rush of air blows the mist past ford trillian and arthur a few steps behind
a congregation of worshipers faces front where humma kavula stands behind a podium
hes a humanoid wearing a white robe and night vision sun glasses
the handkerchief is coming beloveds
are you ready
let us pray that the almighty will exhale a breath of compassion on us
instead of bowing they all point their noses heavenward
zaphod marches down the center aisle while humma prays
almighty arkleseizure we lift our noses clogged and unblown in reverence to you
zaphod stops a few feet away from hummas chair
hhgg rd revised draft thats humma kavula
i thought he was just using a swear word
shaking his head humma kavula was his opponent in the election
something happened during the campaign
zaphod never forgave him
what was it
humma looks up sees zaphod smiles
wrapping up the prayer send the handkerchief lord so that it may wipe us clean
we ask this in your precious holy name
and they all sneeze
akin to crossing himself humma raises a hand to his nose then down again
hummas quarters are opulent
he sits behind his desk flanked by several armed body guards
ford arthur and trillian keep a safe distance as zaphod faces off with humma who has the air of a cool news anchor man
zaphod beeblebrox our famous president
the arkleseizure has exhaled many blessings upon you
what brings you to our humble planet
i think you know why im here
i dont think i do
oh i think you think you dont but we both know you do
elequent as always zaphod
your ability to communicate a clear thought never ceases to amaze
hhgg rd revised draft head suddenly springs up to the surprise of all
you called me stupid
re the heads interesting
and i dont know what youre talking about
during the campaign humma you said i was stupid
this humma you speak of no longer exists
he came here in his consolation position as ambassador to gamma z to squelch an ideological threat to the system and repented from his wicked ways
he now goes by the holy name tazelo the unceasingly righteous given to him by his devoted followers
the rd arm reaches for a gun in zaphods vest
the body guards aim their weapons
one runs up and smacks zaphod in the back of the head slamming head back in place
the rd arm disappears
the gun falls
a body guard picks it up
why do i get the feeling hes going to get us all killed
probably because its very possible
just dont save me okay
humma lays his palms on the table and lifts himself as if to stand but there is nothing of him below the table line except for thirty one inch metal
legs attached to the base of his torso
he glides towards zaphod the little legs extending to reach the floor as he reaches the end of the table
hhgg rd revised draft the election is ancient history zaphod but if memory serves you won proving that good looks and charm win over brilliance and ability to govern
a guard drapes a white robes over hummas shoulders which he ties with a belt hiding his peculiar undercarriage
and incidently you are stupid
his head jerks up
zaphod stops it paints on a smile
thats really not the point
you havent come halfway across the galaxy to settle a campaign grudge
why are you here zaphod
zaphod doesnt answer
humma motions to a guard who grabs his arm twists it hard
wincing i dont know
i was headed for magrathea i ended up here
push in on humma who raises his hi tech sun glasses
how very very
he pulls the nose off his body guard turns a key
a secret safe door slides open from the mans chest
i kept a few souvenirs from my former life
ah the heady days of space piracy
so young so foolish
another smaller box rises from the chest cabinet
inside we see glowing jewels a skeleton hand etc
humma removes a pink cube like zaphods blue cube
ill gladly give you the coordinates to magrathea
he holds up the pink cube revealing a series of coordinate numbers on each side
zaphod reaches for it
humma takes it back
provided you bring me something in return
hhgg rd revised draft what
a very special gun
designed by the greatest computer ever invented now buried in the bowels of magrathea
ill get your gun
just give me the coordinates
zaphod reaches out
humma pulls it back
and what will you give me to insure your return
my word as president
id be better off with the dung of a bethusian mega donkey
okay then ill get you that
i need a hostage something you hold dear
only what does zaphod beeblebrox treasure
on zaphods second head peeping out of the collar looking terrified
he signals the guards
they grab zaphod who looks back to trillian offers a weak smile
very fast scene two seconds
zaphods nd head screams
pull back to see it being lifted out of zaphods neck
zaphod unconscious on the operating table
blood and instruments everywhere
hhgg rd revised draft zaphods head hangs on the wall
wires feed out of the neck into a huge machine
beneath the head is a crude drawing of a body and the words im with stupid
an arrow points to zaphods head which is shouting
you should quit while youre a head zaphod
no one has ever got passed the magrathean defence system alive
humma laughs maniacally
zaphod held aloft on ford and arthurs shoulders staggers down the street toward the spaceport where the heart of gold is parked
his neck is wrapped with a blood soaked bandage which looks like a scarlet ascot
are we sure this is the right way
i dont know
yes thank you for clearing that up
ford looks puzzled at arthur
did i clear it up
a crowd has gathered
when they see zaphod they scream
zaphod over here
i want to have your baby
zaphod still feeling the effects of whatever drugs he was given dons a presidential smile and waves
back to the ship
they quicken their pace when suddenly
fifty vogon police emerge from the mist
we are here for your protection
zaphod ford trillian and arthur freeze in their tracks
hhgg rd revised draft kwaltz and questular watch the action on the front screen
fire upon the kidnapper
main street cont the police fire
f t a run for it but z stays put
well if thats what they want he pulls out his gun up and fires back
lets do lunch
nice haircut fella
your kids are the same age as mine we should get them together some time
with each line he fires
ford grabs him
shots hit a stack of aerosol cans
more mist rises
vogon headquarters cont commander
the president is the kidnapper
cont behind the kiosk cont the gang run down an alley and hide behind a kiosk
zaphod sports a goofy smile
arthur is scared to death
oh god i really hate thursdays
zaphod what do we do
build bridges between the stars
he holds up two peace signs a la nixon
i think that was his campaign slogan
trillian finds a deodorant can grabs it gets an idea
alright follow me
she aims the can at zaphods ear arthurs face registers the madness of the moment
hhgg rd revised draft cont int
bridge continuous cont there they are
cont on screen trillian with aerosol can to zaphods ear cont moves down the street
the crowd gasps
the quartet continues anxiously forward eyeing the police whose guns track their every move
back off or ill kill him i swear i will
cont kwaltz looks confused
cont could that actually kill him
cont the police step backwards but the crowd takes a step cont forward
a huddle of female admirers rush them waving pens and paper as if the beatles have arrived
zaphod paints on a smile breaks away from the others to go sign a few autographs
i totally voted for you
reveal that the female fans are actually a multi headed two legged groupie
cont on questular and kwaltz cont get her
the walrusy vogon police swarm in like maggots cont surrounding trillian and edging ford and arthur away
resistance is useless
shots are fired
the crowd screams and scatters
arthur reaches for trillian but she is engulfed by vogons who move en masse and pull her away into the mist
ford with zaphod in tow shoves arthur forward using his towel to clear a path through the mist
they see the heart of gold ramp descending from the belly of the ship
hhgg rd revised draft cont continued cont shots fire all around them as ford pushes zaphod and arthur up the ramp
vogon headquarters night cont questular and kwaltz watch the monitor as vogon police usher trillian in futuristic hand cuffs past the vogon captain who stands in the foreground on his
bring her to vogsphere for processing captain
the captain nods
the screen goes black
theyre coming here
but theyve only accomplished half the mission
what about zaphod
he must face justice
my instructions were clear
from a slot in his chair he pulls his instructions signed in triplicate of course
apprehend the kidnapper rescue the president
we do them in that order
and until the kidnapper is properly processed she isnt officially apprehended now is she mr
questular pulls out another small clump of hair
ford and arthur drag zaphod into the bridge
on the front screen they can see the vogon ships flying away
we have to go
still loopy right
looking strangely happy he slides the pink coordinate cube humma gave him into a slot on the console
take us to magrathea
follow those ships
hhgg rd revised draft arthur lunges for a control
zaphod woozily tries to stop him
theres a struggle then zaphod realizes
hey my third arm
i had one didnt i
we have to go after her
the computer fires to life bleeps and blips
only now it has an effete effeminate almost matriarchal voice
not so rough
youre damaging my joystick
they all look at the source of the voice confused
who is that
ghastly isnt it
i was asked to change the personality type this was the emergency back up
how if you want me to take you somewhere were going to have to start using our magic words please and thank you
can you change it back
i can but i wont enjoy it
im wait ing
arthur sees the vogon ships getting away
desperate he shoves zaphod out of the drivers seat
zaphod hits the floor considers protesting lies down on the floor to sleep instead with a contented smile
he looks very out of place in a seat normally reserved for the likes of han solo
he scans the console
ford sits in the seat beside him
dont look at me
im too depressed
hhgg rd revised draft getting desperate computer
isnt there some kind of manual override switch thing
show me the override switch or ill reprogram you with a very large axe
long pause i can see this relationship is something were all going to have to work at
a chime sounds
a switch on the console a illuminates
arthur flips the switch
the cockpit is sealed in a glass ball and shoots upwards
the cockpit bubble pops out like an ejector seat now a little glass pod
it floats through space then rear thrusters ignite and blast the ship forward
an aircraft steering wheel rises up between arthurs legs
he grabs it spinning out of control
i think i should push this button
ford pushes a big button
an alarm sounds
a sign lit up saying please do not push this button again
arthur grabs the control does his best to steer
the glass pod streaks unsteadily forward toward a dull the rectangular ship sits on the surface as police escort trillian off it and into a gray rectangular bldg
hhgg rd revised draft the ground is barren
a scintillatingly jeweled crab crawls out of a swamp and looks up at the sky
we hear the sound of the pod approaching but hold on the crab as eeeoooo ka kfffzzz
the crab runs back into the swamp
pan left to see the pod rammed into the ground steam rising
the door opens
the three emerge
dreadful isnt it
sorry about the landing
where are we
this is the vogon planet
this is vogsphere
i know it
ford reaches in his satchel pulls out a sort of electronic beret pulls it snugly onto zaphods head
little something i learned about on an altairian star cruiser
captains use them when they really need to concentrate
what is it
a thinking cap
zaphod squints hard to think as he looks around
there are rows and rows of dull gray rectangular buildings as far as the eye can see
cont the three men step out of the ship
cont this will all end in tears i just know it
marvin moves out a few paces behind
i checked the guide for ways to rescue a prisoner from vogsphere
it said dont
im assuming your plan is better
hhgg rd revised draft well i sort of had this idea we could
a telescopic rod with a paddle at the top shoots out of the ground smacks arthur on the face then retracts
arthur is stunned
none of the others have noticed
did anyone see that
they look at arthur
it suddenly seems ridiculous
they all walk along arthur at the back perplexed
what was it
just my imagination
another paddle springs up double smack in the face
arthur leaps back
nothing at all
everyone stop and watch me
i think we
a paddle springs up and smacks fords face
he leaps back clutching his cheeks
arthur spins around
what was that
arthur lifts his feet very carefully
he stops himself and looks round
hhgg rd revised draft what do you think zaphod
zaphod pulls his thinking cap down thinks hard
i think we should keep going
a paddle shoots up smacks zaphods face
they all saw
what the blazes is that
very deliberately i have
a paddle shoots up
he grabs its telescopic stalk
it thrashes in his hands
he breaks it
okay dont think of anything
dont have ideas or theories nothing
they all strain to think of nothing
several paddles shoot up
i cant help it
trillian is in there somewhere and we need an idea to save her
i have an idea
ever the politician
they take off running
a forest of paddle stalks erupts out of the ground around them smacking violently
they come to rest at the side of a vogon building
thinking not thinking not thinking no ideas coming
looking to marvin this is by no means an idea that has any merit but marvin can you give me a hand
the dullest office environment ever
a counter with few vogons behind it mindlessly moving bits of paper around
hhgg rd revised draft n continued n the front doors burst open
arthur storms through them holding marvins arm which has the fingers pointed like a gun
he trips falls drops the arm picks it up again trying hard to look tough
ford and zaphod follow zaphod wearing the thinking cap and sunglasses for disguise
ford wearing his towel over his face like a bandit
the vogons look up nonplussed
alright where is she
the director of robot arm repair
next building out the door to the left
arthur looks at the arm then slowly lowers it
actually were looking for
how to put this
someone youre detaining perhaps in some form of incarceration
prisoner release department
six buildings down out the door right left then two rights
big gray building cant miss it
trillian is seated beside a desk while a vogon officer asks her questions
kwaltz and questular stand nearby
he types into his ancient looking computer
try tricia mcmillan
tricia yggarstuk mcmillanus of blaard
tricia imogene mcmillan of earth
the officer types checks his screen shakes his head
no record of earth
hhgg rd revised draft earth
in the milky way
galactic sector zz plural z alpha
the vogon officer types reads from the screen
here it is
do you have a second home planet
push in on trillian gutted by the news
no thats impossible
says here it was destroyed to make way for a hyperspace expressway
the order was given
three weeks ago
he said the gray building right
all the buildings are gray
arthur sees vogon police escorting someone in handcuffs into one of the buildings
he raises marvins arm pointing the fingers
a f z enter the double doors then stop short
a typical government pick a number and wait sort of room
its packed with all manner of species
leave this to me
with gusto i know how to queue
he confidently takes a number and gets in line with the several hundred others feeling very much at home
hhgg rd revised draft cont int
prisoner processing bldg
interrogation room cont trillian sits at the officers desk arms folded defiant
i dont believe you
this is some sort of trick
zaphod wouldnt blow up a planet especially mine
kwaltz now steps forward and extends a piece of paper
these are the orders
trillian takes the paper runs her finger down to the signature line where it reads love and kisses zaphod
love and kisses
she hands the paper back swallowing emotion
now according to section sub section dash a the punishment for kidnapping is a recitation of the classic poem ode to the removal of your left kidney
unless said kidnapping is of the president in which case you are to be fed to the ravenous bugblatter beast of traal
we thank you for your cooperation
a door is opened revealing a room with a large steel box
a huge angry eye stares out of a tiny barred window
the box shakes like crazy
prisoner processing building main room continuous cont zaphod is in line with arthur and ford
he looks up to a presidential photograph of himself in suit and tie smiling broadly
he lowers his thinking cap
arthur steps up followed by ford and zaphod who keeps his head low and bowed
were here about getting a prisoner released
prisoner release form
she holds out her hand
arthur doesnt have a form
annoyed she points across the room to a wall that is nothing but shelves holding forms
hhgg rd revised draft cont continued cont right
once ive filled it out can i return to the front of the line seeing as ive already waited
arthur sighs frustrated
all three of them walk to the shelves holding the forms
arthur turns to zaphod
cant you do something
youre president arent you
you want me to make a speech shake a hand
thats what i do i think
its all a little fuzzy
arthur angrily fills out the form
arthur is back in line having waited a long time
he finally gets to the window hands the green form to the vogon processor
she types into her computer then checks the screen
this prisoner is being detained for
reading kidnapping the president
not eligible for release at this time
you can make an appointment for a later date or take a number and wait
arthurs breathing quickens
he cant take this
yanks thinking cap and sunglasses off zaphod this is the president
she looks at zaphod then back to the large portrait of zaphod then back to zaphod
he says the whole kidnapping thing was a terrible misunderstanding she didnt mean anything by it and hes ordering you to let her go
holding up green form but this isnt a presidential release of prisoner form
those are blue
she points to the wall of forms
hhgg rd revised draft cont quick cut back to trillian cont trillian is lowered into the bugblatter beast box cage
we cannot see the beast but its screams of hunger are scaring the hell out of trillian
cont back to arthur cont who returns practically shoving zaphod forward
zaphod hands the vogon processor the blue form
she reviews the form stamps it pulls off the carbon copy underneath hands that to zaphod
go to the prisoner release lobby out the door right left nd door on the right
cont back with trillian cont as she braces herself to be eaten by the monster
suddenly a couple of vogon guards enter and hand kwaltz a blue piece of paper
he reviews it then signs it
youre free to go
the vogon guard pulls trillian up and out of the box on a cable
the bugblatter beast goes berserk
yanking blue paper away reading hes here
zaphod is here
lets go get him
but the guard is already escorting trillian out of the room
kwaltz is completing paperwork
kwaltz holds up a walrusy hand one finger raised silencing questular while he continues
we hear the bugblatter beast weeping as the doors are closed on him
a guard escorts trillian into the lobby where f a z await
arthur steps toward her but zaphod steps in front of him smiling arms outstretched
trillian walks up to zaphod and slaps him
hhgg rd revised draft you bastard
you signed the order to destroy earth
love and kisses zaphod
i saw the form
you didnt even read it did you
honey im president of the galaxy
i dont get a lot of time for reading
an entire planet zaphod
all because you thought someone wanted your autograph
she slaps him again storms away bursting out the door
they framed me
its routine for controlling presidents
kwaltz finishes his paperwork stacks it neatly holds it up for questular to see
cancellation of the rescue of the president
he hands it to a messenger who runs off
another one runs up
with menace get me the apprehension of the president form
trillian storms away from the building enraged
she sees a one armed marvin standing by the glass pod
she heads for him
arthur catches up to her
why didnt you tell me
hhgg rd revised draft i tried
he threatened me
get a backbone arthur
she storms ahead of him
what about coming here to rescue you
that was my brilliant idea
a paddle shoots up and slaps him in the face
prisoner processing bldg
moments later cont kwaltz and questular flanked by the vogon police force step out of the building just in time to see
the glass heart of gold pod soaring overhead
they all watch as it disappears from sight
the president tests my patience
this time i shall pursue him myself
ready my ship
this is more like it
kwaltz sits in a desk filling out a form
questular holds two clumps of hair in each fist
my license is expired mr
i cant fly with an expired license its against the law
questular fists tremble
out comes two large tufts of hair
the pod is reattached to the heart of gold which soars through the stars
theyre all getting buckled into their seats
hhgg rd revised draft back to his normal voice hi fellas
hold on to your hats
the ship suddenly blasts forward
their heads are slammed back into the seats as they vibrate violently
arthur looks to the console and sees the two mice sliding across it getting thrown across the ship
they continue to vibrate even more violently
zaphod is all smiles hanging on as if he were on a rollercoaster ride
is but a blur as it streaks along
stars appear on the screen as they slow from hyperspace
guys im just super happy to tell you were approaching hyperspace exit gamma arthur steadies himself turns to trillian whos still staring forward angry
she unbuckles her seat belt and moves away from the console
a planet appears on screen
zaphod and ford lean forward
okay thats it
where are we headed again
hang on fella and ill check
hhgg rd revised draft arthur turns look over at
trillian who stares out a portal window into the emptiness of space
a tear rolls down her cheek
arthur steps up isnt sure what to say
look youre right
you deserved to know and i shouldve told you
i dont blame you if youre angry
she turns and stares wipes the tears away
guys it just tickles me pink to tell you we are currently in orbit at an altitude of three hundred miles around the legendary planet of magrathea
hearing this news arthur trillian and ford turn
tasting it take us in
night deep space magrathea a they all stare in awe as they move toward a planet which gets closer and closer
suddenly their faces are awash with light
two suns rise behind the planet
the twin suns of soulianis and rahm
marvin both arms in tact rises in the back peers out
b suddenly a ghostly white swirl of light vaguely in the b shape of a man appears on the screen before them
this is a recorded announcement as were all out the moment
the commercial council of magrathea thanks you for your esteemed visit but regrets that the entire planet is temporarily closed for business
if you would like to leave your name and a planet where you can be contacted kindly do so at the tone
then stunned silence
hhgg rd revised draft b continued b closed
how can a planet be closed
for once aldus i agree with you
take us down
the ship eases forward
the image appears again
it is most gratifying that your enthusiasm for our planet continues unabated
as a token of our appreciation we hope you will enjoy the two thermonuclear missiles weve just sent to converge with your craft
to ensure on going quality of service your death may be monitored for training purposes
the image vanishes
guys im delighted to tell you there are two thermonuclear missiles headed right for us
should i take evasive action
c the screens show two huge rockets thundering at us c zaphod just smiles
ford steps up
an illuminated dome lowers from the ceiling over the crew seats creating a safety pod
the heart of gold streaks away
two large missiles follow and mimic the h
s every move
the crew are thrown from one side of the pod to the other
there seems to be something jamming my guidance systems
impact minus seconds
call me eddie if itll help you relax
sky over magrathea continuous cont the h
the missiles are gaining
hhgg rd revised draft cont continued cont sure thing fellah
handing over manual control
big swell of muzak
the ship drops like a stone
the missiles miss then turn in a screeching curve
the safety pod cont zaphod tries to wrestle with three controls
i cant do this without my other arm
cont the h
spirals wildly missiles narrowly missing
cont cont in the safety pod everyone is thrown
cont cont in the sky the missiles are dead ahead shooting cont straight for us
cont in the safety pod cont did we lose them
theyre right behind us
he looks down sees the improbability drive button
look why dont i just hit this thing
no telling where it will send us
cont in the sky cont the missiles turn and accelerate high into the sky
a second set of boosters kick in on the missiles as they soar back toward the h
much much faster
cont on the bridge cont they all stare at the approaching missiles
arthur looks at the drive button
he flips open the glass lid
arthur hits the button
light blasts through the bridge
empty for a moment
then the heart of gold reforms
a few beats later a sperm whale floats into frame followed by a bowl of petunias
hhgg rd revised draft it coalesces back into shape out of chaos
the safety dome rises revealing our heroes standing in the exact same place they were dazed
where are we
exactly where we were i think
and the missiles
have apparently turned into a bowl of petunias and a very surprised looking whale
he points to the screen
the whale and petunias float by
at an improbability factor of eight million seven hundred and sixty seven thousand one hundred and twenty eight to one against
they all look to arthur who shrugs
zaphod nods his approval
ford counts on his fingers are they even
he waves it off gives arthur a little salute and moves on
trillian looks to arthur and musters a smile
i could really use a cup of tea
the whale in mid air stops rising starts falling
it is important to note that suddenly and against all probability a sperm whale had been called into existence several miles above the surface of an alien planet
and since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale this innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity as a whale before
it then had to come to terms with suddenly not being a whale any more
this is what it thought as it fell
the camera moves around the whale as it falls
hhgg rd revised draft ahhhh
who am i
why am i here
whats my purpose in life
what do i mean by who am i
what is this i that i want to know what it is
calm down get a grip now
this is an interesting sensation
angle from below
the whale is wriggling a bit
this is an interesting sensation what is it
its a sort of
yawning tingling sensation in
well i suppose id better start finding names for things if i want to make any headway in what for the sake of what i shall call an argument i
shall call the world so lets call it my stomach
its getting quite strong now
and hey whats this whistling roaring sound going past what im suddenly going to call my head
perhaps i can call that
is that a good name
perhaps i can give it a better name later when ive found out what its for
it must be very important because there certainly seems to be an awful lot of it
whats this thing
lets call it a tail yeah
the whale thrashes its tail
between the camera and the whale drops the bowl of petunias
it falls from sight
i can really thrash it about pretty good cant i
doesnt seem to achieve much but ill probably find out what its for later on
have i built up a coherent picture of things yet
hey this is really exciting so much to find out about ao much to look forward to im quite dizzy with anticipation
or is it the wind
there really is an awful lot of that now isnt there
its eye tries to look down
camera pulls back from the whale abandoning it
whats this thing coming suddenly coming towards me very fast so big and flat and round it needs a big wide sounding name like
thats it ground
i wonder if itll be friends with me
we hear a sickening thud o
hhgg rd revised draft curiously the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was oh no not again
we hear the petunia vase shattering
many have speculated that if we knew why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the universe than we do
the gang stand by a huge crater the h
parked in the b
a large whale carcass sits in the middle of it along with a few petunias
they all grimace
beyond the crater they see a formation of large rocks aligned in a circle
its the only structure in sight
they walk toward it
arthur walks behind the others his head down
this looks familiar
arthur looks up registers surprise
the rock formation looks like stonehenge only newer
the rocks letters carved into them that read design must be portal doors
you mean the hippies were right
in the middle of the circle sits a stone receptionist desk with a sign on it that says out to lunch
zaphod heads for the to design department stone
trillian and ford follow
zaphod feels around it looking for a switch a knob anything
he mustve hit something because the front of the stone suddenly slides open revealing a swirling okay
in we go
hhgg rd revised draft what
are you out of whats left of your mind
we cant step into that
we gotta pick one right
if its not the right one we come back and pick another
yes big biggie
what if thats the last door we ever step through
what if it rips us into tiny little atomic particle
trillian who hasnt said a word since leaving vogsphere covers her ears trying to block them out its the right one
i have a hunch
hes got good hunches
i say we go
go with the hunch of a narcissist with half a brain whos wearing a ridiculous thinking cap
are you insane
hey i think i resent that
i dont care what you think you think
they all start arguing over each other
we focus on trillian anger and frustration building she covers her ears then screams
and she takes off running for the door
they turn just in time to see her jump into the vortex
she yelps as her body is bent in half twisted like a rung mop then sucked inside
arthur is horrified literally gasping for air
ford is semi impressed
thats supposed to happen
ford shrugs throws his towel around his neck like a scarf and dives through
hhgg rd revised draft hey wait for me
he runs after ford stops at the door turns like hes about to board air force one gives a salute jumps in
arthur finally gets his legs to move steps up but hesitates at the threshold paralyzed with fear unable to take a step
then ffssssh the door seals shut
he bangs on the stone slides his hand around like zaphod did desperately looking for a way to open it
he collapses and buries his head in his hands
i told you this would all end in tears
ford stands outside a stone doorway at the end of a cobblestone street
zaphods body falls to the ground next to him untwists unbends and snaps bolt upright beside them
trillian is already heading down the street toward the temple
ford and zaphod hurry to catch up to her
arthur sits with his back against the stone staring across the field at the beautiful double sunset
he looks over and sees the two mice from the ship scurrying toward one of the giant stone doors
they slip through a crack beneath the stone
a flash of light bursts through the crack
arthur barely reacts so drained of emotion
life is full of paradoxes isnt it
dont talk to me about life
here i am god knows how far from home
dont talk to me about god
and this is where i see the most spectacular sunset ive ever laid eyes on
we only had the one sun at home
planet called earth
hhgg rd revised draft i know
you keep going on about it
it sounds awful
oh no its beautiful
or at least it was
did it have oceans
great wide rolling blue oceans
cant bear oceans
arthur looks up at marvin
so this is how it will all end then
me on a dead planet with a manically depressed robot
you think youve got problems
what are you supposed to do if you are a manically depressed robot
no dont bother to answer that im fifty thousand times more intelligent than you and even i dont know the answer
it gives me a headache just trying to think down to your level
arthur spins to see an old bearded man in long robes
he jumps crab walks backwards away from the man
who are you
my name is not important
arthur continues to scramble away from the man
you must come with me
terrible events are afoot
you must come or youll be late
what is your name earthman
hhgg rd revised draft dent
late as in the late dentarthurdent
its a sort of threat you see
never been much good at them myself but im told they can be terribly effective
he motions to the stone that is marked to showroom
your friends are safe
you can trust me
trust a man who wont tell me his name
heaves a sigh reluctant my name is
arthur reacts with a furrowed brow
i said it wasnt important
slartibartfast motions to the door
he looks to marvin
i could calculate your chances of survival but you wont like it
arthur rises cautiously moves over to slartis side
i must warn you
we are about to pass through well a sort of gateway thing
it may disturb you
it scares the willies out of me
he puts his hand on a certain spot in the stone and presses
the stone dissolves revealing once again the jet engine swirling vortex
slarti motions after you
arthur takes a deep breath and steps in
he is bent twisted and sucked away
marvin stands for a moment then looks up to
a the sky a where the fleet of vogon ships has now arrived
funny how just when you think life cant possibly get any worse it suddenly does
hhgg rd revised draft kwaltz sits in his chair as they press forward
the ghostly image of the recorded message appears
this is a recorded announcement as were all out at the moment
the commercial council of magrathea thanks you for
turn that off
arthur is hunched over a litter bin barfing
i told you you might find it a bit disturbing
i have found this whole day a bit disturbing
arthur realizes he has his towel with him
he wipes his mouth with it dabs his brow
then he notices
the room which is like a car dealers showroom only instead of cars there are models of various planets
did you know we built planets
arthur didnt know that
he looks perplexed
doing the coastlines was always my favorite
used to have endless fun doing all the little fiddly bits round fjords
but the galactic economy collapsed and seeing that custom built planets are something of a luxury commodity
getting back on subject at any rate theres been a terrible mix up with your planet
you must come with me or its all going to blow up in our faces
the best laid plans of mice you know
the best laid plans of mice and men
hhgg rd revised draft i dont think men have got much to do with it
arthur looks confused
slarti motions him to a door
arthur readies his towel at his mouth as slarti hits a button
the door slides open and nothing happens
its just a door that leads to a room where several transport carts move past like a kids ride at disneyland
they step into one
slarti closes the little door
the cart moves through a curtain out into deep space
pull back till the cart is no more than a speck being pushed forward by the longest telescoping arm in history
the space is millions of miles across
floating in it are half finished planets construction gantries around them
welcome to our factory floor
on arthur who is positively blown away
ford zaphod and trillian enter the dimly lit temple
they hear a faint tinny sound
they follow it
the sound gets louder
flickering light illuminates the end of the corridor
this is it
he quickens his pace
trillian and ford follow
they round the corner to find
deep thought sitting there majestically
the tinny music emanates from somewhere near him
zaphod takes another step in and now sees the source of the tinny music
deep thought is watching tv
a violent stupid cartoon
this is a good bit
the cartoon continues
zaphod enters removes his thinking cap and reverently approaches
hhgg rd revised draft oh great deep thought
we have traveled long
have you calculated
the ultimate question
of life the universe and everything
ive been watching tv
zaphod holds a smile but his world is slowly crumbling
i designed another computer to perform that great task
looking around is it here
its on another world
it is another world
ask your companion
zaphod turns to ford
ford looks confused
zaphod looks to trillian
she looks equally confused
zaphod puts the thinking cap back on
kay youre sure you dont have the question
or a way to you you know access it or something
i think ive done like a lot to get here
hhgg rd revised draft shhhhhh
zaphod looks up
deep thought is shushing him
the shows back on
a robotic arm reaches out and turns up the volume
zaphod stands turns to ford and trillian smiles that smile but its starting to look a bit crazed
this is just great
lets go find something else for my entire life to be about
he starts to march off
ford grabs his arm
the one humma sent us for
we have to get it
you gave the guy your head
why did i do that
he pulls his thinking cap down all the way over his eyes
ford rolls his eyes turns
we were told you have a g
before he finishes the sentence a panel in the wall slides open revealing a large scary looking gun
a robotic arm pushes it forward
ford goes over takes it carries it like its nitroglycerin to zaphod whos already walking away ford hands zaphod the gun
i dont do guns
zaphod takes it with a smile
and instantly points it at his head
ford lunges for it
theres a struggle
fords trying to get zaphods finger off the trigger when click
the trigger is pulled
but apparently nothing has happened
this is a bust too
hhgg rd revised draft hey man you must be really frustrated
to go through all you did only to come here and get no answer which means no fame and money and you deserve that man
because youre great youre just really really great
zaphod isnt sure what just happened
but he smiles anyway
trillian however is onto something
give me that thing
the transport cart moves past two half finished planets and on toward a rd planet
construction gantries and clouds obscure our view
the galaxy was a bit of a shambles you see
everyone enjoying themselves being singers and comedians and really creative and interesting things like that
no one doing the boring jobs
oh you had that problem too
so a species was genetically engineered to do the boring jobs
tax inspectors traffic wardens government officials
we were commissioned to build a special planet for them
problem was some cleverdick made it so any time one of the creatures had an interesting idea it would get a hefty smack around the face
you did that
ive been there
the cart lowers down toward the surface of the planet
then i gather youve met some of the inhabitants
shuddering relentless blighters
hhgg rd revised draft a ext
magrathea day a two missiles screech overhead and soar up toward
the vogon ships descending from space
the missiles each hit a ship
two more missiles fire taking out two more ships
but several ships do land
marvin watches from within the stonehenge formation
loathe it or ignore it you cant like it
and youre right i shouldnt be so upset cause life goes on and i should just go on with it right
pull back to reveal ford is hesitantly aiming the gun at zaphod
shoot him again
ford reluctantly pulls the trigger
hitchhiking is good
towels are good too
i kinda like this
she take the gun from him
a gun that makes people suddenly see things from your point of view
useful tool for the deranged evangelist trying to convert the masses eh
she starts walking
we should get back
spinning on him pointed i do especially since were both somewhat of an endangered species now
hhgg rd revised draft why so edgy
she cant believe hes asking this
she aims the gun of course youre edgy your planets been blown up and youve been tooling around the galaxy with the guy who signed the order click
she shoots him again
you actually wanted to know the question because you always thought there was more to life and now youre crushed because you find out there really isnt
shes getting angrier and more hurt
youve got no home no family no one to be with and youre stuck with me another in a long line of men who doesnt appreciate you because hes too
busy appreciating himself
hearing this puts a lump in her throat causes her eyes to well with tears
she lowers the gun
zaphod shakes his head the effect wearing off
but he realizes what he said and doesnt like it
give me that thing
he grabs the gun points it at her
wont affect me
im already a woman
before he can react a bright light shines behind them
they turn shielding their eyes
uh oh oh
its okay its only a couple of
they are engulfed in white light
the transport cart continues toward the rd planet
here we are then
arthur turns and looks
there before him is
hhgg rd revised draft o a earth arthur is thunderstruck
a so it wasnt destroyed
actually it was
this is a back up
earth mark ii
so youre saying you
made the earth
well not me alone
it was a group effort
i did my part though
ever heard of a place i think its called norway
b arthur nods
the cart pushes through the clouds towards b ayers rock
a guy on a ladder is painting it its familiar red color
some of it is still primer grey
that was one of mine
won an award you know
lovely crinkly edges
i was sorry to hear about it being blown up
shocking cock up
the mice were furious
who cares about bloody mice
are you a fan of plate tectonics
arthur looks up
slartibartfast points down
c another man pushes a button causing mountains to spring c up noisily
arthur is working very hard to process all this
d jump cut
they move through a forest where a man presses d a lever making several mushrooms pop up on the ground
earthman you must realize that the planet you lived on was commissioned paid for and run by mice
it was destroyed shortly before the completion of the purpose for which it was built
ten minutes later we would have been free and clear
but we gave them our standard ten million year warranty and they have come here to retrieve this back up copy
and theyve brought you with them
the transport cart flies out of forest toward the ocean
hhgg rd revised draft d continued d they brought
im sorry when you say mice do you mean the little white furry creatures with the cheese fixation
these creatures you call mice are merely the protrusion into our dimension of hyper intelligent pan dimensional beings
the whole business with the cheese mustve been a front
they were experimenting on you you see
a vast computer program
i see where youre confused
you see we were experimenting on them
e over the ocean a perfect storm wave rolls toward them
e oh i gather they arranged for you to conduct some primitively staged experiments so they could prod your thinking here and there
but you were actually elements in the computer program
they really are very clever hyper intelligent pan dimensional beings
looking down ah
theyve nearly finished the oceans
f they move toward the white cliffs of dover
a man stands f on a cliff holding a giant hose water spewing from it
so youre trying to tell me that mice designed and built deep thought
and deep thought designed the earth
which was a giant supercomputer
that you built
to calculate the ultimate question
only vogons destroyed it ten minutes before the program was completed
thats bureaucracy for you
actually this explains a lot
all my life ive had this strange feeling that something was going on in the world something big something sinister
thats just perfectly normal paranoia
everyone in the universe has that
a s swoop down and soar over the english countryside partially constructed tall tree stocks with branch and leaves lying beside them waiting to be attached
men rolling out sod like a giant carpet etc
hhgg rd revised draft i dont know perhaps im old and tired but i always think that the chances of finding out whats really going on are so absurdly remote
that the only thing to do is say hang the sense of it and keep yourself busy
id much rather be happy than right any day
and are you
thats where it all falls down of course
slowing the platform here we are then
l the platform slows to a stop
arthur steps out and is stunned to see
its partially constructed
the chimney lies intact on the ground waiting to be hoisted up
a row of hedges lies on its side beside a trench
but its his house alright
arthur in a daze stumbles toward the house
arthur dents house mark continuous a arthur enters his house
there is no furniture no photographs or books or any evidence of his existence there
he feels the walls the countertops
arthur pokes his head around a wall to find
ford zaphod and trillian sitting at an elegantly set table stuffing their faces with a meal fit for a king
arthur dents house mark a what what are you doing
what happened to you
they talk while continuing to stuff food in their mouths
chew chew our hosts attacked us with dismodulating anti phase stun mist chew chew then brought us to this amazing meal as a way to make it up to us
try the mutton
hhgg rd revised draft a continued a mouth full zarking incredible
they cant seem to stop eating like theyve been drugged
hosts attack you
and then you sit down for is that tea
arthur has spotted a tea pot on the table
he hurries to it feels it
he pours a cup takes a sip closes his eyes enjoying it
now thats a cup of tea
were glad you like it earth creature
he looks down and sees the two white mice sitting on a silver platter
after ten million years on earth and a rather large chunk of that time in england it would be utterly humiliating if we didnt know how to make a decent
pot of tea
arthur stares in shock
arthur these are our hosts
benjy mouse and franky mouse chew chew
they control a large sector of the universe in our dimension chew chew
im sorry i thought you were told about the mice
yes i was
i just wasnt quite prepared for the full reality of it
he steadies himself on the table
benjy pushes his hand through the air the chair at the end slides backward
in a moment perhaps
i cant seem to let go of this table
slartibartfast steps forward
hhgg rd revised draft a continued a pardon the interruption but ill just be getting back to work now
that wont be necessary slartibartfast
cracking up like hes stoned smarty fart blast
it looks like we wont be needing the new earth after all now that weve found the only living native of the planet
theyve nearly finished the oceans
that will be all slartibartfast
slarti slightly hurt backs away out of sight
im sorry when you say the only living native do you mean me
what about her
benjy holds up a strand of hairs same color as trillians
we performed some rudimentary dna tests on the ship
shes half native
her real father was a blahardid the hyper intelligent yet carelessly nomadic race native to the planet olbed who apparently popped in to earth for a one nighter with a
looking up mouth full which explains a lot
she goes back to eating
arthur is taking this all in
so mostly harmless and me
were sorry to have stage managed you so shamelessly but once we learned you were the only full blooded earthling in the universe it was important that we get you
here by any means necessary
hhgg rd revised draft a continued a weve spent a considerable amount of time on your planet trying to find this wretched ultimate question and the thought of doing it
all over again on account of those idiotic vogons sickens me to no end
which is why youre here
arthur goes to pull out the chair beside him
the others look up
benjy and franky cover their outburst with a smile
this chair is much more comfortable
benjy makes a motion
the chair he pushed out before slides over behind arthurs knees making him sit
he slides the cup of tea over
arthur takes a sip
this really is delicious
glad you like it
now to business
ford and zaphod raise their glasses like drunken sailors
benjy and franky fire them a look
thought you were proposing a toast
ford and zaphod eat
benjy turns to arthur
no one notices through the window a row of vogons cresting the hill
about this ultimate question
you see weve been offered a quite enormously fat contract to do the d tv chat show and lecture circuit and quite frankly were very much inclined to take it
hhgg rd revised draft a continued a but and heres the point we have to have product
which means we still need an ultimate question
or at least one that sounds ultimate
got to sound good
an ultimate question that sounds good
from a couple of mice
for a chat show
and as it turns out the chances are astronomically high that the structure of the question is encoded in your brain
which is why we need it
franky tries to pour more tea
arthur stops drinking a little woozy
did he hear them right
im sorry did you just say you need my brain
to extract the question
you cant have my brain
im using it
we can replace it if you think its important
an electronic brain maybe
a simple one should suffice
who would know the difference
no you wouldnt
we could program you not to
arthur tries to get up
clamps spring up from the chair and wrap around his arms
a dome flips over from the back and slams down on his head
hhgg rd revised draft a continued a theyre gorging on the food half lidded out of it
what are they whats in the food
the platter the mice are standing on rises up moves toward arthur ominous surgical instruments spring from it
you wont feel a thing
the mice on the platter move ominously toward arthur
arthur still attached to the chair backs away
scythes and rotating arms with circular saw blades shoot out ominous surgical equipment to remove his brain
wait a minute just wait a sodding the scythes and arms stop spinning
arthur stumbles backwards and sits down in the chair
the others stop eating and listen
you want the question that goes with the answer how about whats six times seven
or how many vogons does it take to screw in a lightbulb
or heres one how many roads must a man walk down
hey thats not bad
through the opposite window in much the same way bulldozers arrived in the opening we see more vogons arriving
theres plenty more where that came from because my head is filled with questions and i can assure you mate no answer to any of them has ever brought me
one iota of happiness
he shakes his head
we dont want to be happy
we want to be rich
take his brain
hhgg rd revised draft a continued a benjy steers the platter toward arthur
he jerks his arms up
they break free of the shackles and hit the platter
the mice fly through the air and land on the table right beside the pov gun
they scramble to their feet
they try to lift the pov gun but its way too heavy
arthur his butt still strapped in the chair leaps over to the table and grabs the first thing he sees a leg of mutton
he raises it high
benjy and franky look up
arthur brings the mutton down squashing them flat
the others instantly snap out of their food induced haze zaphod suddenly clutches his gut
ohhhh i think im gonna be sick
arthur looks up and now he sees the vogons marching down the hill toward the house
he leans over the table bumping his teacup
it shatters to the ground
an army of vogon police march over it
marvin marches as well a gun held to his head
to the vogon i must warn you im feeling very depressed
we are here for your protection
zaphod appears at the front door and waves presidentially
the police open fire
zaphod and the others flee as the barrage of fire continues
trillian drops the pov gun goes back for it
arthur stops her and pulls her behind the truck
marvin catches a bullet in the back of his head sparks fly and he is thrown forwards
is he dead
ford looks at marvin lying face down in the dirt his head emitting smoke
hhgg rd revised draft okay that thing i said about not saving my life because were even
save at will
we need that gun
campaign sound byte we need tighter gun control
we need his other head
an idea okay ill create a distraction
he holds up his towel
sarcastic brilliant plan
im certain it will work
squinting at arthur you know i think sometimes you say things that mean something other than what youre actually saying
more gunfire erupts
ford spins his towel until its twisted and taught
he leaps up and runs towards
the vogon police force who see him coming his towel held like hes going to whip someone on the ass
the vogons are so caught off guard they back away
she and arthur both run out toward the gun
i thought i was
what are i thought i was
ill get you
fine they each grab the gun just as questular realizes
its a towel
its only a towel
get the police stop their retreat raise their guns move forward
ford skids to a stop and runs back toward arthur and trillian both clinging to the gun running back toward the truck
a and t trip
the pov gun goes flying and lands in
hhgg rd revised draft the vogon police run in formation toward the gang
ford looks back sees the vogons approaching
he looks forward sees marvin raising the gun
he looks to the skies just as ford fans out his towel and uses it to bring z a t to the ground just as
the entire vogon police force is hit
they instantly stop
their shoulders slump
in unison oh whats the point
they turn their weapons on themselves and
angle on ford zaphod arthur and trillian turning their heads as we hear the weapons fire
they look up
a all the vogon police lie motionless on the ground a including kwaltz
questular is the last man standing
he marches toward them patches of clump baldness on his head
he drops to his knees
zaphod takes the gun fires it at questular
he rises and paints on a big smile
what am i so pissed off about
im zarking incredible
everyone loves me
look at me
questular runs towards a lake blow hole takes off his clothes and jumps in
you saved our lives
wretched isnt it
distant oh man
i love being me
they share a laugh
arthur approaches slartibartfast
hhgg rd revised draft a continued a ive just been informed by some of the lads that since were so near completion were going to go ahead and finish earth
we can put it back exactly the way it was when you left you know unless theres anything youd like to change
something you think your planet could do without
arthur thinks about it
he looks to trillian who raises an eyebrow
lets go somewhere
yes you name it
im going to hummas
he has my head
im so confused
and im hungry
after we get your head lets grab a bite
i know this great restaurant at the end of the universe
as they walk away we cut to
slartis factory elevator where they all board
everyone grabs the rail except for trillian who holds on to arthur
up into the sky they go
stand by for commencement of life cycle
all systems checked and cleared
we hear kl klunk
and watch nature burst into life animals run flowers bloom waterfalls cascade mountains rise in the mist monkeys bathe in hot springs etc
set to a wonderful uplifting piece of music what a wonderful world
tilt up to the sky
the day turns to night
the heart of gold streaks through the stars
