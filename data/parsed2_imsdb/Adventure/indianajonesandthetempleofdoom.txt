a chinese gong sounds and the glittering doors of an art deco pa poda slide open to reveal a mammoth silver stairway down which rows of beautiful women start descending
begin main titles the lovely ladies are a mix of races and they sing a strange haunting melody one might think them a heavenly choir if it werent for their sexy clinging lame gowns
from the ethereal beauties we cut to a street urchins dirty face short round is a ten year old chinese kis wearing a beat up american baseball cap
sneaking into the club short round weaves past the fancy gowns and silk suits heading toward the music in the main ballroom
short round enters and stares across the smoky nightclub
on the stage he sees a giant paper mache dragon laying curled around the pagoda
now the dragons eyes light up its nostrils exhale smoke and its enormous jaws open
out of the dragons mouth walks the star of the stage show willie scott a dreamy beauty singing a sultry solo white the or chestra wails the accompaniment
but short rounds not here to ogle crooning dames
he surveys the rich chinese american and european revelers
jewels flash and champagne flows
short round finally spots a table of somber looking chinese men in suits
short round chews gum and stares at the men
then he turns to go
wu han a waiter with a scar across his cheek watches short round leave
as short round hurries toward the exit he bumps into a man in a tuxedo entering the club
short round looks up at the man but we dont see his face
then short round is grabbed by the scruff of his neck and a door man hustles him out the door short round yelling insults all the way
a maitre d apologizes to the man in the tuxedo and two hat check girls smile at him familiarly as he continues into the ballroom
we notice something incongruous the man in the tuxedo is wear ing work boots caked with mud
the man in the tuxedo stops to watch willie scott singing sexily on the stage
then he looks around and sees the table of somber chinese men that short round spotted earlier
as the man in the tuxedo walks toward the table he removes a cigarette from a silver case
he arrives at the table just as the chorus and orchestra reach a crescendo and on the stage a glistening muscular slave swings a huge ham mer toward an enormous
brass gong the man in the tuxedo leans to receive a light from a cigarette girl and as the gong booms the match flares to reveal his face for the first time its indiana jones
elegant in a tuxedo dressed to kill
the titles end and over this a legend appears on the screen at the table the four chinese man in suits stare coldly at indi ana
nee chin lie how ma
laos men laugh and assume that indy doesnt understand his joke
wah hung how nee nah
wah hwey hung jing chee jah loo nee kao soo wah shu shu
lao she looks angry and his mens smiles fade
you never told me you spoke my language dr
i dont like to show off
indiana takes a seat across the table from shanghais notorious crime lord
lao is fifty wealthy enough to now display some fat but still muscular from his fight to the top of the garbage heap
for this special occasion i ordered champagne and caviar
indiana looks at the pile of caviar on the plate in front of him and stubs his cigarette out in it
the cigarette sizzles and laos smiles dies with it
theres applause as wille scott finishes her song
at the table lao stares at indiana with a strange intensity
so it is true dr
you found nurhachi
sure i found him
then last night i had a little trouble
somebody tried to slit my throat
indiana looks across the table at laos son chen who resembles a bulldog and snarls like one now
indiana contd it was dark but i think one of your sons tried to get nurhachi without paying for him
indy stares pointedly at chens recently bandaged hand
chen mutters and stands angrily lao barks a command in chinese and chen sits down again
you have insulted my son
next time ill cut off more than his finger
jones i want nurhachi
lao pulls a wad of cash out of his pocket and puts it on the table
indiana glances at it
as i recall the deal was consid erably more
now a pretty hand slips onto laos shoulder and he looks up to see willie scott
lao kisses her hand
willie is unaware of the explosive mood at the table and she smiles flirtaciously at indi ana
to lao arent you going to introduce us
this is willie scott
watching indy and this is indiana jones the famous archaeologist
willie sits down between lao and indy
she takes out a small mirror to check her make up
lao contd dr
jones found nurhachi for me and is about to deliver him now
lao nods across the table and indy sees kao kan laos second son open his coat and remove a silver plated pistol
indiana looks worried
willie doesnt notice as she fixes her make up and coyly teases indiana
well i thought archaeologists were always funny little men searching for their mummies yelping aaahhh
she looks down terrified at the knife indy is poking against her ribs
wille contd i was only kidding cant you take a joke
to lao lao hes got a knife
put the gun away sonny
kao kan glances at his father
lao finally nods to his son and he slips the pistol back into his pocket
now i suggest you pay me what you promised or your girlfriend here is going to be squealing a new tune
the ritzy patrons at the tables nearby are unaware of the tawdry drama quietly unfolding at this table
willie eyes the blade and whimpers
she looks imploringly at lao and he slowly reaches into his pocket
he puts ten gold coins next to the cash on the table
indy leans forward to look at the gold coins so intently that he fails to notice kao kan spilling some powder into indys cham pagne glass
try again lao the deal was more
the knife pokes willie and she whimpers again
lao reaches into another pocket and brings out a folded piece of rice paper he opens it and a large diamond and ruby spill out onto the table
indiana contd bingo
you see lao with a but of persuasion even you can be an honest fellow
indy smiles and jabs the knife into the middle of the table
then he lifts his champagne glass in a toast to lao who watches expectantly as indiana moves the glass toward his lips suddenly willie stands angrily jostling indys arm so
that he doesnt drink his champagne
look at this
he put a hole in my dress from paris
lao sees indy put his champagne glass down and he snarls at wil lie sit down
willie quickly obeys
lao forces a smile at indy and lifts his glass to seal the deal lao contd to your health dr
lao sips hs champagne and watches hopefully as indy picks up his glass and this time indy does drink the champagne
then he reaches for the cash but chen grins and puts a silver snuff bottle next to the cash gold and jewels he tips the little bottle over and some
white powder spills out of it whats that
a bonus dr
that is poison
you just drank the rest of it
indiana examines his champagne glass and sees a residue at the bottom of it
he swallows and feels sick wondering it its fear or the poison already taking effect
lao contd there is an antidote for this poison
you give me nurhachi i give you the antidote
indiana is sweating
willie looks at him and sees indys hand shaking
lao contd the poison works fast dr
where is nurhachi
indiana finally reaches into his pocket
next to the cash gold jewels and poison indiana sets down a beautiful small box
lao and his men stare hypnotically at the exquisite gold and enamel box
nervously this nurhachis a very small guy
nobody pays any attention to her as lao reaches for the box
inside are the remains of nur hachi the first emperor of the manchu dynasty
lao opens the box carefully and stares reverently at the grey powder inside
indiana contd now what about the antidote lao
holding the box at last i have the ashes of my sacred ancestor
so whats the big deal
let me see it qillie grabs laos arm and some of the precious ashes spill out of the gold box
stunned by this desecration of his ancestor lao grabs willie by the wrist and twists her arm you fool
ow youre hurting me you miser able little hood
let go of her lao
and give me the antidote
lao just laughs evilly until a waiter moves up behind lao and the crimelord suddenly stiffens
he lets go of willies wrist and raises his hands off the table
chen stops collecting the money and jewels
kao kan tenses and indy smiles at wu han the chinese waiter with the scar who is standing behind lao
wu han has a towel over his hand under it he has a pistol pressed against laos spine
indiana contd smiling at wu han i like the service here
puzzled hey hes not a waiter
no wu hans an old friend i brought along
to lao so the games not over
put the antidote on the table lao
lao carefully reaches into his pocket and puts a small glass vial of liquid next to the cash gold jewels poison and sacred box
indy looks relieved as he reaches for the vial of antidote then he hears a muffled report
wu han groans and sways
indy starts to stand but chen immedi ately turns the smoking pistol with the silencer that he used to kill wu han indy sees it pointed at him now and
he remains in his seat
kao kan stands and grabs wu han easing the phoney waiter into the chair he just vacated
the muffled shooting hasnt attracted any attention
the nightclub activity continues an indy speaks emotionally to his dying friend
wu han listen to me im going to get you out of here
in pain wu han looks at indy and struggles to speak not this time my friend
smiling bravely i followed you on many adventures but into the great unknown mystery i go first indy
wu han dies and slumps forward
indiana is shattered by the death of his old friend
dont be sad dr
jones you will soon join him
indys gaze shifts from his dead friend to laos sneering face
then indy sees the murderous chen giggling perversely
indys anger is compounded by the poison burning in his gut and his vis ion of chens ugly face blurs into a double image indy stands up unsteadily
chen assumes hes about to keel over from the poison but indy suddenly turns and grabs a real wai ter at another table
the waiter holds a long skewer of roasted pigeons that hes just set afire indy grabs the skewer of pigeons flambee and hurls is across the table
chen fires and misses and screams as the skewer stabs into his chest and the burning pigeons flame in front of his hor rified face
this the other tables definitely notice
there are screams and all hell breaks loose
indiana shoves past willie and reaches for the vial on the table the antidote
but hes grabbed from behind by kao kan
indy elbows the punk reaches back and grabs his head and somersaults kao kan onto the table
as nubmer two son crashes into the table the impact sends the emperor nurhachis ashes billowing into laos stricken face
indiana yells as he sees the vial of antidote rolling across the table and falling
indiana dives and catches the antidote just before it hits the floor then indys hand is brutally stomped on by one of laos henchmen and the vial rolls away
indiana angrily raises his head smashing it up into the hench mans groin the man howls like a banshee and hobbles away
meanwhile willie watches lao grabbing for cash from the table
willie lunges past the pigeon skewered chen to snatch the jewels but unfortunately kao kan knocks them off the table as he leaps to attack indy
indiana scrambles on his hands and knees after the rolling vial
people keep kicking it he almost has it when willie runs into him trips and lands on her back
look out damn it i need that antidote
wheres that diamond
gunfire explodes and they both scramble in different directions
indy dives through the fleeing nightclub patrons and slides be hind a water spewing fountain
water kicks up as indy is shot at by lao and his henchmen
indy sees the vial of antidote kicked again and it spins across the marble floor feeling the poison indy shakes his head groddily and splashes water on his face
meanwhile willie is chasing her diamond shoving through the panicked crowd
she spots the diamond
another elegantly dresses soman is bending to pick it up acidly polite excuse me but i believe thats my diamond
willie smiles and suddenly kicks the woman in the butt
willie reaches to get the diamond but not before the other woman tackles her
behind the fountain indiana makes a break he runs and dives on top of a serving cart
the wheeled cart hurtles toward an un suspecting gunman crashes into him from behind and sends him flying head first into a row of ice buckets
nearby willie slugs the other lady in the jaw and grabs for the elusive diamond just as the ice buckets showers ice across the floor which camouflages the diamond
searching desperately for the jewel willie sees the vial of antidote spinning across the floor as it slides by she grabs it
she sees indy speeding by atop the serving cart
lao and his gunmen rush out to block the way
indy rolls off the cart and slides behind a potted palm as laos men open fire again
indiana contd shouting to willie hey dont go away
i need that
willie smiles meanly as she slips the vial down the front of her dress thumbs her nose at indiana and walks away
indiana contd if i wasnt dying id kill her
hiding behind the palm tree indiana looks around and spots a gi ant statue at the side of the stage
indy makes a break for it
as the gunmen open fire indy springs onto a chair jumps onto a table and leaps onto the stage
he grabs the golden broad sword from the chinese warrior statue
as bullets smash into the statue indiana hides behind it
then he jumps out and swings the large sword toward the enormous brass gong
the crimson cord holding the gong is slashed
indy slings the sword at his assailants and gives the three meter high gong a helpful shove the giant gong rolls and echoes as it crashes down the marble steps
indiana ducks behind it as it gains momentum and rolls across the dance floor
using the gong as an enormous shield indy evades the gunfire ex ploding bullets ricochet off the rolling brass gong as indy runs behind it
ahead willie hurries toward an exit she hears something and turns her eyes go wide as she sees the mammoth gong bearing down on her
willie yells as indiana grabs her arm and pulls her behind the gong with him lao watches amazed as he and his gunmen dodge tables trying to get better firing
positions and more henchmen come into the club now and start firing machine guns
as bullets clang against the gong indiana and willie run behind it
willie hollers as they head directly for a towering floor to ceiling window
indiana grabs willie around the waist and after the huge gong crashes through the stained glass window they both fly after it
in a shower of sparkling glass the enormous gong sails out and crashes down a sloping green tiled roof
indiana jones and wil lie scott hurtle into the night air after it
the gong rolls down the roof and they hit the tiles behind it indiana holding onto willie as they roll one over the other toward the edge willie screams as
they fall into thin air
their entwined bodies plummet three stories ripping through a third floor awning crashing through an old mans mattress on a second floor balcony finally they smash through the convertible top
of a parked duesen berg and fall into the back seat
willie sits up wide eyed speechless and amazed to be alive
then she sees an equally astonished short round looking at them from the front seat
step on it short round
okey doke indy
hold onto your potatoes
the twelve year old chinese kid turns his baseball cap bill backwards and steps on the gas
the tires squeal as the car roars off for crying out loud a kids driv ing the car
relax ive been giving him lessons
the duesenberg races past the entrace to the nightclub as lao and his man rush out and jump into two black sedans
the sedans screech off in pursuit of the duesenberg
as short round eagerly swerves around a corner willie holds on for dear life
indiana suddenly puts his hand down the front of willies dress listen we just met for crissake
im not that kind of gril
dont get your hopes up wheres the antidote
indiana withdraws his hand having finally found the vial
he opens is quickly tips the vial to his lips and grimaces as he swallows the stuff
you dont look very good
poison never agrees with me
shouting forward pull a right short round and head for the wang poo bridge
as the car accelerates indy peers out the back window at their pursuers
willie notices her reflection in the side window look at what youve done to me
im a mess
my lipsticks smeared i broke two nails ive got an aw ful run in my stocking
gunfire suddenly explodes bullets whizz through the canvas top and the rear window shatters and sprays glass
willie ducks and cringes terrified in the corner somehow i think youve got bigger problems
indy grabs his shoulder bag and pulls a pistol out of it
he pokes the gun through the broken window and starts firing back at their pursuers then he turns and looks ahead
indiana contd there shorty
through the tunnel
through the windows we see the car racing into a tunnel
lights from the pursuing cars flash through the rear window and gunfire echoes in the tunnel
whatre we going to do
wherere we going
no look out short round
indy reaches over the front seat and helps short round navigate
the duesenberg tears around the square followed by laos two se dans
people on the street dive for cover coolies pulling rickshaws go into hyper jov lanterns spanning the street crash down and are dragged behind the duesenberg
bullets exlode and amazed prostitutes watch the cars zoom past
the chaotic chase continues bullets whine past and the shred ded convertible top whips in the wind
shouting you got the tickets short round
sure indy three tickets
you me and wu han shorty throws an envelope back and indy looks at the three tickets
sadly wu hans not coming shorty
unaware of what happened at the club short round thinks a mo ment
dont worry indy
short round number one bodyguard now
willie reaches for the extra ticket
ill take the extra ticket
grabbing it from indy wheres this plane going anyway
but im not dressed for siam
leaving behind the squalid port the duesenberg flies along the highway through the trees
in a moment laos two sedans race by
the duesenberg swings around a curve and skids through gravel to ward the airfield
in the distance there is a small terminal but short round wheels the car toward the cargo area a two engine passenger plane is revving its motors and the last
passengers are boarding
the duesenberg squeals to a stop and indy jumps out with willie and short round right on his heels
a contingent of airport military police move to bar their way until weber a heavy set englishman runs up pufffing and shout ing
no no theyre all right
let them through please
jones this is positively the last time our airline can hold a plane for you
now you must hurry
while short round grabs a small bag out of the car weber and a stewardess take their tickets and rush them all toward the air plane
meanwhile the two sedans skid to a stop and lao and his son kao kan jumpsout with their henchmen
the puzzled military police advance on them usspiciously realizing hes outnumbered lao instructs his men to stay back and to put away their weapons
willie and short round charge up the ladder and onto the plane
indy pauses at the top of the steps to give lao a cocky farewell salute
indy boards the plane and the co pilot slams the door
the plane starts taxiing
by the cars lao is buffeted by the prop wash as he angrily watches the plane roll away
behind lao his son kao kan stares at the plane taking off a look on kao kans face indicates that he hasnt given up yet
the plane lifts off the airfield silhouetted against the clouds and the first light of dawn
the sun flashes above the horizon and the plane banks through white billowing clouds at it heads west
a door opens at the rear of the plane and indiana jones exits wearing more familiar attire a beat up leather jacket over a khaki shirt and a snap brim
he passes a dozen passengers as he moves up the aisle carrying his rolled up tuzedo
in the first row willie is busy fixing her make up
shorty sits in the seat across the aisle from her
indy comes up and drops his tuxedo onto the floor
willie sees him hook his coiled bullwhip over a coat peg
so whatre you supposed to be a lion tamer
since i was nice enough to let you tag along why dont you give your mouth a rest
indy pats her leg she removes his hand and reaches down and picks up his tuxedo coat
she slips it on
what do you mean tag along
from the minute you walked into that nightclub you havent been able to keep your eyes off me
he smiles and tips his hat down over his eyes to go to sleep
at the same moment the chinese co pilot tips his hat up off his eyes and looks scared to death
he exclaims in chinese co pilot subtitled good lord
he and the pilot see two biplanes materialize out of the clouds and dive directly toward them
suddenly machine gunfire erupts
pilot subtitled dive for the clouds
the dc banks into the clouds as the two biplanes attack
in the back seat of the first biplane we see kao kan watching the dc like a hawk about to bring down a sparrow
the biplanes swoop past both sides of the plane and bursts of gunfire rip along the fuselage
co pilot subtitled they hit a fuel line
pilot subtitled reduce speed get everyone out of the plane
as the air battle rages the passengers are tossed about and some start screaming
short round peers out a window
lao send planes to kill indy
willie shakes indys arm but he continues snoring under his hat
its the drug he drank to stop the poison the cockpit door bursts open and the chinese co pilot exits to make an announcement he smiles and speaks in chinese
then he smiles and speaks in french willie looks lost until the chinese co pilot smiles again and speaks in english please to remain calm
we start passing out parachutes now the co pilot hurries toward the rear
willie looks petrified as a stewardess rushes up and hands her a parachute
you got to be kidding
no i cant
the pilot hurries out of the cockpit and grabs his parachute as he heads toward the back
willie contd wait whos flying the plane
she opens the door to the cockpit willie contd nobodys flying the plane
the dc smokes through the clouds
passengers are bailing out parachutes billowing
as one of the fighters swoops through the parachutes kao kan searches the faces then he points at the dc
into the radio jones
the two planes roar off and start strafing the dc again
the co pilot has a parachute on and is trying to get short round into one
put it on
whats wrong with you
youve got to jump
no cant leave indy
short round suddenly butts the co pilot in the stomach with his head
the co pilot yells and falls out the door
short round sees the co pilots parachute billow
then willie rushes up
give me that parachute i changed my mind she grabs the parachute and starts to fight shorty over it no this last one
its for indy
they scuffle until the parachute skids across the floor
short round jumps for it the parachute falls out the door and short round starts to fall out after it
willie grabs him by the seat of his pants and hauls him back from the abyss
the fighters peel off toward the dc with their guns flaming in another attack
short round tries to wake indy again
finally shorty grabs indys bag pulls his holster out of it and runs toward the back
indy continues to sleep until bullets smash the window by his head and a fire extinguisher is hit and starts spraying into indys face
he finally awakens and jumps up
he looks around is disbelief at the battle torn nearly empty airplane
groggily we there yet
indiana sees shorty shooting his pistol out the side door as the planes swoop by again
out of ammo shorty throws the gun angrily at the passing plane
indiana picks up his whip and attaches it to his belt as willie runs over to him
theres nobody flying the plane
the door flies open and indy rushes in with willie behind him
indy appraises the situation quickly and jumps into the pilots seat with total confidence willie contd you know how to fly
indy surveys the control panels the myraid of dials and switches no
hopefully do you
willie runs screaming out of the cockpit her last hope shatter ed
shorty is pulling something out of the cargo compartment hes found a machine gun and sets it up on a short tripod
come here lady hold this and shut up please
he pulls willie down to the floor and shoves her the ammunition belt thats draped toward the gun
then shorty jumps behind the machine gun as the first fighter appears off their side short round blasts out the open door
the machine gun explodes to life chewing bullets smoking and spitting shells at willie willie hollers terrified by manages to feed the ammo belt as short round sights the blazing
machine gun suddenly he shoops
willie sees the fighter hit it smokes and veers away and then explodes
i get it
you got it
the second plane swoops down and short round blasts away
this time as he swivels the gun he misses and hits one of the dc s own engines and it explodes
oh oh big mistake
trying to figure out the controls indy looks up to see their en gine explose into flames angrily short round what in the hell are you doing
suddenly the dc emerges out of a cloud and indy sees they are headed directly for a mountain
he pulls back hard on the con trols as a rocky peak looms lethally in front of them
the dc lifts at the last second and smashes some snow off the uppermost pinnacle as it clears the mountain by inches
kao kans fighter is glued to the dc s tail and continues to strafe but the fighter pilot pulls up too late and the fighter explodes as it hits the
peak of the mountain
indy rushes out of the smoking cockpit to find willie and short round crawling out from under the debris thats fallen on them
then indy spots something in the wreckage he pulls at some yellow canvas and willie sees as sign emergency life raft
indy drags the folded canvas over to the open door
are you crazy a lift raft
were not sinking were crashing
get over here damn it
short round come on grab onto me tight
willie sees short round rush over to indiana and grab him around the waist from behind
willie finally jumps up and runs over wait for me
she throws her arms around indys neck so that she and shorty are both hugging him from behind
indy clutches the folded lift raft in front of him and surveys the mountainside rushing close be neath the skinking airplane finally an instant before the plane will hit indy
dives and pulls the inflation cord
as the smoking dc screams out of control toward the mountain skimming the rocky snow covered slopes we see the lift raft spilling out the open door the raft pops
into its full shape acting now as a spoiler soar ing against the rushing wind and finally crashing and bouncing against the snowy mountainside
in the distance we see the dc finally kiss the earth and ex plode in a cloud of flame against a rocky escarpment metal and earth mushrooming in a million
as the raft rockets down the snow indiana clutches the front and willie and short round hold on for dear life on either side of him
the raft plummets down the mountain crossing the timber line and entering a forest
bouncing over a snow hidden log the raft shoots directly for a tree indiana pulls on the perimeter rope rolls on his side and man ages to swerve the raft
so it caroms offthe snow drifted side of the tree trunk
continuing its downhill run the raft smashes across a small steam sending silvery water spraying
as the raft skids below the snow level it starts bouncing over rocky ground and its three passengers teeth start chattering
the yellow raft crashes through a tangle of bushes and then plum mets toward a bluff
the raft goes airborne over a small bluff and lands with a splash in a slow moving river
the life raft drifts down the river and indy looks around and smiles cockily at willie and short round their faces dont show gratitude but horror indy hears some thing
and turns to see the raft is heading directly toward a surging stretch of treach erous rapids
indiana looks less cocky as he and willie and short round hold on again for dear life
the raft plunges into the roaring torrent bouncing over rock swollen waves twisting and spinning through narrow gaps
the three helpless passengers are drenched in the thundering cascades of white water
willie is hallering short round hangs on wide eyed and even indy looks terrified as the raft crashes down the rapids
finally after one heart stopping bounce the raft seems to slow
the raft drifts out of the main part of the river and glides to ward a clearing
its three soaked and bedraggled passengers lie motionless in the bottom
indys hand drags alongside the raft his fingers leaving a trail in the almost still water
battered and exhausted but always indys bodyguard shorty looks over at him worriedly indy
indy looks over at willie who is moaning
indiana contd you all right
im not cut out for the kind of life you lead
moaning oh no
i ripped my dress
where are we anyway
the raft floats to a gentle stop we see it nudge against a pair of dark feet
indy squints up into the sun and sees some thing
holy cow india
how do you know were in she rolls over and yelps as she looks up at the bizarre painted face of a shaman
silhoutted against the blazing sun the skin ny little old man in a loincoloth stares down at them in the raft
an eerie wind rises and howls
the old man places his palms to gether and moves his hands up to touch his forehead
willie and short round watch mystified as indiana returns the old shamans silent greeting
indya and short round follow the shaman and four peasants down a gutted path through barren rolling hills
willie is out of her milieu stumbling along this forlorn landscape in high heels tuxedo jacket and disheveled lame gown
she hears the old shaman talking to indy and catches up with them to find out whats going on
to indiana whatd he say
he told me they knew i was coming here
what do you mean how
the old man saw it in a dream
dream nightmare is more like it
he said thats whey they were at river they were waiting for the plane to fall down
he looks at her bewildered face and smiles faintly
as they walk a hot wind swirls dust around them a wind slowly ravaging what soil is left in this terribly blighted region
at the base of the hills mayapore village does nothing to re lieve the awful sense of devastation
a desolate road runs through the village along which groups of ptiifully poor vil lagers stare at the strangers being brought in
hopeless women lift buckets from a dry well finding only sand
skinny miserable dogs skulk between the decrepit village huts eyed by the patient vultures lurling in scraggly trees
indiana notices the wretched peasants staring at short round some of them pointing at him a few haggard women shedding tears down their wrinkled faces as the little chinese boy
there is no sign of children in the village and short round grows frightened by the odd attention
he moves closer to indy as they pass the devastated population
black clouds clot across the blood red sky as darkness falls
indiana willie and short round sit tensely on a shabby rug
above their heads there is a thatched roof but there are no walls
the dying sunset silhouettes them and the half dozen elders seat ed in the dirt around them
a grey haired man the village chieftain gives quiet commands to the women who scuttle in and set wooden plates in front of the three visitors
no plates are places in front of the elders
quietly to indy i hope this means were going to get some dinner
indiana sees the painted shaman who sits next to the chieftain watching willie
the women bring in a bowl from which they scoop tiny portions of grey gruel onto three plates
to this the women add a few grains of yellowed rice and a with ered molding piece of fruit
willie looks aghast at the unappe tizing combination
quietly god i am starving but i cant eat this
thats more food than these people eat in a week
pointedly theyre starving too
willie looks around at the emaciated faces and feels like crawl ing into a hole
im sorry i here please
she picks up her plate and gently hands it back to the women
the chieftain finally speaks to them you will rest here before you go on
wed appreciate that
this was an unexpected detour
well have to go to delhi now and find a flight west
smiling indy is taking me to america
all eyes are on short round
puzzled by this strange attention shortys smile fades nervously
im a professor
i have to re turn to the university
can you give us a guide to take us to delhi
the chieftain indicates a young villager sitting near them
sanju will guide you
the old shaman speaks now for the first time
on the way to delhi you will stop at pankot
puzzled pankot isnt on the way to delhi
you will go to palace there
hasnt the pankot palace been de serted since the mutiny of
now there is new maharajah and palace is powerful again
the shaman looks around at his unfortunate people
shaman contd it is pankot palace that kills my village
i dont understand
whats hap pened here
the evil starts in pankot
then like monsoon it moves darkness over all country
they came from palace and took sivalinga from out village
willie looks over at indiana took what
its a sacred stone in a shine thats supposed to protect a village
it is why krishna brought you here
politely firm nobody brought us here
our plane crashed
we were shot down by interrupting no
we pray to krishna to help us find the stone
it was krishna who made you fall from sky so you can got to pankot palace
to find siva linga and bring back to us
indys about to object then he looks at the sad chieftain the elders and peasants who are watching him helplessly
and he sees again the dark steady eyes of the old shaman
torches falre eerily and dogs howl as the peasants accompany the shaman elders and three visitors out ot the edge of the dark village
short round walks beside indy
indy they make out plane crash
to get you here
its just superstition shorty
like a ghost story
short round looks plenty scared as they all stop walking
the shaman motions and the men with torches circle around a pile of rocks to illuminate them
the shaman makes a gesture of devotion to the primitive shrine and indy speaks to the village chieftain
indiana seems skeptical as he kneels to study the shrine
on top of the pile of rocks there is a carved niche
the niche is empty but an indentation indicates the conical shape of the stone that was stolen
was the stone very smooth
he sees the chieftain nod it was probably brought here from a sacred river
joining indy and the chieftain long ago before my fathers father
and it had three lines painted across it
seeing the shaman nod the lines represent the three levels of the universe
ive seen stones like the one you lost
indy stands slowly
willie is beside him looking at the shrine
i dont understand how losing one rock could destroy this village
whispering to indy is it really powerful
indy gives a doubtful smile
he turns again to the old shaman
but why would the maharajah take this sacred stone
they say we must pray to their evil god
we say we will not
the old shaman looks off and fights the tears in his eyes as he starts speaking in hindi
translating he says that when the sacred stone was taken the village wells dried up first and then the river stopped
indy turns and asks the shaman a question in hindi
the shaman answers in hindi
translating he says their crops dies and then the animals died
the shaman walks to the edge of the torchlight and looks out into the darkness as he continues speaking emotionally in hindi translating and then they took their children
she looks at short round and finally understands the sorrowful faces always watching him
indy asks another question in hindi and the shaman continues his story translating he says one night there was a fire in the fields
the men went to fight it
when they came back they heard the women crying in the darkness
and the children were gone
the shaman walks slowly toward indiana
you will find them when you find sivlalinga
im sorry i dont know how i can help you here
the shaman and the chieftain stare and indiana refusing to accept that
indiana contd the english authorities who con trol this area are the only ones who can help you
they do not listen
i have friends in delhi and i will make sure they investigate this
no you will got to pankot
the old man speaks again in his own tongue and indy looks dis turbed
whatd he say now
it was destined that i came here and the future cannot be changed
indy looks ath the shaman and the torchlight reflected in his eyes
suddenly were rushing headlong down a dark dirt path seen from the pov of somebody running in terror
we hear heavy breathing above we see the scraggly trees blowing against the full moon as an eerie wind rises and howls
we continue crashing through the dying fields tward the dark village
the wind swirls into the hut and indianas eyes open
he lies still a moment and then sits up slowly
he sees short round sleeping nearby
sensing something strange indy gets to his feet
he steps around short round and goes to the door of the hut
indy walks against the rising wind and looks around
the village is asleep and seems deserted
then he turns and sees something
we follow small bare feet stumbling through the dust
indy sees an emaciated child in rag running out of the darkness
indiana moves forward and the child runs toward him
indy grabs the little boy as he falls into his arms
a few minutes later the little boy is lying unconscious on a blanket
elders crouch around him
indy is kneeling and watches the shaman wet the boys forehead with a rag and drip water onto his lips
the little boys eyes open and he begins to revive
shrot round and willie watch from a corner as the little boy looks at all the faces peering down at him
the little boys arm moves and he reaches out to indy rather than any of the others
indy takes his small hand and sees that the boys fingers are cut and bruised his fingers open and drop something into indys hand
the little boy tries to whisper
indy has to lean close to hear as the little boys lips move again sankara
a mother rushes into the hut now and kneels and hugs her little boy
his skinny arms go around her as they are reunited
indy stands slowly and looks at what the little boy gave him it is a small tattered piece of cloth an old fragment of a mini ature painting
indiana looks at it with an expression of recog nition and apprehension
the camera follows indiana hes walking fast and determinded ly
villagers trot alongside of him trying to keep up with is pace as he questions thm in hindi
indy approaches two large elephants and sees their guide sajnu trying to politely drag willie toward one of them
damn it willie get on weve got to move out
willies head comes up over the back of the elephant as shes helped from below there is a look of sheer terror on her face
easy now nice elephant
waiting by the second elephant short round sees indy coming and runs up to him i ride with you indy
nope you got a little surprise over there shorty
short round runs around the big elephant and sees a baby elephant being brought out
he cant believe his luck oh boy
meanwhile sajnu goads willies elephant over
the villagers look grief stricken and many are crying as they watch the three stran gers departure
to short round this is the first time anybody ever cried when i left
they dont cry about you
they cry about the elephants leaving
they got no food to feed them
so they taking the elephants away to sell them
indy lumbers over on his elephant
all right lets go
i want to get to pankot before tomorrow night
she looks at indiana as he rides past
i thought we were going to delhi
hey wait a minute
looking at the villagers cant somebody take me to delhi
i dont want to go to pankot
sajnu guides her elephant and willie lurches forward willie contd yelling indiana
whyd you change your mind
what did that kid tell you last night
indy ignores her hollering
the elephants move off through the crowds of pitiful villagers
indy sees the elders chieftain and the old shaman who brings his hands up to his forehead as indy rides past
the elephants move across the desolate countryside toward the distant hills
indiana rides the lead elephant
sajnu passes on foot guiding willies elephant
with the tuxedo jacket wrapped around her waist willie is dabbing perfume behind her ears
to her elephant i think you need this more than me
willie leans forward and puts perfume behind the elephants ears
grimacing at the animals smell she simply dumps the rest of the perfume on the elephants back
willie yelps when the elephants trunk comes back sniffs the foriegn fragrance and suddenly trumpets in disgust
willie contd whatre you complaining about this is expensive stuff
from a cliff we see the elephants below passing into the lower jungles
spotting something on an overhanging tree branck short round stands up precariously on the baby elephants back
he pulls a vine from the tree as they pass under it
plopping down onto the baby elephants back he picks the wild fruit from the vine here you go lunch time
the baby elephants trunk comes back and takes the fruit
shorty looks up in the sky
short round contd indy look
indiana and willie look up and see hundreds of enormous winged creatures flapping across the afternoon sky
those are very big bird
sajnu says something and indiana nods
those arent birds those are giant bats
willie shudders as she watches the bats
an enormous sun silhouettes the three elephants trekking west ward
the three elephants stand sucking up river water with their trunks
seated on the huge beasts willie short round and indi ana watch the thirsty animals
they must be pretty dumb to drink that awful looking water
in response willies elephant calmly lifts its trunk and sprays her in the face
short round and indy laugh as willie sits soaked and shocked
i think maybe well camp here
a plume of water sprays
the three elephants submerge in a deep wide spot in the river
indy wades in the current with his shirt off
he and the guide splash water on the weary animals
short round laughs and plays with the baby elephant
wrapped in its trunk hes swung in the air and lands on the elephants back
shorty makes a swan dive back into the water and the baby elephant gives him a shower when he surfaces
thirty yards upstream birds and monkeys chatter in a tree
in the shady river beneath willie surfaces cooly and wipes hair from her eyes
she hums contendedly
indiana wanders up the riverbank in his dripping trousers
he notices willies wet clothes spread over a tree limb hanging low over the water and then he sees willie paddling around
hey willie i think you better get out now
if youre trying to seduce me dr
jones this is a very primitive approach
me seduce you
honey youre the one who took your clothes off
shrugging i just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water
somehow i feel safer in here
as indy turns and starts off willie reaches up to the tree branch above her head and grabs her underwear
at this moment we notice something awful a boa constrictor is moving out along the branch the enormous snake slithering over willies clothes
willie watches indiana walk away as she reaches up for her dress her hands feel something strange not the dress and not the tree limb willie looks up and sees
that shes pulling on a snake
she screams as the boa constrictor falls off the t ee on top of her
indy hears the scream and hears willie calling to him
he runs back toward the river
stopping on the riverbank he sees willie backing away in the water indianas already starting to pull his boots off indy
dont worry im coming in
what is it
suddenly indiana freezes and a strange look corsses his face a what
he finally sees the boa constrictor thrashing in the water close to willie
he leaves his boots on
willie contd hurry help me out of here
whatre you waiting for
uh listen willie i got a better idea
first of all dont panic
willie suddenly screams as the boa constrictor wraps around her arm its got me
indy help me
indy runs along the riverbank trying to get closer to her but not about to jump into the river due to his aversion to snakes see episode one raiders of
the lost ark
dont let it pull you deeper
its pulling me deeper
dont let it curl around you
its curling around me
damn it stop talking and do something
the snake is wrapping around her body and neck her head is barely above water on the riverbank indy reaches down and grabs a piece of wood
but as he watches the repulsive reptile he starts to sweat and his fear and loathing overpower him willie contd whats wrong
indy please help me
indy groans and bolsters his courage he takes two steps into the water but the complex is to strong and he cant go any further
he drops the piece of wood
do exactly what i tell you now
can you move your arm
just one arm
okay i want you to lift your hand and pet the snake
yes stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal verte brae
pet it on the head
go on pet it
in the water willie is whimpering as she lifts her hand and starts petting the snake coiling around her pale body
oh my god its going to crush me
keep stroking it
willie keeps rubbing her hand along the snakes head and back and it slowly stops thrashing in the water
indiana contd whats happening
its starting to let go
thats good youre doing fine
grimacing as she stares at the ugly serpents head willie keeps stroking it
its letting fo
i think its i think its going to sleep
indiana looks relieved
he sees the snake starting to drift away from willie and she starts paddling back to shore collecting her floating clothes along the way
holding her dripping dress against herself she walks out of the water toward indy who smiles at her weakly
see i got you out
she slows and hauls off and punches him in the mouth
indy holds his jaw as she walks away infuriates
thanks for nothing
i hate snakes
looking at the water i know the feeling
by firelight we see sajnu feeding the big elephants while short round feeds and talks to the baby elephant you come to america with me and we can get job
in the circus you like that
the baby elephant trumpets affirmitively
a ways off willie stands wrapped in a blanket watching shorty and the elephant as she dries her hair by a campfire
now indy comes up and drops an armload of wood for yet another fire
whered you find your little body guard
i met short round when he tried to pick my pocket
indiana kneels and arranges the wood
indiana contd shortys family was killed when they bombed shanghai
he was living on the streets
smiling hell be okay
hes a good kid
indy strikes a match and lights the new fire
willie contd all these fires you expecting more snakes dr
she smiles snidely and continues drying her hair
by the way howd you end up in shanghai
well when my nightclub career was run over by the depression some pinhead convinced me that a girl could go places in the orient
so look where i got
indy picks up a blanket and spreads it on the ground
what about the future
oh thats easy im going to latch onto a good looking in credibly rich prince
indy lies down on the blanket
id like to find one of those myself
raising an eyebrow oh really
yeah but hes got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years
smiling fortune and glory
is that what youre hoping to find at this palace dr
indy reaches into his pocket and removes the old piece of cloth
she walks over to where hes lying down and sits on a boulder
he hands her the cloth and she looks at it by the firelight
something that kid gave me last night
its a piece of an old manuscript
willie sees a crude drawing in reds blue and gold
indiana contd the drawing shows a priest named sankara who lived centuries ago
what does the writing say
it tells the story of sankara climbing mt
kalisa where he met the hindu god shiva
examining it thats shiva
whats he giving the priest
legend says he told sankara to go forth and combat evil
to do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers
looking at indy you mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village
indy looks at her meaningfully
it could be
willie seems frightened
she hands him the piece of cloth and stands up
quietly fortune and glory
sweet dreams dr
she picks up a blanket and starts off
i think you should sleep closer
seeing her sus picious look i meant for safety
smiling id be safer sleeping with that snake
she steps over to a tree by the fire where her clothes are dry ing
indy watches her pull her dried clothes from the lower branches
she reaches up to remove another piece of her clothing its stuck to the tree and she looks up and yanks it
suddenly the piece of clothing moves
two enormous winds open and the hideous face of a giant bat screeches and hisses at willie
she screams hysterically as the bat flaps against her biting and scratching at her before it fi nally takes off
the bat flies off into the darkness and indy chuckles as he watches willie shanking as she backs slowly toward the fire did you see it
it was one of those bats
staring into the darkness god what else is out there
she quickly picks up her blanket and lays it out very close to indy
couldnt keep away huh
just try and control yourself
indiana watches her lie down and wrap herself in her blanket
then he rolls over and tips his hat down over his eyes to get some well deserved shut eye
in a moment however we see something grotesque and snake like slide into frame and move towards indy finally we realize its an elephants trunk
the trunk nudges indys shoulder
without looking still scared
okay willie you can get closer if you want
the elephants trunk moves closer and nuzzles indys neck
honey i knew youd be the first one to give in
now we see that short round is guiding the baby elephants trunk with a prod
willie watches stifling a laugh as the elephants trunk sniffs indianas ear indiana contd youre going to start something im going to have to finish
moaning okay doll you asked for it
indiana rolls over lifts his hat and hollers
he nearly jumps out of his pants as he stares into the elephants trunk
willie and short round dissolve into laughter
tall vine covered trees sway in the wind
beneath them the el ephants plough through the dense tropical forest
the sounds of the teeming jungle multiply as short round surveys the distant hills
willie looks off at the resplendent while moghul style palace ri sing in the distance above the jungle
their mayapore guide walks toward the camera and suddenly looks frightened
he barks commands and the elephants stop
indiana jumps down an joins the fearful guide
they stare at a small statue of a malevolent goddess with eight arms
around the goddesss neck a carved necklace displays small human heads her eight hands hold other heads by their hair
indiana moves closer to the statue as the terrified guide backs away
indy is fascinated by the ritual objects adorning it leaves dead birds rodents and turtles
indiana grimaces as he lifts a necklace of real pierced human fingers
why are we stopping here
indiana goes back and joins the scared jabbering guide who is helping willie down from the elephant
short round jumps down
what you look at indy
just a statue
whats the guide talking about
he hasnt said a word the whole trip
indy listens to the agitated guide and then speaks a few words in hindi back to him
they watch the distressed guide trun the ele phants and start away with them as fast as possible
hes afraid of something
he said he couldnt take us any farther
he has to go sell the elephants
you mean we have to walk the rest of the way
willie moans and follows indy
short round watches the elephants trudging away
the little elephant turns and looks back
short round quickly wipes a tear from his face
indiana and short round hike up a rock paved road beside a high wall
exhausted carrying her high heels willie trudges along behind them
shot at fallen out of a plane nearly drowned squashed by a snake attacked by a bat i smell like an elephant
yelling i tell you im not going to make it
indiana finally stops
he walks back to willie suddenly picks her us in his arms and starts carrying her the remaining way
willie is surprised and puzzled
any more complaints
smiling faintly yeah i wish youd thought of this sooner
she doesnt seem to mind being carried by indy
he arrives at the entrance to the palace and puts her down she stands close to him and he gently smoothes the collar of her dress
it doesnt feel like theres been any permanent damage
she smiles at him again and then turns around and whistles as she sees pankot palace a sprawling monumental mixture of mo ghul and rajput styles the palace is an
extravaganza of princely architecture
the three travelers start across a marble bridge toward the main entrance
lined along the bridge palace guards stand with lances
as the threesome passes the first rajput guard snaps noisily to attention and willie jumps
as willie continues across the bridge the other guards snap to attention in sequence and she grins enjoying the attention
short round and willie follow indiana through a dark archway into a glittering courtyard
the palace seems deserted and forebod ing
indys voice echoes off the marble facades three enormous raj put guards with curved swords in their sashes appear silently at opposite sides of the courtyard
then a tall severe looking indian in an english suit material izes out of the shadows and comes forward slowly
chattar lal appraises the intruders suspiciously he sees a whoozy beauty in a weary evening gown a dirty chinese kid with a baseball cap a rugged looking american carrying a
i would say you look rather lost
disdainfullt but then i cannot imagine where in the world the three of you would look at home
smiling evenly lost
no were not lost
were on our way to delhi
this is miss scott and mr
my names indiana jones
the eminent archae ologist
hard to believe isnt it
i remember first hearing your name when i was studying at oxford
i am chattar lal prime minister for his highness the maharajah of pankot
he bows and willie sort of curtsies
chattar lal contd welcome to pankot palace
they walk along the marble halls past dazzling walls inlaid with pieces of mirror and semi precious stones
fountains spray in ivory countyards and they gaze in awe at the ornate splendour
as willie walks with shorty she appraises the chronolgoical portraits of the pankot prices that line the hall
dissipated faces elegant faces evil faces she reacts to them
to short round howd you like to run into him in a dark alley
that ones kind of cute
i could see myself married to a prince like that
ahead of them chattar lal walks with indy and questions him suspiciously the plane crash and your journey here sound most incredible
you should have been there
wed appreciate it if the mahara jah would let us stay tonight
well be on out way in the morn ing
i am only his humble servant but the maharajah usually listens to my advice
is that him
theyve come to the last in the row of princes portraits
wil lie stops and looks up disappointedly at a picture of an aged immensely corpulent rajput prince
willie contd politely hes not exactly what we call a spring chicken
no no that is uhmed singh the present maharajahs late father
and maybe the pres ent marahajah is a little younger
two female servants approach silently and bow
they will escort you to your rooms now
you will be provided with fresh clothes
tonight you will be dining with his highness
and with a prince
my luck is changing
but look at me my god ive to to get ready
she hurried off with one of the servants toward her room
chat tar lal smiles cooly at indiana eight oclock in the pleasure pavilion
an extraordinary gold dome rises in the middle of the eleaborate gardens
the pleasure pavilion is ablaze with torch lights flickering candles and exotic music
indiana comes out of the palace with short round
indy has on a tweed jacket and a nectie his university professors outfit
short round has been cleaned up but still sports his baseball cap
willie joins them looking stunning is a silk western styled gown
shes also been loaned some moghul jewelry which sparkles on her neck and arms
you look like a princess
willies flattered by the first nice thing indys said to her
its sort of like being in heaven
they cross the garden toward the pavilion and willies eyes are like a kids at christmas
as they enter indiana gives a half dressed dancing girl the once over as she spins to the music of drums and vinhas
smiling ive always had a weakness for folk dancing
snidely she might get away with that act here but shed never make it in a real nightclub
they walk among the rich court ministers and indian merchants
chattar lal approaches with a british cavalry captain in unifrom
we are fortunate tonight to have some many unexpected guests
his is captain phillip blumburtt
blumburtt bows to willie and indiana
chattar lal contd captain blumburtt and his troops are here to check up on the natives
politely just a routine inspection tour
the british worry so about their emprie it makes us feel like well cared for children
lal what do you call the maharajahs wife
his highness has not yet taken a wife
well i guess he just hasnt met the right woman
as willie chatters on with the prime minister indiana wanders off
he moves to a wall where bronze statues and strange devo tional objects are displayed
joining indy interested in local curios
but i am interested in the occult
and this is a krtya
indiana picks up a small clay figurine and examines it
its like the voodoo dolls of west africa
the kryta represents your enemy and gives you complete power over him
that god all that mumbo jumbo rubbish is disappearing
you think so
admittedly its taken time
britians controlled india for almost two hundred eyars now
indiana smiles at the somewhat pompous bureaucrat
youre hanging on better here than you did in america
smiling sourly this is a different situation dr
these people are like children
we have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century
indiana puts the doll down and looks over at chattar lal and willie
the prime minister doesnt seem that naive
no hes a very shrewd old boy
power behind the throne and all that
he actually runs this whole province
indy and the prime minister exchange distant looks as willie comes back over to indiana
she talks to him conspiratorially i think this maharajah is swim ming in money
maybe coming here wasnt such a bad idea
blumburtt finds these americans quite suspect and seems relieved when he hears a drum
i believe were being called to dinner
as the drum beats the assembled guests move toward a long low table surrounded by colorful pillows
short round follows with a little monkey hes found perched on his arm
as everyone stands around the table chattar lal makes an an nouncement in hindi and then in english his supremem highness guardian of rajput tradition the maharajah of pankot zalim
all eyes are on two solid silver doors which open and through which now walks the maharajah zalim singh
everyone is bowing including indiana and willie who looks amazed thats the maharajah that kid
maybe he likes older women
indeed zalim singh is only thirteen
outfitted in silver and gold brocade festooned with enormous jewels the litlle mahara jah gazes imperiously at the bowing crowd and then glares at short round
indy sees short round chewing gum staring antagonistically at the maharajah
indy pushes short round into a bowing position
the maharajah finally sits down on golden pillows
he nods and his guests take their seats
indiana sees willies dreams of queendom have vanished
cheer up you lost your prince but dinners on the way
ive never been so hungry in my life
servants appear with silver platters of steaming food
they place a platter in front of willie and she stares at it in amaze ment its a whole raosted boar replete with a decorative arrow pierc ing its bloated
stomach and tiny broiled baby bores placed around it as if they were suckling on their well cooked mother
grimacing my god sort of grusome isnt it
seeing the meat being served indiana looks across the table at blumburtt who seems equally puzzled
meanwhile the little maha rajah whispers to his prime minsiter
then chattar lal speaks to the table his highness wants me to welcome his visitors
especially the renowned dr
jones from america
indy bows slightly toward the maharajah
we are honored to be here
servants put down another platter
willie stares at an enormous steaming boa constrictor on the platter
with a flash of a knife a servant slits the huge snake and exposes a mass of squirming live baby eels inside
suddenly im not so hungry
meanwhile indiana is chatting poleitely with the prime minister
i had a question mr
prime mini ster
i was examining some of the maharajahs artifacts
a very fine collection of very old pieces dont you think
yes very fine
but not all of the pieces look old
some were carved recently and look like images used by the thuggees to worship the god des kali
at the emntion of the thuggees the indians at the table quiet as it a taboo has been broken
chattar lal glares at indiana
jones you know very well that the thuggee cult has been dead for nearly a century
the thuggees were an obscenity that worshipped kali with human sacrifices
the brit ish army wiped them out about the time of the mutiny of
short round avoids the dinner by feeding it to his little monkey as he listens to the scary conversation
the talk is bad enough but willie finds the food unbelievable
a servant leans overher shoulder and places a six inch long bug on her plate
willie whimpers quietly as she watches the fat merchant next to her lift one of the black shiny baked beetles and crack it in two
the man proceeds to enthusiastically suck the gooey innards out
looking at willie but youre not eating
weakly i uh had bugs for lunch
meanwhile indiana continues to politely needle chattar lal
i suppose stories of the thuggees die hard
there are no stories anymore
well i dont know
we came here from a small village and the peas ants there told us that the pankot palace was growing powerful again becuase of some ancient evil
indiana smiles and shrugs
sneeringly their stories are just fear and folklore
but how do you explain the thuggee shrine i saw right below the palace
indy catches a glance between the little maharajah and the prime minister who answers slowly the local peasants are just as superstitious
youre very ob servant dr
but youre beginning to worry capt
blumburtts phlegmatic attitude has changed to curiosity
im not worried prime minister just interested
during their conversation willie listens to beetles snapping and she watches revolted as the other dinner guests suck the gooey insides out of the bugs
to short round give me your hat
im going to puke in it
meanwhile indy continues ingenously with chattar lal
you know the villagers also claimed that this palace stole something from them
jones it our country a guest does not usually insult his host
sorry i thought we were just talking about folklore
trying to make peace im sure its nothing
just ru mors
but interested what was it they claimed was stolen
a sacred rock
condescendingly there you see captain
when they lost this rock their fields and animals dies
they also said their children were taken from them
i think thats enough of this nonsense dr
indiana smiles faintly at chattar lals anger
across the table willie looks pale and motions to the waiter
so you have something you know simple like soup or something
the servant goes off and returns with a covered bowl
he uncov ers it and willie looks at a soup with a dozen eyeballs floating in it
i wanna go home
willie whimpers and tears start down her cheeks
to chattar lal i was dubious muself at first
then something connected the villages rock and the old legend of the sankara stones
controlling himself dr
jones we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors
i seem to re member that in honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist
shrugging the newspapers exaggerated the incident and didnt the sultan of madagas car threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his coun try
that was a misunderstanding
smiling exactly what we have here dr
i have heard the terrible stories of the evil thuggee cult
when the little marahajah speaks it surprises everyone and there is silence
maharajah contd i thought the stories were told to frighten children
later i learned that the thuggee cult was once real and did unspeakable things
the marahajah looks at indiana
maharajah contd i am ashamed of what happened here so many years ago
we keep these objects to remind us that this will never again happen in my kingdom
after a moment im sorry if ive offended you
now more trays are whisked in by servants
short rounds monkey suddenly screeches and takes off
willie closed here eyes in dread but curiosity gets the best of her and she looks its worse than she could imagine plates full of small dead monkey heads
production note be cause of his extremely sensitive nature the director has reque ted that these monkey heads be simulated
the tops of the monkeys skulls have been cut off and sit loose like little covers
willie watches in utter dismay as the maha rajah and his guests remove the skull tops and start dipping spoons into whats inside merchant contd chilled monkey brains
willie keels over crashing backwards in a dead faint
women servants help a woobly kneed willie toward her room
hundreds of lanters illuminate the garden where after dinner drinks are served cigars lighted and hookah pipes puffed on
indiana comes out of the pavilion into the garden with capt
blumburtt and they talk quietly
rather bizarre menu woundnt you say
even if they were trying to scare us away a devout hindu would never touch meat
looking around makes you wonder what these people are
now the little maharajah comes over with his retinue and he reaches for indys whip which short round is carrying
i have seen this thing
what is it dr
hey nobody touches indys whip
short round grabs for it but indiana restrains him
were guests here shorty
the maharajah glares are short round and five the whip to indy
you will show me how it works please
indy bows to the little prince and smiles ironically you wish is my command your highness
while short round watches angrily indiana walks across the gar den and unfurls the whip
indy sees a servant lighting a candle
suddenly the whip flies and cracks like a pistol shot
the candle disappears
indiana whirls and cracks the whip again snagging a flower out of a dancing girls hair
the maharajah reacts like any kid he shoops happily
that is wonderful
please teach me how
short round sulks as he listens to indiana instructing the maha rajah on how to hold the whip
as the young prince practises the grip indy notices chattar lal slip behind a fountain to talk to a dark figure in robes who appears
indiana sees chattar lal bow to the dark figure and indy catches a glimpse of the strangers pale face and dark hollow eyes
then the robled apparition seems to disappear
meanwhile everyone watches respectfully as the maharajah unfurls the whip for his first attempt
he flings the whip but it flies back and snaps biting his own cheek
theres a stunned silence then short round laughs at the little prince who is holding his wounded cheek
the incensed ma rahajah suddenly flashes the whip as short round
short round grabs the end of it and pulls hard the whip is tugged taut between the two hostile boys
as they draw near each other short round sees something weird the little maharajahs eyes begin glowing yelloe and he hisses softly in a strange voice
nobody else sees or hears the bizarre transformation
indiana finally intercedes he grabs short round by the neck
okay short round let go of it
short round lets go and indy gently takes the whip back from the little prince
indiana contd the turks say that a whip can be an enemy even to its owner
if you get some rope itll be easier to learn with your highness
now i think well say goodnight
the maharajah and short round stare hostiley at each other as indy recoils his whip
short round walks beside indiana down the shadowy hall toward their room
short round has indys whip curled around his shoul der
the little fellow yawns and shakes his head
that little maharajah think he big stuff
you dont like him do you
next time i flatten him
did you see his eyes
indy they glow like fire and get real crazy
then he talk in this real scary voice
indy tousles short rounds hair
he was afraid of you
he knows a tough guy when he sees one
not so shure yeah thats what happened
they reach their room and short round opens the door
i better see how willie is
short round shakes his head scornfully as indy crosses the hall and knocks on another door
after a moment the door opens and willie is standing there in a tempting nightgown
i brought you something
he holds up something wrapped in a piece of silk
disgusted not leftovers
no real food
willie opens the bundle suspiciously then her hace lights up as she examines the breads and fruits inside
oh it is real food
she bites happily into a piece of fruit its juice runs down her chin and indy wipes it off gently with his hand
the mouth deliberately seductive and willie is not displeased
willie contd youre nice
listen im taking applications howd you like to be my palace slave
smiling wearing your jewels to be prin cess
indy touches her necklace then his hand caresses her neck and ear
she shivers slightly and speaks softly
yeah and nothing else
smiling that shock you
shaking his head im a scientist
i like doing research on certain nocturnal activities she smiles and puts a grape to his lips
he opens his mouth takes it and chews it
you mean like love rituals
he swallows the grape and they move toward each other slowly to kiss revealing the passion thats simmering
and mating customs
they kiss again more heatedly
primitive sexual practices
youre taling to an authority in that area
they kiss again hungrily youre dying to come into my room arent you
you want me so bad why dont you invite me
too proud to admit youre crazy about me dr
i think youre too used to get ting you own way willie
they kiss yet again and indy breaks it off just to show hes still in control
he backs away toward his room
watching him well see who gives in first ill leave my door open
dont catch cold
indy stops by his door and sees willie smiling as she holds up five fingers willie contd five minutes
youll be back over here in five minutes
youre dreaming willie
you want to make it real just knock on my door
but neither one will surrender first
willie does into her room leaving the door ajar
indy opens his door
indy comes in and closes the door leaving it open a crack
he stands and listens waiting for her to come over
willie stands likewise by her door waiting to hear indy come back over
indiana shrugs and walks over to a couch and starts taking off his tweed jacket and necktie five minutes
willie moves around her lavish suite turning down lights creating a romantic effect checking herself in a mirror confidently five minutes dr
indy undresses in the magnificently decorated room wall paint ings show palace scenes and landscapes life size figures dance and there are full scale portraits or rajput princes and prancing
but indys more concerned with lust than with art
muttering want me to be her palace slave
he picks up his whip and smiles considering using it on her
then he just grubles and tosses the bullwhip onto the couch
lying in bed in a seductive pose willie waits for indy to show up and she starts to look worried
she grabs a clock and shakes it to see if its working
she taps her fingers irritably won dering in her charm has failed
we see another clock ticking
looking annoyed indy tosses a boot at it and the clock falls on its face setting of the alarm
on the chaise lounge in front of indys bed short round moves groggily and sees indy turning off the alarm
half asleep get to sleep indy i stay up and keep eye on things
see you in the morning
im going to have a little word with willie
indy finally shakes his head and gives in to his animal instincts
he buttons his shirt puts his boots back on and grabs his leather jacket
as he puts on his jacket he walks past the life sized paintings of armed gaurds standing in silent vigil
suddenly we see something frightening behind him one of the wall paintings sees to come to life
a large figure in robes and a turban looms out from the wall and lifts a silk cord the figure wraps the cord suddenly around indianas neck
the huge assassin stands behind indy twisting the cord even tighter around his neck
as indy attempts to break free he sees the assassins face is a mirror and a strange yellow light glowing in the killers eyes
willies finally had enough waiting and she gets out of beg petu lantly
hes not coming
i cant be lieve it
she walks across the room and opens the door
she looks out the empty hall and her resolve starts to weaken willie contd well
bracing herself no
im not going over there
she comes back into her room and kicks the door closed
willie contd sleep tight dr
suddenly melancholy i couldve been your greatest ad venture
indy shoves the assassin backwards ramming the big man into the wall
the assassin maintains his deathgrip while on the chaise short round sleeps through it all
gasping futilely for air indy sinks slowly to his knees his eyes bulge and he stares at the tiny smiling skulls at the ends of the death cord wrapped around
the assassins fists
indiana sinks lower and then feels something desperately he grabs a brass pot on the floor by the handle and swings it with his last strength smashing it up into
the assassins head with a skull crushing clang
the assassin is stunned and indiana curls forward pulling him into a somersault and sening him flying over his back
the ass assin crashes on his sping next to the chaise
short round still doesnt wake up
indiana rips the cord from around his neck and gasps for breath
he sees the assassin pulling a knife
indiana dives as the knife flies through the air and slams into the wall
indiana grabs his whip rolls and lands on his feet
as the ass assin tries to retreat indy unleashes his whip it cracks and wraps around the killers neck
the big man struggles pulling on the whip trying to release it from his throat and indiana holds fast watching the killer gasping for air now as his face turns
suddenly the assassin does a full blown backward sommersault which rips the whip out of indys hand
the assassin has an in stant to grin victoriously until he sees that the whip handle is arching toward the ceiling where is gets caught on the revolving fan
the surprised assass in it tugged upwards and the whip twists around the ceiling fan like fishing line around a fishing reel and like a doomed flounder the assassin is
slowly reeled up and dragged toward the ceiling his toes lifting off the floor
the assassin screams as he is hanged
his legs twitch in his death throes and below him short round finally wakes up
always indianas protector shorty instictively leaps off the couch and draws a small dagger dont worry indy
where are they
short round spins a then looks up and does a double take seeing the dead assassin twisting slowly around the ceiling fan
indy takes short rund by the shoulders and turns him away from the grisly sight
its okay its over go turn off the fan
short goes over and turns off the fan the assassins body drops and indy recoils his whip
suddenly they hear a hideous scream willie
in a tight close up willie screams again
shes lying in bed looking down at something moving up her shapely leg a green and black monstrous looking insect crawls onto her stomach and willie stops breather
immo bilized by fear willie watches in silent agony as the hideous insect climbs slowly up her breast and slithers toward her neck
across the suite the doors burst open and indiana rushes in
shorty is behind him carrying indys whip
indiana leaps on a stools and slides up to the bed to save willie then he spots the giant insect crawling on her and decides to have some fun
this a cheap trick to get me over here
willie speaks with desperate fearful precision no dont you see crawling what the bug
willie is petrified and shaking
get the bug off
gee i wouldnt want to touch an ugly critter like that
grinning uh uh me neither
willie looks at the man of action like hes insane
then she feels the bug crawling onto her cheek oh no oh no
studying the bug you know willie ill bet hes mad because they were eating his friends for dinner
please oh please im going to die
get it off
indiana shrugs and leans over and casually swats the horrible bug off her face
he and short round watch the insect skid across the floor and suddenly disappear as if by magic
puzzled they wander toward the wall leaving willie behind bathed in sweat staring at the ceiling what did i do to deserve this trip
kneeling by the wall short round examines the baseboard it went under
hey i feel wind indy
indiana knocks on the wall and considers the hollow sound
he moves back and looks at the whole wall
behind him willie moves past im packing
im getting out of here right now tonight
she dashes behind a screen to start getting dressed
meanwhile indy feels the marble walls
he moves to a niche in which there is a small statue of ganesha the friendly elephant god
indiana lifts the statue and a panel in the wall opens slow ly
short round looks amazed
indy watches the light fall across the far wall of a tunnel as the door opens slowly
indy peers into the tunnel at an old wall painting
spiderly san skrit calligraphy runs under a flanking illustration of a prince bowing before a god
he reads aloud an inscription in sanskrit
what does it mean indy
translating follow in the footsteps of shiva
do not betray his truth
indy takes out the piece of cloth the boy gave him in mayapore the similarities are striking
it is also a picture of shiva sankara
he repeats aloud the inscrip tion also written on the cloth over behind the screen willies getting into some silk pants with an indian style brocade bodice top i dont
care if i have to walk to delhi im hey
she notices indy and short round bending to enter the dark tunnel behind the wall
willie contd wait a minute
whatre you wherere you going
indy pokes his head back into the room lock your door and dont leave until we get back
he disappears behind the wall and willie looks worried
indy and short round enter the secret passage and move forward slowly into the inky darkness
i dont think we suppose to be in here indy
they creep slowly down the dark tunnel
it grows smaller and indy ducks his head
short round contd i step on something
their footsteps crunch on the tunnel floor
youre right theres something all over the floor
even short round has to duck and indy finally kneels to his hands and knees
indiana contd well have to crawl
as they crawl their hands and knees continue to crunch on what ever it is littering the ground
indy the floor there is some thing alive
indiana gets a match out of his pocket
he snaps it with his thumb and the match flares a hideous insectarium a living collection of the worlds ugliest antropods hexapods and arch nids
holy smoke im scared indy
indiana turns and sees something else theres a chamber here
come on indy finds an oil lamp on the wall and lights it
short round happily scampers into the chamber and indy follows him
suddenly the door slides shut trapping them inside
indiana lights a match and finds another oil lamp
he and short round look for a way to open the door that closed behind them but they have no luck
then they hear willies voice echoing down the short tunnel
hey where are you
back in the suite willie stands by the entrance to the secret passage peering into the dark tunnel willie contd indiana jones
are you in there
indy mutters irritably to himself yes were in here
he looks everywhere for something to open the door
short round spots a loose brick and moves it indy i found a suddenly they hear a rumble and indy turns to see the opposite wall moving the spikes start
their lethal points protrude from the wall as it starts closing in toward indy and short round
short round contd indy
shorty points up and indiana sees more spikes descending from the ceiling
indy turns toward the door and shouts uh willie
louder willie you better get down here
willie listens and looks scared shouting back what
willie come here
hurry up were in trouble
willie is frightened confused and jumping around the deadly spikes inch slowly toward them from the wall and ceil ing
they start pounding on the door and shout willie damn it
get down here willie finds the courage to finally whimper and step into the dark passage oh hell i bet i get all dirty again
willie starts down the dark tunnel toward the chamber
im coming whats the rush
theres stuff all over the floor
i cant see a thing
they hear her coming and indy watches nervously as the spikes draw even closer move willie
willie crawls and crunches on the littered floor its all wet and icky
aaahh things are moving
she sees the low lamp by the door to the chamber
she grabs the lamp and turns it up so it burns brighter
she looks around and screams
she sees the sickening swarming mass of glistening insects crawling toward her attracted by the light hysterical theres bugs
bugs all over
willie open the door
get us willie pounds on the door the spikes close in get us out
willie shut up and listen
theres got to be a ful crum release
willie whines and frantically searches the wall
insects are crawling and jumping on her and she kicks at them
a fulcrum release lever
i cant find any lever
help me indy
indiana and short round are backed against the wall and the spikes are a foot away and moving in look around willie
theres got to be a liever hidden somewhere
come on you can do it
insects drop onto willie from the ceiling and fly at her as she flattens against the wall
then her elbow hits something a loose stone
she claws at it and it falls out of the wall leaving a hole
theres a hole
i found a square hole
thats it the release lever look inside
i am it looks horrible
the hole is revolting covered with squirming insects it also oozes some kind of glistening mucus
willie moves her hand toward the nauseating hole then pulls back
i cant indy
indiana turns his head sideways and sucks in his breath but the deadly spikes are poking into his leater jacket now the lever
willie do it
willie screams and jams her hand into the gross hole oh god its soft its moving
short round is frightened to death and crying willie help us
she hears short round crying and twists her hand in the disgust ing hole
suddenly the door springs open
willie pulls her hand out and stares in horror her hand and arm are covered with greenish slimey mung
the spikes suddenly retract disappearing into the wall and clos ing
indy pulls willie inside the chamber and the door slams shut again
willie dances around yelling about the hideous slime on her arm
get is off me get it off
indy helps her wipe it off
willie falls back against the door
willie contd you left me out there
what in the hell were you doing in here
i want to leave this place right now
she sees the same lever that short round pulled earlier and grabs for it
indiana dives and manages to stop her from activating the spikes agian
not that one
we had enought of that one thank you
he looks around and spots a small rock protruding from the wall
cautiously praying htat it wont activate another booby trap indy pushes the rock
a large door opens on the other side of the chamber a soft wind howls past outside the chamber
indiana short round and willie exit the spike chamber and head down a larger tunnel through which a roaring wind intermittantly blows howling eerily like a note of gloomy music
indiana follows a curve in the tunnel and they see light approaching
the wind holws another dramatic note which gales past them as they reach the mouth of the tunnel
indiana is joined by willie and short round
they all stop in astonishment at the sight below them as the camera pulls back the mouth of the wind tunnel in which they are standing becomes just a small
hole overlooking the stag gering vastness of the incredible temple of death
the colossal subterranean temple has been carved out of a solid mass of rock
a vaulting cathedral like ceiling is supported by rows of carved stone columns
balconies overlook the temple floor
pillared halls leading to dark side chambers
moving out of these chambers hundreds of faithful worshippers chant as they enter the temple
mammoth stone statues of elephants lions and demi gods half man half animal monstrosities loom above the swelling crowds or wor shippers
as the wind howls out of the tunnel high above the temple the worshippers chant in response to the strange tunnel music
the moaning wind rushes past indiana willie and short round as they watch the mystery cult below bowing toward an enormous altar at the far end of the temple
this altar is a platform jutting out from the stone wall of the cavern
separating the worshippers from this altar is a wide crevasse out of which wisps of smoke rise occasionally
on the other side of the crevasse evil looking priests materialize out of clouds of swirling smoke
the priests carry smoke billowing urns to a giant stone statue
now we see the hideous protectress of the temple the obscenely malevolent ombect of the cults devotion the bloodthirsty god dess kali
the red eyed priests bow at the base of the statue and gaze reverently at their kali ma
skulls surround her stone feet carved serpents twist up her legs while around her waist there is a guresome belt of human hands
naked to the hips kalis hair falls about her four arms
in her hand she holds a sword in the second the severed head of a giant
with her other hands she encourages her worshipers who are chanting louder and louder
kalis face is loathsome her earrings are two corpses
her evil tongue extends out of her twisted mouth and what looks like read blood flows over her long fangs and down her naked breasts
watching from the high opening willie looks disgusted
what is it
its a thuggee ceremony
theyre whorshipping kali the goddess of death and destruction
a huge drum sounds three times and the chanting stops
the silence is chilling as another robed figure appears out of the some on the altar
this is mola ram the high priest of the thugge cult
mola rams red rimmed eyes glare from the sunken sockets in his sinister face
here is a man who looks as vile and diabolic as the unholy goddess rising behind him
up in the wind tunnel indy stares down at the high priest and realizes that is was mola ram he saw conferring with chattar lal in the palace garden
as the drum booms three times more mola ram lifts one arm up from his emaciated body and suddenly there is a scream
all heads turn toward an unfortunate struggling indian begin dragged out by priests
the mans face and body are wildly painted
he screams again as hes tied onto a square iron frame laying atop a large flat stone
mola ram steps forward to the stretched out victim and the indian looks up into the high priests grotesque face suddenly mola rams hand shoots out toward the mans chest
and pierces it
the high priests hand sinks into the victims writing body and rips out his living heart
willie covers her mouth oh my god
he ripped out his he killed him
the hearts still beating
indeed the bloody heart is still beating in mola rams hand
he lifts the heart into the air and the worhippers begin the chant
jai ma kali jai ma kali
stranger still the sacrificial victim is still alive there is no evidence of a gash on his chest only a reddish mark the priests add chains to the iron frame
and carry the victim over toward a hoist hanging over the crevasse
the man thrashes about helplessly on the iron frame as it is up ended and then lowered with the victim hanging face down as the sacrificial victim looks down into
the crevasse below he screams and we see the molten lava bubbling crimson at the bottom of the chasm
willie closes her eyes but indy and short round watch horrified as the iron frame is lowered and the bloody heart continues to beat in mola rams hand and the
molten lava burns and flickers as the screaming victim is lowered deeper into the crevasse
the weird paint on the victims face starts to smoke and sizzle the mans skin blisters as hes lowered within feet of the lava
his flesh smokes and he screams one last time as his body bursts into flame
the iron frame sinks and submerges into the boiling fiery lava
above the crevasse mola ram continues to hold the heart in his hand the heart is smoking and bursts into flames and disappears
the iron frame is raised out of the lava the metal glows like a branding iron but there is no trace of the sacrificed victim
as the wind howls again willie and short round look sickened and appalled by the ceremony
even indy seems shaken by what they are witnessing
jai ma kali jai ma kali
moal ram raises both hands and his voice echoes strange incanta tions
behind him three priests carry cloth wrapped objects to ward the altar
willie is crying and her voice is shoking as she turns awa from the hideous ritual lets go
lets get out of here
the priests reverently unwrap three conical pieces of crystallized quartz
the place the three stones below the sta tue of kali and slowly the smoke around the altar swirls the smoke is drawn to the three stones and they actually
start in haling the piraling smoke
the smoke disappears into the stones and the air clears
then the three stones start to glow a haunting incandescent white
short round looks scared
willie is still crying indy waits horrified but fascinated
the village knew their rock was magic but they didnt know it was one of the lost sankara stones
why they glow like that
legend says that when the stones are brought together the diamonds inside of them will glow
willie wipes her eyes and becomes more interested diamonds
the sankara stones shimmer brightly and inside the crystallized quartz the enormous sparkling diamonds of legend are now re vealed
mola ram stands facing kali with his arms outstretched and kneels and bows and then walks off the altar and disappears
indiana sees the woshippers below start to leave the temple
he looks at willie and short round
okay now listen you wait here and keep quiet
shorty keep an eye on her
short round nods and hands indy his bullwhip and shoulder bag
willie sees indiana peering down at the sheer drop below the mouth of the wind tunnel
wait whatre you doing
im going down
are you crazy
im not leaving without those stones
youre gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory
looking at her maybe
smiling not today
i keep my eye peeled indy
indiana nods and looks down at the now empty temple
then he slips down from the mouth of the wind tunnel
indiana skillfully clumbs down an enormous tmeple column find ing footholds on stone cobras carved lions and the stone breasts of dancing girls
slowly he makes his way down and swings across a balcony
indiana walks quietly along the balcony overlooking the temple
he stops between him and the altar is the crevasse with the lava bubbling fire at the bottom
indiana looks across the gulf and sees another column near the altar at the top of which stone elephants are perched
indy curls his whip and suddenly lets it fly the whip cracks and its end wraps tightly around the tusk of one of the stone elephants
from the balcony indy tugs the whip taut takes a breath and runs indiana leaps and swings out on the whip arching down and up over the chasm of fiery
lava in a spectacular curving jump
indy lands on his feet and turns to release the whip
short round waves to indy that the coast is clear
indy snaps the whip it releases from the elephant tusk and drops
recurling the whip indy attaches it to his belt and moves to ward the towering statue of kali
the three sankara stones start to glow and indiana approaches them cautiously
reaching the stones indys face is lighted by them
he notices that one of them sthe stone from mayapore village has strange lines painted across it
suspiciously indy touches the stone but it doesnt burn
he lifts it carefully and peers into it
the enormous diamond sparkles inside
he places the stone in his shoulder bag and reaches for the others
short round and willie watch apprehensively as indiana bags the three stones
indiana backs away and looks up at the horrific statue of kali
it seems to be watching him
he turns and is about to go when he hears something it sounds like a voice and indy is afraid to turn could it be kali
the he hears other noises echoing and turns slowly
real alizing the sounds are coming from behind the altar indy moves around it toward the back
short round and willie are mystified as they see indiana dissap pear behind the altar
oh hell wheres he going
short round looks worried
then the wind rushes past them quickly and howls its somber musical note
however the wind sounds dif ferent this time its tone quavering slightly
short round is puzzled and looks around
he feeezes when he sees two shadowy figures coming down the tunnel toward them the bodies causing the tone of the wind to shift eerily willie notices short round pulling
a dagger from his belt whatre you
suddenly she turns and screams as two huge thuggee guards rush at them
one grabs at short round but the kid slashes the guards hand with his dagger
willie tries to get past the other guard but he snatches her by the arm and pulls her toward him from her training at the col lege of hard knocks
willie successfully knees the big man in the balls
willie contd keep your paws off letch
the man groans and sinks to his knees
willie sees that short round is in trouble
she runs over leaps onto the back of the other guard and starts ripping his hair out
short round picks up his fallen dagger
the big guard lurches backwards and smashes willie into the rocky wall of the tunnel
willie falls to the floor
short round approaches holding the man at bay with his dagger
willie turns as the other guard the one she kneed crawls toward her willie scoops up some dirt and throws it
the man claws at his eyes and willie jumps up
willie starts to run and short round backs away keeping the guard at a distance with his dagger
suddenly the guard cries out in hindi and dives at short round
panicking shorty tries to run after willie but hes tripped
the guard has short round by the foot and drags him back
willie looks around and stops running
she sees short round is caught
short round contd no
go get help
willie hesitates then runs down the tunnel
meanwhile a mam moth hand clutches short rounds throat the giant guard lifts shorty completely off the ground and the kid looks terrified and helpless as he dangles in the
indiana enters the dark chamber behind the altar
the only il lumination is the back light streaming around the silhouetted statue of kali
indy slowly crosses a narrow stone bridge and moves toward a cy lindrical shaft of light rising up from what appears to be an enormous hole
indy hears voices and the clink of metal against rock as he con tinues forward
the ground is dark in front of the large hole
he edges toward the precipice and the light rising up illuminates the look of shock on his face as he peers down into hell
indy looks into a deep pit around which concentric paths leads off into numerous narrow tunnels
crawling out of these burrows scrawny children drag sacks of dirt and rock
other hollow eyed children pull these sacks to mine cars waiting on rails
straining to lift the rocks into the mine cars several of the children slip and fall
bare chested thuggee guards shout at the enslaves children and kick those whove fallen
for these children there would seem to be only one hope death an end to their travail
indiana edges around the hole looking into the ghastly mine and feeling as if hes discovered an inferno of misery as grotesque as dantes
indy shifts the bag of stones on his shoulder
he hesitates and considers his choice he has the sankara stones and can leave with them now
but indy hears the pleading cries of one child and peers down to see a burly thuggee guard beating the pitiful little slave
indy gets angrier and angrier as he watches
he finally steps over the grabs a boulder
he lifts it and flings it down into the mine we see indiana above and the boulder hurtling down it crashes onto the head of the thuggee guard who hits
the ground like a sack of cement
indy sees the startled slave children looking up at him in shock
he smiles victoriously at the thuggees below whove run over to see what happened
indys smile seems to fade as his anger turns to surprise as he feels something unnerving dirt is crumbling away from the rim of the hole a small landslide starting
beneath his feet
suddenly the floor gives way and indy slips
the entire rim of the hole shears off and indy topples with it and plunges down into the mine toward the assembled guards who scatter indy yells as he falls
and it echoes
indianas yell continues to echo his head jerks suddenly indy jolts awake as if coming out of a nightmare awakened by his own reverberating shout
indy is lying on the rocky floor of a dark cave cell
he lifts his hands and discovers that they are chained
in the murky light he sees short round sitting in chains across the cell
indy you knocked out when you fall
indiana nods groggily
he sees a young slave worker in rags sit ting near short round
through the iron bars of the cell indy sees the children slaving in the mine tunnels
indicating the kid this is nainsukh from the vil lage
they bring him here to dig in the mines
children are small we can work in tunnels
now i am too old
what they do to you now
i pray to shiva let me die
but i do not
now now the evil of kali take me
they will make me drink blood of kali
then i fall into black sleep of kali ma
what is that
i become like them
i be alive nut like in nightmare
you drink the blood you not wake up from nightmare of kali ma
theres a noise and they see two guards and a priest outside the cell
nainsukh cowers in the darkness at the back of the cell like a trapped animal awaiting the inevitable
indiana and short round are pushed down a tunnel by guards
they are stopped at a door and shoved inside
indiana and short round stumble into the chamber
it is a terri fying gallery of occult yantras ritualistic statues and grisly icons of the evil thuggee sect
grotesque statues of kalis baleful minions line the walls
in a corner there is another statue of kali herself draped with flowers necklaces of real human skills and slithering belts of live snakes
fresh blood has been splashed over the statue and at its base are the three sankara stones recovered from indiana
mola ram sits in a yoga position near the statue of kali
mola ram opens his eyes and he sees indiana and short round standing in chains before him
you were caught trying to steal the sankara stones
shrugging nobodys perfect
the way i heard it you stole one of them from a small village
mola ram stands and gazes transfixed at the stones glowing on the altar
there were five stones in the beginning
over the centuries they were dispersed by wars sold off by thieves like you
two are still missing
they are here somewhere
a century ago when the british raided this temple and butchered my people a loyal priest his the last two stones down here in the catacombs
thats what youve got these chil dren these slaves digging for
they dig for the gems to support our cause
they also search for the last two stones
soon we will have all five sankara stones and the thuggees will be all powerful
nobody can say you dont have a vivid imagination
you do not believe me
you will dr
you will become a true believer
the door opens and mola ram bows slightly as the little maharajah enters
indy looks surprised and short round tenses
mola ram contd your highness will witness the thiefs conversion
mola ram nods and two guards grab indy
they drag him struggling to a rock and chain him to it
short round scuffles as hes pulled aside to watch
remembering the high priests earlier open heart surgery indi ana looks worried as mola ram approaches him you will not suffer
i recently became of age and tasted the blood of kali
now the young initiate comes forward and indiana looks startled its nainsukh
he is wearing robes and his eyes are glowing strangely
nainsukh hands mola ram a hollow human skull full of blood
the guards hold indianas head back and force his mouth open
mola ram tips the skull and blood spills out of its death grinning jaws and flows into indianas mouth
indy gags suddenly he spits the blood spraying mola ram and the little maharajah
looking at his blood splattered clothes the mahara jah is furious
the little princes eyes glow angrily and he hisses at indy you will learn to obey because you are powerless
the little maharajah pulls a small krtya from his robes indy sees that the doll has been crudely fashioned to resemble him
maharajah contd i control you now
the maharajah turns and sticks the doll into a flaming urn
in diana suddenly cries out and twists in pain as he is burned
the little prince smiles evilly and puts the doll back into his robes
then he goes over to where indys whip and bag have been laid
he grabs the bullwhip
maharajah contd you told me that a whip could be an enemy to its owner
we shall see
turn him over
as the guards turn indy face down they rip off his jacket and chain his ahnds to the rock
the maharajah uncurls the whip he notices short round smiling snidely suddenly the maharajah cracks the whip it lashes out and cuts into short rounds shoulder
blood appears and short round looks stunned by the lash and by the fact the marahajah knows who to use the whip
maharajah contd as dr
jones suggested i have been practicing
the little maharajah whirls and lashes the whip again
indiana jerks as the bullwhip rips through his shirt and tears open his flesh
the maharajah lashes again and again blood spurts across indys tattered shirt
as the whipping continues short round jumps as if he is also be ing beaten
his eyes fill with tears as he watches indy suffer
finally the little maharajah lets the whip fall limp
as the maharajah approaches indy short round lunges as him angrily but the guards restrain him
indiana groans as hes turned over
blood trickles from his mouth and he stares up hatefully at mola ram
the british in india will be slaughtered
then we will over run the moslems and force their allah to bow to kali
mola ram is once again given the human skull by a priest and he lifts it toward indys face mola ram contd and then the hebrew god will fall and
finally the christian god will be cast down and forgotten
indys head is held back and mola ram spills the blood it flows out of the mouth of the skull into indys mouth
mola ram contd soon kali ma will rule the world
indys eyes look horrified as the blood flows from the skull down his choking throat some of the blood spills and falls to the floor we see the very earth
trembling as the evil spreads a fissure appears beneath indys feet and a small line of crimson lava oozes out and smiles evilly across the floor
diaphanous curtains billow silently into the moonlighted room
two exotic birds sit on a golden perch their eyes clicking watchfully
suddenly the brids shriek and flap away willie stumbles through the secret door and falls into the room
insects cover her and she shimpers as she knocks them off
she manages to stagger to her feet and she heads for the door
willie rushes out of her room and runs through the deserted pal ace looking for help
she flies down the moonlit corridors past the huge wall paintings
she stops by a courtyard and calls out desperately but there is no one around
she backs away down a hallway and then jumps seeing something in a mirror a face looms behind her and she screams
willie whirls and sees chattar lal the prime minister approach ing her
oh my god you scared me
listen youve got to help
we found this tunnel captain blumburtt comes around a corner and interrupts to chattar lal jones isnt in his room
miss scott my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to delhi no you cant go
something aw fuls happened
theyve got short round and i think indys been what
we found a tennel that leads to a temple below the palace
please come with me ill show you
the two men exchange dubious looks
willie grabs blumburtt by the arm and they start down the hall
miss scott youre not making any sense
im afraid theyll kill them
we saw horrible things down there they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a mans heart out
its some kind of cult
and theyve got the sacred stones that indy was searching for
i sense the fumes of opium in all this
prehaps miss scott picked up the habit in shanghai
whatre you talking about im not a dope fiend
i saw it
ill show you
she leads them into her suite
willie points to the dark opening in the wall
blumburtt picks up an oil lamp and holds it toward the opening suddenly he jumps back as indiana emerges
smiling faintly whatre we playing hid and seek
theyre all startled
willie looks relieved and rushes over to indy and puts her arms around him
oh indy you got away
tell them what happened they wont believe me he puts his arms around her and feels her trembling from fear and anger
he walks her to the bed and helps her sit down its okay
youre all right now
they think im insane
tell them im not indy
please help me
the awful events have taken their toll and willie covers her face and cries like a scared kid
indy gets her to lie down on the bed
he sits beside her and smiles and touches her hair hey i thought you were supposed to be a real tropper
he wipes the tears from her face and she holds his hand quietly what
youve got to go to sleep now
softly i want to go home
i dont blame you
this hasnt been what youd call a fun vaca tion
she smiles a little despite herself and he touches her cheek
he eyes are already closing and he stands up
a servant is entering the suite to take care of willie
she cov sers her with a blanket and start dropping the mosquito netting as indy walks off toward the verandah with blumburtt and chattar lal
the first light is breaking over the mountain peaks
coming out onto the verandah indy and the other two men see the cavalry troops breaking camp below and readying their horses and trucks
ive spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels i shouldnt have let somebody like willie go in there with me
miss scott panicked
when she saw the insects she passed out cold
i carried her back to her room
she was sleeping when i re entered the tunnel to look around
as she slept she undoubtedly had nightmares
indiana looks at him and nods
then she must have run out of the room and you found her
did you discover anything in that tunnel dr
indiana stares into the rising sun
just a dead end
that tunnels been deserted for years
a sergeant major shouts up to blumburtt that the troops are ready
prime minister my re port will duly note that we found nothing unusual here in pankot
im sure that will please the maharajah captain
to indiana as i said before wed be happy to escort you to delhi
thanks but i dont think willie is ready to travel yet
dust swirls as the british cavalry moves off with their highland pipers at the head playing a military bagpipe tune
blum burtt comes out of the palace and gets into an open car
blumburtts car moves off behind the cavalry and then the supply trucks follow
the whine of the bagpipes is eerily muted in the dark room
through the gently swaying mosquito netting we see willie asleep on the bed
then through her side of the gauzy netting we see the door opening across the room
indiana enters quietly and moves toward the bed his eyes fixed on willies sleeping body
indy sits down on the bed slowly
willie turns in her sleep and opens her eyes
through the mosquito netting she sees indy sit ting with his back to her
did you walk to them
so now they believe me
yes they believe you
indiana speaks in a strange monotone
then theyll send the soldiers down into the temple
willie looks at indianas back and continues quietly
willie contd i was scared to death last night when i thought they were going to kill you
they wont kill me
smiling faintly you know youve been nothing but trouble since i hooked up with you but i have to admit id miss you if i lost you
now indiana starts to turn slowly
you wont lose me willie
she sees him turn and his face slowly comes toward the mosquito netting his face pushes into the netting and willie looks stunned as indys mouth opens he starts hissing
grotesquely smoke billows out of his mouth and the mosquito netting burns open to expose his terrifying face moving toward willie she is forzen with fear and unable to utter a sound as indys malevolent face looms at her and then she notices his eyes his eyes glowing a hellish luminscent yellow
she suddenly bolts from the bed and tries to run indiana goes into a rage ripping the mosquito netting from the bed as he fol lows her
ive found it you cant kali knows
willie tries the door but its locked
she sees indiana moving toward her ranting incoherently as he smashes a vase out of his way been too many lies theres no gods heaven just the horror
ive seen it life preying on life
willie cowers in a corner horrified by the transformation she sees in indiana
shouting and pacing indy holds his head against the pain of his terrible thoughts rivers destroying mountains a comet in space exploding
holding his head aaahh
the screams pitiful people their pain the hate and greed always greed
the light throws his shadow over willie a giant shadow float ing back and forth over her as she cries in the corner unable to fight the evil devouring indiana
but ive found kalis touch
death no more lies the death ive been searching for
shouting quit crying
she can hear you kali knows fear dont you under stand kali is freedom
indiana stops pacing and willie freezes in terror
now a bizarre yellow light wipes across the room
indiana turns and watches silently as two thuggee guards emerge from a secret doorway thats opened the shadows of the thuggee guards loom over willie and she screams again
a sea of frightening faces once again intones the horrible sacri ficial chant
among the shorshippers the little maharajah sits on a riased platform
like the other believers he stares across the crevasse at the altar of kali ma
the wailing wind howls out of the high tunnel and the terrifying chanting reaches a fever pitch
and once again the three sacred sankara stones glow magically
mola ram materializes evilly amidst the swirling smoke and he begins chanting in sanskrit
beside the altar half clad female acolytes pass in front of the robed priests with their fingers the women paint two white lines across the priests foreheads
an acolyte moves in front of chattar lal the prime minister is now dressed in robes
as the devotional markings are painted on his forehead chattar lal translates the high priests speech to indiana who stands next to him
mola ram is telling the faithful of out victory
he says the british have left the palace which proves kali mas new power
yes i understand
indiana bows his head to receive the mystical markings
he lis tens to mola rams rantings indys eyes are ominously vacant as he stares up at the hideous statue of kali
beneath the temple down in the bowels of the mountain the piti ful children dig at the earth with their fingers
a fat guard slouches down the tunnel flogging malingerers with a aleather strap
short round sweats next to the others clawing at the rocks doomed to work with them now in their search for the last wo sankara stones
the leather strap suddenly flays short rounds back and he barely manages not to scream out in pain
the fat guard passes short round and the other kids pull a large rock which suddenly comes loose out of the wall
they fall back and see theyve exposed a vein of molten lava
hearing their shouts the fat guard returns yelling at their stupidity he whips them and shoves them aside brutally
short round see the fat guards eyes glowing fiercely in anger
suddenly the fissure shoots out steam and spews some molten lava over the guards legs
the guard screams and falls to the ground thrashing about try ing to kick the searing lava off his smoking flesh
as the other kids cower short rounds humane instincts cause him to jump forward to help the guard who moments earlier was beating him short round tosses dirt on the
guards legs and grabs a gunny sack and starts rubbing the lava off
shorty notices something strange the guards eyes which were glowing yellow before are now dim ming and returning to normal
the moaning guard looks at shorty thankfully and then looks around as if waking from a nightmare to another slave kid his eyes they go out
other guards appear and lift the guard suddenly he starts struggling against the guards not wanting to return to the night mare of kali as hes dragged away no
the pain the pain makes him wake up
thinking quickly indy
i can make indy wake up
but the other guards push and beat the children back to work
short round is shoved against a wall and groans he reaches over and grabs a large rock lifting it defiantly but rather than heaving it at the guard short round
smashes the rock down on the leg chains binding him to the other children
shorty beats at the chain with the rock determined to escape
the wind moans and joins mola rams voice echoing maniacally over the multitude gathered in the enormous temple
on his throne the little maharajah listens transfixed
chattar lal watches indiana staring hypnotically at the high priest as he speaks you understand what he tells us
kali ma protects us now and for ever and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood
suddenly htere is a heart rending scream of terror and the priests draf forward the next sacrificial victim indianas glowing eyes watch emotionlessly as willie is brought out
dressed in a rajput maidens outfit willie has been jewel ed and draped with flowers a strange contrast as she struggles desperately
your friend has seen and she has heard now she will not talk
as willie is dragged past she sees indy and calls to him indy
willie is shocked seeing that indiana remains impassive and un caring as shes dragged to her death
to indy this will prove your devotion to kali
indiana looks away from willies terrified face and stares up adoringly at the monstrous statue of his goddess kali
in the dark tunnel a rock smashes down onto a chain and breaks it
short round is exhausted
he looks around furtively and sees a guard approaching
short round takes a chance he dives and rolls across the tunnel
he ducks behind a mine car full of rocks being pushed out by two chained children
the guard lumbers past unsuspectingly as short round makes his escape using the moving mine car as cover
up in the temple willie continues to struggle as her legs are strapped to the iron sacrifical frame
chattar lal grabs her hand and ties it down
willies free hand reaches out imploring ly toward indiana hoarsely please god dont let them do this to me help me indy
he reaches out slowly and willie grabs his hand tightly
indy looks into her eyes and then stares at her hand and slowly lifts it and starts tying it to the iron frame
willie contd no no
willie cries is disbelief as indiana calmly betrays her
short round races up a tunnel and then flattens himself behind a corner
he peers anxiously into a large carven and sees two guards walking away
when the coast is clear short round darts across the cavern to a long wooden ladder tilted up against a wall
short round looks up the high ladder and sees a kid with a sack of rocks descending from a burrow hole half way up the wall
the exhausted kid nearly collapses at the bottom then jumps seeing short round
shorty motions for him to keep quiet
amaxed the kid watches short round scramble up the ladder
shorty continues until he is high above the floor
dirty faces stare out of the high burrow as short round stops climbing
the kids are astonished as short round suddenly grunts and kicks the ladder away from the wall
the high ladder falls in an arc and what seem like sure suicide slowly resembles a mini indiana junes stunt as short round swings to the other side of the
falling ladder short round holds on for dear life as the ladder crashes against the opposite cavern wall giving short round access to the roof hole that leads up to the temple
short round scurries up the ladder and pulls himself up into the chamber behind the altar
he looks at the light flaring around the statue of kali indy
chains clank and gears grind as the sacrificial frame is raised over the crevasse
stretched out on it willie looks horrified as she hangs suspended face down above the boiling lava
the frame and victim descend slowly into the crevasse and the crowd around the little maharajah changs louder
short round dashes across the dark chamber behind the altar
he peers out and sees willie disappearing into the crewasse
he sees indiana watching impassively no indy wake up
then shorty sees a flaming torch hanging on a wall bracket and he has an idea
short round suddenly darts out onto the altar and mola ram sees him and yells
several priests grab for shorty
he eludes the first priest smashes the second in the stomach with his head and runs like a little quarterback toward the fiery torch short round snatches the torch from
the wall and charges toward indiana
seeing him coming indys eyes start glowing yellow and when short round runs up to him indiana suddenly swings and backhands the little guy brutally across the face
the torch flies out of shortys hand as hes knocked against at wall by indys vicious blow short round wipes a little blood from his chin and stares at his
hero in wounded disbelief
chattar lal watches approvingly a priest moves toward shorty
chattar lal looks back toward the crevasse willie hangs on the lowering frame heat waves rising up now to scald her skin and she chokes as the sulphuric air burns
meanwhile short round is crawling backwards across the floor with a look of terror on his face indiana stalks him hissing snarling his eyes lgowing short round springs to his
feet and tries to run indy grabs him and pulls him shortys hand grabs for another wall torch and just manages to yank it free
indiana spins short round and clutches his throat
as indy strangles him short round struggles and finally jams the torch into indys side
the fiery torch burns indy smoking as it sears his flesh and he yells in pain
its just a nightmare indy
wake up please indy
indiana writhes in pain and short round sees the evil yellow glow in indys eyes getting dimmer and finally going out
now it seems like theold indiana staring at him short round contd indy you back
suddenly a priest grabs short round and pulls him off indiana
give him to me
short round is firghtened as indy grabs him from the priest
indy lifts short round into the air no indy no
he sets short round down on the brink of the crevasse an inch from doom
shorty looks down at the lava and is terrified
indiana finally flahses him a quick smile and winks
then indiana whirls and punches the priest in the face
short round cheers realizing that indiana is back
short round contd we got to help willie
indiana springs into action stopping another priest with a quick punch in the stomach
then he rushes over to the crankwheel and pulley platform
indy jumps onto it yanking one priest off who spills onto the floor
a second priest who works the controls lowering the sacrificial frame sees indy and releases the crankwheel down in the crevasse willie screams as the iron frame suddenly plummets toward
the fulminating lava
on the platform the priest lunges at indiana indy uses the mans own momentum to throw him over his head
indy then dives for the crankwheel and manages to stop it down in the crevasse the fram jolts to a stop only yards above the spumes of fiery lava
the heat is so intense now that wil lies clothes start smoking and she passes out
on the platform above indiana cranks furiously raising the sa crificial frame
the chanting stops at the kali worshippers notice the battle on the altar
the little maharajah looks concerned and leaves shoving through the crowd behind his bodyguards
mola ram shouts at his priests and another one of them runs to ward indy on the platform
short round dives and tackles the priest
chattar lal finally leaps onto the crankwheel platform and indy sees him pull a dagger
he slashes at indiana and indy has to let go of the crankwheel the gears scream and the chains screech
below in the crevasse the iron frame plunges again toward the crimson lava
on the platform indy hears the frame lowering and looks pan icked
chattar lal slahses again with the dagger keeping indy away from the cogwheel mechanism indy suddenly kicks the dagger from chattar lals hand slugs him in the stomach and dives
toward the cogwheel mechanism
he grabs a iron rod and throws it into the gears the gears mangle the iron rod but finally grind to a stop
indi ana grabs the crankwheel and starts winding it up furiously
meanwhile short round jumps onto the platform with indy and grabs a long wrench
he starts swinging the wrench keeping the last priests off the platfrom
the sacrificial frame finally rises up into view and indiana grabs it and swings it over onto the platform
he looks at wil lie anxiously as he releases her bindings willie moans and moves her head
indy pulls her off the frame and she starts coughing
gasping for breath willie ervives as fresh air flows into her lungs
finally willie opens her eyes and she sees indiana
then she notices something else and manages to cry out hoarsely look out
chattar lal grabs a pistol from an unconscious guard and indiana whirls to see him pointing it indy kicks the gun from his hand and suddenly chattar lal starts shouting
in a terrifying voice chattar lals eyes glow as he lunges suicidally at indiana at tempting to take indy with him as he dives from the platform
crashing into indy chattar lal knocks both of them back onto the sacrificial frame which swings out over the crevasse indy manages to dive off the frame just in time
he grabs hold of the platform as the crankwheel screams and the frame falls
looking up from the depths of the crevasse we see the frame with chattar lal on it plummeting downward into the sulphurous smoke
the frame finally crashes splashing into the molten lava
chattar lals body explodes inot flame friefly his flesh is broiled off in an instant we glimpse a skeleton momentarily and then all is consumed and obliterated by the blazing
scramble over to short round who jumps off the platform and they follow him across the altar
indy sees mola ram quickly collecting the sacred sankara stones
indiana rushes over and spins mola ram around he slugs the high priest in the face and mola ram keels over backwards against the statue of kali
short round helps stuff the sankara stones into indianas shoulder bag
short round willie and indiana rush across the chamber behind the altar
they run over to the ladder and start climbing down into the mines
willie follows short round
indiana jumps down last and pulls the ladder away letting it crash to the floor so they wont be followed
they draw the attention of the slave children working in the tun nels around the cavern
but its the sight of the approaching guard that worries indy come on quick
they duck into one of the tunnels
as they hide indy watches the guard passing
whatre we going to do
indiana looks around at the silent frightened children whove stopped working in the tunnel and his anger darkens were going to get them out of here
then he looks at the bag holding the sankara stones and grows still more determined indiana contd and then were going to get these out of here
seething and somehow im going to see this place destroyed
a gaurd passing hears a voice and stops ah sir
excuse me the guard turns and looks amazed to see indy smiling at him from the mouth of the tunnel
indiana contd listen im from the union and id like to talk about the working conditions here
could you step inside a minute
indy smiles again and disappears into the tunnel
in astonished rage the guard draws his sword and goes after indy into the tun nel theres a pause and then we hear the guard yell
willie flattens against the wall as indiana catapaults the big guard past her back into the mine where hes set upon bu a horde of rebellious slave children
the kids swarm over the guard like jackalas and we see short round pull a key from the struggling guards robe
a key is twisted and the chains are pulled from kids legs
elsewhere more chains are unlocked and rattle free
liberated kids spill out of the tunnels
a guard is tripped and attacked by a horde of ex slaves
in another location kids wrap captured guards in layers of chains
high up on a ledge a fleeing gaurd skids to a stop when he sees kids charging at him
he sees more kids rushing from behind him
the guard scrams as he dives off the ledge
freed children scramble up numerous ladders to escape the mines below
they follow the mass of children moving toward the front altar
on the altar under the statue of kali willie and short round are helping indy and some of the bigger children rip down a long wooden panel decorated with hideous
the childrens escape is blocked by the chasm separating the altar from the deserted sorshippers area of the temple
the swelling crowds of children push and teeter dangerously on the edge of the fire pit
indiana and the others carry the wooden panel through the crowd toward the chasm
they stand it up and when indy gives thw word they drop it the panel crashes across the chasm forming a plank across which the children now begin running to
the last of the children scramble up the ladders and run toward the front of the altar
the childrens bare feet stomp across the wooden plank below them the lava of the fire pit bubbles and shows outbursts of flame
indy stares at the plank and sees that its starting to smoke from the intese heat rising up
on the far side of the plank the children safely across scatter through the deserted temple toward freedom
willie and short round help the last kids out onto the plank indy sees one childs foot break though the smoldering wood the kid in front pulls the child to
willie and short round start to go out onto the plank but indy shouts at them no wait
he runs over and pulls them aside he steps out onto the plank and takes a few steps to test it suddenly the plank bursts into flame in the middle
indy takes one more step and then the plank breaks
indy dives back to the ledge of the altar and willie and short round grab him and pull him up and the wooden plank plummets into the fiery chasm
whatre we going to do
theres got to be another way out
indiana willie and short round run through the deserted mine tunnels
they hear a rumbling noise and indy leads them down a side tunnel
they stop and peer into a quarry
a large cavern is the depository for the mine cars rolling in with loads of rock
emaciated children still unaware of the re volt and the other childrens escape break their backs shoving the heavily loaded mine cars
thuggee guards supervise the deadening work while others oper ate the pulley and hoist system used to drag the cars up the sloped dump ramp
behind this operation a thunderous waterfall cascades into a huge cistern
from there chutes deply the rushing water to power the large conveyor belt below it
as the cars rise up the ramp they tip and spill rocks onto the conveyor belt which carries them toward an awesome stone cylinder that rolls relentlessly crushing the rocks
from the side tunnel indiana watches the noisy operation
those empty cars have got to go out of the mines
willie and short round watch the children push the empty mine cars
the cars gain momentum and roll away down two dark tun nels
indiana contd come on lets see if we can catch a ride
tey duck out of the tunnel and run for cover behind a slag heap
loaded mine cars roaring down from the mines hurtle past them and crash to a stop against the cars in front
indiana contd okay shorty go
he pushes short round who darts out after a mine car roars past and dodges across the tracks before the next one descends
indy pushes willie into position and holds her ready i cant
after another car crashes past indy shoves her
willie runs out her shoe gets stuck and she freezes in the tracks
willie sees a rock filled car blasting down out of a tunnel directly toward her
indiana dives knocking willie safely to the ground on the other side of the tracks the heavy car hurtles past and crashes into the cars in front
indy pulls willie behind a massive wooden post holding up the dump ramp and they hide from a passing gaurd
weve got to get across to the empty cars
wait here until i signal you
they watch him run and hurdle a pile of lumber bound up three steps and duck behind a tool shack on the platform
indy reaches out and grabs one of the passing slave children
they see indy put his hand over the kids mouth and whisper to him
he releases the kid who sneaks away alerting the other children who start making their escapes into side tunnels
now indy motions to short rounds and willie to follow
as they start to move out they freeze dead in their tracks and indy motions again angrily come on
willie and short round see a guard coming up the steps on the other side of the platform
as the man rises he gets taller and taller until they see its a thuggee giant coming up behind indiana
indiana contd come one whats wrong
indiana turns and looks into the bare chest of the seven foot tall guard
indy has to look up to see the mans mean looking face
i see the problem
indiana suddenly punches the giant in the stomach the giant does not flinch he just belches rudely
indiana growls and winds up to take a killer swing he steps back cocks his arm and suddenly turns and runs away
no dummy indy dashes over and picks up a piece of wood
the giant starts toward him
indy drops the wood and looks around for a much larger piece of wood
as the giant stalks toward him indiana raises the large piece of lumber indy suddenly groans drops the wood and clutches his stomach
willie and short round looks startled what happened
short round shakes his head
they see indy recover from the spasm as the giant rushes him
indy jumps aside landing on a loaded mine car that is passing by
the car is being dragged up the dump ramp and the giant jumps out onto it after indiana
indy quickly grabs a rock and as the giant rushes him indy smashes the rock against the big mans skull
unfortunately its the rock that shatters and not the skull
indy dives to the other end of the mine car and lifts a large boulder
suddenly indy drops the boulder and grabs him arm feeling a shooting pain again
then he yells as he feels yet another stab bing pain in his left leg
whats wrong with him
shorty is convused and worried and then he sees something
he looks up and there on a rock cut balcony over the cavern is the little maharajah
the little prince clutches the clay krtya doll that represents indy
he jabs it in the leg with a long sapphire tipped turban pin
on the mine car indy yells and grabs his right leg which collapses beneath him
short round takes off
he dashes under the platform toward a bucket chain carrying spent water back up to the cistern
short round leaps over the pool of water and grabs onto a bucket
he rises up on this make shift elevator toward the rock balcony and the malicious little maharajah
meanwhile indy is on the brink of unconsciousness as the giants massive hands throttle his neck
indys head hangs over the end of the mine car and suddenly his eyes widen the car with indy and the giant reaches the peak of the dump ramp and
its upended spilling both of them and a shower of rocks down the conveyor belt
down below willie dodges wooden pillars and weaves around quarry equipment trying to follow indys battle with the giant
she trips and swears angrily willie pushes and empty mine car out of her way an empty mine car
she runs back and starts shoving the mine car along the rails toward the conveyor belt
i got one
indy i got one
near the waterfall short round ascends on the rising bucket chain
up on the balcony the little maharajah chuckles evilly as he watches indiana on the conveyor belt the maharajah lifts the clay doll and viciously jabs the pin in the
back of it
on te conveyor indiana gets to his feet and then yells as a stabbing pain lacerates his back
he falls and writhed helpless ly as the giant staggers up the rocky conveyor belt toward him
willie shoves the mine car forward
she sees indys desperate situation as hes pulled along the conveyor toward the rock crusher
indy look out
she looks up and sees short round leap from the bucket chain onto the balcony
the little maharajahs eyes glow fiendishly as he lifts the clay doll and jabs the pin into the dolls face
on the conveyor belt indy yells agonizingly and clutches his stabbed face
behind him rocks explode as theyre crushed and pulverized by the mammoth roller
in front of indy the thuggee giant grabs a pick axe as the con veyor slides past a tool bin
the giant approaches indy with it
short round dashes across the balcny and tackles the maharajah
they fall and fight like mortal enemies
short round sees the little maharajahs eyes glowing as he punches him in the face
only a few feet away from the rock smashing roller indy is still on his back on the conveyor belt thrashing in pain feeling the maharajahs pin piercing his face
the giant raises the pick axe above his head and it about to split indiana in two
on the balcony the maharajah drops the doll and short round dives for it he grabs the clay doll and pulls out the pin
on the conveyor belt indiana is suddenly released from the and looks up to see the giant swinging the pick axe
indy rolls aside at the last minute
the pick axe cleaves into the conveyor belt and the giant lurches forward indy gives him a helpful kick sending the giant flying toward the rock crusher as indy jumps
off the conveyor belt
seeing the huge roller looming in front of him the giant crawls desperately against the movement of the conveyor belt but he gets snagged
the sash around his waist gets caught under the rolling cursher and hes dragged back under it feet first
the thuggee giant screams hideously as his body is rolled over and squashed by the enormous stone wheel
on the balcony short round is jabbing the pin into the squirming little maharajah
the little pricnes eyes still glow yellow as he hollers how you like bing pin cushion mr
rajah ha ha
the little prince rolls on the ground and tries to fight off short round who keeps jabbing him suddenly the maharajah swings and the pin is accidentally rammed clear through
shorty sees the pin sticking through both sides of the kids hand
the maharajah stares at his pierced hand gasping in astonishment
short round notices the yellow glow dying out of the maharajahs eyes just as indys eyes cleared after he was released from kalis trance
please pull it out
short round yanks the pin out of the little princes hand
the maharajah looks like hes jsut awakened from a bag dream
it was the black sleep of kali
they made me do evil things
may lord krishna forgive me
meanwhile indy runs along the catwalk above the conveyor belt
he jumps and grabs onto a cross bard he kicks out with his feet and knocks a quarry guard off the catwalk
the guard flies through the air and topples into the sand pit where he thrashes around blindly under the sand falling from the crusher
across the cavern willie shoves the rolling mine car toward the balcony
get down here shorty
i got us a ride
willie shirls as another quarry guard rushes toward her
she yanks the iron brake handle off the mine car and holds it threat eningly like a baseball bat willie contd come on lets see hoe hand your head is
up on the rock balcony short round lowers himself over the edge
the little maharajah grabs his arm please listen to go out you must take the left tunnel
shorty looks at him and he knows hes telling the truth
im going to try to find the english soldiers
short round slips over the edge and slides down a wet stalactite to the floor of the cavern
there he finds willie swinging the brake handle and smashing the guard in the gut
the man doubles in pain willie kicks his putt and he splashes into the pool of water
i dont appreciate being cooked like a french fry
willie come on
willie starts pushing the empty mine car with short round
short round contd you do pretty good for a girl
across the quarry mola ram and six temple guards run out onto a high platform next to the waterfall
mola ram sees willie and short round pushing the mine cat
mola ram shouts to his men two of them pull pistols and open fire
bullets ricochet off the mine car and short round shoves willie to the far side of the car where they both take cover
meanwhile up on a catwalk a guard slices a sword through the air and indiana ducks
the sword slashes into a wooden railing and the guard tries frantically to pull it out indiana slams kis knee up into the guards stomach and then smashes his fist
down on his neck the man collapses
indy hears more gunfire
indiana rushes along the catwalk toward the platform above
he edges against the wall below the platform staying out of sight as he unfurls his whip
one of mola rams guards fires again from the high platform and indiana lashes the whip the whip wraps around the gunmans arm and indy yanks on it the gunman
topples through the air and crashes down onto the cat walk
indy grabs the gun
he kicks the guard off the catwalk and the man falls into the waterfall pool
as the other guards fire down at him indiana dodges along the catwalk and fires back at them
a bullet explodes near mola ram and he ducks back meanwhile short round and willie have the mine car rolling and they jump into it indy
indiana spots the rolling mine car racing across the quarry
indy takes off and runs along the catwalk bullets explode around him splintering wood
indy reaches the end of the catwalk suddenly he dives into the air and catches hold of a block and tacke
indy skids along the pulley system sliding down a cable toward the mine car in which short round and willie are riding
bullets whiz past as indiana sails in the air above the speeding mine car when they are in sync indy lets go and drops into the mine car next to
willie and short round
mola ram rushes forward and watches the speeding mine car rolling down the track toward the tunnels theyve stolen the sankara stones they must be stopped
in the speeding mine car indy sees the tracks separating in two directions one back into the quarry the other toward two tun nels that lead out of the mines
indiana lifts a shovel from the floor of the car and swings it just in time he hits a switch which clangs as they speed by and the car is
shunted tipsy turvy onto the track toward the two tunnels
willie hangs on as the car tears down the track toward the tunnel on the right and short round looks worried no indy its left tunnel
but its too late and they all hold on as the mine car shoots donw into the darkness of the echoing tunnel
the wind rushes past indiana as the car descends into the tunnel and picks up speed
willie hangs on with short round the mine car roars around a curve and flies fater along the rails
back in the quarry mola ram supervises the guards as they shove empty cars toward the tunnel
carrying long khyber rifles they jump aboard the cars
the first one rolls into the dark tunnel and the second car speeds after it
the two thuggee cars shoot past descending into the darkness in pursuit of the infidels who stole the sankara stones
the mine car hurtles past
indy sits in front pulling back on the brake lever to control their speed and keep them from careen ing off the tracks
expecting trouble short round peers over the back end of the car
willie ducks low watching the heavy beams flashing danger ously close above their heads
then willies eyes go wide and she groans in terror like a girl on a roller coaster as the mine car suddenly plunges downward taking their stomachs with it
a gunshot rings out and short round sees the first thuggee car appear around a curve behind them
mola rams gunmen start blasting
bullets ricochet off the mine car and indy yells back to short round
come here and take the brake
short round scurries forward and grabs the brake from indy
indiana contd slow on the curves or well fly off the tracks
read you loud and clear indy
short round grins as he holds the brake willie realized that this is shortys idea of a good time
up in the quarry gunmen push a third car toward the tunnel but mola ram stops them
he shouts and they turn and look instead toward the waterfall and huge cistern
indiana is crouched in the back of the zooming mine bar blasting away with the pistol he captured in the quarry
a gunman in the car behind returns his fire the explosions lighting up the tunnle walls
indy aims and fires again the gunman is hit and knocked back in the car
another guard with a khyber rifle moves up to the front and starts firing
meanwhile as the car goes into a hard turn short round rides the brake beneath the car we see the brake pad scraping on the metal wheel
the tunnel gets lower and indy has to duck under each beam flying over and can only pop up to fire between the low beams
the rifleman in the car behind is relading
then he lifts his rifle indy pops up simultaneously and shoots
the gunman is hit his rifle flies up and his head smashes against the beam hurtling above
screaming horribly the gunman is knocked from the speeding car like a broken doll
up in the quarry mola rams men swing sledge hammers bashing away at the rock supports under the huge water filled cistern
indiana runs out of bullets
he sees the car behind getting closer
he tosses the pistol and hits a thuggee in the head
another thuggee retrieves indys pistol and starts reloading it
suddenly indy is being shot at by his own gun and he yells to short round let up on the brake
indy shoves past willie and takes the brake level from shorty
let her go
our only chance is outrunning them
what above the curves
short round looks scared as indy released the brake and the car hurtles toward a curve
they grab the sides of the car as it tips precariously
behind them the curve throws the gunmen from side to side in the car following
indy look out
a sharper curve looms ahead and indy shoves the brake completely off
whatre you doing
were going too fast
willie closes her eyes as they rocket toward the curve
in the car behind the thugge guard at the brake also shoves the brake off and looks extremely worried
indys car hits the curve and the centrifugal force lifts the in side wheels off the rails
get over on the other side
willie and short round jumps over to his side as the car whips around the curve
indy looks back and sees the car pursuing them is also taking the curve at full speed suddenly the thuggee car swereves dangerously the weight shifts too much to the
outside and the car derails
the car bounces off the tracks and flies through the air into a siding where is crashes against a stone wall in an explosion of rock and metal
pieces of debris pommel the drive of the second thuggee car and he quickly grabs for the brake to slow down and avoid the same fate
in the lead car indy smiles smugly as willie opens her eyes
one down one to go
mola rams guards continue to bash away with sledge hammers at the rock supports under the mammoth cistern
one of the supports starts to crumble from above we see the cistern list to one side and water laps dangerously over the edge as the huge tank creaks and
indiana and short round heft a railroad tie out of th bottom of the car and willie watches them lift it onto the back as gunfire continues to explode from
the car behind them indiana and short round shove the railroad tie off the back of the car the wooden railroad tie falls and bounces back across the tracks
the gunmen in the car behind spit it and yell in panic indy and willie watch the car behind crash into the railroad tie but the tie just skids catches
and bounces up and out of the way like a huge tumbling matchstick
yeah this time youre gonna help
the sledgehammers continue until two of the rock supports give way
there are shouts as the guards run for cover
mola ram stands on a platform watching the huge cistern slowly keel over the noise is incredible as the colossal tank crashes to the ground
suddenly a half million gallons of water explode across the cav cern and surge in a tidal wave toward the tunnels
the walls of the tunnel flash past and curves appear suddenly out of the darkness as the hair raising chase continues short round and willie struggle to help indy lift
a large boulder from the bottom of the speeding mine car
the cars descend again into a stretch of much lower tunnel where the beams flash past inches above them
indy judges the beams okay one two now
all three of them groan as they raise the boulder and shove it off the back of the car ducking instantly to avoid being de capitated by the next beam
looking back they see the gunmen pop up between the beams and they see the looks of terror on the gunmens faces as they see the boulder in front of
the thuggee car hits the boulder and upends
the guards scream horribly as the car tumbles end over end slamming against the tunnel walls getting ripped to shreds so that finally only pieces of metal wheels and debris
fly like a meteorite shower down the tunnel
willie whoops for joy and hugs indy who smiles modestly okay shorty hit the brakes
short round dives for the front of the car and ahppily pulls the brake lever it doesnt work
short round yanks on it harder the brake level suddenly breaks off
indy sees short round holding up the broken brake lever
indy crawls quickly toward shorty while willie holds on for dear life
completely out of control the car hurtles down a decline into a section where the tunnel if larger again indiana bends over the front of the car and looks underneath
he sees the brake tension hanging loose from the brake pad
indiana pulls himself back up and looks at willie and short round
grab onto me im going to try and slow us down from underneath
willie looks terrified but helps short round grab onto indys arm and the back of his jacket
he skips over the front of the car and swings a leg underneath indy is inches above the rails and the rocky ground blurring be neath the car as he
tries to kick at the brake pad
his feet fall and he bumps along dragged dangerously for a moment indy manages to find a foothold on the undercarriage of the car
as they hold onto him indy kicks again and his foot hits the brake pad
he shoves it and slowly the pad closes against the spinning wheel
willie and short round look up and see that the tunnel is ending ahead and the track dead ends into a stone wall
he looks around and sees the car rocketing directly toward the stone wall
indys foot starts kicking in high gear underneath the car he slams at the brake pad with all his strength the pad screeches against the spinning wheeel and starts sparking
the car seems to slow as it shoots toward the end of the tunnel
indy groans and pushes hard against the smoking brake pad
the car slows more and more until it runs down the last few yards to the dead end and rolls gently to a stop just nudgeing indys back against the
willie looks faint as indiana gets to his feet and shorty jumps out of the car
they help willie out and she stands shakily im okay im fine i love to flirt with death
indiana sees that the tunnel ahead continues without any more tracks
then they hear something a strange rumbling sound echoing down the tunnel from behind them
the walls seem to reverberate
looking worried they start walking away down the tunnel
they walk faster as the noise behind them becomes louder and they keep glancing over their shoulders whats that
indiana isnt sure and he pulls willie by the arm and all three of them start jogging
the rumbling behind them sounds increasingly ominous and finally they start running full tilt
they rush down the tunnel and the awful noise becomes defening
willie looks around again and slows suddenly willie stops dead in her tracks paralyzed awestruck willie sees a monster wall of water released from the quarry as it thunders around
a curver a mammoth tidal wave crashing spec tacularly against the opposite tunnel wall
a veritable tsunami caroming off the tunnel wall and spewing furiously forward like a hydrous juggernaut
frozen in her tracks oh
indiana and short round notice that willies sloed and they stop running they also see the cataclysm of water crashing down the tunnel toward them
indy runs back and grabs willie
all three of them take off running faster than theyve ever run in their lives
the tidal wave smashes forward booming behind them and indiana realizes quickly that theyre going to lose this race
suddenly he sees a small side tunnel in a bend ahead there
they lunge toward the hole and short round dives in it first
indiana shoves willie into the hole and jumps in after her just as the colossal tidal wave explodes past
the small tunnel drops precipitously and they slide down shower ed by the small side current of water thats broken off from the main force
they rolls and tumble out of the small chute into a larger tunnel
the roar of the tidal wave sounds distant and receding as they catch their breath
lucky i found a short cut
look theres a light at the end of the tunnel
suddenly an explosion
they turn and see the thundering tidal wave crashing around a curve and cascading down the tunnel behind them again
some short cut
they all holler in unison and start running like bats out of hell toward the daylight
the towering wall of water surges relent lessley after them the tidal wave looms up to annihilate them as they race to the mouth of the tunnel and willie screams
indy grabs her and all three of the flail their arms to keep from losing their bal ance
the tunnel exits midway up a cliff and the three totter precari ously on the brink looking down at a foot sheer drop to a gorge below
indiana swings willie onto a narrow ledge on one side and pushes short round after her he jumps himself to the other side just as the tidal wave crashes past
the water bursts out of the tunnel the gusher spews forth from the cliffside into the air as if hoover dam just broke lose
short round and willie balance on the narrow ledge on one side of the geyser indy is perches on the ledge on the other side of the incredible eruption of
willie gets vertigo looking down into the gorge where the water crashes at the bottom
there crocodiles are disturbed and slither angrily
indy looks up and sees a rope bridge swinging about twenty feet above willie and short round
indy shouts across the blasting water willie the bridge
climb up to the bridge
willie looks frightened
nothing to it follow me
he edges along the narrow ledge toward the bridge and willie follows him
once under the bridge they start climbing up the rocks to it
meanwhile indiana is scaling the cliff face to get over the water geyser to the other side
he grabs at scrub brush and finds a few perilous footholds as he makes his way to the bridge
willie and short round pull themselves up at the end of the bridge
behind them a dark tunnel runs back into the mines
whats in front of them is hardly more reassuring the rope bridge across the gorge is a century old and defintely wasnt built by army engineers
laying across the two bottom rope spans worm eaten and moldy boards offer risky footings
vertical side ropes connect the bottom rope spans to the two up per ropes that constitute the dangerous hand railings
short round steps tentatively out onto the bridge
it holds him and he turns and smiles at willie easy like pie
suddenly the board under him breaks
willie grabs short round before he falls into the abyss
looking pale and less cocky short round starts out again and willie follows his carefully
they continue stepping across the bridge cautiously a feat made more difficult by the bridges constant swaying and the hear stopping up and down movement
behind them indy finally pulls himself up from under the bridge
he stands up and sees willie and short round halfway across already
then he hears something and turns quickly he takes his whip out and ducks to the side of the tunnel as two thuggee guards rush out
indy cracks the whip catching the first guard around the neck the guard spills forward and trips the second guard
the first man tries to stand but indiana kicks him in the head
the second guard gets to his feet and seings his sword indy ducks slams him in the stomach and dives for the first guards sword
he grabs it and rolls aside quickly as the second gaurd attempts to slice him in two
indy gets to his feet and immediately finds himself about to en gage in a sword duel with the enraged thuggee guard
indy looks at the unfamiliar sword hefts it and tries to quickly decide the best way to use it suddenly the guard shouts and charges
indy decides shouting must be the de rigueur technique and shouts back loudly the two swords clang and spark as the duel erupts
indy flails and feints and the thuggee guard lunges and slashes
indy finally gains the upper hand and dispatches the thuggee guard who slumps defeated into the dirt
keeping the sword indy starts out onto the bridge walking as quickly as possible across the rickety span
he hears shouting ahead and looks worried then temple guards appear at the far end of the bridge
the guards suprise willie and shorty as they finally get across the bridge
struggling futilely with the guards willie shouts at indiana indy looks out behind you
indy sees more thuggee guards rushing out of the tunnel behind him
he turns and sees two of the tmeple guards who captured willie and short round coming across the bridge in front of him
indy stands helpless in the middle of the swaying bridge with guards approaching from both sides and nothing but heaven above and the rocky gorge hundreds of feet below
a wind comes up and the high priest mola ram appears on the far end of the bridge
he stands with the guards who hold willie and short round
the wind whips around indy and he staggers unsteadily on the swaying bridge as he watches mola ram let my friends go
mola ram shouts in hindi and the guards start to move toward indy from both sides of the bridge
indiana contd thats far enough
you are in no position to give orders dr
indiana indicates the bag over his shoulder you want the stones let them go and call off your guards
mola ram motions and the guards move farther out on both sides of the bridge suddenly indiana swings the sword and it cuts into one of the bottom rope spans
the rope is half severed and frays slowly under the tension
but i dont believe you would kill yourself
mola ram motions again the his guards looking more nervous now step farther out onto the bridge mvoing closer to indy from both sides
indy swings the sword again cutting into the other rope span
it too is now partially severed and frays slowly
the bridge jolts and indy and the guards sway precariously
suddenly mola ram shoves short round out onto the bridge
the high priest draws a dagger and pushes willie onto the swaying span holding the knife behind them both
mola ram contd your friends will die with you
in different times this would be called a mexican stand off indiana looks at the guards in front and behind him
he sees willie and short round out on the bridge now with mola ram at their backs
then i guess were all going to take a big dive
indy and short rounds eyes meet and the kid realizes that his hero isnt kidding
willie looks at shout round anxiously she notices that shorty is surreptitiously wrapping his foot around a rope support
petrified willie also secretly wraps her foot around a rope and does likewise with her arm give me the stones
mola ram youre about to meet kali in hell
indiana swings the sword with all his might it whooshes through the air and slashes clear through the top and bottom ropes
immediately mola rams guards start to flee in panic too late
indiana swings the sword again and the two ropes on the other side are severed the rope bridge is sheared in two
it breaks in the middle and both halves fall apart
the guards scream horribly in the air as they plunge down into the rocky gorge
willie and short round cling to their established footholds and fall with the bridge toward the wall of the gorge
mola ram spills forward clutching desperately at the ropes and slats below them indiana has latched onto a rope and swings with the bridge as it hits the gorge wall
and hangs vertically now dang ling from its moorings at the top
theres an instant of suspended animation as all who remain alive realize they are alive
short round and willie cling near the top of the now vertical bridge
below them mola ram clutches onto one of the main ropes while directly above him the last of his guards holds on for dear life
short round and willie struggle upwards clutching ropes and stepping on slats
finally short round heaves himself up onto solid ground and turns to help willie up
meanwhile dangling below on the bridge indy reaches up and grabs mola rams leg
the high priest kicks and tries to break indys grip
he kicks again and smashes indy in the face
indy wont let go
suddenly the high priest reaches up and grabs his own thuggee guard and yanks his down by the front of his shirt mola ram shoves the luckless guard down onto
indy trying to dislodge him by sacrificing the screaming thuggee
indy manages to hang on
the thuggee is less fortunate and falls screaming to his death
then mola ram looks across the gorge and yells
indy sees a dozen of the last thuggee guards streaming out of the tunnel only to be stranded on the far side of the now bridgeless gorge
indy starts climbing up after mola ram again
he grabs at the back of mola rams robe and pull him down
slipping mola ram turns and its indys chance to punch mola ram in the face
mola rams eyes are glowing yellow and hes shouting incoherent ly
he grabs the strap of indys shoulder bag and stamps on in dys hand indy falls
indiana slips downward scrambling to catch hols of something meanwhile mola ram now has the bag with the sankara stones
indy finally stops his downward slide and dangles dangerously near the bottom of the bridge
across the gorge the thuggee guards run up a path to a small gove of trees growing on a plateau above the gorge
the guards have bows and arrows and take firing positions at the top of the bridge mola ram keeps climbing until rocks start poundinghim from above willie and short round
pely him with rocks which he tries to block with his arm
indiana starts to climb again using all his strength
he reaches for a wooden slat suddenly a flaming arrow smashes into the wood
indy turns in amazement and sees more flaming arrows rocketing across the chasm directy for him
across the gorge by the grove of trees a thuggee priest yells orders to the archers who continue to launch the flaming arrows
indiana crawls up as the bridge starts to burn from the continu ing bursts of fiery arrows
at the top mola ram reaches up des perately for a hand old willie smashes his hand with a rock
the high priest yells in pain and slips down to where indy slugs him again in the face
they struggle as the fire burns up from beneath them
on the cliff above the fallen bridge willie watches the fire rising toward indy and mola ram as they fight
short round turns and sees something willie look
they see horses galloping through a narrow pass the british cavalry is returning
captain blumburtt and the first troops draw up their forses and dismount quickly
a fussilade of flaming arrows force the british to take cover they quickly start firing back at the thuggees with rifles
as the battle above the gorge continues indy and mola ram fight below on the dangling bridge indiana sees the high priests eyes begin glowing and he hisses insanely
mola rams hand thrusts out toward indianas chest and indy yells in pain indy looks down and writhes terrified as he sees mola rams hand starting to enter his chest
as it entered the victims chest during the temple sacrifice
mola rams finger are inching into indys body indy clutches at mola rams piercing hand trying to keep the deadly fingers away from his heart
slowly indy is able to push mola rams hand away and his fingers withdraw from indys chest
indiana suddenly slugs the high priest in the face and grabs for the bag of sankara stones no the stones are mine
youre betrayed shiva
he re peats in sanskrit sankaras warn ing as indy pronounces the magical words the bag begins glowing and starts to burn mola ram as he clutches it the stones
begin to spill out of the bag and the high priest grabs from them
indiana contd he repeats sankaras warning in sanskrit the blazing stones sear mola rams flesh and he screams in pain
the light suddenly dies in his eyes and for one instant he looks at indy as if awakened from a nightmare mola ram loses his balance and indy grabs for
he manages to clutch only one of them as mola ram screams and falls
indy sees the stone in his hand suddenly cool
he watches mola ram plummeting downward into the chasm and finally crashing into the jagged rocks at the bottom
the irritated crocodiles are disturbed once more but soon wel come the meal that just dropped in
jaws flash and teeth rip at the high priests likeless corpse
and indys bag with the sankara stones sinks into the murkly cur rent and disappears down the river
indiana crawls up the burning bridge and willie and short round reach for him at the top
they pull him up onto the cliff and they all look around exhausted across the gorge more british troops emerge from the mine tun nels to subdue the remaining thuggee
guards on that side
finally the little maharajah comes out of the dark mine tunnel
he sees short round across the gorge and bows to thank him for his help
on the other side short round waves his cap saluting him back
willie stands at the edge of the gorge looking down into the riv er far below
i guess mola ram got what he wanted
she sees indy reach into his pocket
he pulls something out slowly as she watches he reveals a crystal stone indiana contd the last sankara stone
short round watches willie take it carefully from indiana
she gazes at it and looks delighted and the diamond hidden inside
willie holds the stone up to the sun and it sparkles and flashes the sun flares and silhouettes three figures coming over a hilltop
behinf them we see more smaller silhouettes appearing over the rise
indiana willie and short round walk back down the dirt road into mayapore followed by a multitude of children returning to their homeland
willie looks at the changed landscape and seems astonished the barren countryside has been reborn
they see streams flowing beneath green trees flowers blooming and peasants harvesting golden grain in the fields
indiana willie and short round lead the children down the village road
ahead they see villagers rebuilding their primi tive dwellings
now they hear shouts of joy from the peasants
the children returning home start running to meet their parents who are rush ing out to greet them
there is laughter and tears as families are reunited
indiana sees the old shaman approaching with the chieftain and the village elders
the shaman touches his fingers to his forehead and bows
the three travelers return his greeting and the shaman is quite moved as he speaks to indiana we know you are coming back indicating the countryside when life returns to
its a real miracle
now you see the magic of the rock you bring back
the old shaman smiles wisely at indiana
indy takes the stone out of his bag and unwraps it
yes ive seen its power willie watches the shaman take it reverently and bow to them
the shaman joins the elders and they walk to the villages small sacred mound
indy and willie stay back
they see him kneel and replace the stone in its niche
the last sankara stone
and they dont even know what it really is
smiling at her well you didnt get your prince and there goes your diamond
you didnt do so well yourself
finding that stone couldve got ten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about
its still a long way to delhi
who knows what might happen
she looks at him like hes crazy
oh no im finding a native guide who knows the way
no more de tours for me thank you dr
she turns and starts walking away continuing to complain willie contd if you think im going to delhi or anyplace else with you after all the trouble youve gotten me
suddenly the bullwhip cracks and wraps around her waist
star tled willie looks angry as indiana reels her in pulling her to ward him and into his arms
but when he finally kisses her she doesnt seem to mind at all
short round shakes his head but looks sort of pleased
when he turns away his face lights up
short round runs toward the sunset toward the three elephants being brought back to the village
the baby elephant starts walking faster as if he recognizes short round running out to meet him
