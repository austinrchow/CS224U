written by hal hartley a garbage truck roars by and
simon grim hangs from the back of it
he is a shy skinny and terrified looking guy around thirty years old
the truck rumbles to a halt and simon climbs down off it to go punch out at the time clock
he comes walking up a small alley and sits to drink his beer
he begins to relax
this is his quality private time
then he hears something and looks up
he peeks up over the edge of some junked kitchen appliances and sees
two teenage kids warren and amy smoking crack and having sex
simon looks on intrigued as warren smokes then
to amy you want some
amy takes the pipe and smokes as he feels her up
simon is fascinated
he drinks and looks on as
amy grins up foolishly at warren and lowers the pipe
the boy undoes his belt and hikes up the girls skirt
simon cant believe this
he looks around to see if the coast is clear then returns just in time to see
warren takes amy by the waist and enter her
the pipe falls from the young girls hand
warren throws his head back and grinds himself into her
simons mouth falls open in awe
but amy tosses her head back to the side and sees
the amazed garbage man caught
amy starts screaming insanely
simon runs for his life
amy and warren throw rocks and bottles at him as they chase him away
simon runs up and throws open the screen door
he stands there in the doorway catching his breath
his sister fay is at the kitchen table watching a small portable tv while their mother mary sits a few feet away in the living room watching another tv tuned
to a different channel
to simon where the hell have you been
to mary mom come on and eat
im not hungry
pissed then whyd i cook
mary is a manic depressive still in her bathrobe at six in the evening
i dont know why you cooked
i dont know why you bother
fay holds her head in her hands and sighs
she glares at her brother
sit down and eat simon
simon sits at the table and fay slams down before him a bowl of some sort of gruel
he hesitates then lifts his spoon
supper is horrible and he screws up his face in disgust
fay gives him a sideways glance and he leans back down over the bowl and eats some more
pushing the bowl away gently he reaches out for the container of milk on the table and drinks straight from it
he suddenly jumps back and spits out sour milk all over the table
the container drops to the floor and thick globs of cheese roll out
he stands back against the fridge holding his stomach while
fay and mary look on in disgust
simon crosses the lawn and sits on the curb outside his house
he stares at the ground before him as he holds his stomach and spits sickened
he looks up though and sees
a little seven year old girl pearl age seven standing there in the street watching him
simon tries to smile at her
but she throws a rock at him and hits him in the head
he falls forward hurt as the little girl runs away
lowering his hand he sees hes bleeding
desperate lonely and ill he drags his bloodied fingers across the coarse pavement
fay slams out of the side door of the house in a tight fitting dress and stands on the lawn applying lipstick
god i wanna get fucked
fay snaps shut her compact straightens her skirt and sighs
simon loses track of what he is hearing and relaxes
he looks back at his sister
fay fluffs out her hair and walks off
see ya later
simon watches her go but is still drawn to something he seems to hear up the street in the other direction
he cocks his head sits perfectly still and listens
he hears it now
we do too
like a giant somewhere in the distance
the neighborhood trembles
simon tries to figure out where its coming from the sky the house the highway at the end of his block
finally he focuses on
the blacktop right before him smeared with his own blood
he kneels out slowly into the street and stares at the pavement
he stretches out his hand and places it flat on the road
the pounding is louder now becoming the beat of the music over the scene
simon lowers his face to the pavement closes his eyes and
puts his ear right down against the road
the steady tread of somebody very much larger than life
kneeling forward with his ear to the ground simon opens his eyes and sees
a man approaching
the music swells up full
simon lifts his head slowly from the road looking off in wonder at
this stranger coming towards him an oddly handsome freak striding over the crest of the distant intersection with a windswept mane two over stuffed suitcases and a crumpled tie fluttering
back over his broad but crooked shoulders
simon rises till hes kneeling up straight in the road
henry fool finally reaches him and stops
simon says nothing and watches as henry looks off at the house
satisfied but wary henry fool looks around the neighborhood and then down at simon
get up off your knees
he tosses the suitcases down in front of simon and walks off towards his new home
henry comes around behind the house and finds the door to his basement apartment
simon follows carrying the suitcases
the door is wrenched open and henry is hit square in the jaw by a decade of dank airless gloom
entering he finds a few old wooden chairs littering the main room
he inspects the old wood stove then takes a chair and smashes it
he tosses the wood in the stove
simon looks on amazed
henry lights a fire with unusually quick results then stands back and looks at simon
where you gotta go to get a six pack of beer around here
this is a convenience store with a number of tables at which to eat donuts
warren is shoplifting while amy terrorizes gnoc deng the vietnamese cashier who stares out at them from behind the safety of the counter
calling shes mute
she dont you know talk
amy looks back at gnoc snarls then follows the cashiers gaze to the door
clutching henrys cash he stops dead in his tracks when he sees
warren and amy
he steps forward and approaches the beer cooler
warren and amy hover around just out of reach like a couple of vampires
dragging a six pack out of the cooler simon crosses to the counter
warren and amy hang back silent and threatening
gnoc rings up the purchase and glances over at
amy staring a hole into the side of simons skull
gnoc hands simon back his change and he makes for the door but
warren shoves himself between it and simon
warren is expressionless
simon looks back at amy
she turns away reaches up under her skirt jerks down her panties then leans forward on to the counter
leering back over her shoulder she hisses
kiss my ass
simon is nonplussed
gnoc presses a button on the wall that sets
a red light flashing above the stockroom door
warren grabs simon by the neck and drags him over to amys bare behind
amy laughs as simon is forced to his knees and has his face shoved up right into the crack of her ass
simon throws up all over her
warren falls back in disgust
gnoc covers her face with her hands
amy looks around at herself realizes and starts screaming bloody murder
simon falls back on to the floor clutching his stomach as amy staggers around with her vomit strewn underwear down around her ankles
then gnocs father mr deng appears at the stockroom door holding a shovel and ready to fight
scared oh shit
mr deng comes running at them and warren drags amy from the store
simon crawls out of the way as the old man throws open the door to the parking lot and screams at the retreating delinquents
in vietnamese stay the hell out of my store you good for nothing punks
having scared them off he comes back in and starts screaming at simon
look at this
whats going on here
simon get up off the floor
is this beer paid for
simon splashes water over his face at the kitchen sink then watches as henry unpacks one of his suitcases
it is filled with dozens of old worn notebooks
henry stacks them on the mantelpiece over the fireplace the fire is now crackling and bright
simon steps over and looks at
the name tag on the other suitcase henry fool
off screen centuries ago it had an e at the end
simon looks over and sees
henrys silhouette against the fire
he steps forward into the light and grabs a beer from the six pack on the floor
he hands one to simon
simon takes it and stares at it a moment before raising his eyes to henry
where do you come from
nowhere in particular
he winks at simon then struts around the room hugely impressed with himself
i go where i will and i do what i must
stops drinks thats why im in trouble
im sortve what you might call
why are you in trouble
stopping an honest man is always in trouble simon
simon comes away from the fire watching him carefully
henry stands in a dim corner across the room
how do you know my name
henry pauses looks aside drinks then grins demoniacally
he steps forward and comes face to face with simon
he lifts his finger and points to
simons name stitched upon the breast of his work shirt
realizing this simon moves off and thinks
henry throws more wood on the fire glancing back over his shoulder laughing mischievously
stopping him i am not retarded
ill take your word for that
he tries to articulate what he thinks he feels but winds up gesticulating curiously with his hands
this finally dissolves into a dumb stare into empty space
simon looks at him
henry stands and grabs a notebook from off the mantelpiece
he tears out a few pages and shoves them in his pocket
he hands the now fresh writing tablet to simon
he searches his pockets and finds a pencil
keep them with you at all times
you ever feel like you got something to say and you cant get it out stop and write it down
simon hesitates then accepts the gifts
henry goes for another beer while his new friend studies the dozens of notebooks on the mantelpiece
what are these
proudly returning this
this is my lifes work
carefully what have you done
henry drinks and looks down into the raging fire
wistfully ive been bad
shrugs and steps away but why brag
the details of my exploits are only a pretext for a far more expansive consideration of general truths
contemplating the notebooks what is this
its a philosophy
a politics if you will
a literature of protest
a novel of ideas
a pornographic magazine of truly comic book proportions
it is in the end whatever the hell i want it to be
and when im through with it its gunna blow a hole this wide straight through the worlds own idea of itself
simon is impressed
they hear a bottle smash outside in the street and henry goes to the window
theyre throwing bottles at the house
throwing down his cigarette come on lets go break their arms
simon jumps up
simon looks away and sits back down
pauses if im quiet
he is ashamed of himself
henry sees this and settles down
he considers his new friend with genuine care as he gets himself a new cigarette
he lights up thinks then grabs another chair and sits close by simon
they sit there in silence a while then
i forget where i was
central america maybe
dangerous location and water so foul the natives wouldnt even piss in it
this crowd of drunken motherfuckers hired by the local drug cartel shows up at my hotel room and threatens to tear me limb from limb
and i say listen hombres ok youve got me outnumbered four to one and youre gunna kill me here tonight and not a soul in this dimly lit world is
ever gunna notice im gone
but one of you
one of you
one of you is gunna have his eye torn out
i repeat myself
one of you poor underpaid jerks is gunna have an eye ripped out of its socket
its a small thing perhaps all things considered
but i will succeed
because its the only thing i have left to do in this world
so why dont you just take a good look at one another one last time and think it over for a few minutes more
smokes waits they sober up a little look at their shoes in confusion then step out into the hall to talk among themselves
henry stares into the flames and falls silent
simon is riveted
he leans forward on the edge of his seat
winking well here i am still after all
later that night
simon climbs the stairs and stops when he hears raunchy sex from his sisters room
he stands outside her door and listens
off did you throw up all over some girl
simon looks up the hall and sees his mother in her room sitting on the edge of her bed smoking
he approaches and stands in her doorway
they were throwing bottles at the house
simon says nothing
he looks down at his feet
gesturing to fays room shes got some ex con in there she met at the bar
tattoos all over himself and a big red bloated nose
did you take your pills
now she says nothing
she smokes and looks away
simon steps into the bathroom and gets her medication
he runs a glass of water and brings it in to her
she swallows the pills and washes them back with water
you want me to tell her to be quiet
she looks away unconcerned and cynical
whats the use
she might as well get it while she can
shes not always gunna have the ass she has now you know
thats just how life is
she throws the blanket over herself and turns off the light
simon stands there in the dark
simon comes downstairs into the quiet dark kitchen and sits at the table
he listens to the traffic on the highway and stares off into space
finally he takes the notebook henry gave him from his pocket and places it before him
but then he just gazes off into the dim living room and scratches his head
returning his attention to the notebook he digs down into his pocket and retrieves his short stub of pencil
he opens the notebook and carefully flattens back the cover
lifting the pencil he pauses and stares at the blank page
then after more intense hesitation he brings the pencils dull tip to the very top left edge of the page and begins writing in a slow laborious hand
the next morning
henry barges in the kitchen door with two containers of coffee and some jelly donuts
simon jumps up from where he sits asleep over his notebook at the table
good morning simon
glorious day huh
here have a donut
can you lend me twenty dollars
simon rubs the sleep from his eyes blinks disoriented and reaches for his wallet
wheres the library in the scruffy little burgh
handing him cash down the highway about a mile and a half and then make a left
im polishing up the final chapters of my confession and i need a reasonably well stocked reference section
he lifts up simons notebook
simon hesitates shyly
i wanted to
he gives up sighs and gazes at the floor
henry flips through the book impressed
it is full from cover to cover every page dense with simons cryptic scrawl
henry frowns intrigued
can i take this
simon looks up terrified
but his friend puts him at ease
ill correct the spelling
later that day
simon finds a number of volumes of the classics while crushing garbage
simon sits with his evening beer and his new collection of soiled classics
he cracks open a volume of shakespeare and tries to read
its an obvious struggle
he puts it aside and lifts up wordsworth studying its cover and the texture of the pages
a page flutters away and he climbs down to the edge of a greasy puddle to retrieve it
its now wet and torn so he flattens it out on the concrete and tries to fit it back into the book
he reads a little furrowing his brow then drinks
he bites his lip and tries again
he sits back exhausted and thinks
he hears a twig snap and looks back over his shoulder to see
amy throws a bottle at his head
he falls to the ground blood streaming down his neck
warren runs over and grabs him by the shirt lifting him out of the puddle and smacking him in the head
amy runs forward and waits with a rolled up newspaper which she sets aflame with her lighter
warren punches simon in the stomach and throws him to the ground then unzips his fly and pisses on him
amy watches giggling excitedly waving the flaming torch
simon crawls away and grabs hold of an old section of fence while warren zips up and grabs the fire from amy
simon pulls himself to his knees rests his face against the rusted fence and gasps for breath
warren waves the flaming torch in his face
weakly unheard one of you is gunna lose an eye
amy comes nearer with a can of gasoline
simon pulls himself to his feet as she splashes him with fuel
warren is waving the torch deliriously above his head
screaming one of you is gunna lose an eye
amy steps back and lowers the gas can
simon turns with effort to face them adjusts his glasses and continues
one of you
warren watches him blankly then is burned by the torch which is too hot to handle
he drops it
amy giggles then stops excited but confused
simon grips the rusted chainlink so that it cuts into his hands and stares straight at warren
you can set me on fire
but one of you is gunna have an eye torn out of your head
warren is transfixed
he shivers and looks at amy who steps back scared and puts down the gas can
she turns and walks away
warren looks back at simon troubled
he hangs there still glaring at him
further away warren rejoins amy and stares at his hands
amy looks ill
take me home
henry is at one of the tables correcting the spelling in simons notebook when he looks up and sees
simon stumble in beaten and bruised dropping his classics to the floor
henry and mr deng rush over to him
who did this to you
i was gunna tear out their eyes
i knew i could do it
i told them
like you said
i told them
and i knew i could do it
he passes out
henry looks at mr deng
you should take him home
he smells like a toilet
henry nods agreeing then lifts simon off the floor
mr deng holds the door open as henry carries his friend out into the parking lot
meanwhile gnoc gathers up the classics from the floor and places them beside simons notebook where it still sits open on the table
she looks at it then reads
she lifts it off the table and reads further immediately and deeply engrossed
mr deng watches as henry departs with simon then comes back into the store and stops startled when he sees
gnoc sitting there staring off into space the notebook open in her hands before her singing quietly
twenty minutes later
fay is in the bathroom helping simon out of his clothes trying to clean his wounds
calling shit mom we gotta get him to a hospital
oh shut up
henry is at the kitchen table with mary
she watches him suspiciously
he lets her
this kinda thing has happened before
standing it wont happen again
she watches him as he walks around the room browsing
how do you know
he stops and lifts a small framed photo of a soldier off the piano
this your husband
violated somehow she gets up and snatches it out of his hands
she puts it in a drawer and cringes as henry plays one note on the piano
he fixes her with a steady knowing stare which causes her to gather the collar of her bathrobe up around her neck
she steps back exposed when theres a knock at the door
they look over to see
mr deng enter with the notebook
nods to mary then mr fool what is this
are you sure
henry comes over takes the notebook from him and shoves it in his pocket
of course im sure
i corrected the spelling myself
it made my daughter sing
yeah well you know thats what poetry does
but she has never spoken in her life
meanwhile back in the bathroom
let me do it
fed up fine
you do it simon
i dont care
she storms out to the top of the stairs cocks her hip and whines
simons got a broken rib his shoulders dislocated or something and he wont let me disinfect the gash in his head
fay just take him to the hospital will ya
stamping her foot but he wont go
screaming simon grim you go to the hospital with fay right now do hear me
simon reaches out and slams the bathroom door
fay looks from the bathroom door down the stairs to mary
mary her nerves rattled glances over at mr deng who turns and leaves the house
henry lights a fresh cigarette loosens his tie and heads upstairs
a moment later
henry throws open the door and enters
he steps over simon who is on the floor folded up against the toilet
we gotta talk
henry sits on the edge of the bathtub and takes the notebook from his pocket
what the hell were you trying to do when you wrote this thing
simon just looks at him not certain what he means
well you know you wrote it in a kind of iambic pentameter
he scratches his chin and smokes
look in my opinion this is pretty powerful stuff
though your spelling is neanderthal and your reasoning a little naive your instincts are profound
but the whole thing needs to be given a more cohesive shape
it can be expanded
smokes then you see what im getting at
simon just stares at him overwhelmed
henry drops the notebook on the floor and points at it with his cigarette
are you willing to commit yourself to this
to really work on it
to give it its due
in the face of adversity and discouragement
to rise to the challenge you yourself have set
simon just blinks looks away and wonders
and dont gimme that wonderstruck im only a humble garbage man bullshit either
it hurts to breathe
nodding of course it does
simon coughs and henry leans back and smokes
an hour later
fay cringes outside simons room as henry goes about setting her brothers arm
are you sure thats right
now shut up and lie back
is this gunna hurt
he pauses then leans back
you gunna be alright
simon nods and stares at the ceiling
henry hands him a towel
bite on this
spots blood on it whats that
looking its blood
from your head
shove that in your mouth and hold on to something
simon bites down on the towel and grips the edge of the bed with his free hand
henry sits on his legs and gently raises the broken arm
outside the door fay bites her knuckles
further down the hall mary listens from her bedroom
henry grabs hold of the arm swallows and braces himself
simon waits then henry tugs the arm straight
fay turns and runs down the stairs
mary backs away into her room and shuts the door
later that night
henry comes downstairs and stops tired
fay is sitting at the table with a bottle of gin and two glasses
she has dolled herself up a little and henry likes what he sees
he looks her over and she smiles
so do you have like you know a girlfriend henry
they drink again in silence
he lights her cigarette and they watch each other closely
finally fay leans on the table and twirls a strand of her hair between her fingers
do you find me attractive
yes i do
i look young for my age dont i
how old are you
how old do you think i am
you look young
playfully how young
i dont know
i mean do i look more like twenty or
you know thirty
he drinks and studies her
she presents her profile
finally he leans back
fay jumps up furious
listen you geek after a couple of drinks plenty of people mistake me for eighteen
she grabs her bag and storms out of the house
henry watches her go then chuckles deviously and splashes himself another drink
a thirty year old cocktail waitress named vicky walks up and stops when she sees
warren sitting back against the side of world of donuts smoking a joint and thinking about his future
she sighs and approaches
hey warren are you a registered voter
bug off vicky
unruffled she hands him a flyer
reading saving america from itself
what the fuck is this
its everything you need to know about the upcoming elections and congressman owen feer and all the really good things he wants to do for our country
he tokes deeply then
oh yeah like what
he wants to win back this country for us americans warren and restore some kind of cultural moral standard to our way of life
warren looks over the flyer then reconsiders vicky
what times your kid go off to school
carefully nine oclock
how about i come over and visit you later
vicky sighs troubled
she adjusts her waitress uniform and looks mildly offended
well i dont know warren
warren gets up too
i mean it
im trying to change
vicky is hard pressed
she wants to believe him but knows better
she thinks about it while
henry passes by and approaches the store
henry enters and takes simons notebook from his pocket
he flips through a few pages and selects one in particular
he tears it out of the book and tapes it up beside the register so customers can read it
he winks at gnoc
she smiles shyly and makes him a coffee
he takes it and moves off to a table just as
she starts accumulating groceries placing them on the counter one item at a time
henry settles down and watches as
vicky returns to the counter with a bottle of orange juice and notices the poem
she reads holding the orange juice out to her side
gnoc starts to ring up the other purchases as her father comes up behind her busying himself with an inventory of the cigarettes
vickys lip starts to tremble as she reads a horrified expression clouding her face
she drops the bottle of orange juice and stands back
mr deng and gnoc jump back alarmed
henry tilts his head and pays close attention
screaming at mr deng how dare you put something like this up where anyone can see it
mr deng looks from her to the poem and then over at henry
henry urges the man to stand up for himself
to vicky its poetry
the product of a diseased mind
you oughta be ashamed of yourself mr deng
it made gnoc sing
pauses confused its disgusting
there oughta be a law or something
she grabs her things and leaves
mr deng holds his head and looks over at henry
winking theres no accounting for taste is there mr deng
mr deng has no idea
he sits worried as gnoc comes out from behind the counter and begins mopping up the mess
henry is at the kitchen table with simon working on the poem
simon is bandaged up his arm in a sling black eyes etc
see simon there are three kinds of there
t h e r e
there are the donuts
then theres t h e i r which is the possessive
it is their donut
then finally theres theyre
t h e y r e
a contraction meaning they are
theyre the donut people
henry lifts up one of simons newly acquired classics
and look if youre gunna read wordsworth youve gotta get a more up to date edition
this odoriferous tome youre so attached to doesnt even have all fourteen books of the prelude
and you need notes
ill go to the library and find you the best edition they have
thank you but thats ok
ill stop there on my way back from work
well yes maybe not today but you know tomorrow probably
you need time to write simon
but i like my job
we all have to make sacrifices
a vocation like ours simon is not a nine to five thing
you cant put a fence around a mans soul
we think and feel where and when we can think and feel
we are the servants of our muse and we toil where she commands
simon looks past him and henry follows his gaze to find
mary standing at the foot of the stairs listening to them
she says nothing
she looks henry up and down then shakes her head disdainfully and grunts
she throws herself on the couch and turns on the tv casting acid glances over at the kitchen
henry and simon come outside
shes clinically depressed
yeah and whats that mean
thinking then i guess it means its not her fault
henry wanders out to the road checking his wallet then
sighing you ever think of leaving
to go where
you know into the world
simon looks off thinks it over and slowly nods
yeah i guess
reciting opportunity will step away and make room for a man to pass it by
is that from your book
i found it in a fortune cookie
he pulls the tiny piece of crumpled advice out from one of his pockets and shows it to simon
can i read your confession
is it almost finished
puffing himself up well you know simon a piece of work like this its
a vocation like ours
you cant put a fence around a mans soul
what im trying to achieve its
well it takes a lifetime really
its a lifes work
looking around but soon
id appreciate your feedback
i gotta go
he hurries away around the corner
simon walks back to the house and stops when he sees
a plain clothes policeman officer bunuel drive up and park before the house
simon spies as the man gets out of his car and knocks on henrys door
he of course gets no answer
later that day
simon works on his poem at the kitchen table while fay flips through a magazine and watches tv
mary lying on the couch in her bathrobe watches her own tv
the cacophony is augmented by the rattling dishwasher and the trucks rumbling by on the highway outside
mary looks over at her son suspicious and leans off the couch
what are you doing there simon
he carefully finishes writing a word then looks up and pauses
im writing a poem
mary looks at fay who looks up from her magazine and considers her brother
then they break out laughing
simon looks on
they laugh and laugh and laugh
simon is bent over his notebook consulting a dictionary hard at work
amy and three kids are grouped around the register reading the page henry taped up earlier
as they read amy glances anxiously back at simon
they finish reading and stand back
it aint so great
to amy of simon that him
amy nods yes then leads them towards simon
simon scribbles away
off pardon me simon
he looks up sees her panics and slides away on the seat
amy looks down and bites her lip contrite
im the editor of the high school newspaper now and
one of the editors
one of the editors and we
wanted to know if we could print your poem in this months issue
simon looks around at them all threatened
because i think its great
to pat who cares what you think
youre a drag
a well known drag
to simon please
simon fumbles with his pencil ill at ease and self conscious
then to get rid of them he nods his consent
fay comes downstairs in only a towel and wet hair
she switches on the tv and looks for cigarettes
she finds marys pills on the table and remembers to ask
ma you take your medication
mary is lying on the couch
she drags her eyes from the tv and glances lazily at fay then back to the tv
to herself guess so
she sits at the kitchen table and lifts her magazine
henry shows up at the kitchen door with a pile of library books
his eyes brighten when he sees
fay sitting there wearing only her towel
she looks back over her shoulder and sees him
disdainfully what do you want
ive got these books for simon
she turns away
well leave em there on the counter then
he comes in and stacks the books near the sink
fay pretends to ignore him but rakes her fingers through her wet hair anyway to show more shoulder
this is not lost on henry who tarries and leans back against the counter salivating
fay flips through her magazine and henry steps closer and leans against the fridge
she casts a bored glance in his direction then returns her attention to the tv
she senses him step aside and follows his movements without turning
suddenly his hand appears from behind her and gently strokes her hair
she freezes waits wonders
he leans his face down beside her
she looks at him
he looks at her then down to
her bare legs crossed before her on the kitchen chair
his hand moves down and slides itself deep in between her things
her mouth drops open
he looks back up at her
fay jumps up and away breathlessly clutching the towel around herself
henry casts a glance over her body throws his hair back out of his face and shivers with lust
fay steps back and grabs hold of the staircase banister making an unconvincing gesture of injured pride
henry comes closer and she steps backwards up the stairs
he stops loosens his tie holding her with his gaze
she readjusts her towel throws back her wet hair sighs defiantly then sashays into her room leaving the door ajar
henry waits there at the foot of the stairs reaches down grabs his crotch and repositions his hard on
he takes a step up the stairs then stops
he looks over to the couch and sees
mary lying there sedately amazed
he pauses then grins
mary blinks and smiles sleepily
simon sits back from his writing and rubs his neck
putting down his pencil he looks up and sees
warren enter the store and grab a beer from the cooler
seeing simon he waves and approaches
hey simon you a registered voter
simon hesitates but then nods uncertainly
warren hands him a flyer
this year when you go to the polls i want you to consider congressman owen feer
he wants to restore america to its position of unmatched wealth power and opportunity to revitalize american civilization and lead the human race to even greater levels of freedom prosperity
hes a good man
he steps over to the register and pays for his beer
mr deng glares at him distrustfully
warren stops on his way out and snarls at the old man
simon looks down and studies the flyer
fay lies across her bed in her towel holding a pose and glancing anxiously back at the door
finally losing her patience she gets up
where is he
she opens the door and looks out into the hall
hes not there
she steps out into the hall and listens
she comes to the top of the stairs and hears faint activity from down below
she proceeds downstairs
she sees no one in the kitchen then looks in the living room and stops
she goes white her mouth falling open in horror
henry and mary are screwing one another on the couch
sloppy impassioned brute sex
they fall away from each other in terror and fatigue
mary clutches wildly at her bathrobe as henry falls over the coffee table stumbles to his feet and pulls up his trousers
fay is crushed
she breaks out in tears and runs upstairs
henry catches his breath and starts after her but stops uncertain and confused
simon is asleep with his head down on the table
he wakes finally and sees
henry sitting across from him gripping a beer and reading the poem
he finishes shuts the book and drinks
i know a man
hes a big shot in the publishing business
smart adventurous and tons of integrity
when this thing is ready ill recommend he reads it
hell respect my opinion
simon takes this in then looks down at his hands and proceeds carefully
a man was here today looking for you
alert what man
i dont know
he drove by the house a few times
henry throws his eyes heavenward and pulls his hair
jumping to his feet he paces maniacally
why do they torment me like this
theyre like a bunch of fucking mosquitoes
a customer a few tables away gets nervous and leaves
what do they want from you
they want to suffocate me simon
they wanna extinguish me like a flame
some kid named tim sitting at another table turns around and asks
theyre afraid thats why
theyre afraid of what i might do
what i might say
theyre afraid of my ideas
he drinks then returns and sits beside simon
you and i are alike in this way simon
we think and feel too much and too deeply
and the world cant handle that
our mere existence is a threat to its illusion of security
sure theyll name a wing of a new library after us when were dead
now when were alive
now they wanna burn us at the stake
he drinks burps then slams down the can
he glances over at tim who is still looking on
tim hesitates but then obeys
he gets up and leaves
henry returns to simon
for example i made love to your mother about half an hour ago and now im beginning to think that maybe it wasnt such a good idea
i mean to say i think fay may be jealous
simon is deeply confused
he looks ill
he stands and takes a few steps away staring at the floor
i dont want to think about this
bad move simon
simon stops and looks at him
pointing at him a poet has got to be able to think about anything
simon pauses then comes closer to henry and stops
am i really a poet
henry jumps up strides around the store and speaks at the top of his voice
of course you are
a great poet
but you need experience
you need to do something to be ashamed of every once in a while for cryin out loud
he walks to the door
lets go out
theres a den of iniquity right across the street
you got any money
he strides out of the store
simon stands there stunned and looks at mr deng as the old man wipes off the table with a wet rag
later that night
henry is dancing wildly on the bar with two sloppy drunk topless dancers
the place is rocking and the crowd cheers them on
simon sits perched on a stool gripping the bar with white knuckles and clutching a beer looking on in terror as
henry starts stripping
later that night
simon stumbles in and heads upstairs
but he stops seeing
mary sitting on the top step smoking
she looks guilty and tense
so does simon
that mans a bad influence
she gets up and storms into her room
simon comes upstairs and stops outside his bedroom door when he sees
fay passed out drunk on her bed
her clothes are half off and her lipstick smeared
she still grips a bottle of tequila in her hand
simon hesitates but then goes in and removes her shoes
he gets her out of her jacket and rolls her into the bed
her bare limbs have their effect on simon and he finds himself staring at her thigh
he reaches out and almost caresses her leg where her hiked up skirt reveals the bottom of her behind
he catches himself snaps his hand away and covers fay with a blanket
simon is alone in the room with his bed
the pale sheets beckon
he is flushed
he creeps down the stairs with an arm load of books
sitting at the table he wrenches a nearby lamp into a more useful position and begins to read
the next morning
henry stumbles up the stoop carrying a laptop computer its various accessories and a couple of coffees
he lets himself in and dumps the computer on the kitchen counter
simon is asleep on the couch still in his clothes
shoving him simon
simon wakes come on
i got ya some coffee
henry trudges back to the kitchen where he whips out his red pen and immediately begins to correct simons poem
simon rolls off the couch and makes his way to the table
seeing the computer
its a computer
you write on it
he reaches into his pocket
heres the manual
simon looks over the computer and flips through the manual
whered you get it
i stole it
remember how yesterday we discussed the relative desirability of cadence in relation to the readability of
off oh shit
not you again
fay is on the stairs hungover and disgusted
henry throws up his hands and gets up to go
simon i cant work under these conditions
get outta here you freak
get a life
eat shit and die henry
mary throws open her bedroom door
oh shut up mom
fay stomps back upstairs
mary slams her door shut
simon runs out after henry
simon follows henry out into the street and over towards world of donuts
henry wait up
i am not a rapist
but henry stops short seeing
officer bunuel enter world of donuts
come on this way
and he runs down the street in the opposite direction
simon hangs back but then follows
they scramble in and henry is out of breath
he slumps down into a pew
keep a look out
tell me when hes gone
simon does but then
henry whats going on
who is that guy
whats he want
he wants to help me
he wants to be my friend
he pats his pockets looking for his smokes
simon looks on baffled
he comes closer
help you with what
he hears something stands and moves further into the church
simon hesitates but then follows
they hear someone crying
finally in a pew off to one side in the shadows they find
a young priest named father hawkes
hes a wreck
he looks up from his quiet sobbing and sees
henry and simon standing there looking on with embarrassed distaste
he lowers his head in shame
henry moves closer and sits beside the distraught priest
the priest sighs hopelessly
henry leans back with a sigh and reaches for his cigarettes
so youre an honest man
why beat yourself up about it
he offers a cigarette to the priest and he accepts
i dont know if there are grounds for faith
is my vocation relevant
does it make a difference
a difference in what
the way it is
is this a way to help relieve suffering
your vocation makes a difference
how can you be so sure
because vocation is the difference
only someone who really cares doubts
listen father as i was about to tell my friend simon here i am without doubt the biggest sinner within a hundred miles of this parish
but still ive gotta stay up late at night to outdo the unending parade of mundane little atrocities i see committed every day right out in the open spaces of
this loud and sunlit culture we call home
you seem to me to be a sensitive and generous man
i like to think so
but the fact is i appreciate depravity
nevertheless i insist your vocation makes a difference because to hold out anything other than a spiritual yardstick to reality is to be jerking off grandly into the abyss
listen have you got any money
lets go have a drink
warren is stopping people on their way in and out of world of donuts
excuse me miss are you a registered voter
oh god really i dont know
well id like to give you some information about congressman owen feer
this man is gunna make a big difference in the lives of every american in the years to come
i gotta go thanks
a man bill steps up
pardon me sir
warren stands back and loosens his tie
he looks over at pearl age seven who is sitting outside the store
what times your mother get off work
she doesnt respond
he shakes his head and approaches
he sees fay exit the store
fay are you a registered voter
stopping dont you dare talk that way to me
and keep your hands off my brother
pearl what are you doing here
im watchin her
fay figures it out and approaches
you and vicky get back together
i gotta regular job now and everything
she lifts a flyer and reads
i saw this retard on tv this morning
hes gunna be the next president of the united states of america fay
keep dreamin warren
the guys a nazi
i like him
gimme a light
lighting her cigarette hes a decent man
he takes complicated issues and totally simplifies them
and i appreciate that
you still sell dope
you know what the problem is with this country fay
im the problem
we live in a culture of poverty and crime where the work ethic is undermined and male responsibility is made irrelevant
she studies him a moment more lost then shakes her head and helps the child off the car
come on pearl lets go play at my house
she gives you any trouble fay you just let me know
an hour later
henry and father hawkes are drinking
simon leans on the bar nodding off to sleep
after a while father hawkes leans back and
do you think human beings are innately bad
worse than bad
but i love that about them
banging on the bar wake up simon
simon falls off his bar stool
warren straightens his tie and looks over to see
simon stagger up
warren shakes his head in dismay and approaches
simon steadies himself against the wall of the building
jesus christ simon youre letting yourself go to hell
you read that flyer i gave you
simon wake up and smell the coffee huh
its up to guys like you and me to help create a better tomorrow
simon is lost
he staggers into world of donuts and heads for the coffee machine but stops when he sees bunuel talking to mr deng
bunuel looks over
their eyes lock
to vicky why would i steal a computer from the campaign office
im not saying you did im just saying one was and since you do have this criminal background
he slaps her
pointing dont judge me
simon runs out of the store and limps away towards home as bunuel storms out in pursuit
simon tries to run but bunuel catches him easily
look i know you know him
people have seen you around together
simon ceases to struggle but shakes himself free and stands looking down at his feet
bunuel stands aside and watches him a moment then reaches in his jacket and brings out his badge
im his parole officer
simon studies the badge and waits a little before asking
what did he do
im not supposed to talk about that stuff with people
bunuel pauses then puts away his badge and looks around the parking lot
mr deng says youre some sort of a poet or something
simon doesnt corroborate this
he looks away and readjusts his sling
bunuel scratches his head satisfied and prepares to leave
you tell henry to call me officer bunuel pronto
or theyre gunna chuck his ass straight back into jail
bunuel waits a moment then steps away and gets back in his car
simon watches as the parole officer drives away and passes
vicky look im sorry
dont you even come near me
what do you mean you quit
i quit my job
there are things i want to do
simon thinks of trying to explain but then decides not to
opportunity will step out of the way to let a man
pass it by
are you drunk
now you have to go out and get a job
i am not gettin a job
paces then whos gunna look after mom
fay looks at the ceiling and sighs
pearl go outside
they wait as the child goes outside
mary listens unseen from her bedroom door
fay comes over and frowns at her brother
shes about to lecture him but he cuts her off
if you treat mom like a sick person shes gunna stay like
you know a sick person
fay tries to control herself
she sighs tiredly and attempts to reason with him
simon dont be retarded
banging the table i am not retarded
fay steps back startled
simon stands but cant decide which way to go
he sits back down
i can see with my own eyes
mary turns away from her door and sits on her bed
fay leans over the stove where a large pot of water is beginning to boil
mom cant be left alone with no one to keep an eye on her
simon is frustrated and lashes out
well whos been keeping an eye on her while youve been out getting fucked by every otb winner in town
fays mouth falls open and she staggers back hurt
simon regrets it already and stands to leave scared
but fay grabs the pot off the stove and hurls it at him splashing boiling water all over his back
outside pearl turns and looks back at the house
simon lies gasping on the floor of the kitchen
fay falls back against the stove terrified and drops her head into her hands
fay is crouched on the floor sobbing while simon lies in a tub of cold water
mary comes in with a pathetic little freezer tray of ice cubes and dumps them into the tub
she steps back into the hall and throws the ice tray down the stairs
she glares back at fay who cries even louder as simon stares up at the ceiling
mary shakes her head and walks into her room slamming the door behind her
sniffling what happened to her simon
how did she get this way
will it happen to me too
why are we so fucked up
simon has no answers
but he reaches out and touches his sisters hand
simon comes limping in all stiff because of his scalded back
hes not familiar with the library so he stands looking around trying to figure it out
he wanders into an aisle overwhelmed by all the books
coming to the far end of the aisle he looks off to his left and sees henry sitting on a small stool reading with ten or twenty open volumes scattered
around him on the floor
looking up and rising simon
what are you doing here
your parole officer officer bunuel came by again today
henry sighs and sits back down
he told me to tell you that if you dont call him theyre gunna put you back in jail
he gave me this number
he was talking to mr deng too and well you know i was thinking
simon just shut the fuck up
simon blinks and looks down at his feet unable to respond
deeply hurt he simply turns to walk away
but henry reaches out and grabs his arm
simon stops pauses and looks back at his friend
he lets go and turns away on his stool
forgive me simon
simon comes back over to him
call him henry
henry gives in slowly to the inevitable
he sighs deeply and stands handing simon a book
look do me a favor
you got a library card
check this out for me
simon looks at the cover paradise lost
you see simon its important my confession dig up the past comb previous evidence and help chart the historic even the aesthetic inevitability of my ideas
a young woman passes by scanning the stacks
she and henry have a split second of eye contact then she turns and moves away
henry straightens his tie and watches her go
this place is crawling with chicks simon
leer a little
cop a feel
impose yourself on em
see what happens
i make girls uncomfortable
youve got a rough hewn charm that sets em on edge
now listen i gotta go
henry stops and turns
simon pauses then
what did you do
henry watches him for a moment then swaggers closer
i got caught
simon waits for more but is disappointed
with one final cracked grin at his friend henry throws back his shoulders slicks back his hair and strides off
simon watches him go and frowns not comforted
he flips through the pages of paradise lost
voice over whereto with speedy words the arch fiend replied fallen cherub to be weak is miserable
he comes out from the stacks working his way through the first page of paradise lost
he nearly bumps into a girl and they stop and look at one another
he tries to hold her gaze for a moment challenging himself but then turns away and stalks to a table
he sits and leans over the page
after a moment though he lifts his face and glances at
another girl sitting further down the table
she looks up from her reading and returns his gaze
he smiles at her
she gets up and leaves
simon frowns confounded and returns to his book
he takes out his notebook and pencil meaning to take notes but sees instead
a third girl sitting at another table listening to her walkman and typing her homework into a laptop computer
he finds himself staring at her and forces himself back to his book
but he cant help himself and glances back over at her
with a sigh he begins to write in his notebook
voice over why is it this beautiful girl makes me sad
does she know how beautiful she is
do people tell her
does she ever feel stupid
he looks back over at her
she happens to look up and their eyes meet
horrified he looks down
why dont i smile when she looks at me
i look away
ashamed of myself
he watches her again thinks then writes
her figure makes me violent
i want to somehow break her
how is this possible
he writes a few moments more scribbling across the page then stops and looks back over at the girl
voice over i cant breathe
he tears out the page and folds it in half
then he gets up and crosses the room to where the girl is busily engaged in her work
she looks up sees him and removes her headset with a pleasant smile
he places his note on the table before her then turns and walks quickly away
the girl watches him go confused then lifts the note and reads
voice over why do i do this to myself
and why do i reduce you to only one possibility
these are not even questions anymore
i know the answers myself
this isnt a page of notes
its a letter
a letter to you
a desperate act
you are a miracle to me
i cant breathe
by now simon is gone from the library
the girl finishes reading the letter and looks around in astonishment
henry enters and sits with bunuel
how are you henry
gimme a light
have you found a job
henry just glares at him and smokes
how bout those alcoholics anonymous meetings did you go over and visit them yet
what happened to this assistant librarian position you were supposed to set me up with
bunuel looks down disappointed
i tried henry
i really did
so what happened
henry with your background
well i mean with your record they didnt think itd be right to have you at the neighborhood library
they thought youd be a bad influence on the kids
henry sits back offended
adds or worse
so my word is not enough
my promise worthless
the fact ive served my time nothing but the emblem of my continuing guilt
henry leans back and sighs furious and indignant
simon comes in excited and preoccupied and finds fay working at the computer
im creating my resume
this computers got a program especially for it
i bought some special stationery too
she shoves a sheath of papers up under his nose and he backs away in disgust
simon takes his notebooks from a cabinet above the fridge
can you type my poem into that thing
shocked thats your poem
smokes then simon moms right about you
a poems supposed to be a small delicate kinda thing
look at this
youve made a fuckin telephone book
he places the notebooks on the table and leaves the house
fay clears the computer screen pulls the notebooks closer and gets down to work
simon arrives with a six pack and finds henry sitting in front of the fire staring into the flames brooding darkly
i was caught
yes i was caught
i was caught in flagranti delicto screwing a thirteen year old girl named susan
she was an ugly and mean spirited kid but she knew how to play upon my weaknesses which i admit are deep and many
he drinks then looks at simon and adds
you appear shocked
he is sorry
henry stands and leans over the fire
it was a pathetic little conspiracy
a transparently desperate attempt to discredit me and my ideas to label me a mere pedophile
as if id be ashamed of such a thing
as if socrates himself hadnt been taken out of circulation for corrupting the youth of athens
he comes over and takes a beer
he strides around the room thinking reflecting
seven years for one afternoon of blissful transgression
but what of it
prisons not so bad particularly if ones a sex offender free from the popular and conventional horror of sodomy
stops drinks declares
they were not lost years
he approaches the notebooks lined up on the mantelpiece
i put them to good use
i began my major work
he glances over at simon who sits gripping his beer watching rapt
believe me simon this incident with the girl prison
it pales to insignificance in the wider context of my career
he pauses and swills back some beer
he brightens up gets excited
nothing in comparison to the day my confession is unleashed
beginning to pace what an orgy well have then huh
what shouts of outrage from the offended populace from the sanctimonious purveyors of culture and quality the righteous defenders of what ever inane and haphazard notion of progress then in
theyll be beside themselves with fiercely reasoned critical analysis
apoplectic with indignation
drinks sloppily burps wipes his mouth with his arm
their feelings will be hurt
he smashes the bottle in the fireplace
yes like a mirror which reflects only the inside of the person before it my confession will lovingly render humanitys common monstrosity in all of its lurid wide screen glory
he grabs a new beer and twists off its cap
why should i blush or feel shame before the common lot of humanity anyway for a few banal and again i admit inelegant transgressions
he drinks sighs and sits back down
after all really im doing civilization a favor
simon sits back in awe
he waits a moment and thinks
finally he stands and approaches the confession
he reaches out and drags his hand across the notebooks
when can i read it
henry sits staring into the flames again
he pauses then
simon and father hawkes are deep in conversation
we are told not to judge
but to forgive
not to look into our neighbors eye to find the bad but to find the good
pacing now this is difficult
pause but having a good friend is not always easy
simon listens and carefully considers all the priest says
do you think henry is
father hawkes pauses then comes closer and sits
he needs help
but what can i do
the best parts of himself come to the surface when hes helping someone learn
ive seen this
let yourself be taught
show your appreciation for his guidance
in this way you know perhaps
theres hope for everyone
fay comes walking up through the parking lot with simons notebooks and a pile of typed papers
shes a wreck tear stained face and a ball of tissues gripped in her hand like a weapon
she throws open the door to the world of donuts and looks around
the place is crowded with teenagers hanging around like it was a cafe or student union
fay sniffles tragically and falls on the counter
gnoc gimme a value pack of kleenex will ya
gnoc gets the kleenex while fay overhears two kids near simons poem
the violence of the imagery reminds me of early clash while the lyricism of the verse recalls for me walt whitman
i would have said dickinson maybe even eliot and so on
but i agree with the punk roots
fay pays for her tissues and makes her way to the back of the store where she finds simon with henry who is holding forth to his friend and the
small coterie of high school students surrounding them
the greats all say the same thing little
and what little there is to be said is immense
or in other words follow your own genius to where it leads without regard for the apparent needs of the world at large which in fact has no needs as
such but rather moments of exhaustion in which it is incapable of prejudice
drinks we can only hope to collide with these moments of unselfconsciousness
this divine fatigue
sitting push over
henry takes the typed manuscript from her and continues
as i tried to make plain in paris nous savons que nous avons chute parce que nous savons qui nous sommes
we know we have fallen because we know who we are
skeptically when were you in paris
interrupted thats beside the point
but did they listen to me
of course not
fay blows her nose and simon is concerned
you alright fay
lighting a cigarette no im not alright
your poem brought my period on a week and half early
so just shut up
everybody just shut up
she drops her head to the table and cries
henry and simon look on in silence
then henry continues
for is this not the best of all possible worlds
are not the evils of this world necessary components of a cosmos that could not exist without them
amys girlfriend chris leans forward studiously and asks
so do you believe in god
smokes shrugs unfortunately
lifting her head yeah but when were you in paris
simon can i have your autograph
simon looks from her to henry
henry winks at him
but never let yourself be flattered
simon signs the girls book
to henry so what about this friend of yours hot shot
reminding him angus james
how about sending this poem to him
henry seems a bit put upon
because its not done yet
to simon whens it gunna be done simon
i dont know
well you oughta be home writing instead of hanging out over here with all your groupies
hey im not a groupie
pardon me swivel hips
is that your powerbook
can i see it
fay and amy talk tech as
continues the thing to do is to send parts of it to different magazines and literary journals first
that kinda thing
looking up whats scatalogical mean
henry sips his beer and looks at her
a preoccupation with excrement
thats what the board of education called simons poem yesterday scatological
henry reaches across the table and shakes simons hand
the next day
fay is frying something on the stove a cigarette hangs from her lip
a middle aged woman with a press id on her lapel appears at the kitchen door and taps
yeah im listening
my name is edna rodriguez and i write the human interest column for the queens county examiner and i was just wondering if i could have a word with simon
intrigued fay steps over to the door with her spatula
she looks edna over studies her id then steps away and screams upstairs
startled thank you
fay comes back over near the door waving her spatula
you cant talk to him for you know too long or anything cause hes gotta you know
he writes all day
thats all he does
can you believe that
calling again hey
get down here
simon finally shuffles into the kitchen
simon this is edna
shes from the newspaper
rapid fire simon the parents association at the local high school are calling your poem pornography
the teachers are defending the students right to exercise their critical tastes and sensibilities
the county agrees with the church and considers the poem emblematic of modern societys moral disintegration
how do you feel about these controversial reactions to your poem
simon says nothing
he just stares at her
punching him simon answer the woman
simon just looks away thinks then wanders back upstairs
mary passes him on his way out of the kitchen and comes up to fay and edna at the door
i need my prescription filled
mom this is edna
mrs grim what was simon like as a child
we all thought he was retarded
never said a word
he masturbated constantly
had no friends
till he met henry
and thats when all the trouble really started
henry is shaving
simon sits in the kitchen sorting through rejection letters
reading dear mr grim we here at the magazine consider ourselves and the publication open minded and cutting edge and have consistently printed the work of the most brilliant and
farseeing young talent of the day
every week we are forced to return writing which we can not for one reason or another publish and include a brief but polite refusal
but this tract youve sent us demands a response as violent as the effect your words have had upon us
keep your day job
sincerely the editors
de gustibus non disputandum est
thinking you cant argue with taste
you cant argue about taste
simon gives up and pushes the letters away beaten
the other twenty five are almost as bad
i dont know why i bother
henry drops his razor and stomps out into the hall
what do you mean you dont know why you bother
you bother because you know the poem is excellent
of course you do
im not so sure sometimes
can you sit there look me straight in the eye and tell me you dont think this poem is great
that it is not at once a work of great lyrical beauty and ethical depth
that it is not a genuine highly individual and profound meditation on the miracle of existence
simon holds the stare overwhelmed
simon looks away thinks a moment then looks back at henry
so you see you have no choice
he goes back into the bathroom
simon thinks a while then
calling can you recommend it to your friend the publisher
can you recommend the poem to him
still no response
simon gets up and stands in the bathroom doorway
henry is shaving
i mean i think its finished and for better or worse it is book length
that might not be as easy as it seems
well its been a long time
my name might not carry as much weight as it once did with angus
but hes your friend right
we were close at one time
you said he respected your opinion
henry puts down his razor and looks at simon in the mirror
look simon opinions come and go
he sees simon looks worried
to be honest my ideas my writing they havent always been received well or even calmly
im a controversial man
he walks around the bathroom gesticulating
you see what im doing is too radical
itll take time for people to see its value
its ahead of its time perhaps or maybe just
stops a recommendation from me might do you as much harm as it does good
simon patiently absorbs all this then walks through the kitchen and looks across at the confession notebooks
henry why cant i read the confession
because certain work needs to be experienced all at once in order for one to appreciate the full force of its character
simon talks with fay as she eats her lunch
simon wake up
the guys in a dream world
hes afraid that his reputation will prevent people from giving my work an honest chance
his reputation as what
as a writer
gimme a break
hes kinda like in exile
marginalized on account of his ideas
if hes such a great big fat genius why doesnt he write books
like you do
hes written a book
its almost completed
hes been working on it for years
its just not published
yeah i bet
its probably disgusting
defensively its a quite serious and difficult piece of work apparently
have you read it
certain work needs to be experienced all at once in order for one to appreciate the full force of its character
yeah well what ever
listen simon forget henry
go straight up to this angus james character yourself and make him read your poem
she gets up to go
shes wearing a smart outfit
im gunna apply for a job at the one hour photo joint and then go over to the mall to see about that job in the bank
make sure mom takes her pills
mary is sitting brooding in front of the tv which displays only static white noise
she turns it off with the remote and sits in silence for a moment
she gets off the couch and moves to the kitchen table where fays computer sits
she goes over and reaches up above the fridge opening the cabinet containing simons notebooks
she hesitates then takes them down and holds them in her hands as if to begin reading
but then she puts them back
she walks over to the piano and stands there hesitating before slowly sitting down and opening it
she lifts her hands to play then pauses and looks around behind her making sure no one is there
but finally she turns back and begins playing
she plays a sad sounding modern classical piece with rusty accomplishment
at one time she was probably quite good
she plays for a while gradually letting herself become moved by the music
but then she stops pauses and looks behind her
simon is standing in the kitchen
he has been deeply affected by her playing
please dont stop
she stares him down a moment longer then looks away and closes the piano
she returns to the couch and switches on the tv
simon comes closer
that was nice what you were playing
yes it was nice
but it was unremarkable
does that matter
looking right at him yes
she gets up off the couch and goes upstairs
she slams her bedroom door and leaves simon alone on the couch
then he gets up and goes into the kitchen
he takes the typed manuscript of his poem from the cabinet above the refrigerator and goes to the door
he pauses clutches the poem and goes out
simon waits clutching his poem to his side as a train pulls into the station
excited and determined he gets on
simon travels to new york city
he finds an envelope on the floor to put the poem in
mary wakes up and sits on the edge of the bed feeling regretful about her tone of voice with simon
mary comes down into the kitchen and listens
she steps over to the cabinet and almost takes down simons notebook
she grabs her pills and is about to take them
but then she stops
she puts them down and goes to the cabinet
she takes down simons notebooks and sits at the table pauses then pulls them closer and begins to read
simon enters a big posh lobby and checks the registry
simon comes out of the elevator and enters the reception area of james midriff and sutton publishing
he walks hesitantly up to the receptionist a bright and spirited young woman named laura
hi ill take that
simon steps back defensively
arent you the messenger
are you here to fix the plumbing
im here to see mr
amused are you
im not a plumber
or a messenger
i was once a garbage man
but now im a poet
laura steps back cocks her head and removes her designer eye wear
angus is at a big table with two other men steve and barry
the book as we know it angus will be a thing of the past within the next few years
novels articles newspapers will all be downloaded on to our personal computers anyway
so youre telling me to get out of the publishing business
but weve got to re invent the publishing business for the electronic age
im sorry to disturb you gentlemen but
angus theres a particularly wound up young garbage man out here who seems to have written a poem
a long poem
and i recall how at last months meeting you stressed the need for us to be on the look out for more marginalized verse from unestablished quarters of the american
did i say that
steve and barry nod
make an appointment laura
sometime next month
right e o
and shes gone
returning so anyway how is the digital revolution going to help me sell books
simon looks disappointed
why cant i see him now
sincerely because hes a very important man and well youre not
simon just looks down at his shoes
laura touches his arm and reassures him
he looks up pauses then
i dont think people are going to prefer reading books on television steve
it wont be television
itll be interactive
angus look we have a number of charts here
in every home in america the pc will be where the tv used to be
and itll be a direct connection to all forms of media
an unprecedented transformation of american social life
well all become better informed more literate increasingly productive and
well and like i said we have a number of charts
laura re enters
sorry to disturb you again gentlemen but
angus id like to call security for this one
though before i do i just wanted to ask just how marginal the as yet undiscovered voice of american poetry should be
thinking pretty damn marginal id think
down right controversial probably
hows he strike you
hes been denounced by his local board of education
oh i read about him in the paper
hangs out in a delicatessen somewhere and writes pornography
angus comes out to the water cooler and glares at simon as he gets a drink
hello and why do you think i should take valuable time out of my busy schedule to read
he grabs the envelope and sees no title
simon is stumped
he looks over at laura who purses her lips and tilts her head
he twists a button on his shirt thinking then returns to angus
because its a masterpiece
to laura are you hearing this
i wouldnt want to waste your time
im sure you wouldnt and i appreciate you being so straightforward
i assume you can take straightforward criticism
simon looks over at laura
just say yes
looking back maybe
get him a coffee laura
have a seat mr grim
hold my calls for the next half hour
what about steve
he doesnt drink coffee
steve do you drink coffee
off angus listen to me
henry paces back and forth
with the fingers of one hand pressed against his forehead and his eyes closed tight in concentration he dictates to amy who is sitting at a table with her laptop
computer typing his every word
in the infinite amplitude of his love god wants to create the largest number of best elements that can exist together in one cosmos
amy types away fascinated by henrys intelligence
in an instantaneous calculation made in eternity god computes the best possible world and creates it
this decision by god is uncontingent and eternal rather than temporally or ontologically sequential
stops zeroing in on his point
how do you spell that
o n t
dont you have some kinda spell check on that thing
it is impossible for every perfect good to be compatible with every other perfect good
the intense beauty of the mountain must be set off by the fertility of the plain so to speak
he smokes drinks paces some more
amy waits with bated breath devastated by his obscure profundity
he comes back and sits beside her reaching his conclusion
the good of freewill must entail real choices for sin
she gazes at his profile in love
henry sits thinking and amy watches him reverently
she leans over close and whispers in his ear
he turns and looks at her alarmed
listen amy back off
im on parole
you feel the same way
i can tell
i can see it when you look at me
henry jumps up and looks around paranoid
he keeps his voice down and points at her
i dont look at you
yes you do
in the street
in the parking lot yesterday
that night on the highway
i look at a lot of people that way
disappointed amy turns away and sulks
you think im stupid
henry sees shes genuinely upset and feels bad
he sits back down and lays his hand on hers
no as a matter of fact i think youre a real bright kid and i like that about you
looks up pouts you do
now henry tries to scare her away
he leers at her
i like it so much ive got half a mind to do perverse things to you
things you might just learn to like
she just stares at him blinks then looks away and tries to imagine this
she takes her laptop and leaves confused and blushing
henry watches her go and grins satisfied with himself
angus throws on his coat and thrusts the poem at simon as they walk down the hall
this is really quite unbelievably bad my friend
i mean im all for experimentation and ive made a career out of a healthy disregard for convention but
look this is profoundly irrelevant material
this is only my opinion
but its an opinion i value highly
call norton press
were still on for tomorrow
simon looks pale as angus strides towards the elevator
ive been wrong before as a publisher
but i refuse to admit ive ever been wrong as a reader
you have talent i admit
you have an innate sense of the musicality of language
a good ear maybe
but you do nothing significant with it
and this twisted reasoning that poses as
conviction or insight its
well its embarrassing
they reach the elevator and stop
simon tries to catch his breath
why did you bring this thing to me anyway
weakly a friend of mine spoke of you
he said you had a lot of integrity
yes well of course i do
but im not crazy am i
who is this person
do i know him
simon hesitates almost decides against it but then
angus looks back at him
angus looks aside thinks then shakes his head
never heard of him
simon just looks at him blankly confused
the doors slide open and angus gets in the elevator
simon sinks into a chair and stares at the carpet
he is so surprised and hurt he gasps for breath
his poem slips from his hand and falls to the floor
off i remember henry
simon doesnt register this right away
but then he looks up and over at the receptionist
laura stands and comes around her desk
she pauses seeing his disappointment then comes closer and picks up his poem
handing it to him she explains
he used to be the janitor here
he just stares at her demolished
simon dumps his poem in a trash can pauses then enters the subway
henry is leaning on the counter flipping through pornographic magazines and smoking
off henry put those magazines back
im just looking at the pictures
its not good for you
henry flips through pages and nods impressed
i learn so much from these magazines mr deng
i refuse to discriminate between modes of knowing
and you cant smoke in here anymore
henry looks up outraged
its the law
henry throws his cigarette to the floor steps on it and returns to his magazine
this place is losing all its charm mr deng
business is good
the kids they hang out all day and drink coffee talk about art and read poetry
henry shakes his head in dismay and studies a centerfold
its just a fad mr deng
these kids today theyre just slaves to fashion
fay comes in hot and tired from walking around in high heels
she stands on the stairs and hears the water running in the bathroom
ma that you
she discovers shes out of cigarettes
henry is leaning on the counter with a six pack of beer pleading with mr deng
come on mr deng
how much do i owe you
twenty five dollars
that cant be right
and so what
my credits good
warren comes in
hey warren you gotta couple of bucks i can borrow
warren reaches for his wallet
listen henry i wanna remind you to vote this thursday
ah yes of course
when noble minds shrink from the task of leadership scoundrels will rush in to fill the void
takes cash thanks
its every americans right
yet another opportunity to save america from itself
henry pays mr deng for his beer
fay bangs on the door
hey henry you in there
gimme a cigarette
she tries the door
she goes quietly in
henry steps out of the store and stops when he sees amy standing there pouting
he looks away and sighs
amy picks at the fabric of her stockings and bites her lip
what kind of
well i mean
what kind of
perverse things would you do to me
its more than he can stand
he holds his head
take a powder cupcake
crushed she breaks out in tears and flees
simon comes in furious and throws open the fridge
he finds nothing to eat or drink
he slams the door then hears the water running in the bathroom upstairs
he stops and listens
the bathroom door the water heard running steadily
simon turns away then sees
the poem notebooks face down on the table
the bathroom door the water heard running
henry comes into his house hot and bothered cradling his six pack
but he stops listens then steps through the kitchen towards the living room
he stops in the entrance and sees
fay on the floor of the living room reading his confession her mouth hung open in an astonished o
he drops his six pack and
she spins around caught in the act
henry stands in the doorway pent up sweating and with perverse things on his mind
fay her hands palm down on the floor behind her bites her lip coquettishly
henry looks her over like she was something good to eat
she feels his gaze all over her and twists to one side with a breathless little shudder
he steps nearer stands over her and she looks up at him
simon climbs the stairs to the bathroom
henry and fay kissing passionately
simon knocks on the bathroom door
henry and fay groping and shoving one another as they stagger from room to room
simon bangs on the bathroom door
fay falls to the couch
simon crashes through the door and finds
mary kneeling over the edge of the tub her wrists slit and the blood running down the drain the shower raining down over her back
simon looks on in horror
henry tears open his trousers
simon lifts mary from the bathtub
henry and fay clutch and grind and heave
simon drags his mother from the bathroom and down the stairs
henry and fay are making mad passionate love oblivious to the world around them
simon drags mary through the house
henry and fay fuck
simon drags mary out the kitchen door and into the yard looking desperately for help
he reaches the street her limp body hanging grotesquely before him and looks helplessly up and down the block
simon henry mr deng fay gnoc and bunuel stand with father hawkes at the grave
let us pray
lord grant that peace be within reach for our friend mary
may the pain and confusion she endured on earth be fought through in the after life so that she may enter the kingdom of heaven and live in the light
he sprinkles holy water on the coffin and they all drop carnations at the grave
simon and fay remain there looking down at the coffin
henry waits for them a few yards away wishing he could help but feeling out of place
simon is back working on the garbage truck
he collects garbage and throws it in the truck as henry who is just along for the ride hangs from the side of the truck and pulls the lever whenever
simon tells him to
so i was a janitor
but angus james said he didnt even know you
henry shrugs and qualifies
well i mean we werent like bosom buddies or anything
but we used to talk sometimes
in the elevator
in the morning
he said he liked my ideas
being a janitors a good job if youre a writer
especially the night shift all that time to think and develop my ideas
henry pulls the lever and the garbage gets crushed
anyway he hated my poem
well what the hell does he know
he wouldnt know a vital piece of literary art if it came up and bit him in the leg
to hell with him
hes not the only publisher in the world
but nobody likes it
smokes its true
a prophet is seldom heeded in his own land
henry is about to pull the lever again but sees something in amongst the garbage
hey look treasure
henry steps down and leans over into the garbage
simon joins him as he lifts something that is either a ring or a stray piece of machinery
what is this
some kinda copper
its a ring
i think its a gasket
a fitting from off of that old refrigerator over there
henry puts it in his pocket satisfied and simon jumps on the back of the truck as it turns the corner and rolls away
henry starts to walk off in the opposite direction but stops when he sees pearl age seven
henry comes up the street with pearl age seven on his back
he walks into vickys yard and finds warren lifting weights in the garage
hey warren i found pearl wandering around by the garbage dump
he sits up on the bench and takes a toke off the joint he has waiting
well you know
somebodys gotta lose
whats the fucking use
you make sacrifices
you try to be a decent human being
try to contribute something meaningful to society
and what happens
they lose to a bunch of cultural elite liberal fuck ups
i dont give a shit anymore
people deserve what they get
henry pauses then leads pearl age seven towards the house
warren lies back down and continues his lifting
henry knocks on the door as he enters
he comes in and finds her sitting on the couch with a drink
shes got a black eye
what happened to you
hes a good man henry
i guess not
hes terribly disappointed
i found pearl wandering around with no shoes on her feet
pearl comes over and stands beside her mother
she gets scared
and you dont
vicky caresses pearls hair then drinks and looks over at henry
i love him
bunuel is waiting when henry walks in and steps up to the beer cooler
alarmed wheres the beer
no more beer
cafe au lait
henry looks at the man disgusted then falls in to a seat and motions to gnoc who is now the waitress
a double espresso and a jelly donut gnoc
to bunuel you mind paying
my credits no good here anymore apparently
nods amiably did you go to the employment agency today henry
no but its ok
simons gunna try to get me a job on the garbage truck
listen im a little concerned about your friend
seems he gave an obscene note to a girl in the library
get outta here
im not sure
it couldnt have been simon
it almost certainly is
he mentions you
he unfolds a print out of the letter
henry reads and bunuel leans over pointing out
her figure makes me violent
i want to somehow break her
how is this possible
henry thinks this over gulps back some espresso and nods his approval
bunuel this is obviously a love letter
taking it back weve had complaints
where did you get it
she posted it on the internet
oh the slut
she was trying to warn other girls about a potential rapist
smokes is all this true about the internet
about how you can get pornography on it
well yeah sure
its a big problem
you can send dirty pictures and everything
on the internet
henry is impressed
bunuel gets up to go
see you on thursday henry
calls the waitress gnoc gimme one of these double espressos to go will ya
he is having ideas
fay still dressed in black is tapping away on the keys to the computer surfing the internet as henry appears at the kitchen door gripping his tall double espresso
you gotta get outta the house fay
you cant blame yourself for not being here
you did all you could for her
she turns and glares at him
is there something you want
henry stops pauses looks away
you got the internet on that contraption
resumes typing yeah
he changes the subject again preoccupied and continues tenderly
look fay about you know between us what happened
i dont wanna talk about it henry
he sighs and drinks his coffee then looks back at her
type a part of simons poem onto the internet
come on fay
its a great idea
i dont know if he would want us to do that
sure he would
just the first ten verses
fay is tempted
i dont know
hell thank you for it later
frowning she reconsiders
she gets up and takes the notebooks from the cabinet above the fridge
she flips through the pages but suddenly stops and turns to the door with a nicer attitude
but hes gone
its as if he has vanished into thin air
she sighs sits back down and begins typing the poem onto the internet
henry comes back into the store satisfied with himself
he finishes off his coffee tosses away the cup and takes a pornographic magazine from the rack
he leans on the counter where mr deng is busy working and flips through the pages
gimme another one of those tall double espressos mr deng
mr deng starts to make him one and sees him with the magazine
you gunna buy that
im just looking
well then put it back
theres this fascinating story about a famous rock band and how they tied a friend of theirs to a bed in their hotel room and inserted a live fish into
mr deng shakes his head and frowns
explains they say she had numerous orgasms
henry you need to do something with your life
get a job or something
i mean it wasnt the entire fish it was just you know the nose
the nose of the fish
mr deng brings over the coffee
henry is surprised to notice he is not riveted
you dont find that interesting
henry closes the magazine and puts it back
leaning on the counter he sips his coffee and ponders
you ever wonder what it would be like to have sex with an animal mr deng
that coffee is free
just take it and get out of here
i mean some dogs are almost as big as people and often more attractive
mr deng just goes back to work leaving henry there at the counter thinking big thoughts
simon hangs from the garbage truck as it comes up the street and pauses in front of his house
he jumps down and the truck barrels away
simon taps at the door
she looks over at him and he sees shes been crying
he comes into the room and she sits up on the edge of the bed
did you see him
he came by this afternoon
did you talk
he comes over and sits beside her
he thinks a moment then
youve got to tell him fay
he thinks im a slut
and she starts crying again
simon awkwardly touches her shoulder then moves his hand away
fay pulls herself together sniffles and goes into the bathroom
simon comes downstairs and finds henry at the piano
he looks ill and is clutching a nearly empty container of espresso
he is staring sickly at the ring
simon i dont feel so good
i feel all kinda clammy
simon lifts the coffee container and smells it
how many of these did you have
henry tries to remember
simon puts the container down and sits at the table
henry we have to talk
can i use your toilet
fays taking a shower
henry grabs his stomach
he presses his hand against his chest holds his head then stares at the ring
how much you think i can get for this
he looks at simon
pauses henry fays pregnant
henry looks at him
fays pregnant with your child
henry lets this sink in
he stands and the room tilts
white with fear he clutches at his rumbling gut
fay is in the shower as
henry bursts into the bathroom tearing at his belt and trousers
she starts screaming and wraps herself in the shower curtain
he drops his pants and throws himself on the toilet just in time to begin shitting his brains out
fay crouches terrified and disgusted in the shower
henry sweats and moans as he empties his bowels in a violent and messy blast of noise and foul air
fay covers her face and whimpers sickly
finally hes done
he hangs with his face out over his knees sick exhausted and in shock
fay wraps herself in a towel and steps out of the shower
she creeps carefully around him and flushes the toilet growing increasingly concerned
he is destroyed staring down at
the ring he still holds in his hand
fay sees this looks at henry then kneels and takes it from him
he doesnt resist
she lifts it up and breathlessly admires it
totally misunderstanding moved beyond words
and she throws her arms around him as he sits there sweating and spent on the toilet
a month later
mr deng and bunuel drag henry kicking and screaming into the church foyer
once inside he shakes them off and they stand back
he huffs and puffs and tosses the hair back out of his eyes
he paces back and forth like a caged animal then stops sees
fay at the altar waiting with simon
she is beautiful
henry calms down deeply affected
fay smiles down the aisle at him
henry throws back his shoulders straightens his tie and strides up the aisle
also present at the ceremony are vicky and warren
gnoc is maid of honor
henry holds fays hand and repeats after father hawkes
i henry take you fay to be my wife
i henry take you fay to be my wife
and do promise before god and these witnesses
and do promise before god and these witnesses
to be your loving and faithful husband
to be your loving and faithful husband
in plenty and in want
in plenty and in want
in joy and in sorrow
in joy and in sorrow
in sickness and in health
in sickness and in health
for as long as we both shall live
for as long as we both shall live
the gasket everyone is now mistaking for a ring is lifted high before the altar
bless o lord this ring that he who gives it and she who wears it may abide in your peace and continue in your favor until their lifes end
the gasket is placed on fays finger
whom god has joined let no man separate
the doors of the church swing open with a tremendous creak and everyone turns from the altar to see
she steps in and stands there alarmed clutching a long scroll of fax paper
simon do something
simon walks down the aisle to see to amy
the guests watch and wait
as simon reaches her amy looks away from the altar and shows him the fax scroll
he studies the fax and recognizes his poem
he grows concerned
where did you get this
its all over the internet
simon looks up the aisle at
fay and henry
they look away caught
theyre even talking about it on the tv news
confused simon starts for the door shoving the fax in his pocket
fay steps down from the altar
amy hurries along beside him
theres a guy from the radio station over at world of donuts and a story in the newspaper about some kids burning down a school near boston
later that evening
the whole neighborhood is celebrating fays wedding
the music is loud
the people are drunk
the place is a shambles
a big dance number is playing
amidst all the festivities though simon and bunuel have the small tv propped up on top of the fridge following the evening news
on tv it all started right here in queens jim at world of donuts about one year ago today when local garbage man simon grim put pencil to paper and
began to compose what many have come to regard as vicious antisocial and pornographic poetry lines of unrhymed free meter verse which would one day serve to spark the flames of controversy across the nation and indeed the world
fay leads the neighbors in the dance
on tv this is outrageous
measures must be taken
have we debased our culture to such an extent that a garbage man with a head full of sick ideas is legitimately referred to as a poet and where the
filth he spews can be accessed by any child old enough to turn on a computer
is this what we have come to
not the transmission of our highest ideals but a cynical atheistic delirium
henry and fay dance surrounded by the dancing neighbors
on tv poetry of this kind and this poem in particular is i think a worthy form of desperation a digression on the extremes of human experience of solitude of
it is perhaps alarming even upsetting to some myself included but it must be allowed to exist
henry throws an arm around warren who stands looking dejected in the doorway and raises his glass to the happiness in the room
on tv meanwhile in rome today the pope issued a message of hope for believers in their fight against what he termed the godless and lost
he did not mention simon grim by name but offered a prayer for the young whom he described as sadly in need of faith and not the illusion of conviction
offered by rock music drugs and contemporary poetry
the tv is switched off
its later now
people are passed out on the kitchen floor and various neighbors are sitting around the table
fay steps back from the tv drains a glass of beer and wipes her mouth on the sleeve of her wedding gown
she hugs simon who is deeply unsettled by the news of his growing infamy
god simon i mean like youre a total fucking rock star
a huge crowd of kids are pressed up against the doors trying to get a peek at their hero simon grim
angus comes away from the window
he stands and regards simon who is sitting at a table tearing a napkin to shreds
im willing to negotiate simon
i know its just
youve had other offers
why have you reconsidered
because i think your writing will be tremendously successful
but you dont like it
its growing on me
what made you change your mind
he points to the fans outside
other peoples responses
i dont live in a vacuum you know
two months ago i didnt have the proof of your poems appeal
now i do
simon thinks this over but says nothing
angus comes over and lays his hand on his shoulder
consider my offer carefully
get some professional advice
ill call you tomorrow
angus emerges and has to fight his way through the throng of excited adolescents
he reaches his limo and gets in
but he pauses before closing the door and considers the crowd
simon emerges from the store and kids begin screaming and shouting for autographs
angus shakes his head impressed
simon consults father hawkes
what were the terms
a hundred thousand in cash up front
a seventy thirty split
well that could be better
but it is a hundred thousand dollars up front
you could use that
so its a good deal
of course its good
so i should take it
try to get him up to a hundred and fifty thousand
henry stalks along all fired up
simon tries his best to keep up with him
ive let myself down simon
ive let myself be caught in the bloody maw of banal necessity
how did i get here
how did this happen to me
im going to be somebodys father
i need time to think
time to finish my confession
i cant work for a living
i tried once
my genius will be wasted trying to make ends meet
he collapses extravagantly
this is how great men topple simon
their hearts are in the right place too much of the time
they get sidetracked
how could i have been so careless
henry please let me read the confession
its not done
im all washed up
angus james is convinced my poem is going to make him incredibly wealthy
hell read your book and seriously consider publishing it
if i ask him to
henry glances back at his friend digesting this
he thinks it over then
you really think so
having finally got through to him simon comes forward anxious to help henry
ill insist he publish the confession
he paces back and forth thrusting out his chest for the first time in his life displaying something like pride or arrogance
adds or i wont let him publish my poem
henry sits there watching simon impressed with this evidence of increased self esteem
he realizes the profundity of the gesture
youd do that
youd do that for me
simon stares off into the distance
you saved my life
henry is moved
he stands and comes forward
he grabs his friend by the shoulders and turns him around
do you realize what youre saying
pausing i owe you everything
henry steps away considering then looks back at simon and extends his hand
they shake hands
simon enters comes forward into the room and pauses looking off at
the stack of twelve books that comprise the confession
henry stands outside watching his door
simon lifts the first volume opens it and begins reading
henry paces drinking and smoking nervously
simon strides the length of the living room reading
he stops frowns
simon reads in front of the fire
bunuel hawkes and mr deng sleep sitting up as henry talks to himself
fay leans out the back door and interrupts him
he looks at her but says nothing
she sighs and goes back inside turning off the lights
the next morning
simon sits wearily reading the final page of volume twelve as the morning sun streaks into the room
finally he finishes and slowly closes the book
he stands and crosses the room
leaning against the wall he removes his glasses and rubs his aching eyes
simon steps out of henrys apartment and sees henry asleep on the back stoop
simon stares into a glass of water
fay sits ten feet away waiting
its really that bad
the confession lies on the big desk
angus hand comes down upon it
youve read this
and you want me to consider publishing it
as part of our deal
simon this book its
its really quite bad
thats what you said about my poem
angus pauses and figures
he changes the subject
im offering you a very real expression of my faith in your writing
two hundred thousand dollars and a sixty forty split
but just exactly what is the nature of your faith in my writing
look simon you dont require my admiration
you require my experience as a publisher
and that experience leads me to believe your poem will make more money than any book of poetry ever published
virtually make you a household name within two years
youll never have to work on a garbage truck again i assure you
or do anything else for that matter
whereas this confession by henry fool
he is at a loss for words
the most i can say for this is
the man is a scoundrel
he taught me everything i know
he encouraged all that was expressive in you to become manifest
he inspired you to act
he influenced your perception
simon waits a while staring at his shoes
how about if my advance is only a hundred thousand
its not about money simon
we could split the royalties seventy thirty
i will not publish henry fools confession
simon sits and lets this sink in
angus waits then
will you sign the contract
simon continues looking out at the city
angus waits but there is no response
finally simon turns pauses and slowly crosses the room
he sits at the table and looks down at the contract
fay is in labor
henry helps her into her coat as they rush for the door
henry runs into the store and stands there panicked looking at hawkes bunuel and mr deng
gnoc runs out to get fay
henry and gnoc load fay into the van
the van pulls out
henry drives recklessly
fay rolls around in the back
fay is in a wheelchair being rushed down the hall
she is gripping henrys hand as he runs along beside her
fay gasps and sweats as the doctor and nurse prepare her
she is scared
she looks over at
henry looking in through the window
he looks scared too
fay is sedated by gas
henry is taken away by the nurse
fay stares up at the ceiling
henry is asleep on a row of waiting room chairs exhausted
simon comes running up the hall and finds him
its late and no one is around
he sits down beside henry and shakes him
he sits up and simon sits beside him
coughs its a boy
simon sits back relieved
then he remembers the rain soaked shopping bag he has with him
he pulls out a couple of cans of beer and hands one to henry
they look around seasoned conspirators and make sure the coast is clear
then they pop open the beers and toast
how did it go
simon pauses scared then gets up and crosses the room
he looks out of the window and gathers his strength
listen henry angus james didnt like your confession
henry looks at simon blankly then blinks and looks away
well what now
what do you mean
did he suggest changes
simon comes back and sits again
i mean after all there are things i can do to make it more accessible
i can soften up some of the language and make it read easier
take out some of the more intratextual references and popularize the underlying sturm und drang so to speak
i can change its mode
make it more of a conventional novel instead
simon just stares at him blankly then sighs and shakes his head
laughing oh simon dont be such a purist
i appreciate your protectiveness but the integrity of the work gives it a durability that can sustain such things
simon comes over and lays his hand on henrys shoulder
what are you saying that it doesnt merit revision
angus james didnt like it
he steps away and sits
henry pauses then approaches and leans down over him
well did you tell him what you think
what i think doesnt matter
yes it does
youve got to use your influence with him
i gave it to him to read and he hated it
what more can i do
you can refuse to let him publish your poem
i cant do that
you said you would
that was before i read your book
hit hard oh
looking up at him i signed the contract henry
henry stands there a moment longer then lowers himself into the nearest seat weakened
look henry what did you expect
i dont know
indignantly look if i had told you when at first i read it that i thought it was no good what would you have done
i would have respected your opinion
and insisted that theres no accounting for taste
well is there
simons words catch in his throat
he turns away frustrated
i dont know
i didnt bring it to angus because i thought it was good
i brought it to angus because youre my friend
staggered oh how perfectly enormous of you simon
explodes look henry i did it
i wrote poetry because you told me to
i worked while you sat back and comfortably dismissed the outside world as too shallow stupid and mean to appreciate your ideas
is that such a priority
is that some sort of measure of a mans worth
to drag whats best in him out into the street so every average slob with some pretense to taste can poke it with a stick
sits tired maybe
maybe it is
henry just stares at him stands then turns on his heel and waves him off
you must be pretty impressed with yourself huh
the all too obviously talented new man the important new voice the early clue to a new direction or whatever etc
a popular new trend conveniently packaged for the distracted young herd
you want to be liked more than you know simon grim
youd be nowhere without me and you know it
simon hangs his head destroyed
henry is scared all of a sudden
but he puts on a defiant exterior
its time you left
he stands drinks and walks over to the window
i saw you for what you were in the beginning simon
i hold no grudge and im certain you will in time leave some serious and small dent in this world
weakly the world is full of shit
henry take advantage of simons disillusionment and puts on a big show of secure wisdom
the world is full of shit
and you have to walk through it
thats your part
but youre no good at it
perhaps im not
perhaps i wasnt made to walk through shit
go on now
do what youre good at
simon sits there a moment numb with grief
henry red in the face stares at the floor
suddenly simon stands and walks out
henry looks up and watches him go
he can hardly believe it
he almost raises his voice and apologizes but cant
he lowers his head again and covers his face with his hands listening to simons footsteps receding through the halls
simon walks on away from us down the hospital corridor
seven years later
fay bangs out of the kitchen door with her seven year old son ned
frazzled and overworked she grips a loaded laundry basket to her side as she sits ned down on the curb and points at him
the kid sits still obviously guilty of some unspeakable mischief as fay storms back into the house
he looks around bored then brightens up when he sees
henry coming up the street hanging from the back of a garbage truck
henry enters with ned on his back and the bartender patty goes ballistic
henry what did i tell you about bringing the kid in here
say hello to patty ned
she suddenly becomes all soft and cuddly
how you doin sweetie
you wanna coke
he nods and henry stands him on a stool at the bar
so what did you learn at school today ned
he shakes his head
here ill teach you something
he hands ned a cigarette and lights it for him
ned takes a drag and coughs
horrible isnt it
ned nods in agreement
thatll teach ya
here sip this
and he offers the kid his whiskey
fay comes out of the house and looks for her son
she comes out to the street and looks around
fay comes up looking for ned and sees
pearl age fourteen come out of vickys house
she is fourteen years old now
warren steps out the door and grabs her by the arm
she shakes him off
he slaps her
she runs down the steps and glares back at him
pointing at her im warning you pearl
pearl turns defiantly away and walks into the street
henry is teaching ned how to tip a topless dancer
a dancer stands on the bar and stretches her garter as ned slips a dollar bill in beneath it
some other guy down the bar is reading a newspaper
hey fool its about your friend whats his name
your brother in law
henry looks over
the guy bill shows him the article
what about him
reading the controversial and reclusive american poet simon grim has been awarded the nobel prize in literature
the swedish academy who will confer the award late next week praised mr grim for works of great and difficult striving for the rendering of the desperate the ugly and
the mundane in a language packed with our shared human frailties
god they must be hard up for geniuses to pin medals on because listen i gotta tell you when i first met this guy he didnt even know what an
iambic pentameter was
hes a fraud
keep a lid on it bill youre outta your league
stir things up so as to stay in the newspapers

i could puke all over a piece a loose leaf and be more profound than he is

henry and ned crouch and quiver caught
fay strides up to the bar and grabs the kid
listen you degenerate ive had about enough of this
smells neds breath ned have you been drinking
the kid checks with henry then looks back at fay and nods
fay looks at her husband outraged
explains his throat hurt from smoking
fay slaps him across the face hard and the place goes quiet
henry shakes his head clear and she pokes him in the chest with her finger
henry dont come home tonight
im warning you
dont come home at all
and she storms out with the kid
henry snaps his jaw back into place then looks at patty and bill and shrugs
he knocks back his drink and motions for another
henry staggers out of the back door of the inferno and comes across mr deng sitting against the wall of the store watching the basketball game on a small tv
world of donuts vibrates with loud music
henry gestures to world of donuts
whats going on in there
we gotta have rock n roll shows these days henry
the poetry readings just dont pay the bills no more

it was just a fad
i told you that

thats the problem with this world mr deng
nobodys got any standards anymore

you better sleep in my office tonight henry
she was very angry
youve gotta let her cool off
i cant sleep in there with that racket
henry considers his options then
the place is abandoned
henry comes in and just as he is laying down to go to sleep on an old couch finds pearl age fourteen
she is hardened and disturbed but frequently vulnerable and scared a troubled kid
what are you doing here pearl
you want some
pauses some what
pearl comes towards him
he is kneeling with his face at her crotch level when she reaches him
she holds out a bottle of cheap rot gut wine
realizing he takes it and drinks
pearl laughs and falls back onto the couch her sweater hanging off her shoulder and her skirt hiked up and displaying her underwear
henry stands and searches for something to sit on
come sit here
she pats the couch beside her
he comes over eyeing her carefully and sits
he hands back the bottle
she drinks winces and sits staring at the flames
thats what my dad always says
dead you want some
henry looks away uncomfortable
she slides her gaze over to him their eyes meet and she pins him to the spot
people say you were once in jail for having sex with a girl my age
that was a long time ago
he gets up and stands at the window
pearl age fourteen watches him closely as she drinks then
you want some
he looks over at her and she slides her coat off her shoulder
henry is sweating
you oughta get outta here pearl
i was here first
you go home
and he starts to leave
but pearl sits up
henry stops and looks back at her
hanging her head i cant go home
concerned why not
he beat her up again
henry holds his head tries to sober up
he looks around the room then focuses on the girl
warren beat up your mom
pearl stares at the floor
she glances over at him then back down at the bottle gripped in her hands
henry pauses then comes across the room lowering himself tentatively to the couch
is she alright
she says nothing for a moment then
sadly do you think im pretty
henry lifts his hand and covers his face
he looks up at the ceiling and sighs
he returns to pearl
does she need help
pearl reaches over and grabs his thigh
looking up at him with tears rolling down her face she suggests
ill suck your cock if you kill him for me
henry jumps away from her and pearl throws herself down on the couch covering her face
henry barges in and starts searching for
vicky its henry from across the street
he runs through the house checking the rooms
he throws open the door to the bedroom and finds
vicky sitting on the edge of the bed smoking
she has a black eye and a swollen cheek
taken back vicky
standing what do you think youre doing you idiot
henry looks over and sees warren stumble drunkenly out of the bathroom
what are you doing in my house
to vicky its about pearl
vicky looks troubled
she sits back down with a sigh
mind your own business henry
shoves him yeah who the hell do you think you are anyway
henry falls back and looks at vicky
she looks away
henry looks at warren pauses then gives him a sharp hard shove
warren stands back against the wall pauses then erupts into viciousness
he grabs henry and throws him violently down the hall where he hits the wall and collapses
as henry gets to his knees warren kicks him in the ribs
henry curls up and rolls out on to the kitchen floor
warren kicks him in the side of the head
vicky sits back down on the bed covering her ears
warren beats the hell out of henry kicking him in the face and ribs whenever he manages to get up on his hands and knees
henry crawls under the kitchen table for safety
warren grabs his feet and drags him out
as he is dragged across the floor henry finds a screwdriver and grabs it
he rolls over on his back as
warren lunges down at him again and
warren is stabbed in the heart
henry cant believe it
warren cant believe it
he stands there in the middle of the kitchen amazed with the screwdriver sticking out of his chest
henry semi conscious and severely beaten falls against the back door and coughs up a few of his teeth
vicky steps into the hall from her room and shudders
warren sits at the table stunned
he looks from the screwdriver to vicky then
he falls to the floor
henry staggers away limping
he comes to the intersection at the end of the block and doesnt know which way to run
panicked he looks round holding his arm to his chest
he runs towards the highway
fay is wired beyond belief
trying to listen attentively but still too overwhelmed to maintain her concentration
off it is true your husband served seven years in prison for statutory rape
and when was that
sixteen years ago
and when were you married
we were married seven years ago
were you aware at all of the victims relationship with his daughter
the girl the daughter pearl
she had been having sexual relations with her father
fay is overwhelmed
i didnt know that
pearl claims she offered your husband sexual favors if he would kill her father
fay just looks at him blankly overwhelmed confused
she starts to cry quietly
im just repeating what she said mrs fool
the victims wife vicky claims your husband broke into the house and forcefully entered her bedroom
fay trembles and catches her breath trying to take this all in
a cop hands her some tissues
she takes them and tries to concentrate on what the lawyer says
fay i know this isnt easy
but we need your help here
the girl claims she asked your husband to kill her father in exchange for well i guess the promise of sexual relations with her
fay staggers out into the noisy corridor and rests against the wall
looking down the hall she sees
pearl and vicky sitting in a blank brightly lit room beyond a glass door
fay comes closer and looks in at them
they dont see her
they stare at the floor before them dazed and confused
fay is lying on her bed with her coat still on trying to think
ned stands by the side of the bed watching her
i dont know honey
leave me alone a minute i gotta think
he picks at the bedspread and looks at the ceiling then
is dad in trouble
yes ned he is
hes in big trouble
now just be quiet for two minutes
he walks around to the other side of the bed and waits a moment before
im warning you ned
mom can i be a mailman when i grow up
fay sits up pauses and studies her son
sure you can honey
you can be anything you want
ned is happy to hear this
he shuffles out of the room and fay falls back on the bed
ned comes into the kitchen and digs through the drawers beneath the sink
he finds an envelope
he reads the return address chelsea hotel new york city
ned approaches the subway station and climbs the stairs to the platform
ned runs up the stairs to the elevated platform just as a train pulls into the station
he runs down a few cars and hops in as the doors slide open
ned rides the train to new york city
twenty minutes later
he comes up out of the subway on to the street looks around
he comes into the hotel and rings an annoying buzzer which brings out the concierge who is in his little office watching tv
yeah what do you want
whats his name
the concierge looks through his book as ned waits
there aint no one here by that name
ned pulls the envelope from his pocket unfolds it and shows it to the concierge
the concierge studies the envelope and hands it back
this is post marked five years ago
disappointed ned takes back the envelope and stands looking at his sneakers
what does he look like
hopeless i dont know
cant help ya
ned steps away from the front desk and moves towards the door
but then he stops and looks back at
the concierge sitting back in his office returning his attention to the tv set
the boy heads for the elevator
the concierge looks up and sees him
jumping up hey
ned checks his step and runs for the service stairs
the concierge goes after him
ned runs up the stairs the concierge in pursuit
ned jumps out into the hall narrowly escaping the clutches of the concierge who falls to the floor
ned runs up the hall checking the room numbers as the concierge gets to his feet
the concierge strides up the hall towards him
ned knocks again
the concierge bears down upon him
he knocks again and
the door opens a crack held by its safety chain
a female figure in silhouette is at the narrow gap
ned looks from the door to the concierge approaching
the concierge arrives and reaches out for him but the door opens wide and ned dives in
the concierge stands in the hallway
the door swings shut in his face
ned kneels on the floor of the hotel room waiting to be smacked or something
but when nothing happens he opens his eyes and looks back over his shoulder at
laura the secretary from the publishing house
she is dressed for travel and has her coat hung over her arm a suitcase in her hand
she smiles at him then looks from the boy to someone across the room and
ned follows her gaze to find
simon standing there before him a suitcase in his hand as well
he looks down at ned with a calm intrigued expression
the boy looks up at him in awe
simon steps forward pauses then
get up off your knees
a taxi pulls up
simon and ned climb out and laura leans out of the window
promise me youll be on that plane at seven simon
ill see you in stockholm
the taxi pulls away
simon comes down beside ned takes the boy by the shoulders and whispers in his ear
the kid takes off
simon looks over at world of donuts and sees gnoc waiting there at the door
gnoc leads simon out through the kitchen
a band is seen doing a sound check inside
bunuel and hawkes are waiting there looking concerned
simon gives bunuel his passport
bunuel nods and leaves
hawkes and gnoc open the cellar doors
simon is lead down the stairs and stops
he looks on in horror at
henry lying on a makeshift bed badly beaten up and weak
mr deng is wrapping his chest in bandages
simon pauses then comes closer
he reaches out and touches henrys shoulder standing there looking down at his friend
henry looks up at him pauses and then gestures vaguely with his hand
look simon the worlds a scary place
i admit it
but its not my fault
simon thinks about this and looks away
im sorry henry
you had things to do
so did you
henry thinks about that sighs and looks away
fay packs up the many books of the confession into one of the old suitcases henry first came to town with
she slams it shut
ned runs along the street and stops at the police car
he points down the street with great urgency
the cops jump in their cars and take off
he then looks over at
fay leaving the house with henrys suitcase
bunuel backs his car into the alley behind world of donuts
stepping out of the car he hands simon back the passport
simon checks it and then looks up to see
father hawkes and mr deng helping henry outside
coming out into the daylight he straightens up and manages to walk on his own
he motions ned over and leans down to the kid with difficulty
he has his own zippo lighter and he proudly lights his dads cigarette
henry smokes hugs ned then leans back and pauses
take care of your mom and dont start trouble you cant finish
ned nods and henry pats him on the shoulder
then he stands before fay and looks at his feet
with her arms folded across her chest and her hip cocked she taps her foot impatiently and waits for his last line of crap
i love you fay
rolls her eyes yeah well tough
but then she looks at him and softens
he leans in and kisses her passionately on the mouth
moments later they all help henry into bunuels car and simon gets in behind the wheel
the doors slam shut and simon steers the car slowly up the alley
henry gazes out at fay running along beside the car with the rest of the neighborhood some of them laughing some of them crying
simon pulls up at the curb and jumps out
he helps henry climb out and together they enter the terminal
henry steps up
passport and ticket please
henry hands them over
he glances back at
the clerk compares henry to the picture in the passport checks again then
recognizes its an honor to meet you mr grim
i mean god
congratulations on the nobel prize
i know all your work by heart
it changed my life
look thanks but
she types something more into the computer then looks up urgently
youll have to hurry sir
theyre holding the plane for you on the runway
airline representatives come rushing up with walkie talkies to meet henry and simon as they run through the terminal
this way please this way
this way mr grim
as they are ushered up towards the gate henry stops and looks off at the security guards and ground crew waiting for him certain they can spot him as a
shoves him go on
henry is ushered through security
they take his ticket and check his passport again
they take his suitcase and place it on the conveyor belt
he passes through the metal detector
they pass the metal detector wand over him and he stands there with his hands outstretched as
simon waits and watches
the suitcase rolls out from the x ray machine and as henry grabs it he stops and looks across the security checkpoint at
simon standing there
he steps forward anxiously
henry lingers speechless but the airline representatives are at his side
mr grim please the plane is waiting
we have to hurry
they drag him away but henry looks back as
simon stops and watches
the plane is waiting out on the asphalt and the airline representative runs straight for it calling back over her shoulder to henry
this way mr grim
runway technicians rush to their positions but henry hangs back and struggles across the tarmac looking back over his shoulder at
simon behind the huge plate glass window of the terminal
he stops and waits
simon raises his hand in farewell and
henry raises his in reply
then simon unheard behind the gigantic glass wall silent amongst the roar of the runway says
and henry understands
he lowers his hand waits just a moment then turns and looks out at
the airline representative is shouting at him from the foot of the stairs and waving him on with her walkie talkie
he glances back once more at simon
henry is running struggling towards us forcing himself towards the plane getting stronger and running faster with every step he takes
