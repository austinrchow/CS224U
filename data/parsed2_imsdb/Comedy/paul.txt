written by simon pegg nick frost caption bethlehem creek wyoming pm the air is filled with the sounds of a warm summer night
a light comes on in a farmhouse window
the door opens a small dog and a young girl emerge
go on now paul dont be long
the dog trots out across the property
it stops to scratch
the sounds of night cease
the dog stops scratching sniffing the air cocking its head sensing something
we hear a low humming sounds
the dog looks up
we see a soft orange glow reflected in its eyes
the dog whimpers back at the farmhouse a deep dull thud shakes the ground bringing the small girl back out onto the veranda
an orange glow pulsates somewhere out in the darkness
the girl draws near illuminated by the orange glow
the glow fades again
music the boy in the bubble by paul simon
graham willy and clive gollings stand in the blazing san diego sunshine waiting to cross the road
graham is thin but his clothes seem too small
he has long greasy hair buck teeth and thick glasses
clive is bigger and wears a long black leather coat red dwarf t shirt and boots
his hair is densely curly and shaped like a pyramid
four people dressed as borg from star trek pass by
graham and clive shrug derisively
the cross walk beeps
as the music kicks in graham and clive set off across the road towards the san diego convention centre
they make their way through a throng of costumed comic con attendees
graham and clive are at a fantasy weapons stand
clive is brandishing a katana sword
he test the balance the weight the sharpness
he closes one eye and looks down the length of the blade
he nods appreciatively
japanese folded steel
real hero shit
clive nods puts the sword down and walks away
arent you gonna get it
no its rubbish
we see them on an escalator walking down a wide corridor passing people in a variety of costumes
finally they join a line of people waiting to meet the actor michael biehn
what are you going to ask
do you feel that the killing of hicks and newt in alien invalidates ripleys struggle at the closed of the previous installment
i was going to ask that
tough tits four eyes
suddenly nervous graham approaches
michael biehn is signing pictures
he is pleasant if business like
whos it to
there you go
security moves graham on
whos it to
there you go
security moves clive on
clive scrambles for his camera
i need to photograph him
you can take it from there
clive and graham huddle together and try to position themselves with michael biehn in the background
clive takes the shot
we see a frozen image of clive and graham with michael biehn barely visible in the background
the pair move off looking at their spoils
that was amazing
i was actually a bit nervous
good egg wasnt he
yes very unaffected
damn i forgot to give him my card
clive points at security
give it to colossus
hey rosario dawsons here
she needs to call me
graham and clive sit at a table fiddling nervously with pens
on either side of them are stacks of their new book jelva alien queen of the varvak
a banner hangs behind displaying the tomes cover a muscular green woman in a gold bikini rides a blue rhino
she lashes at the beast with a laser whip
she has three tits
a lanky publicist paces up and down making sure everything is in order
looks good right
yes its very impressive
it really does the image justice
i never noticed the third tit
that was grahams idea
ladies man huh
you guys happy
you got enough pens
you wanna snapple
you wanna a diet coke
ill have a fat coke please
a fat what
oh you man a fat coke

sylars doing a q and a in the main pavillion
i wanted to go to that
i wanted to find out if he actually eats the brains
i can make a call
itll pick up when hes done
the hard works done we have a great story and as usual your renderings jump from the page
all we have to do now is sit back and enjoy
a child approaches
queen jelva welcomes thee
do you know where sylars on
hey three tits
caption minutes later they are sat in exactly the same position as before
clive looks a little downbeat graham fidgets with his pens
okay thats the hour
howd we do
hey one for each tit
maybe you should have given her four
dont sweat it
its a sleeper
yeah but three copies
better than carl weathers
would you like a copy
are you nuts
my office is full of junk
the publicist walks away chuckling
graham i need a drink
graham and clive are stood against the wall in a bar
graham drinks and elaborate blue cocktail through a straw
clive sips from a jack daniels and coke
everyone else in the bar is dressed as a hobbit
clive winks at a girl
graham and clives hotel room is filled with bags of stuff from the convention a laptop computer and a games console plugged into the tv
graham lies on his bed
he is looking at a map
other maps are scattered about
it was like the prancing pony in there
clive emerges from the bathroom
he is naked but for a black towel wrapped around his waist
his hair is wet and suddenly incredibly long
around his neck a large animal tooth hangs on a black leather cord
they think theyre so cool
hey are you excited about going to area
graham and clive both look at their watches
three two one
good night graham
good night clive
they switch off their respective bedside lights
the room is plunged into pitch darkness
a few seconds pass
are you asleep
shall we try and storm the citadel before we nod off
couldnt hurt could it
we hear some movement then the room is illuminated by the tv
the boys lie on their beds holding games controllers
graham and clive stand at reception
both look extremely sleepy
clives eyes close
graham lolls forward onto the reception desk
his head hits the bell
the boys stand waiting for their transport
we see them from across the road
a tiny old car splutters up to the curb
a valet gets out and hands the keys to clive
there you go
thats not ours
no thats ours
a large rv pulls up
a holiday rambler imperial
top of the range in its day
still looks good
graham and clive run off toward the rv
the four borg from the previous day approach the valet and exchange the key to the car for some small change
the borg drive off
giving the finger assimilate this
the rv speeds past the disgruntled valet
graham and clive can be heard whooping within
clive is seated behind the wheel of their rv he now wears black wrap around shades
in the back of the rv graham fusses with maps and provisions
no lets punch through
miles make the eggs taste sweeter
i love eggs
i hear that
now get that joe on the go and jump in the chewie seat
i need your map skills
good job i pre pared
graham flicks on the coffee and jumps into the co pilots chewie seat
its a shame i dont have some controls on this side
that way i could take over if you needed the loo
yeah i could say take the helm
take the helm number one
yeah take the helm number one i need a number two
they laugh heartily
through this graham has been taking out his laptop and setting it up on the dash board
least ive got cerebro eh
real time sat nav multi map and advanced geo tagging with continual info stream
and lets not forget weve always got analogue
graham pulls a map down
obscuring the entire windshield
not when were driving graham
graham sends the map back up into the roller
the coffee percolator gurgles in the galley
sounds like coffee oclock
im a wreck until ive had my first cup of j
graham high fives clive and heads back into the kitchen
graham and clive eat lunch
graham has finished a plate of prawns
he inspects the shells
looks like a pile of dead droids
a perky waitress approaches
graham and clive become shy and awkward
you boys all set
can i get you anything else
graham spills his drink
clive appears very uneasy
they drive in silence surveying the landscape
amazing isnt it
there are people in this country and we havent seen a soul for a hundred miles
where is everybody
what about that old woman on crutches we saw hitchhiking
apart from her
i suppose thats why they established the dreamland facility out here
far from prying eyes
did you know the site was selected in the mid s for testing of the u spyplane due to its remoteness proximity to existing facilities and presence of a dry
lake bad for landings
shall we have a bite before or after we hit the black mailbox
graham and clive tuck into burgers
they are the only customers
the interior is replete with various area related memorabilia
pat female s the proprietor speaks to them from behind the counter
she holds up two bumper stickers
watch the skies or alien onboard
graham and clive look at each other for a few seconds before looking back at pat
so where have you boys come from
how could you tell
we see graham and clive looking back at pat
they look like the most painfully obvious comic con attendees ever
just a guess
my nephew launched a comic down there a couple of years ago
sort of dramatized the accounts of some of the folk weve had in here
you heard of it huh
ive got all six
well whaddya know
do you get a lot of ufo types round here
we see pat looking back at clive surrounded by ufo and alien paraphernalia a slight smile on her face
have you ever seen one
oh ive seen plenty
youve seen more than one ufos
well i dont know what they were
so as far as im concerned theyre unidentified and they were definitely flying
whether or not they were spaceships i cant say
probably not but id like to think they were
be a shame if we were the only souls in the universe
did you now its estimated that there are as many as billion galaxies in the observable universe and each of those has approximately billion starts around which orbit countless planets
makes you think though dont it
where is everybody
graham and clive ponder this
you boys all set
id like a cup of coffee please
how about you sugar
can i have an e
you wanna sparkler in that
graham smiles coyly
ill take that as a yes
she beams at the boys and disappears into the kitchen
graham and clive are left alone
they take it all in
its nice here isnt it
i think i might use the loo
clive walks through a door marked maliens
the adjacent toilet door gus and jake enter
graham becomes uneasy
yes dear what can i get you
coming right up
clive washes his hands
he pumps soap from a dispenser which is shaped like an aliens head the soap squirts out of its mouth
clive is quite taken with this
that is absolutely amazing
clive appears out of the toilet with his hands in the air
hey graham an alien just sicked up into my palms
clive doesnt see the two men sat up at the counter
he strides over to graham full of excitement
im joking of course
they have a soap dispenser shaped like an aliens head
when you pump his jaw soap comes out of his mouth
graham flicks his eyes to the counter
clive looks over and sees the two men
they are glaring back
clive immediately loses his confident air
here it comes
graham closes his yes remembering what he ordered
the two men turn to see pat emerge from the kitchen with a tray of drinks
two bottles of beer one cup of coffee and an absurd looking milkshake in a tall glass with a sparkler
okay then beers for you gentleman
a cup of joe and a extra thick malt with a sparkler for the boys from outer space
the man snigger derisively
pat senses the tension
so where you boys headed
were heading into utah
do ourselves some hunting
deer coon beaver whatever steps in front of the bangstick right jake
they throw a look back at graham and clive
you got that right gus
well now i heard utah beaver puts up quite a fight
thats what were counting on
they nudge each other and laugh
i better make you something good and hot
long way to the beehive
pat give graham and clive a look
clive understands and fumbles for hi wallet
he places a number of bills on the table
graham comes back in and retrieves the bumper sticker
pat gives him a wink
graham boards the rv
clive is in the drivers seat
the engine is running
what took you so long
i was putting the sticker on
they were an odd pair werent they
definitely didnt speak bocci
clive fires up the engine and jams it into reverse
that wasnt their truck was it
the rv roars off leaving the car park and the black lincoln escalade shiny mean dented
graham looks at a map
clive drives continually checking his rear view
whats the matter
how we doing
we should be just about there
they scan the roadside for a few seconds
ive found it
the rv comes to a screeching halt
it sits in the road for a moment before it trundles onto the hard shoulder
the door opens graham and clive appear wearing head mounted torches
they wander over to a white mailbox
the black mailbox
graham and clive marvel at it
the silence of the night and the size of the landscape dawns on them
they look up
its amazing isnt it
were actually here
the groom lake military test facility
macarthurs black mile
is that a real one
no i made it up myself
i like it
be great if we saw something
yes imagine if we got buzzed up by a craft
that would be incredible
it just sort of stops in the air and hovers then just goes up really fast
what would you do if they actually landed
keep it together
first contact is a big responsibility
they come in peace we go to pieces
thats not how i roll
clive looks at graham who is staring off wide eyed
graham points off into the distance
they found us
i dont know how but they found us
whos found us
run for it marty
graham and clive scramble for the rv
clive drives graham looks nervous
in the dashboard of the rv is a rear view monitor
they look at it intently
perhaps its not them
perhaps whoever it was turned doff
of course its them
its like deliverance
theyre going to rape us and break our arms
i dont want my arms broken
theres only one thing for it
im gonna have to fly blind
clive kills the headlights
they are plunged into darkness still travelling at mph
the headlights come back on
probably best not to do that
i couldnt really see anything
they stare at the monitor
suddenly creeping up the rear of the rv headlights
the front of a car becomes visible
oh god oh god oh god
i need the toilet
the vehicle behind pulls out to overtake
theyre trying to overtake
dont let them get past
should i ram them
what about the deposit
clive gingerly jerks the wheel causing the rv to swerve
a black sedan car appears next to them manoeuvering wildly to avoid the rv
graham and clive stare in horror their eyes widen as the car flips over and tumbles several times bouncing across the asphalt and sliding to a smoking stop on its
grahams mouth hangs open
it wasnt them
the rv pulls up to the crashed vehicle and stops
graham and clive peer out of the window
we should see if theyre okay
i still need a wee
i can hold mine
graham goes to the back of the rv and into the toilet
clive remains int he driving seat staring out at the mangled sedan
the toilet flushes and graham reappears
the bulbs gone in there
graham and clive step out of the rv and approach the car
inside are three unconscious men
one door is open
they wait for a few seconds
maybe you should call for help
graham pulls out a cell phone and starts to dial
i wouldnt do that if i were you
graham and clive spin round to see an indistinct figure sitting on a rock in the nearby darkness
the glow of a cigarette briefly lights up what appear to be two large black eyes
graham and clive gawp
i rather think these men need help
graham give me the phone
graham passes the phone over
seriously i wouldnt do that
grahams mouth falls open clive continues to hold the phone to his ear
we hear the operator
how may i direct your call
graham and clive continue to gawp
the shape stand and steps into the light
graham and clive go slack
standing in front of them clad only in cut off short and flip flops
is an put the phone down
without the slightest change of expression clive rocks backwards in a dead faint
he hits the ground with a bump
graham looks at clive then back at the alien
when graham speaks his voice quivers with hysterical panic
what have you done to him
i didnt do anything
yes but you made him faint
i did not
okay i did but its not like i set my phaser to faint
youve got a phaser
look i need you to help
can you get this guy back onto your wagon
are you going to probe us
where does that come from
why do people always assume we want to stick something up their ass
theres certainly nothing about it in the encounter manual
as a rule we dont even abduct
maybe people find it easier to deal with earthly transgressions if they suppress it with absurd fantasies about alien probing
its just a theory
listen focus okay
i promise you i wont hurt you i just need your help
you need my help
how come i can understand you
are you using some sort of neural language router
no im speaking english you prick
off grahams expression sorry im tense
look whats your name
what about him
thats the writer clive gollings
well lets get clive into the rv and get going
ill explain everything on the way
where are we going
the rvs gotta be back in days
well then were gonna have to hustle arent we
look graham youre just gonna have to trust me okay
graham looks at the alien
it stands at roughly feet tall
his black almond shaped eye glint
his large head tilts to one side his small mouth opens slightly his long fingers clasp together pleading
please man i need you
graham considers the alien for a moment
whats your name
now lets get cloverfield onto the recreational vehicle and get the fuck off macarthurs black mile
they attempt to move clive
paul senses something
oh man has he
i told him he should have gone
could have been worse
know what im saying
they drag him into the rv
the door shuts a few seconds later graham appears and runs round to the back of the rv
he rips the bumper sticker off and gets back on board
the rv starts up and drives off
graham drives agitated
he looks behind him a couple of times
paul is hunting around in the fridge
can i have this ham
paul starts to dangle strips of sandwich ham into his mouth wolfing it down hungrily
where am i going again
i told you north
do you have a map
graham pulls the map
it obscures the wind shield
not when were driving graham
the map disappears back up into the roller
just head north
we need to get as much distance as we can between us and them
we hear the noise of engines then boots on concrete as a dozen soldiers rush the area attending the crash
a suited man gets out of a sedan car
we dont see his face at first
the shot remains at his hip
he reaches into his pocket and pulls out a twinkie
he unwraps it and brings it up to his mouth
we follow and see his face for the first time
chiselled focused confident
this is special agent zoil
a soldier approaches
talk to me
three survivors company men hurt but alive
zoil looks into the sky and breathes in the night air
the captain motions to a patch of moisture near his feet
zoil touches the wet patch and licks his finger
what is it sir
its neither of those things
he looks around then notices tire tracks in the dust by the side of the road
zoil stands full of purpose
he returns to his car and hits a button on the dash
whats the situation
we have a guest whos left the hotel without paying sir
do you think hes left left
norad would have picked up a bogie
those guys can track santa
no sir hes still here
question is for how long
dont you think this is all a bit of a coincidence
i signed the red document this morning zoil
dont you think its odd that he chooses today to go awol
how did he know
are you suggesting he has someone on the inside
well hes definitely got someone on the outside
tire tracks sir
among other things
id bet my left nut that little bastards hitched a ride
lock down the area
road blocks spot checks the whole nine yards
youre going to handle this personally zoil
i want this wrapped up before letterman
close on the wheel
pull out to reveal the rv
inside clives eyes open
from the bathroom clive can hear the sound of someone noisily emptying their bladder
he notices his jeans have been pegged up to dry
he leans out to see graham in the driving seat then looks back at the bathroom door
the toilet flushes
clive pretends to be asleep as the door opens
a pair of skinny grey legs in cut off shorts pass the bunk
the bulbs gone in there
clive gets up silently and wraps his black towel around his middle
he creeps toward the front of the rv
graham drives paul sits in the chewie seat eating pistachios
i hate it when you get the closed ones right
i usually bite them open
are you fucking insane
you gotta tap em and if they dont open you throw them away
how are you feeling
im feeling like ive gone mental mad graham
if that is your name
youre happily sitting there chatting to
that like its the most natural thing in the world
the two of you laughing away like you havent seen each other since
paul spits a shell out into a cup
so forgive me if i seem a little rattled but from where im standing it would appear you are trading nut knowledge with an alien life form
his name is paul
oh paul is it
you know like madonna or dracula
pauls from a small planet in the northern spiral arm of the andromeda galaxy
no he is not
i am man seriously
how could he possibly have travelled that distance
graham this isnt what it seems
what about ochams razor
yes the old man who owns it told me that in unbelievable circumstances the most plausible explanation is usually the truth
and whats the most plausible explanation clive
that youre a thin midget in an alien costume
theres no such thing as a thin midget
those guys are built
have you not seen the station agent
i think thats less believable than paul being form a planet in the norther spiral arm of the andromeda galaxy
with this clive grabs at paul
he pulls at the aliens skin trying to gain a hold of a mask
get off me
youre not real
youre not real
get off me you fucking psycho
clive releases paul and looks out of the rv to see the flashing lights of a road block
graham slows down
clive looks round to discover that paul has vanished
graham pulls the rv onto the hard shoulder
wheres he gone
maybe he beamed up
we would have seen the classic shimmer and hum
graham and clive look to the door
graham and clive stand outside the rv being questioned by an agent dressed like zoil
we can hear noise and activity from the rv
another agent is aboard the rv
where you boys from
the agent smiles
graham and clive look terrified
whatcha doin in the us fellas
youre a long way from san diego
we were having a little drive
is that right
oreilly appears at the door waving a x photograph
these guys have met michael biehn
how was he
he was a good egg
thats nice to hear
just some pissy jeans
haggard looks down at the towel wrapped around clives waits
clive look embarrassed
okay you guys can go
may i ask what youre searching for
of course you may
there is a slight pause
graham and clive board the rv
graham and clive pull away in silence
they are both confused and shaken
well its pretty obvious what happened there isnt it
yes the government used some sort of neurotoxic paint on the black mailbox which was white by the way and it caused us to suffer a shared hallucination about an
i mean its what weve always wanted isnt it
i suppose so
than thats what happened
paul materializes from thin air behind them
the sound of screeching tires draws the attention of the two agents
they see the rv swerve across the road in the distance before righting itself and continuing on its way
where the hell did you go
what you went invisible
its not invisibility per so
its more like what a chameleon does with a little light blending thrown in for good measure
can you do it whenever you want
we hear graham squeal with delight
the rv guns up the road into the night
clive drives in silence
paul sits in the passenger seat eating nuts
day is breaking over the horizon
graham snoozes on the sofa
paul offers clive a nut
no thank you
how about a cup of coffee
sees hes tempted come on hulk ill get you a nice cuppa j
paul goes back to the galley flicking graham on the nose as he passes
graham wakes up with a start
hey look whos up
graham approaches clive who ignores him
whats the matter
graham there is a grey in the galley making me coffee
did you want tea
no i dont want tea
teas a bit weird in america isnt it
no whats wried graham is that we have picked up an extra terrestrial hitch hiker and you seem completely fine with it
he needs our help clive
paul returns with the coffee
graham and clive curtail their conversation
paul hand clive his coffee
you got it
yes ive got it
slightly testy thank you
graham looks at paul and nods toward clive
paul sighs and sits in the chewie seat
graham hangs back
look clive im gonna go out on a limb and say this is probably the weirdest thing thats ever happened to you
am i right
clive doesnt deny it
and i appreciate the fact that i have somewhat gate crashed the party here but truth be told im in a hell of a pickle
i really need your help
clive glances back at an expectant graham
what about the rv
it has to be back in two days
clive hes an alien
a living breathing alien
clive look at paul who makes a sad face and does the hand gesture from close encounters
i suppose we could phone the hire company and get an extension
paul looks super pleased
how did you get here
anti grav failure
happens to the best of us
also im a shit driver
oh my god
that was you
roswell was a smoke screen man designed to distract from the truth
they invented a fake alien crash to distract from an actual alien crash
i know fucking stupid isnt it
what have you been doing here all this time
oh you know kickin back shooting the shit
advising the government
not just the government
a room lit by a single bulb furnished with a table and chair
paul sits with his back to us he is smoking a cigarette whilst talking on the phone
we hear the voice on the other end of the line
it is strangely familiar
i want him to have some kind of special power you know
something sort of messianic
how about molecular revivification
i dont know what that is
restoration of damaged tissue through telepathic manipulation of cellular intrinsic field memory
oh right yeah
like by touch sort of thing
his little finger could light up at the end and you know what
sometimes less is more
the line beeps
you got another call
yeah i gotta take this man
its the fucking v guys again
youd be surprised how much hes influenced popular culture generally over the last years
how come you know so much
we had quite a long chat while you were unconscious
clive looks miffed
while you were asleep
you want a bagel clive
go on then ill have half
you want anything on it
paul heads to the kitchen
the boys drive in silence
i gave your jeans a swill and hung them up
so do you know where were going
he said we had to make a right at utah
why cant he tell us
he said it was a surprise
do you trust him graham
i mean is he strider or black rider
youd better be right
i dont want to wake up and find him inserting a probe into my anus
its okay he doesnt do that
paul returns with three bagels on one long finger
the dashboard beeps
paul jumps throwing them into the air
fuel levels critical
sorry i had a warning light just like that on my ship
anti grav failure
clive is looking at the sat nav on the computer
theres a place called ely five miles from here
its small but there should be a gas station
roger that number one
clive smiles at graham and flashes paul a triumphant look
paul coughs loudly barely disguising the word geeks
graham and clive peer out at the gas station
it appears deserted
paul has his head in the fridge he cracks open a v strolls to the front of the rv and honks the horn
an old man peers out of the gas station window and waves
paul dont do that
heres what i need
some organic beef mince organic pork some veal red onions pine nuts pecorino cheese plum tomatoes a fistful of fresh basil and war ciabattas
you know this is a gas station
paul looks disappointed
the door to the rv opens clive and graham step out onto the forecourt trying to look as casual as they can
graham and clive jump
get me some more peanut m ms
graham goes into the store clive to the pumps
a police cruiser pulls onto the forecourt
clive goes pale and fumbles the nozzle back into the pump
he walks toward the checkout as a state trooper exits his car
no matter how hard he tries clive cannot avoid reaching the door at the same time as the state trooper
he is tall wide and bald
close up on oreilly
he covers his face with his hands
ready or not
oreilly uncovers his eyes and comes face to face with zoil
zoil is eating an orange he offers a segment to oreilly
nice and juicy
i dont want to spoil breakfast
do you mind telling me whats going on agent
just keeping ourselves occupied sir
things are pretty slow
wheres the other one
i dont know lets see
haggard steps out from behind the only man shaped cactus on the entire desert plain
oreilly cant help but let out a snort of delighted surprise
haggard hurries over
sorry i was just
you fellas had much traffic through here
just a big rv driven by a couple of nerds
yeah theyd been to comic con and met michael biehn
ive heard hes nice
did you search the vehicle thoroughly
just michael biehns autograph and some pissy jeans
close in on zoil
he seems suddenly motivated
did you get the license plate
haggard and oreilly look sheepish
it was big
i want everything you can remember
descriptions of the occupants height hair distinguishing features
we can do it on the way
on the way
youre coming with me
what about the road block sir
it didnt work
graham joins clive at the check out clutching a bag of jerky a bottle of chocolate milk a burrito a coke some mini doughnuts and a massive bag of peanut
dont you think thats a bit much
put it all back
except the burrito
and the doughnuts
and the chocolate milk
lets just pay for it and leave
we need bulb for the toilet
essential only graham
they head to the counter
so does the state trooper
who do you think i had in my office this morning
the secret service
graham bumps into a display of sunglasses and just stops it tumbling
chris and the state trooper glance over
they find out how you can afford a dodge viper on troopers pay
theyre all over this crash on the road up to rachel
what you thinks going on
dont know could be muslims
clive and graham sidle up to the check out
you go right ahead
thank you very much officer
wherere you guys from
chris take the money and the boys leave
the state trooper and chris watch them go
the boys hurry across the forecourt past the cop car we hear the radio spring to life as they pass
all units be on the lookout for a cream and brown recreational vehicle no plate number at this time
officers are advised to contain but not board
dean if you still at gas and go bring back a quart a milk and a box of doughnut holes
graham and clive stop and stare listening intently
paul sit on the sofa catching m ms in his mouth
graham drives clive sits in the chewie seat
its find for you
youll get whisked back to whatever lab they kept you in and well be arrested for harbouring a fugitive and sent to guantanamo bay
whys everything so funny
they think were muslims
thats their excuse for everything
there are worse things you can be
we had a muslim guy at the base
systems analyst called yusef
we used to do karaoke on tuesday nights
you shoulda heard him do matthew and son
shame i didnt get a chance to say salam alaikum
paul the authorities know were in an tv
were hardly the only rv on the road
trust me if we stay off the highways keep to the back routes well have a nice uneventful journey
something strikes the windshield
graham bring the rv to a halt
the door to the rv swings open clive and graham step out
the desert road is silent
we can see for miles
on the road lies a yellow and black bird it is very dead
fuck that made me jump
ah yes the waspish markings of a scotts oriole
what a waste
nothing anyone couldve done
paul looks at them then scoops the bird up in his hands
what are you doing
paul closes his eyes
his skin ripples with color as he sways slightly
the birds eyes flicker its head lifts it opens its beak and tweets
graham and clive are astounded by what they are seeing
its a miracle
paul stuff the bird in his mouth with a grotesque crunch
ill miss these
why would you do that
im not gonna eat a dead bird am zoil and his men are parked on the forecourt of the gas station
zoil is talking to the state trooper and chris
by the time i got the bulletin they were long gone
seemed like nice fellas to me
is it true they was muslims
they said they were british
i think you can be both
excuse me gentlemen
zoil leaves with the two men and returns to his vehicle
the voice of zoils superior cuts the air
weve tracked them down to a gas station in ely
so why am i not witting with my feet up smoking a jay watching erin brockovich
we think he may be travelling in an rv with two british men sir
goddamnit i knew we should have gone ahead with invasion in
what are they mi
just a couple of nerds on the lamb from comic con
my sisters kid went to that
little manga faggot
i still think this stinks sir
like fat man doo doo
its too much of a coincidence
he sits tight for years and then suddenly now he decides to take off
if he wanted to go home so bad he couldve just given us the slip when he was playing golf with j
someone must have told him
we need to find the rat
leave that to me
in the meantime if e
is still m
in the p
im tearing someone a new a
graham is sat in the chewie seat paul is reading jelva queen of the varvak
what do you think
ask me when ive finished it
clide rubs his yes
you tired sausage
dont call me sausage in front of him
are you tired though
mummy i am bushed
what do you need
best case id like a cold flannel on my neck and an honest meal
i hear that big rig
i can still call you big rig cant i
just not sausage
any luck with an rv park
we need somewhere off the beaten track nest pas
cup of joe
you read my mind
graham head to the galley ignoring paul who jumps into the chewie seat and stares at clive
can i help you
you want a cigarette
no thank you
i dont smoke
paul lights a cigarette the smoke wafts into clives face
look im sorry okay
about eating the bird
clive continues to ignore paul
graham arrives with the coffee and a honey bun cake
could you unwrap it for me
by your command
graham unwraps the cake and pops it into clives gob
graham disappears to the back of the rv
let me ask you something
are you to
paul does a very weird very long charade demonstrating various group and one on one homosexual practices
okay thats great
i just wondered
im cool with it
everyones bi where im from
its all about the pleasure thing you know
weve evolved beyond paranoid notions of gender identity
i mean procreation is only the functional aspect of sexual congress right
the human race is fairly advanced but most males still act like a cornered tiger if you imply the like smoking the bone and lets face it they probably do
look at single sex empirical institutions boarding schools prisons pirate ships places where the choice has been removed everyones banging everyone else and there isnt a whiff of socio cultural
get out into the real world and guys are getting smacked int he chops for wearing pink socks
you think youre so sophisticated because you can distinguish yourself from your own reflection but ultimately youre part of a deeply neurotic species and youd all be a lot better
off if you stopped worrying and learned to love the bum
what are you trying to say
maybe you should start smoking
later the rv pulls up to gate at the front of an rv park
graham is now in the chewie seat paul stands behind steadying himself on the backs of their chairs
great find graham
i sourced a website listing off the beaten track north american rv parks
i really lucked out with you nerds didnt i
graham and clive look proud
clive drives the rv over a speed hump into the park
paul loses his balance and falls over
graham and clive laugh
they pull up to a gate
its awfully quiet
just the way we like it
paul scrambles to his feet reaches across clive and rest on the horn
stop doing that
paul shimmers and disappears
graham and clive yelp
quietly to graham were just a couple of regular guys on a tour of the less touristy side of the american midwest
i dont think she heard you
i was talking to you
graham opens the door
ruth behe a young woman in her mid twenties stands outside
she is pretty but has no idea
she wears glasses one eye of which is blacked out
graham stares at her
we hear the slide guitar moment from olivia newton johns hopelessly devoted to you
good evening im ruth behe
do you mind if we come in
park in bay
the charge is for the night plus for hook ups an ill need to hang onto an id too
clive disappears leaving graham and ruth alone
were just a couple of regular guys on tour of the less touristy side of the american midwest
where you heading next
clive returns with his passport
ruth looks at it
i love london
have you been
did you know it was founded by the romans in ad as londinium
id love to go someday
theres lots a places i wanna go
the worlds a big place
i need one of these though
you dont have a passport
ruth shakes her head forlornly
graham and clive stare
get in here
im hungry thats my father
ill come over and take your money in the morning
have a pleasant night now wont you
ruth opens the gate to allow clive to drive through
graham watches ruth intently as they pass
doors to manual and cross check
paul re materializes next to graham and clive
ruth is walking back to a static mobile home
from the rv we hear graham and clive yelp
ruth furrows her brow turns back and goes inside
ruth enters a static mobile home and heads for kitchenette
from the ad joining room we hear the sound of someone using a police radio scanner
garbled reports fade in and out
we perhaps even hear zoils voice briefly amid the static
what took you so long
i was just talking
ruth stirs a pot on the stove
she surreptitiously retrieves an atlas from a drawer an starts to read
you talk to much
how long they staying
just the night i think hook ups
where they headed
them california plates i saw
yes but theyre from london
no london england
its in north western europe
the atlas is snatched out of ruths hands
behind her stands the towering figure of moses behe
almost as wide as he is tall his eyes glitter with fury and menace
ill give you europe missy
now get and make my supper
moses lumbers off with the atlas
ruth looks dejected
quick cuts as graham and clive hook up power and water to the rv and prepare a small bbq
the door to the rv opens graham and clive jump in
paul lowers his book and is blinded by their headlamps
arrghh what the fuck
i ate already
graham and clive look suddenly sad
hey im sorry
id love to break bread with you guys
what are we having
graham waves a foot long hot dog around
paul gives clive a see what i mean
ill flame up the bbq pit
fires my forte
clive sparks up his lighter and waves it around looking mysterious
he then turns and jumps down all three steps and slams the door of the rv behind him
clive is squirting lighter fluid over a fire
he flicks his tongue out summoning the flames higher
paul materializes nearby making clive jump
he composes himself
from the squirting of the gas and the flicking of the tongue am i do assume youre a hendrix fan
i am actually yes
i met him once
nice man really soft he thought i was a hallucination
shame what happened to him
all the good ones die
meanwhile bryan adams releases album seventeen
paul and clive share a laugh
so youve been here for years
i know right
time flies when youre confined to a u
why did you come to earth
im the vanguard of a highly aggressive invading force
im fucking with you man
i was on a science mission actually
we were surveying atmospheric conditions on co spiking m class planets
my specialist subject is tornadoes right
so im buzzing around the mid west looking for twisters and all of a sudden my a
goes offline and i crash in the middle of some field
next thing i know this little girl is pulling me out of the wreck and then a bunch of army guys come along and cart me off to area
area is just full of old pan am jets and mini disc players and shit
its another clever subterfuge
graham joins them with the food
just telling him about area
ha ha yeah
so with my cover blown and the natives cautious but friendly i figured we might as well indulge in a little file sharing
mulder was right
mulder was my idea
clive gives paul the bottle of gas
would you like a go
paul takes the bottle and squirts it on the fire making the hendrix face
they laugh loudly
ruth watches through her window
graham clive and paul are on the other side of the rv
nevertheless ruth can see three pairs of dancing legs underneath the vehicle silhouetted against the campfire
ruth backs away into the shadows
it is very early in the morning
paul is asleep on the sofa
there is a knock at the door
graham and clive emerge from the bedroom in dressing gowns
who is it
graham and clive look at each other nervously
clive opens the door as graham straightens his hair
may i come in
clive give graham a what the hell are you thinking
look as ruth comes aboard
ruth surveys the interior of the rv
was everything to your liking
yes thank you
wheres the other one
the other one
its okay we dont charge by the person
that was three pairs of legs i saw last night cavorting round the camp fire right
oh the other one
im in the can
i ate a closed mollusc
paul blows a massive raspberry to prove his point
graham and clive look embarrassed
graham changes the subject
i like your shirt
the shirt has a picture of jesus shooting charles darwin in the head
underneath it reads evolve this
i got it at my church
why would jesus want to shoot charles darwin
because of his theories
are you men of god
would you like a coffee
i suppose were men of science
ruth narrow her eye
if we believe in anything it would be macro evolution
cause and effect
the establishment of a biological order from the maelstrom of physical and chemical chaos
ruth looks scandalized
or it could be god
you just dont know do you
god created the earth in six days and on the seventh he rested
paul emits another huge raspberry from the toilet
did you know that the universe has been dated as being
billion years old an that the release of neutral hydrogen at the moment of the big bang has enabled scientists to do this with categorical accuracy
the world is years old
oh come on
ruth approaches the toilet door taking up her fight with the unseen third passenger
she bangs on the door
graham and clive are bewildered by this sudden turn of events
explain to me how something as complicated as the human eye simply comes into being
oh dont give me that old irreducible complexity crap they eye is comprised of three interacting parts
remove any one of them and it ceases to exist
it has the precision and delicacy of a pocket watch and when the good lord permits it works in perfect harmony with its environment
something as functionally perfect as that doesnt just occur without the intervention of a guiding hand
but it didnt just occur did it
it is the culmination of millions of years of development across countless species
what are you talking about
ruth screams and bangs the door
if he designed it why didnt he just make it one part and take the whole weekend off
nothing you can so or do can shake my belief or faith in the sure and certain knowledge that god made heaven and earth and created us all in his
stepping out of the toilet well then how do you explain me
ruths mouth hangs agape in a soundless scream her eye rolls up her hair turns white
and thats jenga
what did you do that for
i didnt do anything she fainted
she saw you
oh come on
whos gonna believe anything she says
the authorities will be on the look out for exactly this sort of thing
what a delusional one eyed god botherer
paul right now theyre going to follow any lead they can get
i didnt think of that
we could take her with us
were only going to be a couple of days
we could let her go once pauls gone home
im sure shell be fine once she gets to know us
paul and clive consider this
how am i going to get my passport back
leave it to me
the door opens seemingly by itself
paul materializes in the kitchenette and starts looking around for clives passport
he roots around noisily in drawers and cupboards until he spies his quarry on the work top
he checks the passport and finds clives absurd picture
ruth what in the lords name moses and paul come face to face
they regard each other for a second
paul burst out of the behe residence pursued by moses who is loading a shotgun
the rv start to move forward
the door swings open and graham appears beckoning to paul
paul reaches the door just as moses levels the gun at his target
paul leaps into grahams arms disappearing inside the rv as moses fires off a booming shot
the behe mailbox explodes into pieces as the rv careens off out of the trailer park
ruth wakes up
panic in her eyes
clive drives graham sits on the sofa biting his nails
where am i
paul leans round from the chewie seat and smile
hey look whos up
would you like a cup of tea
ruth starts to pray furiously
im so sorry it had to be this way ruth
were definitely not going to hurt you and well let you go as son as we can
we were just a little concerned that you might call the police
you have been deceived
deceived by an agent of satan himself
you know im sitting right here
hes not a demon ruth hes from another world and were helping him get home
hes not evil
hes just very rude
how can he be from another world
there is only one world
our world created by god the father
paul sits down next to graham
look if it makes you feel any better my existence only disproves the notion of the abrahamic judeo christian god as well as all single earth theologies
science still hasnt categorically rule out the notion of divinity even though evolutionary biology suggest the non existence of a creator by probability alone
how could that possibly make me feel any better
jesus christ i was just trying to be nice
i think what pauls trying to say is just because there are other inhabited planets its not the end of the world
this isnt happening
youre a hallucination
youre not real
youre a test
a test from god
you cant win can you
ruth starts to pray furiously speaking in tongues making an awful noise
i cant drive like this
well have to drop her off and take our chances
oh for gods sake
paul walks over to ruth and places his and across her forehead
he appear to go into a trance
ruths eyes roll up into her head
we see a lightening montage of images
the cosmos the surface of a planet others like paul pauls ship crashing into the ground
the images speed up as paul telepathically send his knowledge into ruths mind
they collapse in a heap on the floor
paul sparks up a cigarette
what did you do to her
i broadened her horizons
can you broaden mine
no its tiring
graham goes over to where paul is lying
come here then
paul puts his hand on grahams head
grahams eyes go all fluttery
we dont see the images this time
everyone knows the secrets of the universe apart from me
he always knew what was going on in buffy before me because his mum had cable
cant i just tell you
paul sighs then with enormous effort reaches up and zaps clive who falls to the floor
everyone lays inert
maybe i should make that tea
three black sedans are parked in the behe rv park
i didnt call the government
i called the po lice
given your description of the intruder the police felt your call was perhaps better directed to us
and who are you
secret service sir
i knew it
you know that devil took my ruth
and ruths your daughter
her mama died when she was born
i good as brought her up by myself
wasnt easy either
two mouths to feed and this place to run
do you have a photography of ruth mr
moses retrieves an old cigar box and produces a tattered photograph of ruth
she appears younger with both eyes intact and with dark hair
do you have a phone mr
in case she tries to contact you
zoil nods at haggard who immediately starts dialling on his satellite phone moving into a different room
and shell call me if she can
ruths never really been outta carbon county
you say they went east
theyll have to get off the after flaming gorge if they aint using the interstate theres been a rig spill just south of dutch john
so that means theyll be on the
only way to go
zoil looks at oreilly
tell me youre gonna kill that thing mr
kill it for what it is
well do our best mr
watch yourself now
i seen its eyes
zoil haggard and oreilly leave
moses watches them
gods speed mr
zoils radio crackles to life
man that way was one fat freak
if i was that girl i think id rather take my chances with the alien
haggard and oreilly hoot with laughter
can it you two
how many times do i have to tell you
moses is sat at his kitchen table listening to his police scanner
haggard and oreillys laughter rattles loudly over the radio
we do not refer to the target as the alien
mosess expression is mixture of fury and disbelief
he glances at something nearby
pull focus to the shotgun lying in the foreground on the kitchen table
we hear an engine splutter into life revving furiously
moses in his pick up truck screams off in pursuit
close on paul
he is staring at something in wonder
pull out to reveal him sitting next to graham and clive looking out through the rvs windshield
we see their pov
a breathtaking panorama of natural beauty
they are parked up at the summit of a mountain road looking out across the vista
there it is boys
is that where were going
i gotta tell ya
its at times like these you winder if the intelligent design crowd arent onto something
i mean look at it
hey ruth get up here
they look round the door of the rv is open ruth is gone
someone should go after her
clive looks round to see graham gone
ruth is storming up the road
leave me alone
ruth please stop ive got shin splints
graham catches up to her
are you alright
he cant be from space
its not possible
ruth you saw for yourself
its not just possible its probably
theres probably millions of intelligent civilizations
so where is everybody
well one of them is right there
ruth and graham look back at the rv
paul is stood on the dashboard with his bare buttocks pressed against the window
clive is trying not to laugh
everything ive ever been told is a lie
do you know how that feels
to suddenly have nothing
just because your truth wasnt the truth it doesnt mean there is no truth ruth
i understand youre probably feeling very confused right now
religious belief systems are devised to give us context and security
to stop us feeling lonely and unimportant
i do feel lonely and unimportant
how can this all be an accident
it doesnt make sense
did you know the reason we have solar eclipses is because the sun is exactly times bigger than the moon and the moon is exactly times closer to the earth
graham considers saying yes but decides against it
how can that be an accident
it isnt its a coincidence
or it probably is
thats the beauty of the universe
but whats the point
if theres nothing afterwards whats the point in living
this is the point ruth
that tree your next cheeseburger
life is a miracle
people spend so much time focusing on rescuing the princess they forget how much fun it is to fight the dragon
carl sagan said a religion old or new that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and
awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths
its okay not to know ruth
its wonderful because it means we still have things to learn
we still have life to live
so am i but it passes sort of
ruth were on an amazing adventure and i think you should come with us
i know you feel confused and lost but if you get back on board that rv you might just find the very thing youre looking for
im not sure
im sure ruth
im sure because i can honestly say i have never talked to a woman for this long without blushing
thats so sweet
graham blushes deep dark red
graham and ruth get back onto the rv
graham looks pleased with himself
shes going to be fine
i think your hair looks good by the way
you look like storm
from x men
ruth goes to the bathroom
the rv drives across the rugged countryside
graham clive ruth and paul appear in various combinations
graham drives with paul in the chewie seat clive sleeps on the sofa ruth can be seen sitting on the bed at the back
clive drives with graham in the chewie seat
paul just behind ruth on the sofa
she is staring at paul
paul turns round she looks away
paul drives clive sits in the chewie seat graham and ruth just behind
the rv weaves from side to side
everyone else is asleep
we see zoils convoy
zoil drives his eyes intent on the road searching
he reaches down out of shot then brings a taco to hi mouth and takes a bit
a truck passes
we see haggard in his car talking animatedly on his cell phone
the truck passes
we see oreilly in his car he is asleep at the wheel
the truck passes horn blaring
oreilly wakes up suddenly looking rattled
the rv is parked up
it is a little speck on an enormous landscape
next to the highway is a sign which reads you are now leaving utah
underneath this a separate sign reads leaps back and forth over the line
oclock oclock oclock oclock oclock
we see clive graham and ruth standing in the middle of the road watching paul
this is the furthest ive ever been
zoils convoy pulls into an arbys
the three agents leap out of their cars and run in
after a short pause moses behes pick up truck passes through shout onward christian soldiers blares from the radio
graham drives clive sits in the chewie seat
paul hangs back
ruth emerges from the bedroom
she has swapped her darwin t shirt for one of grahams
its an x files t shirt emblazoned with a ufo and the legend i want to believe
you dont mind do you graham
it looks nice
hey we should stop for something to eat
are you hungry ruth
whats new fatty
hey its not fat its power
i happen to be very strong
paul summons a phlegm ball with a grotesque snort and spits it onto the floor of the rv
pick that up then
maybe i should call papa
look ive been missing for a whole day
if hes called the police theyll be looking for us and if they find us this amazing adventure is going to come to an end real quick
i just need to tell him im fine and that ill be back soon okay
paul offers up a high five to ruth
right up top
ruth yelps terrified that paul is going to zap her again
clive reaches down and picks up pauls phlegm ball
i did it
graham clive and ruth step out of the rv
okay in and out yes
dont talk to anyone unless you have to and try to look inconspicuous
angle on the most conspicuous threesome in america
i wish hed stop doing that
they enter the bar
parked nearby is a black lincoln escalade shiny mean dented
the bar is very busy
scantily clad waitresses serve a variety of customers
people play pool other people dance to a small band
ruth spies a pay phone at the back
i wont be long
well order food and wait for you at the bar
ruth walks through to the back past the toilets
as she passes moses behe steps out of the mens they miss each other by moments
he walks up to the bar next to graham and clive who are looking at a menu
she listens nervously
please hold your call is being diverted
agent zoil secret service
listen very carefully
youre in great danger
how did you
we know who youre travelling with ruth
i need you and your friend to turn yourselves in
what if we dont want to turn ourselves in
zoil talks on a satellite phone
haggard works on a laptop nearby
oreilly listens in
where are you
where are you headed
i dont know
look i know you think youre doing the right thing but i promise you im only thinking about you
you care about paul dont you
i dont know how i feel about him
hes weird and also rude
yes he is
i asked him why he wore shorts and he said if he didnt id see his big spaceman balls
loud giggles followed by angry shushing from zoil
whos there with you
ruth please listen to me
your father is worried about you
we want to get you home
i need you to tell me where you are
he showed me things
youre not still talking about his balls are you
i just want to know whats real
her expression shows great conflict
ruth panics and slams down the phone
she realizes what she may have done and rushes back toward the bar slamming into two men
the meatheads drunk look down at her amused
hey slow down there cyclops
i need to get to my friends
why the hurry
you know i got a friend with one eye whod love to meet you
i happen to have two eyes actually
i just have a severe stigmatism
you should get that fixed up
reckon youd be kinda pretty in the right light
yeah the dark
papa said the lord would fix it
the lord aint gonna fix nothing sweetheart
ruth plants her knee firmly into the groin of gus
he doubles up knocking his friend over
graham and clive are clutching brown paper bags full of food ruth returns from the phone
hows your dad
we need to leave now
were still waiting on a wet fries
the two meatheads emerge from the pay phone
its the space faggots that dinged the fuck mobile
look im terribly sorry
perhaps we can exchange insurance details
im sorry i dont speak nerd
graham and clive look terribly offended
these the friends you told us about baby
yes they are
well whaddya know
we were just leaving
i dont think so
jake grabs ruth
graham pushes him hard in the chest
leave her alone
what did you say
timid but resolute he said leave her alone
at this jake pulls his fist back to hit clive knocking a tray of drinks all over a table full of men
they immediately spring up and lunge after the meatheads who turn their attention to the attack
the fight spreads like fire
graham grabs ruths hand and follows clive as he scrambles through the fracas
as they reach the door ruth is yanked back and comes face to face with her father
im taking you home
dont talk back to me girl
a chair smashes across mosess head knocking him out
behind him bloodied and angry are the two meatheads
clive graham and ruth explode out of the bar and run toward the rv
the meatheads crash out after them
what about papa
hey we aint finished with you
graham take ruth into the rv and lock the door
i dont want either of you to see this
clive turns back to the meatheads
clive is struck in the face he falls nose bleeding
they turn to ruth and graham who back up against the rv
the meatheads approach ominously
the rv door bursts open
paul stands silhouetted against the interior lights
the meatheads freeze
paul vanishes then reappears a few feet from them their eyes bulge
so who wants to get probed first
the meatheads swoon and simultaneously hit the deck
only one of us fainted
tell me you got the food
clive gets up and opens his coat revealing bags of food
sirens wail in distance
ruth turns white
it wasnt my fault
they answered the phone
he knew all about us
who are you talking about
get in the rv
the rv roars to life backing up at speed into the meatheads vehicle
moses behe bursts out of the bar just as the rv passes
ruth sees him out of the window
moses locks eye with his daughter
he runs to his pick up but realises he doesnt have his keys
the rv tears off into the night leaving moses behe bellowing with anger and the lincoln escalade shiny mean fucked
the rv pulls off the road into a secluded lay by
the gang sit in silence for a while
was that your dad ruth
he was so angry
hes always angry
graham clive and paul all exchange looks
are you alright ruth
ruth nods still distant
im feeling pretty amped up
anyone wanna take a walk
you want to come for a walk ruth
thanks but i think im going to turn in
its been a long day what with meeting you guys being abducted by and alien and having my whole belief system called into question
sorry about that
it was amazing though wasnt it
remember when paul said yo fucknuts
that was brilliant
you gotta talk the talk right
what about when i got smacked in the nose
yeah yeah snorlax youre a real hero
you want anything ruth
no you go ill be fine
ruth hands clive her handkerchief
it is embroidered with the words jesus saves
he mops his nose as they leave the rv
you can sleep in my bunk if youd like
she smiles at him
he goes to leave but turns back
id use a pen to push the tissues off the bed
ive had a cold
graham and paul stand outside a liquor store on the main drag of a quiet town
next door is a western themed clothing store
paul looks in the window
check this out
what dya think
paul indicates to a small cowboy outfit big enough for a child displayed in the window
id look pretty hot right
steve miller band
i love that song
speaking of midnight tokers i got a littler herbal refreshment in my pants
do you guys partake
i get it from the military
this is the shit that killed dylan
bob dylans still alive
clive comes out of the liquor store clutching bags of beer
graham clive and paul have made a camp fire in a woodland clearing on the other side of town
they sit round drinking beers and chatting
paul rolls a joint
so why paul
its not very you know alien
is it spelt like p a w l l or something
p o o u r l
no its paul
like paul newman or the little guy from simon and garfunkel
pauls not my real name
its a name i got given
whats your real name
you wont be able to pronounce it
i can speak klingon
what a geek
come on whats your real name
paul opens his mouth and screeches
thats pretty good
that sounds like roger
calm down rog
he lights his joint
you look like a poster on a students wall
that was my gag
take me to your dealer right
yeah that was mine
never saw a dime
you never answered my question
who called you paul
the little girl who found me when i crashed
it was terrible actually
i killed her dog
i didnt mean to
my ship sort of landed on it
when the military arrived i was delirious i kept saying paul
it was the only english i knew because id heard the little girl saying it over and over
spooks thought it was my name
she called her dog paul
least it wasnt mr
what happened to the little girl
never saw her again
think about her everyday though
paul offers the joint round
clive and graham decline
paul takes a deep drag
during the following exchange graham clive and paul start to move simultaneously as though governed by some kind of psychic link
its strange isnt it
ordinarily in this situation graham and i would be looking up at the stars wondering about life on other planets but we know now dont we
its a bit of an anti climax
thanks a bunch hurley
i dont mean that in a bad way
they all scratch their noses
paul can i ask you something
why are you in such a hurry to leave
ive outlived my usefulness
theres only so much knowledge i can share about the universe and quantum theory and how to make a really nice meatball sandwich
the only thing i have to offer them now are my abilities
so the only way theyre going to get hold of them is by obtaining some of somatic stem cells
so what do they take a swab from your cheek
sadly not that simple
oh my god i hate needles
believe me a needle would be a picnic compared to what they had in store for me
i dont follow
stem cells are multipotent
graham and clive look blank
graham and clive still look blank
the camouflage response the memory transfer the revivification they all originate in my cerebellum
in order to cultivate them in a laboratory they would have to
cut your brain out
fortunately someone was kind enough to give me the heads up if youll pardon the pun
so when they were transferring me to the medical facility and i noticed the bumper sticker on your rv i figured you might be sympathetic types
i zapped the spooks grabbed the wheel and took my chance
i thought the crash was our fault
well it was kinda
so youre saying if they catch you
paul draws his thumb across his neck
graham and clive look at paul in horror
all three scratch their heads
so tell me are you guys virgins or what
they all cough
alright then clive when was the last time you got laid
three years ago you had sex with a midget
she was an ewok
there are only two types of person small enough to fit inside an ewok costume
she was a midget
i cant believe you thought boning a space bear sounded less embarrassing than a person of short stature
was it nice
you sly dog
paul rolls onto his back clapping
graham snorts into his beer laughing
clive joins in
before long the three friends are rolling around in hysterics utterly out of control
after about thirty seconds of this they pass out
the sun has just risen
graham clive and paul lie round the smoldering camp fire sleeping soundly
paul is very white
his eyes open
he looks around
hey wake up
we fell asleep
how did that happen
sorry i get this thing when i get high
its called projective empathy
you feel what i feel
like in e
oh thank god
for a second there i thought id got drunk on lite beer
the guys gather their stuff and walk to the edge of the wood
looking through the tree line they realize that the quiet town of last night has become very busy indeed
i cant walk through there
how are we going to get back
close in on graham having the best idea of his life
graham and clive walk down the busy main street between them is paul
he is dressed in the little cowboy suit from the shop window his hat pulled down low over his face
maybe we should hold hands so that we look like a family
two grown men who look like sex offenders holding hands with a child cowboy
you could be a midget
youre obsessed with midgets
they continue on trying to look as if nothing is strange
seem to be working clive
graham notices that clive is no longer with them
he looks back to see clive gawping thought the window of a comic shop at a sword resembling the one they saw at comic con
the tag reads genuine blade katana
clive walks into the shop
graham and paul follow quickly behind
as they enter the comic shop moses behe emerges from the adjacent drug store
he takes a couple of pain killers and flexes his sore shoulders
he wanders up the road scanning the passers by
graham approaches clive who is at the counter
nows not really the time sausage
i must have it
its very cheap
are you sure you dont want to save up and get a proper on
oh come on weve got time
close on ruths watch
she paces worried
where have you been
i was worried
she opens the door
agent zoil flashes his badge
good morning maam
sorry to trouble you
agent zoil secret service
your wagon here matches the description of a recreational vehicle were currently looking for
may i ask are you alone
ruth pauses a second
yes im alone
do you mind taking a look at these pictures
zoil pulls out three pictures and hands them to ruth
cctv shots of graham and clive at the gas station and mosess pic of ruth looking younger with dark hair and no glasses
do you recognise any of these people miss
she lingers on the picture of herself
no sorry i dont
where are you coming from maam
christian ministry in seattle
ive been driving for days
it has an impressive bat population you know
folks gather by the rive in the evening to watch them fly out
turn the sky black
quite a sight
is that so
well i really should be getting along
thanks for your time miss
darwin charlotte darwin
zoil smiles and nods
graham and clive are at the counter
clive is trying out the blade
paul in cowboy guise browses the racks of comics
he picks one up
the cover features an alien that looks a lot like him
the comic is called encounter briefs tales from the dreamland
paul smiles and shakes his head
he suddenly realises he is being watched
next to him is a child small enough to see under pauls hat
he is looking at the cover of the comic and back at paul
hows it going
is that you
it looks like you
suppose it does
whats your name
pleased to meet you
they shake hands
you on your own here keith nash
my moms shopping for some new jeans
she lets me wait in here
sounds like a good mum
yes and no
whatre you doing here
my friends buying a sword
hes a grown man
what a nerd
so does keith nash
you an m ms man keith
paul produces his m ms
he offers one to keith
i am but i shouldnt
strangers with candy right
well weve got a lot in common
we both like comics and m ms
guess that makes us pals
keith beams at paul and takes a few m ms
they turn their attention back to the racks of comics
paul pulls one out called g men
on the cover it shows an agent not unlike zoil shooting an alien not unlike paul
you read this one
its a good one
its a gift
keith stuffs it down his trousers
we hear mrs
nash calling from the street
i gotta go
catch you later keith nash
graham and clive approach
clive has a long sword shaped box under his arm and a big grin on his face
who was that
how much was that
its made of a low grade turkish alloy
what did you get speccy
x men action figure
graham clive and paul exit the comic shop
paul waves to keith nash who now sits outside on a bench with his mother
the boys walk up the street seconds later haggard and oreilly step out of a store eating bags of candy
dont lie keith
im not lying
oh come on now keith
if you carry on like this youll have to come with me to dress barn
honestly mommy he was an alien and his name was paul
whoever hard of an alien called paul
haggard is suddenly kneeling at keith nashs side
oreilly stands nearby
what did you say kid
who are you
agent haggard maam secret service
he was in the shop
is he still in there
keith shakes his head
did he say where he was going
keith looks at his comic
the zoil style agent shooting the paul style alien
he looks back at haggard and points him in the entirely wrong direction
toward new mexico huh
haggard stands his mind racing
he looks meaningfully at oreilly not noticing the rv rumbling up the street behind him with clive at the wheel
weve got him man
were going to get a fucking promotion
you did good kid
want a candy
the two agents rush off
what about zoil
moses behe kicks at the remains of the campfire
he bends down and picks something up
it is ruths handkerchief now stained with dirt and blood
he screws it into his shaking hand
an engine roars
he looks up to see the rv rumbling up the road
it turns onto the eastbound highway
moses pick up is parked about yards away
moses starts to lumber towards it as fast as he can which isnt very fast
haggard and oreilly sprint up to their vehicles
where the hell do you think youre going
haggard cant hide his frustration
we picked up a lead sir
little kid in the town said he saw an alien
said he was heading toward new mexico
and you were just gonna take off
thought it best to take the initiative sir
we were going to radio you
well now thats mighty civil of you
we have a chain of command
i expect you to abide by it
where dyou say he was headed
new mexico sir
well then lets move it
oh and haggard
dont go getting ideas about your station again
zoil gets into his car leaving haggard looking pissed
moses drives ruths bloody handkerchief gripped between his hands and the wheel
he listens to his police scanner
zoil what the hells going on
theyve double back sir
theyre heading toward new mexico
you better be right about this zoil
im getting a little tired of this shit
i want that little fuckers brain in a jar by sundown
moses smiles darkly
looks like youre going the wrong way agent zoil
thats what happens when you dont got the lord on your side
moses behes pick up roars through shot revealing a large roadside sign proclaiming lucifers cut price firework warehouse
creep in on the sign
the rv is parked outside the firework warehouse
ruth and paul sit opposite each other at the dining table
ruth is holding the x men action figure storm
paul watches her
he likes you yknow
what are you blind
what you got there a stigmatism
you know you can get on operation for that right
papa said the lord would fix it
guess thats not gonna happen seeing as were living in a gigantic godless universe with no hope of salvation
hey i dont know categorically that its godless
i just said probably
oh thats a relief
look the way youre feeling now thats why religion appeared in the first place
its like existential prozac
imagine being five year sold and having no adults around to tell you why it snows or what trees are for
thats how it is for much of humanity
faith is a night light
it illuminates the scary corners fills the gaps makes the universe easier to comprehend
thing is its okay not to know everything
i mean who knows whats really out there
did you know astrophysicists recently identified the equation for the creation of matter
well then you get it right
if they have the theory whos to say at some point in the future they wont put it into practice and whos to say someone else didnt do that
billion years ago and thats how the universe came to be
course then we get the eternal problem of who created the creator but thats a whole other car park
i think shakespeare said it best
theres more in heaven and earth than is dreamt of in your philosophy horatio
what did you call me
its from hamlet
you know the prince of denmark
denmark has a municipal population of
anyway if there is a god didnt he create doctors and hospitals and scalpels and shit so he wouldnt have to go round fixing peoples lazy eyeballs
i suppose so
the eye is a delicate and complex thing ruth
you should get it taken care of
paul smiles back
ruth looks out of the window just as paul reaches out to touch her face
paul withdraws his hand
graham and clive are approaching the rv clutching a large firework
they climb aboard
what are you going to do with this
zoil jumps but gathers his composure quickly
satellites come up with a data analysis on all the traffic coming out of prospect in the last hours
there was only one rv and guess what nimrod
it wasnt going to new mexico
thats a three pointer agent zoil
you better spin your ass around
you got some serious catching up to do
dont make me come out there
where are they headed
if we gun it maybe we can get the drop on their destination
theyre on the heading towards gillette
what else is around there
thunder basis bethlehem creek
zoils motorcade pulls a spectacular u turn and heads back up the highway in the opposite direction
moses listens intently to his scanner
you dont think shes sill there do you
moses behes pick up truck pulls a similarly spectacular turn and heads in a different direction
caption bethlehem creek wyoming graham clive ruth and paul stare through the window of the rv at the farmhouse glimpsed in the first scene
you dont think shes still there do you
thats what youre going to find out for me
i cant just knock can i
what if shes moved on and someone else answers
im sick of people fainting on me
ill hang back with my buddy ruth you two make first contact
just enjoy it
what shall we say if its her
were here with the alien that killed your dog sixty years ago
hurry up theres going to be a really big storm in exactly minutes
how do you know
its my job to know
graham knocks on the door
leave me alone
graham goes to leave
clive stops him
miss walton im the writer clive gollings and this is my friend and colleague graham willy
were from england and were here with the alien that killed your dog years ago
the sound of multiple locks
the door opens to reveal a woman
grey dishevelled but with fire in her eyes
she scowls at graham and clive
what is this some kind of joke
its no joke
paul materializes between graham and clive
taras faces sickens
she falls backwards into the house
graham clive ruth and paul all sit on a sofa
tara sits opposite staring at paul
maybe i should make some tea
where are my manners
i never really have guests
nobody comes up here
i go whole weeks without seeing a soul
tara goes to the kitchen
she can be seen from where they are sitting
she turns the gas on and strikes a cooking match
paul looks pained struggling for something to say
can i do anything to help
tara stand in the kitchen doorway the lit match in her hand
paul stands and walks toward her she watches him
ive only just stopped believing in you yknow
spent a very long time trying to convince folk about what happened that night
my parents my friends
everyone thought i was mad
they told me it was a meteor that squashed little paul
took me away and did tests they did said it was for cosmic radiation
they said i was concussed hallucinating but i knew you were real
i pulled you from that spaceship myself
sat with you till the men came and took you away
if pop hadnt had to go to casper he would have seen you too
they kept telling me id imagined it but i knew different
pop tried to understand but they filled his head with delayed this and post traumatic that
he just used to smile and say there there tara
he got sick when i was seventeen and died a few years later
i inherited this place
word got out about my story not long after it happened so i didnt really have any friends
kids used to throw stones at the house and call me names
i just kinda retreated into myself
id spend whole nights up on the roof staring at the sky hoping to catch a glimpse of you again
i always believed that one day you d come back and here you are
the match flame reaches her fingers she shakes it out
listen to me gabbing
milk and sugar
im so sorry
for killing your dog and ruining your life
that doesnt matter
dont you see
i was right and all those folk that said i was crazy
well they can all go fuck themselves
its good to see you tara
the tinkle of glass
something hits the floor
a tear gas canister spins at their feet spewing thick fog
now where do you suppose that came from
fuck a duck
tara wheres the back door
the gang bustle out of the room just as the front door splinters inward revealing oreilly in a gas mask
the gang quickly barricade the door of the next room and continue on toward the back of the house
they find the back door just as it is opened by zoil
the gang freeze
paul vanishes then reappears right next to zoil putting his hand across zoils forehead
paul wait a burst of psychic images explode into zoils head
the agent and the alien fall on the ground in an exhausted heap
a little help
clive picks paul up
haggard approaches gun drawn
freeze space monkey
were cut off
tara opens a nearby door and motions them down some stairs as haggard fires wildly
crockery explodes around them
the gang descend into a dim room
it is full of ufo paraphernalia
models toys books souvenirs from every ufo hot spot in the land
one the wall is the take me to your dealer poster
paul sees it
not a fucking cent
zoil comes to
he sees haggard at the cellar door
screeching brakes draw his attention as moses behes truck skids up
he gets out shotgun in hand
team paul climb out of the cellar and start to run towards the rv paul still in clives arms
it starts to rain
ow my shins
zoil sees moses run round to the front of the farmhouse
help me up
oreilly sees team paul running toward the rv from the front room
he levels his pistol at paul and squints
team paul reach the rv and start to board just as moses behe lumbers into view
paul grabs ruths hand
levelling his shotgun take your hands off her devil
oreilly find his mark
pull back to reveal he is stood by the kitchen door through which we see the cooker the simmer of gas in the air
ready or not
oreilly is vaporized in a ball of orange fire
the farmhouse explodes
zoil and haggard who are only just clear hit the deck covering their heads
moses is knocked off his feet as flaming wood and debris rain down
the rv roars into life reversing out onto the road
clive pulls a spectacular u turn sending the passengers flying
graham lands in taras arms ruth in pauls
ruth and graham exchange glances
tara straightens herself and looks out of the rv at her destroyed home
zoil is blackened and dazed draped over haggards shoulder
his eyes focus on a figure in the near distance
moses behe picks himself up and lumbers off towards his truck
haggard drops zoil and runs to his car
damnit haggard wait
haggard takes off
zoil staggers to his car and with great difficulty takes off in pursuit narrowly avoiding moses behes truck
clive floors it
rain lashes down
the sky is almost black
your dads persistent isnt he
you have no idea
clive sees their pursuers in his wing mirror
i think we have a problem
what do we do
clive hauls the wheel left
the rv leaves the road and bounces across the scrub
team paul hang on for dear life
haggard zoil and moses follow the rv across the scrub
what the hell is he doing
sir i in pursuit sir
who the hell is this
agent zoil has been compromised
im assuming command
now wait a goddamn minute
i dont give a shit whos in command
where my fucking mooncoon
just ahead of me sir
were heading east across scrubland just north of mitchell creek
i dont wanna hear from either of you jokers until that little mother fucker is under glass
haggard floors it
he is manic and wild eyed
we see the chase from above the rv is in the lead gaining behind them is haggard followed by zoil then moses
haggard draws level
he looks up into clives eyes
theyre trying to overtake
dont let him get past
shall i ram him
clive wrenches the wheel hard to the left
the rv nudges the black sedan which spins out of control and skids to a stop zoil and moses scream past
haggard turns the engine over
lightening explodes overhead hail pings and bounces off the hood
what are we doing exactly
immense pressure and temperature drop
high winds circulating in the troposphere two opposed fronts clashing
oh this is going to be a good one
ruth stares out of the window
oh my god
a massive black funnel extends from the sky about half a mile ahead of the chase
it rakes the ground reducing a small farm building to a million splinters
zoil is sat mouth agape
clive swerves to avoid a grain silo which comes bouncing across the ground toward them
are you sure you know what youre doing
paul well get sucked right up
stay on target
a branch smacks on the windshield cracking it
stay on target
the grain silo bounces close to zoils car he swerves to avoid it and stops
moses pulls up just ahead
moses and zoil get out of the vehicles almost unable to stand against the wind and debris
they watch the rv now a good distance in front heading for the heart of the tornado
haggards car screams past
zoil grabs his radio
haggard stand down
i can do this
haggard its suicide
the funnel suddenly evaporates into the sky leaving the path ahead clear and oddly calm
where did it go
zoil watches amazed
he almost smiles
son of a bitch
zoil looks at the sky
his face drops
wait a minute
an engine revs nearby
zoil turns to see moses behe pull off in pursuit
into is radio damnit hang back hang back
youre not running this show any more zoil
you had your chance
haggard he knows what hes doing
so do i
its a trap
theyre still coming
ruth why dont you count back from
back where im from tornadoes are part of our daily life
weve learnt how to live with them how to understand them
weve learnt to anticipate their behavior know their personalities know when theyre playing games
hide and seek
clive looks into his wing mirror just as the tornado snakes down out of the sky between them and haggard
great caesars ghost
how did you do that
how did you know
the tornado touches down hear haggards car
he barely has time to scream before his is lifted into the vortex
a wide eyed moses yanks hard on the wheel spinning the truck round heading back in the opposite direction
mosess truck hurtles past zoils car
zoil looks back toward the no unreachable rv
weve lost them
team paul erupt into cheers
paul jumps in the air and whoops
he high five graham and pats clive on the back
graham embraces ruth and tries to kiss her she pulls away
wait what about papa
i only saw one car following us
tara comes out of the toilet
the bulbs gone in there
that was just awesome
amazing driving clive
it was like g
but potentially fatal
wasnt it clive
a knocking and a gurgling sound is coming from the engine
the rv splutters to a halt
steam rises from the radiator
it whines coughs and dies
cut to team paul stood around surveying their fallen companion
a single bullet hold in the grill reveals the cause of her downfall
there goes the deposit
fare thee well friend
you were a faithful and mighty steed
she rode that storm with a bullet in her heart and didnt stop until we were safe
if there is a benevolent creator watching over everything then may he she or it bless the holiday rambler imperial
everyone looks to paul for his comment but he is not there
paul is stood away from the rv at the foot of a small hill
he starts to climb
the others follow
crane up as team paul climb the hill to reveal a sight familiar to anyone who has seen close encounters of the third kind
devils tower of course
scanning the landscape
what the hell is going on
we got hit by a twister sir
what about the other one
i lost him when the ranch exploded
jesus christ zoil this has been one fuck up after another
i should have handled it myself
i want that little bastard dead by midnight tonight or youll be working security in a convention centre
now wheres that rv
zoils eyes widen
parked on the roadside is the rv
zoil is staring at devils tower
team paul hike towards the tower
what you may not know is on the outside of the tower they bolted a series of ladders all the way to the top put there by william rogers in
he was the first man to climb the tower
i climbed up there in
thought it would make a good site for some ufo spotting
turns out i wasnt the only one
we call them ifos
i thank you
zoil opens the trunk of his car
he pulls out a large piston spare ammo and a webbing pack which he slings around his shoulder
he sets off up the hill
team paul are walking round the tower
as they round the corner the landscape changes the trees give way to a piece of open pasture flanked by pine forest the tower opens itself up slightly a perfect
this is it
paul takes out the firework zippo and cigarettes from his back pack
he lights his last cigarette and takes a drag
ill miss these
paul takes the firework a little way off and sticks it in the ground
he crouches down and lights the touch paper with the cigarette then scampers back to the gang
the firework rises into the sky
the star burst is massive and bright red it illuminates the tower
a light appears in the sky some way off
that was quick
zoil runs through the bush fast like a wild animal
his face fixed with serious intent gun in one hand torch in the other
team paul watch as the ethereal light draws nearer
spotlights cut through the night searching beneath
zoil leaps a fallen tree
ahead through the trees he sees an ethereal glow
he pulls the slide back on his pistol
the lights are really close now
they are accompanied by a deep rumble
a very earthly sound
wait a minute
a helicopter swoops in to land kicking dust and debris into the air
team paul turn back to the woods but are stopped by the sight of a torch getting nearer
behind them the helicopter powers down
the door opens
well whaddya know
voice appears flanked by two faceless heavily armed soldiers
they level their weapons just as zoil bursts through the trees behind them
paul spins round
we go into slow motion
the bullet explodes from the gun straight at us
angle on the bullet as it passes in ecu
the shot moves round behind the bullet to reveal paul looking shocked
the bullet whizzes past him slamming into one of the soldiers
zoil rolls coming to rest on one knee
he fires a second shot into the leg of the other soldier who collapses
he leaves his gun at voice just as the pilot bursts from the cockpit
the pilot fires but misses zoil
zoil takes out his shoulder spinning him off his feet
voice steps forward holding a smoking gun
it was you
you told him
i shouldve known
youve never made a mistake in your life
thats why i put you in charge of this fucking mission
hes my friend
ive known him for twenty years
he introduced me to my wife damnit
you stupid son of a bitch
in five years you could have been where i am
i dont want to be where you are
too bad seeing as im the one holdng all the cards and when i say cards i of course mean big fucking gun
voice points his gun at paul
howd you find me
it was pretty easy once we got a fix on the geek mobile
wasnt hard to figure out where you were headed
you always did have a flare for the dramatic
paul nods a sad smile creeping across his mouth
tara stands in front of paul then ruth then graham then clive who summons every ounce of bravery in his body
hes not going anywhere
be honest with yourself two scoops
what is it that you think you can possibly bring to the table at this stage in the game
clive reaches beyond his back and produces his katana sword he holds it like a proud samurai
the blade falls off
bloody low grade turkish alloy
step aside you fat nerd
graham his this man
clive steps aside
graham slams his fist into the face of the unsuspecting voice
he staggers back but rallies quickly blocking grahams second blow and delivering a heavy rebuke
ruth leaps onto voices back and starts pummeling his head
leave him alone
voice hits out at ruth
graham renews his attack
leave her alone
voice throws them off and comes face to face with tara
leave them alone
she whacks voice across the face with a large stick
youre not taking him away again
he staggers backwards and falls to the ground unconscious
thank you tara
dont mention it
paul rushes to zoil who lies on the ground wounded
the things i do for you huh
you know i appreciate it
do you have any idea how difficult it was to catch you guys
let me take a look at that
ruth shine the torch down here
ruth grabs a torch and steps in behind paul
ruth lurches forward suddenly limp
everyone turns to see moses behe shotgun smoking in his and
his face white his eyes wide
oh lord ruth
my little ruth
graham gathers ruth up in his arms
she coughs flecks of blood around her mouth
i never meant to shoot her
i was aiming for the goblin
hes not a goblin hes from another planet
but he cant be
hes an alien you stupid man
oh ruth ruth im sorry im so sorry
i should have never persuaded you to come with us
ruth focuses on graham
she smiles weakly
what and miss all this
graham ive lived more in the last hours that i ever did in that trailer park
isnt that what you said living was all about
my next cheeseburger
im not afraid anymore graham
im cold though
hey where is everybody
ruth shudders and dies
tara and zoil look aghast
graham buries his head in ruths hair
clive his eyes are filled with tears puts his and on grahams shoulder
what have i done
im so sorry
a shadow is cast across ruth
everyone looks up to see paul silhouetted against the moon
his eyes glint
there is no way this thing isnt gonna end happy
paul drops to his knee and places his hands on ruths chest
moses drops his shotgun and lumbers over distraught
get away from her
dont you touch my little girl
clive holds out a hand to stop moses
the air hums charged with static
pauls skin ripples with color
everyone watches transfixed
ruths eye flickers and opens
with some difficulty she sits up and takes off her glasses
she blinks both shining healthy eyes
ruth are you okay
i think so
is anyone hungry
i really feel like a cheese burger
relief and joy spreads through group
moses falls to his knees and sobs
he feels a hand on his shoulder and looks up to see paul
ruth and graham hug
she smiles at him
you can kiss me now
they kiss with awkward passion
everyone smiles then after a bit become uncomfortable and a bit grossed out
looks like the geek shall inherit the earth
the group turn to see voice upright pointing his gun
i wouldnt say a large spaceship lands hard on top of voice
everyone looks shocked
paul graham and clive exchange a look
happens to the best of us
some time has passed a number of paul style aliens are now present
one of them uses a big hose to clean the remains of voice from the hull of the ship
another two help the now healed soldier to their feet patting them on the back and shaking their hands
the atmosphere is amiable
team paul look at one another
zoil and moses have joined them
paul kisses and hugs ruth
im sorry i frightened you so much your hair turned white
you didnt frighten me
you freed me
you helped me see the light
take care of her big man
i will sir
god be with you
they high five
paul turns to zoil whose arm is in a makeshift sling and shakes his hand
lorenzo zoil youre a good man
say bye to karen for me
safe trip short round
paul turns to graham and clive
he pulls jelva alien queen of the varvak from his pocket and hands it to them
you can keep it
what did you think

although you know what
sometimes less is more
the boys nod
no thank you
you are and always will be our friend
come here you fucking geeks
he takes in incandescent orb from his pocket
this is a self sustaining light orb
might come in handy you know if a bulb goes
tara is waiting for her goodbye but paul ignores her
he face drops as he walks to his ship
he turns to her
i ruined your life tara
think i owe you a new one
tara takes pauls hand
i dont have my toothbrush
baby where were going you wont need teeth
tara frowns then follows paul aboard
paul and tara stand in the doorway
one of the other aliens comes out of a small room behind them speaking in a strange tongue
subtitle the bulbs gone in there
as the door slowly closes graham and clive give paul the ce k salute
paul gives them the finger
the boys laugh tears in their eyes
the ship lifts off into the sky
graham clive ruth moses and zoil watch them go
the light form the ship gradually fades leaving them in darkness
that was good wasnt it
we are at comic con the following year
we come to rest on a long line of people
sat behind a table are graham and clive
they look more confident cooler
clive is talking to a short woman in an ewok costume
he pats her on the ass as she walks away
all around them are stacks of their new novel paul
a banner hangs behind displaying the cover grahams own rendering of their alien friend
they sign copies
the publicist mills around looking very pleased
just one item per person please
he winks at the boys
ruth rushes up to graham she is dressed as storm from x men and pushes a customized buggy in which sits a baby dressed as professor x
im just taking tara over to the autograph pavilion
