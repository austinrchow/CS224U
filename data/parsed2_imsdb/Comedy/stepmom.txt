b b b ronald bass second revised draft previous drafts by gigi levangie elizabeth chandler jessie nelson steven rogers a billowy white screen
an alarm clock blares
as main titles begin the lovely sleeping face of rachel kelly rolls into frame
then out of it
alarm keeps blasting
back she comes pulling the sheets over her head
motionless now as we hear
the deafening silence of the alarm shutting off
rachel sits bolts upright
leaps out of the room
from the back we see that shes dressed only in a pair of mens boxers
she makes it halfway down the hall does a u turn back into the bedroom frantically yanks a robe hanging from the door taking the wall hook with her
she flings her robe on as she runs down the hall wall hook sticking out of her back
you overslept again damn it
the room looks like a but im almost year old exploded
posters of magicians on all the walls
rachel darts about the room mismatching the clothes she forgot to arrange the night before
get up get up get up
the lump under the cover doesnt move
ben youre late
im wearing a very serious face
dont make me start counting one
rachel tugs the sleeve of a shirt hanging on a chair and out comes a magicians bouquet of flowers
she pulls a dirty handkerchief out of the pocket of the shirt its an endless magicians handkerchief
dont make me say three im about to say three
a beat then three
she rips the covers off and a blow up dinosaur sleeps in bens place
ben im not kidding around
you make yourself appear this instant
a white bunny saunters across her toes
rachel screams then gathers her wits and searches under the bed under the bureau she opens the closet doors and shoving clothes aside
you might think this is funny but this is actually not funny
unseen by rachel six year old ben sits perched on the highest closet shelf knees under his chin holding his breath
his eyes gleeful as rachel frantically closes the closet door
rachel hops over the bunny navigates through strewn toys and books stubbing her baby toe
she limps in agony past a big picture of the kids with their daddy and heads towards a door with a keep out everyone
bellowing annabelle years old sits on the edge of her bed fuming all of her limbs crossed
she holds up a filthy purple tee shirt
you forgot to wash my purple shirt
i told you a hundred times it was purple day at school today
i didnt forget
i was up all night thinking about it and i concluded youre too special to look like everyone else
she grabs an orangey red tee shirt orange red
thats your color
few can carry it off
help me find your brother
you lost ben
of course not
does he look lost to you
big breath rachel smoking a cigarette and drinking a diet coke flings open pantry doors closet doors looking for ben attempting to put stone hard butter on toast at the
she glances at the clock
annabelle sits at the table in a grumpy orangey red mood
rachel hands her what was once a piece of toast
i told you
i like apple butter not butter butter
hands her an apple here
ill just eat my lunch
forgot im almost done making it
to the non existent ben alright ben you deal with the tardy you write yourself a note your daddy told you he had an important case this morning and he
had to leave early and we were aaaagggghhhh
she has opened a cupboard with a lazy susan that turns revealing ben sitting there
rachel screams again
oh my god
that is so not funny
youre really late
now get out here and have some cereal
eat in the cupboard
she hands him a bowl of sugared cereal puts two spoonfuls of instant coffee in barney cup and sticks it under the faucet
cocoa puffs on top fruit loops on the bottom
rachel grabs the bowl turn it upside down on the table reversing the order of the cereal
she sweeps it back in the bowl and quickly hands it back to him the phone rings throughout
you touched it
then have a donut no
im gonna beep daddy at work
hes badgering a witness
but you told us to starve
picking up phone hello
the ad agencys already there
im out the door
ben flings a fruit loop at her ben
knock it off
into phone its gonna go beautifully
another fruit loop damn it ben rachel runs around absentmindedly loading out leftover pizza hohos and chips
she glances at the clock again
you owe me a quarter
did you remember my egg carton
i told you i needed my egg carton for seed planting today
absolutely duncan im on top of everything
rachel takes the eggs from the fridge and dumps them accidentally missing the sink
they shatter onto the floor
she hands the empty carton to annabelle
im putting on my coat she hangs up panicked we are late
we are seriously late
which means mister ben weve got to get you dressed no
ben races away but rachel lunges and catches him
he wiggles in her arms as she struggles to change his clothes
just as she gets his bottoms off she drops his clothes in the pile of gooey eggs when we hear a loud knocking at the kitchen door
holding a half naked ben in her arms rachel looks up at
an immaculately dressed intimidatingly intel ligent utterly beautiful woman staring at her with extreme disapproval
annabelle and ben race into their mothers arms like little angels
jackie shoots a fiercely protective glare at rachel
they lock eyes
enough wattage to light up all of manhattan
jackie and the kids exit rachels building onto a bustling soho street
the kids clamber into the double parked volvo wagon
jackie still pissed climbs behind the wheel
jackie drives the children down a tree lined street in englewood new jersey
ben is banging jackies sunglasses case against the window
its really not so bad annabelle red and blue make purple
yes she does i dont care
i know you dont but if you had chrom atically you are in the purple family
jackie fishes through her purse
finds a toy airplane for ben
he stops banging her glasses case starts banging the plane
why does rachel wear daddys underpants
doesnt she have underpants of her own
i noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer perhaps rachels underpants are in there now where are your lunches
as if by rote they hold out their lunches
one is a plastic vons bag and the other a crumpled macys bag
she collects them and hands ben and annabelle two brightly colored lunch bags
annabelle sucked her thumb last night
i never do that you always lie
and slugs him
never say never its not fair to say always and no name calling
use your words
i hate when you say that
those were all words
i hate the planet uranus
terrible name for a planet
annabelle and ben look up at her curiously
i hate snails and blue cheese
hate i have lava
reflects lavas hateable
i never thought of that
i hate overly ripe bananas they make me want to throw up
i hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt
i hate the crayon burnt sienna and people who spit when they walk
jackie nods sagely
pulls up next to a school playground
i hate to say goodbye
they rub noses russian orthodox wedding kiss
they bump foreheads and elbows
ben runs toward the kindergarten playground jackie watches concerned as annabelle climbs the steps
the only orangey red dot in a sea of purple
taxi pulls up to a converted warehouse
rachel bolts out sprinting for the door
black and white fills the frame
like a checkerboard
we pull back and realize we are seeing a group of penguins waddling against a black and white backdrop
we see a white waitred in a black tuxedo holding glasses on a tray
a black model iman in a white dress glides through it all
in the center the only dash of color is rachel who has just entered and starts expertly directing the action
she calls out to her assistant cooper
cooper back the fill off i dont have enough shadow
youve got a fruit loop in your hair
you say that like i dont know that
i once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmothers head and when did that pass
theyll always hate you
theres a gene for it
duncan samuels rachels boss an elegant edgy englishman interrupts them
only forty minutes late
youre handling this promotion really well rachel
my work is everything to me
thisll never happen again
now stand back this sessions gonna make you remember why you hired me even though i wouldnt sleep with you cooper lets get these penguins dancing duncan backs off charmed
by her ballsiness
the music blares just then and a penguin juts forward and nips the model
the flash of the camera
we freeze for a second seeing the photo rachel just took
an avedonesque portrait of a model being goosed by a penguin colliding with a maitred who spills his tray and the penguins seem to be pointing and laughing uproariously
its an inspired photo
jackie and luke harrison ruggedly handsome man mid forties charming disarming and smart as they come
they sit side by side on a couch across from ruth franklin an elementary school counselor mr
harrison while change is exhilarating for adults it can be quite challenging for a child
lukes beeper beeps
he ignores it focuses on mr
i wont get that
we were talking about change
the fact that you two are remarrying obviously has annabelle overjoyed
they look at her dumbfounded and shes very excited about your move to switzerland
she said were getting remarried
suddenly a long bell rings jackie stands up startled
only a fire drill
my concern is that annabelle seems apathetic towards her work knowing shes leaving before the end of the semester
franklin were not planning on getting remarried
there is no move
trying to appear unfazed really
well then my concern for lukes beeper beeps again
they talk right over mrs
are you here
because you dont really seem here
ive got a case where theyre this close to sequestering the jury but have i answered the goddamn thing
somethings up wi
you think i didnt get that
she cuts a look at mrs
he never learned how to turn the darn thing off
does it for him
im wondering if theres anything going on at home that could be intensifying annabelles need to create this fantasy
then suddenly they both start speaking at once
ive been with someone for quite some time and didnt feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly
but after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her and the kids i might add she moved in last month
since our divorce luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids hes now living with a woman
half his age rachels not half my age
were not discussing your age
well were not discussing rachels age either
they want to be with you luke they go to your house to be with their father
jackie they come to be part of my life
rachel is part of that life
harrison i hear you talking about your life your needs but are you really in touch with what annabelle needs
suddenly fierce this man would walk thru fire for annabelle gladly any day of the week
except for last thursday when rachel forgot to pick them up jackie she was five minutes late im wondering if annabelle is responding to the underlying hostility that exists between
rachel and mrs
of course shes responding to it
you think its easy for any of us
you think its easy for jackie to watch her kids being looked after by someone who has half the experience she does
of course shes going to be hostile irrational and defensive
thank you luke
franklin doesnt quite know what to say
the bell rings
thank you mrs
they get up this has been very valuable for us
and ill have a serious talk with annabelle tonight
its wednesday night
shes at my house
ill talk to her
ill call from work
we can have a conference call
you tried that last week and we were on hold forty five minutes
and theyre out the door
you can hear the fight as it echoes down the elementary school hallway
jackie and luke exit the pleasant suburban school
head for the parking area
you ask me that counselors making a mountain out of a molehill
luke i need to switch next friday for thursday so why dont you take the weekend
pointedly that way youll be there and ill pick up monday tuesday and wednesday
but i wanted to take the kids to work with me on wednesday so ill take wednesday and you can pick up that thursday friday after soccer and saturday before
as if on automatic pilot they move in to kiss each other goodbye then stop
each takes a step back
years of hellos and goodbyes
they head their separate ways
establishing shot of jackies lovely home on its lovely street
comfortable front lawns
safe and happy
a place to grow kids dogs probably walruses even
we push toward the warm glow from within this home
jackie setting the table
annabelle recording the moment with her omnipresent video camera
i didnt say that
why would i say that
well daddy and i were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen
i dont want that to happen
why would i want that to happen
well youre telling your teachers and your friends mass hysteria
maybe youre upset that rachel moved in
im not upset
why would i be upset
look if the truth is you dont feel like talking about this right now thats fine
but dont look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me
cause there are only so many lies youre allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face
you wind up looking like
its just too horrible
well hes not president anymore so why be petty
ben enters in white gloves and jackies scarf
pick a card
jackie picks a card
it just slipped out
a beat what happens when he loves rachel more than us
that will never happen
never say never you always say that
ill bet daddys mad at me now
queen of diamonds
seven of clubs
nobodys mad we just want to talk about it
im gonna call him
annabelle daddy and i will always be there
thats one time always is always
you can call him after dinner but
annabelle runs out of the room
jackie watches her sadly
ben hits jackie hard with his magic wand
youre happy now
thank you ben
ben finds himself alone in the kitchen
he hits himself on the head hard
he begins to serve himself dinner
rachel and luke exit a neighborhood bistro
stroll down the street
irritated okay if theyre going to have sauce put something in it besides flour and chicken broth
quietly it was a veal stock i thi
well it wasnt a reduction like you do it
boiling down half a ton of bones
luke is thinking of something
shes watching that
the way you cook
if you could make love id marry you
softly we have to talk
happy uh oh
i mention marriage all of a sudden
ominous nazi baritone ve haff to ta
i didnt want to spoil our supper
youd rather spoil our walk home
yeh its cheaper
i just found out i have to go to boston to get a deposition
i might not be back until saturday
mock horror so ill have to order in
dropping the other shoe we have the kids this weekend so
he glances over
i thought it was her weekend
do i ever see you alone
he draws a breath
the concern is behind his eyes
anyway i thought
while im gone
maybe ill hire in some help
just a babysitter i mean
i can take them to work with me i can shift things around you dont need to
i dont expect you to handle them yourself
cant handle them myself is what you mean
maybe shes right
because he doesnt say anything
you dont trust me to be alone with them
i trust you of course i do but but
but youre not good at this
i know how responsible caring adults parent children
im bribe em
but em a dog or something
maybe a doberman
he loves her
but this problem is real
i know they hate me
they dont hate you and what youre telling them is keep hating her keep up the good work nobodys telling them to hate you really
look in your ex wifes eyes
its complicated for jackie
its complicated for me
you dont have kids you dont understand angry now oh right
so its just complicated for you and jackie for me its pretty simple cause i just dont understand
no you dont
and im not gonna screw with my kids heads right now you know i dont need another person in this family making me feel like an idiot
your ex wifes doing a bang up job and i have to face it every tuesday and thursday and every other goddamn weekend and i just dont know how the
hell you were married to her for so goddamn long
jesus what did you see in her
i dont get it i just dont get it
theyve reached their building
as they enter
shes a great mother
the door of the freight elevator clangs open
as rachel and luke step out into their loft the phone is ringing
she looks to luke
then runs to snatch it up
annabelle with a phone in her closet
hearing rachel she hangs up
a pink post it creeps under the door
can i join you for the most beautiful little puppy in the world sitting in a puddle of pee on a hardwood floor
who wants to help clean up this time
overly zealous annabelle
she looks around completely exhausted
annabelle is video taping the dog pee
bens in the kitchen talking to himself
he pours and sprinkles working intently on a magic potion
why do you make that face when you talk to me
she imitates rachel and that voice you use
you think im deaf or something
ben zaps the magic potion theatrically with his fingertips
reaching for her im sorry okay
lets not fi
dont touch me
im allergic to you
she starts sneezing furiously and scratching
ben comes out of the kitchen carrying a steaming cup of potion
those who travel far and near this will make you disappear
i have to work on my video project
dont follow me
i can put myself to bed
she races upstairs
so does ben
excuse me following into annabelles room annabelle lets get something clear
i dont have to listen to you
youre not my mother
thank god for that
she leaves the room slamming the door behind her
takes a breath turns and walks back in
what i meant and perhaps i didnt say it well was you have a great mom
you dont need another one
but when youre at this house this is my daddys house this is my house too
and this is my room so get out
rachel throws open the door
ben stands there innocently
i made you some cocoa
thank you ben
that was so sweet of you
pointedly to annabelle goodnight annabelle
rachel leads ben to his room
with rachel safe out of sight annabelle takes the puppy into her arms and cuddles it
rachel dead on his feet reads goodnight moon to ben
in the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon
arent you going to drink your cocoa
its the good kind
faking a big sip mmmm
youre a master chef ben
just like your dad
ben points to the book she reads skipping pages a hundred miles an hour desperate to get to the end of the book
goodnight moon goodnight hush goodnight mush goodnight goodnight goodnight gracie goodnight ben
youre cheating you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing i cant sleep otherwise
bens eyes are glued to her
she lays down next to him yawns
in the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon
and a picture of the cow jumping over the moon
laying head down thats nice ben
ben reads until rachels asleep
he looks at her in awe
rachels really asleep
he lifts her head
it flops down
in horror he jumps off the bed and with a quick look back races from the room and
darts down the hallway bumping into walls he leaps inside annabelles room slamming the door behind him
triumphantly i killed her
ben and annabelle gape at one another stunned
rachel pulls up fast in lukes grand cherokee
as she screeches to a stop the kids pile out with their gear
rachel takes an anxious look toward jackies place
here we go
the clock reads
rachel and the kids enter
annabelles hair is brushed forward hiding her face
ben is ebullient
jackies edgy ready to snap
how do you hold down a job
you were supposed to be here at
shes missed her sunrise groomn ride
this is friday her riding lesson is on tuesdays
pulls out post it i got it right here
every tuesday except the rd tuesday of the month when its switched to friday except in april when she rides on thursday
its not that hard
didnt you have a mother
flinching can i please have a cup of coffee
we dont have any coffee
what is this
the betty ford center
annabelle hows your video rep
annabelle rushes past her
ben saunters off after his sister
jackie turns to rachel accusingly
what happened with annabelle
has nothing i said gotten through to you
maybe you could back off just a little bit what did you do
look i want to talk to you about
luke said to ask you
jackies edge sharpened by rachels unease
see the place where i can connect with annabelle is my photography
because she loves video and all
shes been talking about this little editing machine its only
a ridiculously expensive and inappropriate item which her father and i have already told her she is far too young to own
but you apparently want to buy her forgiveness with
had enough forgiveness
for what exactly
how much time have you got
lets start with this morning
why did she run from this room
then rachel looks dead on at jackie
luke was in the shower this morning and annabelle sort of walked in without knocking
im sure that didnt upset her
everyone in our family takes showers
i was in there in him
the air is thick with tension
did you or luke talk to her about it afterwards
i thought it might be uncomfortable for her you mean for you
a year old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family
she sees her father naked with another woman for the first time
and you think its best for her if every one pretends it didnt happen
turning away this isnt going to work out
youre damn right
im gonna sick of your imperious bullshit
i never said i was betty fucking crocker
if every time life hits her in the face you want to have a hour talk every third friday or the month go ahead
i have a life
oh and i dont because i have a children
the problem is youre too self involved to ever be a mother
maybe the problem is your kids maybe theyre spoiled coddled brats get out
holding up post its but its not on the schedule
you got to hell
jackie turns away storming out of the room
ah ah ah
you owe me a quarter luke stands in an apron before annabelles girl scout troop rolling out a large pie dough
they imitate his every move
now ladies the secrets to a great pie is the crust
and the secret to a great flaky pie crust comes from less flour and more
ice cold water
adoringly thats my girl
rachel watches from a corner
blueberry pie must be topped with vanilla haagan daz and or creme fraiche
now the secret to a great creme fraiche is
which also is the secret to
now dont forget to teach your fathers that
apple brown betty
he takes off his apron and walks toward rachel as the girls file out
she said no
he doesnt even know what shes talking about
the editing machine
i mean annabelle would have really loved it
she looks down
it would have been great for us so obviously jackie just
choosing her words
shes really a difficult person
best thing ever happened to you was her throwing you out on your butt
not that i have a personal stake in it
he comes and kisses her
to get really mad
annabelles video report has been switched again
hey i sold my body to satan to clear friday at two oclo
we have the kids
and its my call
i promised them water skiing instead o
quiet pain our weekend
at that sweet little he puts his arms around her
and the evil part is
i am so stoked about the water skiing
i cant wait
he tastes her mouth
a sweet hot moment
her fingers trace up his neck
to his hair
no this is good
celibacy is healthy
for a guy your age
youll get used to it
from the kiss that follows
he wont have to
close on an answering machine
it clicks whirls and
hi its the trophy bimbo
annabelles teacher called and her video report is being moved up to tomorrow
sorry to deprive your step aerobics class of their role model
pull back to see
im sorry i lost my temper the other day
and im sure you are too so
ben looming over the hardware
fingers poised above the buttons and he
no apology necessa
playing all the keys at once
like chords on a baby grand
close on a small tv monitor the angelic face of year old tamara practicing for the miss america diplomatic interview circa
well i had a million dollars
i would use it to
feed all the precious hungry children of the world
and bring about total world peace
pull back to see the class and teacher watching raptly
filmmaker annabelle in the seat of honor next to her proud father
rachel in the back of the room anxiously looking at the back door
while on screen
jared bad as he wanna be
a million big ones
id buy about a thousand babes
not to do anything bad i mean
just to hang with
near the monitor annabelles eyes are also furtively cutting to the classrooms back door
on screen now
the handsomest year old since dicaprio
brad the dreamboat
stares soulfully at the camera
well first off annabelle
id give half of it
the class ooooos whistles
annabelle flushes but she clearly likes it
brad grins a redford grin her way
and through the back door bursts
a harried disheveled jackie
still in workout clothes
as on screen
there you have it
now ask yourself what would you do
the screen goes black
the class teacher and especially luke erupt with applause
so does jackie who has locked eyes across the room with her mortally wounded abandoned daughter
then jackies eyes cut to
rachel a deer in headlights
death by army ants would be too kind
annabelle luke and jackie glaring at rachel who looks awkwardly at her feet
kids stream past unaware of the gravity of the moment
machines do not eat message
of all the cheap excuses
to break a childs heart
the jury is in
there is no appeal
jackie takes her daughters hand
dont worry sweetie theres still the harvest pageant
and you are the lead vegetable
said with bottomless pride
and no one can keep me away
one laser look at luke
this bitch is your responsibility
and she leads her baby off
a parked van packed with snowboards and ski gear
pan across the suburban lawn to
luke dejected at jackies door
rachel nearby still peers into the window of an unlit empty house
a cellular phone rings
luke whips it out like the governors pardon hangs in the balance
from carphone you paged us
distraught where are you
jackie on her cellular herding the kids toward a circus tent
just outside the big top were almo
at the big apple circus its the only big top i know
i said id get em back tonight
jackie we were taking them water skiing for the whole weekend
innocent until the plan changed when jessies mom gave us these tickets
forgot i told her
lukes eyes dart to an uncomprehended rachel
shes never seen him this angry
dont tell me
another machine ate another message
boy theres a lot of that going around
put her on huh
he hands the phone to rachel
she brings it to her ear
before you ever pull that again
the line is dead
and so is rachel
a glum annabelle and ben sitting on a bench watching rachel at her photo shoot george between them
a beautiful woman appears in the turret she lets down her hair a modern day rapunzel her golden locks fall feet now a burst of yellow as a hundred yellow
canaries fly out from her mane
a beautiful man begins to climb the hair
the man dangling in mid air surrounded by canaries
rachel works with intense concentration
its been hours
annabelle and ben are completely bored
to cooper the timing was off i need this light
to herself just where i wanna be all saturd
to everyone hold lunch
but were hungry and i have to pick up my costume for the pageant
it starts at seven
its only one oclock
why dont you get another fudgesicle ill be done soon really soon
annabelle and ben
rolling their eyes
annabelle asleep on the bench
rachel stands over her a canary on her finger
lunch time sleeping beauty
is he in the bathroom
i dont know
i feel like im gonna throw up
annabelle stands with rachel by a line of empty urinals
what if hes kidnapped
hes not kidnapped hes hes just hiding hes just bennnn
panicked she grabs annabelles hand
dont touch me
you bring bad luck
starting to believe it
breathless annabelle and rachel climb the castle stairs when they hear whimpering rachel follows the whimpering running ben
ben were here
in the corner of the tower we see george staring up at her
but ben is nowhere to be found
hes gone forever and im gonna miss the pageant
rachel once more
her life flashing before her eyes
jackie blasts up in the volvo slams to a stop in a non spot races into
jackie runs through the police station moving down corridors past desks until she sees ben sitting with two policemen on a bench
she holds him to her chest shaking
oh my ben
are you alright
i knew where i was all the time
ben sits between jackie and luke holding each of their hands
rachel sits on the other side of luke all waiting for the harvest pageant to begin
its horribly tense
i am so sorry about today i really fucked up royalty
when you called luke i was so goddamn relieved luke elbows her with an were in an elementary school elbow
no i did i know i did i screwed up
i feel like such an asshole
jackie lifts ben onto her lap holding him tightly
she turns and faces rachel claws bared
the lights go down
they sit pretending the other is not there
on stage the class is dressed as the harvest produce
annabelle is the corn
each food dish steps forward and introduces itself
annabelle rehearing her line over and over
i am maze
but you can call me corn
inside her costume her breathing is sharp
she stands very straight very bold
a brazen ear of corn
she steps forward
rachel pops up next to the stage with her huge professional camera and giant flash
her camera flashes three times quickly
after each flash we see the picture for a split second annabelle
a terrified ear of corn
a lost ear of corn
blinks disoriented um
in the audience jackie is willing her daughter a recovery
sees instead a completely devastated ear of corn
exploding in tears oh forget it
she runs offstage amidst laughter and applause
luke looks over at jackie but she and ben have already left their seats
jackie comforts annabelle
ben watches closely getting caught up in his sisters sadness
luke and rachel approach
i hate her
i really hate her
there you are
covering her face dont take my picture
she starts to cry
bens lip quivers his eyes well up
annabelle doesnt really want to talk to you right now
im sorry i didnt mean to break your concentration
i thought it would be a nice moment to rememb
i dont ever want to remember this
a turkey approaches
theyre taking a picture of the produce we need the corn
no ones laughing at you
your friends want you to join them anna belle
corn is a very important part of the harvest produce
now ben walk your sister over to the yams
ben takes annabelles hand
when they are gone
jackie if i thought for one moment
lighting into luke you listen carefully because i am only going to say this once
that woman has nothing more to do with my children
do you realize what could have hap pened to your son today
how lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did
he could have been
but he hasnt
he wandered off
i know its terrifying
i can imagine how you felt when that call came but it happens
not to me
soft reasonable jackie youve made mistakes we all make mistakes im not gonna wait around to see the next one
im not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement
im seeing a lawyer
we promised we never go there
weve broken a lot of promises havent we luke
why are you taking this out on him rache get out of th
still to jackie you havent done one goddam thing to make any of this easier
i am not here to make it easier for you
these are my children
they dont want to be with you
well maybe they would if they thought it was okay with y
poking lukes chest a court order is gonna say that woman is never alone with my children
ever again do you hear that
all of new jersey heard that
on the silence that follows she stalks off
the mother lion
doing what she has to do
jackie and her children ride horses side by side through a perfect fall afternoon
our riders look about alertly as if patrolling enemy territory
guinevere godiva i sense enemy sol
i dont want to be lady godiva anymore no matter how much i like chocolate
i want to be a stud
in distance a gaggle of groundskeepers
jackie points these out to ben without missing a beat
lord nelson napoleons troops
i fear for the women and the property values
ill ride ahead
nelson protect the queen
and she canters off blood in her eye
alone now with his mom ben has something serious on his mind
its not rachels fault i ran away
doesnt turn no thats your fault
its her fault for not watching over my precious son as if it were her priority
which means the most important job
thinks about this rachels job is she works
ben mommies work too
they work very hard
mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working
i just dont get paid
does rachel make a lot of money
people like rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money
i think shes pretty mommy
if you like big hair
if you want me to hate her i will
her lips part for an answer
but she hasnt got one
luke pacing around on the path through jackies front lawn
jackie exits the house alone
stands on the porch
and they stare at each other
you know you can come inside the house
he looks at the end of his rope
she walks down to him
quietly did you see the lawyer
we set an ap
almost a whisper dont do this
the air comes out of her
we see how much she still cares for this man
youre saying dont make the kids a football dont put them through a war
but im doing this for their well being
but partly youre mad
at each other
you know the kids arent really in danger
this is about rachel and youre right im disappointed in her learning curve and
slugs have faster learning curves
he takes a breath
here it is im afraid shes going to walk
and im supposed to care
he reaches out
takes her hands
softly about me yeh
like i care about you
she looks in his eyes
like you cared about me three years ago
looks saddened by that
you kicked me out
and just this once
with all thats happened
jackie needs to say
maybe you should talk to your daughter about why
she seems to have missed that part
now he looks ashamed
and sorry from his heart
softly forget i said that
he has to tell her
this thing with rache
i need this
i dont want to lose her
and i will see to it that the kids dont suffer
help me huh
id do it for you
yes he would
despite everything she knows that
one last chance dont make me regret it
her voice tried to be tough
but the tension showed through
or you will too
a last look
she walks slowly
back toward the house
the last cars are pulling away
no kids left except the ones shooting hoops
on the low brick ledge by the flag pole
rachel and cooper sit on a bare floor surrounded by countless proofs of flying canaries
an assistant brings a cell phone to rachel who holds it in place with her shoulder as she frantically sorts through the prints
into phone no no that is not possible
you must have the wrong little gir
into phone because annabelles mother never forgets is never late is never imperfect
so thats some other kid sitting on the curb by the car pool li
all the air comes out
she looks around sadly at all the work surrounding her
may i remind you that duncan has the client arriving at exac
into phone sure
i was just doin my nails
a cavernous sterile room
a horrible metallic hammering sound
pan to see that it comes from
a white cylindrical tube
bare feet protrude
an mri is in progress
the sound stops
the body slides from the tube a woman in a hospital gown
she is jackie
she blinks at the light
her eyes are drawn a million miles away
a lot on her mind
a technician enters the room
your paper went off during the procedure
do you want the number
jackie turns suddenly focusing
what time is it
annabelle sits glumly refusing to eat some chips from the bag in rachels hand
rachels voice is low soothing
dare we say maternal
hey sea salt and vinegar i know this is your fave
annabelle keeps her eyes down
this is more than a sulk
she seems fairly unglued
cmon these are the bomb i prom
now could she just
i mean thats something you would do
rachel stares back
eats a chip
softly tell ya the truth
the kid blinks
a non compute
your mom had to
help a friend with this
and she called me
and we switched days
then i got stuck on my shoot and
rachel whirls to see jackie filling the doorway annabelle flying to her mothers arms
the womens eyes meet
how much did she hear
jackie brushing out annabelles hair
jackies eyes are distant
annabelle watching in the mirror
are you worried about your friend
with the emergency
jackies eyes come back to focus
oh im waiting on some news thats all
can i ask you why you never asked me something you probably asked daddy anyway
and she smiles
so annabelle smiles back
you can try
gentler slower strokes
daddy was washing rachel
in the shower
what did you think that was about
well not exactly s
why does rachel scream
does she mean what jackie thinks she means
how would you know sh
in the same country
her mother laughs
imitating oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh
why do you think
because it feels really incredibly good
jackie moves around
leans to stare in her eyes
so why are you asking me
i like talking about it
at least to you
the look holds
almost a bittersweet smile plays on jackies lips
she leans to kiss her daughters head
a murmur same here huh
total darkness slowly an image appears floating in a pool of water
its a photo of a childs feet
only the wrong shoe is on the wrong foot
dont let the light
jackie enters leaving the door wide open
look im not real comfortable being here but
i dont recall inviting you
i overhead what you told annabelle
what are they feeling
i have a snoop
i didnt need you to take the blame for me im quite
simply i didnt do it for you
finds that interesting
shrugs she already hates me
youve seen to that
youre not terribly good at taking care of h
i need practice
those are my children youre practicing on
they deserve first rate care
of every night
and every day
so why did y
i did it for her
straight to her eyes
poor kid has to believe in someone
even if its you
nothing friendly about it
but jackie hasnt come seeking friendship
i have an appointment this after noon
i need someone to take them to the park
and have federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders
how many years do you get in this state for giving second rate care to minors
its not enough
im already on thin ice
yesterday i actually thought my boss was going to fire me
fine forget it
but neither of them wants her to
a mexican standoff
until jackie empties her huge purse on the counter
bandaids for cuts
bandaids for new shoe blisters
packet of wash n dris
sugar free lollipops potty seat covers for public restrooms
why not just bring the whole toilet
ben likes to be read to
do you know dr
do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can i finish
this silences rachel
jackie hands her a post it
heres their schedule for this after noon
ill meet you at the park at five
all i ask is that theyre alive when i get there
dry thank you
and scoops up the parenting paraphernalia
drier thank you
and walks out the door
jackie stands outside a door
she knocks and enters
he sits behind his desk across from a client
both men looking up at this stranger
forgive the intrusion im jacqueline harrison and
the sweetest smile shes got
which is pretty good
well i just wanted to thank you
for your generosity
a beat gener
my daughter had a terrible emergency yesterday
my husband and i couldnt be reached and
kelly came to annabelles rescue
id hate to think what might have happened
shakes her hand
she told me that you were so suppor tive even at great inconvenience to your business and
an amazing smile
its wonderful to see a successful man
with that sense of priorities
longer beat well
under the circumstances
if i can ever repay your kindness
it would be my great pleasure
backing out the door
and your ms
a remarkable young woman
the client is beaming
clearing his throat we think so
close on jackie looking down
she seems to be staring at something in her lap
quiet anger i dont even know what that means
that is very unclear
but there is nothing there
her lap is empty
except for her unnaturally still hands
female voice o
gently i means we found some cells
in your lymph nodes
in three of them
the hands come together
stating to anyone who would watch that there is no panic here
but the other time
you said you got it all
so you could be wrong again
one time you say one thing then
the other time
was a year ago
the air comes out of jackie
in a thin slow precise stream
everything her very breath
under complete control
that was a tiny lump in the breast
we radiated we thought we had it all
we were hopeful
but there were no guarantees
jackies eyes stay on her folded still hands
but we can beat it
pull back to see the small neatly kept office
sweikert is slender elegant kind
the doctor you want when youre dying
jackie looks up to her
people beat it dont they
all the time
straight every day
more and more
the confirmation of hope has allowed some of the fear to show
radiate some more
then after awhile some chemo
jackie absorbs this
thats necessary huh
lets take our best shot
staring at the woman
then to break the spell
i guess a no hair day beats a bad hair day
the doctor smiles
jackie looks at her watch
i have to get dressed
my ex husband has asked me to dinner
god knows why he was very mysteri
have you still never told him
a flash of the anger flickers
why would his worry
or my childrens worry
or anyones worry
help the sit
very soft sooner than later
you really need to
that brings a silence
a shading of defiance to jackies features
you dont burden others needlessly
thats how i was raised doctor
hold the look
maybe at dinner tonight
think about it
jackie is getting dressed in front of the mirror her eyes distant in spite of her attempts at control
annabelle is watching her like a hawk
we see ben in the background sawing the babysitter alise in half
why are you going to a french restaurant
throughout annabelle is trying on jackies jewelry making a pest of herself
jackie fights against rising irritation
because its quiet
and he wants to talk
alise once he saws you in half its bedtime
what are you gonna talk about
applying mascara probably you your brother school the solar system
then why are you putting on mascara
a beat im a little tired and its just a pick me up
but you only wore mascara when you and daddy went on romantic dates
well daddy and i are just friends now and thats no reason not to wear mascara
you look pale
a country french place on the west side
classy but inviting
jackie and luke sit across from each other in the lovely restaurant
jackie looks beautiful in the warm candlelight
maybe you dont think three years is enough for a person to change but
things are different now jackie
jackie feels her heart beginning to race
they lock eyes for a moment
he unconsciously begins to eat off her plate
he eats her chicken and in the dance theyve done a thousand times she reaches for his uneaten vegetables
the waiter approaches
would you and your wife prefer still or sparkling water
he doesnt correct the waiter
when the waiter leaves annabelle showed me the new dress
shes amazing in it
getting so beautiful
she looks more like you every day
luke downs jackies wine jackie
ive really given this a lot of thought
a great deal of thought
their eyes lock for a moment
here it comes
im gonna marry rachel
i know you dont think much of her but shes a special person she really is
and i love her
this is a bridge we never wanted to cross but its not helping her or the kids if i dont really commit to that
jackie stares at him stonefaced
i didnt think a phone call was appropriate
tell me exactly how youre different from three years ago
the music sounds kind of the same from where im sitting
he shifts in his chair
wants this to sound as authentic as he feels it
i grew up a little
im ready for a life thats built around commitm
just not to me
the waiter returns with a bottle of red wine
its horribly quiet as he pours
thank you its fine
would you like to taste it
can we please have less service here
the waiter leaves taking his attitude with him
its going to be hard for the kids when i tell them
id like you to be there
to make it easier for them or you
its a huge moment in their life you cant be an us just when you want to
you cant play that card when its convenient
we are over
were still their parents for the next hundred years
on this jackie looks down at her hands
youre still going to have to be dealing with me with us
we should tell them together
you think this is going to help the kids then you do it
youre on your own
jackie sits next to luke on the couch looking lovingly towards the children who sit across from them
annabelle is taping this
the great thing about life is that things keep changing
remember when mommy and daddy got divorced
and we all went through that together
oh my god
he knew it
on annabelle behind the video camera wheres this headed
well things are going to change again
ben leaps up from the couch and flies into jackies arms
i knew it
i knew it
i knew you guys were getting back together
jackie looks at luke
annabelle zooms in on their faces
no theyre not
annabelle put down that camera
she zooms in on his face
put down that goddamn camera
you owe me a quarter
look shes upset no im not
i dont care
why should i care
i mean nobody asked me when you got divorced
nobody asked me if i wanted a new mother
nobody even asked me if i like her
if you guys dont care about our family staying together why sh
daddy and i tried hard
we really did
no you didnt
all you guys did was name call
i heard you
you didnt even try and use your words
ben runs out of the room
luke follows him
ben pulls his cape over his head and hides in a bundle in the corner
im almost invisible
holding him ill find you wherever you go
my magic boy
im still your daddy
nothing will ever change that
jackie moves to annabelle who wont put down the camera
rachels not taking my place as your mother its just daddys chance to be happy again
isnt that what we all want for each other
jackie looks at this daughter she loves so much
pats the seat beside her
something in the softening of the tone changes the atmosphere in the room
more like equals
life is full of hard things
and we cant always have what we want you know that
annabelle nods cautiously
but we do have a choice
to make it better
instead of worse
like seeing the good side of rachel
so shell see the good side of us
annabelles stare is hard and questioning
she didnt expect this
because im looking ahead
and you know what i see
but she sure is listening
time will come
when we all need to be there
for each other
strokes her babys hair
straight back ill be there for you
her mothers eyes cloud with feeling
im counting on it
barely any light in the empty kitchen
pan to see ben alone in his cape
carefully he sets a cup of saucer atop a cloth napkin that lies across the butcher block table
he grasps the corners of the napkin
he looks scared
we get whats about to happen
yanks the napkin as fast as he can the cup and saucer rattle and
and then he looks up
to a cabinet filled
with glassware and china
rachels hand as a beautiful antique ring is slipped on her finger
she is asleep
stares at her hand in shock and delight
oh my god
are you serious
tenderly i think so
what do you think
i think so too
they hold each other for a long time
its forever you know
trying to read him okay
is that the good thing or the bad thing
because i cant hurt anyone like this ever again
how did you hurt someone
she threw you out remember
she hugs him tight
everythings gonna work out
the kids and i
were going to love each other
rache it may take time
whats eight ten years
hell youll still be ambulatory
shes counting on her fingers
he kisses her
look i was defensive i was insecure
i was afraid to love first
her incredible smile
filling even luke with confidence
but im not anymore
a sudden horrific crashing sound
the breakage of the breakable
their look holds
ill get this
a quick kiss
and shes gone
hold on lukes light smile
maybe this will all work out
ben is cuddled up in his coverlet
almost as if hes hiding
she picks up some stray underpants
actually three of them
are you real mad
how could i be
we learned some magic
she goes to his bed
i made all the pieces disappear
she leans toward him
and you learned
she kisses his forehead
to make that trick disappear huh
she stands smiles
softly a night
they share the smile
and rachel leaves into the darkened hall
down it now only to
open a door so quietly
the room of a sleeping child
rachel moves soundlessly to annabelles side
listens to the soft breathing
she straightens the covers slightly in a maternal way
then on impulse reaches down
tenderly smooths back a strand of hair
one last look
hold on annabelle as we hear the knob turn
the door close
annabelle opens her eyes
she is thinking
rachel dropping off annabelle at jackies door
they must be late because rachel is looking anxiously at her watch
not even noticing that annabelle has pulled out a tube of lip gloss turning the shaft to reveal a glittering golden colored gloss
put that away hon your mom w
the door opens
jackie is dressed for riding
sincere sorry im late i got lost dropping ben off at kevins
its okay its twenty minutes
the horsell be there
is she on the right planet
mom look what rache got me
the kid holds it up
its not to wear around or any thing im way too young
its just for play
taking it that is so pretty
you usually only see that color in peoples teeth
annabelle has entered the house to see on a table by the door a huge brightly wrapped package
whos that for
its for you
the kid whirls around
just because i love you
annabelle starts to unwrap the present with christmas morning care
jackie looks at the glitter gloss
im sorry i just
at least its not an editing machine
i told her two three years maybe for such an expens
because the paper has come off
a giant deluxe model beginners video editor
annabelle is stunned silent
tears in her eyes oh mommy
and jumps into jackies arms crushing her with the hug mothers live for
i hope its the right kind
are you kidding it is so much better than the one rachel showed me
jackie strokes her babys head
well i thought
you know why wait
the child turns to rachel frozen in the doorwary
told you i was big enough
is my mom the greatest or what
hold on the look
the women share
jackie and annabelle riding
the kid is still on cloud nine
jackies eyes are on her
i mean she knows all the music and pop stars and clothes and stuff
shes like still a kid herself
like a big sister
she knows every neat junk food place
looks to see if her mom is okay hearing
shes kind of cool when you get to know her
annabelle studies her moms profile
and dont tell her i told you
secrets safe with me
rachel sits cross legged on the floor of the walk in closet
next to her a glass and a botle of stolie getting toward the bottom
an ashtray filled with butts and
a card board box
dragged out of somewhere
photo albums loose snapshots
from her face this is not a carefree romp down memory lane
she takes another hit on the stolie
more than slightly intoxicated weaving squinting at
the next photo
luke young straddling a kawasaki
jackie just as young holding him from behind
she wears a halter and shorts and looks simply terrific
rachel looks drunk and jealous
with an overlay of self pity
brings the photo closer
what the fuck is that
her worst fears confirmed
a tattoo the lights are coming on in the city
jackie sits staring out the window as an iv drips into her arm
she is alone and down
and fighting the fear of what may come to pass
her pager goes off
she pulls a cell phone from her purse
works it with one hand
softly hey good lookin i was just thinking about calling y
intercut throughout ben on the phone in rachels and lukes kitchen
he is alone
staring through the glass window of the oven
rache says i have to eat lamb told her youre making me spaghetti honey this is thursday
i pick you up tomorrow and we do big spaghetti
and many meatballs
a nurse enters and jackie shoots her with a wave of her fingers
youll be up to your armpits in meatballs im flying them in from sweden
is that like luigis
she loves this kid so much
not a lot sweetie
its a country
where are you anyway
and the feeling comes straight to her eyes
she cant fight it
im somewhere thinking of you
and you know what
of course you do
then you know ive got a flu bug and i turn green and barf profusely when i even think about food
so all the more meatballs for you
but you know what
do i have to eat lamb
daddy didnt cook it she did
do me a favor
eat it and then give me a secret report okay
pay particular attention to whether its chewy and if it tastes more like chocolate or soup
and she can hear that
and her eyes fill
and she murmurs
hey thats a world class laugh you got there
can i all you sometime
if i fell blue
and for a heartbeat the fear
did he hear it in my voice
you got my number
and now shes crying
but she cant
gains control for a whispered
that i do
im fine ba
can i have one butterscotch pudding for dessert
see her relief
secret still safe
we can only have two
jackie is pushing her cart
ben sits in it pulling things off the shelves
on automatic shes putting them back
mommy if your real names jackie and i call you mommy and rachels real names rachel
then when i see her do i say hi stepmommy
and if my names ben how come you dont call me son
lost in thought thursdays fine
frustrated ben climbs out of the cart and trails behind jackie
he reaches for an apple off the bottom of a huge display of red delicious and the whole thing comes tumbling down
shaken she looks around for ben
jackie with a store manager and a policeman stand at the front of the store near the bakery
jackie is totally distraught
i looked away for one second
just one second
how would you describe him
hes my son
he looks like his father
his name is ben he answers to harry is he wearing a red shirt
the manager points to the frozen food bin
there lying on his back atop dwindling stores of breyers ice cream
hands and beaming face pressed to the underside of the glass
jackie does the only reasonable thing
and flings open snow whites glass coffin
i got my warm t shirt
enough of a non sequitur to make everybody blink before jackie yanks him roughly and tenderly from the bin
she crushes him in a violent desperate hug
you found me cause im your priority huh
she kisses him fiercely
at the edge of tears
you got that right
luke coaching the girls team
annabelle one of many who surround him for that final word of wisdom
alright my little warriors remain calm trust that the ball will find you remember theyre your opponent not your enemies not kick major butt
in the bleachers jackie sits alone with rachel
they are having a coaching session of their own
rachel points down to the field where
annabelle pushes her hair over her eyes
shes gonna trip over her own feet if she doesnt get her hair out of her eyes
jackie casts a sidelong glance at rachel
decides to tell her
pushing her hair over her eyes
means shes avoiding a confrontation
rachel looks over
jackie decides to share more
reading rachels reaction to
if shes twirling it shes playing something out in her mind
if shes stopped combing it she might be depressed
as rachel listens shes unconsciously twisting her hair
what about obsessively picking her split ends
last week when she chopped her barbies bangs all to hell she was angry at herself
when i twisted hair like this it means im intimidated by you
jackie gives her the trace of a smile
ill keep it in mind and use it against you
she looks back down at the game
rachel watching her profile
you feeling all right
doesnt turn not great
plus ive got things on my mind
rachel doesnt know
jackie snorts a laugh
in spite of herself
yeh that does tend to make me sick to my stomach
actually im uh
deciding if this is the time to say
thinking of going back to random house
on a part time basis
but jackie still hasnt turned
eyes glued to annabelle racing around with determination
well i could do most of it from home
but while im working it out with the head editor id need to
boy this is tough
tries for matter of fact
make some trips into the city
hey any help you need well cover
but she still hasnt turned to look rachel in the eye
have you told luke and the ki
hold up for a bit
it may not happen
our secret okay
a little strange
particularly the hardness of jackies eyes
rachel watching her
softly sure if you like
jackie looks away now
to the playground just beyond the bleachers
kids rise swings clamber over a jungle gym
but her eyes are routinely automatically zeroing in on one single kid
who is climbing his way up a tall slide
crouched over as he inches up the shiny metal surface using the side rails
rachel follows jackies eyes just as
ben reaches the top and stands up hands over his head jackies breath catching ben totters once and
falls fast hitting the grass with a thump we can hear lying crumpled motionless as our two women
spring up as one scrambling down the bleachers running toward the playground jackie initially in the lead but rachel out sprints her closing on the child as he rolls over
grasping his leg and reaching him first
some instinct makes her hold back let jackie rush past her to kneel at bens side
she lifts her baby in her arms
his pants are torn his leg is bleeding
his own concern
i can still go to tuckers party right
a full house of walk ins with assorted needs none of which appear to require george clooney on an urgent basis
across the room an irritated jackie finishes the last of the paperwork at the nurses station
exchanges a less than pleasantry with the less than helpful duty nurse and
heads off through the crowd down a hallway turns a corner to see
luke stands by a doorway
smiling as he gazes into a hospital room
jackie comes to his side looks in
ben doesnt see them
his back is turned as he talks to rachel who sits on the side of his bed feeding him the pudding she got from a vending machine
for christmas okay
every magician needs a white dove a real one they do well thats a long way off sweetie
well talk to mom and dad
you can talk him into anything
unseen by the two luke grins
then ben snuggles into rachels arms and kisses her
singing softly in the still
still of the ni ight
i held you
held you so ti ight
take it man
singing softly doo wop doo doo doo wop doo doo
jackie stands there
her eyes are difficult to read
but she sure is watching
softly nice huh
she steps back
looks him in the eye
its about time
he give her a goofy give me a break face
she twists the corner of a smile
shes a charmer youll see
in fifty years the kidsll love her ten percent as much as they love you
youre making me insecure
now theyre smiling at each other
in the old way
a nice moment for them
you changed your hair
and we notice
it does look different
grins its good
youre not pulling a mid life crisis on us are you
her look holds
an odd extra beat
not the term id use
he glances back through the doorway
you want us to take him tonight
give you some private time with annab
never stand between that kid and a meatball
yet another spaghetti night
yeh better i should forcefeed him burnt lamb and
couscous was it she made him
boy kids go wild for that
she pats him on the shoulder
ill drop him at tuckers party saturday if one of you guys can pick him up
i have to go into the city
and breezes by him into the room
ben wheels to see her
you know what happens to spaghetti when it waits around for you too long
he really thinks
we never find out
a door with balloons opens stacy the birthday boys mom stands there children running behind her in party hats all with their conservatively dressed suburban moms
rachels attire a sharp contrast
hi im here to pick up ben
does jackie know this
im doing it behind her back
in seven years jackies never missed one of tuckers parties
where is she
something came up
ive got a shoot at three
tucker hasnt penned bens present yet it wont be too much longer
rachel eyes the mound of presents yet to be opened
forty five minutes later
rachel in a pointed party hat sits schmushed on the couch in between all the other mothers
a black jeans stranger in a strange peach land
she eyes that mound of presents
not even a dent
she pulls out her cell phone moves towards the hallway
pull a number steel blue gel on the back light
yeah im on my way but
a piece of cake flies through the air and lands on rachel
now ben let tucker play with his batcave
ben wont let go of tuckers presents
tucker tries to take it
ben is adamant
rachel reaches for him tousling his hair
hey benjy boy chill
he shimmies away from her hes there already
no i dont want to talk to him duncan
how are you
the mothers are all too aware of rachel on the phone
two kids shoot water guns rachel gets drenched
ben pulls at the toys
i want it
ben i know youre angry and confused but its tuckers birthday party
ben and tucker fight for it the mothers all look to rachel
ben into phone duncan im aware of that goddamn it ben
let go of it
he stares at her
it looks like hes gonna let go on the mothers impressed not to mention surprised
when ben suddenly hurls the toy onto the floor shattering it
a horrible silence falls over the room
broken only by the sound of duncan screaming from inside the phone
this is a big bloody account if you dont show up in five minutes
rachel takes ben and leads him into another room
ben im sorry
its been a hard day
now would you do us both a favor and take this phone and
she slams the phone shut
hands it to ben
make it disappear
he shoves it down the front of his pants
the peach moms are taken aback
rachel nods you got it
delighted ben turns scampers off as
his pants start ringing
he stops dead
looks down at them
he turns around and waddles delicately back to rachel as if hes carrying nitro in his shorts
she holds out her hand
breaks out the geiger counter the man is radio active
he pulls the ringing phone from his pants
she grasps it without hesitation while peach moms wince in disgust
snaps it open
get over it dunc
stops whoa whoa annab
while everybody watches
could it be maybe
another galaxy would be more convenient
everybody really watching
gently okay dont cry
flunking science is not happening
on my watch
all the kids are running around crazily in a hypersugared frenzy
peach moms drink diet sodas and chat
rachel making a call by the phony little carp pond
just that her daughter left a science book somewhere at her house and i need t
intercut throughout a starchy powerful crisply intellectual senior editor in her early fifties and her jil sander outfit
the east side below her window
im sorry ms
harrison is not here
i think i mentioned that
well shes been meeting with the head editor for the last few w
miss i am senior editor
harrison left random house eleven years ago
we have not had the pleas ure of a visit from her in that time
actually shes going back to work with your company on a part time basis
if jackie harrison were coming back to the editorial staff i would be frankly delighted
would be the first
in the midst of hysterical children
thank you for your time
dont mention it
and rachels line
rachel alone at jackies front door
staring at the key in her hand
one last chance to back out
mutters what the hell
opens the door
enters the empty home
walks slowly self consciously down the hallway
kitchen kids rooms
now if i were a science book where would i
at the doorway of the master bedroom
who am i kidding
and goes straight to jackies desk
starts rummaging through the incredibly neat stack of papers
great im leaving prints
the open appointment book
just says new york
opens a drawer
stapler clips neatly stacked stationery
opens the bottom drawer and
she pulls out
opens the folder
newark to san francisco
and tucked inside
a fax neatly folded
rachel opens it
the letterhead says north point press sutter street san francisco california
charlene drummond editor
cant wait to see you here
i know youre anxious
but its going to work out wonderfully i promise
hold on rachel
trying to put this together
jackie takes a kettle from the stove
pours the water into a tea cup
then fills a second cup
drops a tea bag into each
carries both cups to
the kitchen table
where rachel is waiting
she looks more than tense
jackie taking this in as she sets down the tea
okay what is this
if you want to dump luke on me no sale
youre stuck with him
and before she can sit
i know your secret
no one says anything
two hearts beating at red line
i dont know wh
i was looking for annabelles book and i found your tickets
and the note
from your new boss
jackie leans forward
her hands resting on the back of the chair she never sat in
youre not working at random house i talked to them
youre taking the kids
and moving to san francisco
and jackie has to laugh
look youve never liked me
dont flatter yourself
and i know checking into your life was inexcusable
nobody likes a snoop
but i came here to
all the air comes out of this young woman
so vulnerable so real
to beg you
not to do it
and at this
a look of intense interest crosses jackies face
id have thought this was the answer to your prayers
lose the witch and her two brats in one swoop
rachel is clearly distraught
this is no act
you cant take lukes children away from him
reading this girls face
bi coastal parenting
happens every day
luke gets the kids every other summer every other holiday its not ideal but people make it work and
blurts we cant live like that
and jackie straightens
cocks her head
did i hear the word
cant live like that
then let him talks to me
we dont need you to solve our prob
quietly its my problem too
and rachels eyes
fill with tears
she hates that
jackie wont take her off the hook
stands waiting until
i got used to
thinking of them
my kids too
by what right
six months of part time screw ups
rachel lifts her chin
defiant and tender at once
no right at all
i just love them
now its jackies eyes
that begin to fill
and she hates that even more
pleading theres so many publishing houses in new york
surely you could find a good one
jackie takes a step back
shakes her head
goddammit life is full of surprises
she walks around in a little circle
sure i could
if i was looking for one
rachels turn to be surprised
youre a moron kid
you guessed the wrong secret
an odd almost defiant look
jackie reaches up to her own head and
slowly holding eye contact all the way she slips the wig from her head
her scalp covered by the partial regrowth that chemo therapy has left her
you can hear rachels gasp clear to kansas
calmly charlie drummond used to be a colleague at random house
im crashing at her place while i take some new protein injections my oncologist recommended
i can only get them in san francisco
rachels lips part
but no sound comes
lifes a trade off
you get cancer your hair falls out but you do get to smoke dope
please youre not dying
the kid so painfully sincere
no such luck
im beating the shit out of this
pardon my french
rachel cant find her breath
she is clearly the worse off of the two in this moment
then she starts to nod
you bet you are
how the hell would you know
i dont but
how would you know anything that was sharp
rachel startles slightly
i exercise i eat the healthiest foods you live on pork rinds and ho hos and ive got cancer
that leaves a silence
i smoke too
you are marrying the greatest guy who walks this earth who i have loved from my heart for twelve years listening
and you walk in
you smile that smile
you move that boy
and hes yours for free
she sags back against the counter
love my kids
how fucking touching
they came out of my body see i know that
i have given them more love and more care every fifteen minutes of their lives than you could manage in the next fifty years leans over the table
rachel looks scared to death
okay im undeserving
and staring in rachels eyes jackies fierceness fades
ironic that im gonna need you
all the air comes out
her heart as naked as her skull
to be a little less
the look holds
quietly drink your tea while i go vomit
and turns goes to the door
you love my kids thats a start
nods well work on it
hear her footsteps
rachel lifts her cup
looks at it
calling out this is very good tea
then tastes it
makes a face
a graceful stone building with arched windows
gas lanterns on the exterior wall and burning dimly inside
stone gargoyles smile down on those who enter the heavy bright red wooden door
dim lights clink of glasses the hum of private conversations side by side
civilized as hell
and at the deuce by the window
the mans head is down
we cant see lukes expression as he stares at his clenched hands
we dont need to
i thought a phone call was inappropriate
no one smiles at the irony
not much to smile about
i could have taken you to that restaurant but it would have been a waste of money
he loos up
she studies the pain
softly i know
i wouldnt know what to say
if it were you
were going to win this
straight back walk in the park
and thanks for the we
tears fill his eyes
none in hers
youre not alone in this
youre not alone
jesus youre not alone okay
tries a smile that doesnt get halfway there
what happens next
i live or i die
looks straight in his eyes
we dont need the bullshit
tell the kids together
a barely perceptible nod
want rache someplace else
on that one
she has to smile
on your learning curve
jackie carrying two steaming mugs from her stove
these have marshmallows floating in them
she sets them down in front of her children
ben starts plucking the marshmallows out of annabelles mug
annabelle doesnt care too busy video taping
who sits with this tender compassionate and therefore rather ominous smile
doesnt take a smart kid like his daughter to guess
so whats up
whos marrying who this time
mommys marrying rache
jackie reaches and shuts off annabelles camera
and the directness in her gaze keeps the child from complaining
simply mommys sick guys
you have the worst flu since
i have cancer
do you know what that is
someone else does
real quiet its what grammy lil died from
bens eyes whip over to his sister
he sees the cold fear in her face
back to mom
she seems fine calm smiling even
grammy had a different kind
there are lots of kinds
hers was very bad
is your bad
shes going to die
but the anger in her eyes isnt for ben
she is glaring
at her mom
actually im getting better already
as if to an equal an adult
i had a lot of treatments and they werent any fun but the tests show the cancer got smaller
a lot smaller
annabelle cuts him an angry look
hes on her shit list too
so youre okay
im still sick but im better
you lied to us when you never told us
ben hadnt thought of that
nods now yeh
and youre mad
annabelle just glares with all the hatred she can turn her fear into
i know how scared get when youre sick
so i waited to tell you
until it was getting smaller
i thought that was best maybe i was wr
if you lied then maybe youre lying now i can never belive you again annabelle never say nev
but jackies raised her hand
jump back jack
the eye contact with her daughter never breaks
we make mistakes
and we forgive each other
because we love each other very m
its thursday we get to be with rache the diplomat id rather be with mommy
shes dying and rache is your mother now
she jumps up from the table
hisses at her brother
you are so stupid
and she runs halfway to the door
she turns startled at the anger in that
you do not run out on your moth
and bolts from the room
in the silence shes left behind
annabelles worse than everybody
rachel and luke cuddled in bed watching a video in the darkness
at least she is
just now hes watching her
well i think you should tell him you changed your mi
softly its no biggie
shes still watching
its a french language comedy
she can feel his eyes on her
its just an assignment
its anna sui you should be doing it
are you hungry
you could make us something
shes still never looked at him
he can see shes getting irritat ed
he says nothing
its two solid months around the clock jackie needs some cover age youre in a trial what are we talking about
therell be other assignments
he kisses her hair and flinches slightly
tries to pretend its because shes concentrating on the movie
theyre my kids
great wallow in guilt you sure youre not jewish
a long beat
he snuggles closer
they watch together
shes not gonna die
i know that
jackie and ben cuddled in bed watching a video in the darkened room
it is not a french comedy
they are however eating popcorn
the door opens
annabelle stands motionless composed
her face looks like shes been crying
she clears her throat
im sorry youre sick
from across the room
jackie stares at her
i cant hear you
jackie cups her hand to her ear
shakes her head cant hear a thing
waves come on over
crawls up into the bed on the opposite side from ben
into her mothers arms
jackie kisses her head strong
im not deaf yknow
they grin at each other
jackie picks up the remote cuts off the sound
and when ben turns to her
singing in the still
still of the ni ight
i held you
held you so ti ight
thats raches song
i was slow dancing to that song before rachel was even born
you think shes the queen of cool
jackie shakes her head
pulls down the covers pulls up her t shirt
does she have a tattoo
just below her navel
ben has seen this before of course
touches it with his small hand
he wouldnt know
saw her in the shower
ben looks to his sister
for the verdict
annabelle shakes her head
she is only the princess of cool
mommy is the queen
she is but an arriviste
a new word apparently
shes still got a thing or two to learn
resumes singing i held you
held you so ti ight
to annabelle you sing lead youve got the voice
she bumps head gently with ben
the stud and i will doo wop
and as they doo wop the back up
sings for i love
lo ove you soooo
promise ill never
let you go
sing in the still of the ni ight
parents streaming slowly in for a pta night
they are chatty tired preoccupied
folding chairs set in rows
parents taking their seats with coffee and cookies
up front a table where a panel of speakers are beginning to gather
a faded banner says pta tenafly day school
jackie is nibbling at a single cookie when
a figure slips into the seat beside her
rachel is juggling a coffee and maybe nine cookies
picks it up
dusts it off
jackie is repelled but has to smile
lukes depo ran late
i promised id take notes
to prove it she balances the cookies on her thighs and produces a notebook
looks around and in a conspiratorial near whisper
so i have to tell you something in confidence
youre a cross dresser
annabelle is over her head
with brad the dreamboat kovitsky
does a groucho eyebrow move
she hasnt mentioned this
she was afraid youd make a big deal out of it
jackie is hurt
theyve been going out for two weeks
rachel breathless and happy
as you may know going out in the six grade doesnt mean shit
they dont actually go to a movie or anywhere they dont even eat lunch together its just a declaration to the world that theyre
going out yeh
i had kids of my own once
he walks up to her on lunch yard today
and tells her
that theyre breaking up
jackies mouth drops
oh my god
which is the whole point of this going out thing so one of them can dump the other one and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy
without ever having to actually date
doesnt begin to describe it
i mean youve got cancer this is serious
rachel grips jackies arm
she spent an hour in the girls bath room crying with eight of her closest friends who are sending the message to every boy in the grade that brad kovitsky
is yesterdays toast devours an entire cookie in one gulp
so heres the point
i pick her up from soccer she tells me the whole mess and asks me what to do
how about that
and you said
ask your mom
so shes gonna
dont fuck this up
jackie and annabelle are sitting at the kitchen counter with maybe twenty hardboiled eggs
they are cracking the shells gently and carefully peeling them
well did you really think youd meet someone at eleven that youd spend the rest of your life with
annabelle keeps her eyes on her eggs
no but i thought till thursday
mans inhumanity to woman
hes pro women
flannery is twisted
i could help with the debate
thinking it over actually
i could only help him
every time im on the lunch yard and hes with twelve of his retarded dorkface little adoring out crowd henchmen you dont like his friends
they all yell there goes the virgin queen or the ice princess or some really clever cut like that
like it hurts my feelings
they keep peeling eggs
you wouldnt kiss him huh
not with my mouth open
softly good girl
annabelles eyes well up
she covers by concentrating all the harder
and what do you do wh
i call him a fartface or a pervert or something equally lame
you have to ignore him
and on this
annabelle looks up
hes not even there
you dont see him you dont hear him youre just too much of a woman to bother with little boys
this is a joke right
jackie shakes her head
all he wants is the attention
when he cant get to you hell try harder for a little while
then hell give up
itll be no fun
the kid blinks
you think rache would do that
takes mom back a bit
enough for her daughter to notice
its just shes younger
maybe she remembers how to do this
annabelle studies her
thisll work huh
annabelle takes heart from her moms confidence
nods with her trademark determination
how many devilled eggs can you eat
jackie surveys the table
we can always go to the store if w
a sudden banging on the screen door
they turn to see
a breathless six year old tucker through the screen
the birthday boy at the recent party
tucker is something wr
how tall is your tree
the really really really really big
how bad would it hurt
if you fell off the top
aerial view of jackie annabelle tucker and assorted neighborhood looky loo kids from seventy feet in the air
everyone looks like tiny dots running around the lawn
we realize that we are almost at the top of a giant evergreen tree
we see a patch of red
and now a blue stripe
the wind reveals more its ben climbing to the very top of the tree
the calling of his name becoming more and more faint in the distance his leg misses a branch causing a cluster of pine cones to fall in front of jackie
she looks up screaming jackies pov ben crouched at the top of the evergreen as the wind sways the tree perilously back and forth
smash cut to later as
an enormous crane moves through the sky
jackie holds tightly onto jessica a diminutive five foot tall firewoman as they soar skyward towards ben
a slightly condescending tone to
thats quite a grip you have there maam
do we have an issue with heights
patronized the wrong gal
in a crisis
looking her up and down i dont care if youre a dwarf so long as you do your job
maam my arms going numb maybe you could loosen your grip just a little
thats absolutely out of the question
the crane stops
ben has climbed to the top branches of the trees they sway from side to side like a metronome
your mother says youre real good at disappearing ben tries to climb a little higher branches snap
mommys so glad to see you now stop climbing
he keeps climbing ben listen to me
i have to get there
ben where do you have to get to
i have to tell him hes made a mistake
he should take grammy martha first
or grandpa norman
jackies heart breaks unable to speak
god doesnt like visitors
how do you know
ask her shes a heroic fireperson
she does this twenty times a day
jessica begins to crawl out to him on the limb
its in our official manual
thats right ben
thats why firemen have giant ladders and climb up and down poles
between heaven and earth
thats good cause we need to hurry
my mom doesnt have very much time left
then you know what we should do
we should go to the fire station together and ring the firebell to get gods attention
cause its an emergency
ben opens his arms teeters and jessica has him
she reaches him out and
hands him to jackie alone in the cherry picker
jackie grasps ben pulling him fiercely to her arms in a death grip
from down below the kids cheer
the worst is over
hold on jackie clutching her baby for dear life
knowing it isnt
jackie stands in the doorway watching her son her baby boy sleeping
she looks drawn but even if her body would let her sleep she couldnt
a whisper god
i will do anything
i will go through any amount of pain you give me
if youll just let me see them grow up
a slow ragged breath
is that asking so damn much
she leaves the room soundlessly
annabelle sleeps soundly in the glow of a night light
jackie appears leaning down to rouse her gently
wake up honey
jackie sits on the edge of the bed stroking annabelles head
i got ginny weintraub to come stay with ben
annabelles puzzled look
why would you do that
howd you like to go someplace special with me
the light of the full moon illuminates the night and we see jackie and annabelle sitting on a horse
annabelle in front jackie with a strong hold on her
both have their nightgowns tucked into their jeans coats over them
hold tight sweetheart
she kicks the horse forward and they head off toward the rolling hills in the distance
jackie and annabelle ride faster and faster along the trail
jackie has one arm firmly around annabelles waist and controls the horse with the other
jackie closes her eyes for a moment allowing the wind to wash over her
the smells and sounds of the night seem to free her give her strength
annabelle relaxes against her mother and giggles with delight
jackie soon joins her and the sounds of their laughter break the silence of the night
they come to a stop at the crest of a small hill and we now see the tears on jackies face
annabelle cant see and stares out at the moonlit valley before them
im never never going to forget this
annabelle snuggles back
never say never
jackie kisses the top of her babys head
youre old enough to learn the loophole
you can say never never
if you mean it enough
to say it twice
so content in her mothers arms
so jackie grips a little tighter
breathes a single word just loud enough to hear
rachel and luke heading up the path to jackies door
it is early winter
stark trees a light snow on the ground
rachel pulls her coat tighter around her
ben rumbling down the hall to the door
stands in front of it as the bell rings again
so he does
gives her a sweet hug
he enters behind her
scoops his body in the air
john wayne listen up
thats a pretty big love youre givin my best girl pard
clint listen sideways
love her and you love her
now what are we gonna do about it
they follow rachel down the hall
mister rogers well share
like good neighbors
they enter the living room
annabelle sits sullenly in front of the tv
her overnight duffle and book bag and coat piled beside her
hey gorgeous wheres big mama
annabelle worried about something
she still packing for her trip
killed my math quiz a minus
they slap five
go through the ritual of a three step black guy handshake
annabelle cuts a look in luke and bens direction
please not in front of the menfolk
ill go check on mom
annabelle frowns at moms name
rachel strokes her
heads down the hall
knocks at the open door to jackies bedroom where jackie is calmly meticulously laying out things beside her large open suitcase
she waves rachel in and keeps working
checking out the stuff its gonna be cool huh
i can never figure weather
last trip i made all the wrong choices
rachel and we have a better angle now
jackie looks awful
drawn weak masking pain with obvious courage
rachel sits on the edge of the bed
jackie turns away goes to her open chest of drawers
even her voice is carefully under control
awkward rachel looks around the room
a stack of photo albums scrapbooks open
works in progress
can i look at the pictures
its a mess right now
thats my project when i get back
so quiet we can hear a clock ticking nearby
rachels gaze returns to the bulky sweaters
see im not going to houston after all
like you obviously figured out
theres this clinic in montreal
weve studied their process we like their success rate
two women nodding in a calm matter of fact way
as if discussing recipes
they combine some compounds that have been getting results in france with vitamin injections
seems to activate the chemo
its promising this one
shes out of words
i really look like shit
you look sick
but you look
yeh thats bull
im going for serene they say some actually get there
the first bitterness to seep through
probly low percentage on mothers
she sits unceremoniously right on the floor
pantomimes a smoke
rachel goes into her bag
you try to center on the big issues yknow
what its all about
what this whole trip has meant
but then the really big issues keep swamping y
tosses jackie a pack
you dont have any pot i spose
rachels eyebrows head north
the primo stuff is great for pain
i think my primo shit got left in my bellbottoms
jackie lighting up
deep soulful drag
she ignores this little kovitsky punk takes the high moral ground
reading rachels face
who is already wincing
yeh hes relentless
a major asshole
nodding and you said
keep on keepin on
rachel tries to hide her disappointment
she has to stick with it
have the patience the guts to ignore the pain
half a beat
rachel shakes her head nope
you oughta know
luke sits with ben building a gigantic magic castle from a million leggos
is architecturally interesting
through the window behind them a cold winter rain
god sorry im so late
she is entering peeling off her jacket
tired as hell
duncan is doing his himmler imitation on this gig
i got yelled at for quitting at eight under lukes patient exterior the stress is showing
as ben watches he replaces a key piece of the turret
yeh well ill be up all night on this brief
he shoots her a really sorry look
ive got a morning plane to boston for the depo
back sunday night
they lock eyes in the bond of what are we gonna do
i made that paella you liked
its on the stove
she kisses bens head lukes mouth that one lingering a little
then down the hall to
annabelle sits with her homework stacked untouched
staring out the dark window
clearly this is worse than death
a bad hair day
annabelle turns like a hunted animal
she told me to keep ignoring him
so i did it
not a good result huh
you know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me now in front of the whole world frosty the snow bitch
thats so weak
heres weak mom said she was gonna talk to the teacher and brads parents can you believe the humiliation honey she wont d
i told her if she pulled that id kill myself and she could go to my funeral for a change
for a change
thats where this is coming from
rachel reaches her arms around her
ive personally never gone to a funeral
and im not starting anytime soon
the phone begins to ring
a whisper specially not in this family
rachel checks her watch
that could be your mom from montreal
now you need t
but annabelle breaks loose from rachels arms and bolts out of the room
rachel watching in despair
lifts the phone on the sixth ring
bright and soft hi

intercut throughout jackie in a hospital gown
at the window of her room rain pouring down on montreal
eat your heart out

annabelle lies on her bed in darkness
clutching her pillow
lights streams in as rachel enters
sits on the bed next to this furious child
puts the cordless phone by the pillow
annabelle i know you miss your mother
so why dont you say hello
why dont you say hello
annabelle pick up the phone
annabelle pick up the phone
that doesnt bother me

suits me fine rachel cooks her head to one side like shes seen jackie do
you think that means you can step on me
that youre one step ahead of me
well youre not
no smile at all
you know when girls grow into women
when they have to
and this is your moment kid
ready or not
picks up the phone
low your mama is in a hospital far away
she needs you right now
she needs you to be big
to put the kid aside and help her get well
clicks the phone on
hands it to her
tears on her face hi mom
how are you feeling
as rachel leaves silently we
intercut throughout jackie at her clinic window
cellular at her ear
darling ive been thinking about our little brad problem
and i think its time we move to plan b
you cannot believe what he said it was the worst instant of my total life on earth i know
i know how rough life can be
and how unfair
so heres what we do
tomorrow on the lunch yard you walk straight up to that little jerk
and bring my knees up real hard yeh
no that never solves anything
you talk like the big girl you are
about what you feel
and how hes hurt you
you tell the truth
nodding to herself
knows this is right
you use your words
an actual subway car filled with pairs of animals cats rabbits dogs two horses peeking out a window peacocks
noahs subway so to speak
duncan and his client watch as cooper assists rachel who shoots the menagerie from low angles
at last she lowers her camera
check her watch
shoots cooper a knowing look
and hands him the camera
waves to her subjects
i love you guys
and starts walking off down the tunnel
duncan looks at his watch then jumps up tears after rachel grabbing her arm spinning her around he faces
someone ready for this
its i told you theres no one to pick up annab
but youre not done she licks her lips
stands her ground
ive got it
its in the can cooper can wrap th
we dont know if youve got it we havent seen it yet
now go back and finish
her glare says do not fuck with me
the mother lion look weve seen on jackie
which part of no dont you understand
look i will send a p
to pick up the children
there are agencies that supply sitters nannies
theyre losing one mother
they cant lose two
the bottom line
he looks as freaked as she is determined
youre making a career decision here i would strongly sugg
ive got an even better idea
she leans forward
in his face
so she barely has to murmur
you cant do that i wont let you
no no no this is a job thats hard to keep not a job thats hard to lose cant be both
rachel dont do this you will never forgive yourself
she thinks that over
for half a second
i just did
and without further fond farewell
she is gone
the last cars are pulling away
some kids are still playing sports
and sitting on the ledge by the flag pole
the little boy is reading his garfield book for the three hundredth time
his big sister is simply crying openly for a disinterested world to see
a car screeches up
the driver blasts out the door runs to us
then crouches slowly
at annabelles feet
oh baby im so sor
rachel is dying inside
reaches to brush at annabelles tears but the child smacks her head away
ben go sit in my car right now and i will bribe you big time
excited he runs off
did what she said
i used my words i told him what i felt and they
they laughed real hard
annabelle nodding big gulping back tears
thats because men can be scum your precious father excepted may you live to find one like him it is damn hard
and wraps her arms around the girl
looking around now is that little prick still here because if he is im gonna rip his fucking heart out
no his mothers always on time
and mom says anger never never solves anything
it makes every thing worse thats because your mother is a fine person finer than i will ever be
now just this once
just this once
if i tell you what to do
can we cut a deal
annabelle stops crying
this is what she has prayed for
tomorrow is friday your mom comes home
you tell her you did what she said
it didnt work yet
but youre gonna talk to brad again on monday
and you dont tell her
what youre going to say
not use my words please
smile no baby
youre gonna use my words
the sun dawns
on a childs face
rachel brushes the tears away
they wont need them anymore
okay lets start with looks
i know hes handsome but the best looking people are so vain theres always something theyre insecure about
annabelle shakes her head
does he have zitz
we can call him pizza face
help me here
he thinks his nose is too big
but its not
big ears too
but they stand out a little
hes a dead man
rachel stands up
walks in circle thinking
strikes a pose
monday lunch you walk up with attitude you hear me
finger stabs out
as annabelle hey ear boy
does the ears listen up rhino face because im saying this one time
so your pathetic no life ass kissing little groupies here better take notes annabelle is swooning with joy
as annabelle dumped you limp dick when i got a peek at your deformed unit which is sadly microscopic annabelle laughing applauding
as annabelle as for your pitiful knowledge of sex im not wasting my time with some loser who doesnt even know what snowballing is
annabelle raises her hand
what is it
its an incredibly disgusting and not remotely sexy thing that they described in a movie id never let you go to
but its real
does he have an older brother
in high school
hell be impressed
the clincher is you walk away then whip around
the guy see is in the eighth grade at prep school and he laughs his ass off every time we talk about you
suitable boy will be at this flagpole on monday with a very expensive bike and he will be a stone fox if i have to call an escort service
now lets go stuff you full of junk food
wraps an arm around her
ive had the worst day
arriving passengers are filling through the gate
last is a female flight attendant wheeling a gray faced jackie in a collapsible wheelchair
the woman leans to her
well get your bags and the taxis are just
jackie grips the wheel stopping them
stares frozen as across the way
three faces stare back
and jackie leaps out of the wheelchair runs across the distance runs to scoop her babies in her arms
its a miracle
i can walk
ben covers jackie with kisses
from the crowd
rachel carrying the suitcase jackie has each kid by the hand as they troop through the house to arrive at
where jackie freezes
her mouth open
for rachel has
hung striking black and white photos of the children all over the room
one is of bens feet left shoe on right foot and vice versa
another glimpses annabelles beautiful face hidden in her hair
ben sitting in a cupboard
annabelle a bold ear of corn
ben sitting on the bottom limb of the huge evergreen
annabelle kissing her horses muzzle
jackie just stands
trying not to cry
these are good
she know he did
looks across the room at rachel
no more words
lets go to the park
smiles down at him
ive got a lot of medicine in me sweetie
and im a little wobbly for driving or running ar
rache can do that part
jackie absorbs that
and all it portends
softly hon maybe your mom would like t
go to the park
in the worst way
grins well with rachel driving
thats how well go
five swings in use
in four the kids are pushed by moms or nannies
in the fifth ben is pushed by annabelle
guess whos going the highest
pull back to
two women on a bench
under a starkly bare tree
jackie is drinking in the air the cold the day
rachel watching that
youre getting the hang of it
jackie doesnt answer for a beat
almost as if she hasnt heard
serene means you accept
shakes her head
part of me hasnt quit yet
and the other part is still pretty outraged
calmly when its not terrified
watching the world of moms and kids
who are not terrified
do i know you well enough to really chew you out
jackie turns to her
diamond laser glare
have you lost your mind you fought years for that job
and you quit oh
its just not the right time t
do what youve worked your whole life to do
it was just a job therell be plenty of others
you mean after im dead
hey you havent quit on you im sure as hell not gonna
i just mean im juggling a lot right n
move the darkroom into your house
youve got that room downstairs with the treadmill luke never uses anyway
dont lose your confidence
dont lose your edge
its the same choice you made
i made the choice that was right for me
and i dont regret it
but even for me there were days when i felt so lost so invis ible
and then id hate myself for the kids not being enough
reading rachels face
softer i know you huh
the car pools he measles the pta
its not gonna be enough for you in the long run
you have to think long term
i just want to spend time with them when im not rushing or on the phone or tired or
thats the job with or without a career
im telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness
they need you to be happy
can you hear me
cause if youre not the easiest person to blame is the guy sleeping next to you
and youll push him away and then hate him even more when he goes until finally you have no choice but to leave
and that cant happen
rachels turn to wonder
she starts to say something thinks better of it
thats the bottom line isnt it
i cant make a mistake
because itll screw your kids
my advice to you
feeling the pressure
rachels eyes move across jackies face
then out to ben on the distant swings
last time pushed him
he said higher rache
it makes my penis sting
now its jackie watching rachels profile
im gonna buy him that white dove for christmas
if i dont youll get him a fucking eagle
jackie keeps watching her
and in a quiet voice
ben was born in two hours went right to my breast and camped there for three days
always with this
watches rachel nodding absorbing
somehow his blanket always looked like a cape even the nurse said that
he loves to hear that story over and over
how he was born a magician
softly never turning and her
she just wasnt sure about entering this world
watches the feeling well in rachels eyes
the doctor wanted to go in and get her but i knew shed come in her own time
thats who she is
dont let anybody rush her
ill keep that in mind
rachel settles back
her eyes now locked away somewhere private
that jackie sensed something
its not about the kids
decides whether to ask
that thing you said before
pushing the guy sleeping next to you away
because of what you gave up for motherhood
is that what he told you
he wont discuss it
just calls it history
a trace of edge to jackies smile
but no real anger
well he got that part right
so whats the part he got wrong
an urgency in that
i got all day
luke and his bulky briefcase coming down the stone steps two at a time until
he sees her
in her winter coat
smoking as if it could keep her warm
and despite her tension he grins heads over
what a great surpri
hold your applause
were not having fun here
and from her face
she means every word
concerned is jack okay
just what she wants to hear
oh yeh she was cracking me up
dishing details of her sordid little divorce
to assess the damage
and you freaked
just like to make sure
that your past
and my future
are real different
quietly well they will be
hard and low imagine my relief
so whats for dinner
why in the world would she t
you took a fishing trip with the boys
liked it so much you took another
i needed some time away
while she watched the kids
then you booked this flat in paris for your familys summer
but she said
the kids have camp
their friends are here
over there ill just be shopping in a language i dont even know
my life and the kids lives arent here to service your mid life crisis
did it go like that
people are passing them
they do not notice
she called it a fight
what do you call it
you told her you had doubts
he looks around
people are moving on
toward their drinks their dinners their lives
can we go sit somewhere
let me put it this way
and takes out her cigarettes
her fingers fumble slightly
it isnt the cold
i told her i loved her
by way of saying you were unhappy
things are so confusing for me jack
our life feels too comfortable too safe too predict able
its a partnership its juggling schedules
when i think of playing that out every day for the rest of my life
dead at his eyes
and he nods
i dont know if i can make it
thats what i said
but i didnt leave
no she threw you out
what a difficult woman
pulls out her box of matches
so now get to wait
a single match
for the first sign
the first fishing trip
shields it from the wind
what do you figure luke
when am too old to be exciting
when your daughter brings home her college roommate
lights her cigarette
as he watches
softly thats a pretty ugly thing you just said
no heres ugly
i love you babe
its just our life together im not so sure about
never wavering from his eyes
but keep dancing and if youre lucky i might just never leave who knows
thats not us
because youve changed so much
he puts his hands on her gently
but she flinches
so the hands come away
you want me to show you the future
well i cant darlin
she searches the lovelight in his eyes
as if she could weigh it
we make our lives one step at a time
we do the best we can
the truth about the future
is only a hope
how about the promises we make to our kids
about their future
do we shrug those off just that easily
that slows him down
maybe annabelle deserves to find out who really broke up her family
while her mom is still around
just a thought
flips her cigarette to the gutter
you got one less for dinner
takes a step back
but it registers
where you goin
im gonna get me a drink
nods to herself
and im gonna drink it alone
and she walks off
ben alone in the back seat
reading his beloved garfield book
shift angle to see
the women standing by the car
rachel looks a little anxious
you really didnt have to come you know
id have brought them straight t
staring at something who in the world is he
see now across the way
a gorgeous boy dressed cool stands holding an expensive bike
and chatting happily with annabelle
in the distance other kids pretend they arent watching
looks nice enough to m
he looks familiar
did he do a calvin klein ad
across the way the boy leans kisses annabelle sweetly on the cheek
waves to her
in distance kids are dying
annabelle pretends not to know that
just walks casually toward us but as she approaches she cant help breaking into a run straight
into rachels arms
breathless it workeditworkedit worked omi god you cant believe the look on his face squeezing rachel tight enough to crush her bones
and although rachel hugs back although she kisses annabelles hair
her eyes are locked to jackies
we have a problem
rachel alone by the weathered redwood swing and slide set
she is pacing in a circle looking like a kid waiting to see the principal
sucking her cigarette like smoke was oxygen
she picks a bottle of beer off the grass
twists the top
settles awkwardly on the seat of the taller swing
hear the screen door open
rachel takes a sip
before she looks up
low calm now were going to have a fight you and i
barely audible are we
and im going to win
straight to her eyes dont be too sure
no anger in jackie at this moment
the ferocity of that mother lion
the strongest face well ever see
now limp dick i know
it doesnt matter i didnt tell h
because therell be oh or mothers phoning me in the next hour or so
and theyll b
give em my number
jackie on the prowl around this swing
stalking her prey
theyll want annabelles mother
is that what youre worried about
looking bad at the pta
you are defending what you did
right down to the ground
lets get to it
not quite what jackie expected
you put filth in my childs mouth
you had her lie about that
that fancy boy model worked
like a charm
jackie cannot even believe this
she was beaten and bloodied and it was going to go on uni
so you became the hero
and i became the schmuck
straightening her spine
you taught my child that i am some limp dick loser who didnt care about her pain
thats not wh
you think didnt have some dirty words for that little putz
you think couldnt figure out some low blows
you werent passing em out
well maybe your version of growing up is just win baby
is a little different
at the swing
in her face
see in that crisis i saw an opportunity
for some real growth
shut the fuck up
didnt go behind your back
the one scored
rachel sips her beer
doing the right thing
knowing who you are inside
not caving to peer pressure or lowering yourself to that level steering your own course
she wasnt steering her own course she was steering yours well thats what parenting is about little girl
they are pleading to know how they are supposed to do it
and you sure as hell showed her
and there will come another moment
when the stakes are really there
and she will look back on this
and remember how good it felt
how easy it was
and shell fight back again
god help me what have i done
jackies voice drops
the softness makes it somehow more menacing
youve turned her into you
and i may not get another chance
to turn her back
suddenly fierce thats what it is
and thats all it is
the hand with its cigarette stabs out
you wont get the chance
jackie back on her heels
a mile a minute
youve got a point there for a change
oh yes you do
her finger stabbing out
you didnt get morning sickness for seven months you didnt breast feed till your nipples fell off you didnt spend every minute of every day thinking and planning and knowing
that your decisions were shaping the people they were going to be
and now rachel
has nothing to say
you are gonna be taking bens training wheels off
you are the one my little girl will confess her first love to
you will see them married you will play with their babies you fucking bitch i hate your guts
the blast washes over rachel
and in the silence
now youre talking sense
she looks down at her beer
all year long ive been watching how you do this
the worries the sacri fices the signals you give them
wants so much to say this right
and i admire you
more than youll ever believe
has been growing
straight to her eyes
for better or worse
im not you
and so she stands up
the swing shimmies in her wake
i cant live my life channeling the one true mom after youre gone
i cant do it
i cant do it
sets the beer down
stabs out her smoke
we have to deal with that
and walks off slowly
across the yard
huge indoor space
wood sided walls dirt floor
high corrugated metal roof with birds flying roosting in rafters
a little girl under the keen eye of her trainer puts her mount through its paces
in the cold air steam rises from the horses body
its late no one else around
down a walkway
toward the stables
a barn cat is crouched stalking prey
we hear a soft voice speaking
one we know
it was like telling her
see him now
standing awkwardly against the side of a stall
that i didnt love her anymore
see the horse still steaming
if i could be sure id always stay
circling the horse now we see annabelles back
she is slowly brushing out the sweat mark
where the saddle used to be
her movements are stiff mechanical
the soft voice continues
she said this thing you call a partnership
the schedules the chores all the things we have to work out
our angle circling to see at last annabelles face
for the kids
the tears that stand in her eyes
the set line of her small mouth
thats the life i dreamed of
and its all i ever wanted it to be
because she will not cry
thats the kind of person your mom is
shes the best
annabelle says nothing
she drops to her knees
begins to clean out one of her horses hooves with a metal pick
the only sound against the stillness
and her father watches
his heart pounding
i complained a lot baby
we couldnt travel wed lost our privacy our chance to do things on the spur of the moment
to live for
the way wed started out
he goes to her
the sound of his feet on the straw
and she said
sounds like youd be happier
if the kids werent around
very close to his child
i love them more than anything
i do miss what ive lost
annabelle stops working
turns her faces away
she said she could never feel that way not for one single second
so he leans closer
she didnt want to be with someone
hes staring at the back of her head
you know this horse smells really bad
theres worse things
at least she can talk
if only just above a whisper
do you know why i never told you all this before
she doesnt look at him
you wanted me to blame her
instead of you
waiting to hear
very softly thats right
she hears honesty
it makes her turn
how come youre telling me now
he gets lost
looking in those eyes
i dont want to be wrong anymore
i want to say im sorry because i am
and let you hate me
if you have to
she swallows hard
her eyes moving over his face
see that feeling
where you feel two different things at once
thats a grown up thing
its not a lot of fun
she shakes her head very slightly
and her eyes water
know why your mom never told you
she knew that you and her were so
nothing could rock that
but she didnt want to risk
the hardest thing
hes ever had to say
your hating me
cos she loves you
cos she loves you she wanted you to have a daddy to love
even if he didnt
now the tears in his eyes
and shes watching that
you know how much love that is
that she has for you
theres going to come a moment
when shell really need you to give that back
and youre just the girl that can do it
the way he says this
makes her ask
now do i know when
strokes her hair
that moment will come
and your heart is going to whisper here it is winds his fingers
around her hand
and youll come through
she stares in his eyes
and dead straight
if i miss it daddy
you clue me in
okay he nods
thats a plan
the dimly chic bar
with its soft upscale buzz
where jackie told luke she had cancer
tonight she waits alone
watching the entrance
nursing her drink
rachel comes into the place
spots jackie across the room
weaves her way through the tables
and she is there
slipping into her seat
not knowing what to say
thanks for coming out
jackie stares evenly
her chin rests across the back of her knuckles
she looks tired but okay
fueled by adrenaline
he says youre checking out
of the heartbreak hotel
the waitress appears
rachel too locked into the moment to notice
she likes a stolie no ice
as the woman leaves
whats this about
because we fought dont flatter yourself
beat i always liked that line
i love luke i love the children
but there is more to life than even love
no there isnt
and i have looked down the road
at what my life will be
and i cant handle it
what do you see
down that road
i never wanted to be a mom
then sharing it with you was one thing
carrying it alone the rest of my life
but you want it
gimme some truth here
the stolie arrives
they wait a beat
the waitress disappears
well its the jack kennedy syndrome huh
you die young you always look golden
the memory kind of burnishes the image and
come on a wuss like me
the stiff who wouldnt help her own daughter fight back
maybe i was wrong on that one
that sits there
in its sincerity
well maybe you werent
and so does that
tears are forming in rachels eyes
here in this public place
look when i said i couldnt channel you
that didnt mean i wouldnt give my right arm to do just that
shakes her head
maybe i dont want to be looking over my shoulder
every day for twenty years
knowing someone else would have done it right
the way i cant
trade you a smoke
for a secret
the way she said that
something weighty behind it
so rachel reaches into her purse
you know i lost ben awhile back
in a supermarket
rachels hand freezes
in mid course
i lost him
i was panicked
you are lying you never lost that kid for seconds you could find him from a coma there is no way
smiles i was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off
doing my imitation of you
rachel still not buying
ben never mentioned it
he only remembers i found him
my point is telling you this story would have been the kindest most helpful thing i could ever have done for you
the smile fades
why didnt i
you hate my guts
passing the cigarettes over
we were competing
yes we were
instead of being partners
watch ing each others back
seeing things were covered
pulls out a smoke
offers the pack
youre not scared youll think you dont measure up
youre scared theyll think it
thats the jfk thing yeh
rachel takes one
eye contact holding
with good reason
they fucking worship you as it is
what do i have that you dont
the earth mother incarnate
youre the hip and fresh
you ride with annabelle
you know every story every wound every memory their whole lifes happiness has been wrapped up in you every moment
i have their past
strikes the match
have their future
by the simplicity of it all
slowly she leans to accept jackies flame
dont you get it
you look down the road to her wedding
youre in the room alone with her fitting her veil fluffing her dress
telling her no woman was ever that beautiful
standing in two pairs of eyes
and your fear is
shell be thinking
i wish mom were here
jackie lights her own
and mine is
her hand trembles as she takes a drag
now thats enough fear for either one of us to kill the other
and no jury in the world would convict
jackie raises her glass
were guilty girl
of being human
and we cant forgive ourselves
holds it forward
in a toast
but i forgive you
and slowly rachel lifts her own glass
clicks it with jackies
dont rush me
white christmas outside the window
richly trimmed tree presents everywhere carols softly playing
the whole nine yards
luke and ben standing at a wrapped bird cage where a dove is cooing inside
annabelle is setting out the cocoa with a uniformed nurse
kisses annabelles head
im gonna check on mom
goes down the hall every emotion in the world is playing across her face
jackie lies on her death bed
she is beautiful and near the end
despite the iv tube the monitor shes gotten to serenity after all
as close as any of us will ever get
time for the presents
jackie licks her lips
rachel takes a cotton lemon swab from the nightstand
tenderly cleans jackies mouth
now edna says you short changed your last meds
you can do presents and be comfortable at the same time yknow
clears her throat just want to be a little sharper
for a few minutes
a few minutes
some things to say
to the kids huh
then bring in the presents
well have big fun
rachel cant really bear this
you know theres nothing you have to say
because they know your heart
you dont have t
just sit me up
nice and tall
bring benjamin first
staring at each other
then rachel reaches her arms around jackie and as gently as she can manage lifts her to a full sitting position
rachel brings the big book
lays it on the bed
jackie begins to turn the pages
her life with these children passing before her eyes
just full attention
fingertips touch the one she was looking for as
the door opens
ben hesitant enters alone
his mothers face is fine and strong and smiling
find the bird cage
standing there rache says its from you
well dont make him disappear before i see him
okay i wont
she glances to the scrapbook
oh look at this
and forgetting his uneasiness he runs over climbs onto the bed
jackie doesnt wince doesnt even blink
nothing for his memory bank but smiles
he looks at the photo
jackie holding a spunky newborn
thats you and me
our first photo as a couple
really staring at it
did you know i was good looking right away
she reaches to hold his face in her hand
stares in his eyes
this good looking
was beyond my imagination
kisses his lips lightly
how many more times will she get to do this
a murmur so what do you think were gonna talk about
straight back you dying
her smile is right there
the secret of it
that only magicians
can ever understand
his eyes brighten
the sadness pushed aside
see when we die
our body goes away
but we we are not our body are we
he doesnt know
maybe he thought we were
if a soldier loses his legs in a war
is he the same guy
sure he is
but you can still see him
this is so fucking hard
but her eyes stay dry
is where the whole body goes away
so you cant see any of it
but rests her hand tenderly
on his hair
what do magicians know
heres the secret
just because you cant see it
and ben smiles
he is inside the secret
thinks im gone
but only the magician
so where are you
she was waiting for this
for a long time
she wraps her hand around his fist
and puts their hands against his heart
a whisper right here
inside the magician
can i talk to you
when youre there
and you wont hear a voice
but in here youll know
what im saying
yes you will
its not good enough
no it isnt
because it isnt everything
and we want every thing dont we
but god does let us keep the one best thing we have together
the one best thing weve always had
know what it is
but he wants to
i love you
and you love me
nose to nose
its worth a lot
will you keep it
with a kiss
luke and annabelle are doing a hugely complex jigsaw puzzle
ben runs in falls on his knees by the puzzle
without looking at annabelle he tells her
it wasnt bad
annabelle looks straight to her dad
there is a moment a silence that no one else could ever understand
she leans to him and whispers
here it is
his eyes water
he takes her in his arms
whispers close to her ear only the words
here it is
she smiles at hi
fear gone filled with resolve
gives him a kiss
follow rachel down the hall
rache wraps an arm around her big girl
no words except a murmured
you can do this
shes not as good at it as this girls mother
you can do anything
at the door
open it and
annabelle enters alone
the door closes behind her
her eyes lock with her mothers
annabelles eyes filled with tears and jackies arms
reach out and annabelle runs to them
they hold each other
for a forever moment
i dont want to say goodbye
take me with you
and annabelle looks up
tears on her face
i got to see you
very softly let me be the judge of that
and annabelle climbs onto the bed
their hands never stop touching each other
saying i love you
theres an amazing thing when a woman has a daughter
one day you look up and you see
you can say
i wrote a whole lot of letters
to each of you
and the envelope says when to open it
like which birthday
when you get your drivers permit
first time you see rome
things like that
things like that
annabelle is beginning to lose it now
so jackie says only
keep bens for awhile okay
until hes old enough to not open them all at once
until hes old enough to read
tears on annabelles face
her mom wonders
are you afraid for me
where im going
where we all go
now how can that be bad
ill miss you so much
thats very good
she nods yes it is
what youre grown up enough to know
is that people
can do two things at once
she brushes at her babys tears
then tastes her wet fingertips
mmmn surprisingly good
annabelle sort of smiles
you can miss me
take me with you
hold the childs face
in her hands
when youre in trouble
have me there
when you fall in love
have me there
said with such absolute assurance
thats how we go on you know
because someone takes us along
annabelle swallows hard
on your wedding night
when your babies are born
i want to be there
will you take me
a straight question
it needs an answer
a shared smile
you made my life wonderful
take that with you too
the presents are here now they fill up the room spill over the bed where both children sprawl
ben ripping the shit out of wrappings like a wolverine annabelle carefully saving her gift paper as if she were going to hang it in the louvre
she holds a tank top up to her chest for her moms approval
jackies not sure
rachel handing up more boxes luke in charge of bagging trash
bens white dove flying free around the room zipping and diving
no one cares
and crossfade to
family and friends are leaving the wake exiting the softly lit chapel into a snowy night
they are saying goodbyes kissing one another going to their cars
and saying her last goodbye
rachel turns to luke
whispers close to his ear
he looks at her for a beat then leads annabelle and ben toward the car as
rachel goes back into the chapel
the room is nearly dark
one soft spot plays on a simple casket
no canned organ music no sound at all
as rachel enters
she goes to the casket
stares down at it for a beat
and just above a whisper
see i told you id do this
now i dont know what to say
her hand reaches out
a finger absently traces the edge of the wood
it seems a gesture of unconscious affection
youd have written it down so you wouldnt blow it
a slight smile
heres where the love shows
maybe we should change places
maybe we should
she takes a step back now to a waiting chair
her hands folded in her lap
we were less than friends i guess
we were never
girlfriends we never dished
what we had
no apology there
its just the truth
we had some battles man they were
world class huh
beat and i dont regret a one of them
sad little shrug
i miss them
of how much more shell miss
weve got our secrets we have
and ill keep em if you will
crosses her arms
lost in the moment
but i wish we had one more night
in that little bar remember
remember that toast
sure you do
her voice wavers
but the eyes are dry
i forgive me too
youre the magician
dont worry partner ive got your back
its what she came to say
lights and music and laughter
theyre in black tie tonight
its a wedding party
up on the stage at the head table some guy is finishing a toast and as everyone roars and claps
so to the bride
thank god shes more than he deserves
everybody shouts the bride
everybody drinks champagne
and the bride stands up
in her white gown
in her hand an envelope
she goes to the mike and waits for the raucous cheers the calls of speech
to die down
leans to the mike
flushed and happy
and oddly nervous
now i know the tradition so this isnt a toast
not for me
the guest list is
but we all know theres one more here tonight
looks down the table at her children
dressed to kill
enjoying the party
my two sidekicks there always bring her along
wherever they go
so jackie and i were sitting around
on new years eve
and she said youre not gonna talk at my funeral are you
it is quiet indeed
and i said ive never been to a funeral
im not sure ill know how to act
her sweet smile
keeps the mood right
but ill probly sneak into where you are
just before its over
nods to herself
fights back the feeling of that moment
just to you
get the last word in when you cant talk back
there is laughter in this room
so she says no way
holds up the envelope
holds it tight
she wrote this
she sealed it up i didnt see it
she made me promise to read it
at the wedding
and slowly luke begins to clap
and others join
and when it stops
i told her shed better make it dirty or make it funny
on my wedding
no way in hell
could she make me cry
they are loving it
she says its a deal
the band plays an impromptu flourish
rachel begins to carefully tear open the envelope
now if its too raunchy we may have to excuse the kids
shouts from everyone especially the children
she has it open
she looks at it
the world watches her sway watches her eyes fill as she stares at the small card in her hand
she cant believe this
mouths to herself you promised
the tears are welling
everyone screams for her to read it
she leans to the mike shaking her head
no big thing really
five words its
the place goes happily up for grabs
a joyful riot of demand
tears streaming now rachel fumbles to pull up her white beaded bag
as she puts the card inside we alone can read the words
hold on this
