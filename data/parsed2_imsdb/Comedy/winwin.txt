written by tom mccarthy its a bitter cold january morning
the woods are quiet
in the far off distance a man is jogging
he banks around the end of a small pond and runs right at us
this is mike flaherty forty two
he is running hard
or at least as hard as he can
suddenly two joggers blow past him
a home made stain glass angel hangs on a window
it falls to the ground
abby flaherty six years old stirs and gets out of her bed out
she picks up the bird and inspects it
jackie flaherty thirty seven is still sleeping
abby walks into the room
jackie opens her eyes
mommy can we play croquet today
jackie lifts abby onto the bed
stella two years old is standing up in her crib crying
mike comes in and picks her up
jackie prepares some food
she knocks a glass over into the sink and it breaks
she looks over at abby who is immersed in her coloring
then she sets the food down in front of stella who is sitting in a high chair
mike enters wearing a suit and tie
how was the run
it was good
abby finish your cereal
im very impressed with you keeping it up
mike shrugs and takes a yogurt from the refrigerator
i dont like it
you do too so stop drawing and eat
what brand is this
its your team
theyre all the same
mike looks at the drawing
it looks nothing like a team
thats my team
thats great honey
are they winning
maybe you should show the team
abby knocks over a glass of water
it spills onto the drawing
honey you cant use that word
its a bad word
off mikes look
dont look at me
he kisses abby
can i have more juice
jackie is not convinced
just a minute
mike walks outside toward his car
he opens the car door
jackie is standing at the door
did you call fenn about the tree
i will today
i dont want it coming down on the house
mike looks at a very dead tree in the side yard
i love you
i love you too sweetie
jackie shuts the door
mike looks up at the tree
mike pays for his coffee and bagel and starts to leave
he nods to a group of five old men who wave him over
he tries to keep moving but they continue to engage him
finally he joins the table
the group shares a laugh
mikes car pulls into a driveway of an old house that has been converted into two offices
a sign on the lawn reads michael s
flaherty counselor at law and stephen vigman cpa mike parks his car as a workman walks up from the basement of the house and gets into his van and pulls
mike gets out of his car and walks toward the back door carrying his briefcase
he stops at the basement steps
mike walks down the stairs
its an old musty basement filled with endless shelves of files
whats up vig
donnas out sick and cant find anything without her
stephen vigman fifty emerges carrying some files
who was that guy
oh that sucks more
hes the plumber
i called him to look at that piece of crap of boiler
vigman points to an ancient hot water boiler
that clanking is driving me nuts
cant you hear it down in your office
i just figured its old
well it is but he took one look at it and said we should replace it before it blows
we just had it fixed three months ago
yeah he said that job was crap
the guy did crap work
can you believe that
that little scumbag
all they care about is getting paid
makes me sick
no one wants to do the work anymore
how much to fix it vig
did he say
six grand to replace everything
tell me about it
i gotta be honest mike its not a good time for me
my business is off and my step son wants to get lasik
isnt he too young
i dont really care at this point
if it makes him happy he can have it
i get nothing from that kid
he has an unnatural attachment to his father
so what do you want to do
well i was thinking we could leave it for now and just cover the file cabinets in plastic to be safe
how about you
i guess im good with that
the boiler barks
they both jump
lets get out of here before it blows
ill pick some up plastic before practice
they both hurry back up the stairs
mike walks into his office
shelly the receptionist is at her computer working
shes mid s and pure jersey
hey shelly how you doing
im a little hung over and my boyfriends a moron
sorry to hear that
howd the team do last night
your noon canceled so you just have a and pm
the toilet isnt flushing again
should i just call someone this time
ill take a look at it
who do i have at ten thirty
mike is sitting with frank an elderly man jotting notes
and you think your son stole it
i know he did
why would he steal your cat frank
hes jealous of her
mike is on his phone as he cleans his keyboard
i understand but thats my fee for that particular service
well maybe i can adjust that a little bit
mike is eating lunch at his desk
he hears a noise and looks out the back window and sees vigman pulling a large roll of plastic tarp out of the trunk of his car
mike on his knees plunges the broken toilet
mike is sitting with leo poplar and his home health aid jolie forty five and african american
well leo remember you got lost and the police had to help you a few times
thats why we brought jolie into help you right
so now what happens
well if that judge deems you incapacitated then you will need a guardian
and if we cant find your daughter then the state
she cant find herself
ok but if we cant find her then the state will have to become your guardian
whos the state
of new jersey
i dont need new jerseys help
i got jolie now
and theres no funny business between us so you know
im sure theres not
lets just first see if we can find your daughter and then well go from there
shelly flips through some documents
the boiler sounds off
clank clank clank
she picks up the documents and walks into mikes office setting the documents down
am i still hung over or is that noise getting louder
youre probably still hung over
leos financial statements
hes loaded huh
yes he is
you find his daughter
that lady is gone and doesnt want to be found
mike takes the statements and puts them in leos file
cant the state just leave him in his home
thats what the guy wants
they could but they never will
its too much work
theyll probably move him into oak knoll
hand me one of their brochures
shelly grabs an oak knoll brochure from a stack
but he has jolie now
she can handle it
no she cant
his guardian still has to make every single decision
its the difference between a baby sitter and a parent
she hands it to mike who takes it and paper clips in on the inside of leos file
i wish i could do it
i could use an extra bucks a month
is that what it is
its in his file
answering the phone mike flahertys office
mike opens leos file
mike and vigman are coaching wrestling practice at the public highschool
they are in the small dingy back gym just off the main gymnasium
this is a no frills program
the team of wrestlers are doing a spinning drill
vigman holds up a singlet
whose singlet is this
what did i say about leaving them around
a wrestler runs over and vig flings it at him
mike and terry delfino are running
terry is the same age as mike but dressed in a better gear
they are both breathing hard
hows the team doing
what the hell happened
we used to be good
yeah well were not anymore
can we walk for a bit
they both stop
terry is completely winded
youre running good buddy
kicking my ass
terrys blackberry beeps
he takes it out and reads it
ive been getting out here a bit more often
you gotta be kidding me
loris texting me at seven in the morning to ask me if i want an antique sewing table that we bought together
i want my fucking house back
is she still with that guy
you mean my contractor
the guy i hired
yeah she is
i can just picture that little scumbag walking around my house wearing his tool belt
he hands mike his blackberry
take a picture for me
terry pulls down his pants and moons mike
mike takes the picture
terry takes the blackberry back
dont send it
i hate her
they start to walk
maybe you should move back into the city
get a new job
shake it up a bit
finley called me
hes starting up a new fund out here in may so im gonna wait for that
that guys starting another fund
hes an animal
he prints money
come on lets finish strong
terry starts to run
after about thirty feet mike pulls up
hes breathing is labored
mike is really breathing hard now
hes making some funny noises
mike just holds up a hand
he cant really speak
mike what the fuck
whats barely audible wrong
he drops to a knee
hes not alright
hang on pal
terry takes out his black berry but immediately fumbles it into the wet mud
he grabs it and shakes it out but its dead
you gotta be kidding me
mike is still wheezing
terry turns his attention
is it your heart buddy
are you having a heart attack
im not having a heart attack
that could be a heart attack mike
you should lie down
terry tries to help him but its only seems to annoy mike
get off me
just lie down
i dont want to lie down
you might be dying
are you cold
do you feel cold
im lying on the ground
look into my eyes mike
look into my eyes
they are now engaged in a weird wrestling match
are you alright
terry looks to see two forty year old women in jogging gear staring at them
an ambulance pulls away revealing mike and terry sitting in the open back of terrys lexus suv
ok dude how long has that been happening
couple of months
the doctor says its stress
did he prescribe anything for you
why the hell you think im doing this
that scared the shit out of me
what are you so stressed about mike
i dont know
is it that bad
i dont know how much longer i can keep my practice going
holy shit mike
whatre you gonna do
i have no frickin idea
ive been trying everything
have you told jackie
i dont want to freak her out
so we just need a new strategy thats all
what about that judge thats always throwing work your way
cant she help you out
judge lee yeah
if it wasnt for her id probably be out of business already
i just need more
is there anything else you can do for money
what the hell am i gonna do
im a lawyer ter
i practice law
and its not like im some i know
i help old people for christ sake
no offense but your pal finley doesnt give a crap about anything but making money
but thats why he makes it

thanks for the update
the office is dark aside from mikes desk light
shelly is gone
mikes blackberry rings
im still at the office
i came back after practice ill be home in a bit
checking his blackberry oh hey let me go jack
ive been waiting for this call
mike hangs up the phone and answers his blackberry
thanks for getting back to me
yeah i was just following up to see if you had any overflow
its been a slow month on this end and i was
the news from dunleavy isnt good
no yeah of course
i appreciate that
mike hangs up the phone and sits at his desk
after a moment he slams his hand on the desk
and then something catches his eye
its leo poplars file
he opens the file and sees the pamphlet for oak knoll
he flips through the file and lands on a particular page and a particular line item
mike walks with leo poplar up the steps of the courthouse
leo walks through the metal detector
mike watches him and then walks through himself but something beeps
the guards stops mike
leo starts to wander away
leo hold on
to the guard can you stop him please
its a very drab no frills courtroom
judge lee is seated on the bench looking over some documents
mike is sitting next leo
seated at the next table is stu thatcher attorney for the office of public guardian
mike is tapping his pen
any word from his daughter
no your honor
i have the two certified letters returned unclaimed
and there is no phone number for her
we cant find her
and she is the only living family is that correct
yes your honor she is
poplar hasnt seen her for over twenty years
shes probably at the store buying some crap or something
mike turns back to the judge and shrugs
ok then as mr
poplar has been deemed incapacitated by this court im appointing the office of public guardian to serve as the guardian for his person and property
do you have the order for me to sign mr
yes i do your honor
then please approach
thatcher stands and takes out the order
mikes wheels are spinning
he seizes his moment
your honor if it pleases the court
i would be willing to serve as mr
how long have you known him
mike is suddenly put on the spot
more like five
and now you want to be his guardian
mike looks at leo and the judge
may i approach your honor
mike collects himself and approaches
whats going on mike
well judge i think id be a better candidate then the state in this case
yeah and stop saying really its annoying
the stenographer raises in eyebrow
your honor i live in the proximity hardly qualifies same town as mr
him as a guardian your honor
and as his lawyer i feel like im in a better position to execute what my client wants
your honor mr
flaherty is mr
poplars court appointed attorney
i know stu i appointed him
yeah well that hardly qualifies him to be leos guardian
whats the motivation here
thatcher is turning up the heat
he obviously wants poplar
mike is starting to feel it
mike looks back at leo who is trying to unscrew the cap on his water bottle completely uninterested in the proceedings
he makes a decision
your honor leo told me he wants to live at home
he has the money to do that and i want to make sure that happens
if the state can do that then fine
counsel knows we cant do that your honor
were spread too thin for that kind of individual attention
but they have an excellent elder care facility in mr
well put him there
poplar wants to live at home
you can do that mike
yes i can
leo is putting papers in his briefcase
mike sits down next to him
did we win
i think so
mike walks toward his car carrying an old tv set
he puts it into the back of his car which is packed with items from leos house
mike and leo are driving
are we going to the park
were not leo
im gonna help you get settled into a new place to live right here in town
i dont need a new place
i have a house
im not fancy that way
but i need you to stay in this new place for a while
youll like it
is that what the judge said
yeah thats what he said
leo considers the news and looks out the window
mike and leo arrive at oak knoll
it is a nice place
mike sits on a small couch filling out paperwork as a female staff member helps to prepare leos room
mike pulls up and walks into the convenience store
he buys cigarettes and walks outside
he walks outside around the corner and then behind the store
he lights a cigarette and then throws the pack into the dumpster
he stands there smoking
an enormous crucifix hangs over the alter
a collection basket is passed from person to person
abby deposits two dollars into the basket and looks up at mike
jackie and stella are waiting in the parking lot
mike is lagging behind carrying abby and chatting with some older parishioners
hes charming and hes working it
he finally catches up with jackie and they walk toward the car
lets go mr
its cold and i need to pick up some bagels for your moms
i just have to make one stop first
i have to swing by a clients house and shut off the water
because its freezing and i dont want his pipes to burst
no i mean why are you doing it
oh because im his guardian
just last week
mommy i want a bagel
thats a big deal mike
were you even gonna tell me
its not a big deal
and yes it is too
i was gonna tell you
you dont have time to be taking care of some old man
jack hes in oak knoll
they do everything
i just have to check in on him from time to time
and who pays for that
it comes out of his estate and he can afford it
i dont get it
youve never done it before
no i havent
so why are you doing it now
the right thing to do alright
we couldnt find his daughter and im just trying to help the guy
its really not a big deal
well it sounds like a big deal
and you should have told me
whats a big deal
ask your daddy sweetie
maybe hell tell you
daddy whats a big deal
mike pulls up to leos house
its a small house in a working class section of town
a teenager is sitting on the front stoop
is that his house
re the young man whos that
mike gets out of the car
mike walks up the front walk
the young man is listening to his ipod and smoking a cigarette
mike approaches and waves
the young man removes his headphones
he has a bruise on his left eye
how you doing
can i help you
are you looking for mr
well he doesnt live here anymore
where does he live
you mind telling me why youre looking for him first
the young man sizes mike up
hes my grandfather
i came to live with him
mike is momentarily stunned by the news
then he looks back at the car where jackie gives him a whats going on
mike is driving
the young man is in the back seat next to abby and stella
so do you live around here kyle
jackie looks at mike who tries to avoid her piercing gaze
and where are your parents
its just my mother and me
shes back in columbus
she couldnt come
so how did you get here
all by yourself
that sounds like a big deal
jackie looks at mike
from the mouths of babes
mike knocks on leos door
after a moment leo opens it
hey leo you have a visitor
come on in
ill turn off the tv
leo turns off the tv and then turns and looks at kyle
he doesnt recognize him
this is kyle timmons leo
hes your grandson
he came from ohio to see you
i dont have a grandson
yeah you do
we just never met
are you bringing me home
kyle looks to mike unsure of what to say
kyles just here for a visit leo
you want to watch tv
leo turns on the tv and sits down
kyle joins him
so ill come back to pick you up in an hour
you alright leo
leo doesnt respond ok see you in a bit
the house is smaller than mikes house
gina mikes mother and jackie clean up after breakfast
mike sits with abby at the kitchen table
so did you call his mother
oh and he was smoking too
hes probably on drugs
what are you going to do with him
were going to send him back is what were going to do
well i hope so
you have your hands full over there
and now taking care of that old man too
that sounds like a lot mike
thank you gina
he somehow forgot to tell me about it
i told you
not until i asked
his daughter should be taking care of him
you have me to worry about
i dont have to worry about him
hes at oak knoll
can we play croquet today
the whole thing just sounds crazy
it is crazy
mike and kyle exit he building and walk toward the parking lot
how did the visit go
he fell asleep watching tv
so he lives there now
your grandfather is in the early stages of dementia kyle
so sometimes he does things and says things that dont make sense
are you a friend of his or something
im his guardian
whats that mean
it means i make sure hes well taken care of
kyle lights a cigarette
kyles is fiddling with kids keyboard
jackie walks downstairs
did you reach your mom
i told her i was coming home
did she want to talk to me or anything
well im sorry you cant stay longer but maybe you can come back with your mom and visit again
if i want to smoke should i go outside
you shouldnt be smoking
but if i do
jackie decides not to engage
you should go outside
good night jackie
good night kyle
jackie nods and leaves
mike is leaning against the counter eating ice cream
jackie emerges from the stairs shuts basement door behind her and slides a dead bolt locking it
what are you doing
we have kids mike
im not taking any chances with eminem down there
theres not even a bathroom down there
jackie thinks about this and then unlocks the door in a huff and walks up stairs
mike and kyle are sitting with leo who is eating breakfast
hey mike could you talk to them about getting coco puffs
i like that kind
sure thing leo
mikes a stand up guy
you need cereal then talk to him
kyle and mike smile
mike checks his watch
we should go kyle
are you going to work
im going home
well dont take any shit from any of those guys
he doesnt always understand this guy but he likes him
mike and kyle are waiting for the bus
mike pulls out his wallet
heres fifty bucks in case you need it
mike counts his cash
i have money
actually its only forty three but take it
you never know
i have enough money
the bus pulls up
well good luck kyle
you too mike
kyle gets on the bus
mike watches it pull away
mike and jackie are sleeping
the phone rings and mike answers the phone
yes it is
jackie sits up and turns on the light
ill be right down
he hangs up the phone
it was the police
they have kyle
breaking and entering
mike gets up
mike and kyle walk out of the new providence police station
so what happened
i decided not to go home
and then you decided youd break into your grandfathers house
you mind if i have a quick smoke
yeah i do
get in the car
kyle fastens his seat belt
so you want to tell me what happened
well good luck with that pal
kyle looks at mike
jackie is waiting
kyle is on the hot seat
mike is watching
kyle can barely look at her
we cant help you if you dont tell us whats going on
is there a reason you dont want to go home
kyle remains silent
what happened to your eye kyle
you can trust us
kyle looks up at them
trust is obviously an issue
i cant live there anymore
with your mom
did she do that to your eye
shes not even there
shes in a clinic or hospital or whatever
im living with craig
her boyfriend i guess but hes an asshole
does she even know youre here
she doesnt care about me
how do you know
shes probably worried sick and just doesnt know how to reach you
kyle reaches into his pocket and takes out his cell phone
she couldve called right
the sincerity of his question is heartbreaking and jackie is cut to the quick
she looks at mike
kyle is sitting on the back steps and smoking a cigarette
mike is sitting up in bed
his wheels are spinning
we dont have a choice now
so what are we gonna do
jackie walks into the room putting on face moisturizer
but im not sending him back until i talk to his mother
she better freaking call me back
honey i know its tough but were not in a position to take care of another kid right now
she gets in the bed
i dont care
im not sending him back there mike
and for the record im not very happy about it either
then we dont have to do this
yes we do mike
it makes me so angry and so damn sad to see that poor kid in that kind of situation
hes just a kid
jackie starts to break
i just want to go to ohio and
beat the crap out of his mom
i want to beat the crap out of her and her stupid boyfriend
im just not sure that beating the crap out of everybody is the best solution
well it feels like it
im leaving her another message
jackie picks up her phone and dials
terry is sitting in his parked car talking on his cell
so get rid of him again
terry watches as a pick up truck pulls into a beautiful country house
not until we figure whats going on back there
have you talked to his mother
jacks left her about thirty messages
a strapping contractor wearing a tool belt gets out and walks into the house
hes wearing his tool belt
sorry dude i was distracted
where are you
are you watching loris house again
terry quickly pulls out
its my fucking house and no
im just driving
wheres the kid now
mike is sitting at his desk
hes sitting in my waiting room
jackie made me take him with me
alright listen pal this is not the time to long that stock you know what i mean
what does that mean
it means you shouldnt be taking care of another kid
especially a convict
shelly pops her head in
i found her
mike spins in his chair
let me call you back
but get rid of the convict mike
mike hangs up
shes in a drug treatment program in columbus
she has five weeks to go
can i talk to her
they said she would call you
mike shakes his head
nothing is easy here
hes kind of a sweet kid but whats up with hair
a knock on the door
kyle opens it
can i go visit leo
mike looks to shelly who just shrugs
you know where it is
just down the street
just stay there and ill pick you up at about three
kyle shuts the door
mike looks at shelly
thats some crazy hair im just saying
kyle is sitting in the corner watching
mike is standing and watching
he doesnt like what he sees
hey rew what are you doing
coach can you get on pill
get up rew
rew gets up and vigman gets down on the other wrestler pill
everyone watch because none of you are doing it right
you want to put your chest into his side
vig does it but hes a bit off
just slide back a bit vig
a bit more
then you give him your full weight
go ahead vig
pill starts to buckle
vig is big
then you ride the crotch and break him down with a cross face
vigman grabs pill under the crotch applies a stiff cross face and then drives him hard to the mat
another wrestler stemler chimes in
stemler is wearing a star wars t shirt
oh man howd that feel pill
well just call you pancake
stemlers a bit off
shut up chewbaka
more like the secret apprentice
what are you ten years old stemler
mike loses it

mike storms out past kyle who watches him go
mike jackie abby and kyle are eating dinner together
abby is coloring
mike watches kyle as he finishes his big glass of milk

she gives him the bowl of corn
ill get you some more milk too
kyle finishes off the corn
jackie gets up for the milk

stella starts to cry on the baby monitor
im going to give her some tylenol
and jackie is gone

when its warm
mike gets up and begins to load the dishwasher
daddy can i watch tv
yeah but just for a half hour
kyle turns to mike
hey mike you think i could practice with you guys tomorrow
yeah if you want
and by the way what i did in there today yelling like that
i dont usually do that
you were right they deserved it
mike and kyle are walking into the gym
i dont have wrestling shoes
dont worry about it
you ever wrestle before
vigman is already running the team through a drill
get that ankle
get that ankle
alright guys listen up
kyles going to be working out with us for a little while
whats up kyle
the team laughs
kyle just nods to stemler
carlos you and jimmy rotate him in
kyle nods and walks over to carlos and jimmy
ten seconds to get an ankle
then we switch it up
jimmy sits against the wall and mike blows his whistle again the wrestlers all go at each other
mike watches kyle
he moves well
carlos keeps trying to grab kyles ankle but kyle easily defends against it
mike checks his watch
then blows his whistle
mike blows his whistle again and kyle goes on the offensive
he gives carlos a quick head fake and before carlos knows whats happened kyle has grabbed his ankle and tripped him down to the mat
carlos looks shocked
kyle pops back up but stays focused on carlos
mike looks to vigman who raises an eyebrow impressed
one thing is certain kyle can wrestle
kyle and mike are walking toward the car
you have fun
whens the last time you wrestled
a couple years ago
whyd you stop
just felt like it
kyle just shrugs and mike lets it go
they arrive at mikes car and mike talks to kyle over the roof
so let me ask you something kyle
how good are you
kyle just looks at mike almost blank
im pretty good
mike is looking at his computer screen
mike runs inside
its a sparsely furnished bachelor pad with all the toys
you check out that link i sent you
thats the kid
thats the kid
i know right

terry is in the den at his computer reading excitedly
he was thirty five and one as a freshman
he finished second at the states
mike walks into the kitchen and grabs a beer
this kid had seventeen pins
hes a killer
and he quit after his freshman year
i dont know
he doesnt talk much
hes kind of a weird kid

im not just helping out the old man ter
its not like its charity work
im getting paid for it

what are the chances that this kid ends up on your door step and he can wrestle like that
its a sign pal

terry sits down at his computer

theres a video link of him wrestling in some tournament
terry presses play
its grainy and amateur but good enough
mike looks on

mike gets sucked in
hes gonna throw him
look hes setting him up

mike and terry explode
they high five and hug
kyle is standing waiting
jackie walks out with her purse

kyle takes it
lets go pal
mike kisses jackie
hey you sure we should do this
whether hes here for two more days or two weeks it gives him something to do all day
unless you want him hanging out here
mike and kyle are waiting
after a moment steve deluca the principal emerges from his office and greets them
they all walk into his office
mike is working at his desk
shelly opens the door
hey mike we got a check from leo poplars trust for but its made out to you and not the firm
ill take that
mike gets up and takes the check
shouldnt i deposit it in the business account
its not a legal fee
its a personal fee
he puts on his coat
oh i ended up taking on leos guardianship
yeah i thought i mentioned that to you
no you definitely didnt mention that
yeah well it just played out that way
i have to get going
he turns off his computer
well can we put some of that in the business account so they dont take our copier back

he grabs his briefcase and leaves
we need our copier mike
and that noise is getting louder
im not hung over today
mike walks out of the bank and dials his cell phone
could you do me a favor and drop that health insurance check in the mail
i just forgot to mail it
yeah its on my desk
ill call you later
terry is walking through the locker room
a few wrestlers and basketball players are getting dressed

mike and vigman are in their office looking over a board
what are you doing here

terry pulls up a stool
were trying to figure out where he can wrestle
where ever the hell he wants right
kyle knocks at the door

mike tries to cover
how the shoes fit
so let me ask you something kyle
you think you might want to wrestle in a match

kyles tying his new wrestling shoes
the rest of the team is sitting around the mat
alright lets go guys
vig you keep time
mike holds up a stop watch
ill do it
terry grabs the watch from mike
you dont mind do you
mike gives terry a look
kyle and jimmy reed shake hands
and set themselves on their marks
vigman blows his whistle and the room erupts in cheering
most of it for jimmy reed except for stemler who is rooting for kyle
jimmy and kyle lock arms but kyle pushes him away
jimmy locks again but kyle pushes him away again
jimmy comes in hard this time and kyle uses his momentum to quickly throw him to the ground
jimmy tries to scramble to his knees but kyle is all over him
he quickly locks jimmy in a cradle and rocks him onto his back
it looks easy
vigman calls the pin
the room is quiet
except for terry
mike shoots terry a look
kyle helps jimmy off the mat
didnt feel good
vigman turns to mike and terry
i dont think we can teach him anything
mike terry kyle jackie and the kids are eating pizza
i dont know why we didnt quit
just the smell of that room brought back the memories
i hated it it was like a form of self abuse
were you guys that bad
mike was average
mike checks his watch
i gotta stop by the office and deal with the computer
no ill take him
we both should have quit
then we could have joined the ski club and gotten busy with allison shepard on the overnights
who was busy
your uncle terry is just silly
getting busy is bad
kyle cracks up
terry catches his eye
terry is sitting in mikes office
a bottle of scotch and two glasses on the desk
hey how do you think wed do against kyle

both of us
yeah youre right
the kid has man strength dude
mike emerges from under the desk

especially compared to vig
how are you value added
well first of all im fun

mike looks at his friend

terry raises his glass
hey what should i wear to practice

jackie is hanging laundry
she hears a phone ringing from the laundry room
she peeks around the corner and sees that kyle is not there
she crosses to his phone and picks it up
it reads mom
she answers it
hello this jackie flaherty
kyle is staying with us
she closes the phone im gonna kill that lady
she sets the phone down and turns
kyle is standing on the stairs
his hair is wet and hes carrying his towel
i heard your phone ringing and
you answered it
yeah well i saw it was your mom and weve been waiting to hear from her
whatd she say
she didnt say anything
she hung up

jackie heads back to laundry room
she stops at the stairs
heres a bucket
you shouldnt be smoking but if you do could you put the cigarettes in here
i quit now that im wrestling oh
kyle walks over the couch and picks up his phone
mike and jackie are sleeping
a sound from downstairs
then a door opens and shut
mike sits up and listens
is that abby
if it is she just ran away
mike walks into the kitchen
kyle is drinking water
were you outside
i went for a run
its pretty early

i like to get my run in early and then drill some moves for an hour before school
so im gonna do it
kyle walks downstairs
mike climbs back into bed
jackie barely moves
it was kyle
whats he doing
is he gonna do it every morning
i hate you
kyle takes off his shirt and stands on the scale wearing only his underwear
hes lean and muscular
he has a tatoo on his right arm and pair of wings tatoo on his shoulder blades
look at those tats
this kid is just fricking cool
the new providence team jogs out to the mat
there are maybe twenty people there
a punk rock song is playing
this song sucks
rew picked it
hes an odd one
hey vig which kid is yours anyway
none of them
youre son quit
my step son and yes
dont get me started i thought becoming a coach might be a nice way for us to bond
he said it wasnt fierce and he quit
so why you still doing it
vig is leading by example
winners never quit
thats right even if it sucks
this team is just depressing sometimes
terry sits next to mike
thats where i sit ter
i got to be near mike
its good luck
i dont think we should fight about our seats in front of the kids
the pioneers are getting beat
carlos is wrestling and putting up a good fight but time is running out and hes down by three points
he tries a desperate takedown but it backfires and the other wrestler picks up another two points
the buzzer sounds
the team gets up to greet carlos
kyle strips off his sweats and buckles up his head gear
he walks up to mike for a pep talk
this kid is good
be ready out there
terry gives vigman a look
can you give me a slap
give me a slap
across the face
like your waking me up
mike cuffs kyle on the side of the head gear
can you do it harder
mike slaps him hard
and kyle sprints to the mat and takes his stance
the ref blows the whistle and the wrestlers circle each other
the other wrestler is clearly on the offensive
come on kyle
take this punk out
under his breath ter
cut the shit
youre a coach
youre not sitting in the stands
im just excited
you know me
the other wrestler shoots a single and takes kyle down
whats he doing
its his first match
give him a break
the other wrestler is relentless
kyle keeps trying to get up and the kid keeps breaking him down
kyle stands up and other wrestler slams him to the mat
kyle is getting beat up
the two wrestlers go out of bounds and the ref stops the action
kyle gets up and mike checks in with him
kyle gets into the bottom position
did he smile
i think he did
thats good right
the ref blows the whistle and kyle explodes to his feet kicking a leg back between the other wrestlers legs
he lowers his body reaches behind him and whips the other wrestler to the mat
he drops down and puts him a double arm bar and runs the other wrestler right up over his own shoulders
the ref drops to the mat and calls the pin
the team jumps up and cheers
im good luck
thats got nothing to do with luck
kyle shakes the other wrestlers hands and the ref raises his hand in victory
kyle crosses to the opposing coaches and shakes their hands
then he runs to back to his bench
mike greets him with a handshake
howd that feel
yeah pretty good
mike smiles and kyle sits down
the next wrestler jimmy steps up to mike
can you slap me too coach
and then he slaps him
mike kyle and abby are watching tv
jackie walks in putting on her coat
im going to the market
ill be back in a bit

kyle gets up to get his coat
jackie looks at mike who just shrugs
i want to go with kyle
its almost bed time
jackie is shopping
kyle catches up to her
he is carrying two boxes of cereal
he doesnt put them in the basket

you ever think about going to college
yeah but just to wrestle
my old coach thought i could get a scholarship
yeah i hear youre pretty good
so whyd you quit
kyle just shrugs
you dont have to tell me
they keep walking
jackie grabs a box of tacos from the shelf
do you like tacos
i make a mean taco
the team is jogging in circles around the mat
mike vigman and terry stand in the middle of the circle talking
i want to spend this week working on bottom position
did you all see kyle the other day
he exploded up
kyle show the guys what you did
kyle is caught off guard
he hesitates its kind of my own thing
so can you share it with us
well its not a move or anything i just tell myself that the guy on top is going to take my head and shove it under water and kill me
and if i dont want to die on the bottom i just gotta do what ever the fuck it takes to get out
this kid is intense
his words really land with mike
so the move is called whatever the fuck it takes
lets work on it
whatever the fuck it takes
vigman claps and the wrestlers start to move
kyle sitting in the communal room at a table with leo
kyle is doing homework
leo is staring out the window
court tv is playing in the background
youre mother didnt want to come
shes a tough kid that one
she tell you bad things about me
but i never believe her anyway
you should shes your mother
pointng to the tv can you turn that down
i hate that judge
i wouldnt be in this place if it wasnt for her
but this place is pretty nice
its not my damn house
i paid for that house
turn it off
you want to take a walk outside leo
lets go to my park
your park huh
mike and kyle get out of the car and unload a couple of small mats from the backseat
you bring the tape
its in my bag
mike grabs his briefcase from the trunk
hey mike can i ask you something
leo told me that some judge made him move into that place
is that true or is he just making that up
mike wasnt expecting this
thats true pal
well because they can take good care of him there kyle
mikes phone rings
but he wants to live at home
i know pal
hang on a minute
into cell phone hello
this is him
can you hang for a moment

kyle walks inside
mike watches him go already regretting the lie
sorry to keep you waiting
how are you doing
jackie it the sink
stella is eating
mike is sitting at the table with a beer
she doesnt even know us
yeah well i think she heard that im a lawyer and i have a family and that was good enough
for how long
another month i guess until she gets out of rehab
she said that craig guy took off
she sounded pretty shaky
i cant believe this lady
jackie joins mike at the table
where is he anyway
in the basement with abby
this is crazy
yes it is
so what do we do
we let him stay
i dont know do we even have a choice
i guess we dont
a school bus drives through the new jersey farm country
kyle is siting on the bus listening to his ipod
stemler is sitting next to him
youre not wrestling
im just nervous a lot
you ever think about wrestling in a match
im just waiting for the green light from coach
but im glad im not wrestling today
these guys are ranked fourth in the state
and youre wrestling kenny randall
he is tough
thanks for letting me know
vigman stands up at the front of the bus
cut the chatter
you should all be playing the what if game
what if he shoots a single leg
what if he controls my wrists
what if we all get pinned like last year
shut up stemler
or ill throw you off the bus myself
vigman sits back down next to terry
did they really pin all of you
its gonna be a fucking bloodbath
its a bloodbath
jackie abby and stella are in the stands and they look depressed
kyles next up
this is kenny randall
hes very good
yeah i heard
but you have an advantage here he has no idea who you are right
so hes gonna be overconfident
you take advantage of that and when you get your shot put him away
kyle nods and mike slaps him across the face and kyle sprints to his place on the mat and gets ready
mike turns to the team
see how he runs out there
i want that kind of intensity from all of you
why did daddy hit kyle
i dont know honey
the ref blows the whistle and the match starts
as mike predicted kenny randall tries to end the match quickly with a throw but kyle is too strong and too good
kyle counters and throws kenny to his back
before anyone can blink kyle pins him
mike terry and vigman explode off their chairs
he just pinned kenny randall
are you kidding me
kenny randall looks shocked
he throws off his head gear and gets up
the milburn coaches look equally shocked
the ref raises kyles hands
kyle runs over to shake the milburn coaches hand and then he runs back to his bench and is greeted by mike
he knows who i am now
mike smiles as the team greets him
jackie and stella are sitting on the ground
kyle walks in
hi can i watch tv in here
yeah but i want to show you something
stella whos that
she started saying it at the match today
so i have to ask those tatoos must have hurt right
dont lie to me
jackie lifts her pant leg
she has a small tatoo on her ankle
i got it on spring break
hurt like hell
whats it say
jon bon jovi
im a fan
you got a problem with that
no i do not
that was fun today
im glad you started wrestling again
no quitting this time you got that
can i tell you something
i didnt quit my old team
i got thrown off
i stole a car
youre dont even drive
that was part of the problem
whos car did you steal
oh my god
it was really stupid
it was stupid
you could have killed yourself
everything just got messed up after that
yeah well we all do stupid things
but the best part is that you got a another chance and now youre kicking butt
and you know who would agree with me
jackie lifts her leg
jackie lifts her leg exposing her tatoo
the pioneers race out onto the mat to do warm ups before a home match
they are fired up
there are more fans in the stands
terry and vig bob their head to the music
kyle looks up at jackie shelly and kids who are also rocking out in the stands
kyle and jackie walk through a park with leo
the wrestling team sprints through the empty hallways
kyle and stemler are battling it out on the wii
stemler is wearing a helmet
mike pours himself some coffee
jackie is feeding the kids
the basement door opens and kyle walks out followed by feeney jimmy carlos and stemler
they are all sweating profusely
mike is about to sip his coffee when terry walks out
he nods and follows the gang
terry and kyle stand side by side holding onto two ropes
mike is cutting down the dead tree with a chain saw
jackie abby watch from the front porch
mike finishes cutting and terry and kyle pull the tree over
mike lifts his arms in triumph
mike vigman and terry are preparing for the match
they dont have anyone at heavyweight
korsic will be happy
tell him now so he doesnt puke
why does he puke
hes a heavyweight
he doesnt have to lose weight
this is a team for the ages
kyle knocks on the door
stemler is with him
whats up guys
stemler wants to wrestle today
im pretty sure im ready
where you gonna wrestle
he could wrestle
i could bump up and get a pin at and jimmy goes
then were only giving up one weight class and we got a shot
vig and terry look at mike
have you ever wrestled in a match before stemler
no i have not
youre just waiting for the green light right
i think now is my time
i can feel the force
the three coaches all look at each other
terry holds up a cup of sticks with weight classes written on them
the berkley heights coach selects a stick and reads the weight
one twenty five
vigman reads off the roster
we start at pounds
depasquale and timmons
well finish at pounds
tomlinson and stemler
im ready coach
the coaches all turn to see stemler already wearing his singlet and headgear
thanks for the update stemler
its gonna be fine
the score board reads
the pound weight class is wrestling
hook the arm
carlos hook the arm
carlos does and holds on for the win
the team cheers
mike turns to vigman and terry
how we doing
with that win were up by five
if stemler doesnt get pinned we win
thats a huge fucking if
i can hear you coach
they all turn
stemler is standing right there
he looks petrified
good job ter
youre a champ
come here stemler
mike takes stemler by the shoulders
youve been practicing for a long time
youre ready for this
you hear me
if you get in trouble out there you just listen to me
im right here ok
stemler nods again
too scared to respond
you are not going to get pinned
you hear me
now im going to slap you
yeah but not so hard
mike gives him an odd half slap and stemler runs out to the mat and takes his place at the line
the team cheers
but then the other wrestler runs out
he is wearing a black protective face mask
stemler spins away from the line and looks pleading at mike
its darth vader
are you kidding me
he does look like darth vader
but in a singlet
its just a mask
you are ready
get on that line
stemler walks over
if hes darth vader then youre the secret apprentice
you got this
stemler buys it
stemler returns to the line slightly more confident
the ref blows the whistle and the match starts
stemler is immediately taken down
terry looks at his feet
i cant watch
its late in third period
stemler is losing
stemler is flat on his belly and hes getting mauled
the ref calls him for stalling
thirty seconds to go
keep moving stemler
reading score card oh shit
hes one point away from a tech fall and wed lose on criteria
what the hell does that mean
if he falls behind by fifteen points its a technical fall
they get five team points
if that happens the score would be tied but wed lose the match on criteria
mike drops to the mat
stemler looks over
his eyes are wild
you need to get up
hes trying to drown you
he wants you dead
but you are not going to die on the bottom
do you hear me
stemler manages a nod albeit a terrified one
now just do the move we worked on in practice
off stemlers confused look
whatever the fuck it takes
stemler almost manages a smile and then he hits the move
its not pretty but somehow he manages to get up and out
the team goes nuts
one point for stemler
the other kid frantically tries to take him down but stemler holds him off dancing wildly around the mat
the buzzer sounds
the team goes nuts
the ref raises the other wrestlers hand in victory but its stemler who celebrates as if he just won the states
he runs off the mat and into the arms of his teammates
mike and kyle walk through the empty hallway
hey im proud of what you did today
that win meant a lot to the guys
it was good coaching with stemler
then he just looks at kyle
let me ask you something
whats it like
being as good as you are
whats it feel like
i dont know
i guess it just feels like im in control
you know what i mean
yeah i do
must be nice
the district tournament
kyle is ahead in points going into the second period
he chooses the top position
the ref blows the whistle and the other wrestler sits out and kyle simply sucks him onto his back
it almost looks too easy
district champ baby
pure fucking poetry
the ref slaps the mat and its over
kyle walks into leos room
guess who won the districts
and mike said he got a call from a college scout about me
a thirty eight year old woman standing in the door way
this is cindy timmons
what are you doing here
i came to get you honey
and to see grandpa
i missed you so much
can i have a hug baby
kyle looks at leo who just shrugs
finally he walks toward her but then veers away and runs from the room
wheres he going
oh hes just had to go somewhere dad
do you want some juice
mike is watching stella who is playing on the ground
jackie comes up from the basement
how is he
i dont blame him
its weird that she just shows up like that
checking her watch and of course shes late the druggie
can you stop please
youre gonna talk to her right
if you dont punch her first
car lights in the window
mike looks out the window
its a cab
its not my fault if i punch her
yeah it is
that will be your fault
jackie picks up stella
the door bell rings
mike answers it
cindy is standing there
she looks nervous
im mike flaherty

abby our six year old is downstairs with kyle

mike starts to go but cindy doesnt quite seem ready
hows he doing
oh hes doing really well
hes going to the high school here and hes wrestling on the team actually
he loves wrestling so much
hes a really sweet kid
our girls love him
cindy starts to tremble
i am so sorry about this
its just been such a difficult time
jackie and mike share a look
then jackie caves and slides over next to her
these things happen cindy
and weve loved having him
mike rolls his eyes
so much for beating the crap out of her
abby walks upstairs
this is abby
abby can you go get kyle for us
what do you mean
he left out the window
mike and cindy are driving
im really sorry about this
you know kyles doing really well with wrestling here cindy
the regions are this weekend and if he wins there then he goes to the states
it is and it could be really good for him
it might even mean a scholarship
anyway i was wondering if you could stay here for another three weeks until thats all over
cindy thinks about it
id like to but dont think i can afford to stay in the hotel for that long
do you think we could stay in my dads house
this is not what mike wanted but hes stuck
we could probably make that work
then yeah i could stay
mikes phone rings
we found him
terry looks into the other room
kyle is playing on the wii
were playing wii golf
im destroying him
dude this kid really hates his mother
mike is driving
i mean like more then i hate my ex wife
mike hangs up he went to my friends house
we can go get him
maybe ill just go back to the hotel
it might just be too much for him tonight
i can see him tomorrow
i think maybe thats better
i know how kyle can be
ill drop you off
mike keeps driving
mike and kyle are jogging
kyles mood is dark
so when wrestlings over i have to go
im afraid so pal
shes staying so you can finish the season
thats pretty nice of her
they arrive back at mikes house
mike is really winded
i told her youd go see her today kyle
where ever you want
she could come here or we could go see her at leos house
she moving in this morning
ill go see her at leos before practice
but i want to go alone
yeah thats ok but kyle but you have to promise me
dont worry mike
mike turns and spots his old neighbor watching him
hows the foot
mike is attempting to plunge the toilet
shelly approaches him
did she say why
but shes here with an attorney
mike gets up and opens the door to his office
eleanor and cindy stand to greet him
hi im mike flaherty
hi im eleanor cohen
please come in
he leads them into his office
i wasnt aware that cindy was represented by council
she retained me last week to help sort out her fathers situation
i thought she just arrived two days ago
how long have you been here
she wanted a little time to settle in and spend some time with her father
so how can i help
cindy has decided that she wants a more active role in her fathers care
what kind of a role is that
i want to take care of him
so you want to move here
cindy would like to bring her father back to columbus
thats where my support network is now
well im not sure thats what leo wants
i already talked to him about it
he seem to like the idea
i understand that cindy
but you havent seen leo in a long time and hes battling dementia now so it puts me in a tough position here
she is the presumed guardian mr flaherty
i understand that
and we do hope to avoid litigation
so do i and im sure we can
now im sorry but i actually have to go see a client so well have to set up another time to discuss this
kyles still coming to see me today right
ill have my office call
come on cindy
mike nods and eleanor and cindy leave
mike watches them go
mike walks out of the convenience store around the corner and behind the store
he lights a cigarette
i dont get it
is it that bad
mike and terry are standing outside talking
yeah its that bad
just take her to court youll kill her
shes a freaking mess
youre a pillar of the community mike
i just cant go back in front of judge lee it wont look good trust me
so maybe youll get a different judge
shes the only judge who handles these cases and if i look bad in front of her right now im screwed
ill have to close my fricking doors
then dump it
give her poplar
it sucks but youve got your practice to worry about right
yeah i do
do you know she wants to take leo back to ohio
she just told me today
youre not gonna let her do that are you
i dont know kyle
whats complicated about it
she doesnt give a shit about leo
they hate each other
you cant let her take him
look just go get ready for practice and ill deal with it
fine but i told her im staying with you guys until we leave
terry just looks at mike
whats your play
i have no idea
i have no freaking idea
shes looking for a payout dude
just buy her stake and give her an exit
what the hell does that mean
just give her some of leos money and send her home
hes not gonna miss it
hes in happy land
no i cant do that
shes not even in his
a flash of inspiration
shes not and she doesnt and thats my play
whats your play
mike takes out his phone and dials
dont worry about it
i just need to make a call
can you get practice started
you want me to slap your face
get you psyched up for the call
i really dont
mike walks into the brick and glass tower
look were all concerned with whats best for leo so im hoping we can settle this in an amicable way
mike is siting down with eleanor and cindy
so do we
good well i thought id start by laying all the cards on the table so maybe you can understand why im hesitating in turning leo over to cindy
cindy your father disinherited you from his will
and im afraid that cant change now that hes been declared incapacitated
is that true
well have to see a copy of the will mike
i actually brought you a copy
mike reaches into his briefcase and puts the a copy of the will on eleanors desk
who did he leave it too
did he leave it to kyle
he left everything to the municipal parks system
he wanted the town park dedicated in his name
he never cared about anyone but himself and his fucking money
did you know about this
annoyed to mike id like to discuss this with my client mr
whats to discuss
im not taking care of him if im not getting anything for it
were finished here
mike gets up and walks out
a smile creeps across his face
jackie gina and the kids settle into the bleachers
a large banner reads northeast regional tournament
mike and terry walking down the hallway eating snicker bars
brass balls buddy
and shes gone back to the motel
yes it is
yeah i think it worked
it totally worked
they opened their kimono and you made them eat the trade
i dont what know what your talking about half the time
kyle is warming up
vigman is watching
mike and terry enter
its time coach
kyle just walks out of the warm up room
yeah he is
the four men walk into the huge gym
kyle is completely focused
this is big time
i bet there are scouts here
and wait till we get to the states
atlantic city here we come baby
mike smiles but then his smile fades
cindy timmons is standing against the wall
she steps forward and kyle sees good luck baby
kyle keeps his head down and keeps walking
mike looks shocked but also keeps walking
mike and kyle are face to face
listen to me
one more win and we are going to the states
thats what counts
thats all that matters
you hear me
mike can tell that hes half listening
stay in this ok
this is your place
you are in control remember
you control it
now go get him
mike slaps him
and kyle races to the mat
the wrestlers slap hands and the ref blows the whistle
kyle immediately shoots in for a double leg
the other wrestler tries to sprawl but kyle is in too deep
kyle lifts him high and dumps him hard to the mat
the audience reacts and the ref stops the action
the other wrestler bravely pops up but he is obviously stung
kyle looks at mike and nods but his eyes are wild
the ref blows the whistle and kyle and the other wrestler lock up
they dance a bit and finally the other wrestler tries to wrap kyle up
kyle back pedals and then literally throws the other wrestler off the mat
the ref has seen enough
he quickly issues kyle his second warning and disqualifies him from the match
the other wrestler pops up and runs at kyle
the coaches all intervene
its a melee
kyle is sitting on the bench perfectly still
mike walks in and sits down next to him
how you doing
kyle stares at the floor
hey its alright
mike puts his arm on his shoulder and kyle starts to cry
mike squeezes him
i dont want to go with her
mike terry and kyle walk out of the school
the entire family is waiting for them
jackie gives kyle a big hug
abby takes his hand
they all get into their car
mike is just about to get in but then he sees cindy standing by her car watching
he shuts his door and crosses to her
why are you here
i wanted to see my son wrestle
yeah well your son had a pretty good chance to do something special in there
maybe even change his life and thats gone now
i hope youre happy
thats not my fault
why do you think he lost his shit in there huh
what do you want lady
i want my father
it didnt sound like that the other day
it sounded like you hated the guy
you have no idea what my father used to be like
he wasnt like he is now
he treated me like shit and he was all i had
so now you want to return the favor
is that it
i want that commission
that should be mine
and thats why youre doing all this
for fifteen hundred dollars a month
isnt that why you did it
this stops mike in his tracks
alright ill tell you what
you want the commission
you can have it
and you dont even have to take leo
ill take care of him for free and ill send you the check every month
on one condition
you leave kyle here
until he finishes high school
im his mother
he belongs with me
are you sure he feels that way
dont tell me what my son feels
hes coming with me and there isnt anything you can do about that
then you cant have that commission
well see about that
yeah we will
mike turns and walks away
i want to see my son
then call him
you have his number
mike sits on the back porch nursing a beer
terry stands in the yard facing away from him
we were right there mike
right fucking there
and now we have nothing
its a primal scream
mike just looks at him
mike watches him
jackie pops out from the kitchen
mike your moms here and dinners almost ready
have you seen kyle
hes not in the basement
ill track him down
what a day huh
terry goes inside
jackie sits next to mike
what are we gonna do mike
theres nothing to do
i cant stop her
shes gonna leave and shes gonna take kyle and leo with her
and you dont think youd beat her in court
its so obvious shes just wants him for the money
mike turns to jackie
he wants to tell her but just cant
i just cant win this one jackie
jackie misinterprets mikes guilt for pain
she backs off
cindy is smoking next to the open window
she is nervous
a knock on the door
she throws the cigarette out the window and closes it
she checks herself in the mirror and opens the door
kyle is standing there
kyle honey come in
im so glad you came
she steps back and he enters
have a seat honey
do you want a soda or something
he sits on one bed
what do you want
she sits on the other facing him
i just wanted to say how sorry i was about the match and if i did anything to cause it then i will never forgive myself
i know how much wrestling means to you baby
is that why you called me
just to tell me that
i also wanted to say that ill do whatever you think is best for leo
then leave him here
where he is
if thats what you want
but i have to be honest im not sure thats what leo wants
what do you mean
she hands him a piece of paper
what is it
its the court transcript from when leo was in court
my lawyer got it
read the parts in yellow
see what it says
kyle reluctantly reads it
this isnt real
the judge told leo he had to live there
this is official from the court
its what mike said
kyle reads it again
he gets paid for being leos guardian kyle
and then he just put him in that place so he didnt have to worry about him
kyle stares at the page
leo belongs with us kyle
cindy is caught of guard by the question
why does he belong with us
cindy judges her sons look and speaks from the heart
because we deserve that money kyle
not some lawyer
youre a big boy
you can understand that
kyle looks at the page on more time and then suddenly without warning pounces on his mother pinning her to the bed
he gets in her face
she finally quiets
listen to me
i dont care about this
its all bullshit
leave leo alone
he belongs here
do you hear me
cindy can only cry and nod
kyle grabs the paper and runs out the door
mike paces around talking on the phone
i appreciate it
jackie walks into the room
hes not at stemlers
this is crazy where could he be
i dont know hes upset maybe he went for a walk
well we should take a drive your mom can stay with the kids
his phone rings
yes this is him
a staff member is at the desk
sir stay calm well find him
youve lost my ward
we are gonna sue you guys silly
hes a laywer
the staff member picks up the phone
look hes definitely not on the premises
a lot of the time they just try to go home
were about to go there
mike and jackie share a look and leave
terry turns to some residents who are looking on
hey folks listen up
watch out for each other
mikes car pulls up
they all get out and run up to the house
theres a light on
its got to be him
do have the key
i didnt bring it with me
they arrive at the front door
mike tries the knob
mike goes to edge of the porch climbs up onto the railing and looks into the side window
leo is sitting in a chair watching tv
there he is
whats he doing
whats he watching
mike knocks on the window
leo doesnt register it
hes not responding
ring the bell
leo still doesnt respond
this is freaking spooky
mike climbs down back onto the porch
should we break in
i have a key back at the office
i could go get it
is he ok
he seems it
hes just sitting there
suddenly the door opens
leo is standing there
come on in
leo walks away
they all follow him
that is very creepy
they walk into the house following leo into the living room
he sits back in his chair and start watching tv again
you ok leo
leo just watches tv
how did you get here pal
mike stoops over and tries to connect with leo
did you walk here leo
leo turns and looks at them as if he is about to speak
the all wait for his reply and then
i brought him here
they all jump
you took leo
have you lost your mind
weve been worried sick about him
about both of you
you dont have to worry about us
kyle walks out of the room
thats super spooky
kyle walks into the kitchen he turns off a pot of boiling water and strains some pasta
kyle what the hell are you doing
have you lost your mind
kyle why did you do this
please just tell us
leo needs to be in a home
this is where he belongs
kyle he needs to be at oak knoll
kyle we talked about this
listen to this
kyle takes a piece of paper out of his pocket
mike flaherty mr
poplar wants to live at home
judge lee you can do that mike
mike flaherty yes i can
what is that
jackie takes it and looks at it
its from the court
where did you get this
from my mother
its true isnt mike
mike cant answer
kyles seen enough
youre just like her
he runs out
they all give chase
mike runs outside and sees kyle crossing the lawn
he quickly catches up to him
terry and jackie follow close behind
kyle keeps walking
hey can you hold on a second
leave me alone
mike grabs kyle one more time
kyle rips his arm away and tries to push mike back
dont touch me
mike deflects kyle and kyle spills to the ground
kyle gets up and starts to circle mike
mike has no choice but reciprocate
would you let me explain
how you lied to me
how you lied to leo
kyle head pumps
mike takes the bait and jumps back
watch the head fake
kyle i dont want to wrestle you
kyle stop for a minute
keep your hands out mike
terry stop it
im just trying to help
youre not helping
kyle head fakes again but this time hes in
before mike knows what hits him hes on his back
mike stop it
kyle is all over mike
mikes trying to fight back but its useless and even kind of pathetic
im trying to stop it
sit out mike
shut up terry
kyle stop it
mike gets up to hands and knees but kyle drives him hard to the ground
hes getting killed
would you stop coaching and break that up
terry rushes in and tries to pull kyle off but hes lost it
finally he wraps his arms around kyle and pulls him off
kyle spins free and fronts terry
terry immediately puts up his hands
im the ref
im just the ref
kyle turns and runs off
he doesnt stop
jackie turns to mike
is that true mike
yeah it is
mike gets up
so whyd you move him if he wanted to stay here
because it would have been too much work to leave him here
i couldnt have done it
then you shouldnt have taken him
i had to alright
because i needed the money
we needed the money
you moved an old man out of his house to make money
have you lost your freaking mind
i just didnt think it would get this complicated
or you just didnt think youd get caught
this stops mike in his tracks
he cant answer
jackie turns and walks away
jack where are you going
she walks away
stemler is sleeping on one couch
kyle on the other
kyles cell phone rings
he wakes up and checks it
he answers it
shes not there
he hangs up
kyle starts to put on his shoes
did your mom just crank call you
so you and coach mike get in a fight because you lost
we got in a fight because hes an asshole
yeah really stem
well im sure hell make it up to you bro
youre the best wrestler hes ever had
i mean hes always been cool to me and i suck
this comment lands with kyle
mike is sleeping on a love seat
he wakes up
leo is sitting there watching him
i fell asleep
sorry for what
thats a big question
mike cuts to the chase
you want to go home
jackie is sitting with stella and a cup of coffee
the front door opens and closes
mike walks into the kitchen
is he here
he slept at stemlers
how about you
youre right thats not who i am
so what are you going to do
i have to go court
you told the judge you were keeping leo at home
so then tell her you changed your mind
no one can question that
i cant jack
because its not true
well im glad your done lying now just in time to lose your practice
thats how we survive mike
you ever think of that
all the time
jackie quickly crosses to the sink
she starts to clean
she breaks something
she braces herself against the sink and exhales
mike just watches her
im sorry jack
i really am
a noise from the basement
mike heads down the stairs
jackie and mike walk downstairs
kyle is angrily gathering his stuff and putting it in his back pack
howd you get down here

i just came to get my shit
they share a look and walk over to kyle
kyle listen i just wanted to say im sorry

its too late
my mothers gonna take him

thats all im asking
mikes sincerity is undeniable
kyle looks to jackie
kyle shakes his head turns around and then throws his bag
this is bullshit
mike looks at jackie
hey kyle listen i want to be alone
without looking at them ok
jackie and mike turn and start to walk upstairs but jackie stops
kyle i just wanna say we love you
kyle keeps his back turned to them as they continue up the stairs
tight on the baby monitor
we hear stella crying and jackie talking to abby
abby just pick a shirt and put it on
mike is sitting alone at the kitchen table drinking a cup of coffee
the remnants of a pancake breakfast are on the table
there is one clean plate where kyle usually sits
after a moment kyle comes up from the basement and sits down at the table without saying anything
he just looks at mike
then he serves himself a few pancakes
mike passes him the bottle of syrup
he takes it and puts some on his pancakes
the group is walking up the front steps of the court house
what are you doing here
dude im your assistant coach
and just notice who isnt here
yeah i got it
terry puts his arm on his friends shoulder
the whole gang is walking toward to the courtroom
can i talk to you
mike and eleanor step to the side
she looks at mike
you know the transcript alone is enough to hang you
yeah well well see what happens
eleanor just looks at him judge and jury
shame on you counselor
is that it
my client would like to talk to you
mike and eleanor walk over to cindy
she is barely holding it together
is your deal still available
mike tries to conceal his shock
what about kyle
cindy and eleanor share a look
he can stay
and youll send me the checks
you take good care of him
i want to say goodbye
mike turns and waves kyle over
kyle look to jackie who gives him the ok
he walks over as mike steps away
he just looks at his mother
she gently touches his face
he doesnt move
everyone looks on as cindy says a few words to kyle hugs him hard and then quickly turns and walks away
kyle watches her go
a croquet ball hits a stick
abby kyle and stemler are playing on the front lawn
dont rush me
stemler hits a shot and the ball goes into the garden
this mallet is crap
you see that
mike pulls up and gets out of his car wearing a suit and carrying his briefcase
whats up coach
thats great honey
kyle can you drag those garbage cans to the side of the house for me
he runs inside
mike drops his briefcase and takes off his coat
how was work
i got stuck at the office with a client
jackie walks in from the other room gives mike a kiss
i know shelly called
oh i dropped off the fan at leos today
thanks for doing that
mike heads upstairs
ill be right back down
do you have time to eat
ill eat there
make sure you do
mike takes off his suit and throws it on the bed
he puts on a casual button down blue shirt
he takes a hard look himself in the mirror almost as if hes steeling himself for something
terry walks in and crosses to the bar
he sits down
can i get a banana daiquiri please
the bartender turns
mike opens a beer and sets it down in front of terry
you want an umbrella with that
but keep these coming
mike checks a ticket and prepares two drinks
so how you doing pal

we hold on mike as he continues to work
