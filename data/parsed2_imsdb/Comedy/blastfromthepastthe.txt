blast from the past by bill kelly and hugh wilson open on a moving wide shot of a mountain range with the distant lights of the san fernando valley behind
begin credits as a navy jet drops down into the picture
push in on the jets exhaust flame
have the words the blast come out of the flame
then there is a slight explosion and the flame intensifies
the words from the past jump out of the exhaust as the jet momentarily shakes
the pilot feels the jet shake
but he looks at his indicators and everything appears to be normal
we begin with a wider rear shot of the jet and allow the plane to move away
then super los angeles before continuing the main titles
a popular recording from that period has been playing throughout
start on a cu of the ham radio antenna wind gauge and thermometer attached to the roof of calvins shop
we can hear military air traffic chatter on calvins hallicrafter radio
then move down to the window where we see calvin webber tinkering with a gadget at his work bench
calvins very pregnant wife helen appears
the music becomes source
for petes sake calvin
weve got guests
i just got to fooling with this darn rheostat
well put it down and come in
you bet hon
they exit the workshop for the house
calvin has left the ham radio on
tower wolf one is five miles from the overhead
wolf one tower
report the numbers
youre number one for the overhead
the young pilot looks down at the flashing red light on his control panel
he speaks into the oxygen mask that hangs loosely from his helmet
ive got a problem here
say your problem wolf one
are you declaring an emergency
dave betty bob and ruth s pass around the buffet table
another period song is playing on the phonograph
just remember dont mention the communists
calvins a great guy but hes a little you know
whats his wife like
oh you know housewife
likes to cook
well i wouldnt go that far
helen has entered from the kitchen with more food
she favors june allison
just look at you
any day now
this is my sister and her husband
calvin is using a cocktail shaker to very carefully make rob roys for the crowd at the bar
its like watching a chemist at work
calvins a pipe smoker
so anyhow this duck says to the clerk id like to buy this lip balm
and the clerk says will that be cash or a check
and the duck says just put it on my bill
polite laughter follows but the guy out of calvins sight line rolls his eyes
helen is in the b
rushing around over serving everyone
he was the golden boy professor at cal tech
but then he starts inventing things
what kind of things
you got me
some kind of special synthetic rubber
and some kind of automated machine
anyhow suddenly he gets rich
i mean rich
and quits teaching
as his guests sample their rob roys
just what the doctor ordered
calvin gives the man his patented thumbs up sign
over by the patio doors
we can see calvins shop through the window
with all his money they could have moved to beverly hills but they decided to stay in the valley
calvin spends all his time tinkering out there in his workshop
if you ask me its all very strange
chiming in he dug a huge hole out there for a swimming pool
then he decided he didnt want it and filled the thing in
and whats that big high fence for
the women look at calvin
with guests one is called harold at the bar
there currently exists a type of neon light that lasts five years
but you wont see it on the market
same is true of batteries
i could take your simple yacht battery and rig it to last a decade easily
well what the heck kind of a marketing system cant get great new products like that out to the public
intense a veeeery good one harold
free market capitalism may not be a perfect order but its the best weve got or will ever have
most of the guests are women gabbing and helping helen out as she removes a pot roast from the oven and busily jumps around the kitchen
what does calvin think about this trouble down in cuba
rolling her eyes oh please dont bring that up
a late guest named ron hurries up the walkway and into the house
calvin is with another guest
id say my baseball card collection is as complete as any one ive ever seen
ron pushes his way through the crowd
pointing over his shoulder kennedys going toe to toe with khrushchev on the television
calvin immediately heads for the family room
everyone is huddled around the jfk tv press conference
there seems to be a lot of smokers
helen appears shortly wearing a hot pad mitten on each hand
this sudden clandestine decision to station strategic weapons for the first time outside of soviet soil is a deliberately provocative and unjustified change in the status quo which cannot be
accepted by this country
calvin cuts a knowing look at helen who dutifully returns it
the plane swoops over the valley and we see the spectacular lights of l
there is a trail of sparks coming from the jets engine
the plane is shaking terribly and the pilot is having a very hard time controlling it
wolf one say intentions
ive got secondaries of an engine fire and ill need to find a clear area to eject
roger wolf one
can you make it to the ocean
the trembling plane circles to the west
return to tv
we will not prematurely or unnecessarily risk the cost of worldwide nuclear war in which even the fruits of victory would be ashes in our mouth
but neither will we shrink from the risk at any time it must be faced
to helens embarrassment calvin is ushering all the guests to the front door
helen is passing out hats and purses
she and calvin speak simultaneously somewhere in the middle we cut outside
im sorry everyone but given this extraordinary turn of events i think its prudent that we cut the evening short
im sure this cuban thing will resolve itself but in the meantime
id suggest taking a prayerful watch and wait stance
well do this again
maybe next week
heres your hat
could i wrap something up for you
did you have a coat
helen can barely get a good night out before calvin shuts the door
following their wives out
sotto to bob whatd i tell ya
bob whistles softly
calvins a nut all right
calvin turns to helen a grave expression on his face
misinterpreting holding her stomach time
oh no calvin
its not time yet
i still have he points down
helen contd oh that time
you know calvin im not sure im really ready for this
on the contrary i think were the only ones who are
he leads her out of shot
calvin im sure everythings going to be all right
i just know it is
calvin and helen leave the house cross the patio and hurry to the shop
back in the house the record player has been left on how much is that doggie in the window
helen is carrying the pot roast which is wrapped in foil
well im certainly not going to let the pot roast go to waste
could you just put that seat cover back on that lawn chair
helen contd shouldnt we at least turn off the phonograph
it shuts off automatically
did you rig it to do that
youre so clever
they all do
i never know anymore
the sound of the trainer jet makes a low pass over calvins house
calvin sticks his head out the door and looks up
i bet thats a fighter jet on his way to key west
good luck amigo
the place is full of tools and gadgets mostly construction equipment
the ham radio is still on
an emergency has been declared
i repeat an emergency has been declared
calvin and helen speak over the tower who is telling other aircraft in the vicinity to clear the area
you hear that
calvin unplugs the radio and quickly wraps the cord
we can listen to the rest downstairs
he pushes aside a table that is hiding a hatch in the floor and unlocks it by turning the hatchs wheel
then he opens the hatch and reaches inside to turn on a light
red submarine light shines up from below
all the while he and helen are chatting calvin i wish you would have at least let me do the dishes
its not going to be that easy getting all that dried on food off my nice plates
i just hope those plates arent radioactive by tomorrow morning
cheese is particularly troublesome
worse than your kraft holiday dip
oh much worse
but not as bad as that mexican jumping bean dip
you remember that
give me the roast and watch your step
ill come back for the radio
she steps into the hatch and onto a ladder
the young pilot is bouncing around the now smokey cockpit
tower say again
the sar helo is airborne with you in sight
im marking the radial for five and ejecting
roger wolf one
the pilot rights the plane points the joy stick and reaches for the ejection handles between his legs
the pilot ejects
this is the pilots pov were there a pilot
we see the coastline and we notice that the plane is making a
u turn away from the water and back towards the valley
streaking back to the valley with a dramatic tail of sparks
he notices that his plane is headed directly at him
it misses him by a matter of yards
taking the liberty of a cutaway section we follow them down the ladder which is inside a corrugated metal tube
on either side of the tube we see layers of dirt
how long will we have to stay down here
i dont know
for this thing to blow over it could take days
rather safe than sorry
thats my motto
but what if i go into labor
that could happen any time
ive read up on it
ill deliver the baby myself if i have to
now you listen to me calvin webber when this baby comes youre going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers
chuckling yes dear
as long as weve got that straight
it completes its turn and streaks skyward at a degree angle to the ground
until it sputters and the engines stop
then after a road runner like beat or two it begins to fall directly back to earth tail first
the webbers step off a metal ladder and face a vault like chrome hatchway
calvin opens the six inch thick door by pushing another switch on his small box
helen takes the roast
with only the sound of wind the jet continues to fall as the lights of the valley rush up to meet it
they step into a darkened room
with arms spread home sweet home
to you maybe
calvin flicks a wall switch and we hear a series of lights coming on
the echoes of the sounds suggest a large cavernous space
all we can see is the cinder block wall behind them and the hatch door which calvin begins to shut by putting his body into it
just then there is a tremendous double explosion from above which knocks them to the floor
note helen hangs on to the roast trying her best not to drop it
the begin to crash down into the anteroom
calvin struggles to his feet and gets the vault door shut just in the nick of time
what was that
are you all right
hanging on to the roast she nods vigorously trying to be brave
yes i think so
calvin hurries to a bright red metal box on the wall
next to the box is a large thermometer or gauge thats labeled radiation count
there are other gauges that are dropping to zero
look at that heat
all my surface indicators are knocked out
oh my lord
its actually happened
the box has a dial on it next to which is a large lever
a foreboding sign reads hatchway time locks use extreme caution
calvin pulls the lever
the chrome and steel exit hatchway automatically locks with great noise precision and
there is the sound of a rear door doing the same thing
whats that noise
to keep us from trying to leave
after an atomic blast theres a radiation half life that lasts thirty five years
thirty five years
then after that its safe
she continues to stare at him
to go up
to go up
she continues to stare at him
confidently hey honey
dont you worry
were going to be just fine
helen bursts into tears
two police detectives levy and atkinson exit the house
uniformed workers carefully carry small pieces of the jet from the crash site
the detectives lead us to whats left of calvins shop
its mostly a charred crater
according to caltech this webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase
well he and mrs
nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit
unless we get a postcard or somethin thats my guess
what about relatives
all back east
the neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here
shed bring him sandwiches and hot dr
he drank it hot
helen awakes alone and still dressed
she sits up and trys the phone on the night table
it is dead
she hangs up and exits
calvin is making sandwiches from the pot roast
two empty doctor pepper bottles sit next to the stove where calvin is heating the soda
he sees helen enter the livingroom
we have to be strong sweetheart
if not for ourselves for the child
all our friends
he enters with her sandwich and a cup of dr
burnt to a crisp
indicating sandwiches ive given you the most well done cut
im not hungry
leaving no calvin youre favorite
she walks out onto the patio
she rubs her arms as if cold
a bit chilly
temperatures a nice degrees
he follows her out to the patio
maybe ive just got the creeps
how could you
this is just like home
a reverse angle shows for the first time the rest of the fallout shelter which looks very different from home
perhaps she starts to cry again
calvin this is different
would you like a tranquilizer
you have tranquilizers
i told you
ive got everything
helen groans in pain
now its time
we can only hear adams entrance into the world
there is helens pain followed by adams cry followed by calvins rejoicing
the first child to be born on earth after the annihilation
start on the record player in the living room
the country and western classic hey good looking is spinning
calvin walks through checking things over pleased by what he sees
hey good looking continues
calvin checks the switch he uses to control the lights
then he checks out all the tiny fish swimming in the six feet by six feet tank
when he hears a babys cry he hurries away
music continues calvin enters and smiles with great affection at his family helen and a newborn son cradled next to her in bed
is there a problem
what shall we call him
helen contd well i was thinking
in light of the situation
that we should call him adam
thats not sacrilegious is it
i think its just right
and i was wondering
if i could have a
whatever you want helen
she points upwards
i want a bedroom ceiling
they both look up
then he tells her
youve got it
calvin happily gives her his patented thumbs up sign
arriving we looked all over for you
what are you doing back here
oh i was just examining this rear hatchway
then off her look well its pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off
so you know when the time is up well have to return to the surface using you know this back entrance
which is very nice because it has the service elevator
unless it caved in too
a sober beat then calvin contd you wanted to see me
helen nods vigorously
she sets adam one year old down on his wobbly little legs steadying him at the shoulders
go to daddy adam
go to daddy
and adam takes his first step
and then another
its a joyous event
a sign tells us that this is the future site of moms some workmen with shovels have discovered the rear shelter doors where they have been digging
the construction boss comes over for a look
what do you make of this
damn if i know
i bet its some kinda septic tank
ive never seen a septic tank that looked like that
well dont fool with it
if it is a septic tank i sure as hell dont want to open it
well just lay the foundation over it
a realtor steps out with a couple looking to buy the house
and since its almost certain that the webbers were killed the bank is selling the house and that back parcel over there thats been re zoned commercial
its right there on the avenue
is that where the plane crashed
she points out to a level lawn where the shop used to be
we can see the malt shop construction crew beyond that
yep right there
this place gives me the willies
yeah i know what you mean
but the price is right
the guy driving the heavy front loader lets the bucket slam to the ground hard
calvin vaguely hears the noise made by the front loader
calvin smokes his pipe and enjoys a manhattan cocktail as adam three and a half sits in his lap reading the title page from alice in wonderland
al ice in won der lan
calvin smiles pridefully over at helen who works intensely on the couch making a coffee can santa from instructions in the the redbook crafts collection
not bad for a three and a half year old
id like to see the public school system match that
i dont care how terrific it is
yes hes very bright dear
much like his father
but you know calvin maybe hes a little
young for school
people have no idea what the human mind is capable of
look at us
helen ponders that statement
pointing to the books art work look daddy
alice went down a hole just like us
calvin smiles and messes up adams hair
adam contd will i ever get to go up on top
yes you certainly will
and youll find a nice girl and rebuild america
just the way it used to be
oh calvin im not sure we should be making promises that perhaps cant be kept
i believe there will be other survivors
in fact im guessing theres life on the surface even now
its not life worth living perhaps but believe me somethings moving around up there
and i dont just mean the cockroaches
they both look nervously up at the ceiling
cars pass by on the busy avenue
clean cut surfer kids are being served their favorite ice cream and malt treats by mom herself and a young soda jerk
appropriate music comes from the jukebox
im going to need two more banana splits and a cherry coke
you bet mom
two young men in beatle haircuts enter
everyone looks at them in amazement
perhaps there is also a record change here
calvin is building and furnishing a classroom from materials available to him
he has had the forethought to bring down the books needed for his childs education
little adam is watching him
to adam nothing in the world is more fun than learning new things
the family watches the same honeymooner clip they watched before
calvin still finds it funny
helen wonders about that
helen is pouring cooking sherry into an empty listerine bottle
other buildings have been constructed around the malt shop
foot and car traffic are heavier
the clean cut kids have been replaced by flower children
mom hasnt put a lot back into the decor but she has made concessions to the fashions of the time
the jukebox plays something appropriate
mom and the jerk are five years older
i cant tell the boys from the girls anymore
its like hard
mom gives the jerk a suspicious look
calvin is giving adam a boxing lesson
they work from a how to book and use gloves made from living room pillows
adams pretty good
helen appears and watches with pride
then she interupts
excuse me but i believe its my turn
holding out her hand adam
he goes to her
the hydroponic garden area is empty
a perry como song begins and adam and helen enter waltzing
adam has changed shirts and combed his hair
somewhere calvin is watching with pride
after a while calvin cuts in
he and helen dance beautifully
then they kiss
somewhere adam is watching with pride
the place continues its decline
acid rock plays loudly
mom and the jerk serve the smallish crowd
i miss those nice flower power kids
how bout you
after studying her for some time um
the acid rock song ends and an early bad disco hit comes on the jukebox
what the hell kind of music is that
the jerk puts his hands to his ears he so hates the new music
im like not sure i like that
the room looks like ricky nelsons class
there are twin pictures of ike and jfk on the wall
adam is eleven
this is what money looks like
it comes like this in coin or like this in paper
or you can have an investment
these are stock certificates that we bought in your name
of course theyre worthless now but at one time they were quite valuable
can i have them
now lets move on to our french exam
latin exam dad
its tuesday already
by gosh time flies doesnt it
en arte voluptus
que les bons temps roule
gerade aus dann links
sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren

marveling you know you have a wonderful sense of humor son
i must say the acorn doesnt fall very far from the tree
by the way its time i gave you something
come with me
adam follows his dad out
they pass helen who is absentmindedly poking at the puck with a stick
shes not having a very good day
she wears her hair dryer but its not plugged in
calvin hands adam a cigar box
adam opens it to see calvins remarkable baseball card collection
these are wonderful
its my entire baseball collection
its yours now
its a game son
i can explain it pretty easily
theres a pitcher
like a painting
chuckling no son
like one of moms
theres a man who throws the ball to a man who has a bat
the nocturnal flying mammal
slightly pissed no
start close on flashing roller skates
then cut wider to show adam roller skating
he passes helen who has fallen asleep knitting in one of the lawn chairs
then adam passes calvin who is on a ladder soldering a leaking ceiling pipe
two punks with spiked green hair enter to the strains of my sharona
mom watches the punks enter
then crosses to the soda jerk who now has a tattoo on his forehead
im selling this place
i want out of this hell hole
could i like
buy it from me
yeah thats it
ill give it to ya no money down
the neighborhood has gone to hell anyway
she walks off
helen has prepared a birthday cake
having no birthday candles shes used three votive candles
we can hear calvin and adam talking in the dining room
she and calvin are now in their s
the runner on second goes to third
hes out there
because hes forced out at third
its a force
then why go there
because he must
calvin contd yes dear
get the presents and do the lights
calvin leaves while helen lights the candles
the whole shelter goes dark
calvin returns with two presents wrapped in whatever is available
helen and calvin enter singing happy birthday
we see the adult adam for the first time in silhouette
his handsome face is revealed to us when the cake is placed before him
thank you mom
blow out the candles
make a wish
he does both
his parents clap
helen takes one of the presents from calvin and gives it to adam
he unwraps it
its a green coat
your mom made that all by herself
aside to calvin who else would have done it
and i made these
he gives adam the second present
adam tears off the paper to find a pair of roller skates that calvin has redesigned
the new skates look kind of like rollerblades
what the heck are these
your roller skates
i redesigned them
i think this new design will work even better
these are really swell
i mean swell
what did you wish for adam
if he tells it wont come true
oh thats just a bunch of baloney
we never believed that in my family
well we did in my family
i wished i could meet a girl
his parents dont have a reply for that
a nice one i hope
one who doesnt glow in the dark
what a thing to say
well well be going up in two years
well know then
im very hopeful
ardently me too
his parents stare at him for a beat then lets eat our cake
lets dig in
you never know
you may someday dine at the white house with the president
if we still have one
you know when we do go up
im going to miss this old place
how bout you hon
after a beat would you excuse me
helen rises and exits
helen enters and goes into the generator room
through the glass we can see and hear her scream
straightening her hair and feeling much better she exits as calvin strolls by wearing his tool belt
shes headed out
in the generator room again
it just fascinates me how all these things work
i know exactly what you mean
then hey honey
she turns to him
he gives her his patented thumbs up sign
calvin contd great cake
she smiles wanely and leaves
he shuts the generator door she left open
the room is quiet and empty
the star burst wall clock on the paneling says
and with meager supplies on the shelves
the old pipes are rusted and patched
some are leaking badly
calvin wakes up
he looks over at helens bed
she wakes up
then jumps out of bed
that has been ticking on the wall for thirty five years
suddenly it stops ticking and a rather annoying alarm goes off
calvins hand reaches up and turns it off by throwing the lever up
another angle shows us the mechanism on the front hatchway switch to open with a loud vault like move
reveals the family in their pajamas standing in front of the front hatchway and red box
we just open this door and go up
calvin grabs a handle and using all his strength opens the front entrance hatch
and then must jump back when nothing but earth and rock pour into the room
is that supposed to happen
his parents take a beat then race off like maniacs through the entire shelter to the back hatch door
they knock over whatever gets in their way as they go
hey where are we going
is everything all right
calvin and helen arrive followed by adam who cant possibly share his parents deep concerns
everyone is out of breath
should we say a little prayer first
just open the door
calvin attempts to open the big hatch but cant
adam helps him
helen pitches in
slowly with lots of squeaking the door opens
he steps through the hatch and flips a wall switch
red submarine lights come on
and the service elevator is intact
helen steps through and embraces calvin joyfully
the old folks break into a dance as adam enters
well do we just go on up
quickly back to business and way too dramatic no son
we wait for night
is precisely when
we must be at our
barely a whisper but definitely tired of his oh shit
helens eyes widen and her hand flies up to her mouth
she is just as shocked as calvin
helen thomas webber
maybe we have been down here a little too long
to adam please excuse her french
shit is a french word
yes yes it is
its an archaic colloquialism roughly meaning
there is a pause then cest bon monsieur
cars flash by in a rare l
all thats left of moms is an empty building with a painted out front window and a for sale or rent sign
theres another shop attached to it camera right but we cant see what it is
the alley way on the left has always been there
two drunk bums are sharing a bottle
one of them is the soda jerk now a dissipated middle aged man with a tattoo on his forehead
all of these things
theres a heroin anonymous
all of these things
ask you to believe in a power greater than yourself
some sort of god on high
i have lifted my eyes skyward a time or two
and i have certainly not seen anything coming from up there except a goddamn airplane that i cant afford to get on
the cement floor of the old malt shop begins to quiver earthquake
let her come
lets get this over with
and please if there is a god let it be worse in bel air
the other bum staggers to his feet and splits for a back window
soda jerk is fearless
until finally the hydraulic doors of the back entrance split the floor with an eerie struggling whine and large chunks of cement go flying
then up comes red submarine light followed by calvin in his big yellow suit with geiger counter ticking
oh god save me
for i have seen the light
calvin raises his hand and yells through his mask
i come in peace
the soda jerk faints
calvin sounding like a deep sea diver and having to walk like frankenstein goes over to the soda jerk and studies his face in the light of his flashlight
he is horrified by what he sees
calvin looks around the room and heads for the back
he moves his geiger counter around and gets a quiet safe reading
then he removes a kitchen match from a plastic container and strikes it against the wall
the match burns so calvin takes off his hood and visor and breathes the air
it stinks in there
calvin out of the head gear and top of the suit slowly pushes the door open and steps out
hes surprised to find an empty body shop behind the malt shop where the avocado trees should be
where is my backyard
he points his flashlight around and heads for the alley to his left
derelict cars left over from the body shop sit against a fence
calvin marvels at the cars even in their present condition
in a tighter shot he studies the chrome plated word toyota
a homeless man arrives to search through the garbage
calvin hurries back towards the avenue
calvin emerges from the alley that separates the malt shop from another storefront perhaps now a rundown thai restaurant
watching the cars fly by on the wet avenue
suddenly a cross dressing street walker steps up to him with a cigarette
you got a light honey
yes ive got a light
fumbling he finally gets her little cigar lighted with one of his kitchen matches
survived the blast did you
honey i have survived a host of things
like the song says a country boy can survive
yes yes the song
so tell me
has it been
hell up here
hell up here
honey its been hell up here down there and over yonder
yes i can tell that just looking around
did you say you were a country boy
cute little old man if you want a boy i can be a boy
and if you want a girl i can be a girl
i can be anything you want me to be
and its all yours for the remarkably low price of only
and if you act now i might even throw in some free lawn furniture
stumbling away from her no i cant
i have to go
i have to
he breaks into a trot heading up the street past a seedy bar used to be the convenience store just as a hopelessly drunk hag of a woman is shoved
out and told to stay out
calvin watches as the woman stumbles to the curb where she tosses her cookies
two low riders hop by full of taunting young hispanic gang members one of whom brandishes a pistol and just for fun points it at calvin
when calvin sees the pistol he ducks into the adult bookstore
the young gang member pulls the trigger and we not calvin see that the realistic looking pistol is really a water gun
calvin races in and gathering himself addresses the pakistani man behind the counter
how are you this evening
mind if i you know browse around
the clerk just watches him
thank q very much
then calvin turns and has his first look at the material
and he grabs his heart and screams and falls back knocking over a whole row of videos and magazines
calvin sits at the breakfast table still breathing hard and holding his chest
his family looks on with great concern
the anti radiation suit and gear is piled in the corner
im going to give it to you straight
theres no point in beating around the bush
there were survivors
apparently the fallout has created
a subspecies of mutants
its not a pretty sight
some eat out of garbage cans
cover your ears son and hum
i mean that literally and i mean right now
adam covers his ears and hums
they can be both masculine and feminine
i dont believe it
helen copes by moving around the kitchen doing things that dont need to be done
he tried to sell me his body helen
beat they offer lawn furniture as a come on
she slumps then resumes her needless activity
calvin takes adams arm and the son drops his hands and stops humming
theyve done a lot of re building but society at least as we knew it has utterly collapsed
people throw up in the streets
others point guns
theres something terribly wrong with the automobiles and
i cant tell you the rest
i just cant
oh my oh my oh my
so what do we do now
we stay down here
she hurries into the living room
helen lets out a silent scream then hurries back into the kitchen
for how long
weve just about run out of everything
well make do
im of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then rising no calvin
were not going to make do
were going up no matter what
we deserve it
even if its terrible
well i am the head of this household i want him to at least see the sky
and we will and the ocean
a mountain range
do as i say
breathing heavily calvin suddenly clutches at his chest in great pain and collapses
oh my goodness
lets get him into the bedroom
then helen comes out
behind her we can see calvin sleeping in his bed
she heads for the living room
he seems to be doing all right now
i dont know if hes had a heart attack or just
a horrifying experience
but we need supplies and ive got to stay with him
ill go up
they go through the living room and cross to the patio
im afraid youve got to
ill be all right
patting his cheek youre my brave boy
helen hands him a pencil and pad
adam follows her to the fish farm
just act normal
if anybody asks simply say youre from out of town and that youre in town on business
write that down
helen contd im going to give you a shopping list and some money
we need just enough things to get us through the next year or two
and youll find most of these items at what used to be called a grocery store or a hardware store
write that down
at the fish tank helen pulls up a slim chain that is attached to a water tight aluminum box which she quickly opens
the box contains in wrapped one hundred dollar bills
helen takes half of it
i dont know how far youll have to travel to find supplies but if you cant get home by nightfall i want you to look for something called a holiday
write that down
its a hotel
there might still be one standing
lets get you packed
she heads back for the house
indicating money i just hope this is still good up there
i was thinking that uh
you know while i was up there and all
that maybe i could you know
try to meet a girl
ive been thinking about that a little
just these last
fifteen years or so
they have stopped by the garden
oh adam that would be wonderful if you could find a girl
one whos not a mutant
and hopefully comes from pasadena
nothing against valley girls but in my day anyhow the girls from pasadena i dont know
always just seemed a little nicer
oh theres also a thing called a liquor store
write that down
he is packing
he looks at his cigar box and opens it
he studies the contents the cards stock certificates and an old photo of his parents
he decides to pack the box
helen enters with a long shopping list
heres the shopping list and which should take care of everything
your father has a few final words for you
you know hed fight a buzz saw for you he loves you so much
we both do
heck i know that mom
youre my parents
adam sets down his suitcase and goes to his fathers bed
at the door helen dries her eyes with her apron
calvin indicates that he wants to whisper to adam who drops his ear close to his fathers lips
the pipe tobacco
is that all
adam rises and starts for the door
but calvin remembers something and beckons him back to speak weakly into his sons ear
stay out of the adult bookstore
is that all
one more thing
if you find a healthy young woman bring her back with you
and then calvin closes his eyes and sleeps
the soda jerk has turned the rear exit into a religious shrine
hes put flowers and candles and costume jewelry and religious icons from all the majors on top of and around the broken cement
currently hes on his knees rocking back and forth as he prays
there came a rumbling even as from the very bowels of the earth and a great light showed forth followed by gates of armor which opened and shut and delivered
up the vision of a young man whose countenance caused the soda jerk to be struck dumb and to fall on his face and to weep in fear
and adam taking pity on the man put down his suitcase and went to him saying are you all right
yes oh yes
but where is the one who came last night all in yellow
all in yellow
that was my father
can you forgive me for my wasted life
everything has been so awful
comforting him i know it has been terrible
but it wasnt your fault
and now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better
ive got to go now
of course you do
ill stay here and pray
picking up his suitcase thats always a good idea
would you like some money
i have a great deal of it
i dont need money anymore i see that now
how do i leave here
the front door is open
will you be back
adam turns and leaves
the soda jerk falls to his knees and shakes all over
adam steps out onto the sidewalk and sunlight falls on him much brighter than anything he has ever seen
he looks at it on the arm of his coat and then slowly he looks up at the sky
and now it is adam who is dumbstruck
bystander appears and sees adam looking up
what is it
pointing up there
i dont see anything
adam becomes momentarily interested in a parking meter
a mother and her child approach from the other direction
what is it
pointing he sees something
i see it mommy
several more people are drawn over
a convertible goes by in the foreground with passengers who are looking up
what is it
i have never in my life seen anything like this
nothing even comes close
adam continues down the sidewalk looking up
a black woman postal worker passes by
whatcha looking at
oh my holy stars
with attitude say what
offering his hand how do you do maam
leary but taking his hand i do alright
the pakistani exits the adult bookstore
what is it
what do you see
when adam looks down to answer the man he sees the adult bookstore sign
run for your life its invisible poisonous gas
and everyone does run away including adam
the avenue is left totally deserted
helen sits sipping tea deep in thoughts of concern for adam
behind her calvin appears in the open window
you know helen is so startled she knocks the tea all over the place
calvin contd i just wanted to say that i think hes going to be just fine
holding her heart thank you calvin
thank you very much
calvin leaves then comes back
yes dear i know
bus comes directly at camera
slamming down the brake pedal
the braking bus stops an inch from his nose
have him head for bus door in this angle
from over adam
he is in shock
start on a moving steady cam shot on adams pov of bus passengers as he heads for a seat
the passengers look at him in amazement and some fear
going to his seat smiling at the passengers
he is carrying a bill
adam finds a seat next to a heavily perspiring young adam shows the psycho the bill
i tried to give the driver this but he wouldnt take it
he seems angry
a lot of people do
the bus pulls out
it gets up to about twenty miles an hour
adam contd oh boy
here we go
looking back at adam with concern
so this is public transportation
my dad says that it becomes more and more important because of pollution which is more and more carbon dioxide and other hazardous gases in the air
then confidentially do you have a gun by the way
the increasingly nervous psycho looks around then nods that he does
adam contd well thanks for not waving it around
and for not vomitting for that matter
wow were really flying
say do you know where i could find a grocery store
the psycho shakes his head
adam contd i have to find that
and a hardware store and a liquour store and a standing holiday inn
although i may not need the holiday inn
thats still kind of up in the air
it depends really on how things go
pointing theres a grocery store coming up
jumping up driver
please stop the bus immediately
i have to get off
then an aside to the psycho do you think i should get a gun
i dont know
back to driver driver
please stop sir
hes not going to stop until he wants to stop
who are anxious for adam to leave
for the love of god
let him off the bus
cant you see hes meshugina
adam leans in close to the old man
im sorry what did you call me
the man and his wife take that the wrong way and start to scream
hitting the brakes
through the windows we see adam go down
the back door opens as adam gets up
thank you driver
good bye everyone
adam exits the bus
everyone including the psycho heaves a huge sign of relief
adam enters and after getting over the automatic doors and the check out technology is overwhelmed by the magnificence of the postmodern california supermarket
the check out counters alone are amazing
seeing others do it he takes a cart placing his suitcase in it
adam passes the baked goods paying particular attention to the elaborate birthday cakes
is that a birthday cake
yes it is
gee ma nee
the clerk turns to a fellow worker
adam marvels at the abundance and variety
he passes a mother whose child is riding in the cart and that reminds him of his own mom when she used to let him ride that way
then he is surprised to see a middle aged couple so casually dressed in public
she overweight is in an unfortunate terrycloth halter shorts combination
he hirsute is in a sleeveless undershirt and baggy bathing trunks
to himself my first mutants
adam picks up one of those huge california cucumbers that always amaze easterners
he shows it to the japanese is this because of the radiation
adam is looking at the live lobsters as a butcher steps up
consulting his moms list im looking for all beef patties
fresh or frozen
adam chuckles because he thinks the man is kidding
how much are they
frozen theyre six thirty a dozen in the three pound box
then ill need twelve into nine hundred seventy five boxes
and thats almost
five hundred dollars just for the hamburger
and my mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything
the yacht batteries
the diesel oil
the birthday candles
you could have a meat order that big delivered to your home
well thats great then
it just occurred to me
i dont know where i live
i dont know where home is
then would you excuse me
adam hurries away
of adam on another bus
he looks frantically out the window
we see his pov of shops and stores and people
at one point he sees two women joggers which he wonders about
then he sees two men arguing violently
gradually late day turns to night and adam becomes more and more depressed
then he sees something
he is elated
he jumps up and tells the driver driver
stop this bus immediately
the bus stops mid block and adam gets off
he crosses the street causing only one car to hit the brakes
on the other side of the avenue we see what has gotten his attention
its an adult bookstore much like the last one we saw probably owned by the same chain
hes happy but when he looks next door he sees hes in a different place
sad and lost he turns north and starts to walk until a billboard catches his attention
we pan up to see a billboard for liposuction that features an almost nude woman
adam is struck by the image and we spend some time cutting between him and it
then gathering himself he turns and begins to walk south
of him as he passes a body piercing store and wonders about that
then he sees something that blows his mind
of a stray dog passing by
oh my goodness gracious
that is so great
a sign says comic books baseball cards bought sold adam enters with his suitcase in one hand and his cigar box in the other
he steps up to the counter where the owner jerry sits reading the newspaper
he has a fondness for navajo jewelry
gives him a look then goes back to reading hi
a young woman enters from the back of the store and goes to another counter
neither man notices
the name is adam webber and i see you buy baseball cards and although these are a lot older than the ones in the window i was hoping you still
might be interested
he flips open the cigar box to reveal to jerry riches beyond his wildest dreams
jerry actually moans and then must pretend the moan was a cough
how how much do you want for the mickey mantle rookie season
i was thinking of selling all the cards
he reaches in and looks through the cards
see my problem is all i have are hundred dollar bills and i need something smaller
ones fives tens
i see what ya mean
tell you what
ill give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box
oh that would be wonderful
well were here to help
a woman steps into the shot
she has come from the back of the store and her back is momentarily to us
adam turns to her and is immediately awe struck
we reveal eve rustokov
she tosses her lipstick into her purse
eve works in the card shop and is on her way out
im workin here evey poo
dont screw me up
bon soir mademoiselle
are you french
then thinking fast im from out of town
then sensing the need for further clarification im here on business
well your business must not be sports memorabilia because this one mantle card right here holds up a card is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self
get out of here
no you get out of here
she closes his cigar box and gives it to him
you know that
no ferry excuse me jerry i quit
she walks back to the counter to get her coat
i fired ya
just like the hair salon guy and the chevy dealer
you know why you cant keep a goddamn job
because you cant keep your goddamn mouth shut
jerry is surprised when adam suddenly takes his arm firmly
i would really appreciate it if you wouldnt take the lords name in vain again
looking at adams hand oh you got a problem with that
i have a big problem with that
eve sees a fist fight coming
she takes adam by the arm
come on heathcliff ill walk you to the corner
but my name is adam
just come on
they head for the door and exit
adam and eve
the perfect match
i hope you two will be very happy together
mazel fuckin tov
dont try coming back ms
im serious this time
youre finished in the hobby business
take that to the bank why dontcha
adam re enters
i didnt want to leave without saying how much i admire your jewelry
hey smart ass how bout i kick your butt
adam walks towards the man smiling
how bout you what
jerry takes a nervous step backwards but eve steps back in and pulls adam out
i said come on
jerry doesnt know what to say
they exit the store
where are we going
im going home
and judging by that coat id say you have to get back to the barber college
no im lost
did you just lose your job because of me
im sick of working for that dickhead
a walking penis capable of intelligent speech
a mental picture of that causes adam to slump against a store window and drop his box of cards
whats wrong with you
i just had a mental picture of
here pick these up
together they pick up the cards
eve contd where are you parked
i came on a bus
why doesnt that surprise me
i dont know
why doesnt it
well i guess because im a little psychic
i have this thing
oh thats nice
let me guess something
this is your first visit to la la land
youre staying somewhere over in hollywood because like an idiot you thought that would be an exciting place to stay
right so far
could be a question could be an answer
yes im right
i knew it
so anyhow you get on a bus and before you know it youre out here in the san fernando valley without a clue
which brings us to here
where are you staying
the holiday inn
the holiday inn
thats exactly right
not completely but pretty much
that was pretty good wasnt it
it was amazing
anyhow let me predict a bus for you to get on
do you own a car
im not taking you there sweetie
rule number one in north america no strangers in the car
if it will make you feel any better i dont have a gun
well that changes everything
get the fuck away from me
i mean it
she races around the corner
he goes after her
i said something wrong didnt i
please forgive me
get away from me
she runs into a parking lot
ill make a deal with you
ill give you a rogers hornsby if youll take me to the hotel
hes all yours
i was holding him back
adam takes a hornsby card from his coat pocket and shows it to her
rogers hornsbys worth like four thousand dollars
ive got two of him
removing more cards from his pocket and this many dimaggios and robinsons
i was holding these out too
she arrives at her car dirty geo and anxiously unlocks the drivers door
so for four thousand dollars all i have to do is drive you to your hotel
and thats it
i dont have to take a physical in your space ship
what the hell
you got a deal
she gets in
he gets in the back seat behind her
eve contd the front seat
he runs around to the front while eve chats with herself
eve contd why am i doing this
what in the hell is wrong with me
thats what id like to know
traffic is moving at fifteen miles an hour
the dash lights fascinate him but the car scares him
she notices that he is gripping the seat belt for dear life
mister andretti your first time on the freeway
mind if i change the station
better traffic reports on am
she switches over to am and runs by a perry como record round and round looking for traffic
what is it
you had him
take it easy
she gets perry
star struck oh i could die
listen to this part
this is where it really takes off
you are one scary son of a gun
eves car splits for the exit ramp
the sudden speed scares adam
hey what are you doing
i know a short cut
she comes off catches the light and whips onto the surface street tires squealing
adam is hanging onto his seat belt
eve puts the pedal to the metal
you better slow down
i cant help it
perry como always does this to me
i just get so cranked
she turns perry way up
eve does a dandy job of trading lanes and passing
the little geos engine screams
adams sort of getting into it
the geo flies up to a quick stop
eve turns to adam who has had a life experience
end of service
he hands over the card like someone in a post sex stupor
ive never felt anything like that in my life
yeah same here
dont forget your suitcase
he gets out with the suitcase and after shutting the door leans down to speak to her
you know she tears off leaving him there
adam addresses the clerk
i want to stay at this hotel
fill this out please
and ill need a card
adam gives him a baseball card
a bellboy ushers adam in and sets down his bag
bathrooms there tvs over there
remotes on top
room service menu is on the table
adam picks up the phone and listens
you dial nine to get out
beat then of what
beat then the hotel
beat then he hangs up i see
well thank you very much
youve been very very nice
he offers two dollars
adam contd i was able to get some change downstairs and my father taught me that its customary to tip in a situation such as this
your father is a smart guy
my father is a genius
dont let the bedbugs bite
thats what my mom always says
choking up who im really beginning to miss
its my first night away from home
how old are you
you dont look thirty five
how old do i look
i guess living up here makes people look older
up here on the fifteenth floor
catching himself yes
up here on the fifteenth floor
adam abruptly shuts the door in the mans face
he goes to the window and looks out
the height scares him to death
he jumps back
adams parents pray
and lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son adam
she begins to tear up and he pats her hand
adam sits by the window watching his first dawn
its another bright smoggy day
and here comes eve marching from the parking garage to the hotel entrance
skyward what in the hell am i doing here
thats what id like to know
somebody tell me that
eve is speaking to a desk clerk
you dont have a last name
all i know is that his first name is adam
he is seated on the bed transfixed watching a television commercial
the phone rings loudly
adam nearly jumps out of his skin
after he figures out where the ringing is coming from he answers the phone
into phone after a long pause yes
at the house phone
into phone hi
this is the woman from the baseball card store
boy is he glad to hear from her
hot diggity dog
thank you for calling me on the telephone
eve holds the receiver away from her for a moment
hey listen im in the lobby
pause then on the first floor
where the hell else would it be
the doors open and adam hurries out looking for eve who he sees and goes directly to smiling all the while like a rumpled idiot
i am so glad to see you
i thought id never see you again
okay down boy
holds up the baseball card i cant take this for driving you home
i wish i could but i cant
so here take it back
i could have just left it for you at the desk but its very valuable
now take it
i cant its yours
with hand over his mouth okay
he takes the card
why are you doing that
i havent brushed yet
well so long
enjoy your visit
she heads for the front door
he goes after her
wait eve please
please dont follow me
dont do it
i knew this would happen
youre like a lost puppy
cant you please just talk to me for one second
she stops he stops
i should have taken the money and run
thats what troy told me to do
but do i listen
put your hand down
is he your husband
or a boyfriend
eyes to heaven thank q
oh stop that
listen i know you like me
i can tell
but you know what
a lot of guys like me
not me exactly
its more like the legs or the butt or the hair
or some combination of the above
i think its the eyes
an eye man
anyhow it never works out
not that you even need to know that
you look like crap by the way
what have you been doing
watching television in color
hey no kidding
cross my heart and hope to die
she looks at him for a beat or two then abruptly turns away
why doesnt it never work out
why does it never work out
who the hell knows
he follows closely
eve contd okay if you promise to leave me alone ill tell you
it never works out because im into legs and butts and hair myself
so i wind up with guys who are very good looking but even more shallow than i am if you can picture that
now if youll excuse me i have to go find another low paying demeaning job where some guy named jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is
why not go to work for me
selling all my baseball cards
and helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks
food and supplies
like starving people
well theyre not starving yet but they need help
how long would you need me
whats the pay
ive got to make at least a thousand a week
he gives her his patented thumbs up sign which of course is exactly like his fathers
you got it
wait here while i change
he walks back to the hotel
to herself my careers finally taking off
heavy duty boat batteries are being loaded into a u haul truck
the store manager steps up to eve who is watching
adam appears in the bg thanking and being nice to the men loading the truck
he looks mighty stupid in another one of his dads old outfits
why would someone need twenty yacht batteries
i just work for the guy
and who does he work for
its some sort of charity thing
i guess for starving people with yachts
eve and adam shop with two carts both full of cases of why not buy them milk or something instead of dr
they like dr
who are these people
my mom and dad
very funny smart ass
im going to need all of this
this is swell
he goes over to a huge supply of prince albert
to herself swell
eve and adam watch as a man with a forklift puts a years supply of toilet paper into the back of the rental truck
a crowd has gathered to watch adam and eve empty seven shopping carts full of non perishable groceries
eve goes to get into the truck
adam hurries by her
he opens the door for her
she shakes her head and gets in
she drives the truck to a stop
he keeps the beat to the song on the am radio
adam loves it
eve hates it
they come to a stop and she snaps off the radio
well another day another dollar
then stop staring at me
he gets out
pick you up at eight tomorrow morning
hey you know
i was thinking
she pulls away
adam drags the last pound bag of flour into a self storage locker and pulls down the sliding door which he padlocks
well have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry
its your life
and by the way its a dandy
i guess well need another locker
well just sell another baseball card
you know eve dont get mad okay
but id just be lost without you
i guess you and i uh
dont even think about it
i know that sounds mean but believe me it would be meaner if i didnt say it
now lets take the truck back and get something to eat
she hops in behind the wheel
he hurt is a little slower getting in his side
traffic is moving about forty miles an hour
their truck is in one of the middle lanes
adam screws up his guts and turns to her
theres something else i would like you to help me with
well this is going to sound a little crazy
laughing oh im sure it will
then forget it
what is it
this is for me
think of me as your genie
i would like you to help me find a
because i want to get married
i dont want to be alone
you can be single and not alone
the big one
i didnt know that
everybody knows that
ask my divorced sisters
or ask my divorced mom and dad
theyre all divorced
it didnt used to be that way
i wouldnt know
then what kind of wife are you looking for
one whos not a mutant
no dogs huh
and if possible id like to marry someone from pasadena
she is speechless
then when do you need her by
well i could probably get you laid in two weeks but to locate a non mutant wife from pasadena
that could take some time
thats what i was afraid of
adam and eve are in a booth
the waitress approaches with sandwiches and drinks
what do you mean you can get me laid
he and the waitress look to eve for an answer
could we talk about that a little later
sugary to waitress thank you
the amazed waitress leaves
adam automatically lowers his head and says grace
two happenin guys at the counter look over and chuckle at the rube
eve flips them a mean bird and mouths the words fuck you as adam continues to pray
the guys shut up
eve shares a frame santa monica bungalow
its in a pretty nice neighborhood on a quiet street
her geo fishtails into the picture and comes to rest half in the street half on the curb
adam is driving
the engine is still running
she rips the keys out of the ignition
now get out
stop that maam crap
they get out
you almost got us killed
i told you ive never driven before
never drive again
you said it would be easy
i was wrong
is this your house
i like it
she storms off for the house where a young man is coming out the front door in a cut off t shirt and spandex exercise shorts
cliff is leaving with a cardboard box full of clothes
he is exceedingly good looking and in very good shape
eve and adam come up the steps
what are you bitching about now
what are you doing here
i forgot some of my stuff
let me see that
she looks in the box
holds up a pair of old briefs
you came back for these
hey theyre ralph laurens
and whos this interesting looking fellow
this is adam
adam meet cliff
offering hand how do you do
i do fine adam
how bout yourself
eyeing eve you doin any good
go home cliff wherever that might be
shana gillroys apartment
the model who went to harvard
well i better get going
cliff smiles and bounces down the steps
why thank you
very nice to have met you cliff
then to her may i ask you a question
hes a former boyfriend
we lived together for about six months
and yes ill admit it
ive still kind of got a thing for him
entering the house thats what you wanted to know isnt it
following actually no
i was wondering why cliff likes to wear another mans underpants
very good music is playing
adam listens to one speaker then crosses to listen to the other
then he goes back to the first
eve is pouring champagne into a glass that contains two sugar cubes
next she adds several dashes of bitters
troy her gay roommate throws together a tray of appetizers as dinner cooks on the stove
this guy is un be liev able
i knew youd like him
darlin this is x file stuff
think about it
the guys got all this easily negotiable property
hes obviously setting something up very big
like a self sustaining island off the coast of south america for instance
or perhaps hes the head of a cult thats doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco
ive heard worse
he rushes out with the tray
troy enters with sushi appetizers
adam is looking at the ceiling
you have very nice ceilings
well thank you
you like ceilings
well i hope you like these
fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed
or nori if you prefer
i love sushi
i love lucy
eve enters with adams drink and two white wines
here you go
one champagne cocktail
i thought only hookers drank those things
well i know mom sure likes em
eve and troy look at each other as she hands him his wine
dinner in fifteen minutes
why dont we sit and chat
where on earth are you from
out of town
thats all hell say
its a very small place
people dont even know its there
and its called
maybe eve can guess
defensive since that guy rear ended me in palm springs
i even guessed his hotel didnt i
right on the button
well dionne warwick guess his home town
give me your hand
to himself oh my god
adam holds out his hand and she takes it rubbing her finger slowly and gently around in his palm
for her its psychic stuff
for him its spine tingling
okay lets see
im not promising anything
lots of snow
way up north
are we getting hot
you live in
the only way in or out of your place is by plane and
youve definitely come down here for food and supplies and
to find a wife
she tosses back his hand and grabs her wine for a victory gulp
to eve ive never met anyone like you in my life
hey butthead im clairvoyant
ive got goose bumps all over me
why not just go to
nome for supplies and a wife
isnt that closer
thats where youd go to find girls
hes gay by the way
good for you
well we try
listen let me just ask you a few questions
when did alaska become a state
who use to own it
when did we get it from them
million dollars for it
a tidy sum then as well as now
im quoting my father of course
whats the capitol
sorry thats the largest city
troy jumps up and runs out of the room
wheres he gone
hes gone to check your answers on his computer
he has a computer
in the house
we keep it in the backyard
of course in the house
its in there
may i please be excused
he has alaska on his computer screen
adam enters and looks at the computer which captivates him
this must be very new
its so small
what are you talking about
this is the new mac
you a hacker
i dont think so
you dont have a computer in your cabin
how do you get through those winters
reading screen well youre right
then covering the screen with his hand whats the highest peak
its also the highest point in north america
after peeking at the screen okay maybe she is psychic
lets go eat
indicating computer that would knock my father out
to himself it would probably kill him
hes a windows guy then huh
he likes windows
well i think windows stink
what do you think of that
i guess its
just a matter of personal taste
editorial scenes and should follow scene rather than precede it
calvin webber is sleeping soundly
helen stands quietly at the door looking at him
she finishes off her champagne cocktail and very quietly shuts the door
helen goes into the elevator
obviously shes had too much to drink
the floor rumbles and the metal doors open emitting the red light
soda jerk and ten of his followers stand up expectantly and anxiously
helen appears and looks at this terribly odd assortment of people
who are you
beat then im the mother
its the mother
and they all fall down on their knees and worship her with much wailing and rejoicing
several speak in tongues
helen stares at them wide eyed presses the button on the control box and goes back down
adams impeccable table manners serve to highlight eves and troys utter lack of same
but first you have to start with the clothes
then to adam you understand that dont you
you have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that
to troy so what are you seeing
looking adam over i dont know
money is no object
hes got cards up the wazoo
try to listen
then to troy whataya think
surfer grunge hip hop euro trash
youre serious arent you
whats that supposed to mean
it means that your taste in mens apparel is as bad as your taste in men
well thats blunt
but if the shoe fits
and i suppose you see him in some sort of strapless thing dont you
i see elegant
like ralph lauren
thats what im sensing
the guy with the underpants
indicating adam not on him
im not wearing his pants
he has great pants
i just dont want to
why dont you take him and pick out his clothes
alright i will
talking with her mouth full im busy tomorrow anyway
i have to buy six thousand paper napkins
what do you think adam
whatever you two want
if youve got the time ive got the wazoo
eve and troy watch him eat for a beat or two
isnt it a little tiring to sit up straight like that
what about holding your right arm up like that all the time
just give it a try
and for gosh sake eve take your foot off the chair
eve and troy emulate adam
troy and adam get out of eves car with a lot of packages
they head for the house
i guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new
almost all of them
the recovery is very impressive
hey they rebuilt the freeway in six months
im very impressed
eve is on the couch doing her toenails when adam and troy enter
adam is in a casually elegant outfit that looks terrific
both he and troy are carrying lots of other packages and garment bags
we see names like gucci armani and lauren
eve is visibly impressed by adams makeover
well what do you think
let me show you the entire trousseau
but first let me show her these
he reaches into a bag and removes a box that contains a pair of rollerblades
adam contd eve can i skate around your block
making it sexual how bout it eve
can he skate around your block
beat then no
there is a most unusual band shell location on the beach that is completely covered by graffiti
eve and troy sit at one of the many stone tables watching adam skate all over the place
he wears spandex workout pants and a t shirt
the starting crane shot begins on the nearly deserted commercial section of venice beach and then takes us to the band shell
of him skating and them watching
hes going to kill himself
then to adam go skate out on the bike path
its that way
he heads out of the band shell
we follow him as he skates into an area that has been given over to the homeless
they sit around in their sleeping bags and blankets and cheer and jeer adam when he passes by
he takes them to be more mutants
adam skates to it and is amazed to see two very pretty girls skating in their tiny bikinis
a nearly nude body builder guy goes by on a bike
then adam sees the ocean
breaking on the beach and rocks
adam tosses off his roller blades and walks trance like towards the waves
appear on a dune behind him and watch
adam raises his arms to greet the ocean perhaps like a plains indian would
then he joyously runs into the surf and dives
that waters freezing
hes from alaska
he surfaces and throws his fists in the air
thats why little things mean so much to him
begin the record ymca over this
eve enters from her morning shower to find troy and adam goofing to the village people song
she gives troy a disapproving look
he wanted to hear some standards
my hip daughters tell me that ymca is enjoying a huge rebirth of popularity at their parties
apparently they line dance to it
a helicopter shot follows the u haul in traffic
adam and eve fill a second storage site
we see the infield of a gay softball team wheel a double play
cheering the play with other gay fans
i get it
i finally get it
you have to see it to understand it
she looks out the back window at the rain and shakes her head
she exits the back door with an umbrella
eve hurries to adam who is sitting on a lawn chair in the middle of the small back yard enjoying the rain
she holds the umbrella over her head
have you ever heard the saying he hasnt got enough sense to come in out of the rain
then watching the rain hit the palm of his hand you know my father who is a scientist says that everything is a miracle
until recently i wasn t sure what he meant by that
listen you still want to go girl hunting tonight
i certainly do
but you know this business of finding you a wife its kind of ridiculous dont you think
rising no its not
yes it is
a girlfriend maybe
but a wife
then just help me find a girlfriend
thats all i ask
ill give you every single card ive got left
hey screw you
you think im just somebody you can buy off
listen let me tell you something taking her by the arms would you do it just because youre my friend
my very best friend
he hugs her
thank q eve
shes uncomfortable with the hug
wait a minute
no shes not
this hip up market club is based on a s theme
establish the youthful rich arriving in their black four wheel vehicles and silver porsches
coats and ties
eve troy and adam arrive on foot
adam notices the valet parking
why did you park way back there
miss rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car
eve looks like she owns the place
as they enter adam grabs troy who is leading the way
ladies first troy
that was close
adam and troy follow eve in
the club is noisy and hopping
the house music is from the s
adam eve and troy enter a long corridor of booths and walk forward
adams got on that terrific dark suit
eve notices them noticing
my goodness gracious
this place is something
adam gives it a shot and goes too bored
he gets vaguely bored but misses unimpressed by a mile
unimpressed but still interested
he tries that
its like watching a neon sign switch back and forth first interested then not
do i look crazy
he overplays that
just be yourself
always good advice
it doesnt work for the rest of us
holy mo ly miss pay o ly
this place is neat o
adam enters the main room
eve and troy follow
there is a bar a seated section and a dance floor with a dj booth
the dj is in a white dinner jacket and does a perfect humphrey bogart impression as he ad libs his speel between records
jason and jonathan wave when they see eve and troy approaching
they ad lib hellos
here and at the tables the recorded music is so loud they must speak over it
jason jonathan this is adam
adam thats them
how do you do
its very nice to meet you jason and jonathan
confidentially to them my mother always told me that if you meet a person for the first time its easier to remember their names if you use those names right
jason and jonathan just stare at him
hes from alaska
a slightly drunk beauty named sophie appears behind eve
hi there eve whos the hunk
eve hates sophie
get lost sophie
sophie pushes her way right up to adam
hello sophie im adam webber
adam lives in alaska
tu parle francais
tu a un tres bon accent
you speak beautiful french
jai habite a paris un an
la ville de lumieres
cest bien rencontrer quelquun pour pratiquer le francais
si tu veux nous pouvons pratiquer beaucoup des choses ensemble
eve steps in and takes adams hand drawing him away from sophie
quit showing off
were here on business
eve leads adam to a table
i thought i was here to meet women
not that one
i like her
and dont be so obvious
adam eve and troy examine female patrons over drinks
its white wine for her imported beer for troy and a rob roy for adam
what have you ordered
its a rob roy
a very popular drink im told
what about her
i think shes very attractive
shes got bitch written all over her
you do know what bitch means dont you
yes i have a dictionary
but i cant understand for the life of me why you would call her that
or why cliff would say that about you
because were bitches
look at her
look at the expression on her face
the walk the jewelry the fingernails
how bout this one
this one is a killer blond
are you kidding
you wouldnt even be a crumb on her table
you dont see that
well im trying to educate him
its nothing personal
adam i think for you we should go for sweet
i like that
swigging her drink yeah sweet
thats a nice way of putting it
to troy what do i say to miss sweet when i meet her
its not so much what you say but how you say it
women like men who are unpredictable
basically they want what they think they cant have
same with guys
thats why everybody is walking around here sending off you cant have me signals
doing precisely that
then thats ridiculous
but thats how it works
theres miss sweet
at the hors doeuvres table
shes a pretty young thing with a sweet face
go say hello romeo
looks like a healthy non mutant to me
very serious okay
then and what do i say
say something surprising
lie if need be
lying is always a very effective dating tool
thank you my friends
adam contd by the way thats a great play
romeo and juliet
i cried at the end
adam nods and shoves off
im not sure i want to watch this
eve puts her hand to her head hating herself and still not sure exactly why
crossing to miss sweet
to himself surprising and funny
well i know a duck who bought some lip balm
adam sheepishly approaches miss sweet then gathers himself hi
not sweet yes
beat then i was wondering if you might help me
i seem to have lost my congressional medal of honor somewhere around here
miss sweet stares at him for a beat or two then chuckles
oh now thats a great one
big smile you like it
a little clap bravo
they both laugh
as they watch adam and miss sweet
another pretty young woman heather joins adam
heather is a friend of miss sweets
this is my new friend
im adam webber
hes really funny
i dont believe ive ever heard that name before
theres a slight beat before both girls laugh
i told you
eve finds that she very much hates watching adam having a good time with other healthy non mutants
we work on rodeo drive
but were both professional dancers
i took a dance lesson everyday of my life until a couple of days ago
no im not
my mom taught me
your mom was a dancer
she is a dancer
and a lovely one
you would like her very much
shall we dance
they head for the dance floor
a jitterbug song comes on and so does adam
he and miss sweet are a little rough on take off but they hit smooth sailing soon enough
hes terrific at picking up the new stuff she shows him
they are shocked
heather cuts in on miss sweet as the other dancers stop to watch someone who is so much better than them
the three of them begin to dance together
you know hes a very very good shut up
adam dances beautifully with the two women
we cut back and forth between them and eve
adam miss sweet and heather complete their dance with great aplomb
other dancers applaud them
someone is whistling loudly off camera
adam and his dance partners look over to she is whistling like a guy calling his dog
troy is embarrassed
eve points at adam and beckons broadly for him to come over a basketball coach calling her player off the floor
what in the hell is wrong with you
is that your girl friend
would you please excuse me
if youll please come back
i will certainly try
and thank you both very much for the dance
when was the last time you saw manners like that
its like meeting a foreigner or something
as adam comes over
the music is not so loud now
to troy go to the bathroom
then off her look well youre being so bossy i wasnt sure
troy rises and exits
adam arrives and sits down
you wanted to see me
youre not from alaska
whered you learn to dance like that
and there are no starving people are there
why are you suddenly so mad at me
dont change the subject
i want you to tell me the truth about yourself
ive never lied to you
ive maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe but ive never lied
you think im some sort of sap
i admire you
i fell in love with you the first time i saw you
off her look i did
i think that you are the most i want to know exactly who you are and what youre really up to
let me tell you the whole thing
in well well well
dont we clean up nice
cliff steps up to the table
adam automatically a gentleman rises and offers his hand
hello cliff how are you this evening
cliff barely shakes his hand
then he sits in adams seat
but i do miss that green sport coat of yours
thank you very much
but cliff thats my seat
and i was just to eve how bout a drink at the bar
pause then sure
cliff gestures to the chair
its all yours
eve and cliff go to the bar
adam sits down glumly
he looks across the room and catches the eye of miss sweet who is seated at a table with heather
a good looking guy is hitting on them
cutting back and forth between adam and them we see miss sweets smile escalate
then she nudges heather who also looks over and smiles
adam smiles back
finish with a closer shot of his pov of miss sweets hair butt and legs
eve and cliff are in cozy conversation at the bar
jonathan jason and sophie are in the bg
angle troy returning from the restroom
he is surprised to see eve at the bar with cliff
when he looks back at the dance floor table adam is not there
so where is your roommate the model
you know i dont know
and looking at you i dont care
its been too long eve
please excuse this interruption
adam steps closer looking past cliff at eve
eve i dont mean to be rude and please excuse me cliff but eve isnt cliff just a butt with hair
im sorry and legs
legs butt and hair
well isnt he
and shallow as well
the shallowest guy in the world shallow
go home adam
go to your hotel
before i kick your ass
he gives adam a shove
cliff i must warn you
i know how to defend myself
cliff throws a right which adam calmly blocks and counters with a short right jab to cliffs mouth snapping his head back
its not a big punch but very very quick
it makes eve mad and astonishes troy jason and jonathan
stop it you two
slightly insecure i guess we shouldnt fight in here
lowering his guard yes i agree
cliff draws back another right
adam flicks out a quick left to cliffs cheek again snapping his head back but not his body
these arent big movie hits
cliff takes a beat or two then draws back his right fist again
adam pops him in the nose
cliff drops his right arm to his side
increasingly insecure maybe we shouldnt fight at all
fighting is pretty immature
lowering his guard it certainly is
i agree with you completely
i dont blame you
turning to eve eve im sorry
seeing an opportunity cliff rears back with another right
adam deftly pops him in the mouth again with a short right jab
deeply insecure well good night everyone
troy jonathan and jason say good night to him
cliff walks unsteadily away bleeding from the mouth and both nostrils
hopeful that no one has noticed that hes very subtly just gotten the crap beat out of him
im leaving too
but eve i would and tomorrow maybe troy will help you out because i quit
this is ridiculous
adam looks over at troy who shrugs
troy takes out his keys as he approaches the front door
but the door opens
eve stands there in sweats
he go back to the hotel
he might of
she slams the door
whats that mean
we did not leave together
who did he leave with
whats it to you
im his pimp
he left with the dancers didnt he
hey youre the psychic
eve the psychic pimp
you tell me
but whos not a slut these days
he enters the kitchen she follows him he gets something to drink
where are you going
im not the one whos in love with the guy
now hold on
wait one damn minute
troy exits into his office
he plops down on the chair
in the first place i dont fall in love with weirdos ive only known for four or five days
yes you do
and i dont fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards
uh yes you do
or pee in their pants when they see the ocean
yes you do
or have perfect table manners
sitting up you know i asked him about that
and he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them
see youd eat like a slob if you were alone but since another human being is present you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper
i didnt know that
i thought it was a way of appearing superior
then know what else he told me
sitting on the bed what
he thinks that i am a gentleman and that you are a lady
well consider the source
i dont even know what a lady is
i thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses
turns out the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable
if you dont do that nothing else matters
the cars the clothes the houses
where did he get all that information
from the oddest place
his parents told him
i dont think i got that memo
so now i suppose hes trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible
he didnt leave with them
i admit it
im glad to hear that
he left with sophie
she swept him out the door whispering little french things into his ear
please dont tell me that
what are you going to do
go over to her place and kick in the door
youre goddamn right i am
she exits then sticks her hand back in
eve contd you coming
cringing i dont think so
gentleman coward to you
eve hurries out of the house leaving the front door wide open
she runs down the porch steps across the yard and to her car which she unlocks with the usual fumbling
come on damn it
she jumps in and sticks the key in the ignition
adam appears at the passenger window
eve screams bloody murder as she throws open her door and jumps out into the street where she falls down hurting her knee
adam runs around the car to help her to her feet
dogs start barking in several houses
scare me why dont you
you stupid son of a bitch
im really sorry
what in the hell are you doing here
youre supposed to be over on san vicente boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut sophie
and im really sorry
well you should be
thanks to you my heart is in my neck
eve marches with a limp back to the house
eve if youll let me i can look
how attractive is that
what if this is for life
i know first aid
well you had better
he chases her up the porch steps
lights are low and warm
adam is attempting to swab the abrasion on eves knee through the tear in her old sweat pants
wait a minute
she reaches down and gives the knee hole a good rip revealing her leg from above the knee to the gym sock
he takes the back of her calf in one hand and applies the antiseptic to her knee with the other
it stings and she flinches
its going to be all right in no time
he leans down and blows on the wound
cu of that
cu of his hand on her calf
cu of her looking down at him watching as he blows gently on her knee
i went to sophies and she was very hospitable
is that what you call it
but it just wasnt where i wanted to be so i left as politely as i could and found a taxi
but i asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel
theres a song mister como sings called on the street where you live
you know it
sing it to me
softly saying it as much as singing it all at once am i several stories high knowing im on the street where you live
its about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves
she reaches down and taking hold of his collar draws him to her and they kiss very romantically and at length
dumb question but humor me
have you ever had sex before
she sits up
how is that possible
during the following speech camera pushes past him and lingers on her as she gradually realizes that adam is mental
sitting up in when the bomb was dropped on los angeles my parents were in our fallout shelter
thats where i was born
we only survived because it was a huge shelter as fallout shelters go
my father worked on it secretly for years
when he had to he used contractors but always from out of state and always for just a portion of the job
he told them it was a secret government experiment done through caltech
my dads not a liar but he felt in this case he had no choice
of course it had to be a secret because we had just enough supplies to last three people thirty five years
thats also why i have no brothers or sisters
the air vent was the really tricky part but he was able to cut into a flood control sewer
what id like to do eve is take you down into the fallout shelter with me
we could live there with my mom and dad
my dad said if i found a healthy girl i should bring her on down
and you look plenty healthy to me
i want you to go back to the hotel now
ill call you a cab
i shouldnt be over here at this hour
she gets up and leads him to the door
and ill see you in the morning in the lobby
do you mind waiting outside for the taxi
not at all
and eve thank you for tonight
and for the kiss
it was at least as good as the sky
and i think better than the ocean
adam comes out glowing with happiness
he looks heavenward
and does his patented thumbs up
behind him we hear eve locking all the locks on her front door
a refrigerated u haul truck lurches down the street
adam struggles with the gears as troy worries about his driving skills
wait a minute
he promptly pulls over and turns off the engine
i took the lords name in vain again didnt i
im so sorry
theres an adult bookstore back there
ill be right back
adam jumps out of the truck and runs off
without question the strangest man ive ever met
adam runs up
the bookstore looks familiar
adam runs to the next store
its a bar
he runs to the next store
its the malt shop
adam is thrilled
he tries the front door and at first it does not open
the soda jerk is leading about twelve followers in prayers
give us a sign
thats all we ask
give us some sort of sign
the front door opens and adam peers in
he sees the soda jerk smiles broadly at him and waves
then he closes the door
the soda jerk grabs his heart and faints
his followers rush to his aid
adam jumps in
lets get those all beef frozen patties
how bout we check with eve first
so did you buy a movie
a toy perhaps
in the bookstore
concentrating on his driving no i wouldnt go in one of those places with a gas mask on
laughing in agreement i know what you mean
i usually wear a big hat and dark glasses
does that work
adam would not have thought that
adam springs in troy drags in behind him knowing the deal
eve is standing away from the door next to a kind looking professional woman named dr
this is uh
im nina aron adam
how do you do
very well thank you
im with the county family services department
eve tells me youve been living in a bomb shelter most of your life
theres a difference
adam id like to introduce you to my associate mr
brown appears from the kitchen
hes good sized man who dresses casually
adam becomes uneasy
he nods politely
we want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences
for how long
well that depends
i thank you very much for the invitation but im quite busy today
perhaps i could see you tomorrow
you should go with dr
its the best thing
the best thing for you
all right eve
if you say so
to aron could i please just go home
i was lost but this morning i found home and i promise not to bother any of you ever again
lets go talk first adam
the two come forward
one opens the door and one beckons for adam to step out
good bye adam
adam looks back at eve who looks away
to eve youll be hearing from me
she shuts the door
troy sits dejectedly
well what was i supposed to do
he wants me to live underground with him
thats like silence of the lambs dont you think
you did the right thing
eve goes to the window and watches as we see adam break from brown and run off with him chasing
she runs out
adam races down the sidewalk
he cuts left and runs between houses
brown is not as fast
eve and troy run out to aron who is dialing her cell phone
oh my god
hell catch him
then into phone hi
this is nina aron
ive got a run away and im going to need police assistance
not the police
dont call them
i have to
if a complaint is made and the person resists obser no i cant have that
theyll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs calm down please
this man needs help and you need protection from him
you know i dont think so
im confused but you know i dont think hed ever hurt me
i dont think hed hurt anyone
and now you must let me be the judge of that
i was frightened and i didnt know what to think
but you know i believe him
i think he just wants to go home
wherever the hell that is
lets all remain calm
thats the key thing
suddenly adam appears from the side of the house startling everyone
he tosses his hotel key to eve
the key to my hotel room
i want you to have my baseball cards
running to the truck and please be sure to pay my bill
young man stop right there
aron looks around for mr
adam jumps into the truck
aron yells for him to stop
stop right now
get out of that truck
adam you really shouldnt try to drive that truck
starting the engine bye troy
and thanks for always being happy
yelling to adam well youre
adam gets the truck in reverse and backs out of the driveway and into a parked car
thats my car you son of a bitch
getting the truck in first adam has to go down the sidewalk a bungalow or two before he can get back onto the street
he clips two parked cars as he does
brown comes running from the side of the house
his pants are torn
aron contd where the hell have you been
i fell down
to troy and eve whats the license number of that truck
dont ask them
theyre as fucked up as the other guy
lets all just try to remain calm
thats the key thing
how bout i just knock the shit out of you
brown has to grab her
eve and troy arrive in her geo to see that the two locker doors are open and much of the stuff has been carried off
eve drops her head in disappointment
i guess he took what he could
putting her head in her hand good god
you dont think there really is a bomb shelter do you
she gives him a look
troy contd theres a difference
helen is using the hip reduction machine while calvin reads how to win friends and influence people
the distant sound of the hatchway being open gets their attention
they jump up and race into the living room meeting adam halfway
the parents kiss and hug their son before noticing that hes got the soda jerk with him
ive got almost everything we need
and this nice man
we met earlier
he promptly drops to his knees in supplication
and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down
but weve got to hurry
are you in trouble son
i think im being chased by a psychiatrist
how bad is it up there
you have something on your forehead
eve and troy look around
she opens a drawer and sees how nicely folded and put away things are
troy notices tv guide and the gideon bible sitting out with a page marker in it
he opens the night table drawer and takes out the cigar box
what do you want to do with it
give it back to him
and if we cant find him
well find him
eve enters and looks at how tidy adams toiletries are how the comb is just right in the brush how the tooth paste ipanna in a tube has been squeezed
from the bottom and at how he has hung up his socks to dry
it makes her very sad
she picks up the toothpaste and holds it as if it were his ring
he enters with stock certificates and sees that shes very close to crying
i dont know
everythings so neat
its all just so
starting to cry damn
found them in the box with the cards
these are stock certificates
instead of taking the certificates she hands him the toothpaste and sits down on the bed in a funk
troy contd looking at the toothpaste ipana
i think i remember that brand
then oh here you should read this
he holds out the tube and she takes it to read
adam the soda jerk and fifteen followers hurriedly unload the truck taking provisions into the back door of the malt shop
their pal jason is on the phone with troy
purchased in and
ten thousand shares of each
theyd be worth millions
hell i dont know
millions upon millions upon millions
how bout that
troy is on the phone
eve is standing looking at the stock certificates
he slams down the phone and jumps to his feet
millions upon millions upon millions
the guy was on the level
and you blew it
a man walks into your life who is the kindest most polite honest trustworthy incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life
and what do you do
have him committed
he was always so nice
how was i supposed to know thats a good thing
nice is weird
what is nice
its not cool
ill tell you that
beat then was it ever
i dont know
i like to think so
well at least i fell for him before i found out he was rich
then wait a minute
he said today he knew where home was
what happened this morning
where did you go
to get some frozen poultry
we came back to the house
you didnt stop anywhere else
no wait a minute
we stopped at a porno store
an adult bookstore
he was very excited about seeing it
you think home is under a dirty bookstore in the valley
she heads out
troy and eve approach and enter
the pakistani looks up briefly when eve and troy enter
there are two male customers in the bg
eve taps her foot on the floor hoping to hear a hollow sound
but it is solid
she and troy move about the store tapping their feet and finally jumping up and down
the pakistani and two customers become concerned
to pakistani have you got a basement
indicating merchandise believe me all the really good stuff is right here
is there a back entrance
are you kidding
he points to the rear of the store
the soda jerk drives the rental truck away leaving the lot empty and the door to the malt shop closed
troy and eve appear after the truck is gone
why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop
none of this stuff was here in
the valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards
well weve come a long way havent we
i want to go home
maybe hell call
they turn left to get back to the avenue
the phone is ringing
then the recorder answers
troy and eve are out so leave a message
and if you want to leave a number dont say it fast
i hate that
say it slow
beep uh eve
this is adam
look i just wanted to thank you for everything you did for me
and i wanted to tell you that i
that i wish so many good things for you
i wish so hard that all of your dreams come true
eve lets troy drive
she clutches the cigar box and rests her head on the seat as they pull away from the curb in front of the bookstore
a low rider passes them on the left
eve sees an old hag being shoved out of the bar and a homeless man slipping into the abandoned malt shop and the cross dressing street walker making eyes at
passing cars and adam hanging up the pay phone he just used
she rolls down her window
turning when he hears eve yell his name
running from the car
the cigar box falls to the street and the contents scatter
eve could care less
besides troy is there to retrieve everything
in a series of cuts and slo mo action the couple race into each others arms
to the pleasure of all the lowlifes mentioned above
now the street looks more like capra than scorsese
shes surprised that she wants to kiss him so bad
hes surprised that he gets so aggressive
helen watches calvin work on the timing device for the locks with a screwdriver
how long will you set it for this time
i thought ten years
considerably shorter than before
i was wondering calvin why set the locks at all
i mean the radiation is gone and
to keep whats up there from getting down here
its not the radiation im worried about
they turn to see adam walking forward with eve
id like for you to meet miss eve rustokov
calvin knows a russian name when he hears one
but he chooses not to pursue it
stepping forward offering her hand how do you do mrs
rather dumb struck hello
ive heard so many wonderful things about you
well please excuse us
we havent entertained a guest in
what can i offer you eve
eve and i have to go
i cant explain it now
but i want you to set the locks for two months
you have more than enough of everything
then well be back to get you
but i dont understand
and im asking you to trust me without understanding why
well in that case
of course son
they are wonderful parents
we have to go
at least stay for dinner
calvin mixes drinks just like he did at the party in
adam is with him
helen races around just like she did in getting the roast ready
adam said i shouldnt mention the communists
please dont mention the communists
helen hurries out of the kitchen to take her seat
the others are already there
i hope im not being nosey but are you and adam
webber we are
then im also from pasadena
helen nearly comes unglued
calvin is pleased too
he raises his tea cup
to adam and eve
the others also raise their cups and everyone clicks
then they drink
gagging what is this sh
most people dont know how good it is heated up
you know they dont do they
they begin to eat
eve contd what about grace
oh my goodness
we almost forgot
then i like your friend adam
they all join hands and lower their heads
calvin leads them
and you thought your parents were weird
adam and eve are with a real estate broker
the broker unlocks the gate of a chain link fence and adam and eve step onto the property
the brokers lexus is in the b
its like the garden of eden dont you think
adam and eve respond but we cant hear them under eves narration
you see that night adam had a choice between me and his parents
adam and eve are working with a team of architects and contractors at the site of a new home
they have plans and are discussing dimensions
its truly amazing what you can get done when you have unlimited funds
did you know you can have whole houses built in just a matter of months
all you have to say is this
i dont care what it costs
and then of course youve got to really mean it which no one ever does
it is under construction
adam eve and troy enter
this is great stuff from the fifties and the sixties
adam finds things very similar to what he grew up with
theres a lamp or something thats just like the lamp or something from the webber living room
that lamp is perfect
very faggy im holding that for elton john
faggy right back oh i think not
adam and eve embracing as troy picks up baseball cards and the street people look on
eve ive got to go back
my parents cant handle this up here
and there was no bomb was there
i cant tell them that
i cant ever let them know
it makes their life
i cant let that happen
we can make this work adam
im very good at making things work
my mothers like that
they kiss again
eve and troy are showing large color drawings to the soda jerk
in cu we see the malt shop exterior all dolled up with a big lighted sign that says give me shelter
theres valet parking and the adult bookstore and bar have been turned into a souvenir center think planet hollywood
another drawing shows fashionable guests boarding the elevator
it took a while to convince archbishop milker that adam wasnt god and he was pretty broken up about it too until i showed him my plans for los angeles
hottest and most original night spot
other drawings show dancing on the shelter patio and guided tours being shown various parts of the shelter
youll be a ten percent partner and still retain ownership of the entrance
praise the lord
and i mean the real one
a cadillac leads a windowless van through automatic gates that have signs on them saying private road and no trespassing
troy drives the van
eve drives the cadillac
adam is her passenger
our idea was to bring adams parents up to the surface very slowly
make them very comfortable and then break the bad news to them that there was no nuclear holocaust
and if that doesnt kill them adams going to tell his father about the internet
the cars pull up and adam lets his parents out
they go bonkers when they see the house
the parents enter first
they are thrilled shocked etc
as a demonstration troy removes a hot cup of coffee from the microwave
helen is happy to see this handy new device
calvin the inventor sticks his head into the machine to investigate its workings
adam demonstrates the vcr to his parents as troy and eve look on
you put the tape in here and you get a movie in your own home
we see the main title to natural born killers come up on the screen
troy and eve rush forward
it has been turned into an office for calvin

helen contd calvin
offering his hand to both thats wonderful
we webber guys have mighty good luck when it comes to women
calvin points out the computer
calvin contd whats that thing
its kind of a combination television typewriter telephone post office type of thing
leading calvin out ill show it to you later
adam and calvin exit the house
they wear baseball gloves and start playing catch
calvin notes the modern construction of his glove but does not comment on it
this is great son just great
by the way eves last name
rus to kov thats not russian is it
her grandparents immigrated here
dad i dont know how to tell you this
and i was going to wait a while but i think
dad there was no bomb
a plane crashed into our backyard
i looked it up in old newspapers
after a while youre sure
the soviet union collapsed without a shot being fired
the cold war is over
thats what everybody believes
did the politburo just one day say we give up
thats kind of how it was
adam throws the ball but calvin makes no attempt to catch it
my gosh those commies are brilliant
youve got to hand it to em
no we didnt drop any bombs
oh yes our evil empire has collapsed
poor poor us
i bet theyve even asked the west for aid
uh i think they have
those cagey rascals
those sly dissemblers
he cant think of another description so he moves on theyve finally pulled the wool over everybodys eyes
have you ever in your life seen a son who did more for his parents
helen comes out with a tray of champagne cocktails
adam says that this is simply how things work
first the parents take care of the children and then the children take care of the parents
he says historically thats how it works
eve and troy are sitting by the window
adam and helen come in to offer cocktails to troy and eve
whenever adam gives me such obviously incorrect information i just smile slap him on the knee and look out the window
why spoil his dreams
theyre such wonderful dreams
the camera wanders off of them and shoots out the glass doors
we see calvin behind the house
measuring off the dimensions for a fallout shelter
calvin continues to measure as we pull way back and up
perry como sings well meet again
