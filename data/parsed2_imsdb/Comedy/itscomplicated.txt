written by nancy meyers a late afternoon sky a red tile roof and the santa barbara coast line frame this party of old friends
a trio plays brazilian music as guests carry drinks and nibble on dessert
the couple who live in this house sally and ted drink champagne as they chat with their closest friends jane and jane is mid fifties and has embraced that fact
she knows is not the new and because of that she is still described by all who know her as beautiful
everything about this womans appearance screams solid
the years have been good to jake
hes never lost his looks his killer smile or his ability to charm
he lifts his glass of champagne
happy happy happy
reminding him anniversary
jake pauses wryly turns to jane making her smile
some things never change
i thought maybe you were drifting
he was pausing
sighs raising his glass happy
you two have led an extraordinarily blessed life
jake contd as long as ive known you both youve always managed to somehow do everything entirely right
thats so true
but honestly how can it be thirty years
when did we do that trip to spain
looks to jane it was for both of our what
god that was a great trip
the two women exchange a quick look when a tall adorable year old boy joins the group holding a bottle of beer
this is oliver sally and teds son

ollie how was graduation

i cant believe im not in school anymore
whens lukes graduation

jane glances across the party and sees agness a free spirited pretty woman in her thirties wearing a sarong over a bathing suit and walking directly toward them
she carries a slice of cake
jane becomes instantly distracted and uncomfortable
how long is luke home before he has to go back for work
only a week
aw thats it

laughs i thought it was sweet how well you and jake were getting along
felt like old times
yeah well we know how to do this by now
it has been ten years
jane hugs sally good bye her eyes landing on agness affectionately rubbing jakes back
as it closes after jane
and sees jane is gone
in jeans and a tank top carrying a carton of books a yoga mat and a small lamp
gabby is jane and jakes middle child
but unlike most middle children this one has never suffered from being ignored
not a possibility with jane as your mother
we are the house is modest and charming and sits on a few acres in the lush green hills of santa barbara
neat rows of vegetables dot the landscape
gabby arrives at her already packed prius where her older sister lauren is trying to fit everything into the trunk
lauren is more conservatively dressed than gabby and has an air of maturity about her
youre never going to fit all this in
you can come back for the rest tomorrow
i cant come back t gabby looks up to see harley laurens fiance in a t shirt and over the knee gym shorts lugging a huge suitcase down the front
path a duffel strapped across his chest
thats all my clothes
sets the suitcase down as he sees an suv heading to the house
harley contd okay your mom is home
shell figure this out
the suv pulls to a stop jane gets out
gabby starts pulling cartons out of her trunk to make room for her clothes
gabby youre leaving now
i thought you were going in the morning
i know but my friends are all there and they wanted me to come tonight
but honey its gonna get dark soon
you cant see out the back window

mom shell be there in a couple of hours shell be fine

we could go to that big bed bath and beyond buy kitchen stuff
gabby can you look up from that thing
looking up i got it covered ma
to harley hey gangsta help me carry these
gabby and harley carry the boxes back into the house
jane seems worried as she watches them
mom are you afraid to sleep in the house alone
what are you
lauren looks doubtful im not
one of you is always moving out
gabby re joins but i am wondering who im gonna watch the hills with
huge hug mamacita
im gonna miss you
jane hugs her back but is aware of not hugging too hard
harley joins the group
im doing this
walks to her car mom you dont happen to know where dad is do you
i tried calling him to say goodbye
he was at sally and teds
how was that
you and them at the same jane turns to him not that its in any way any of my
notices both girls wait for her answer whatever
it was fine

laughs not this time
gabby call me when you get there
do not forget
jane contd gabby texts deep in convo gabby
ill call you
knock em dead little one
and call us when you get there too
and no texting and driving
jane loves that harley said that
gabby gets in her car and starts off
puts his arm around janes shoulder they grow up so friggin fast
i hate it
gabby pulls out of the driveway and out of sight
maybe you should get a dog
oh my god
goodbye you two
heading for their car and getting into the passenger seat love you boss
as lauren and harley drive off jane turns and looks at her suddenly very empty nest
a womans house
books and art collected over years
interesting unexpected pieces of furniture
jane kicks off her heels now feeling short and alone
cramped but clearly a cooks kitchen
the kids have left a few glasses and plates on the island
jane gathers them and as she rinses them at the sink she suddenly and surprisingly feels very alone
she pauses allows herself the moment then forces herself to snap out of it
this is janes other home
a large bright bustling bakery restaurant
the bakery counter could rival any in paris
last year the new york times rated janes pain au chocolat the best in the united states
a line waits to get in
a very relaxed jane is behind the busy counter easily moving between her young staff
the atmosphere is efficient and friendly
jane adjusts a few signs on the counter then reaches inside the display case pulling out a tray of muffins topped with powdered sugar
she carries the tray to the open pass through to the busy kitchen and calls to the head baker
nods to the muffins too much sugar
reynaldo nods as jane hands him the tray
jane notices a line waiting to get up to the bakery counter
knowing what to do janes staff has already set out cups of coffee with lids
who wants coffee while theyre waiting
jane and the staff hand out the free coffee
refills a glass of water checking on her customers
quietly to a young employee check on table five will you
the young employee nods as jane looks up and sees a man on the other side of the counter
they exchange polite hellos when jane notices peter tan and confident approaching her
all smiles peter
peter joins adam the man who stands across from jane
adam is handsome in a way that sneaks up on you
theres something reserved and refreshing about his demeanor
he holds rolled blueprints
jane i cant remember have you ever met adam schaeffer
shrugs awkwardly look what weve got
raises the blueprints your plans
to peter so excited
a farmhouse table almost fills the room
on the walls posters for janes two cookbooks framed food photos and a few reviews
jane peter and adam sit around the table as adam rolls out the blueprints in front of jane
before she looks ive been thinking about this addition for ten years
peter and adam watch as janes eagle eye examines the plan
uh huh uh huh
i like this wall of windows peter
that was adam actually
still perusing then to peter love where you put the stairs
thats so good
did she hear that
oh my god the kitchen
finally i have a real kitchen with four walls
you actually understood what i wanted
jane looks to peter with enormous appreciation
peter looks to adam
jane turns to adam
im happy you like it
finally noticing him okay
shakes his hand laughs hello
you read all my e mails
all of them
jane smiles as her office manager sticks her head in the door
rises oh sorry i have a
can you leave these and ill make a few notes
well actually i have one tiny note now
to adam re plan in my bathroom
no his and her sinks
and you dont think in the future you might want a his
oh god were talking code about my life right
laughs no no didnt mean to be
the truth is in my current bathroom i have two sinks and sometimes the other sink makes me feel bad
not a problem
can we schedule a meeting for next week
does tuesday work for you
eight thirty too early
at the house
ill be there
way too chic for a dentists office
jane sits nervously in a chair in a well styled well upholstered examination room
the door opens quickly and a handsome crisp looking doctor hi
shaking his hand hi
so i just wanted to start with
and please dont take this the wrong way but im the type of person who kind of makes fun of people who get plastic surgery
good because you know some women can look a little fake and plasticky
and in my opinion worse
oh thats good so well as against the whole thing as i am i do have a problem thats been bugging me
my left eyelid is really saggy
i find im sometimes holding it up when im watching tv or reading and i was wondering if thats something you could fix
looking at her closely its resting on your eye lashes
measures her lids with a very tiny ruler actually you have the same amount of excess skin on both sides
well im only interested in fixing one eye
jane what you need to fix this is a brow lift
a brow lift
wh what is that exactly
we surgically cut at your hair line
incision goes right across here
demonstrates on himself by indicating a line drawn like a headband then we just lift the skin up a little tighter across the skull
jane nods already hating this we staple it back in place right above your ears
recovery isnt all that bad but you could be fairly numb and youll probably have a headache that lasts anywhere from say to months
jane flies into the elevator out of breath and a little nauseous
she taps on the lobby button
the elevator moves down
the doors open and jane looks into an empty hallway facing a sign that reads santa barbara fertility center
helping couples become parents
jane hears someone is about to get on the elevator steps back toward the corner
a messy looking year old boy dashes in
jane recognizes him
she looks up and jake and his wife agness in oversized dark shades and a long black dress very angelina jolie get on the elevator obviously mid argument
agness mood seems very dark today
they instantly shut up when they realize jane is in the elevator
pushing the lobby button mumbles perfect
jake jake jake jake
hold on pedro im talking to someone
pedro sits on the floor crashing into the back wall of the elevator
she snaps jane unconsciously holds up her left eyebrow
what are you doing in this building
you dont go to sharon anymore
jane looks at the fertility literature in jakes hand just as jake slips it behind his back
an awful two seconds of silence then jane notices a tattoo of a tiger on agness back
it creeps her out
jake catches janes reaction then thank god the doors open
jake leans down and picks up pedro who instantly climbs up his back
honey dont do that
as they all exit the elevator pedro has now made his way up to jakes shoulders
agness cell rings and as she answers it see you in the big apple
pedro is now resting on jakes head
trying to be nonchalant with a kid on his head smiles see you there
jane and three of her girlfriends are mid meal
the wine is flowing and the women are laughing
trisha has happily never been married
joanne is widowed and diane is divorced
they are all janes age and have been friends forever
that is beyond
laughing when the three of them got in the elevator
between that and the staples and the headache for six months
it was the most insane hour of my life
jake has lost his mind
oh i dont know
first of all he was a complete prick for cheating on you
well cant disagree with that
and then he marries her
a known lunatic
she has a big job
why do you always say that
because she does
she runs the whole marketing department at ky whatever that stations called so shes not that big of a lunatic
janey come on he cheats on you with her your year marriage ends then six months later she leaves jake for some random guy has a baby leaves that guy
marries jake and shes not nuts
groans jo youre so lucky jerrys dead
no i mean you never have to bump into him
rises to get more wine janey you want to meet a guy i met on match
com that i didnt like
gee what a great offer
i dont think so
he wasnt that awful
sounding better every minute
trisha stops at janes seat refilling janes wine glass
you know its not healthy not to have sex for
however long its been
im not not doing it on purpose
i dont know if this is true but i read on line about this woman who hadnt done it in so long her vagina closed up
get out of here
all the women scream
i swear to god
it grew back together
was it ever one piece
all i know is she had to have a vaginaplasty
oh my goddddddd
jane flops over on the table laughing resting her head
lifts her head then talks as if shes in the doctors office dr
i have a little situation that needs fixing
bubbee you want to fix your situation
just date someone
as jane takes that in we camera booms down on park avenue to find jane the girls and harley just out of a cab
the bellman is taking their luggage as the girls spot their brother luke heading toward them
lauren and gabby run to luke hug him commenting on his hair his shoes his jeans his tan
jane lights up when she sees her son hugs him incredibly hard kisses his cheek then another tight squeeze
love when were all in the same time zone
they all cross through the lobby toward the reception desk
so whats up luke
did you decide to have the party
are you guys gonna sleep over
if you give us your bed and change the sheets
they arrive at the reception desk
youre having a party
to reception clerk hi
hopefully next to each other
i have an adler j
in a superior suite park avenue view
oh im sorry here it is
adler j two standard doubles
sorry about that
yeah were not the ones in the superior suite

as jane takes out her credit card
mom is it okay if the girls come with me now and help me set up
and by girls he means the three of us

me and my friends are having this huge thing at our apartment and the girls said theyd help us set up
sees her disappointment were going to be together all day tomorrow
mom its his last night before graduation
do you want me to help or
super sweetly love your credit card
jane rides the elevator carrying both girls jackets and carry ons as well as her own
just as the doors are about to close a good looking couple in their early forties gets on
as they go up
the guy has his hand around the womans waist his fingers fanning her butt
the couple looks at each other smiling privately
jane looks away
two double beds
jane lies on top of one of the beds fully dressed shoes off eyes wide open
jane enters the hotels posh bar restaurant
to host hi
your tables almost ready mrs
would you like to wait at the bar
trying to read upside down reservation list sure
you dont happen to have another adler coming in do you
adler for two
youre our only adler this evening
jane takes a seat next to two hot younger women
to bartender pinot noir please
no you know what
ill have a tanqueray martini very dry with a twist
jane strums the bar top checks out the room
its fun being in a big city
her martini arrives she takes a sip and hears something very familiar
she looks across the bar and sees jake talking to the bartender
he seems to be alone
jake notices her and smiles
jake picks up his drink and carries it to the bar stool next to jane
pedro got the stomach flu so im flying solo
didnt know you knew how to be by yourself
any chance you could just go easy on me
just a one night free pass
noticing her you look good janey
you always do
your hairs shorter
i like it
the host joins them
adler your tables ready
want some company mrs
jane gives jake a doubtful look
we both have to eat
sees jane is hesitating whens the last time we ate a meal together
thinks for a sec just the two of us
so come on
once every ten years
new drinks arrive for jane and jake
physically theyre sitting as close as theyve been in a decade
how are things in the fertility world
checks watch i cant believe it took you this long to bring that up
trying not to laugh sperm issues
the next time you go to a graduation youll be what
fifty eight plus
tries to do the math i think the number youre looking for is
seriously how is that good
why are we talking about this
i thought we were going to have fun
whered you get that idea
the bar has filled up and jane and jake are sitting a little closer together
just tell me how long were you seeing him for
oh please it was five years ago
i know but i always wondered so
the mans married now
i dont care
the bar is now crowded
jane and jake are finally eating but still drinking
jake is telling jane a long story and she cant stop laughing
a dj spins for the after dinner crowd
couples dance on the dance floor
jane and jake both react to the song
this song reminds me of your birthday party
the one in our old house
that was such a fun night
you wore that white halter dress
remembering oh yeahhhh
remembering it all looks at jake with a longing for her own past
want to dance
jake and jane are dancing
its familiar yet with the blush of the new
somethings going on here
jake starts singing
jane joins in
this is by far the loosest weve seen her
of course it helps that shes drunk
they dance around one another without inhibition
a mating dance
astonished laughing youre married to someone else
tell me about it
they both laugh then jake pulls jane close
i know you
looking deeply into her and i know you
theyre in bed and theyve done it
theyre not even entirely undressed
theyre spent sweaty breathing heavily
jake cups his hand on janes vagina gives it a solid pat and hold
home sweet home
jane covers her face
that was one crazy ride
thought we were going to break the bed
not looking good im having an out of body experience
youre so great janey
i forgot how great
please shut up
im so dizzy
and the pilates are payin off by the way
jane moans opens the night table drawer leans over and throws up into it
jane woozily sits up on her side of the bed her back to jake
jake looks over at her
starting to rise look the other way
cause i have to get up
i know what you
look the other way jake
as jake turns away jane runs to the bathroom carrying a pillow covering her bare ass
jake hears her throw up again
jane sits on the floor by the toilet looking wiped out
jake gingerly steps into the bathroom hair a mess wearing boxer shorts and his unbuttoned shirt
looking up at him what is wrong with us
what do you mean
this was amazing
we just had a great time
a great time
this is the dumbest thing two people have ever done
jake sits on the edge of the tub
this is news to him
i dont know
i havent thought it out but off the top of my head id say it was smokin hot so something about it wasnt so dumb
she stares up at him sick as a dog and fyi i like that you stopped getting bikini waxes
youve gone native
i was into it
horrified jane lets out a yelp on her way to throwing up again
the nyu band plays pomp and circumstance as the graduating class of enters the field in caps and gowns
all the families in the bleachers are on their feet applauding
jane in sunglasses is sobbing taking photos
next to her are gabby harley and lauren hooting clapping and screaming there he is
and next in line is jake manning the video camera wiping away tears
on the field luke spots his gang in the bleachers and gives a broad bow
the adlers go crazy especially jane who does a finger whistle
jake looks over at jane with puppy dog eyes
the girls notice assuming their dad is emotional over the ceremony
jane feels jakes glare but wont dare look over at him
gabby nudges her mom to look over at dad
jane turns his way sees that look in his eyes and starts to bawl
the family celebrates over lunch
luke is telling a funny story about something that happened on stage at graduation
jane is the only one not fully chiming in and laughing
she cant seem to move beyond what happened last night
sotto you okay
jake slips off his shoe and rubs his foot up janes leg and under her skirt
jane jumps quickly turning it into a reaction to lukes story
she gives jake a private stare that says stop or ill kill you
i would like to propose a toast to your mother
ive done my part with you guys but jane
you very talented you
gabby im serious
jane you did a magnificent job as you always do
the kids look at one another
whats this about
when i look at the three of you beautiful kids
all grown up i think of all the work your mother did much of it without my help
starts to well up dude

janey i take my hat off to you
out of nowhere sudden appreciation
but thank you
not totally out of nowhere jane

jane holds up her droopy left eye
id like to say something too
no offense to the lovely agness or her charming offspring
the kids stifle laughs not nice
harley stops laughing
but i just want to say i really loved today just being with the original five
luke nods in agreement plus harley but hes like one of us
i dont think weve ever done this before
had a meal together
and hung out like this
you mean other than the first years of your life
i know whats she saying
its been awesome
just for a whole day to be just
they all reflect on that one
the adlers are at the reception desk
jane and jake are next to each other signing their credit card receipts the kids chat behind them
to jane something feels right in the universe again doesnt it
jane looks at him but doesnt answer
she turns to the kids
so whos coming home when
no ones told me the details
jakes cell rings
jane half listens to his conversation
into cell hey
turns away hows pedro feeling
distracted jane focuses on lauren
responding to pedro okay were gonna help pack luke up the three of us leave day after tomorrow and lukes home the end of the week
rejoins finishing his call i will

he was just trying to be nice
okay ive got to hit the road guys
jane contd kisses each kid as they line up thanks for staying
so proud of you
call me if you need me
she arrives at jake pauses speechless kisses her cheek it was really fun
painfully it was
we are looking through a windshield and listening to a self just follow a few basic rules to make your divorce a less hurtful one by breaking the cycle of
accept your ex for who she is
a very big ho
and try to remember when you fell in love and
spotting something there she goes
jogging right past his car listening to her ipod
she doesnt hear him
adam backs up next to her
jane slows down
adam lowers the passenger window
she looks in doesnt recognize him at first
its tuesday morning
are we still okay
im so sorry
can you give me a lift back to the house
quickly cleaning up the front seat sure
come on in
jane gets into the car just in time to hear but perhaps the most important lesson in going through your divorce is to learn to forgive
forgiveness is the key to adam hits the cd knob to turn the cd off but instead he accidentally fast forwards
in spite of your hurt feelings prove to her that you can be a mature adam hits the knob again and this time turns it off a bit mortified
just getting a divorce
then two and a half years ago
embarrassed its been a process
heres the good news
in two more years youll actually begin to feel normal again
in two more years ill begin to feel normal
why am i having trouble seeing that as good news
maybe that was just my experience
oh god i hope so
blue prints are spread on a garden table
adam is drawing as jane watches
so if we move this wall back a bit that can bring the arch forward which is where you really want it right
yes id love that
sketching thought so
i have an idea
what if we move my bedroom like six or eight feet so i can get more of the morning light
jane contd sees adam hesitate not possible
yes but youll wake up in the morning open your bedroom door and fall feet into your kitchen
forgot it was all open up there
but i get where youre headed
let me see what i can do
this property is so great
have you lived here a long time
about ten years
i bought this place right after my divorce but its taken me until now to be able to finally do this
jane and adam are distracted when a porsche noisily pulls up and jake gets out wearing a suit and a chipper attitude
to jane am i interrupting
thrown that hes here hi
no well we were just about done
adam this is my ex husband jake
jake this is adam schaeffer my architect
they shake hands good to meet you
re plans can i take a look
do you mind
adam looks to jane for approval but too late jakes already looking
everythings not worked out yet
youre finally getting the kitchen you always wanted
its not huge
suddenly insecure why dont i show these to you when we get a little closer
jane starts to roll up the blueprints fumbles a little
adam finishes for her
she thanks him with her eyes
so i think next we should stake out the addition
see how it all feels size wise
ill e mail you and well set it up
we did good work today
jake nice meeting you
jake smiles and waves as adam exits walking to his car
turns to jane got time for a cup of coffee
adam cant help but sneak a look back at them
jane waves a bit embarrassed
jane moves nervously around the kitchen opening the fridge taking out juice
why havent you returned any of my calls or e mails
jake come on
this is just too weird
we have to just never do what we did ever again
youre an adulterer and im an awful person basically
i havent slept in days
what we did was just so wrong on so many levels
and it was so right on a couple of levels too
finally settles no
on no levels was it right
you cant say we didnt enjoy each others company
sitting at the bar dancing
she doesnt want to be reminded come on you and i havent had fun like that in a hundred years
because were not supposed to have fun like that
are you like what
unhappy at home
does she not understand you
did you just want to know what it would be like with someone my age
what is this
id be lying if i said i never think about you janey
i think about you
and no its not perfect at home
look at me
ive got three grown kids and im going to kindergarten interviews
im a walking cliche
and i cant literally cant stop thinking about what happened in new york
fate brought us together once maybe it happened again
and i know
youve moved on with your life i get it but you cant deny something real and honest happened that night
cant we just go with it see where it takes us
no one has to know
jane shudders you were so great
so loose and sexy
how often do you get to be like that
you can run and open restaurants and build your perfect kitchen but what about having someone to hold you in the middle of the night
not high on my list these days
but what if that someone is someone whos known you since youre and loved you for most of your life
i forgot what a good lawyer you are
give this a shot janey
life is short and its tough
dont discount what we have with each other
hes getting to her you know what they say
people in nursing homes who have plants live longer than the people without plants
oh so youre saying you think this is a healthy choice for me
honey i know it is
and the plants get watered
jane and jake have done it again
in broad daylight and sober
they catch their breath
oh god its official
were having an affair
why do you need to label everything
because thats what this is
yes in its crassest form maybe if we were two other people
just because we were married for years does not not make this an affair
okay but since we were together for so long its not really that wrong
you want to run that logic by your wife
jane fans herself
do me a favor youre on my side
can we switch
i feel disoriented
since when is this your side
since ten years ago
they switch sides
in the middle of this maneuver jake lands on top of jane
could i interest you in a little
they flop onto the opposite sides of the bed
jane fans herself
turns to her why do you think the sex is so much sexier this time
i dont know
jane pulls the sheet up
they look at one another
he gets her to smile
ive gotta get to work
moans as he sits up then rises jake starts to get dressed
jane watches him from bed checking out his stomach
indicating his belly see what happens when youre not looking out for me
pats it she lets me eat everything
pasta cream cheese
can you hand me my robe
jake reaches for janes robe hands it to her
she indicates jake should turn around
why do i have to
because the last time you saw me standing up naked i was in my forties
jake cant believe this things look different lying down
jake rolls his eyes turning away from her
youve gotten a little nuts
slipping into her robe jake i think it would be really good for us to not talk for a few days
turning back to her you know what i think just for the record
i think were doing something kinda brilliant
all the things that tore us apart arent issues anymore
id say our problems actually went away
didnt you always say you felt you werent being heard
wasnt that our big issue both of us always feeling rejected and unappreciated
look at us now
youre so much more together youre not exhausted all the time youre not catering every weekend and busy all day with the kids and im calmer less obsessed about work
im a partner
we grew into the people we wanted each other to be
and i dont know
i appreciate things about you i couldnt even see before
not wanting to get into it really
jane contd well you know im not as good as you at remembering all the details of our
getting dressed do you remember never having time for sex
now look at us
weve already done it two times this week and its only tuesday
i swear to god if half the couples who got divorced could get back together years later their problems would be solved
i think were on to something
not sure i agree and
also were not back together
and i know other divorced people think about this
they wonder what if
fixes his tie i think this is very french of us
how is this french of us
i have a young wife but im having sex with my old wife
not old you know
i didnt mean old
jane tosses jake his jacket
they exit the bedroom and head toward the front door
youre doing that thing where you act like youre not listening
but think about what im saying okay
then do you have any of your homemade granola here
i havent had it in so long
you miss it
we sell it for
a bag at the store
yeah why give it away when you can
jane opens the front door and moves him outside kiss good bye
jane kisses him on the cheek
she wants to be courted
as he heads for his car i can do that
turns back and honey thanks for the
indicates sex with his fingers coffee
jane cant close the door fast enough
jane carries three beautiful homemade pies arriving in the living room where her friends are gathered
platters of food and open bottles of wine are on the coffee table
oh my god now what
this is a feast
i dont know whats going on i have so much energy lately which i think is probably a result of
all the sex im having
the ladies laugh yeah

jane walks through the busy kitchen holding a sheet of paper
her shirt is a little more fitted
her make up a little prettier
she crosses to the head baker whos just taking a tray of cookies out of the oven
reynaldo im changing the breakfast menu want to give it a little more life

another chef in the kitchen nods in agreement

whatever it is its workin
he winks at jane as he stirs cookie batter
jane blushes as her cell phone rings
i didnt do this again
camera moves in on adam waiting by a ladder in the middle of the field
janes addition is staked out with orange tape
rushing toward adam
adam im so sorry
my mind is just
if i were your shrink id say maybe you dont really want to build this house
thats completely not true
im really sorry

and from here to there

pretends to sit were at either end of the table
laughs at adam feels perfect
i thought so too
taking it all in this is heaven
its gonna be cool
want to go upstairs
so if you were lying in bed this would be your view
jane breaks into a smile
over this tranquil view a cell rings
jane takes her phone out of her pocket sees its jake calling
she pauses then pushes ignore and then promptly loses her balance
adam immediately reaches over and steadies her
grabs her heart yeah
water is running in the sink even though no ones at the sink
jake is in the shower stall fully dressed putting away his cell
he quietly pushes the shower door open and then carefully shuts it with a small snap
jake fake coughs and then turns off the sink water
he checks his watch when he hears glass breaking in another room then hears agness calling his name in anger
jake quietly unlocks the bathroom door and exits to find his path is blocked by pedro who sits on a tricycle staring up at him
what were you doing in there
going to the bathroom
the toilet didnt flush
yes it did
why were you in the shower with your clothes on
making sure agness doesnt hear what are you talking about
i heard the shower door close
what do you have x ray ears
agness joins in briefs and a white tank black bra peeking through
she holds a broom
whats up pedro
jake took a shower with his clothes on
whats he talking about
i dont speak pedro
thats your department
to pedro dont go in the kitchen p i broke something
to jake annoyed yo
can you help
agness exits back to the kitchen as pedro stares at jake
these open faced fancy french grilled cheese sandwiches are carried to janes counter
were jane very professionally places the croque monsieurs onto two waiting plates adds some salad on the side
adam stands nearby with a glass of wine jacket off
that looks amazing
its called a croque monsieur
its one of the first things i learned to make when i lived in paris because the ingredients are really really cheap
when did you live in paris
in my early twenties
i went there to take a six day pastry class and ended up staying a year working as an apprentice in a bakery
jane places the plates at the island as she and adam sit side by side
jane raises her wine glass
thank you for taking my e mails and turning them into something so beautiful
you are rapidly becoming one of the most appreciative clients ive ever had
well im not all that used to being able to count on anyone
surprised by that really
he squints looking ahead sees and adams car parked out front
jake turns off his headlights slowly pulling around to the side of the house
i know its none of my business but
im trying to figure out why someone like you is divorced
and whatd you come up with
something in the youre too nice department
yes that and my wife fell in love with my best friend
ex best friend
we were all on a biking trip he and his wife me and my wife
through tuscany and on the last day of the trip they announced they were in love
not a great plane ride home
i can imagine sitting there for eleven hours with your wife who you know is oh thats rough
actually they went on to venice and i flew back with carol his wife
you cant imagine what its like to sit next to someone whos been crying for ten straight hours
i dont blame her
i was talking about me
anyway theyre married now and its pretty much an ongoing awful thing
but you and your ex
when i saw him stop by for a cup of coffee the other morning i thought wow
thats the way its supposed to be
you two seem to have it all figured out
were not as figured out as youd think
jake in work out clothes sprints across the front lawn careful not to be seen
jane clears their dishes
laughs you know i hope you dont feel ive been interrogating you but
jane contd i know what its like to have your ex remarried and to not have so much going on in that department
i mean do you date ever or
uh constantly actually
everyone i know or have ever known has fixed me up
and then sometimes i just meet women i dont know how that happens but
but no girlfriend
jane stands on the other side of the island and hands adam another croque monsieur
she stays on her side like a waitress at a counter
she refills his water glass
just like to date
actually i find it really stressful
you know the last time i was in the dating world was
its a little more complicated these days
i cant tell you how nice it is to have a conversation with a woman and have the pressure off
not to mention a home cooked meal that no one else i know could possibly cook
janes not sure if she feels a little hurt by that
she smiles wiping the counter
that was a compliment
so you dont have a guy in your life at the moment
starts to say something
jake rises from the bushes outside of janes kitchen window
he peeks in the window balancing himself precariously on a stack of loose bricks
he sees jane telling adam a story and both of them cracking up
jake leans in further to try to hear what janes saying when the bricks slip under his feet he loses his balance and drops out of the frame
jane walks adam to the door
he holds rolled blueprints
this was so nice and relaxing and the lavender ice cream was actually the best dessert of any sort ive ever had
like in my life
aw thank you
i always make ice cream when i cant sleep so im glad someone was here to eat it
opens door pauses
great getting to know you a little
nods it was really fun
adam waves jane waves
definitely a little sweet awkward
jane closes her door starts turning out lights heading for the kitchen when theres a quick knock on the front door
jane quickly returns to the door and opens it to find leaning in the door frame
i thought hed never leave
entering hello jane you look very beautiful tonight
he takes her in his arms
love when you smell like butter
easing away what are you doing here
its nine oclock
where does your wife think you are
shall we do some downward facing dog
not tonight big guy
they cross into the kitchen
is it really necessary for you to always say no before you say yes
i wont think less of you you know
really jake im a little tired i was just gonna take a bath
so well just hang out
now in the kitchen he sees the dinner dishes on the counter ooooo is that croque monsieur
whos plate is this
yours or his
eats her leftovers savors the taste oh my god just as i remember it
dont you ever eat at your house
pedro dictates all meals and he has a very limited palate
sees melted ice cream what kind of ice cream is that
immediately not sleeping
not at all
never slept better
and my digestion is finally back on track
youve turned my world right side up jane
you know what this means dont you
that ive never really known how to live without you
jane takes a bubble bath
jake lies on the floor leaning against the tub his back to her eating a bowl of ice cream
maybe we should be growing old together
hate to tell you big guy but we already grew old apart
whats with the big guy
is that because you think im fat or is it a term of endearment
i have no idea why i keep saying that
then i love how quiet it is in your house
i have no quiet in my life
yeah well you live with a five year old
and dont forget pedro
jane splashes him
so what does that mean exactly
whats going on over there at your place
my marriage is
not turning out as i hoped
agness started out really looking up to me
we never used to fight but now
with the kid
lately were all about where hes gonna go to school and now she says we need a bigger house more help
i was thinking of cutting back at work
now thats never gonna happen
and she wants another baby before pedro gets too old which i get but since were always fighting
oh god listen to me
isnt a baby part of the deal when you marry a woman that age
i guess so
shes got me booked at the fertility center every other day and shes so amped up on hormone injections i may need to find an exorcist if she doesnt calm
jane laughs i wish it was funny
finishes his ice cream incredible ice cream
im turning around
as he turns jane shrinks in the tub remember when we used to smoke pot and eat your ice cream in the hot tub
the hot tub
that feels like a billion years ago
how long has it been since you
indicates smoking a joint me
since before lauren was born
jake slips a joint out of his shirt pocket twirls it
are you kidding me
put that away
its been too long
im not going to
okay why dont i leave this with you
its kind of amazing
maybe youll take a few hits
jake contd get your sea legs then well smoke the rest of it together
jake places the joint in a drawer
so that nerdy architect likes you
you know that right
hes not nerdy and he definitely doesnt
were working together
i was watching when you bent down to open the oven his eyes were glued to your ass
changing the subject hey will you do me a favor
jake is on a small ladder changing a light bulb in the chandelier
jane in a robe stands beneath him
looking down at her smiles tell the truth janey is this a great affair or what
i dont know
its my first
climbing down we dont even have to have sex and its fun
arrives next to her i wish i could sleep over
i gotta tell my shrink about this
this is a lot to handle
i guess you should go
im sure yogas probably closed by now
jane contd oh you got a little ice cream on your shirt
let me get that out
jake takes jane in his arms and gives her a deep hug
he lingers kissing her neck smelling her skin
she kisses him on the cheek
he slides her robe off her shoulder
he softly caresses her shoulder kissing it then makes his way up her neck
jane gives in and kisses jake fully on the lips
he pulls her close her robe falling
wow wow wow
whats happening jake
the phone rings
dont get it
i always get it
i have three kids
jake wishes she wouldnt
she hesitates picks it up hello
makes an i told you so face you still on the plane
how was luke when you left
oh that sounds like fun
let me know what i can bring
dont have any idea where he is
points to jake okay honey talk to you tomorrow
hangs up now im lying
lauren and harley are giving luke a graduation party this weekend
jakes cell phone rings sees its lauren calling
into phone hello stranger
jane opens the door and jake darts over for a quick kiss and then exits toward his car
they wave to one another
into phone just getting in my car
let me know what i can bring
jake looks to jane
she shakes her head hes shameless
jane watches as jake drives off talking on his cell
jane paces outside of a medical building holding a box from her bakery
shes clearly waiting for someone
she spots a comfortably dressed man in his mid forties holding the leash of an airedale and approaching the buildings entrance
approaching him dr
surprised to see her jane
am i seeing you today
no i just need to talk
and i was wondering if there was any chance you could squeeze me in for an emergency session
im sort of desperate for some advice
i brought you some of that coffee cake you like
not as a bribe or anything
checks his watch i only have twenty minutes until my first patient
ill talk fast
allen and the dog walk the corridor
whispering so at this point i just need some sound unbiased guidance
is having an affair with you know who a good thing or a bad thing
they stop at dr
allens office door its a bad thing right
how could it be good
opening his door its not good
its not bad
not what she needs to hear
jane sits in a chair across from an empty chair
allen turns on a few lamps as his dog settles
you know things happen in life and our job is to find out why
what we have to do is take a real look at this
are you ready to do that
ive made a list of what this can possibly be about
at my end
can i read it to you
taking his seat of course
digging out her blackberry thanks
i e mailed it to myself
reads from blackberry okay
am i still trying to figure out why the marriage failed
do i want to get back together
do we have unfinished business
is this about revenge
am i just
or is it my caretaker thing
jane contd you know the kids are finally gone and now all of a sudden jakes back and i get to take care of him in some way
allen nods impressed with the work shes done
and listen i get how therapy works i do
we look at things we examine them weeks turn into months what
were going on eight years right
and im okay with that i like it
but in this case i need to know what you really think
like id like you to say
dont do this its absolutely wrong or go ahead youll be fine
i actually want to be told what to do
whats interesting is im already seeing you open up more than i have in some time
im thinking through this affair you may learn to view the world in a different way
i need more concrete
are you saying i should keep seeing him
because honestly if the guilt and fear could go away maybe i could let go a little and figure this out
i wouldnt resist looking at this
mulls that over quickly okay
and another way of saying that is
let go jane
it cant hurt
jane fist pumps in the air
jake is in the waiting room with several other older men all with their much younger wives
a nurse enters holding a chart
one of the younger women whispers
the nurse shows jake into a windowless room with a sink a pleather barcalounger a tv and a dvd player
okay you know the drill
you can hang your things in the closest the remote is on top of the tv and the materials are in the drawers
cleaning the remote with an anti bacterial wipe please deposit your specimen in the cup and ill see you when youre done
she dims the light before leaving
jake takes off his jacket tosses it on the chair slips off his shoes takes off his pants sits for a sec when his phone rings
he looks at the name of the caller
on her cell hey where are you

can you do it now
i have about an hour
thought we could go to the stanhope

shes nervous just saying it rising be there in ten

jake rushes to put on his pants catches his foot in the pants hem hops to safety
he reaches for his jacket then grabs an anti bacterial wipe using it to turn the door knob
harley and lauren are having lunch in the cafe connected to the lobby
harley has a clear view of the lobbys reception desk
lauren has her back to it
lukes so excited about his party
we can fit forty people in our place cant we
sure if nobody wants to sit down
notices jake entering the hotel hey theres your
harley then realizes jake is signing the register and checking in and chokes on his french fry
starts to turn harley grabs laurens face in his hands and kisses her even though hes choking
he coughs while kissing her
im sorry i didnt mean to spit on you
i just needed to kiss you
while you were choking
im not choking anymore
harley swallows a cough reaching for his water his eyes on jake as jake is handed a room key and pointed toward the elevator
harley drinks his entire glass of water as he watches
turning who did you just see
luckily jake is now gone
thought it was your cousin
harley falls silent as he sees jane enter the hotel and cross to the reception desk
after a sec shes pointed toward the same elevator
ohhhh my sweet lord
looks up from her salad now what
honey i totally forgot i have a conference call at i gotta get back to the office
honey stop eating get the waiter
call the one over there
pointing her away from jane harley we cant leave were meeting with the wedding specialist
watches as jake waits for jane around the corner yeah you know what
todays not a good idea to do that
sees jane join jake they step into the elevator and immediately fall into each others arms and kiss oh my god
the curtains are drawn the lights are low
jane in a hotel robe slips a cd in the cd player and we hear a mellow song perfect for love in the afternoon
the bathroom door opens and jake exits also in a hotel robe
jane stands across the room from him
they smile at one another
from behind we see jane untie her robe letting it fall to the floor
jake looks at her from head to toe and back
they smile at one another then something comes over jake
his eyes roll back his legs give out and he collapses against the wall
the hotels wedding specialist has joined lauren and harleys table
she holds a binder filled with photos
harley is a mess knowing whats going on upstairs
i adore october weddings
let me show you what we did last october
she opens her book of photos for lauren
rising honey im gonna make that phone call from the
lauren and the wedding specialist dont look up and dont hear him
they keep talking to each other
you just keep doing that and ill
they still dont look up
harley nervously heads for the lobby when he spots the hotel doctor bag in hand arriving at the reception desk
whats the room number
his wife said hes conscious now
taking off on my way
harley stops in his tracks freaking
jake is under the covers in his robe a blood pressure cuff around his arm
jane still in her robe paces
the hotel doc sits on a chair next to jakes side of the bed
your blood pressures good
hows his heart
do you have a heart condition mr
and i just had a check up
oh thats good
listening to his heart deep breath
so no chest pain
when you got dizzy did you feel your heart was beating funny
yes but i was admiring my beautiful
indicates jane jane holds up her weak eyelid
well thats nice to hear after all these years
winds up his stethoscope did you forget to take any of your medications today
took em all
what all did you take
lipitor baby aspirin
sitting on the bed flomax
embarrassed yes otherwise i pee times a day
how long have you been taking the flomax
not that long
and i only take it sporadically
i have to sneak it actually
explains confidentially it reduces semen and thats not good for my wife right now
to jane sorry
looks over at jane really
yes i prefer a lot of semen
rises okay well thank you so much for coming
looks like hes gonna live so
packing up yeah my guess is flomax is probably the culprit here
it can definitely give you a sudden drop in blood pressure so i suggest you stay off it for a few weeks which apparently your wife will appreciate
holds in a chuckle yeah
really good for me
the doctor snaps his bag shut rises
and i suggest you rest quietly for the rest of the afternoon
to jane no hanky panky mrs
i assure you
harley sits on a bench with his head between his legs
lauren arrives joins him on the bench
are you acting like this because of the wedding
tell me the truth
head down not at all
swear to god
because i dont want to be one of those couples where the guy goes into a coma the whole time we plan the wedding
its not worth it to me
harley looks up sees the hotel doc walk by the reception clerk
the doc gives her a wink and a thumbs up and keeps on walking
deep sigh rises okay
were back in business
in jane and jakes room
sitting up in bed in their robes watching oprah and eating chicken soup on trays
jake reaches for the salt
jane eases it away from him
jake looks over at jane oozing with love and appreciation
just that move
you have no idea
not everyones like that
mutes oprah then jake i have a confession to make
back when we broke up
i knew it wasnt all your fault
you mean that
youve never said that to me before
because when you cheated i didnt have to
but i think in some way i gave up on us and im not sure you ever really did
i still havent
jake takes janes hand
she looks down at his wedding ring then turns her eyes back to oprah
a beat then
are you and agness
still having sex
jake doesnt answer
jane turns looks right at him
only if she initiates it
im trying not to rock the boat at home until you and i figure this out
sees her reaction this is a little trickier at my end than yours
now i know youre gonna think im leaving because of what you just said but im not
i really have to get back to work
takes janes hand we got really close there for a moment
she knows hes right
janes cell rings
she lets it ring again then answers it
into phone hello
into phone hi hope im not interrupting anything
jake is instantly jealous
he rises crosses to the closet starts dressing his eyes glued to jane who seems to be very engaged by adam
i just found out theres a french film festival in town and that made me think of you so i was wondering if youd like to go to the opening
night tomorrow night
a little nervous
will she accept
oh that sounds so fun
jake rolls his eyes let me think tomorrows what
desperate whispers say youre busy

hates lying jake crosses to her smiles im so sorry

i would love that
jake smiles appreciatively crosses to jane hugs her
we see he is holding two movie tickets
he looks at them then crosses to the desk of a female worker
melanie how would you and your husband like two tickets to the opening of the french film festival
jane and jake are finishing getting dressed moving about putting on shoes blouses ties jackets belts

jake grabs his heart
jane leans on him a smile on her face as we begin to hear music
music plays from the outdoor speakers
jane sets the table in her courtyard
shes singing along with the music
sits on the kitchen counter
jane finishes off icing the cake like the pro she is then peeks into the oven looks at her perfect roast chicken
jane clips the price tag off of a new dress and slips it off its hanger
tells us its
his eyes glued to the clock
we are in jake and agness bedroom
jake and agness lie on their bed both doing paper work
pedro is asleep between them
jake gets up slipping his cell into his hand
not looking at him why are you taking your cell to the bathroom
didnt mean to
places it back on the night stand carry him to his bed will you
jake carefully lifts pedro off the bed
while reading and hurry back
why do you think i cancelled my dinner
agness pulls her t shirt over her head
she is gorgeous
jake gently lies pedro in his bed pulls up the covers
pedro takes jakes hand holds it to his chest looking up at him
jake offers a comforting smile and pedro closes his eyes
jake sits on the bed and lets pedro fall back asleep holding onto his hand
candles are lit on the table but are now low
the table is set with flowers from the garden
the wine has not been opened
camera cranes to find jane inside the kitchen still dressed for dinner and deep in thought
she then sighs very deeply and decisively as she turns out the lights and room by room the house becomes dark
the kids cars are in the driveway
jane gabby lauren and harley are in the kitchen cooking setting the table opening wine chatting
oh mom i keep forgetting to tell you about our meeting at the stanhope
we went there for lunch two days ago and met with their wedding specialist
i think that could be the place mom
two days ago you went to the stanhope
yes and guess what
we saw nothing
jane and harley connect
he immediately looks away
what is that supposed to mean
who wants wine
starts pouring looking in the fridge mom you have an insane amount of food in here even for you
taking out last nights roast chicken i knew you were all going to be here for the weekend so i made a bunch of stuff last night
looks like jake adlers favorite meal to me
laughs very funny
jane looks to harley again when they all hear a car horn honk
jane looks out the window and sees jakes porsche pull up with luke in the passenger seat
the girls rush out the kitchen door
harley sees jake getting out of the car and pours himself a larger glass of wine as jane approaches him
just then luke enters and jane lights up
hugs luke surveying all the food mom this looks amazing
harley and luke hug talk the talk
sheepishly joins the group eyes on jane hi
harley takes a huge gulp of his wine
holding lukes backpack where should i put this
turns her back on him making herself busy wherever
harley watches their interaction tennis match style
jake looks at the table set for five wishes he was joining them
he sees last nights dinner now being served as left overs
jane slices the roast chicken
that looks incredible
jane looks up at him knife poised
is he kidding
she goes at the chicken with the knife slicing off a leg
glass of wine
not looking up no thank you
jakes cell rings
he turns his back to take it
into cell hi ag

jane has a hot flash
starts fanning herself
into cell okay i will

pouring another drink nobody wants wine but me
luke opens a cupboard takes out a bottle of olive oil hands it to jake

janey can i talk to you privately

jane heads out still holding the carving knife
harley slips the knife out of her hand

jane and jake stand in the courtyard off of the living room
what is it jake
i dont get not calling me back
cause i dont care what your excuse is
shuts the door to the living she didnt go out jane
she cancelled her plans and every time i tried to call or write she caught me
i wanted to be here

you were worried about rocking the boat at home
well now youre rocking my boat and i dont like it
stopping her honey dont let one night
you dont understand
im not even blaming you
i fully participated in this
but i dont want to do it anymore
the last thing in the world i should be right now is your mistress sitting around at nine at night wearing heels and perfume and blowing out candles and wrapping
everything in saran wrap because your wife cancelled her plans
it was cliche and humiliating
wistfully you lit candles
oh shut up
look ive had a pretty good life these past years
i figured it out and i moved on
i no longer feel alone or divorced
i just feel normal
you know how long that took just to get my balance back
the point is im going in the wrong direction here
but the worst part is
its feeling like it used to feel
all the little untruths that are hard to catch but add up
janey cmon it was one mistake
joining them everything okay out here
jane and jake turn the kids are gettin hungry
walks away pauses in front of harley we were just
as she passes none of my beeswax jane
once shes gone and please never tell me
rubs her arm taking jake back inside yeah
so were going to see you tomorrow night for sure right
harley starts to follow them out when jane grabs his shirt sleeve
what did you see and what do you know
jane gives him a look that could get blood from a stone
confesses rapidly okay he checked in you arrived you met in the elevator possible kiss there doctor went up doctor came down thumbs up
have no idea what happened in between
have you told lauren
no and i wont joining them mom
jane and harley enter from the courtyard just as jake is about to leave
jane immediately crosses to the table which now has dinner on it
lauren kisses jake good bye on the cheek then joins the others who are about to sit down for dinner
from the dining room thanks for picking me up dad
jake pauses awkwardly at the door
he cant catch janes eye
he waves to the kids who dont seem to notice then heads out
jake exits turns back looks inside the dining room sees his family sitting around the table talking laughing
he heads toward his car as
glances out the window at jake as he drives off
one of the kids says something distracting her and she laughs
harley and luke on ladders are stringing paper lanterns across a small patio
lauren crosses under them carrying a tray of food and joins gabby who is setting out drinks
jane sits at her dressing table dressed for the party
she puts on hoop earrings likes the way she looks
she opens a drawer to take out a lipstick
sitting among her cosmetics is the joint jake left for her
she looks at the joint then looks at herself in the mirror
he looks adorable and carries a gift the size of a book
he knocks in a playful rhythm
very happy to see her
you look fantastic
im feelin a little fantastic
she opens the door a little wider and we now see shes eating a gi normous piece of cake
trying not to react to that enters handing her the gift
this is for you
come on in
takes a huge bite of cake can you hold this for a sec
hands him the cake plate oh my god
takes another bite this could be the best cake i ever made
you want a piece
i think im good
focusing on the gift i cant believe you brought me a gift
jane unwraps the gift turns it around looks at it
an appointment book
i sort of assumed you didnt have one
because i never remember our
i took the liberty of filling in our next two meetings
and marked them with post its and wrote them in red and then highlighted them in neon yellow
jane kisses adam on the cheek just as he was moving and the kiss lands on his lips
did he really say that
then he licks his lips wow that cake is good
jane laughs a little too hard
so let me ask you something and please dont think im weird or out of line or anything
but do you by any chance poke smot
i mean do you smoke pot
i havent asked anyone that question since i was twenty two
no i dont
but i have
but i dont think ive had any since my kids were born
so not in like years
oh my god we have kids the same age
and i havent had any since my kids were born either
except for tonight
i had one hit off of this
jane pulls the joint out of her purse just as they pull up next to a police car
you might not want to hold that quite so
nods hello officer
turns sees the cop car gasps and drops the joint then turns to cop waves then i actually know him
blueberry scone and a latte
the cop nods pulls away oh my god
that was horrifying
i instantly saw myself in a mug shot
my heart is leaping out of my
then distracted wow
this is the most insane dashboard ive ever seen
its like were in a cockpit
adam what kind of car is this
turns to him hi
did you get this high from one hit
i dont know what theyve done to pot over the last years but it rockkkkks
from outside we can see lots of folks in the living room
candles dot the path up to the cottage door
several couples and college kids are walking toward the house
jane and adam are sharing the joint
jane takes a tiny lady like hit passes it to adam
whispers dont take too much its really strong
she blows out the smoke
adam on the other hand takes a huge hit
while holding in the smoke i havent had fun in almost three years jane
takes another huge hit bring
walk past the bushes
whos got the reefer
fake falsetto no one
keep walking please
the kids laugh
jane and adam two very straight laced grown ups enter the party pausing as they peruse the crowd
how you feeling
adam starts to move to the music insanely well and then just insanely
lauren and harley greet them
jane greets them back with a huge hug
love your dress
adam this is my oldest lauren and her fiance harley
giggles to kids were on a date
adam and jane stifle laughs
jane and adam chat with all the kids
looks like its going great adam is a big hit
jake nurses a drink and is not looking happy
he sees the kids disperse finishes off his vodka ready to make his move
they havent seen jake yet
starts moving to the music jane laughs by the way how great is this party
lets be the last to leave
bops to the music then room seriously eyeing him
adam contd hey theres your ex husb uh oh
hes headed right toward us
not the time to be feeling groovy dances again when he sees jake in slow mo getting closer and closer oooo
why so intense big fella
adam slides a bit behind jane as jake arrives with agness who looks inappropriately youthful
all smiles hey good to see you again
adam this is agness jakes wife
suddenly realizing now that is an odd sentence for me to say since that was me for most of my life
how weird is that
both of us married to the same man
dismissing the idea you know
hey what are you gonna do
yeah why go there
at this point adam gets hit with a severe case of the giggles
as the rest continue he cant keep a straight face
because there is
i mean when you think about it it sort of links us in some cosmic crazy way doesnt it agness
of all the men on the planet we both said i do to this guy
twenty five years apart
i know youre having like an ah ha moment but i think im gonna get a refill
adam good meeting you
whispers to jane as agness exits shes got a really scary tattoo
janey can i talk to you for a quick sec
jake nods his head toward the bathroom and heads for it
jane looks to adam
he always needs me for a quick sec
starts to exit you okay
oh im very okay
jane and jake are crammed into an extremely tight space
whats going on
youre acting insane
whispers giddily im stoned
you smoked the joint i gave you
you told me to
its a mazing
but you werent supposed to smoke it with him youre supposed to smoke it with me
yes of course
why shouldnt i be
what am i jake
youre my ex wife lover oldest friend and girlfriend
jane blurts out a laugh
and because of that even though i kind of hate you love you im going to let you have some
you love me
i mean i heard hate had top billing but
jane takes the joint out of her purse lights it up and hands it to jake
just as she does that the door opens and harley enters thinking the bathroom is free
jake quickly yanks him in shuts the door locks it
harley is now caught between jane and jake and a cloud of smoke
oh my god youre smoking weed in the guest bathroom
yes we are and wed appreciate it if you didnt tell anyone about this
adding it to the list
care for a toke
i dont really smoke marijuana
blowing out smoke me either
okay one hit
looks at herself in the mirror
jane contd oh my god
is that what i look like
a small group is dancing to a hip hop song on the patio
adam and agness are dancing together
theyre totally into it
jane makes her way to the dance floor as the song ends and the beach boys wouldnt it be nice begins
jake follows jane dancing his way toward the crowd spinning gabby on his way
jake takes janes hand
dances with her
harley arrives next to lauren and gabby who watch their parents
they must be hammered
or something like that
adam glances over and sees jane and jake
to agness sweetest divorced couple in the world
agness is surprised by how happy jake looks with jane
spotting adam hey
to jake jake im gonna
jane and adam cross toward one another
jake dies a little as jane leaves him her eyes on adam
jake doesnt notice agness is watching him
jane now dancing with adam looks from adam to jake then back to adam and then doesnt look back at jake again
jake is still as he watches the woman he loves slip away
agness has her eyes firmly on jake not missing any of it
adam drives jane home
clearly the end of a great night
fun is not overrated is it
you know whats great
how much i like you
really touched thank you
i really like you a lot too
you didnt say a lot
but i was thinking it
im not too old for you
how can you be too old for me when im older than you
i just figured all these women you get fixed up with are thirty five
your age is one of my favorite things about you
she appreciates that do you think you have any more of that chocolate cake at your house
and we are in the bakery at one a
jane turns on a few more lights but keeps it a bit moody
officially now the best date of my life
pre or post divorce
so basically i can make you anything on the menu or even not on the menu
just name it
scans the blackboard menu what about a
warm chocolate croissant
jane flours and rolls croissant dough as adam now in an apron watches chatting with her
jane then places the dough in a machine called a sheeter
the dough slides into the sheeter and then slides back out bigger and flatter
watching the sheeter mesmerized
next jane folds the flattened dough measures it with a yard stick then cuts it into sections
she takes one of the sections spreads it on a marble slab and very quickly cuts it into triangles
shes a whiz at this
then jane shows adam how to stretch the triangles of dough
nervous at first he gets the hang of it
then jane teaches adam how to place a bar of chocolate in each triangle and roll it into a croissant
laughing as they work they make a dozen croissants
into the oven
jane and adam sit at a table in the corner a stack of croissants piled high between them
music plays as adam takes the top croissant and jane takes the next
bites into it oh
smelling hers mmmmmmmm
its crazy how good this is
biting into one nods yeah and im not even stoned anymore
neither am i
happy about that oh then
do you remember when i asked you the other night if you were dating anyone and you said no
it sounded to me like you were maybe saying yes
i was sort of seeing someone
but its over now
adam nods honestly
cause im not strong enough to fall for someone whos with someone else
wouldnt be able to take that again
i wouldnt say it was over if it wasnt
adam takes janes hand in his
adam turns janes hand over and looks at it a bit quizzically
explains cooking scar
from a very hot batch of caramel
what about that one
that ones from boiling sugar
i wasnt very skilled in the beginning
and that one is from a large french
adam presses janes palm to his lips and kisses her scar
adam then kisses the burn on her forearm
jane sighs closes her eyes
this feeling is unexpected
she opens her eyes as adam moves closer
would it be okay if i
he kisses her great
i was going to say kiss you
if you feel this is in any way wrong because were working together
he smiles as she folds into him and they kiss and kiss and kiss again
jane enters from the garden humming wouldnt it be nice
luke enters still looking half asleep in his t shirt and boxers
what time did you get in
have no idea
lauren and harley drove me home
joining im surprised you remember that
turns to see lauren hi
i didnt know you slept here
lauren in an open robe over drawstrings and a tank top takes out a box of cereal
we were playing scattagories with gabby and ollie then harley fell asleep on the couch
harley meanders in wearing victoria secret heart patterned pj bottoms and a girls v neck t shirt
i got cold in the middle of the night
lauren and jane laugh
okay who wants what
noticing gabby entering hi baby
looks out the front window whats dad doing here
everyone looks out the window and sees jake sitting in his porsche
jane exits as jake steps out of his car
he looks like hes had a rough night and has something on his mind
jane cautiously looks back at the house
the kitchen windows are all open
quietly everything okay
i left agness
no dont say that
she saw it my eyes janey
that im still in love with you
i admitted it i told her about us and ive left her
no no no
what do you mean
jake this is crazy
worried the kids will hear whispers are you telling me the truth
nods this feels so right jane
as jane is about to respond gabby exits the house in her pjs looking confused
from the porch whats going on
honey set the table ill be right in
mom youre the only one who cares if the tables set
okay then do it for me
just go in please
luke and lauren join gabby on the porch
whats up dad
having some problems on the home front just wanted to talk to your mom for a sec
jane shakes her head
why did he have to say that
harley joins the kids
problems on the home front
is one of you seeing someone else
hearing that harley does a swift about face and goes right back inside
janes eyes widen toward jake
off janes cue no its nothing like that
i just need to find a hotel or something for a few days til i get my head together
its that serious
mom can dad stay here for a few days
he can share my room
i dont think thats the best idea luke
daddy are you crying
he turns away from the kids
the tears could be for dramatic effect could be real
all three kids immediately well up and look at jane
jane nervously nibbles on her fingernail as the family sits silently around the table watching a ravenous jake eat french toast bacon coffee side of fruit
his mood has been lifted
his energy is in full bloom
mommys the best cook in the world
jane is working in the garden
a shadow falls over her
she looks up jake stands before her a cute smile breaking across his face
thank you for saving me janey
jake you knew the kids were all here
shouldnt we have talked about this
agreed this was the right thing to do
this is so typical
only thinking about works for you
im sorry i guess i shouldve called before showing up
and im not sure you even left agness
maybe she saw something last night and threw you out
whats the difference
i was drowning over there
im not going to get that many more chances in my life to figure myself out
janey lets use these couple of days to see if we can make this work
we cant jake
i told you this the other night
but you were all pissy because you thought i stood you up
things are different now
im a free man
then can we just hug
i hate that youre being so distant
its literally giving me a pain in my stomach
jane reluctantly hugs him
he tries to kiss her
jane cant help but smile
can i help with what youre doing
hold your basket or
im going to go to the video store and get us all a dvd to watch tonight
well have movie night
just like old times
ill make the popcorn
just then janes cell rings
into phone hello
whispers i love knowing im coming back here
nods turning slightly oh hi
i slept great
how bout you
jake waits but realizes janes not going to turn back
the adlers are watching the graduate
the lights are low
jake shoes off hands everyone bowls of popcorn
jane sits in a club chair
harleys on the floor and the adler kids are on one long sofa all covered in a blanket
jake hands them popcorn then squeezes back in between the girls
are you here for an affair sir
the singleman party sir
jane cringes as the kids laugh
she looks over at jake snuggling between the kids all eating popcorn and laughing
he catches janes eye and mouths
jake bare legged and wearing a robe and slippers crosses to the kitchen where he finds luke and gabby digging through the fridge
are you kidding
takes out an armful of tupperware any of that noodle thing left
gabby hands it to him
she disappeared so fast after the movie
shes probably sleeping
i think shes on her computer
they all nibble out of tupperware leaning against various counters
tonight was weird
i loved tonight
thats why it was so weird
just seeing you in your robe in our kitchen
remember when you werent even allowed in
mom used to go out to the car to talk to you
handing gabby his tupperware you know i dont even really remember you and mom as a couple
what do you mean
you were ten when we broke up
i was eight actually and i dont know
its all foggy to me now
you dont remember us in hawaii or all sleeping in that tent in the backyard
yeah of course but i dont remember like you and mom hugging or waking up together
jake grabs his heart moans
im not damaged or anything
youve been good parents
speak for yourself dude
im definitely damaged from the divorce
harley and lauren enter
lauren turns the tea kettle on
why are you still here
i dont know you and mom sleeping in the same house
harley thought we should stay
jake turns his beams on harley
i just thought perhaps you might want to talk later or
is that the noodle thing
i think i ate it all
i didnt know anyone wanted any
jane sits on her bed talking to adam via isight
on her laptop screen we see adam but hes a bit of a blur
wait i cant see that one
can you back up a little
he back ups from the lens and models a rather ridiculous ski sweater
hmmm very festive
into lens gift from my ex sister in law
have no idea why i kept it
pulls sweater off into the pile
hey check out the pile jane
adam points his laptop to the floor to show a huge stack of nice
then hey the piles moving
murphy get out of there
a small mutt scurries out of the pile
re enters in an odd shirt what about this
i was in india and i had it made
adam contd the guy ran out of fabric so he didnt make me long sleeves
looks down or short sleeves
and kinda girly
taking it off not what im going for
holds up a sweater gray sweater
slips it on you sure
you dont have to say you like it just because you nixed the last things
jane likes this man
boy you have a lot of clothes
looks at the floor uh not anymore
okay were almost done
you are helping me so much by the way
adam i really have to pee
meet you back in thirty
lifting the laptop putting this on my desk
just a shot of janes pillows on her bed
im not in there
cant hear you
jake pokes his head in looks around sees no one in the room
he hears jane in the bathroom and enters quietly quickly squirms out of his boxers and t shirt then drops his robe and lies on his side on the bed
completely nude elbow up palm supporting his head a smile on his face
he changes his smile to a smoulder
jake hears water running
suddenly modest he quickly drags over the open laptop and places the open screen in front of his privates
he smiles ready to be discovered
a dries her hands at the bathroom sink
a adam crosses through the room on his way to his laptop
jane enters her bedroom sees jake and lets out a scream
simultaneously adam plops down in his desk chair looks at his screen and instantly yanks himself away in disgust
mother of looks again ahhhhhhhhhhh
jake looks down at the screen sees adams screaming face what are you doing in here
covering the screen with his hands get it off
covering himself i wanted to see you
why are you naked
sits up straight the lap top shooting even more directly at his groin why do you think
okay im gonna be sick
jake leans in covers adams eyes on the screen which of course does nothing
big close up
jake rises now his ass gets the close up he bends over to get his robe
jake spins the laptop and the isight lens lands on jane
jane and adam look at one another
no time to say anything
the door flies open the kids rush in just as jake ties his robe
no one says anything
adam listens his eyes on jane
jake crosses to jane facing the kids
he walks in and out of the isight shot
let me explain
the reason i left agness wasnt just because my marriage wasnt working
the kids wait
ive also fallen in love
back in love
with your mother
or maybe i never stopped loving her
is this a joke
i know this is shocking but i think this is the best thing thats ever happened to me
your mom and i have been seeing each other on the side
ever since new york
mom is this true
dying that part is but
i found my way back home
i just hope shell take me back
gabby breaks down in tears
lauren puts her arm around her
jane starts to cry looks at her laptop just as she hears a click and the laptop screen goes black
whys everyone crying
why isnt this good news
because were still getting over the divorce
mom are you and dad getting back together
jane looks at the kids with incredible sadness
the kids in their cars drive down the road away from the house
jane stands in the driveway watching never before feeling quite like this
jake exits the house holding his bag
he stops looks at jane
she has nothing left to say
jake gets in his car and pulls away as jane walks back inside
jane lies on a pool chaise wrapped in a blanket tissues in hand
she stares up at the night sky and as her eyes flutter shut we drift off of her
camera drifts across the pool to jane asleep on the pool chaise still wrapped in a blanket
the sprinklers go off and wake jane
she opens her eyes looks around realizes shes spent the night outside
jane sits up too fast a tad disoriented then quickly realizes what she must do
bed headed and still in his pjs
he approvingly looks at jane who stands across from him ready to right it all
glad youre here boss
harley leads jane down the narrow hall to the bedroom
now i know you dont need my advice jane but
i got this one
i know you do
jane pauses harley nods for her to go inside
her three kids are under the covers
lauren is between gabby and luke
they look like they just woke up
jane stands in the doorway
the kids dont say a word
jane doesnt wait
she crosses to the bed sits on it looks at her children
knowing how to be divorced is next to impossible
and sometimes over the years ive thought that your dad and i werent quite finished
and as it turns out we werent
so i went out of my comfort zone which i found out if youre really honest with yourself isnt all that comforting
so i experimented with a part of myself
i wanted to find out if after all these years there was still something there between us
and was there
there kinda was
lauren smiles with her eyes
but mom you have to understand how bonkers this sounds to us
for two people who for years couldnt be in the same room together
to then have an affair
you and dad
it was hard for me and i was doing it
i hope youll forgive me for confusing you or betraying your trust but i did this for me and for him and i realized even though your dad and i
once had something extraordinary
we no longer really fit together
but he is a part of me and always will be
so its over now
you guys are back to being divorced
for better or for worse
lauren takes her moms hand
harley joins them sitting on the other side of the bed holding back tears
and as they all move into hug we reverse on jane walking through adams firm
she arrives at adam is on a phone call
into phone yeah no problem
we can definitely do that
notices jane james can i call you back someone just
may i come in
i didnt call you last night because i wasnt sure you would take the call and then i thought that could go on for months and
i would have taken the call
well anyway its better to say these things in person
adam the man i was seeing was
i think im up to speed on that part
i want you to know it didnt last long and youre divorced so maybe you understand when marriages end theres doubts and hurt and youve got kids and sometimes you
wonder if you did the right thing and when the moment presented itself
i get it
i could imagine it
i told him it wasnt going to work between us but i guess he didnt believe me and unbeknownst to me he showed up at my house yesterday
he left agness and
i actually think i understand what happened but
you know im not as macho as i appear and i think its probably best for us not to get any more
involved because your relationship with jake isnt really done and i know youre saying it is but hes in love with you and for everyones sake that should probably get
so thats how grown ups talk
please tell me youre not going to quit my job and ask peter to take over because then ill never get to see you and
i was thinking of asking peter to step back in
i hope you dont
jane drives home when she notices jakes porsche in her driveway
she gets out of her car finds jake sitting on the bench swing hanging from a large oak in the front yard
jane crosses to jake
he moves over
jane sees the humor in this gesture and sits on the swing with him letting out a sigh
side by side they swing in the late afternoon breeze
jane doesnt answer right away
how far back does that sorry go
how far back do you need it to go
consider it an all inclusive apology
from not being the husband you needed to showing up nude on your bed last night
yeah what were you thinking with that move
that youd find me irresistible
jane turns to him her eyes warming up to him
never considered the alternative
gotta love that about you
they swing some more
oh man cant believe i got up to bat again and blew it
you didnt blow it
we blew it
we blew it the first time around
we just shouldve known better
too much has happened
too much time has passed
and you dont think we could make it right
does that mean you didnt feel it was totally right either
being with you jane is the best im gonna be
but do you agree that it wasnt really
it was complicated
begging for an answer
i thought it was good
i wanted it to be good
guess thats as close as im gonna get
do you always have to be so hard on me
i dont regret giving it another shot
probably wouldve been better if you hadnt been married
it may never have happened if i wasnt married
jane looks at jake knowing how true that is
they sit side by side as they sway in the breeze
i dont regret it either
they continue rocking not much more to say
as camera pulls away we its raining
trucks are pulling into the driveway as lumber is being taken off of a truck and covered in tarps
jane exits the house in a parka and under an umbrella
a group of construction guys are huddled under a make shift tarp
jane crosses toward them and as the group opens to face her she spots adam holding blue prints
jane is stunned hes there
did you know its good luck to start building in the rain
obviously lying yes
its a well known very good really lucky omen
thunder rattles the sky
looking up good i could use one
then would you all like to have your meeting in the house
its dry and ive got hot coffee
the group thanks her and heads for the house
adam stays back and walks next to jane
its a long second before someone talks
jane i need to ask you something
you wouldnt happen to have any of those amazing chocolate croissants would you
you like those huh
i have incredibly fond memories of them
i dont have any here but we could go into town and get some
right out of the oven
they turn toward the house and on their backs we hear you want to do that
